    "the integer quantum hall effect@xcite ( iqhe ) is one of very few instances where quantum effects are dramatically manifested in the _ macroscopic _ world : if a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) is placed in a large perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 , its hall resistance is quantized with high accuracy to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an integer .",
    "this quantization has been explained , within the non - interacting electron approximation , as a bulk effect , @xcite as a topological invariant,@xcite and as an edge effect .",
    "@xcite the plateau - to - plateau transitions of the hall resistance , which are accompanied by peaks in the longitudinal resistance , are understood as localization - delocalization transitions with a universal scaling relation.@xcite    a different route to observing quantum effects in condensed matter physics , is to reduce the size of the device to the so - called _ mesoscopic _ regime .",
    "if the size of the device is smaller than the phase coherence length , quantum interference between different paths leads to effects such as random universal conductance fluctuations.@xcite    what happens if the two are combined ?",
    "the answer was provided by recent iqhe experiments performed on a mesoscopic sample.@xcite the expected quantum mechanical interference of electronic wave - functions indeed causes reproducible patterns of fluctuations in the resistances near plateau - to - plateau transitions , as the magnetic field is varied ( in macroscopic samples all resistances vary smoothly with @xmath0 ) .",
    "interestingly , the fluctuations of resistances measured with different combinations of electrical contacts are not independent ; instead , various non - trivial correlations were observed .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the mesoscopic iqhe within the non - interacting electron approximation .",
    "our numerical simulations provide the basis for a unified explanation of these novel experimental observations , based on existing theories of the iqhe and mesoscopic transport ( some of these results have been summarized in ref .  ) .",

    "the experimental sample is an ingaas / inalas heterostructure with impurities ( indium atoms ) distributed throughout . as a result ,",
    "the mobility is rather low ( fractional quantum hall effect is not observed ) . even for the iqhe",
    ", only the first few plateau - to - plateau transitions can be identified .",
    "the experimental setup is sketched in fig .",
    "the hall bar is connected to six terminals , indexed 1 to 6 .",
    "the sample is considered mesoscopic because the characteristic size of its central region between the 4 central terminals , of about @xmath3 m , is comparable to the phase coherent length @xmath4m.@xcite    as customary , we denote the various resistances as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the voltage difference measured between terminals @xmath7 and @xmath8 , when the current is injected in the sample through terminal @xmath9 and extracted through terminal @xmath10 .",
    "for example , to measure the hall and longitudinal resistances , a small current @xmath11 is fed into terminal 1 and collected from terminal 4 ; no net currents are flowing in the other 4 terminals .",
    "one can then measure two longitudinal resistances @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and two hall resistances @xmath14 , @xmath15 . for any macroscopic sample ,",

    "another quantity of interest is the `` two - terminal resistance '' @xmath16 .",

    "b : the transition inside the lowest landau level @xmath24 shows the equivalent of a3 : at high-@xmath25 one finds the regime where @xmath26 , while the two longitudinal resistances have identical fluctuation patterns with extremely large amplitudes.@xcite regimes a1 and a2 are replaced here by the transition to the insulating phase , where all four resistances increase rapidly with decreasing filling factor .",

    "we show that all these observations can be explained within the non - interacting electron approximation , using a combination of ideas about the iqhe and mesoscopic transport .",
    "the linear response function of the six - terminal hall bar is the @xmath32 conductance matrix @xmath33 that defines the relationship between the currents flowing through the various leads , and their voltages : @xmath34 . here , @xmath35 is the current in the lead @xmath36 .",

    "the two - terminal resistance is determined similarly . in this case ,",
    "the electric currents flow from lead 6 to lead 3 : @xmath46 . after solving the equation @xmath47 for the corresponding voltage distribution",
    ", we can calculate immediately the two - terminal resistance ( assuming again that @xmath48 ) : @xmath49 clearly , any other measurement can be simulated in a similar fashion within this formalism .",
    "all resistances are functions of various elements of the conductance matrix .    at @xmath50 ,",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the conductance matrix @xmath33 are calculated@xcite by solving a multi - channel scattering problem , according to the landauer - buttiker formula : @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is the amplitude of probability ( transmission amplitude ) that an electron with the fermi energy @xmath53 , which is injected into the sample through the @xmath54 transverse channel of lead @xmath55 , will scatter out of the sample into the @xmath56 transverse channel of lead @xmath40 .",
    "the sum over all the transverse channels of the two leads simply gives the total probability @xmath57 for the electron with @xmath53 to scatter from lead @xmath55 into lead @xmath40 , and thus : @xmath58 the diagonal elements of the conductance matrix can then be calculated using the restrictions imposed by charge conservation and gauge invariance:@xcite @xmath59 .",

    "the strategy for the numerical simulations of the iqhe in mesoscopic samples is thus apparent .",
    "we have to solve a complicated , multi - channel scattering problem to find all the amplitudes of transmission through the hall bar .",
    "this allows us to calculate the conductance matrix and therefore the various resistances .",
    "this is repeated for many values of the fermi energy ( corresponding to different filling factors @xmath25 of the landau level ) to obtain the the traces of the resistances as @xmath25 changes .",
    "we now describe the details of our simulations .      in this section",
    "we describe the model we use to numerically simulate iqhe transitions in mesoscopic samples .",
    "this comprises the sample , the confining potential , the disorder potential , the external leads and their contacts to the sample .",
    "as already stated , we assume non - interacting electrons  the usual approximation when treating the iqhe . for numerical convenience , we ignore landau level ( ll ) mixing , although the whole formalism can be straightforwardly extended to include it .",
    "ll mixing can be ignored for large magnetic fields ( the case of interest to us ) , when the cyclotron energy is the largest energy scale in the problem . in the following ,",
    "we take the effective mass of the electron in the 2des to be that of gaas / alas heterostructures , @xmath65 , and use @xmath66 for the electron charge .      in choosing the sample geometry",
    ", we face an apparent problem . on one hand , when working with landau levels , it is convenient to consider a rectangular sample with _ periodic _ boundary conditions along one axis , since in this case the eigenstates of each ll are known analytical functions .",
    "this simplifies considerably the calculation of various matrix elements . on the other hand , however , a hall bar with different contacts on all sides , such as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is obviously not consistent with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our solution is to start with an area larger than the hall bar itself . for this enlarged area",
    "we impose cyclic boundary conditions to generate a convenient basis for the hilbert subspace of each ll .",
    "we then add a confining potential to `` carve out '' the hall bar from this larger area .",
    "this potential is described in the next subsection .",
    "consider , then , 2d electrons in an area of size @xmath67 , with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath68-direction , and placed in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the spectrum consists of landau levels of energy @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the ll index , and @xmath71 is the @xmath72-axis spin projection .",

    "( [ 2.1aa ] ) ] . since @xmath84",
    ", it follows that @xmath85 , and the degeneracy of each spin - polarized ll is @xmath86 . as we show later",
    ", @xmath87 roughly defines the size of the matrix involved in solving the scattering problem ( several more states on the contacts have to be included as well ) .    in the simulations shown here",
    ", we use @xmath88 m . for a field of several tesla , this leads to a degeneracy @xmath89 , which can be easily handled by a generic pc cluster in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "the main problem is that our sample is shorter than the experimental sample ( @xmath90 m instead of @xmath9120@xmath64 m ) .",
    "this means that terminals 1 and 4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) are much closer to the other 4 terminals than in reality .",
    "we fix this problem with the aid of the confining potential , as described in the next subsection .",
    "as stated before , we add a confining potential @xmath92 to define the hall bar from the larger area @xmath93 spanned by the ll hilbert subspace .",
    "we have tested several functional forms , to see which are physically reasonable .",
    "some of the choices considered and their pros and cons are discussed in appendix [ sconf ] .    the confining potential used in simulations is shown in fig . [ fig6 ] .",
    "it is an odd function @xmath94 and such that @xmath95 .",
    "the hall bar is the region @xmath96 and @xmath97 , where the confining potential is : @xmath98 the first line describes the main features : the confining potential is approximatively equal to @xmath99 inside the hall bar .",
    "we use @xmath100  mev in our simulations , which is much larger than the amplitude of the disorder potential ( see below ) . as a result , for fermi energies @xmath101",
    ", the electrons are confined to the region @xmath102 \\times [ -l_y/2,0]$ ] which defines the hall bar to which contacts will be attached .",
    "near the hall bar @xmath68-edges at @xmath103 , the confining potential rises smoothly to zero , on a length - scale @xmath104 ( chosen to be 40  nm in our simulations ; see discussion in appendix [ sconf ] ) .",
    "the second line describes the triangular potential barriers added in the four corners of the hall bar : @xmath105\\theta(1-x / l_x - y / l_y ) + \\\\ & & \\theta(x / l_x+ y / l_y-1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 and @xmath107 define their spatial extension .",
    "these barriers help isolate the contacts 1 and 4 from the other contacts , and thus compensate for the shortness of our sample .",
    "the alternative is to use a longer sample ; this , however , requires significantly more cpu time .",
    "the symmetric choice we made for the confining potential is not necessary ; however , it is advantageous for several reasons .",
    "if we take the disorder potential such that @xmath108 as well , then the particle - hole symmetry of the total potential for the whole sample means that all quantities must be symmetric with respect to @xmath109 .",
    "this allows us to check and calibrate the numerical procedure , as discussed in appendix [ sconf ] .",
    "another advantage of a symmetric choice is that it allows us to easily define the hall bar filling factor for @xmath110 , as being twice the filling factor of the ll ( same number of filled states , but half the area ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is an underestimate . at the fermi energies @xmath111 of interest to us ( see below ) , the effective area of the hall bar is somewhat smaller , because of the shape of the confining potential .",
    "the experimental sample contains many in impurities which serve as short range scattering centers .",
    "we simulate a short - range disorder potential @xmath112 by adding 18000 gaussian scatterers randomly placed inside the hall bar area @xmath113",
    "{ \\rm \\mu m } \\times [ -2,0]{\\rm \\mu m}$ ] .",
    "each gaussian scattering potential is of the form @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath116 m , and @xmath117 is uniformly distributed between @xmath118 $ ]  mev .    a typical disorder realization within the hall bar is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , added to the confining potential for the hall bar side of the total sample .",
    "the disorder is very rough and short - range , almost white - noise - like .",
    "moreover , its amplitude is much smaller than that of the confining potential , as required in order to have a well defined hall bar .",
    "our simulations scan a dense energy grid , typically in the range @xmath119 $ ]  mev , close to a filling factor @xmath120 for the hall bar .",
    "the iqhe is independent of the type of current - carrying external leads used and of their contacts to the sample , provided that ( i ) the leads are reasonably good metals and ( ii ) the contacts allow easy transfer of the electrons into and out of the hall bar . as a result , no detailed realistic modeling of the leads and of the contacts",
    "is required . instead",
    ", we can use simple , idealized models that satisfy requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) .    as in ref .  , we model each external lead as a collection of independent , semi - infinite , perfectly metallic one - dimensional tight - binding chains .",
    "each such chain represents a transverse channel of that lead , which carries currents independently of the other channels in the lead .",
    "the choice for the hopping matrix @xmath121 and on - site energy @xmath122 that define the hamiltonian of each such chain , has been discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "briefly , @xmath121 must be chosen so as to minimize the contact resistance .",
    "we use @xmath123  mev , comparable to the major matrix elements of the hamiltonian matrix elements inside the sample . to insure that the leads can always carry currents to and from the hall bar ,",
    "we use a `` floating '' spectrum , i.e. we set @xmath124 that we investigate . with these choices ,",
    "requirement ( i ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "the contacts are represented by matrix elements connecting states on the leads ( tight - binding sites ) to _ contact states _ in the hall bar , which are appropriate linear combinations of the ll basis states .",
    "the simplest choice is to add to the total hamiltonian a hopping term of the form @xmath125 for each chain ( transverse channel ) . here , @xmath126 is the creation operator for the last site of the chain , while @xmath115 is the annihilation operator for its corresponding contact state .",
    "the contact states are chosen so as to satisfy the following general requirements :    \\(1 ) each contact state must be localized close to the region of the hall bar where the corresponding lead is connected .",
    "\\(2 ) different leads have orthogonal contact states , but channels of the same lead may have non - orthogonal contact states .",
    "this is because the direct connection ( short circuit ) between different leads is forbidden .",
    "\\(3 ) for numerical efficiency , it is convenient to preserve the sparsity of the total hamiltonian .",
    "we therefore require that a contact state is a linear combination of a small subset of the @xmath87 ll basis states .    for leads 1 and 4",
    "( the current source and drain , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the contact states must be localized close to the @xmath127 ends of the sample .",
    "the ll basis states @xmath128 with @xmath129 are exactly such states . for simplicity , we take each of them to be a contact state , as in ref .  .",
    "specifically , we assume that leads 1 and 4 have @xmath130 transverse channels each ( we use @xmath131 in the simulations shown here ) .",
    "the @xmath132 transverse channel of the lead 1 ( 4 ) is coupled through a hopping term to the ll basis state @xmath128 with @xmath133 , and respectively @xmath134 , @xmath135 . with this choice ,",
    "all contact states are orthogonal to one another , and all three requirements listed above are satisfied .",
    "this means that electrons can be injected / removed from the hall bar anywhere within a strip of width @xmath136 from the @xmath127 edges , through contacts 1 and 4 .    for the voltage probes ( leads 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 ) we need a different strategy , since they are located on the @xmath137 , respectively @xmath138 edges of the hall bar .",
    "the contact states are chosen to be of the form : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a parameter that controls the @xmath83 and @xmath68 extension of the wave - function , @xmath141 for @xmath142 respectively , and @xmath104 is the normalization factor . as @xmath140 changes , the shape of this wavefunction changes from a strip in the @xmath83-direction to a strip in the @xmath68-direction with fixed total area .",
    "we choose @xmath143 so that the probability distribution of the contact states overlaps with the region of smooth variation of the confining potential near the @xmath68-edges . in this case , the profile of the contact states is an ellipse with its longer axis in the @xmath68-direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ e2.2 ] ) , @xmath144 specifies the location of the contact state along the @xmath68-edge .",
    "we use @xmath145 ( @xmath146 , in these simulations ) tight - binding chains for each of these leads , and correspondingly @xmath145 different contact states . for",
    "leads 3 and 5 , the centers @xmath144 of their contact states are distributed uniformly in the range @xmath147\\mu$]m , while for leads 2 and 6 the range is @xmath148\\mu$]m .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ e2.2 ] ) is truncated so that no pair of neighboring contact states contain the same ll basis states in their expansions .",
    "the contact states on the @xmath149 edge ( for leads 2 and 3 ) , are magnetic translations of the corresponding states of leads 5 and 6 .",
    "the alternating phase factor @xmath150 insures that contact states on different @xmath68-edges are orthogonal to one another , so that short - circuits are avoided .",
    "the total hamiltonian is the sum of the sample hamiltonian , the hamiltonians for the 6 leads , and the terms describing the contacts between sample and leads : @xmath151 the numerical results presented here are obtained in the lowest landau level ( lll ) with @xmath24 ( the spin projection is irrelevant .",
    "calculations in higher ll proceed in a similar fashion ) . for simplicity , in the following",
    "we denote the lll basis states by @xmath152 . in the hilbert subspace of the spin - polarized lll ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the sample is : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the number of states in a ll and an overall constant lll energy shift @xmath155 has been ignored .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath156 of the confining and disorder potentials are computed as described in ref .  .",

    "( the generalization for higher lls and/or ll mixing is straightforward , see for instance eq .",
    "( 7 ) in ref .  ) .",
    "the strategy , then , is to perform a fast fourier transform of the potentials on a grid dense enough to reproduce them with high accuracy while maintaining the sparseness of the hamiltonian .",
    "the matrix element of each fourier component is given by the previous formula , allowing one to efficiently compute the matrix elements of the confining and disorder potentials .",
    "note that for higher lls , the matrix elements differ only by a laguerre polynomial .",
    "this is not likely to influence the physics in a significant way and suggests that numerical results for higher lls should be qualitatively similar to those we present here for the lll .",
    "the leads are collections of @xmath159 semi - infinite tight - binding chains , each describing a transverse channel : @xmath160\\ ] ] thus , @xmath161 creates an electron on the site @xmath162 of the @xmath163 transverse channel of lead @xmath40 .",
    "we use the convention that site @xmath164 is always the end site of the chain .",
    "the solution we present can be trivially generalized to allow for different @xmath122 and @xmath121 parameters for each channel , as well as longer - range hopping .",
    "however , since the physics in the sample is independent of the lead details ( as long as the leads can carry currents to and from the sample ) the simple choice we make should be sufficient .",
    "the choices for @xmath165 and number of channels @xmath159 for each lead have been discussed previously .",

    "again , generalizations for more complex contacts can be easily incorporated , but should not be necessary .",
    "we now have to solve a scattering problem for an electron injected with energy @xmath167 in the channel @xmath10 of lead @xmath55 , which means that we must find an eigenstate @xmath168 of the form @xmath169|{\\rm vacuum}\\rangle\\ ] ] where  with our convention for indexing channel sites  @xmath170 .",

    "we solve this scattering problem by recasting it as a _",
    "finite - size , inhomogeneous _ system of linear equations , which can be easily solved numerically .",

    "this solution is explained in detail in ref .",
    ", for two leads with multiple channels .",
    "the redistribution of the channels amongst more leads is trivial , since it only involves changing some of the matrix elements to the appropriate contact states .",
    "the solution of this inhomogeneous system of linear equations , then , directly gives us the transmission coefficients @xmath177 from which we compute the conductance matrix [ see eq .",

    "[ fig8 ] , for a magnetic field @xmath181 t .",
    "two facts are immediately apparent .",
    "first , for low filling factors ( @xmath182 for this disorder realization ) , the conductance matrix is symmetric to high accuracy , @xmath183 . from eq .",
    "( [ ne1 ] ) it follows that @xmath184 , i.e. the electron has the same ( very small ) probability to scatter in both directions .",
    "this is expected , since we know that at low filling factors , the states in the lll are localized . scattering from one terminal to another",
    "is only possible through tunneling of the electron from a state localized near one terminal , into a state localized near the other terminal .",
    "such tunneling amplitudes are very small , explaining the small total probabilities for such scattering .",
    "tunneling is also time - reversal symmetric  it happens with the same probability in both directions , consistent with the symmetry of the conductance matrix .",
    "these ideas will be made more precise in section [ sglparam ] , where we analyze the general structure allowed for the conductance matrix .",
    "the second observation is that at high - filling factors @xmath185 , we have @xmath186 ( where if @xmath187 ) while all other off - diagonal matrix elements become vanishingly small . in other words , an electron injected through terminal @xmath188 scatters with unit probability into terminal @xmath40 .",
    "this behavior clearly signals the appearance of the _ edge states _ at higher filling factors .",
    "these are chiral states , carrying electrons only in the direction consistent with the orientation ( sign of ) the magnetic field @xmath0 .",

    "in fact , we can see that the larger the various chiral terms , the smaller these corrections should be .",
    "this agrees with the experimental data , where the largest violations of this symmetry are observed between the neighboring large fluctuation peaks in @xmath413 , on the low-@xmath25 side of the central regime . from eq .",
    "( [ e4.11 ] ) , we know that those sharp peaks are caused by fluctuating chiral components of the conductance matrix , such as @xmath414 and @xmath415 . from eqs .",
    "( [ e4.15 ] ) , we see that when these parameters are large ( peak value in @xmath413 ) , the difference between @xmath411 and @xmath412 is suppressed .",
    "when @xmath413 is closer to @xmath416 , however , the chiral terms are smaller and the corrections to the difference becomes more noticeable .",
    "in all these correction terms , powers of @xmath7 appear in the denominator .",
    "since @xmath7 is the number of underlying filled lls , these corrections should be smaller in higher lls and therefore the symmetries and correlations should be easier to observe .",
    "they have been experimentally observed in higher lls,@xcite but they are not so clear as in the first plateau - to - plateau transition .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the sample quality is rather poor and only the first transition is clearly observed.@xcite secondly , a smaller magnetic field is needed to reach higher lls .",
    "as the cyclotron energy is reduced , inter - landau level mixing and other effects which we did not consider in these simulations may start to become important .",
    "to summarize , in this study we show that first - principles simulations of the iqhe in mesoscopic samples , based on the multi - terminal landauer formalism appropriate for non - interacting electrons , recapture all the non - trivial correlations and symmetries recently observed experimentally .",
    "moreover , we explain how these correlations and symmetries are direct consequences of the general allowed structure of the conductance matrix .",
    "similar to the experiments , we find that the iqhe transition in higher lls is naturally divided into three regimes . on the low-@xmath25 side of the transition ,",
    "the ll hosting @xmath53 is insulating .",
    "if tunneling between left and right sides is also small , the fluctuations of pairs of resistances are correlated with excellent accuracy , i.e. @xmath417 .",
    "this condition is obeyed if the typical size of the wave - function ( localization length ) is less than the distance between contacts 2 and 3 .",
    "when the localization length becomes comparable to this distance , edge states begin to be established and the correlation between @xmath199 and @xmath197 is lost . on the high-@xmath25 side of the transition ,",
    "the edge states are established and responsible for most of the charge transport .",
    "however , localized states inside the sample can help electrons tunnel between opposite edges , leading to back - scattering like the jain - kivelson model . in this case ,",
    "our simulations show that the two @xmath199 fluctuate with identical patterns , while the @xmath197 are quantized .",
    "tunneling between opposite edges is likely only if the typical size of the wave - functions is slightly shorter than the distance between opposite edges .",
    "it is then apparent that the central regime in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] corresponds to the so - called `` critical region '' , where the typical size of the electron wave - function is larger than the sample size ( distance between contacts 2 and 3 , at low-@xmath25 , or between 2 and 6 at high-@xmath25 ) . in these mesoscopic samples , the voltage probes act as markers on a ruler , measuring the size of the wave - functions at the fermi energy . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first time when the boundaries of the critical region are pinpointed experimentally .",
    "this opens up exciting possibilities for experimentally testing the predictions of the localization theory of iqhe .",
    "conductance fluctuations at the iqhe transitions have been studied before by several authors .",
    "cho and fisher  @xcite and wang _",
    "et al._@xcite have focused on the two - terminal conductance , with numerical simulations based on chalker and coddington s network model.@xcite ando has numerically computed conductances for two- and four - terminal samples,@xcite using the bttiker - landauer formalism , but in the green s function formulation that requires the discretization of the sample to a lattice model.@xcite their results are consistent with ours , showing fluctuations in the resistances which are random , sample - dependent , and of order of @xmath211 .",
    "steda , kucera and macdonald@xcite were the first to predict the relations @xmath418 and @xmath419 , using an analytical analysis of the landauer formula for a `` two - terminal '' sample , but which has the upper and lower sides of each terminal held at different voltages . in effect , their current source and drain ( leads 1 and 4 ) are moved to infinity , and connected to the central sample through edge states only .",
    "this is a special case of our general model of eq .",
    "( [ e4.10 ] ) .",
    "bttiker  @xcite presented a detailed analysis of four - terminal systems , similar to our analysis of the six - terminal conductance matrix .",
    "he predicted the symmetry relations between conductance measurements which exchange the role of the voltage and current leads .",
    "however , it is essential to emphasize that neither two , nor four - terminal samples ( with terminals at well defined voltages ) can simultaneously measure both a hall and a longitudinal resistance .",
    "this is obvious for a two - terminal measurement , which can measure a single two - terminal conductance @xmath420 . for a four - terminal geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig28 ] ) , consider the case of @xmath7 filled landau levels , @xmath421 . we know that each ll will transport charge through a set of edge states , such as those sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig28 ] .",
    "the conductance matrix in this case is : @xmath422{cccc } -1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & -1\\\\ \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] taking leads 1 and 3 as the current source and drain , @xmath423 and assuming that lead 3 is grounded , one can solve @xmath424 for the other 3 voltages .",
    "one finds trivially that @xmath425 and @xmath426 .",
    "thus , even though at first sight one might assume that one can measure a hall resistance @xmath427 and a longitudinal resistance @xmath428 , it turns out that in fact both measurements give resistances exhibiting plateaus at quantized values @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "both results are related to a hall resistance ( a longitudinal resistance should be zero when @xmath421 .",
    "note that at transitions between the plateaus , the two resistances need not be equal , since the partially filled ll will introduce other off - diagonal matrix elements . using the type of analysis we introduced in section [ sglparam ] , one could now easily study what types of correlations might be possible in such a geometry ) .",
    "if one now compares this to a 6-terminal case , it becomes obvious that the four - terminal resistances have no reason to be related to the @xmath197 measured in the six - terminals by experimentalists .",
    "thus , in order to simulate and understand the experimental results , it is essential to use the six - terminal geometry .",
    "these considerations show that for mesoscopic samples , a full specification of the experimental setup is absolutely necessary for any interpretation of the measured quantities .",
    "for example , the various correlations and symmetries that we studied in this paper only appear in the six - lead setup .",
    "other geometries can be analyzed similarly .",
    "a significant result of our work is the proof that an understanding of various possible ( robust ) correlations can be obtained based on simple arguments regarding the general allowed structure of the conductance matrix , without need for detailed numerical simulations .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the full dc response function ( the conductance matrix ) of a mesoscopic sample is characterized by a large number of parameters ( 12 , for our six - terminal geometry , when we ignore the small tunneling between the left and right - side of the hall bar ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with macroscopic samples which only require two parameters , the hall and longitudinal conductivities @xmath429 and @xmath430 , to fully characterize their dc response .",
    "a mesoscopic sample obviously has more degrees of freedom to display fluctuations of its resistances .",

    "the confining potential is needed to define the hall bar out of the larger area spanned by each ll hilbert subspace .",
    "it is convenient to make a symmetric choice .",
    "we take the confining potential to be negative in the region @xmath431 ( which is thus the hall bar ) and positive in the remaining region @xmath432 ( the inverted hall bar ) and such that @xmath433 . on the @xmath68-edges of the hall bar",

    "secondly , raising the confining potential to near zero at the @xmath83-edges , as shown in the same case , also leads to undesired consequences , for example half quantization @xmath447 over a considerable energy range .",
    "this is because leads 1 and 4 are only connected to the left - most and right - most ll states . in this case , the energies of these states are close to zero , so they appear to be huge barriers blocking the electrons on the lead to enter the sample .",
    "electrons can only tunnel through these barriers with very small probabilities , and no chiral currents can exit at the @xmath83-edges unless @xmath448 .",
