    "we consider the grassmannian @xmath0 , the set of two - planes inside @xmath1 .",
    "a plane @xmath2 is given by two linearly independent vectors or by any two linear combinations of them that are independent , so @xmath3 there is a transitive action of @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) on @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath6 if we consider a particular point @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9    we notice that the conformal group of space time , @xmath10 , has spin group @xmath11 .",
    "its complexification , @xmath12 , has spin group @xmath13 .    how to extract the minkowski space from @xmath0 ?",
    "notice that since the two vectors are independent , @xmath14 at least one of the @xmath15 determinants in this matrix is @xmath16 .",
    "the space is covered by the atlas @xmath17 @xmath18 is the _ big cell _ , and using the @xmath19 freedom , a plane in @xmath18 can be represented by @xmath20 with the entries of @xmath21 totally arbitrary .",
    "so @xmath22 , and it is a good candidate for the minkowski space .",
    "what about the group action ?",
    "@xmath18 is left invariant by the _",
    "lower parabolic _ subgroup of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and it acts on @xmath21 as @xmath25 the group is @xmath26 so it is the poincar group where instead of the lorentz group we have put its double cover .",
    "@xmath21 belongs to the _ twistor space _ associated to spacetime . using the pauli matrices",
    ", we can revert to the spacetime notation and obtain the standard action of the poincar group on minkowski spacetime @xmath27 also the spacetime metric has an interpretation in the twistor formalism , @xmath28",
    "quantization of spacetime means to deform the commutative algebra of functions ( can be polynomials or smooth functions ) to a non commutative algebra .",
    "other properties that we want to consider in the quantum setting have to be first defined in the algebraic formalism and then quantized. this is the case of the group actions . the respective algebras are @xmath29/ ( \\det g-1),\\qquad a , b=1,\\dots , 4.\\ ] ] @xmath30/ ( \\det x\\cdot \\det y -1 ) , \\qquad    i , j=1,2,\\quad   a , b=3,4.\\ ] ] @xmath31.\\ ] ] the group law is expressed in terms of a _ coproduct _ @xmath32with the property @xmath33    the action on the minkowski space is a _ coaction _ @xmath34",
    "in refs . @xcite one substitutes the group @xmath13 by @xmath35 in the twistor construction .",
    "all the scheme of coaction and big cell can be repeated in the quantum case , which gives a quantization for the minkowski space as a big cell inside a quantum conformal space ( a quantum grassmannian ) .",
    "we just state the result : the quantum minkowski space is a quantum matrix algebra with the rows interchanged .",
    "the correspondence @xmath36 is given in terms of the respective generators : @xmath37    this means that the commutation relations among the quantum generators are the following @xmath38 what happened to the groups ? they have become _ quantum groups _ with a non commutative product and a coproduct that is _ the same _ than the one we had before .",
    "this means that the group law has not changed , nor the coaction on the grassmannian and the minkowski space .",
    "the only change is that all these varieties have become non commutative .",
    "it is a remarkable property of matrix quantum groups that the coproduct is compatible with both , the commutative product and the non commutative one .    in the quantum version @xmath39 ,",
    "the sets of generators @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are separately isomorphic to @xmath15 matrix algebras , but while @xmath40 and @xmath41 commute among them , @xmath43 does not commute with the rest of the generators .",
    "a quantum matrix algebra is an algebra over @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 is a parameter .",
    "moreover , as a module over @xmath46 , it is a free module , which means that it has a basis .",
    "it is well known that there is at least one _ ordering _ among the generators such that the standard monomials associated to this ordering are a basis of the quantum matrix algebra .",
    "( this is a non trivial property ) .",
    "the ordering is the following @xmath47 and then there is an isomorphism ( _ ordering rule _ or _ quantization map _ ) between @xmath48 and @xmath49 $ ] :    @xmath50@ > q_{\\mathrm{m}}>>{\\mathcal{o}}_q({\\mathrm{m}})\\\\t_{41}^a t_{42}^b t_{31}^c   t_{32}^d @ > > > { \\hat{t}}_{41}^a { \\hat{t}}_{42}^b   { \\hat{t}}_{31}^c   { \\hat{t}}_{32}^d\\end{cd}.\\ ] ]    with the quantization map we can pull back the non commutative product to @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "this defines a _ star product _ ,    @xmath51,\\ ] ] which can be computed _ explicitly _",
    "@xmath52    @xmath53 are numerical factors defined recursively .",
    "we recover the semiclassical interpretation of the algebra being an algebra of functions , but with a star product .",
    "the previous formula for the star product is nice and compact , but can only be computed on polynomials .",
    "can we extend it to smooth functions ? not obvious .",
    "we prove that there exists a ( unique ) differential star product that coincides with the one given above on polynomials .",
    "change of the parameter : @xmath54 .",
    "we expand in powers of @xmath55 so we obtain a star product of the form @xmath56 with @xmath57    at each order , we have contributions from each of the terms with different @xmath58 @xmath59 we want to write @xmath60 as a bidifferential operator . but this is not trivial because all the dependence in the exponents should cancel .",
    "@xmath61 antisymmetrizing and changing variables we obtain the poisson bracket @xmath62    notice that if the @xmath40 s are real , then the poisson bracket is pure imaginary . also , it is quadratic .",
    "we have computed explicitly up to the order @xmath63 , but the expression is already too big to display it here .",
    "we looked for an argument to show it at arbitrary order .",
    "this can be done by careful inspection .",
    "the proof that it is differential at each order is rather technical and we do not reproduce it here @xcite but having the explicit formula for the polynomials is essential to apply the argument .",
    "an example of the possible difficulty : suppose that we want to reproduce @xmath64 as the result of applying a differential operator to @xmath65 .",
    "we have several choices ,    @xmath66 but none of them is both , independent on the exponent @xmath67 and polynomial in the variable .",
    "so the right combination of coefficients should appear in order to cancel the factors that appear when differentiating .",
    "for example , if the result were @xmath68 , then we have a differential operator @xmath69    since we have recovered the interpretation of functions for the non commutative algebra , we can try to express the coaction as an action of this space of functions . remember that , formally , for the generators the coaction is the same than in the commutative algebra .",
    "we just need to pull it back to the star product algebra .",
    "we define the transformed variables ( no translations are considered here ) @xmath70    @xmath71 one just has to expand the star products in the right hand side .",
    "up to order @xmath55 we have computed it in terms of a differential operator , @xmath72 and the coefficients are polynomials of order 6 in the variables @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 be a commutative algebra over @xmath75 .",
    "an involution @xmath76 of @xmath74 is an antilinear map satisfying , for @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath79 let us consider the set of fixed points of @xmath76 , @xmath80 it is easy to see that this is a real algebra whose complexification is @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath81 is a _",
    "real form _ of @xmath74 .",

    "a few things change :    * checking with the commutation relations they are antiautomorphisms , this is @xmath89 * this discards the interpretation of the real form of the non commutative algebra as the set of fixed points of the involution . *",
    "when pulling back to the star product algebra , the poisson bracket is purely imaginary .",
    "finally one finds also the corresponding involutions in the group ,    @xmath90    it is not difficult to realize that in the minkowskian case the real form of the lorentz group ( corresponding to the generators @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) is @xmath91 and in the euclidean case is @xmath92 .",
