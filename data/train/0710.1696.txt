    "because of its intermediate mass , the strange quark has a special status in low - energy qcd . it is light enough to allow for a combined expansion of observables in powers of @xmath3 around the @xmath4 chiral limit ( meaning 3 massless flavours ) : @xmath5 .",
    "but it is sufficiently heavy to induce significant changes from the @xmath4 limit to the @xmath6 limit : @xmath7 and @xmath0 physical .",
    "each limit can engender its own version of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath8pt ) . in the @xmath6 limit ,",
    "the pions are the only degrees of freedom , whereas @xmath4 @xmath8pt deals with pions , kaons and @xmath9 .",
    "this second version of @xmath8pt is richer , discusses more processes in a larger range of energy , but contains more unknown low - energy constants ( lecs ) and may have a slower convergence .",
    "the details of the connection between the two theories remain under debate .",
    "indeed , due to @xmath10 sea - pairs , order parameters such as the quark condensate and the pseudoscalar decay constant , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , can reach significantly different values in the two chiral limits ( @xmath13 denoting the chiral limit with @xmath14 massless flavours )  @xcite .",
    "an illustation is provided by the quark condensate : @xmath15 here , @xmath10-pairs are involved through the two - point correlator @xmath16 , which violates the zweig rule in the vacuum ( scalar ) channel .",
    "one expects  @xcite that this effect should suppress order parameters when @xmath17 : @xmath18 and @xmath19 . since the quark condensate(s ) and the pseudoscalar decay constant(s ) are the leading - order lecs for the two versions of @xmath8pt , a strong decrease from @xmath6 to @xmath20 would have an impact on the structure of the two theories .",
    "a few years ago , the e865 collaboration provided new data on @xmath21 decays  @xcite . building upon the dispersive analysis of @xmath1 scattering  @xcite , we extracted the two - flavour order parameters  @xcite : @xmath22 a different analysis , with an additional theoretical input from the scalar radius of the pion , led to an even larger value for @xmath23  @xcite . the situation is somewhat modified by new data from the na48 collaboration  @xcite , which show some discrepancy with the e865 phase shifts in the higher end of the allowed phase space .",
    "the role of isospin breaking corrections is under discussion currrently .",
    "the preliminary values of the phase shifts  @xcite tend to increase the value of the @xmath24 @xmath1 scattering length , and to decrease the value of the two - flavour quark condensate , pushing @xmath23 down to 0.7 . in any case",
    ", one would expect values closer to 1 , since @xmath23 and @xmath25 monitor the convergence of @xmath6 chiral expansions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "such expansions in powers of @xmath28 and @xmath29 _ only _ should exhibit smaller nlo corrections ( below 10% )  @xcite .    to include @xmath30- and @xmath9-mesons dynamically",
    ", one must use three - flavour @xmath8pt around the @xmath4 chiral limit .",
    "strange sea - quark loops may affect chiral series by damping the leading - order ( lo ) term , which depends on @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and by enhancing next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections , in particular when violating the zweig rule in the scalar sector .",
    "take for instance : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and we have put together nlo low - energy constants and chiral logarithms @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( enhanced by @xmath0 ) .",
    "if we assume that the lo contribution is numerically dominant ( i.e. , @xmath37 to a very good approximation ) , we can perform the following manipulations : @xmath38 where we have used @xmath39 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] ) at the second step , and the second and third terms of the last equality are obtained using @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively  @xcite .",
    "this is clearly in contradiction with the orginal assumption @xmath42 .",
    "the available dispersive estimates of @xmath43  @xcite yield a similar situation for @xmath44  citeresum .",
    "therefore , a small positive value of @xmath45 or @xmath46 is enough to spoil the rapid convergence of @xmath4 chiral series and to induce a numerical competition between formal lo and nlo contributions .",
    "( left ) and @xmath47 ( right ) . in each case",

    "the potentially `` large '' values of @xmath48 and @xmath43 lead to a numerical competition between formal lo and nlo contributions in chiral series . to deal with such a situation ,",
    "we have introduced a framework , called resummed chiral perturbation theory ( re@xmath8pt )  @xcite , where we define the appropriate observables to consider and the treatment of their chiral expansion  @xcite .",
    "it allows for a a resummation of the potentially large effect of the zweig - rule violating couplings @xmath48 and @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "since this framework copes with the possibility of a numerical competition between ( formal ) lo and nlo terms in chiral series , some usual @xmath49 results are not valid any longer : for instance @xmath50 is not fixed by @xmath51 and may vary from 8 to 40 .    one can apply this framework to @xmath1 and @xmath2 scatterings , which provide information on @xmath6 and @xmath4 patterns of chiral symmetry breaking respectively , and in particular on @xmath50 , the quark condensate @xmath47 and the decay constant @xmath52 .",
    "one can exploit dispersive relations , such as roy equations  @xcite and roy - steiner equations  @xcite , to reconstruct the amplitudes from the phase shifts from threshold up to energies around 1 gev .",
    "matching the dispersive and chiral representations of the amplitude in a frequentist framework provides constraints ( in terms of confidence levels ) on the main parameters of interest for three - flavour @xmath8pt  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cls ] shows the situation for @xmath50 and @xmath47 .",
    "the main impact of @xmath1 scattering consists in constraining @xmath50 : indeed , @xmath1 scattering pins down the two - flavour condensate @xmath23 rather accurately , which can be related to @xmath53 through the spectrum of pseudoscalar mesons  @xcite .",

    "the presence of massive @xmath55-pairs in the qcd vacuum may induce significant differences in the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking between the @xmath6 and @xmath4 chiral limits .",
    "this effect , related to the violation of the zweig rule in the scalar sector , may spoil the convergence of three - flavour chiral expansions .",
    "we introduce resummed chiral perturbation theory to deal with such a problem , and apply it to our experimental knowledge on @xmath1 and @xmath2 scatterings .",
    "the outcome does not favour the usual picture of a large quark condensation independent of the number of massless flavours .",
    "further experimental information is needed to constrain the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking efficiently and learn more about its variation with @xmath14 .",
