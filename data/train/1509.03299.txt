    "clusters of galaxies are the largest virialized structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "they form via a hierarchical sequence of mergers and accretion of smaller systems driven by dark matter that dominates the gravitational field .",
    "the majority of baryonic matter in clusters is in the form of a hot ( t @xmath0 k ) and tenuous ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) gas , the intra - cluster - medium ( icm ) .",
    "the icm is a unique environment for plasma physics due to the combination of its weakly collisional nature and high plasma beta .",
    "it also provides situations for cr acceleration and dynamics that differ significantly from those in other astrophysical environments .",
    "first of all , the bulk of crs are confined and accumulated in the very large volumes of galaxy clusters for hubble time @xcite .",
    "second , the life - time of crs in the icm is very long as crs diffuse in a dilute high - beta plasma @xcite . under these conditions",
    "particle acceleration mechanisms that are notoriously not very efficient , such as stochastic fermi - ii mechanisms , become important because they can act for very long times - scales and on very large volumes .",
    "another point is that the combination of crs confinement and long life - time with the complex dynamics of the icm implies that crs can experience phases of cooling and ( re)acceleration by different mechanisms .",
    "this results in a complex energy and spatial distribution of the crs in clusters@xcite .",
    "clearly galaxy clusters contain several _ discrete _ sources of crs , including galaxies and agns .",
    "however there is much more . indeed",
    "radio observations show cluster - scale diffuse synchrotron sources in a fraction of galaxy clusters , the most prominent ones are _ giant radio halos _ that cover mpc@xmath3 volumes @xcite .",
    "these emissions are not directly associated with discrete sources and require _ in situ _ mechanisms of particle acceleration in the icm @xcite . _ radio halos _ are observed in cluster mergers @xcite , suggesting that a fraction of the kinetic energy of large - scale motions can be channelled into electromagnetic fluctuations and particle acceleration at smaller scales in the icm .",
    "in fact this point is telling us that a complex hierarchy of processes are active in the icm at different scales , and offers a possibility to constrain fundamental aspects of the microphysics of the icm .",
    "the synchrotron spectra of _ radio halos _ are steep with spectral slopes measured at ghz frequencies @xmath4 ( flux @xmath5 ) suggesting that the underlying acceleration mechanisms are not very efficient @xcite . a popular scenario for the origin of _ radio halos _",
    "is based on the possibility that turbulence generated during cluster - cluster mergers ( re)accelerates seeds electrons distributed on mpc@xmath3-volumes to energies @xmath6 few gev , that are requested to produce the synchrotron radiation observed in the radio band @xcite .",
    "this scenario allows to explain the very extended and diffuse nature of the observed emission of _ radio halos _ and the tight connection between _ radio halos _ and dynamics of the hosting clusters . on the other hand crucial ingredients in this scenario",
    "are poorly known .",
    "primarily the challenge is to understand the chain of mechanisms that transport energy from large scales to collisionless small - scales in the icm .    in this paper",
    "we focus on cre acceleration by compressive turbulence driven at large scales in the icm .",
    "specifically we explore the changes in the efficiency of acceleration that are induced by different assumptions on the turbulent spectrum and icm microphysics .",
    "in this section we briefly review the current view of the properties of turbulence in galaxy clusters .",
    "galaxy clusters contain many potential sources of turbulence @xcite , the most important for large - scale turbulence are mergers between clusters .",
    "mergers deeply stir and rearrange the cluster structure generating turbulence through sloshing of cluster cores , shearing instabilities in the icm and via the complex patterns of interacting shocks that form during mergers and structure formation more generally .",
    "such a complex ensemble of mechanisms should drive both compressive and incompressive turbulence , as also supported by the analysis of numerical ( fluid ) simulations@xcite .",
    "large - scale motions that are driven during cluster - cluster mergers and dark matter sub - halo motions are expected on scales comparable to cluster cores scales , @xmath7 kpc , and might have typical velocities @xmath8 km s@xmath9 @xcite . these motions are subsonic , typically with @xmath10 , but super - alfvnic , with @xmath11 .",
    "an open question is whether these motions generate an efficient turbulent cascade at smaller scales or if they are dissipated at larger scales .",
    "the coulomb mfp of particles in the icm is very large , @xmath12 kpc , which in turns implies a moderate value of the _ reynolds _ number in the icm , @xmath13 , for typical parameters .",
    "such a moderate _ reynolds _ number would not guarantee _ per se _ an efficient turbulent cascade .",
    "however the icm is a magnetised and _ weakly collisional _ high - beta medium , that is notoriously unstable to several instabilities @xcite , implying that collisionless effects govern microphysics and make the medium more turbulent .",
    "the combination of these facts suggests that the icm is turbulent .",
    "we note that this conclusion is also supported by similarities with the ipm , that is also _ weakly collisional _",
    ", magnetised and ( moderately ) high - beta plasma .",
    "in fact the _ reynolds _ number ( considering coulomb collisions ) of the ipm would not be large , but the ipm is _ observed _ to be turbulent @xcite .    at large scales , where the bulk of turbulence is generated by cluster dynamics in the icm , turbulence is hydrodynamic with kinetic energy of motions being in excess of magnetic energy . at scales smaller than the mhd - scale , @xmath14 (",
    "using kolmogorov scaling for hydro - turbulence ) , turbulence becomes mhd provided that the icm behaves a fluid and that collisionless effects play a role only at smaller scales .",
    "mhd turbulence can be described by goldreuch - sridhar model with alfvn and slow modes developing anisotropic spectrum@xcite .",
    "on one hand we can thought that solenoidal and compressive turbulence are generated at large scales and cascade at smaller scales , at the same time however we should expect that turbulence can also be generated directly at smaller scales in response of plasma / kinetic instabilities and coherent wave phenomena driven by the cascade of strong mhd turbulence @xcite ; the energy associated with small - scale turbulence is however subdominant . both large - scale motions ( and their cascading at smaller scales ) and",
    "the variety of waves excited at small scales should play crucial roles in governing the micro - physics of the icm through the scattering of particles and the perturbation and amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the efficiency of the transport of turbulent energy from large to small scales and the efficiency of generation of waves at smaller scales are still open issues .",
    "the nonlinear interplay between particles and turbulent waves / modes induces a stochastic process that drains energy from plasma turbulence to particles @xcite .",
    "turbulent acceleration is invoked for the origin of _ giant radio halos_. acceleration of crs directly from the thermal pool to relativistic energies by mhd turbulence in the icm is very inefficient and faces serious problems due to associated energy arguments @xcite .",
    "consequently , turbulent acceleration in the icm is rather a matter of reacceleration of pre - existing ( seed ) crs rather than _ ab initio _ acceleration of crs .",
    "this poses the problem of the origin of the seed particles , a problem that is currently subject of active discussion@xcite , but that will not be addressed in this paper .",
    "presumably the many types of waves generated / excited in the icm , both at large and very small scales , jointly contribute to the scattering process and ( re)acceleration of crs . in the last years",
    "much attention has been devoted to cr reacceleration due to compressible turbulence that is driven at large scales in the icm from cluster mergers and that cascades to smaller scales@xcite .",
    "this is the simplest scenario that can be thought , nevertheless it naturally predicts a direct connection between cluster mergers and _ radio halos_. in fact several studies suggest that turbulent reacceleration by compressive modes provides a plausible explanation for _ radio halos_@xcite , although several ingredients of the physics of this mechanim are still poorly known .    in the following",
    "we will discuss transit - time - damping ( ttd ) resonance ( sect.3 ) and non - resonant acceleration by turbulent compressions ( sect.4 ) , exploring the effects induced on the efficiency of these mechanisms by different assumptions .",
    "compressible component of the magnetic field of compressible modes ( i.e. the component along @xmath15 in the case of oblique propagation ) can interact with particles through ttd resonance @xcite .",
    "the condition for resonance is :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the components of the waves wavenumber and particle velocity parallel to the magnetic field ; @xmath19 for fast modes ( magnetosonic waves ) in the icm .",
    "this interaction is essentially a coupling between the magnetic moment of particles and the ( parallel ) magnetic field gradients .",
    "this interaction , in combination with _ additional / external _ sources of pitch - angle scattering / isotropization during acceleration@xcite resonance changes only the component of particle momentum parallel to the seed magnetic field that would increase the degree of anisotropy of particle distribution and decrease the acceleration efficiency with time ] , is considered as a fundamental way to accelerate particles in different astrophysical environments , including the icm .",
    "stochastic acceleration can be described as a diffusion in the momentum space of particles . for ttd the expression of diffusion coefficient ,",
    "assuming quasi - isotropic turbulent cascade and high - beta plasma ( conditions suitable for the icm ) , is given in @xcite :    @xmath20 \\int_{k_o}^{k_{cut } } dk w_b(k ) k \\label{dppttd}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21= cosine of pitch angle , @xmath22 is the heaviside step function ( 1 for @xmath23 , and 0 otherwise ) , @xmath24 is the energy spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the injection and cut - off scales ( wavenumber ) of the fluctuations .",
    "the most important ingredients in eq.[dppttd ] are the energy density of electromagnetic fluctuations and their spectrum , and the cut - off scale of the turbulent ( magnetic fluctuations ) spectrum @xmath26 . in the simple scenario adopted in this paper , where turbulence is generated at large scale and cascade at smaller scales ,",
    "the minimum scale @xmath26 is the scale where the mechanisms of damping of turbulence become faster than turbulent cascade . during acceleration energy",
    "goes into particles increasing the damping of turbulence due to particles themselves ( the cut - off scale @xmath27 increases ) and reducing the acceleration efficiency .",
    "constraining @xmath26 is thus critical to obtain meaningful estimates of the acceleration efficiency .    to do that we need to calculate the damping of turbulence in the icm and the efficiency of turbulent cascade . following the motivations given in @xcite",
    "we assume that collisionless dampings with particles are the dominant ones in the icm .",
    "the damping is obtained assuming quasi - linear - theory @xcite :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the anti - hermitian part of the plasma dielectric tensor @xcite , @xmath30 is the total energy in the modes , @xmath31 is the electric field ( fluctuations ) and @xmath32 is the real part of the mode frequency .",
    "ttd determines the strongest collisionless interaction between particles and compressive fast modes in the icm .",
    "the collisionless damping with thermal electrons and protons is @xcite :    @xmath33    where the ratio of magnetic field fluctuations and total energy density is calculated in the collisionless regime in @xcite , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the average over pitch - angles .",
    "the other source of damping of fast modes in the icm is due to ttd interaction with crs @xcite :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the distribution function of cre / p in the momentum space .",
    "the second element that is necessary to constrain @xmath26 is the time - scale of turbulent cascade .",
    "we shall use mhd as a guide and derive the cascading of isotropic fast modes using the kraichnan treatment . in this case the wave - wave diffusion coefficient in k - space is @xcite @xmath39 and the resulting cascading time is :    @xmath40    in eq.[taukk ] and in the following we assume @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the velocity of large - scale eddies .    having derived damping and cascading coefficients , the cut - off scale is obtained requiring @xmath43 :    @xmath44     and that using a kraichnan spectrum .",
    "solid lines assume collisionless interaction with both thermal particles and crs ( case ( i ) in sect.3 ) , dashed lines assume an increased collisionality , with @xmath45 ( to mimic case ( ii ) in sect.3 ) .",

    "this happens when particles collision frequency in the icm is @xmath50 ; for example this is the case where ion - ion collisions in the thermal icm are due to coulomb collisions . under this condition",
    "the damping of compressive modes is dominated by ttd with thermal particles ( eq.[damping_th_lfm_noa ] ) @xcite . for large @xmath51",
    "the dominant damping rate is due to thermal electrons and can be approximated by @xmath52 .",
    "combining pitch - angle averaging of this expression with eq.[kcutk ] gives @xmath53 .",
    "assuming a kraichnan spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations , @xmath54 , the resulting acceleration time - scale ( from eq .",

    "\\(ii ) the other possibility is that thermal particles do not contribute very much to the collisionless dampings .",
    "the icm is a _ weakly collisional _ high - beta plasma that is unstable to several instabilities ( see sect.2 ) .",
    "scattering induced by magnetic field perturbations driven by instabilities may increase the collision frequencies in the thermal plasma because charged particles can be randomized if they interact with the perturbed magnetic field .",
    "this process can be viewed as the collective interaction of an individual ion with the rest of the plasma . under this condition",
    "one may thought that the interaction between modes and thermal particles behave _ collisional_. in this case the dominant collisionless damping in the icm is due to the crs @xcite , and combining eqs.[damping_ur_noa ] and [ kcutk ] :    @xmath60 ^ 2 } } k_o \\label{kcutcr}\\ ] ]    under typical conditions in the icm this is @xmath61 , where the ratio of thermal and cr energy densities is @xmath62 .",

    "efficiently energy from the turbulent cascade , however as the crs energy density increases the acceleration efficiency gets reduced . from the practical point of view",
    "this is simply because crs can get a constant energy flux from turbulence implying that the effect on their spectrum is smaller for increasing values of the crs energy density . as a consequence of this _ back reaction _",
    "fast acceleration can not be maintained for long time .",

    "it has been realised that the existence of these complex collisionless mechanisms , opens new prospects to understand the micro - physics of the icm @xcite .    in this paper we focused on the problem of stochastic acceleration of crs by compressible turbulence in the icm .",

    "depend on the processes of plasma damping and on the way turbulence is generated and transported at smaller scales .",

    "4 ) .    in the case of ttd",
    "we analyzed two extreme situations that differs in the efficiency of collision frequencies between thermal particles in the icm , in particular whether collisions occur via coulomb scattering or mainly via collective processes induced by plasma instabilities . in the latter case collisionless damping of compressive turbulence is dominated by crs and the acceleration is more efficient than in the other case .",
    "we also discussed the changes in the acceleration rate that are induced by different slopes of the turbulent spectrum .    in the case of non - resonant acceleration",
    "we explored the combined effect induced on the acceleration rate by different assumptions for the turbulent spectra and mfp of cre .",
    "the latter parameter is very uncertain but plays a crucial role as it determine the regime of diffusion of cre in the turbulent field and consequently has the potential to strongly change the acceleration efficiency .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the uncertainties about the icm microphysics induce substantial variations in the acceleration efficiency of both mechanisms .",
    "on the other hand however this also implies that radio halos and the non - thermal properties of galaxy clusters are effective probes of the complex microphysics of the icm .",
    "in this paper we do not investigate reacceleration by solenoidal / incompressive turbulence .",
    "several works attempted to model this situation to explain radio halos@xcite .",
    "we note however that these calculations did not take into account the scale - dependent anisotropies in alfvnic turbulence , and consequently addressing the role of alfvnic turbulence in the acceleration process in the icm requires further investigations .    at this point",
    "we believe that future advances in the field will derive from studies that aim at addressing the generation of plasma instabilities in the icm and from attempts to model self - consistently the way these instabilities generate small - scale fluctuations , and affect particles mfp and acceleration rates .",
    "the importance of this step has been clearly highlighted in sect.3 and 4 where we have compared acceleration rates obtained in the collisional and collisionless cases .",
    "situation may be even more complicated because , similarly to the ipm , it can be thought that the collisional properties of the icm may evolve with time and space .",
    "finally we believe that magnetic reconnection in the icm and its interplay with turbulence is another piece of this complex puzzle and it may play a role in the acceleration and reacceleration of cre .",

    "<S> acceleration of cosmic - ray electrons ( cre ) in the intra - cluster - medium ( icm ) is probed by radio observations that detect diffuse , mpc - scale , synchrotron sources in a fraction of galaxy clusters . _ giant radio halos _ are the most spectacular manifestations of non - thermal activity in the icm and are currently explained assuming that turbulence driven during massive cluster - cluster mergers reaccelerates cre at several gev . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario implies a hierarchy of complex mechanisms in the icm that drain energy from large - scales into electromagnetic fluctuations in the plasma and collisionless mechanisms of particle acceleration at much smaller scales . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the physics of acceleration by compressible turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum and damping mechanisms of the electromagnetic fluctuations , and the mean - free - path ( mfp ) of cre are the most relevant ingredients that determine the efficiency of acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> these ingredients in the icm are however poorly known and we show that calculations of turbulent acceleration are also sensitive to these uncertainties . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> this fact implies that the non - thermal properties of galaxy clusters probe the complex microphysics and the _ weakly collisional _ nature of the icm .    </S>",
