    "the detailed study of the abundance patterns of iron - peak , cno and @xmath6 elements in field and globular cluster stellar populations is a fundamental step required to understand the star formation and chemical evolution history of our galaxy .",
    "these elements are synthesized in stars of different masses , hence on different timescales and play a crucial role in disentangling evolutionary mixing effects from primordial enrichment ( wheeler , sneden & truran 1989 , mcwilliam 1997 )    globular clusters represent the best astrophysical templates for the study of the early galactic evolution since they are the oldest objects and their age is well constrained , allowing a reliable calibration of a possible age  metallicity relation ( mcwilliam 1997 ) , a fundamental constraint for any chemical evolution model . in addition , they are equally present in the halo , the thick disk and the bulge of our galaxy ( see e.g. armandroff 1989 , minniti 1995 ) , therefore they represent unique chemical fossils to trace the early epoch of the galaxy formation .",
    "reliable elemental abundances are now available for field stars ( see e.g. boesgaard et al . 1999 ; gratton et al . 2000 , carretta , gratton & sneden 2000 and reference therein ) while are still very incomplete for globular clusters . in halo / disk field",
    "stars the average [ @xmath6/fe ] abundance ratio shows a general enhancement of 0.30.5 dex with respect to the solar value up to [ fe / h]@xmath71 and a linear decreasing trend towards solar [ @xmath6/fe ] with further increasing metallicity .",
    "the actual position of the knee ( i.e. the metallicity at which [ @xmath6/fe ] begins to decrease ) depends on the type  ia sn timescales and it is also a function of the star formation ( sf ) rate , while the amount of @xmath8 enhancement depends on the initial mass function of the progenitors of the type  ii sne ( see mcwilliam 1997 ) .    while the classic halo globular clusters have a mean [ @xmath6/fe]@xmath7 + 0.4 , too few measurements have been done at the high metallicity end to define the trend there ( e.g. kraft 1994 , carney 1996 ) .",
    "bulge globular clusters are ideal targets to study the behavior of the abundance patterns in the high metallicity domain , but foreground extinction is so great as to largely preclude optical studies of any kind , particularly at high spectral resolution .",
    "the most accurate abundance determinations in the galactic bulge obtained so far and based on high resolution optical spectroscopy refer to a sample of k giants in baade s window ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 , hereafter mwr94 ; rich & mcwilliam 2000 ) and a few giants in two globular clusters , ngc  6553 and ngc  6528 ( barbuy et al .",
    "1999 ; cohen et al .",
    "1999 ; carretta et al .",
    "2001 ) .    with the availability of nirspec , a high throughput infrared ( ir ) echelle spectrograph at the keck observatory ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 ) , came the prospect of measuring the composition of the clusters in the bulge .",
    "recently , we observed two bright giants in liller  1 and ngc  6553 with nirspec and our abundance analysis has been presented in origlia , rich & castro ( 2002 , hereafter orc02 ) .",
    "we find @xmath9=-0.3\\pm0.2 $ ] and @xmath10=+0.3\\pm 0.1 $ ] we also measure strong lines for the other @xmath2elements mg , ca , and si , obtaining an overall @xmath1=+0.3\\pm0.2 $ ] dex .",
    "in this paper we present the high resolution ir observations and the abundance analysis for a sample of bright giants in two additional globular clusters , namely terzan  4 and terzan  5 .",
    "these clusters are of special interest because they span the entire abundance range present in the bulge .",
    "these clusters suffer from large foreground extinction ( e(b  v)@xmath112 ) , precluding any optical study at high spectral resolution .",
    "recent hst  nicmos photometry ( ortolani et al . 2001 ) suggests old ages for these clusters and confirms previous photometric estimates for their metallicities ( ortolani , barbuy & bica 1996 , 1997 ) : roughly solar for terzan  5 and as low as 1/100 solar for terzan  4 .",
    "ortolani et al . (",
    "1997 ) argue that a blue horizontal branch is present in terzan  4 , however the small numbers of stars in their color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) requires an independent metallicity measurement in order for the case to be more convincing .",
    "more recent nicmos photometry of terzan  5 ( cohn et al .",
    "2002 ) confirms the presence of an old turnoff point and a cmd consistent with high metallicity .",
    "the recent photometry confirms that both clusters lie within @xmath12 kpc of the galactic center .",
    "our observations and data reduction follow in sect .",
    "3 discusses our abundance analysis and in sect .",
    "4 the resulting metallicities and radial velocities are presented .",
    "our concluding remarks are given in sect .",
    "near infrared , high - resolution echelle spectra of four bright giants in the cores of the bulge globular clusters terzan  4 and terzan  5 have been acquired on 23 june 2001 and 15 july 2002 .",
    "we used the infrared spectrograph nirspec ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 ) which is at the nasmyth focus of the keck  ii telescope . the high resolution echelle mode , with a slit width of @xmath13 ( 3 pixels ) and a length of 24and the standard nirspec-5 setting , which covers most of the 1.51.8 micron h - band , have been selected .",
    "typical exposure times ( on source ) ranged from 4 to 16 minutes .",
    "1 shows the h band images of the observed core region of terzan  4 and terzan  5 taken with the slit viewing camera ( scam ) of nirspec , which has a field of view of 46@xmath1446and a scale of @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "the raw spectra of the observed stars have been reduced using the redspec idl - based package written at the ucla ir laboratory .",
    "each order has been sky subtracted by using nodding pairs and flat - field corrected .",
    "wavelength calibration has been performed using arc lamps and a second order polynomial solution , while telluric features have been removed by dividing by the featureless spectrum of an o star . at the nirspec resolution of r=25,000 several single roto - vibrational oh lines and co bandheads",
    "can be measured to derive accurate oxygen and carbon abundances .",
    "other metal abundances can be derived from the atomic lines of fe  i , mg  i , si  i , ti  i and ca  i. abundance analysis is performed by using full spectral synthesis techniques and equivalent width measurements of representative lines .",
    "we compute suitable synthetic spectra of giant stars by varying the stellar parameters and the element abundances using an updated version of the code described in origlia , moorwood & oliva ( 1993 ) ( see also orc02 ) .",
    "the code uses the lte approximation and is based on the molecular blanketed model atmospheres of johnson , bernat & krupp ( 1980 ) which have been extensively used for abundance studies based on high resolution spectra of cool stars ( e.g. lambert et al .",
    "1984 , smith & lambert 1985 , 1990 ) . for temperatures above 4000  k the code uses the atlas9 models . since in the ir",
    "the major source of continuum opacity is h@xmath17 with its minimum near 1.6 @xmath18 m , the dependence of the results on the choice of model atmospheres is much less critical than in the visual range .",
    "three main compilations of atomic oscillator strengths are used : the kurucz database ( c.f . _",
    "http://cfa-www.harward.edu/amdata/ampdata/kurucz23/sekur.html_ ) , bimont & grevesse ( 1973 ) and melndez & barbuy ( 1999 , hereafter mb99 ) .",
    "on average , mb99 log - gf values are systematically lower than kurucz ones but in most cases the difference does not exceed 0.2  dex and the overall scatter in the derived abundances is @xmath19  dex ( see orc02 for a more quantitative comparison ) .",
    "the molecular oscillator strengths and excitation potentials have been computed as described in origlia et al .",
    "the dissociation energies of the molecules are from table  2 in johnson et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , the reference solar abundances from grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) .",
    "photometric estimates of the stellar parameters are initially used as input to produce a grid of model spectra , allowing the abundances and abundance patterns to vary over a large range and the stellar parameters around the photometric values . the model which better reproduces the overall observed spectrum and the line equivalent widths of selected lines is targetted as the best - fit model .",
    "we measure equivalent widths in the observed spectrum , and in the best fit model and for four models which are , respectively , 0.1 and 0.2 dex away from the best fit .",
    "this approach gives us the uncertainties listed in table 2 .",
    "uncertainties in the stellar parameters of @xmath20200  k in temperature ( t@xmath21 ) , @xmath200.5  dex in log - gravity ( log  g ) and @xmath200.5  km  s@xmath22 in microturbulence velocity ( @xmath23 ) , can introduce a further systematic @xmath240.2  dex uncertainty in the absolute abundances .",
    "however , since the co and oh molecular line profiles are very sensitive to effective temperature , gravity , and microturbulence variations , they constrain better the values of these parameters , significantly reducing their initial range of variation and ensuring a good self - consistency of the overall spectral synthesis procedure ( see orc02 ) . solutions with @xmath25t@xmath26@xmath27200",
    "k , @xmath25log  g=@xmath200.5  dex and @xmath28@xmath290.5  km  s@xmath22 and corresponding @xmath200.2  dex abundance variations from the best - fit one are indeed less statistically significant ( typically at @xmath30 level only , see sect .  4 ) .",
    "moreover , since the stellar features under consideration show a similar trend with variations in the stellar parameters , although with different sensitivities , _ relative _ abundances are less dependent on stellar parameter assumptions and their values can be well constrained down to @xmath310.1  dex .",
    "by combining full spectral synthesis analysis with equivalent width measurements we derive accurate abundances of fe , c , o and [ o / fe ] and @xmath3c/@xmath4c abundance patterns for the four observed giants in terzan  4 and terzan  5 .",
    "the abundances of other @xmath2elements , ca , si , mg and ti , are obtained by measuring a few strong neutral lines .",
    "these lines are generally heavily saturated and are consequently somewhat less sensitive to abundance variations than the molecular co and oh lines , which give a very accurate c and o abundances ( see orc02 ) .    from the nirspec spectra we also derived their heliocentric radial velocities with a @xmath205  km  s@xmath22 uncertainty .",
    "average values of @xmath32  km / s with a dispersion @xmath33  km / s in terzan  4 and of @xmath34  km / s with a dispersion @xmath35  km / s in terzan  5 have been obtained .",
    "the inferred radial velocities are fully consistent with those listed by harris ( 1996;1999 ) , namely 53 and 94  km  s@xmath22 for terzan  4 and terzan  5 , respectively .    table  1 lists the ( v  i)@xmath36 colors , heliocentric radial velocity and the measured equivalent widths of a few representative lines",
    ". table  2 lists the stellar parameters adopted in the spectral synthesis analysis and the derived element abundances for all the program stars .",
    "an overall [ @xmath6/fe ] abundance ratio , as the average of the single [ ca / fe ] , [ si / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] abundance ratios has also been computed .",
    "stellar temperatures are both estimated from colors and molecular lines , gravity from theoretical evolutionary tracks , according to the location of the stars on the red giant branch ( rgb ) , and adopting an average microturbulent velocity 2.0 km / s ( see also origlia et al .",
    "equivalent widths are computed by gaussian fitting the line profiles and the overall uncertainty is @xmath2410% .    given the high reddening and crowding in the core region of these clusters , infrared photometry should be more suitable to infer reliable stellar temperatures and bolometric luminosities .",
    "unfortunately , no j , h , k photometry of the brightest portion of the rgb in the central region of these clusters is currently available .      in order to obtain a first guess estimate of the stellar temperatures , we use the existing @xmath37 photometry of ortolani , barbuy , & bica ( 1997 ) , and we adopt their e(b - v)=2.35 and distance of 8.3 kpc .",
    "we also use the color - temperature transformation and bolometric corrections of montegriffo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , specifically calibrated for globular cluster giants .",
    "we find effective temperatures between 4750 and 5000  k , and @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "ortolani et al . (",
    "1997 ) also suggests an overall metallicity as low as [ fe / h]=2.0 . according to the empirical calibrations of the rgb features by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , at such a low metallicity the rgb tip is expected to be located at m@xmath40 and t@xmath414200  k , that is at a rather lower temperature than the one estimated by the ( v  i)@xmath36 reddening corrected color .",
    "however , one has to take into account that terzan  4 is a relatively low luminosity cluster with high degree of field contamination .",
    "the ( v , v - i ) cmd in the central region of terzan  4 obtained by ortolani , barbuy , & bica 1997 ( see their figure  4 ) and used to estimate the cluster reddening and distance is indeed very sparse and poorly populated . the barely defined rgb and hb sequences can be equally fitted with globular cluster mean ridge lines with quite different metallicities in the range @xmath42\\lesssim -1.0 $ ] , by varying the reddening correction between @xmath43 . moreover , despite the very good seeing , by inspecting the v and i images and by computing point spread function photometry ( as also done by ortolani , barbuy , & bica 1997 ) severe blending is still affecting the stars in the center , particularly star # 2 and # 3 in our sample , whose luminosities are very likely overestimated .    from our overall spectral analysis and in particular by simultaneously best - fitting the molecular line intensity and profiles we find much lower stellar temperatures of @xmath73800 - 4000  k for the observed stars . by adopting these spectroscopic temperatures an overall [ fe / h]@xmath44 and a substantial @xmath6 enhancement by a factor of @xmath73",
    "is obtained ( see table  2 ) .",
    "we also measure a modest carbon depletion ( [ c / fe]=0.25@xmath45  dex ) and low ( @xmath2410 ) @xmath3c/@xmath4c abundance ratios .",
    "2 shows our synthetic best fits superimposed on the observed spectra of the four giants in terzan  4 in three major spectral regions of interest .",
    "3 shows a small portion of the stellar spectra centered on the @xmath3co(6,3 ) bandhead and on a couple of oh molecular lines around 1.62 @xmath18 m , which are very sensitive to the stellar temperature .",
    "superimposed on the observed spectra are two synthetic spectra at [ fe / h]=1.60 adopting both the photometric and spectroscopic estimates of the stellar temperatures .",
    "the warmer spectra are too shallow to account for the observed molecular features since at temperatures significantly above 4000  k molecules barely survive .",
    "the co and in particular the oh molecular bands are indeed extremely sensitive thermometers in cool giants and make it possible to overcome most of the problems and uncertainties with photometric estimates of stellar temperatures in heavely reddened environments .    in order to check further the statistical significance of our best - fit solution , we compute synthetic spectra with @xmath25t@xmath26@xmath27200  k , @xmath25log  g=@xmath200.5  dex and @xmath28@xmath290.5  km  s@xmath22 , and with corresponding simultaneous variations of @xmath200.2  dex of the c and o abundances to reproduce the depth of the molecular features . as a figure of merit we adopt the difference between the model and the observed spectrum ( hereafter @xmath46 ) . in order to quantify systematic discrepancies , this parameter is more powerful than the classical @xmath47 test , which is instead equally sensitive to _ random _ and _ systematic _ scatters ( see also origlia et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "since @xmath46 is expected to follow a gaussian distribution , we compute @xmath48 and the corresponding standard deviation for the best - fit solution and the _ test models _ with the stellar parameter and abundance variations quoted above .",
    "we then extract 10,000 random subsamples from each _ test model _",
    "( assuming a gaussian distribution ) and we compute the probability @xmath49 that a random realization of the data - points around a _ test model _ display a @xmath48 that is compatible with the _ best - fit _ model .",
    "@xmath50 indicates that the model is a good representation of the observed spectrum .",
    "the statistical test has been separately performed on portions of the spectrum mainly containing the co bandheads or the oh lines .",
    "4 shows the average results for the four stars measured in terzan  4 with varying t@xmath26 , log  g and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "as can be appreciated our best fit solution gives in all cases a clear maximum in @xmath49 ( @xmath5199% ) with respect to the _ test models_. oh lines are very efficient in constraining the stellar temperature , while co features are more sensitive to microturbulence : models with @xmath25t@xmath26@xmath27200  k and @xmath28@xmath270.5  km  s@xmath22 , respectively , are only significant at @xmath52 level .",
    "co features and to somewhat less extent the oh lines are also sensitive to gravity : models with @xmath53log  g@xmath270.5  km  s@xmath22 lie at @xmath54 from the best - fit solution .    the cooler stellar temperatures inferred by our spectral analysis , which are also in better agreement with the empirical calibrations of the tip rgb temperatures by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , require a somewhat lower reddening correction , namely e(b ",
    "v)@xmath242.0 , but near infrared photometry would be most valuable to measure better the true reddening and distance of this cluster .    given the large uncertainty affecting the photometric estimate of the stellar temperatures in this cluster and as a further check of the reliability of our overall spectral analysis , we also perform the following experiment .",
    "acceptable fits to the observed h - band spectra have been computed by adopting different temperatures in the range @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding range in variation of the iron abundance turns out to be rather small , between @xmath71.6 and 1.4 , while more dramatic variations of the carbon and oxygen abundances have to be adopted .",
    "figure  5 shows the average [ o / fe ] and [ c / fe ] abundance ratios required to fit the observed spectra . for temperatures above @xmath74500  k , [ c / fe ]",
    "exceeds the solar value , while normally in rgb stars it is somewhat depleted due to the first dredge - up .",
    "more dramatic , for temperatures above @xmath74200  k , [ o / fe ] abundance ratios exceeding 10 times the solar value and up to @xmath7150  at @xmath56  k are needed to fit the relatively deep oh features in the observed spectra ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "this is definitely unlikely . also , large oxygen abunandances are fully inconsistent with the presence of a blue hb , as inferred from the cmd , typical of metal poor clusters ( see also ortolani et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we use the v , i photometry of ortolani , barbuy & bica ( 1996 ) , the distance estimate of 5.6 kpc and e(b  v)=2.39 ( barbuy et al .",
    "1998 ) and the color - temperature transformation of montegriffo et al .",

    "2001 ) , which shows a strong curvature in the optical cmd , terzan  5 should be extremely metal rich , close to solar .",
    "in such a high metallicity regime cool giants near the tip of the rgb suffer dramatic molecular blanketing effects in the v , i photometric bands , making it impossible to estimate reliable bc@xmath57 and bc@xmath58 bolometric corrections .    best - fitting solutions to the observed spectra of the four giants in terzan  5 ( see fig .",
