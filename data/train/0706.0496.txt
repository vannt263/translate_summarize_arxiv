    "moreover , a vertex @xmath8 is _ reachable in @xmath9 _ from a vertex @xmath10 if either @xmath11 or there is a sequence @xmath12 of edges such that @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "of course , reachability in @xmath9 is an equivalence relation .",
    "the equivalence classes are the _ components _ of @xmath9 , and @xmath9 is _ connected _ if there is only one component .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we let @xmath17 be a set of @xmath18 vertices . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath19 is a fixed integer and @xmath20 is sequence , then we let @xmath4 signify a random @xmath0-uniform hypergraph with vertex set @xmath6 in which each of the @xmath21 possible edges is present with probability @xmath22 independently .",
    "we say that @xmath4 enjoys some property @xmath23 _ with high probability _",
    "( w.h.p . )",
    "if the probability that @xmath4 has @xmath23 tends to @xmath24 as @xmath25 . if @xmath26 , then the @xmath4 model is identical with the well - known @xmath27 model of random graphs . in order to state some related results",
    "we will also need a different model @xmath28 of random hypergraphs , where the hypergraph is chosen uniformly at random among all @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs with @xmath18 vertices and @xmath29 edges .",
    "since the pioneering work of erds  and rnyi  @xcite , the component structure of random discrete structures has been a central theme in probabilistic combinatorics . in the present paper , we contribute to this theme by analyzing the maximum order @xmath30 of a component of @xmath1 in greater detail .",
    "more precisely , establishing central and local limit theorems for @xmath30 , we determine the asymptotic distribution of @xmath30 precisely .",
    "though such limit theorems are known in the case of graphs ( i.e , @xmath26 ) , they are new in the case of @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs for @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , to the best of our knowledge none of the arguments known for the graph case extends directly to the case of hypergraphs ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "therefore , we present a new , purely probabilistic proof of the central and local limit theorems , which , in contrast to most prior work , does not rely on involved enumerative techniques .",
    "we believe that this new technique is interesting in its own right and may have further applications .",
    "in their seminal paper  @xcite , erds  and rnyi  proved that the number of vertices in the largest component of @xmath27 undergoes a _ phase transition _ as @xmath32 .",
    "they showed that if @xmath33 for an arbitrarily small @xmath34 that remains fixed as @xmath25 , then all components of @xmath27 consist of @xmath35 vertices .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath36 , then @xmath27 has one _ giant _ component on a linear number @xmath37 of vertices , while all other components contain only @xmath35 vertices .",
    "in fact , in the case @xmath38 erds  and rnyi  estimated the order ( i.e. , the number of vertices ) of the giant component : let @xmath39 signify the maximum order of a component of @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the unique solution to the transcendental equation @xmath42 .",
    "a corresponding result was established by schmidt - pruzan and shamir  @xcite for random hypergraphs @xmath1 .",
    "they showed that a random hypergraph @xmath1 consists of components of order @xmath35 if @xmath43 , whereas @xmath1 has a unique large ( the _ giant _ ) component on @xmath37 vertices w.h.p .  if @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , coja - oghlan , moore , and sanwalani  @xcite established a result similar to  ( [ eqintro1 ] ) , showing that in the case @xmath44 the order of the giant component is @xmath45 w.h.p",
    ". , where @xmath41 is the unique solution to the transcendental equation @xmath46      in terms of limit theorems , ( [ eqintro1 ] ) provides a _ strong law of large numbers _ for @xmath39 , i.e. , it yields the probable value of @xmath39 up to fluctuations of order @xmath47 .",
    "thus , a natural question is whether we can characterize the distribution of @xmath39 ( or @xmath30 ) more precisely ; for instance , is it true that @xmath39 `` converges to the normal distribution '' in some sense ?",
    "our first result , which we will prove in section  [ sec_stein ] , shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "[ thm_nclt ] let @xmath48 be a compact interval , and let @xmath49 be a sequence such that @xmath50 for all @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath51 be the unique solution to  ( [ eqcomv ] ) , and set @xmath52 then @xmath53 converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution .",
    "theorem  [ thm_nclt ] provides a _ central limit theorem _ for @xmath30 ; it shows that for any fixed numbers @xmath54 @xmath55 ( provided that the sequence @xmath56 satisfies the above assumptions ) .    though theorem  [ thm_nclt ] provides quite useful information about the distribution of @xmath30 , the main result of this paper is actually a _ local limit theorem _ for @xmath30 , which characterizes the distribution of @xmath30 even more precisely . to motivate the local limit theorem",
    ", we emphasize that theorem  [ thm_nclt ] only estimates @xmath39 up to an error of @xmath57 .",
    "that is , we do obtain from  ( [ eqintro2 ] ) that for arbitrarily small but fixed @xmath58 @xmath59 i.e. , we can estimate the probability that @xmath30 deviates from some value @xmath60 by at most @xmath61 .",
    "however , it is impossible to derive from  ( [ eqintro2 ] ) or  ( [ eqintro3 ] ) the asymptotic probability that @xmath30 _ hits @xmath60 exactly_.    by contrast , our next theorem shows that for any integer @xmath60 such that @xmath62 we have @xmath63 provided that @xmath64 . note that  ( [ eqintro4 ] ) is exactly what we would obtain from  ( [ eqintro3 ] ) if we were allowed to set @xmath65 in that equation",
    ". stated rigorously , the local limit theorem reads as follows .",
    "[ thm_nlocal ] let @xmath66 be a fixed integer .",

    "let @xmath56 be a sequence such that @xmath50 for all @xmath18 , let @xmath51 be the unique solution to ( [ eqcomv ] ) , and let @xmath70 be as in  ( [ eqsigma ] ) . if @xmath71 and if @xmath60 is an integer such that @xmath72 , then @xmath73      since the work of erds  and rnyi  @xcite , the component structure of @xmath74 has received considerable attention .",
    "stepanov  @xcite provided central and local limit theorems for @xmath75 , thereby proving the @xmath26 case of theorems  [ thm_nclt ] and  [ thm_nlocal ] . in order to establish these limit theorems , he estimates the probability that a random graph @xmath76 is connected up to a factor @xmath77 using recurrence formulas for the number of connected graphs .",
    "furthermore , barraez , boucheron , and fernandez de la vega  @xcite reproved the central limit theorem for @xmath75 via the analogy of breadth first search on a random graph and a galton - watson branching process .",
    "in addition , a local limit theorem for @xmath75 can also be derived using the techniques of van der hofstad and spencer  @xcite , or the enumerative results of either bender , canfield , and mckay  @xcite or pittel and wormald  @xcite .",
    "moreover , pittel  @xcite proved a central limit theorem for the largest component in the @xmath78 model of random graphs ; @xmath78 is just a uniformly distributed graph with exactly @xmath18 vertices and @xmath29 edges .",
    "indeed , pittel actually obtained his central limit theorem via a limit theorem for the joint distribution of the number of isolated trees of a given order , cf .  also janson  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of further results on the components of @xmath76 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of graphs , only little is known for @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs with @xmath31 ; for the methods used for graphs do not extend to hypergraphs directly . using the result  @xcite on the number of sparsely connected hypergraphs , karoski  and uczak  @xcite investigated the phase transition of @xmath1 .",
    "they established ( among other things ) a local limit theorem for @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 which is similar to @xmath1 at the regime @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "these results were extended by andriamampianina , ravelomanana and rijamamy  @xcite to the regime @xmath84 ( @xmath85 respectively ) .    by comparison ,",
    "theorems  [ thm_nclt ] and  [ thm_nlocal ] deal with edge probabilities @xmath22 such that @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 is bounded away from the critical point @xmath88 .",
    "thus , theorems  [ thm_nclt ] and  [ thm_nlocal ] complement  @xcite .",
    "the only prior paper dealing with @xmath86 is that of coja - oghlan , moore , and sanwalani  @xcite , where the authors computed the expectation and the variance of @xmath30 and obtained qualitative results on the component structure of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , in @xcite the authors estimated the probability that @xmath1 or a uniformly distributed @xmath0-uniform hypergraph @xmath28 with @xmath18 vertices and @xmath29 edges is connected up to a constant factor .",
    "while in the present work we build upon the results on the component structure of @xmath1 from  @xcite , the results and techniques of  @xcite by themselves are not strong enough to obtain a central or even a local limit theorem for @xmath30 .",
    "the aforementioned prior work  @xcite on the giant component for random hypergraphs relies on enumerative techniques to a significant extent ; for the basis  @xcite are results on the asymptotic number of connected hypergraphs with a given number of vertices and edges .",
    "by contrast , in the present work we employ neither enumerative techniques nor results , but rely solely on probabilistic methods .",
    "our proof methods are also quite different from stepanov s  @xcite , who first estimates the asymptotic probability that a random graph @xmath27 is connected in order to determine the distribution of @xmath30 . by contrast , in the present work we prove the local limit theorem for @xmath30 directly , thereby obtaining `` en passant '' a new proof for the local limit theorem for random graphs @xmath27 , which may be of independent interest . besides",
    ", the local limit theorem can be used to compute the asymptotic probability that @xmath27 or , more generally , @xmath1 is connected , or to compute the asymptotic number of connected hypergraphs with a given number of vertices and edges ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec_conclusion ] ) .",
    "hence , the general approach taken in the present work is actually converse to the prior ones  @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm_nclt ] makes use of _ stein s method _ , which is a general technique for proving central limit theorems  @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , stein s result implies that a sum of a family of dependent random variables converges to the normal distribution if one can bound the correlations within any constant - sized subfamily sufficiently well .",
    "the method was used by barbour , karoski , and ruciski  @xcite in order to prove that in a random graph @xmath27 , e.g. , the number of tree components of a given ( bounded ) size is asymptotically normal . to establish theorem  [ thm_nclt ]",
    ", we extend their techniques in two ways .    * instead of dealing with the number of vertices in trees of a given size , we apply stein s method to the _ total _ number @xmath89 of vertices outside of the giant component ; this essentially means that we need to sum over all possible ( hyper)tree sizes up to about @xmath90 . *",
    "since we are dealing with hypergraphs rather than graphs , we are facing a somewhat more complex situation than  @xcite , because the fact that an edge may involve an arbitrary number @xmath0 of vertices yields additional dependencies .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the proof of theorem  [ thm_nlocal ] . to establish this result , we think of the edges of @xmath1 as being added in two `` portions '' .",
    "more precisely , we first include each possible edge with probability @xmath91 independently , where @xmath34 is small but independent of @xmath18 ( and denote the resulting random hypergraph by @xmath92 ) ; by theorem  [ thm_nclt ] , the order @xmath93 of the largest component of @xmath92 is asymptotically normal .",
    "then , we add each possible edge that is not present in @xmath92 with a small probability @xmath94 and investigate closely how these additional random edges attach further vertices to the largest component of @xmath92 . denoting the number of these",
    "`` attached '' vertices by @xmath95 , we will show that the conditional distribution of @xmath95 _ given the value of @xmath93 _ satisfies a local limit theorem .",
    "since @xmath96 and @xmath97 are chosen such that each edge is present with probability @xmath22 after the second portion of edges has been added , this yields the desired result on @xmath30 .",
    "the analysis of the conditional distribution of @xmath95 involves proving that @xmath95 is asymptotically normal . to show this , we employ stein s method once more . in addition , in order to show that @xmath95 satisfies a _ local _ limit theorem",
    ", we prove that the number of isolated vertices of @xmath92 that get attached to the largest component of @xmath92 by the second portion of random edges is binomially distributed .",
    "since the binomial distribution satisfies a local limit theorem , we thus obtain a local limit theorem for @xmath95 .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ thm_nlocal ] makes use of some results on the component structure of @xmath1 derived in  @xcite .",
    "for instance , we employ the results on the expectation and the variance of @xmath30 from that paper .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of @xmath95 given in the present work is a considerable extension of the argument used in  @xcite , which by itself would just yield the probability that @xmath95 attains a specific value @xmath98 _ up to a constant factor_.    the main part of the paper is organized as follows . after making some preliminaries in section  [ sec_pre ] ,",
    "we outline the proof of theorem  [ thm_nlocal ] in section  [ sec_nlocal ] . in that section",
    "we explain in detail how @xmath1 is generated in two `` portions '' .",
    "then , in section  [ sec_sss ] we analyze the random variable @xmath95 , assuming the central limit theorem for @xmath95 .",
    "further , section  [ sec_stein ] deals with the proof of theorem  [ thm_nclt ] and the proof of the central limit theorem for @xmath95 via stein s method ; the reason why we defer the proof of theorem  [ thm_nclt ] to section  [ sec_stein ] is that we can use basically the same argument to prove the asymptotic normality of both @xmath30 and @xmath95 .",
    "finally , section  [ sec_conclusion ] contains some concluding remarks , e.g. , on the use of the present results to derive further limit theorems and to solve enumerative problems .",
