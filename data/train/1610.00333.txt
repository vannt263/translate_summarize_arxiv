    "choosing @xmath116 or @xmath117 leads to two different rnca that are mirror images of each other .",
    "in this section we use the characterization of 5-states rnca from lemma  [ lem:5stchar ] to investigate the computational power of such automata .",
    "we show that although they can not be strongly turing universal , they can simulate some logical circuit elements , indicating that they can perform some sorts of computations .",
    "consider a non - trivial 5-states rnca @xmath3 . from lemma  [ lem:5stchar ]",
    "we can assume that @xmath0 with @xmath79 and consider that its flow functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 satisfy the descriptions of the lemma .",
    "we show that starting from a finite configuration @xmath119 , non - quiescent states can not appear arbitrarily far in any direction .",
    "there are two cases to consider , depending on the choice of the quiescent state @xmath21 .",
    "first if @xmath120 , we show that non - quiescent states can not appear outside of the bounding rectangle of the starting configuration @xmath119 ( see figure  [ fig : middlequiescent ] ) .      by induction , if at time @xmath121 all cells outside of the rectangular bounds of @xmath119 are quiescent , then each of these cells has at least 3 neighbors in state @xmath21 . since @xmath122 and @xmath123 , for all @xmath124 , @xmath125 , so @xmath126 and all cells outside of the rectangular bound of @xmath119 remain in state @xmath21 at time @xmath127 .",
    "the second case is when @xmath128 .",
    "assume that @xmath129 and let @xmath130 be the total sum of all the states in @xmath119 ( the argument for @xmath131 is similar but we consider the sum of @xmath132 for all states @xmath133 in @xmath119 ) . since @xmath3 is number conserving , the total sum of all states in subsequent configurations of the automaton remains equal to @xmath130 .",
    "moreover , because all non - quiescent states are positive , the total number of non - quiescent states on any configuration generated from @xmath119 can not exceed @xmath130 .",
    "if quiescent states appear arbitrarily far in one direction in the evolution of @xmath3 from @xmath119 , some cells must go from a non - quiescent state back to the quiescent state @xmath96 in order to keep the total number of non - quiescent states bounded .",
    "we will now assume that the direction in which the non - quiescent states appear arbitrarily far is left ( it is enough to consider one direction since the automaton is rotation - symmetric ) .",
    "assume that @xmath134 and consider the situation illustrated by part ( a ) of figure  [ fig : corners ] : a cell in a non - quiescent state @xmath88 with 4 cells in state 0 around it , 3 on its right side and one under ( for the case @xmath135 we would consider the symmetric situation with a quiescent cell on top of the cell in state @xmath88 instead of under it ) .",
    "let us see how such a cell can change to state @xmath96 .",
    "there are two possibilities , represented by parts ( b ) and ( c ) in figure  [ fig : corners ] .",
    "either @xmath136 and we can use the function @xmath35 to lower the state of the cell to @xmath96 or the contribution of @xmath35 on the cell is 0 and only @xmath68 can lower the state of the cell , in which case only state 1 can be lowered to @xmath96 .",
    "\\(b ) if @xmath136 , then the cell on the right of the cell in state @xmath15 will necessarily change to a positive state .",
    "for this cell , the contribution from @xmath35 will be positive ( at least 1 from the central cell ) and the contribution from @xmath36 will be 0 since @xmath137 for all states @xmath89 .",
    "\\(c ) if @xmath138 , then in order to change the state to @xmath96 , the contribution from @xmath68 must be -1 since @xmath139 for all states @xmath89 .",
    "we have previously chosen to consider the case @xmath134 . if @xmath140 , then the contribution from @xmath36 is 0 and the state of the cell can not change to 0 .",
    "however if @xmath141 , then the contribution from @xmath68 can be @xmath142 only if the top neighbor is in state 4 and the left neighbor is in a state @xmath143 ( as illustrated by figure[fig : corners ] ) . in that case , @xmath144 and the cell changes to state @xmath96 .",
    "however , the cell on the top - right now has a neighbor in state 4 , which means that for this cell the contribution from @xmath35 is at least 1 .",
    "moreover , the contribution from @xmath68 is at least 0 , since @xmath141 and so @xmath145 for all states @xmath146 .",
    "this means that the cell on the top - right of the considered cell changes to a positive state .    we have shown that if a cell in the situation illustrated by part ( a ) of figure  [ fig : corners ] changes its state to 0 , then at least one of the cells from the column right of the considered cell changes from state 0 to a non - quiescent state",
    "this means that as new non - quiescent states appear towards the left , previous non - quiescent states can not be properly removed : in order to remove all non - quiescent states from a given column , it is necessary to create new ones on the column at its right , so as the non - quiescent states move towards the left , new ones appear towards the right .",
    "eventually , the total number of non - quiescent states will be greater than @xmath130 which contradicts number - conservation .",
    "so we know that the evolution @xmath147 of a 5-states rnca @xmath3 from a finite configuration @xmath119 can only have non - quiescent states inside of a bounded area . because there are only finitely many such bounded configurations , eventually the automaton must re - enter a previous configuration .",
    "the evolution of a 5-states rnca from a finite starting configuration is ultimately periodic ( theorem  [ theo : periodic ] ) and therefore decidable . if such ca could simulate a turing machine then the halting problem and all other behavioral problems on turing machines would be decidable .",
    "although the evolution of a 5-states rnca from a finite configuration is ultimately periodic , some non - trivial behaviors can still be observed . in particular , it is possible to simulate some key elements of boolean circuits . in this section",
    ", we consider the 5-states rnca obtained by choosing @xmath148 in the characterization from lemma  [ lem:5stchar ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : widgetwire ] , [ fig : widgetbranch ] and [ fig : widgetspeed ] illustrate how to create a simple wire along which a signal can travel .",
    "the wire is made of two layers of state 2 ( red ) , and the signal is represented by two cells in state 4 ( yellow ) that are `` pushed '' forward by a cell in state 1 ( blue ) . as the signal traverses the wire , the top layer of red states",
    "is changed into blue and green states .",
    "these wires can therefore be traversed only once , which is enough for simple boolean circuit simulation but not for being used as a control circuit for a universal machine .",
    "the wires can be split in two to duplicate a signal ( figure  [ fig : widgetbranch ] ) . by changing the second row of red cell into green states ,",
    "the signal can be accelerated to move by one cell at each time step ( figure  [ fig : widgetspeed ] ) which can be a convenient way to synchronize signals .    as for logical gates , figures  [ fig : widgetand ] and [ fig : widgetnand ] illustrate how to implement an ` and ` and a ` \\overline{a } and b ` gate .",
    "it is known that the ` \\overline{a } and b ` gate alone is sufficient to simulate a ` not ` and an ` or ` gate so these elements would be sufficient for boolean operations @xcite .",
    "note that the boolean value for 0 is simply represented by the absence of a signal .",
    "therefore , careful synchronisation is required when implementing multiple input logical gates as the possible input signals must arrive at the same time ( but this can be done either by using the variable speed wires from figure  [ fig : widgetspeed ] or by artificially increasing the length of a wire with a detour .    however , until now we have been unable to devise a wire crossing pattern which is required for a full simulation of boolean circuits .",
    "because of the destructive nature of signal propagation along a wire , wire crossing might prove impossible to implement .",
