    "this signals the importance of capillary multipoles higher than only a quadrupole , because the point - quadrupole approximation yields the same free energy for both orientations ( see eq .",
    "( [ df22-final ] ) ) .",
    "this discrepancy is not surprising because the longer particle axes ( which set the length scale @xmath122 ) are actually not very small compared with the droplet radius @xmath0 and thus in this case the point - particle limit is a rather crude approximation .",
    "our numerical analysis is restricted to such small droplets due to the limited effectiveness of the finite - element method for larger drops caused by too large numerical errors .",
    "for the same reason we consider only particles with a large aspect ratio ( @xmath221 ) for which the deformation of the interface is sufficiently large so that the numerical noise does not smear out the angular dependence of the free energy . nonetheless , even in this regime our analytic theory captures the main qualitative features of the effective interaction potential between floating ellipsoids .",
    "presumably the reason for this is that even for large particles the droplet shape deviates only slightly from a sphere .",

    "thus even for large particles the deformation of the droplet can be approximated by the superposition of contributions from pointlike quadrupoles substituting the actual particles .",
    "the additional dependence on the orientations revealed by our numerical calculations , which goes beyond the quadrupole approximation , resembles the well established case of a flat interface , which has been analyzed experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite in terms of a multipole expansion .",
    "those studies showed that the point - quadrupole approximation , within which tip - to - tip and side - to - side configurations have the same free energy , is reliable only either for particles with a very small eccentricity ( @xmath247 ) or at large spatial separations @xmath248 .",
    "otherwise , one should rather consider an expansion in terms of elliptic coordinates , from which it follows that the tip - to - tip configuration is energetically more favourable .",
    "this prediction agrees with the experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "our calculations indicate that the same configuration is the preferred one also in the case of spherical interfaces .",
    "however , we have not analyzed all the possible orientations .",
    "it is noteworthy that optimal orientations other then tip - to - tip and side - to - side have been observed at a flat interface for a pair of ellipsoidal particles of _ different _ sizes  @xcite .",
    "we can also discuss the effective capillary potential @xmath249 for a single capillary quadrupole on a _ sessile _ , spherical caplike droplet forming a contact angle @xmath250 with the supporting substrate , where @xmath95 is the angular position of the particle ( @xmath251 ) measured from the droplet symmetry axis and relative to the center of the sphere circumscribing the droplet , and @xmath55 the orientation of the particle .",

    "( [ df22-final ] ) , the dependence of @xmath259 on the orientation @xmath55 drops out so that within this approximation the particle is always attracted to a free contact line and repelled from a pinned one .",
    "thus the effective potential is given by the black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical ] with @xmath260 ( with an additional minus sign in the case of a pinned contact line ) .",
    "in the case of an actual ellipsoidal particle the free energy is no longer given by the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ df22-final ] ) so that the dependence on @xmath55 does no longer drop out but becomes important in the vicinity of the contact line at the substrate . as stated above , if this contact line is _ free _ ( still assuming @xmath253 ) , due to symmetry arguments the free energy of a single particle on a sessile drop equals one half of the energy for two particles on a full droplet ( as predicted by the method of images for the more restrictive case of pointlike quadrupoles ) , for which the full numerical results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical ] .",
    "accordingly , for a fixed angular position @xmath261 of the particle its orientation perpendicular to the contact line ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : numerical ] ) is energetically more favorable .",
    "however , the global minimum of the free energy corresponds to the particle touching the substrate ( i.e. , @xmath262 so that @xmath204 ) and being oriented parallel to the contact line ( dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : numerical ] for @xmath263 ) .",
    "however , we can not judge if the latter configuration remains the optimal one for arbitrary aspect ratios and contact angles at the particle .",
    "( this and analyzing the influence of the contact angle at the substrate actually call for a separate numerical study . )",
    "if the contact line at the substrate is _ pinned _ , the global free energy minimum corresponds to the particle being positioned at the drop apex . in such a case , due to a large distance from the contact line with the substrate , the pointlike quadrupole approximation remains reliable .",
    "one can estimate the depth of this effective confining potential as follows . according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dfell ] ) and ( [ df22-final ] ) with @xmath227 and assuming @xmath264 ( which applies to an ellipsoidal particle of aspect ratio @xmath221 and contact angle @xmath222 , see the caption of fig .  [",

    "hence , one could experimentally measure the capillary confining potential , e.g. , by observing the brownian motion of micron - sized particles on sessile drops . finally , we emphasize that the effects of confinement should be also taken into account in determining the effective _ pair _ potentials between particles on _ sessile _ drops ( for the case of monopoles see ref .",
