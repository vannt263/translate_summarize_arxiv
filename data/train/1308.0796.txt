    "it is well - known that both the complex and the real representation ring of any compact lie group are @xmath0-rings - ring , we mean a `` special @xmath0-ring''see the paragraph on terminology below . ]",
    "similarly , for any affine algebraic group scheme @xmath1 over a field , with representation category @xmath2 , the exterior power operations endow the representation ring @xmath3 with the structure of a @xmath0-ring .",
    "indeed , this is a direct consequence of serre s beautiful 1968 paper `` groupes de grothendieck des schmas en groupes rductifs dploys '' @xcite , in which serre shows that the representation ring of a split reductive group over an arbitrary field can be computed in the same way as  and is in fact isomorphic to  the representation ring of the corresponding group over @xmath4 .",
    "according to serre s introduction , establishing the @xmath0-ring structure was in fact one of his motivations for writing his article .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to complete the picture by establishing the @xmath0-ring structure on the `` symmetric representation ring '' @xmath5 , generated by isotropy classes of representations equipped with equivariant non - degenerate symmetric forms .",
    "this ring @xmath5 is to the usual representation ring @xmath6 what the real representation ring is to the complex representation ring in topology .",
    "see for precise definitions .",
    "we will show :    for any affine algebraic group scheme @xmath1 over a field of characteristic not two , the exterior power operations induce a @xmath0-ring structure on the symmetric representation ring @xmath5 .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this fundamental structure on @xmath5 has not been exposed before , except in the case when @xmath1 is the trivial group : the @xmath0-ring structure on the grothendieck - witt ring of a field has been studied by mcgarraghy @xcite .    [ [ lambda - terminology . ] ] @xmath0-terminology .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there are at least two problems with the term `` @xmath0-ring '' .",
    "firstly , the term is ambiguous : while grothendieck originally distinguished between @xmath7 in this article , we follow berthelot .",
    "this seems to be the current trend , and it has the merit that the shorter term is reserved for the more natural object . in any case , the bulk of this article is devoted to proving that we have a structure of type  ( 2 ) , not just of type  ( 1 ) .",
    "secondly , the term `` @xmath0-ring '' is misleading in that it puts undue emphasis on @xmath0-operations / exterior powers .",
    "for example , from a purely algebraic perspective , the symmetric powers have just as good a claim to the title as the exterior powers .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a beautiful coordinate - free definition of @xmath0-rings as `` rings equipped with all possible symmetric operations '' in a precise sense .",
    "suffice it to remark here that the existence of a @xmath0-structure on a ring includes the existence of many other natural operations such as symmetric powers and adams operations .",
    "that said , we will nevertheless work with the traditional definition in terms of exterior powers below .",
    "one technical reason for this is that exterior powers behave well under dualization : the dual of the exterior power of a representation is the exterior power of the dual representation , in any characteristic .",
    "the same is not true of symmetric operations .",
    "thus , in this case the existence of well - defined symmetric powers on @xmath5 follows only _ a posteriori _ from the existence of a @xmath0-structure .",

    "we recall some definitions and facts concerning symmetric representations , including a discussion of the additive structure of @xmath5 following calms and hornbostel s preprint @xcite .    our proof in that the exterior powers induce well - defined maps on @xmath5 follows a similar pattern as the usual argument for @xmath6 , using in addition only the well - known technique of `` sub - lagrangian reduction '' .",
    "when the ground field is algebraically closed , the fact that the resulting pre-@xmath0-structure on @xmath5 is a @xmath0-structure can easily be deduced in the same way as in topology : in this case , the forgetful map @xmath8 exhibits @xmath5 as a sub-@xmath0-ring of the @xmath0-ring @xmath6",
    ". however , over general fields this argument breaks down .",
    "is devoted to mending it : we reduce to the `` universal case '' , the case when @xmath1 is a product of split orthogonal groups , show that the symmetric representation ring of such @xmath1 embeds into the symmetric representation ring of an extension of a maximal split torus , and verify that the latter is a @xmath0-ring by a direct calculation .",
    "the implications of the universal case are in fact not restricted to representation rings .",
    "the main application we have in mind is to the grothendieck - witt ring of vector bundles on a scheme , in the same way that serre s result is applied to the @xmath9-ring of vector bundles in @xcite*expos  vi , theorem  3.3 .",
