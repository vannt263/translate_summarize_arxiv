    "recently @xcite , there has been considerable interest in renormalization procedure in classical electrodynamics of a point particle moving in flat space - time of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the main task is to derive the analogue of the well - known lorentz - dirac equation @xcite .",
    "following scheme proposed by dirac in his classical paper @xcite , galtsov in @xcite decomposes three vector potential of a point - like charge @xmath0 . the first term , @xmath1 , is the half - sum of the retarded , @xmath2 , and the advanced , @xmath3 , solutions of the dalembert equation with point - like source .",
    "since @xmath1 is singular in the immediate vicinity of the world line , the subscript `` s '' stands for `` singular '' as well as `` symmetric '' . because @xmath1 is just singular as @xmath2 ,",
    "removing it from the retarded solution gives the potential @xmath4 that well behaves near the world line .",
    "since @xmath5 satisfies the homogeneous wave equation , it can be interpreted as a free radiation field .",
    "hence the subscript `` r '' stands for `` regular '' as well as `` radiative '' .    in classical electrodynamics of a point - like charge arbitrarily moving in flat space - time of four dimensions",
    "the singular part gives a divergent self - energy while the regular one leads to standard radiation reaction force .",
    "the unphysical `` bare '' mass involved in action integral absorbs the divergent self - energy of a point charge within the renormalization procedure and then becomes the observable finite rest mass of the particle @xcite . in six dimensions",
    "the coulomb potential of a charge scales as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "inevitable infinities arising in higher - dimensional electrodynamics are stronger than in four dimensions .",
    "for this reason galtsov @xcite claims , that `` in even dimensions higher than four , divergences can not be removed by the mass renormalization '' .    to make classical electrodynamics in six dimensions a renormalizable theory , in @xcite the six - dimensional analogue of the relativistic particle with rigidity @xcite",
    "is substituted for the structureless point charge whose lagrangian is proportional to worldline length .",
    "new lagrangian involves , apart from usual `` bare mass '' , an additional regularization constant which absorbs one extra divergent term . in @xcite the procedure of regularization in any dimensions is elaborated by using of functional analysis . to get a renormalizable theory for even dimension @xmath7 , the original lagrangian for free relativistic particle with `` bare '' mass is modified by introducing @xmath8 extra ( higher derivative ) terms .",
    "so , in six dimensions the whole renormalization procedure involves two arbitrary constants . since there is three types of divergences in six dimensions , galtsov doubts whether `` all divergences arising in higher - dimensional electrodynamics can be absorbed in this way '' @xcite .",
    "introduction of higher derivatives in the particle action term seems for him not reasonable enough since it `` drastically changes the initial theory '' .",
    "contrary to @xcite where the authors deal with equations of motion , kosyakov @xcite calculates the flux of energy - momentum and derive the radiation - reaction force by adding of appropriate schott term . in the present paper",
    "we consider also the conserved quantities corresponding to the invariance of the theory under proper homogeneous lorentz transformations .",
    "they gives an additional information which clarifies the essence of renormalization procedure .",
    "in such a way we reformulate the problem of renormalizability within the problem of poincar invariance of a closed particle plus field system .",
    "the conservation laws are an immovable fulcrum about which tips the balance of truth regarding renormalization and radiation reaction . either nonrenormalizable theory or renormalizable one should be compatible with the poincar symmetry .",
    "the standard variational principle is formulated @xcite for a composite system of point - like charged particle and its own electromagnetic field : @xmath9 here @xmath10 and the interaction term given by @xmath11 the particle s world line @xmath12 is described by the functions @xmath13 which give the particle s coordinates as function of proper time @xmath14 ; @xmath15 . by @xmath16",
    "we denote the area of a @xmath17-dimensional sphere of unit radius : @xmath18    the action ( [ itot ] ) is invariant under infinitesimal transformation ( translations and rotations ) which constitute the poincar group . according to noether s theorem ,",
    "these symmetry properties can be used for the derivation of conservation laws , i.e. those quantities that do not change with time .",
    "strictly speaking , the action integral ( [ itot ] ) may be used to derive trajectories of the test particles , when the field is given _",
    "a priory_. it may also be used to derive @xmath19dimensional maxwell equations , if the particle trajectories are given _",
    "a priory_. simultaneous variation with respect to both field and particle variables is incompatible since the lorentz force will always be ill defined in the immediate vicinity of the particle s world line .",
    "our consideration is founded on the field ( [ if ] ) and the interaction ( [ ia ] ) terms of the action ( [ itot ] ) .",
    "they constitute the action functional which governs the propagation of the electromagnetic field produced by a moving charge ( i.e. the maxwell equations with point - like source ) : @xmath20 linard - wiechert fields are the solutions of maxwell equations with point - like sources .",
    "these `` fields '' do not have degrees of their own : they are functionals of particle paths .",
    "one can substitute these _ direct particle fields _ @xcite in the conservation laws to rewrite them in terms of particle variables .",
    "the components of energy - momentum carried by the electromagnetic field are @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the vectorial surface element on an arbitrary space - like hypersurface @xmath23 .",
    "the components of the electromagnetic field s stress - energy tensor @xmath24 have a singularity on a particle trajectory . in eq.([pem ] ) capital letter @xmath25 denotes the principal value of the singular integral , defined by removing from @xmath23 an @xmath26-sphere around the particle and then passing to the limit @xmath27 .",
    "the angular momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field is written as @xcite @xmath28    conservation of the space part @xmath29 of the tensor @xmath30 is due to invariance under space rotations .",
    "conservation of the mixed space - time components , @xmath31 , takes place due to invariance under lorentz transformations .",
    "using the retarded green function ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.(3.4 ) ) associated with the dalembert operator @xmath32 and the charge - current density vector @xmath33 we construct the retarded linard - wiechert potential in even dimensions : @xmath34    an appropriate coordinate system for flat space - time is a very important for the volume integration ( [ pem ] ) and ( [ mem ] ) .",
    "we calculate how much electromagnetic field momentum and angular momentum flow across a world tube of constant radius @xmath35 enclosing the world line @xmath36 ( bhabha tube @xcite , see fig.[tube ] ) .",
    "a world tube is a disjoint union of ( retarded ) spheres of constant radii @xmath35 centered on a world line @xmath12 of the particle .",
    "the sphere @xmath37 is the intersection of future light cone , generated by null rays emanating from @xmath38 in all possible directions , @xmath39 and tilted hyperplane @xmath40 : @xmath41 points on a sphere are distinguished by spherical polar angles involved in the space components @xmath42 of the null vector @xmath43 , namely @xmath44 in four dimensions , or @xmath45@xmath46 in six dimensions .",
    "to understand the situation more thoroughly , we pass to particle s momentarily comoving lorentz frame ( mclf ) where the particle is momentarily at the rest at the retarded instant @xmath47 ( see fig.[cone ] ) .",
    "the charge is placed in the coordinate origin ; the sphere @xmath48 is the intersection of the future light cone with vertex at the origin and hyperplane @xmath49 .    as usual",
    ", we call a _ retarded distance _ the distance @xmath35 between any point on spherical light front @xmath48 and the particle , taken in mclf . in the laboratory",
    "frame the points on this sphere have the following coordinates : @xmath50 the flat space - time @xmath51 becomes a disjoint union of world tubes @xmath52 enclosing the particle trajectory .",
    "it is straightforward to substitute the components @xmath53 into eq.([t ] ) to calculate the electromagnetic field s stress - energy tensor .",
    "direct calculations shows @xcite that either energy - momentum ( [ pem ] ) or angular momentum ( [ mem ] ) carried by the retarded linard - wiechert field contains two quite different parts : ( i ) the bound part which is permanently `` attached '' to the charge and is carried along with it ; ( ii ) the radiation part detaches itself from the charge and leads an independent existence .",
    "the former is divergent while the latter is finite .",
    "the bound parts depend on the state of particle s motion at the vicinity of the observation time only while the radiative parts are accumulated with time ( see fig.[noe ] ) . within regularization procedure the bound terms",
    "are coupled with energy - momentum and angular momentum of `` bare '' sources , so that already renormalized characteristics @xmath54 of charged particles are proclaimed to be finite .",
    "noether quantities which are properly conserved become : @xmath55    on rearrangement , the total four - momentum of our composite particle plus field system looks as follows : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is @xmath58-th component of the particle acceleration .",
    "similarly , the total angular momentum is @xmath59 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac23e^2\\int_{-\\infty}^\\tau du   \\left[u^\\mu(u)a^\\nu(u)-u^\\nu(u)a^\\mu(u)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dot denotes the scalar product .",
    "particle four - momentum @xmath60 is already renormalized .",
    "time differentiation of these conserved quantities gives the system of ten equations in four variables @xmath61 and their time derivatives @xcite .",
    "having differentiated ( [ mtot ] ) and taking into account the differential consequence of eq.([ptot ] ) @xmath62 we arrive at the equality which explains how four - momentum of charged particle depends on its velocity and acceleration : @xmath63 ( the symbol @xmath64 denotes the wedge product . ) hence the particle four - momentum contains , apart from the usual velocity term , also a contribution from the acceleration when the particle is charged : @xmath65 since @xmath66 , the scalar product of particle four - velocity on the first - order time - derivative of particle four - momentum ( [ dptot ] ) is as follows : @xmath67 similarly , the scalar product of particle acceleration on the particle four - momentum ( [ texp ] ) is given by @xmath68 summing up ( [ pdp ] ) and ( [ pp ] ) we obtain @xmath69 therefore , @xmath70 is already renormalized rest mass of the particle @xcite .",
    "we are sure that the well - known teitelboim s expression ( [ texp ] ) for the four - momentum of point - like charged particle @xcite as well as the lorentz - dirac equation @xcite arise from the total energy - momentum and angular momentum balance equations .",

    "the divergences are absorbed by individual particle s six - momentum within the renormalization procedure based on the noether quantities ( see fig.[noe ] and eq.([noether ] ) ) .",
    "the total energy - momentum of a closed system of an arbitrarily moving charge and its electromagnetic field is equal to the sum @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the radiative part of electromagnetic field s energy - momentum which does not depend on @xmath35 at all : @xmath102 ( we denote @xmath103 the derivative @xmath104 . )    volume integration of the angular momentum tensor density shows , that the bound angular momentum depends on the state of particle s motion at the observation instant only : @xmath105 by symbol @xmath106 we mean the expression in between the squared brackets of eq.([pbnd ] ) .",

    "our next task is to derive expressions which explains how six - momentum and angular momentum of charged particle depend on its velocity and acceleration etc .",
    "having performed the time differentiation of eq.([pmn ] ) we obtain the following energy - momentum balance equation : @xmath115 ( all the particle characteristics are evaluated at the instant of observation @xmath14 . )",

    "having substituted the right - hand side of eq.([p_ost ] ) for the particle s six - momentum in the energy - momentum balance equation ( [ pdot ] ) , we derive the lorentz - dirac equation of motion of a charged particle under the influence of its own electromagnetic field .",

    "the _ bound _ momentum differs from one of the particle being `` dressed '' in electromagnetic `` fur '' ( see eq.(42 ) in e - print version of @xcite ) .",

    "it is sufficient to assume that a charged particle possesses its own ( already renormalized ) six - momentum @xmath126 which is transformed as an usual six - vector under the poincar group .",

    "we examine whether the renormalizabolity is a necessary condition for consistency of the local field theory with fundamental principles such as energy - momentum conservation and the conservation of total angular momentum . a careful analysis with the use of regularization procedure compatible with the poincar symmetry shows , that the usual particle part of initial action integral ( [ itot ] ) which is proportional to the worldline lenght is inconsistent with @xmath136 and @xmath137 in six dimensions .",
    "indeed , the angular momentum tensor of structureless particle @xmath138 corresponds to @xmath139 given by ( [ if ] ) .",
    "having analyzed angular momentum balance equations one has again @xmath140 instead of ( [ mdot ] ) .",
    "its solution is a motion with constant velocity where @xmath141 do not change .",
    "hence the action functional based on the higher - derivative lagrangian for a `` rigid '' relativistic particle @xcite should be substituted for @xmath142 in ( [ if ] ) .",
    "it involves two renormalization constants @xcite ; it is sufficient to renormalize _ all _ the divergences arising in six - dimensional electrodynamics .",
    "nonrenormalizable theory contradicts the differential consequences of the conserved quantities which arise from the invariance of the system under space rotations and lorentz transformations .",
    "volume integration of energy - momentum and angular momentum carried by electromagnetic field shows , that a charged particle is supplemented with the bound electromagnetic `` cloud '' which has its own ( divergent ) momentum and angular momentum .",
    "corresponding characteristics of `` bare '' charge absorb them within the regularization procedure based on noether conservation laws ( see figure [ noe ] ) .",
    "the radiative parts of the electromagnetic field s energy - momentum and angular momentum detach the charge and lead an independent existence .",
    "they are involved in energy - momentum and angular momentum balance equations which determine how _ already renormalized _ particle s momentum and angular momentum depend on its velocity , acceleration etc ( see eq.([texp ] ) for @xmath135 and eq.([p_ost ] ) for @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in six dimensions a test particle ( i.e. point charge which itself does not influence the field ) is the rigid particle .",
    "its momentum is given by the expression ( [ p_ost ] ) where @xmath143 tends to zero ; it is not parallel to six - velocity .",
