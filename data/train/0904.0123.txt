    "the last decades have seen tremendous interest in exotic phases of correlated quantum matter characterized by elementary excitations with fractional quantum numbers .",
    "some examples are luttinger liquids,@xcite spin liquids,@xcite and fractional quantum hall systems.@xcite while it has long been known that fractionalization generically occurs in one space dimension ( 1d ) , the situation in higher dimensions @xmath0 is quite different .",
    "it has become clear that fractionalized phases in @xmath1 can be connected to deconfined phases of certain lattice gauge theories.@xcite    quantum antiferromagnets have played a central role in investigations of exotic phases.@xcite such systems can exhibit both antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic ground states . in the latter situation , which is generic to 1d due to the mermin - wagner theorem ,",
    "quantum fluctuations prevent long - range order of the spins . in @xmath1 ,",
    "quantum paramagnetic states may obtained by the formation of singlet bonds of spins 1/2 . for lattices with one spin 1/2 per unit cell ,",
    "the singlet bonds can form either crystalline order accompanied by lattice symmetry breaking , leading to so - called valence bond solid ( vbs ) phases , or short - range ordered liquid states without any broken symmetry.@xcite remarkably , such spin liquids can be shown to be fractionalized , with elementary excitations being spin-1/2 spinons .",
    "the search for microscopic realizations of spin liquids in @xmath2 remains difficult , because the relevant spin models display geometric frustration : this reduces the applicability of otherwise powerful quantum monte carlo techniques due to the so - called sign problem . the first unambiguous demonstration of a stable phase with fractionalization in two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnet was for the triangular - lattice quantum dimer model , which features both vbs and gapped spin liquid phases , the latter displaying topological order.@xcite models with exact gapped spin - liquid ground states have been constructed , like the toric code model@xcite and the spin-1/2 honeycomb model,@xcite both due to kitaev .",
    "heisenberg models with longer - range frustrated interactions are believed to be good candidates for topological spin liquids as well , but with the exception of the triangular - lattice ring - exchange model@xcite no conclusive numerical results are available .",
    "( gapless spin liquids with power - law correlation functions do not play a role in the subsequent discussion . )    a special form of fractionalization has been argued to be possible at a continuous quantum phase transition between two conventional phases with different broken symmetries.@xcite a candidate for this scenario of deconfined quantum criticality is the nel ",
    "vbs transition of the square - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet supplemented by a ring - exchange interaction.@xcite an interesting prediction of the deconfined critical theory is the existence of two distinct small energy scales on the vbs side of the quantum critical point : primarily , the transition is between a nel state and a spin liquid , and the vbs is a secondary instability of the spin liquid .",
    "consequently , dimerization and confinement set in at a much smaller energy scale compared to paramagnetic behavior .",
    "a common feature of ( i ) a confined paramagnet near a confinement  deconfinement transition and ( ii ) a vbs phase near a deconfined critical point is that , in addition to the magnetic correlation length @xmath3 , there exists a much larger length scale associated with confinement , which we dub confinement length @xmath4 . in the following",
    ", we shall understand @xmath4 as the typical spatial extension of a two - spinon bound state .",
    "importantly , both @xmath4 and @xmath3 can be large compared to microscopic lengths , opening the possibility to find universal phenomena characterized by two length scales , in contrast to the conventional situation with @xmath3 being the only large length . indeed , a recent numerical study @xcite of the frustrated regime of the @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice gave evidence for two distinct length scales , with @xmath8 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is a detailed discussion of physical properties of quantum paramagnets near deconfinement .",
    "we believe this regime to be relevant for a rather broad class of frustrated magnets : even if the elementary excitations are ultimately confined , there will be signatures of deconfinement on shorter length scales , which can be probed experimentally .",
    "the presence of two length scales , @xmath4 and @xmath3 , strongly modifies a number of phenomena , both in statics and dynamics .",
    "we present general arguments and support them by explicit calculations for 1d heisenberg models .",
    "although the mechanisms of fractionalization are quite different in 1d and higher dimensions , we argue that various consequences for observables are similar , and hence our results remain qualitatively valid in @xmath2 as well .      in the simplest picture ,",
    "weak confinement can be understood in terms of a ( weak ) linear potential , @xmath9 , describing the effective interaction between two spinons .",
    "the two - particle problem then has only bound - state solutions , i.e. , all excitations are of two - spinon type .",
    "the lowest two - spinon triplet state takes the role of the conventional spin-1 ( triplon ) excitation , its size defining the confinement length @xmath4 , with @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "a static measurement of @xmath4 is possible , e.g. , by spatial pinning of one of the two partners of the bound state .",
    "this can be achieved by doping with non - magnetic impurities : removing one spin-1/2 from the system breaks a singlet and liberates a spinon which now interacts with the vacancy ( holon ) .",
    "provided that the binding between spinon and holon is identical to that between two spinons , the size of the spinon  holon bound state gives a measure of @xmath4 . as we show below",
    ", the size of the antiferromagnetic polarization cloud around the vacancy is given by @xmath4 in the weakly confined regime ( whereas it is determined by @xmath3 in the conventional case of strong confinement ) .",
    "this polarization cloud , which can be detected e.g. by local magnetic probes , also determines the effective magnetic interaction between impurity moments and is hence relevant for impurity - induced magnetic order .",
    "weak confinement shows up as well in the dynamical properties , as it implies the existence of multiple bound states below the two- or three - triplon continuum .",
    "hence , inelastic neutron scattering experiments , measuring the dynamic spin susceptibility , will detect a series of sharp dispersing modes below the threshold of the multi - particle continuum .    with increasing confinement potential , @xmath4 decreases .",
    "the criterion for the crossover to strong confinement may be defined as @xmath12 .",
    "this is expected to coincide with the condition that the energy spacing between the lowest two - spinon bound states becomes comparable to the spin gap , and hence the higher bound states are no longer discernible in the dynamical susceptibility .",

    "the solutions of the effective schrdinger equation , which describes the two - spinon bound states _ above _ the spin - gap @xmath72 , also have the form .",

    "the _ ansatz _ follows from a careful analysis of the analytical solutions of the one - dimensional problem .",
    "indeed , we applied the above procedure for the @xmath291 case , compared the results with the analytical solution reported in ref .   and verified that it provides good estimates for the energy of the lowest two - spinon bound states .    for @xmath266 and @xmath267 , we find again @xmath271 and that the energies of the first ( @xmath287 ) , second ( @xmath292 ) and third ( @xmath293 ) lowest bound states are given by @xmath294 with @xmath295 , @xmath296 , and @xmath297 .",
    "according to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ dynamics1 ] , the strong  weak confinement crossover occurs when @xmath298 .",
    "similar considerations hold for @xmath198 .",
    "the above analysis suggests many parallels between 1d and higher dimensions , but falls short of capturing short - distance features of the bound states as well as effects of non - trivial statistics of the spinons .",
    "the preceding discussion of confinement has been simplistic in that it assumed that the presence or absence of long - distance ( asymptotic ) confinement also determines the nature of the low - energy excitations .",
    "while this is the case for the one - dimensional @xmath5@xmath6@xmath13 spin chain , which features a confinement potential of the type @xmath9 for all length scales , this is obviously not true in general .",
    "while the long - distance behavior of the effective interaction , mediated by the gauge field , decides about asymptotic confinement or deconfinement , it is its short - distance behavior which determines the existence and spatial size of possible bound states at low energies .    in other words , it is conceivable that a phase in @xmath1 spatial dimensions with asymptotic deconfinement of spinons and associated topological order displays short - distance spinon bound states.@xcite in such a situation , the diagnostics proposed in this paper , i.e. , an vacancy - induced magnetic moment with cloud size @xmath4 and multiple sharp modes in @xmath176 below the continuum , will signal ( weak ) confinement , whereas the true nature of the phase is deconfined .",
    "obviously , distinguishing such a deconfined phase with bound states from a confined phase is extremely difficult .",
    "( numerically , topological ground - state degeneracies may be used to detect deconfinement . )    to our knowledge , no explicit microscopic examples for fractionalized spin liquids with spinon bound states existing below the continuum are known to date,@xcite which is also related to the difficulties in numerically studying the excitation spectra of the relevant microscopic models .",
    "possible candidates are states with @xmath299 fractionalization which are believed to generically display a non - zero spinon pairing amplitude.@xcite it should be kept in mind that the bound states in question , which are determined by short - range physics , are not necessarily part of effective low - energy gauge - field descriptions .",
    "it is worth noting that a spinless impurity in the vbs phase near a deconfined critical point has been shown@xcite to bind a spinon on a length scale much shorter than the vbs ( or confinement ) length .",
    "in this paper , we have argued that quantum paramagnets , in particular those with frustration , can display an interesting regime of weak confinement of spinons . here , the long - distance properties are conventional , with elementary excitations being spin-1 triplons ; however , the physics of spinons is visible at shorter length scales .",
    "such weakly confined paramagnets are characterized by two potentially large length scales , namely the common magnetic correlation length @xmath3 and a confinement length @xmath4 , which measures the typical distance between weakly bound spinons .",
    "weak confinement implies @xmath47 ; the crossover to strong confinement occurs at @xmath300 .",
    "we have illustrated the physics of the weakly confined regime with explicit calculations for frustrated dimerized spin chains , where weak confinement can be realized for weak explicit dimerization on top of strong spontaneous dimerization .",
    "in particular , we have studied the static response of the system to nonmagnetic impurities : the staggered polarization cloud induced by the impurity decays on a length scale given by @xmath301 .",
    "we have also briefly discussed the structure of the dynamic susceptibility in the clean case and the effective interaction between impurity - induced moments .",
    "qualitatively , our results remain valid in higher dimensions as well : in @xmath1 , weak confinement is reached near a confinement  deconfinement transition , e.g. , between a gapped spin liquid and a valence - bond solid , or near a deconfined quantum critical point between a nel and a vbs phase .",
    "however , a caveat in @xmath1 is that long - distance confinement ( deconfinement ) of spinons is not necessarily equivalent to the presence ( absence ) of short - distance spinon bound states : in principle , bound states forming conventional triplon excitations can exist even in deconfined spin liquids .",
    "this tantalizing scenario is left for future investigations .",
    "last not least , upon inclusion of mobile charge carriers , weak confinement can be expected to lead to an almost spin ",
    "charge separated metallic state .",
    "this may be a conventional fermi liquid , but with small quasiparticle weights and strong incoherent continua in spectral functions : the carriers will get dressed by a large cloud of _ singlet _ excitations , in analogy to the dressing with _ triplet _ excitations near a magnetic quantum critical point.@xcite    we thank r. moessner , a. rosch , s. sachdev , u. schollwck , t. senthil , and g. japaridze for discussions and s. trebst for suggestions .",
