    "a great success of observational cosmology of the last decade has allowed to go from a purely theoretical investigation of possible cosmological models to testing them and constraining their parameters .",
    "currently , the total number of model parameters exceeds ten , they can be separated in few groups :    * the parameters related to the geometry of the universe ",
    "@xmath24 , hubble parameter @xmath25 , and three - dimensional curvature @xmath26 . * the parameters related to the nature and abundance of matter ( including dark matter and baryons ) in the universe and the value of cosmological constant ( @xmath0-term ) , called often as `` the dark energy '' .",
    "they are the matter density parameters in the universe @xmath27 ( the sum of @xmath28 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , the number of massive species of neutrinos @xmath29 , the energy density of @xmath0-term @xmath30 , and other parameters of the dark energy ( e.g. quintessence , its equation of state @xmath31 , etc ) . * the group of parameters related to the inflationary stage of the universe , which describes the power spectra of metric perturbations generated . in the simplest version of inflation based on the theory of scalar field",
    "these parameters are the amplitudes and the slopes of density perturbation and gravitational wave spectra .",
    "a complete analysis of the cosmological model in constraining all mentioned above parameters ( assumed initially as free ones ) is currently a difficult task since it requires as excellent technical facilities as a special study of different sets of observational data for their completeness and independence . in view of the imperfection of currently available",
    "observational data one usually assumes a simplified model with restricted number of the parameters ( and fixed others ) and test it by a selected set of observational data .",
    "the goal of the present analysis is to consider a matter - dominated model of the universe and constrain its parameters by three fundamental tests which have different characteristic scales .",
    "these observational tests are the large scale cmb anisotropy ( @xmath32 ) , the amplitude of the first acoustic peak of sakharov oscillations ( @xmath33 ) and the mass function of clusters of galaxies ( @xmath34 ) . _",
    "the aim of the analysis is to clarify the modern status of such a model : whether it can explain the observations or not , and thus , whether the @xmath0cdm is the only satisfactory model . _    to answer this question we considered a family of matter - dominated cosmological models with the following free parameters :    * @xmath35 $ ] , ( 15 models with step 0.01 ) ; * @xmath36 $ ] , ( 7 models with step 0.1 ) ; * @xmath37 $ ] , ( 5 models with step 0.1 ) ; * @xmath38 $ ] , ( 6 models with step 0.02 ) ; * @xmath39 $ ] , ( 6 models with step 0.05 ) .",
    "altogether we had 18900 variants of the model .",
    "the broad intervals for parameter variations are specially selected to find all possible solutions for the given tests .",
    "the first parameter , @xmath1 , is a more accurate normalisation of density perturbation spectrum than cobe one , since a probable contribution of primordial gravitational waves into the cobe measured signal .",
    "the latter is the only available today data which we can use to find a signature of cosmic gravitational waves .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath3 , generalises the scale invariant spectrum of density perturbations ( harrison - zeldovich spectrum ) in the simplest way .",
    "a power - law spectrum with @xmath15 ( the `` red '' one ) is predicted in a broad range of inflationary models ( linde , 1983 , lucchin and matarrese , 1985 ) .",
    "in other models it can be both `` blue '' ( @xmath40 ) and non - power - law ( the noncomplete list of references includes : carr and gilbert ( 1994 ) , gottlober and mcket ( 1993 ) , lesgourgues et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , lukash and mikheeva ( 2000 ) , lukash et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , melchiorri et al . ( 1999 ) , mollerach et al . (",
    "1994 ) , semig and mller ( 1996 ) ) . here",
    "we consider the power - law spectra with a free slope index @xmath3 within the range .",
    "the introduction of hot dark matter is related with a recent discovery of the atmospheric neutrino oscillations , which demonstrates that at least one species of neutrino is massive .",
    "a careful theoretical analysis of all neutrino experiments argues for three massive species , but this result still requires a confirmation . in the numerical analysis we assumed that @xmath41 .",
    "actually , the value of @xmath29 becomes important only at small scales ( @xmath42 , e.g. in the analysis of @xmath43-absorbers , the test which we do not consider here ) .",
    "the fourth parameter , @xmath5 , influences the transfer function slightly , so , neither mass function of clusters of galaxies nor large scale cmb anisotropy can reveal its value with a high confidence level .",
    "hovewer , @xmath5 is extremely important for the amplitude of the first acoustic peak of sakharov oscillations .",
    "the last parameter is hubble constant .",
    "till now there is some discrepancy in its measurements ( saha et al . , 1999 ,",
    "jha et al . , 1999 )",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 can not be smaller than 0.5 , but on the other hand , the large value ( @xmath44 ) will contradict the age of the oldest globular clusters .    in our analysis",
    "there are two derived parameters .",
    "the first of them is the abundance of cold dark matter , @xmath45 .",
    "the second one is a relative contribution of primordial gravitational waves into large scale cmb anisotropy , t / s .",
    "the latter parameter can be theoretically calculated in any inflationary model .",
    "t / s is not discriminated by inflation and vary in a broad interval ( we assume t / s@xmath18 $ ] to take into account all possible values ) . for the majority of inflationary models",
    "there is a simple relation between the spectrum slope of primordial gravitational waves , @xmath46 , and t / s : @xmath47 where the numerical coefficient slightly depends on scale ( t / s is calculated here for @xmath48 angular scale ) .",
    "eq.(1 ) allows to replace one parameter ( t / s ) by another ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in power - law inflation there exists an additional relation between @xmath3 and @xmath46 , so in this model t / s can be expressed in terms of @xmath3 .",
    "however , generally such relation is absent ( see , e.g. , lukash et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , lukash and mikheeva(2000 ) ) .",
    "thus , instead of considering additional constraints related with given inflationary model , we prefer to consider @xmath3 and t / s as independent variables within their ranges .",
    "the number of massive halos with the mass larger than @xmath49 can be calculated with help of press - schechter ( p&s ) formalism ( press and schechter , 1974 ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the matter density in the universe , @xmath54 is a critical density contrast necessary to form a halo ( @xmath55 , see gunn and gott ( 1972 ) ) , @xmath56 is a dispersion of linear density perturbations in the sphere of radius @xmath57 which is an integral of the power spectrum of density perturbations @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a dimensionless power spectrum , @xmath60  a primordial spectrum of density perturbations , @xmath61  a normalisation constant , @xmath62  a transfer function which depends on @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( we used the analytic approximation of the transfer function given by novosyadlyj et al . ( 1999 ) ) , @xmath63  fourrier transform of _ top - hat _ filter , @xmath64 .",
    "the figure 1 illustrates how the function @xmath65 depends on @xmath1 with other parameters fixed .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , @xmath1 affects efficiently the height of p&s curves which one can use to determine @xmath1 .",
    "the figure 2 demonstrates the behaviour of @xmath65 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "taking a given @xmath1 ( 0.52 in the figure 2 ) fixes the amplitude of p&s curve at the mass value in the sphere with radius @xmath66 , while different values of @xmath4 change the slope of the curve . in both figures the circles with errorbars",
    "mark the observational data . for the rest parameters",
    ", @xmath65 varies with a much smaller amplitude and we do not adduce the corresponding figures .",
    "the observational data in the figures 1 and 2 are taken from bahcall and cen ( 1993 ) .    to analyse the cosmological models we have used the standard @xmath67 method . at the first step we have calculated @xmath67 for each model ( this function",
    "is @xmath67 distributed with 5 degrees of freedom ; @xmath68 ) .",
    "it turns out that the model with the minimal @xmath67 ( @xmath69 ) has the following parameters : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 . to evaluate the confidence level of this result we took into account the mathematical theorems available for @xmath67 and constructed other distributions for each parameter @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is one of the five cosmological parameters",
    ", @xmath77 is a minimal @xmath67 on the hypersurface @xmath78 in 5-dimensional model space .",
    "@xmath79 is also @xmath67 distributed but has the only degree of freedom .",
    "the confidence levels 1 , 2 and @xmath80 correspond to @xmath81 , 4 , and 9 respectively .",
    "@xmath79 for @xmath82 is shown in the figure 3 ( the curve marked by @xmath83 ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath84 .",
    "the uncertainties of the press - schechter formalism and data systematics enhances the total errorbar to 0.04 ( eke et al . , 1996 ,",
    "borgani et al . , 1999 ) .    to evaluate the accuracy of the approximation of the transfer function and its influence on the output we have repeated this statistical analysis ( see figure 3 , the line marked by @xmath85 ) with another analytic expression for the transfer function ( eisenstein and hu , 1999 ) and found that both approximations lead to the same result .    as to the other cosmological parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) their @xmath79 are under @xmath86 confidence level",
    ", therefore they can not be constrained by the cluster data only .",
    "so , as a result of this part of our analysis we have obtained the high accuracy normalisation of the density perturbation spectra_. it is evident that the obtained value of @xmath1 depends on observational data used and can be slightly different if one uses other data ( e.g. borgani et . , 1999 ) .",
    "the large scale cmb anisotropy is related with metric perturbations ( sachs and wolfe , 1967 ) : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath57 are emission and reception moments of time , @xmath89 is a metric perturbation tensor , @xmath90 is the conformal time derivative , the integral goes along the null geodesics .",
    "the relative contribution of cosmic gravitational waves into the large scale cmb anisotropy ( t / s ) can estimated as follows : @xmath91 where s is the contribution of the density perturbations : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94.\\ ] ]",
    "we evaluate the normalisation constant @xmath61 from eq.(4 ) for @xmath1 , @xmath95 is cobe dmr window function .",
    "figure 4 illustrates t / s as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath70 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the thick line represents the t / s-@xmath3 relation for the power - law inflation .",
    "it can be seen that small values of t / s favour red spectra of density perturbations .",
    "the figure 5 demonstrates t / s as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath6 for @xmath70 , @xmath96 , and large @xmath98 .",
    "the value t / s increases linearly with @xmath6 and decreases with @xmath4 growing , therefore the curves t / s with the maximum parameter @xmath99 can be used to put the lower limit on t / s ( see conclusions ) .    taking a moderate t / s@xmath100 and nearly flat power spectrum ( @xmath101 ) , we put an upper limit on the hubble constant , @xmath102 , and lower limit on the hot dark matter abundance , @xmath103 .",
    "however , the hardest constraint for the parameter @xmath4 can be got when we confront the amplitude of the first acoustic peak in @xmath17 ( @xmath104 ) with the observational data .",
    "= 85 mm    for @xmath70 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 we propose the following approximation for t / s ( the accuracy is better than 11 % for @xmath105t / s@xmath106 ) : @xmath107      to compare the height of the first acoustic peak generated in our models with its value measured by boomerang ( lange et al . , 2000 ) and maxima-1 ( balbi et al . , 2000 ) we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath108 which is the amplitude of the peak in comparison with the large scale cmb anisotropy amplitude : @xmath109 , where @xmath110 ; @xmath111 for boomerang .",
    "evidently , @xmath108 decreases with t / s growing ( and other parameters fixed ) .",
    "e.g. for normalised by @xmath1 standard cold dark matter models ( @xmath112 , @xmath13 , @xmath113 , @xmath97 ) the relative amplitude of the acoustic peak decays by a factor t / s@xmath114 and practically disappears .",
    "the more efficient ways to enhance the first acoustic peak is a transition to the red power spectra and/or high abundance of the hot matter .",
    "the role of the blue spectra becomes important when the parameter @xmath4 rises up ( since the red spectra will contradict to the condition t / s@xmath115 ) .",
    "the results of the derivation are presented in the figure 6 .",
    "the condition for a `` considerable '' acoustic peak ( @xmath116 ) with the instantaneous big bang nucleosynthesis constraint for the baryonic density , leaves us with the standard family of the power spectra ( @xmath19 $ ] ) but requires high fraction of the hot matter ( @xmath20 $ ] ) in the class of the models considered .",
    "varying @xmath5 we found that increasing @xmath5 by factor of two results in a significant rise of the acoustic peak independently on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , so for models with @xmath117 , @xmath118 $ ] and @xmath119 $ ] : @xmath120 . as to the parameter @xmath6 , its increasing decreases the acoustic peak amplitude . summarizing",
    ", we can conclude that mdm models with gravitational waves can marginally reproduce the boomerang result indeed .",
    "* the data on the galaxy cluster abundance determine the value @xmath1 with a high accuracy , the other parameters ( @xmath121 ) remain free within their ranges . * none of the mdm models with @xmath13 and @xmath122 satisfies both normalisations , on the galaxy cluster abundance and large scale @xmath17 anisotropy , which leads either to rejection from the flat spectrum or to the introduction of a non - zero t / s ( or both ) .",
    "* small values of t / s are realised for the red spectra ( @xmath15 ) and moderate @xmath123 , the violation of these conditions leads to a high t / s(@xmath124 ) . *",
    "increasing @xmath4 weakens the requirement to the value of t / s , however even for @xmath10 the models with @xmath11 suggest considerable abundance of gravitational waves : @xmath125 . * in models with @xmath10 and scale - invariant spectrum of density perturbations ( @xmath13 ) : t / s@xmath14 . * in models with @xmath96 and @xmath97 we have the approximation formula for the primordial gravitational wave abundance ( see eq.(10 ) ) . * in double - normalised models with t / s@xmath1260 the height of the acoustic peak is less than its ` standard ' value ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the decrease of the parameter @xmath108 does not exceed 30% in models with large @xmath4 ( @xmath128 $ ] ) and any spectrum slope , @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "any condition , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , decreases the relative amplitude of the first acoustic peak for more than 30@xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath129 in models with @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) .",
    "the acoustic peak practically disappears in cdm models .",
    "* when growing the baryonic abundance the factor @xmath108 increases .",
    "the amplitude of the acoustic peak coincides with its standard value ( @xmath127 ) up to accuracy 10% in models with @xmath117 and both , blue spectra @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath131 as well as moderate red spectra @xmath132 $ ] and @xmath133 . * thus , rising the parameter @xmath4 up to the values in the interval @xmath134 $ ] solves the problem of the first acoustic peak in @xmath17 , leaving the baryonic density within the primordial nucleosynthesis constraints .",
