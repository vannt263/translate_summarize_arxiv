    "although almost 100 years have passed over since the discovery of cosmic rays , their source and acceleration mechanism are still not fully understood .",
    "the energy spectrum and chemical composition of cosmic rays can be key information for probing their origin , acceleration mechanism and propagation mechanism .",
    "the cosmic - ray spectrum has been observed by many ground - based experiments to resemble two power laws , having a form dj / de @xmath4 @xmath5 , with @xmath6 = 2.7 below the energy around 4 @xmath7 @xmath8 ev , and then steepening to @xmath6 = 3.1 above this energy @xcite .",
    "the change of the power index at this energy is called the spectral `` knee '' .",
    "although the existence of the knee has been well established experimentally , there are still controversial arguments on its origin",
    ". proposals for its origin range from astrophysical scenarios like the change of acceleration mechanisms @xcite at the sources of cosmic rays ( supernova remnants , pulsars , etc . ) , the single source assumption @xcite , or effects due to the propagation @xcite inside the galaxy ( diffusion , drift , escape from the galaxy ) to particle - physics models like the interaction with relic neutrinos @xcite during transport or new processes in the atmosphere @xcite during air - shower development .",
    "common to all models is the prediction of a change of the chemical composition over the knee region .",
    "direct measurements of primary cosmic rays on board balloons or satellites are the best ways for the study of the chemical composition , however , the energy region covered by them with sufficient statistics are limited to @xmath0 ev .",
    "the energy spectrum and chemical composition of primary cosmic rays around the knee , therefore , has to be studied with ground - based air - shower experiments using surface array and/or detectors for cerenkov light .",
    "many reports have so far been made on the energy spectrum as well as the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays .",
    "although the global features of the all - particle spectrum agree well when we take into account the systematic errors of about 20% involved in the energy scale @xcite , there are still serious disagreements in the chemical composition depending on experimental methods , for example , the knee composition obtained by the tibet and kascade experiments can be summarized as follows .",
    "we have already reported the energy spectrum of protons and helium in the energy range from 200 tev to 10,000 tev @xcite from air - shower core observation , suggesting a steep power index of approximately -3.1 .",
    "this indicates that the power index of light component is changed from approximately -2.7 as measured by direct observations to -3.1 around a few hundred tev .",
    "hence , the light component should become less abundant at the knee and the main component responsible to the structure of the knee must be heavier than helium . furthermore , the spectral shape of light component seems to keep the power law instead of the exponential cutoff . on the contrary , the kascade using electron - muon size analysis @xcite claims that the knee in the all - particle spectrum is due to the steepening of the spectra of light elements with exponential type cutoff .",
    "the accurate measurement of the all - particle energy spectrum around the knee is essential to establish the chemical composition at this energy range .",
    "there is no precise measurement of the chemical composition around the knee region yet and it is in fact impossible to discriminate individual elements clearly by indirect observations .",
    "therefore , most of the works made so far simply discussed the average mass @xmath9 .",
    "another approach is the unfolding of the all - particle spectrum using shower characteristics like electron - muon ratio , depth of the shower maximum and so on . in these methods , the detailed information of the all - particle spectrum plays an important role in determining the chemical composition .",
    "it is also expected that the specific features of each component like cutoff energy or source characteristics should be reflected in the shape of the all - particle spectrum as discussed in the single source model @xcite .",
    "the important features of the all - particle spectrum are the absolute intensity , the position of the knee , the difference of the power index before and after the knee and the sharpness in the size spectrum , which are deeply connected with the acceleration mechanism and the source of cosmic rays .",
    "the merit of the air - shower experiment in tibet is that the atmospheric depth of the experimental site ( 4300 m a.s.l . , 606 g/@xmath3 ) is close to the maximum development of the air showers with energies around the knee almost independent of the masses of primary cosmic rays as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for vertically incident cosmic rays .",
    "it should be also noted that the number of shower particles is dominated by electromagnetic component with minor contribution of muons , whose interaction model dependence is known to be rather large among current interaction models leading to a large systematic error in the experiments carried out at the sea level because of the large contribution of muons .",
    "in other words , the air shower observation at high altitude is sensitive to the most forward region of the hadronic interactions in the center of momentum system ( cms ) where high energy secondaries are produced , and the electromagnetic component as a decay product of neutral pions dominate the number of shower particles , while it is insensitive to the central region of the cms where large number of muons as decay product of charged pions are produced .",
    "the differences among current interaction models are mainly related to the central region as seen in the problem of the electron - muon correlation .",
    "hence , the air - shower experiment in tibet can determine the primary cosmic - ray energy much less dependently upon the chemical composition and the interaction model than experiments at the sea level .",
    "we have already reported the first result on the all - particle spectrum around the knee region based on data from 2000 november to 2001 october observed by the tibet - iii air - shower array @xcite . in this paper , we present an updated all - particle energy spectrum using data set collected in the period from 2000 november through 2004 october .",
    "the updates are due to ( 1 ) increased statistics by approximately 2.6 times , ( 2 ) use of new simulation codes and ( 3 ) improvement of the lateral structure function used for the size estimation of air showers .",
    "the previous result was obtained using almost the same analysis as used in tibet i @xcite except for the parameters which depend on the detector configuration . in the present paper , the simulation code cosmos",
    "is replaced by corsika with interaction models qgsjet01c and sibyll2.1 , which is now widely used in many analyses by other works and enables the comparison of this work with others easier . the third update on the structure function",
    "is made to cover wider energy range than before ( see section [ modnkg ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtained the all - particle energy spectrum of cosmic rays in a wide range over 3 decades between @xmath0 ev and @xmath1 ev and the updated result is compared with previous ones .",
    "the tibet air - shower experiment has been operated at yangbajing ( e@xmath1031 , n@xmath1106 ; 4300 m above sea level ) in tibet , china , since 1990 .",
    "the tibet air - shower array is designed not only for observation of air showers of nuclear - component origin but also for that of high energy celestial gamma rays .",
    "because of such multiple purposes , the detector is constructed to cover a wide dynamic range for particle density covering 0.1 to 5000 and a good angular resolution for the arrival direction of air showers with energy in excess of a few tev being better than 1 degree .",
    "the tibet - i surface array was constructed in 1990 @xcite using 65 plastic scintillation detectors placed on a lattice with 15 m spacing .",
    "this array was gradually expanded to the tibet - ii ( 1994 ) and tibet - iii ( 1999 ) array . at present",
    ", it consists of 761 fast timing ( ft ) counters and 28 density ( d ) counters surrounding them . in the inner 36,900 m@xmath12 ,",
    "ft counters are deployed at 7.5 m lattice intervals .",
    "all the ft counters are equipped with a fast - timing photomultiplier tube ( ft - pmt ; hamamatsu h1161 ) measuring up to 15 particles . among the 761 ft counters , 249 sets of detectors ( with interval of 15 m )",
    "are also equipped with density photomultiplier tube ( d - pmt ; hamamatsu h3178 ) of wide dynamic range measuring up to 5000 particles in addition to ft - pmts , so that uhe cosmic rays with energy above the knee can be observed with a good accuracy .",
    "each counter has a plastic scintillator plate ( bicron bc-408a ) of 0.5 m@xmath12 in area and 3 cm in thickness . a lead plate of 0.5 cm thick is put on the top of each counter as shown in fig .  [ fig:2 ] in order to increase the counter s sensitivity by converting photons in an electromagnetic shower into electron - positron pairs @xcite .",
    "the recording of signals is made on time and charge information for the ft - pmts , while only the charge information for the d - pmts .",
    "the d counters surrounding the inner array are also equipped with both ft - pmt and d - pmt , where only the charge information of both pmts are recorded .",
    "an event trigger signal is issued when any fourfold coincidence occurs in the ft counters recording more than 0.6 particles .",
    "[ fig:3 ] is the schematic view of the tibet - iii array .",
    "the primary energy of each event is determined by the shower size @xmath13 , which is calculated by fitting the lateral particle density distribution to the modified nkg structure function ( see section [ modnkg ] ) .",
    "the air - shower direction can be estimated with an inaccuracy smaller than 0.2@xmath14 at energies above 10@xmath15 ev , which is calibrated by observing the moon s shadow @xcite .",
    "we used the data set obtained during the period from 2000 november through 2004 october .",
    "the effective live time used for the present analysis is 805.17 days .",
    "monte carlo simulation ( mc ) plays an important role in air - shower experiments since most of the methods of the analysis are developed so that they can reproduce the inputs of simulated events like the primary energy , the location of the shower axis , the arrival direction and so on .",
    "even the most basic quantity like the number of particles arriving to a detector should be defined through mc because we do not measure the number of particles but the charge of pmt - output which is not simply proportional to the number of charged particles entering into the detector if we take into account the contribution of the electromagnetic processes by photons inside the detectors .",
    "another example of the role of mc is to define the effective area of the shower array which should be determined to avoid the erroneous counting of the events whose shower axises are dropping outside of the effective area . therefore detailed mc calculations are needed on air - shower generation in the atmosphere and on the detector response .",
    "consequently , the final result inevitably depends on the interaction model and on the primary composition model in mc .",
    "this is the main source of the systematic errors involved in the air - shower experiment and we try to show them explicitly in the present work .",
    "a full monte carlo ( mc ) simulation has been carried out on the development of air showers in the atmosphere and also on the detector response of the tibet - iii array .",
    "the simulation code corsika ( version 6.204 ) including qgsjet01c and sibyll2.1 interaction models @xcite is used to generate air - shower events .",
    "all shower particles in the atmosphere are traced down to the minimum energy of 1 mev without using thinning method .",
    "although the chemical composition of the primary particles around the knee region is not well established yet , we have to assume it in the simulation . the simplest way to bracket all possibilities",
    "is to assume pure proton and pure iron primaries .",
    "since it is almost evident that such assumptions are not realistic and lead to unacceptable results showing disagreement with the direct observations , these results will be mentioned as extreme cases .",
    "more realistic treatment of the chemical composition is to extrapolate the known composition at low energies measured by direct observations .",
    "the uncertainty in extrapolating to the high energy range can be treated by bracketing the reported results on the composition study around the knee . in order to examine the composition dependence involved in the all - particle spectrum , we used two kinds of the mixed composition models .",
    "one is based on the dominance of heavy component around the knee as reported by works @xcite and this composition is called hd model .",
    "another is based on the dominance of light component ( p and he ) as reported by works @xcite and called pd model .",

    "the shower axis was placed on tibet array at random within a radius of 100 m from the center of the array . in order to treat the mc events in the same way as experimental data analysis , simulated air - shower events were input to the detector with the same detector configuration as the tibet - iii array with use of epics code ( ver .",

    "experimentally , the number of charged particles is defined as the pmt output ( charge ) divided by that of the single particle peak , which is determined by a probe calibration using cosmic rays , typically single muons . for this purpose ,",
    "a small scintillator of 25 cm @xmath7 25 cm @xmath7 3.5 cm thick with a pmt ( h1949 ) is put on the top of the each detector during the maintenance period .",

    "these events triggered by the probe detector was also examined by a mc calculation , in which the primary particles were sampled in the energy range above the geomagnetic cutoff energy at yangbajing ( @xmath1710 gev ) , and all secondary particles which pass the probe detector and the tibet - iii detector simultaneously were selected for the analysis . since the value of pmt output is proportional to the energy loss of the particles passing through the scintillator , the peak position of the energy loss distribution corresponds to the experimental single peak of the probe calibration .    according to the mc",
    ", the peak position of the energy loss in the scintillator is calculated as 6.11 mev ( the details are written in the paper @xcite ) .",
    "we can then calculate the number of charged particles for each detector hit as the total energy loss in each scintillator divided by 6.11 mev instead of counting the number of charged particles arriving to the detector in mc events .",
    "we confirmed that the shape of the energy loss distribution , which is determined by probe - calibration simulation , shows a reasonable agreement with the charge distribution of the experimental data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , where the proportionality between the energy loss @xmath18 and the pmt output charge @xmath19 is assumed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a proportional constant depending on given detector typically being around 4 pc / mev .",
    "thus , all detector responses including muons and the materialization of photons inside the detector are taken into account .",
    "the total number of charged particles of each event ( hereafter , we call this an `` air shower size ( ne )  ) was estimated using the modified nkg lateral distribution function which is tuned to reproduce the above defined number of particles using the monte carlo simulation under our detector configurations .",

    "[ data - selection ] , the surviving number of events is about 5 million , among which 1.9 million events belong to the unbiased energy region corresponding to e0@xmath17100 tev . almost the same number of mc events are obtained for other models to compare with each other .",

    "the reproducibility of the primary flux was carefully examined using mc events and no significant deviation was found between mc input spectrum and the reconstructed spectrum .      the all - particle energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays in a wide range over 3 decades between 1 @xmath7 @xmath0 ev and 1 @xmath7 @xmath1 ev is shown in fig .",

    ".  [ fig:17 ] may lead to different shapes of the all - particle energy spectrum .",
    "the model dependence on the primary composition can be checked by comparing the results of qgsjet+hd and qgsjet+pd .",
    "although the composition is fairly different between the hd and pd model at energies above @xmath8 ev , the difference of the absolute intensity is 20% at most between the two models and decreases with increasing primary energy .",
    "as mentioned above , it may be helpful to show the composition dependence by the pure component assumption .",
    "the difference between pure proton and pure iron primary model becomes large at the lower energy region of the range shown in this figure , where the difference of the intensities between two models exceeds a factor of 3 at 10@xmath15 ev , although these results do not belong to the argument for the reality at least in the energy range lower than a few times 10@xmath15 ev .",
    "it should be noted that the mixed composition models give more realistic extension of the direct observations and the composition model dependence almost disappears above 10@xmath57 ev .",
    "this is the remarkable characteristics of the tibet experiment .",
    "the interaction model dependence is seen by comparing the results of qgsjet+hd and sibyll+hd .",
    "this comparison shows that the shapes of the spectrum from both interaction models are almost the same and the difference in the absolute intensity is within 10% . in fig .",
    "[ fig:19 ] , we show the results using the mixed composition model in comparison with other works including our previous work presented in icrc2003 .",
    "our results seem to lead to the data of direct observation smoothly in the low energy side .",
    "[ fig:20 ] shows the higher energy part above the knee to compare with the surface array experiments done at the highest energy region .",

    "we have analyzed the air shower data set collected in the period from 2000 november through 2004 october with the tibet - iii air - shower array , using the new simulation code corsika , and obtained the all - particle energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays in a wide energy range over 3 decades between @xmath0 ev and @xmath1 ev . the knee of the primary spectrum is clearly observed and its position is located at the energy around 4 pev .    the advantage of the tibet experiment at high altitude is first that the primary energy for the unbiased detection of air showers is sufficiently low for the purpose of the measurement around the knee , and second that the energy determination is insensitive to the number of muons which is dependent on hadronic interaction model and the chemical composition . in order to quantitatively confirm these characteristics , the model dependence on the primary chemical composition",
    "was estimated in terms of the two mixed chemical composition models of hd ( heavy dominant ) and pd ( proton dominant ) , which are extrapolated from the direct observations with different scheme of the fractional contents of the individual elements , together with the extreme cases of pure proton and pure iron .",
    "the interaction model dependence was discussed using qgsjet01c and sibyll2.1 interaction models as they are widely used by other works .",

    "the model dependence is decreasing with increasing primary energy , and it almost disappears above 10@xmath57 ev . although these estimates are limited for the chosen models , other choice of more adequate models , if any , will not change the result of this work drastically because of the weak dependence on the model used .",
    "the uncertainty due to the interaction model will even decrease after the measurement of the cms forward region by the forthcoming experiment lhcf  @xcite .",
    "this is the highest - statistical and the best systematics - controlled measurement covering the widest energy range around the knee energy region .    as discussed above , the main uncertainty left in the all - particle spectrum",
    "is related to the chemical composition .",
    "this work will be extended to the analysis of the air showers with large arrival zenith angle which can show another features of the air - shower development in the atmosphere and provides the information about the chemical composition ( to be published elsewhere ) . as mentioned before ,",
    "we have already reported a paper on the proton and helium spectra around the knee @xcite derived from the hybrid experiment using the air - shower core detector , which is sensitive to the showers of light element origin like proton or helium by selecting the high energy core . from the observed steep power index and the low intensities of proton and helium spectra ,",
    "the dominance of the heavy elements were suggested by the hybrid experiment , however , the statistics were limited due to the high threshold . in the very near future , we will start a new high - statistics hybrid experiment in tibet @xcite to clarify the main component of cosmic rays at the knee .",
    "the core detector will consist of 400 burst detectors located at the center of the tibet - iii array in a grid with the detector interval of 3.75 m .",
    "the burst detectors measure the high energy electromagnetic cascade of the energy above 30 gev developed in lead plate of 3.5 cm thick by shower - core particles .",
    "the new experiment is able to observe the air - shower cores induced by heavy components around and beyond the knee , where direct measurements are inaccessible because of their extremely low fluxes .",
