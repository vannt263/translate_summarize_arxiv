    "complex oxides are characterized by a strong coupling between charge , spin and lattice distortions , giving rise to a rich variety of electronic and magnetic behavior which is at the origin of the multifunctional properties exhibited by this class of materials . in particular ,",
    "much effort is being made towards the control of these properties by means of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "while intrinsic multiferroic materials already exhibit a coupling between magnetic and electric order parameters,@xcite the magnitude of the coupling in these compounds is weak , and a new class of composite materials is being developed that exploit the different properties of the constituent compounds to tailor systems with larger susceptibilities and more varied response functions than those of single component systems .    in this context , the cross coupling in ferroelectric / magnetic heterostructures and composite materials is being intensively studied .",
    "the coupling mechanism can be classified as strain - driven or charge driven : in the first case , the piezoelectric effect of ferroelectrics is used to modify the magnetic properties of ferro- or ferrimagnets via magnetoelastic coupling;@xcite in the second case , the coupling originates from modifications in the electronic properties of the magnetic system driven by charge modulation induced by the polarization state of the ferroelectric.@xcite    a particular case of strain - mediated magnetoelectric coupling occurs in epitaxial heterostructures composed of thin magnetic films grown on batio@xmath0  single crystals , including la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath0,@xcite srruo3,@xcite cofe@xmath3o@xmath4,@xcite fe,@xcite and fe@xmath0o@xmath4,@xcite where the changes in strain occur as a function of temperature via the phase transitions of batio@xmath0  or via applied electric fields .",
    "however , to date , the magnetoelastic coupling has not been addressed explicitly in detail . here , we present analytical expressions for the magnetoelastic contributions to the magnetic anisotropy induced by elastic coupling between the different phases of the batio@xmath0  substrate to the epitaxial magnetic film .",
    "this coupling explains the magnetic behavior exhibited by these systems as a function of temperature in terms of the changes in the magnetoelastic anisotropies .",
    "batio@xmath0  has a simple perovskite structure at high temperatures and undergoes several crystal phase transitions as a function of temperature.@xcite it is cubic in the temperature range from @xmath51733 k to @xmath5393 k ( @xmath6 at 393 k ) , tetragonal at temperatures down to @xmath5278 k ( @xmath7   and @xmath8   at 293 k ) , orthorhombic down to @xmath5183 k ( @xmath9  , @xmath10  , and @xmath11   at @xmath12 k ) , and rhombohedral at lower temperatures ( @xmath13  , @xmath14 at 105 k ) . for temperatures below @xmath5393",

    "although the symmetry group is orthorhombic , with lattice parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 when * p * points along [ 110 ] , it is often convenient to consider the monoclinic cell with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , giving @xmath22  , @xmath23  , @xmath24 at @xmath12 k. for the rhombohedral phase , the polarization points along the @xmath25 directions of the cubic cell , corresponding to an elongation of the cubic cell along * p*.",
    "in the following , we are interested in determining the effect of the in - plane strain on the anisotropy constants of ferromagnetic ( or ferrimagnetic ) films due to magnetoelastic coupling .",
    "we assume that the strain propagates uniformly throughout the film .",
    "when relaxation occurs , as is often the case in real systems , the expressions below correspond to upper bounds to the magnetolastic anisotropy induced in the magnetic system .",
    "if the residual strain is known , the effective anisotropies can be estimated .    to calculate the magnetoelastic anisotropy contributions arising from strain",
    ", we minimize the sum of the elastic ( @xmath26 ) and magnetoelastic ( @xmath27 ) energies for a given strain state of the system .",
    "we consider the case of a cubic magnetic system:@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the direction cosines of the magnetization , @xmath30 are the components of the strain tensor , @xmath31 are the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients , @xmath32 are the elastic constants and @xmath33 are the cartesian coordinate indexes .",
    "the magnetoelastic constants are related to the magnetostriction coefficients by:@xcite @xmath34        for a general in - plane distortion in a cubic lattice , it is straightforward to calculate the in - plane strain tensor components , since by definition the latter correspond to the relative deviations from the equilibrium lattice constant ; with the aid of fig .",

    "the out of plane strain components are free to settle to the values that minimize the total energy ( zero out of plane stress ) .",
    "the magnetoelastic anisotropy is then calculated by finding the minimum of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 inserting ( [ eq : ezz]-[eq : eyz ] ) into the expression for @xmath47 gives , retaining only the terms that depend on the magnetization : @xmath48 + \\\\   & & + b_2\\epsilon_{xy}\\alpha_x\\alpha_y + o(b^2/c)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last term is strain independent , corresponding to a sum of terms of the order of @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 dependencies .",
    "these are much smaller than the first terms and will be ignored in the following discussion .",
    "they arise from a shear strain exerted by the magnetization on the lattice ( which favors specific directions that depend on the relative sign of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients ) and are usually neglected to first order of approximation .",
    "we note that the magnetoelastic terms are uniaxial and lower in symmetry than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the unstrained cubic magnetic system .",
    "a more convenient expression is obtained by using spherical coordinates , where the polar axis is set along the out of plane direction : @xmath53\\sin^2\\theta -\\\\   & & - \\frac{b_1}{2}(1 + 2c_{12}/c_{11})(\\epsilon_{xx}+\\epsilon_{yy})\\cos^2\\theta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first two terms correspond to in - plane magnetoelastic anisotropies , and the last term is the perpendicular magnetoelastic anisotropy contribution .",
    "an in - plane uniaxial anisotropy arises for uniaxial in - plane strains ( @xmath54 ) or for shear strains , although the anisotropy direction is distinct for these two cases : in the first case , it is oriented along the main crystal axes , while for shear strains , the anisotropy is directed along the in - plane diagonal directions .",
    "a perpendicular anisotropy arises when @xmath55 .",
    "the relative magnitude of @xmath56 with respect to the magnetostatic energy term ( shape anisotropy , which favors in - plane magnetization ) , which is on the order of @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the saturation magnetization , determines whether a state of in - plane or perpendicular magnetization is favored . for the particular case of a biaxial strain ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 )",
    ", the magnetoelastic anisotropy energy reduces to a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy term only , with @xmath61 , as expected.@xcite    we consider next the effect of square , rectangular , oblique and rhomboidal distortions on the magnetoelastic anisotropy .",
    "these planar domains arise in the cubic , tetragonal , orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases of batio@xmath0 , and are responsible for the large magnetic anisotropy modulations observed in ferromagnetic / batio@xmath0(001 ) heterostructures .",
    "we consider the magnetoelastic anisotropy constants , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , expressed as : @xmath65\\sin^2\\theta + k_\\mathrm{p}\\cos^2\\theta.\\ ] ] the direction of easy magnetization depends on the particular @xmath66 values ; positive @xmath64 favors in - plane magnetization .",
    "the magnetoelastic anisotropy for the cubic phase of batio@xmath0(@xmath67 , @xmath68 ) leads to zero in - plane anisotropy . for the tetragonal phase ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "two types of domains are possible , @xmath15-domains ( square ) and @xmath38-domains ( rectangular , which may co - exist in two orthogonal directions ) .",
    "a multidomain state can arise when cooling the batio@xmath0  from the cubic to the tetragonal phase after film growth at elevated temperatures , for example .",
    "for this phase , no shear strains are present and @xmath69",
    ". the orthorhombic phase may give rise to ( two ) rectangular ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) and ( two ) oblique ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) domains .",
    "finally , the rhombohedral phase ( @xmath72 , @xmath68 ) is characterized by ( two ) oblique domains .",
    "it also follows that for the oblique domains of the orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases of batio@xmath0 , @xmath74 .",
    "in general , it may be difficult to control the ferroelectric state of batio@xmath0  across the different phase transitions .",
    "for example , the growth of oxide magnetic films is often carried out at elevated temperatures , where batio@xmath0  is cubic and , as the temperature is lowered to room temperature , the batio@xmath0  tends to break into a ferroelectric multidomain state , giving rise to @xmath38 and @xmath15 domains in a batio@xmath0(001 ) single crystal .",
    "similar processes operate at the other phase transitions , leading to the presence of different types of planar domains at the interface with the magnetic film . in such cases",
    ", an effective magnetoelastic anisotropy corresponds to an average over the relative number and size of domains present ; in the case where an equal number of the two possible oblique domains are present in the rhombohedral phase , no effective in - plane anisotropy would result .",
    "however , experimental estimates of the relative population of the different domains is difficult . in the following",
    "we will consider single domain states ; for similar , but orthogonal , domains , the in - plane anisotropy constants will be identical , but with opposite signs , while the perpendicular anisotropies are unaffected .",
    "another difficulty relates to the fact that for systems with large lattice mismatch , such as fe@xmath0o@xmath4 and cofe@xmath3o@xmath4 grown on batio@xmath0 , the strain is strongly reduced for films thicker than the coherent critical thickness through the onset of misfit dislocations;@xcite in the case of fe@xmath0o@xmath4/batio@xmath0(100 ) , the experimental evidence points to full relaxation at the temperature of growth.@xcite here , we do not take explicitly into account the effect of dislocations to the magnetoelastic energy , but instead account for strain relaxation by adjusting the lattice parameter of the magnetic film so that the correct strain value is obtained at the measurement temperature , as will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "we consider three magnetic systems that have been studied experimentally and which are of particular interest : cofe@xmath3o@xmath4,@xcite fe@xmath0o@xmath4 , @xcite and fe films@xcite grown on batio@xmath0 . in table",
    "[ tab : constants ] , we list the relevant materials parameters for these magnetic systems .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we consider first the case of fe@xmath0o@xmath4/batio@xmath0(100 ) epitaxial films , where experimentally it is found that the fe@xmath0o@xmath4 has a residual strain at room temperature with a sign that is opposite that expected from the lattice mismatch with batio@xmath0 ; this has been explained as due to strain relaxation at the temperature of growth , followed by an in - plane dilation due to the abrupt increase in the cell parameters of batio@xmath0  at the cubic to tetragonal phase transition.@xcite therefore , the magnetoelastic anisotropy contribution to the magnetic energy is very different from that expected for a fully strained fe@xmath0o@xmath4 film : while the values for the magnetostriction coefficients of fe@xmath0o@xmath4 favor a state of in - plane magnetization , experimentally a non - zero perpendicular remanence and magnetic anisotropy are observed.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe3o4 ] we present our estimate for the variation of the magnetoelastic anisotropy constants as a function of temperature , where we took into account the temperature variation of the lattice constants of batio@xmath0  and fe@xmath0o@xmath4.@xcite the strain relaxation was taken into account , in a first approximation , by shifting the lattice constant of magnetite such that the out of plane strain at room temperature coincides with the experimental value of 0.62% for tetragonal domains.@xcite this assumes that the misfit dislocation density remains constant throughout the temperature range and across the phase transitions of batio@xmath0 .",
    "one indication that this approach is a simplification over the real processes occurring in the magnetite film is the fact that , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe3o4 ] , the strain in the cubic phase does not drop to zero as the temperature approaches the growth temperature , indicating that a strong temperature dependence of the lattice constant , or misfit dislocation density , may occur in the high temperature range .",
    "the temperature variation of the magnetic anisotropies is instructive , however , and helps explain the variations in the magnetic properties observed experimentally .",
    "focusing on the out of plane anisotropy constant @xmath64 first , we see that negative out of plane strains favor perpendicular anisotropy , which are large for the rectangular domains of the tetragonal phase and for the oblique domains of the orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases ; they are smaller by a factor of about 2 for the square domains of the tetragonal phase and the rectangular domains of the orthorhombic phase . depending on the particular domain path followed by the batio@xmath0  substrate ,",
    "it is clear that large changes in the magnetic anisotropies may follow .",
    "for example , the experimental results of vaz et at.@xcite can be explained if , starting from a rectangular domain at room temperature , the batio@xmath0  surface reverts to a rectangular domain in the orthorhombic phase , corresponding to a drop in the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy , followed by an increase in @xmath64 in the rhombohedral phase .",
    "the in - plane anisotropies are also significant , but they tend to be smaller than the perpendicular anisotropies .",
    "the presence of multidomains in batio@xmath0  also tends to average out the in - plane effective anisotropy .",

    "square symbols correspond to anisotropy in planar square domains , diamonds to oblique domains , and rectangles to rectangular domains ; full symbols are for in - plane anisotropies , empty symbols for the perpendicular anisotropy constants . ]",
    "it must be emphasized that a negative @xmath64 is not sufficient to yield perpendicularly magnetized films , since the in - plane magnetostatic ( shape ) anisotropy must also be overcome , and the latter is on the order of @xmath75 erg/@xmath76 for magnetite , assuming bulk magnetization ( thin magnetite films are known to exhibit a slightly reduced magnetization , which would lead to a smaller magnetostatic energy).@xcite this value would imply that the fe@xmath0o@xmath4/batio@xmath0  films would remain in - plane magnetized , but this assumes a state of uniform strain ; in real films , one may expect larger interface strains that could give rise to larger magnetoelastic anisotropies than those predicted in our simple model calculations .      we consider here the case when the cofe@xmath3o@xmath4 film is fully strained to the batio@xmath0  substrate , a situation which is expected to occur at thicknesses below the coherent growth thickness .",

    "large jumps in the magnetization are observed at the tetragonal to orthorhombic and orthorhombic to rhombohedral phase transitions of batio@xmath0 .",

    "these changes in the magnetization can be understood by assuming predominantly square domains in the tetragonal phase of batio@xmath0 , which give similar anisotropies for both the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions ; the presence of a small number of rectangular domains , or a small imbalance in the two possible rectangular domains , would give rise to a small uniaxial magnetic anisotropy favoring , say , the [ 010 ] direction ; these domains would either remain rectangular in the orthorhombic phase or revert to oblique domains . in the orthorhombic phase ,",
    "the square domains change to rectangular and the increase in magnetic energy along the [ 100 ] direction ( leading to a smaller magnetization ) could result from rectangular domains that are predominantly elongated along the [ 100 ] direction ( the easy axis direction is along the direction of compression for cofe@xmath3o@xmath4 , which has @xmath88 ) .",
    "the transition to the rhombohedral phase would lead to similarly small magnetic anisotropies for both [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] directions , leading to an increase in magnetic energy for the [ 010 ] direction , and a decrease along the [ 100 ] direction . despite clear hysteresis in the ferroelectric transitions of batio@xmath0",

    "[ fig : fe ] . due to the strong crystal field of metallic fe , the orbital moment is quenched , and the magnetic anisotropies are relatively small in this system .",
    "it can be seen that for fe / batio@xmath0(100 ) , the perpendicular magnetoelastic anisotropies favor perpendicular magnetization , but given the very large magnetostatic energy of fe ( @xmath89 erg/@xmath76 ) , an in - plane magnetized state is energetically more favorable .",
