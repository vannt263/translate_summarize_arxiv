    "two goals are targeted in this opus .",
    "the first stems from various indications that ir environments may demonstrate non - classical behavior , similar to that of quantum objects , and we would like to study the emergence of these effects on simple , ` tame ' models .",
    "the second is to operate the idea that the volume of data corpora became so large that it can be treated to be a continuous medium like it is done in solid state physics ( this option was highlighted in @xcite ) and information retrieval becomes akin to quantum measurement .    in order to simulate the emergence of quantum behavior we suggest a toy model with few parameters which can be physically based on classical or quantum material .",
    "the principal assumption for the model are :    * the number of retrieved documents is potentially infinite * both the relevance ( non - relevance ) of a document and the occurrence of a particular term @xmath0 in it are measurable properties , which are subject to physical measurement * the properties form an infinite set * the method we use to enhance the performance is query expansion : we take a term @xmath0 and , within a given query , pre - select documents by possessing the term @xmath1    based on this principles , we suggest a toy model of information retrieval .",
    "more precisely , we consider two models built in a similar way , but with the difference that the first is based on classical objects ( macro - objects ) governed by boolean logic , while the second deals with quantum microparticles .",
    "then , we carry out a series of numerical experiments with both models , the design of the experiments is similar and we explore the deviation of the internal logic of the second model from the boolean one . as a measure of this discrepancy",
    "we use accardi statistical invariant @xcite associated with each term @xmath0 .",
    "the results of the numerical evaluations are then compared with the results of a similar experiment performed over tipster test collection @xcite .",
    "let us first exactly describe the settings we assume for our toy model .",
    "we are not going to deal with average precision ( ap ) , rather , dwell on a simpler thing : just increasing the precision , saying nothing about the recall .",
    "that is , we use strictly one tool : query expansion by pre - filtering of term occurrence , and nothing more .",

    "initial setting .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    first , the relevance is tested .",
    "both relevance and non - relevance are nothing but properties , in our simple model they will correspond to states @xmath2 , @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "after the relevance is justified , we check the occurrence of certain term @xmath0 .",
    "again , the term occurrence is nothing but a property , and we check the documents if they possess it .",

    "this is done as follows : leaving the query , that is , the state @xmath5 the same , we perform a pre - selection and take only those documents which contain the term @xmath0 . @xmath6 then the result of the initial and of the updated queries are compared by forming @xmath7 which can take both positive and negative values depending on the choice of the term @xmath0 .",
    "melucci metaphor is a unified view to represent simplified ir environment with no reference to particular underlying logic . according to it @xcite , the ir procedure",
    "is represented by a two - slit experiment , widely known in physics .",
    "the ir system is thought of as a laboratory with the source , which supplies documents according to the input query .",
    "the documents within melucci metaphor are particles , they may be of classical or quantum nature , or , perhaps , of some other kind .",
    "we do not dwell on the mechanism of producing this flux of documents - particles .",
    "what is essential , is that the number of ejected documents is supposed to be potentially infinite , but we analyze only first @xmath8 documents .",

    "let us pass to exact numerical results .",
    "in order to evaluate the discrepancy , accardi statistical invariant is used : @xmath14 when the ir environment is classical , holds , therefore @xmath15 @xmath16 that is why @xmath17 in classical realm . in quantum",
    "setting this is violated , see section [ squant ] for numerical results .",
    "in this case we suppose that the documents are like balls in an urn .",
    "we evaluate the probability of relevance ( non - relevance , respectively ) as the following ratios , introducing the notation : @xmath18 the next step of our toy scenario is to test _ afterwards _ the occurrence of a term @xmath1 .",
    "this gives rise to conditional probabilities , which are evaluated as follows together with the notations : @xmath19 then apply the bayes formula : @xmath20 using the parameters introduced above @xmath21 now we are in a position to evaluate the expected boost of precision . substituting to , we have @xmath22 in the sequel , for the comparison , we shall need the expression for accardi statistical invariant for this case which for classical case is @xmath23 .",
    "in this setting we assume that the documents form the flux of spin-1/2 quantum particles . for them ,",
    "the state space is two - dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath24 . for the sake of convenience",
    "choose the properties @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be basis vectors .",
    "the query state @xmath5 is a vector , denote it coordinates ; @xmath27 then the probabilities are expressed by the same formulas as in classical case , namely @xmath28 and the conditional probabilities for the term @xmath0 : @xmath29 due to the laws of quantum mechanics @xmath30 this is because we decided to wait for the same number of documents to arrive . in ` visible ' terms that means that the search engine with pre - selection will work longer than without it . as a result ,",
    "within our model we say nothing about recall , dealing only with precision of the ir process .",
    "the expression for the precision boost reads in this case : @xmath31 calculate the accardi statistical invariant for quantum case @xmath32 and see that it can take any real value .",
    "having the two models , classical and quantum , we perform numerical simulations .",
    "we take uniformly distributed values of the parameters of both models  classical and quantum  and create the scatterplots , each points with coordinates @xmath33 .",
    "the left plot corresponds to classical model ( balls from an urn ) , and the right one depicts the results from quantum model ( spin-@xmath34 particle ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     looking at quantum picture we see that , if the physical model is quantum , better boost is obtained by expanding queries with ` non - classical ' terms , those violating the accardi restriction @xmath35 .",
    "now look at the results of the experiments carried out over tipster collection with the same coordinate axes @xcite :        these are the data based on real - world ir environment and we see that they are more similar to quantum pattern than to classical one .",
    "we see that the experimental results over large data collections demonstrate features of quantum behavior . in order to mimic quantum indeterminacy ,",
    "the access to complete knowledge about the system was artificially restricted . but this phenomenon is generic for information retrieval !",
    "the point is that search engines store some limited data about the documents rather than the documents themselves .",
    "this is a natural restriction for the access to the documents to be complete , which , in turn , could be the reason for the observed non - classicality .",
    "the author appreciates cris calude , karl svozil and jozef tkadlec for stimulating discussions on quantum contextuality during my stay in technical university of vienna , supported by the ausseninstitut and the institute of theoretical physics of the vienna university of tech- nology .",
