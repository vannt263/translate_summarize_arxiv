    "<S> recently , much attention has been directed to understanding how these correlations behave in a relativistic setting @xcite . from the practical viewpoint </S>",
    "<S> a good example is relativistic quantum metrology , which exploits non - inertial effects on quantum entanglement to develop extremely high - precision parameter estimation protocols , with signal - to - noise ratios that often achieve the heisenberg limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these metrology protocols have been employed to conceive precision measurements of unruh temperatures and effects of gravity on entanglement @xcite@xcite @xcite , as well as to conceive novel schemes for gravitational wave detection which may provide feasible alternatives to experiments such as ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ) and may be within technological reach in the near future @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the interest on relativistic effects on entanglement does not arise only from its role as a resource for quantum information tasks . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes entanglement itself may actually encode the parameters of interest in relativistic settings . </S>",
    "<S> one example is given by the parameters of the large - scale spacetime metric . </S>",
    "<S> it has long been known that in the context of expanding spacetimes in general , pairs of entangled particles are dynamically created into modes of opposite momenta of a free scalar field @xcite for instance . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of entanglement generated by a period of expansion may be determined by the spacetime metric . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggest that measurement of these quantum correlations offers a tool to estimate the parameters that characterize the scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> moreover in @xcite it is discussed that cosmic neutrinos may encode entanglement generated in the early universe epoch which could possibly survive to be detected , since they interact very weakly with other sources of energy and matter .    </S>",
    "<S> the role of interactions is evidently important in this proof - of - principle level as new phenomena occur , such as a competition between multiparticle production from the vacuum and thermalization @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> the interaction leads the system towards equilibrium , while the spacetime expansion deviate the system from equilibrium because of entropy production and particle creation . </S>",
    "<S> interacting processes over this type of spacetime background can lead , depending on statistics , either to gravitational amplification or attenuation of particle creation @xcite , and the exact impact these effects will have on the amount of entropy and quantum correlations generated has many subtleties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the context of inflationary theory @xcite , there are several works which point out how the different aspects of the quantum - to - classical transition of quantum inflaton fluctuations are realized and favored when the inflaton participates in interacting processes in general @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ubiquitous interactions between fields could possibly supress the modewise entanglement initially present at one of them . if strong enough , they could render it impossible to use as suggested above .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is interesting to quantify and understand the effect of self - interactions and interactions between quantum fields on particle creation , entropy generation and quantum entanglement during a period of spacetime expansion . of course </S>",
    "<S> , treating interactions in quantum field theory over expanding spacetimes faces several technical difficulties , which tend to obscure the analysis of basic qualitative features of quantum information measures . having this in mind , we present in this letter a study of a solvable two - field model generating bipartite correlations , and we show explicitely how the modewise free - field quantum entanglement undergoes gravitational enhancement generated by the interaction when the two fields are massive </S>",
    "<S> .    we will quantify the information content of field states over asymptotically flat robertson - walker spacetimes using the concept of the covariance matrix for quantum fields @xcite . besides providing qualitative insights about the interaction effects on the quantum fields correlations , the techniques that we present here are also useful for more complex interacting theories based on variational solution in the schrdinger representation .    </S>",

    "<S> we consider the fields propagating in a robertson - walker ( rw ) spacetime with metric @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the conformal time @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the scale factor defined by @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being positive real parameters controlling the total volume and rapidity of the expansion , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath7 is smooth and approaches constant values in the distant past ( @xmath11 ) and far future ( @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in these limits the spacetime described by the above metric is minkowskian . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is clear by definition that the rw spacetime is conformally flat : @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> we work in the heisenberg picture . introducing the auxiliary field defined by @xmath14 , ( [ l ] ) can be written as @xmath15.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    writing the field and its conjugated momentum in fourier components as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the @xmath18 must be a linear combination @xmath19 of the mode functions @xmath20 that form the basis of the space of solutions of the equations of motion @xmath21    here the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath5 , and the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy the usual commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators . </S>",

    "<S> in which spacetime is not stationary but possesses stationary asymptotic regions , we can give a particle interpretation to the solution of the field equations in both the distant past and future . </S>",

    "<S> the asymptotic solutions above are connected by a bogoliubov transformation that only mixes modes of the same momentum k : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are bogoliubov coefficients . using the properties of the hypergeometric functions , </S>",
    "<S> the bogoliubov coefficients in the limit of smooth expansion @xmath35 are given by @xmath36    we will restrict our attention here to the case where the field is in the initial vacuum state @xmath37 in the in region . </S>",
    "<S> we can focus the analysis on the @xmath38 , @xmath39 sector of the density matrix for a fixed wavenumber @xmath38 , since the lagrangian density we consider here will only mix modes of opposite momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this mixing of positive- and negative - frequency modes of the same wavenumber by the dynamics of spacetime leads to excitation of vacuum fluctuations , and consequently to particle creation . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the initial vacuum state for the out region will be a generic two - mode squeezed vacuum @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the two - mode squeezing operator , and where the squeezing parameter @xmath42 is related to the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath43 by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in order to quantify information about entropy and quantum correlations generated by spacetime dynamics between these modes of the field ( that get mixed ) , it is convenient to switch to the covariance matrix ( cm ) formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the cm formalism is very useful to study entanglement and other correlations in the context of bipartite gaussian states evolving under gaussian channels @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the fact that all the information about a gaussian state is encoded in the first and second moments of the quadrature field operators . </S>",
    "<S> these statistical moments uniquely determine a gaussian state and offer a parametrization of the submanifold of the space of density operators formed by the gaussian states . in our case , the cm for @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47    where @xmath48 denote the the generalized position and momentum operators of the fields as given by @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the cm @xmath50 above has to satisfy the following uncertainty relation : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the two - mode symplectic matrix defined as @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this generalized uncertainty inequality simply reflects the positivity of the density matrix . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the covariance submatrices for the individual reduced single - mode states of the modes @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , while @xmath7 contains the cross - correlations between the particles excitations created in these modes by spacetime expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 contains four local symplectic invariants given by the determinants det@xmath55 , det@xmath56 , det@xmath7 and det@xmath58 . in the case @xmath59 , we have det@xmath60 det@xmath61 , det@xmath62 and det@xmath63 ( see appendix a ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that det@xmath60 det@xmath56 for every @xmath64 , since the cm @xmath58 represents a symmetric bipartite gaussian state where the energy is equally distributed between the modes @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in terms of the symplectic invariants </S>",

    "<S> quantities written as functions only of @xmath73 refer to the asymptotic state ( [ eq : revgus1_1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> previously , we saw that the vacuum state in the asymptotic past evolves into the mode - wise mixed gaussian state ( [ eq : revgus1_1 ] ) in the asymptotic future . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the degree of mixedness of a quantum state can be characterized by the purity , which can be written as the following function of the cm @xmath58 for gaussian states such as @xmath46 : @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value is @xmath75 , in the case of a pure state .    </S>",

    "<S> for gaussian states such as @xmath46 , the von neumann entropy is easily expressed in terms of the symplectic eigenvalues of the cm @xmath58 : @xmath78 , with the function @xmath79 defined by @xmath80    the total correlations belonging to the bipartite quantum state @xmath46 may be quantified by its mutual information @xmath81 , defined as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 refer to von neumann entropy of the reduced states obtained by tracing over the variables of the party @xmath39 and @xmath38 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> building upon the relation ( [ ab ] ) for the bogoliubov coefficients , we obtain the following expression of the mutual information in terms of the spacetime expansion parameters : @xmath85 .    </S>",
    "<S> remember that a quantum state @xmath76 is said to be separable with respect to the bipartition into subsystems @xmath86 and @xmath87 if and only if it can be expressed in the following form : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are single - mode reduced density matrices of the subsystems @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , quantum states that can not be decomposed in this form are said to be entangled . </S>",
    "<S> for bipartite gaussian states such as @xmath46 , a well - known sufficient condition for separability is the so - called peres - horodecki - simon ( phs ) criterion , which is based on the positivity of the partially transported density matrix ( ppt criterion ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the partial transposition operation of the density matrix for the bipartite gaussian state @xmath46 changes the symplectic invariant @xmath93 to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 with @xmath96 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> now , the symplectic eigenvalues @xmath97 of the partially transposed cm @xmath98 read @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the ppt criterion reduces then to a simple inequality that must be satisfied by the smallest symplectic eigenvalue @xmath100 of the partially transposed state : @xmath101 .    the amount of violation of the ppt criterion for separability by a state is often used as a measure of its degree of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> more formally , we can use the previous results to write the smallest symplectic eigenvalue for the asymptotic state @xmath102 as @xmath103    and we can quantify its degree of entanglement in the ppt sense by the logarithmic negativity @xmath104 , defined as the following monotone decreasing function of @xmath100 : @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the symplectic eigenvalue @xmath106 completely qualifies and quantifies the entanglement of the quantum state ( [ eq : revgus1_1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have seen in the above discussion that spacetime dynamics generates mode correlations ( namely , between every pair of modes of opposite momentum ) even for a free quantum field @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> now , we want to see how these correlations are affected when the field interacts with a second party @xmath108 . </S>",
