    "the presence of a substantial population of gas giant planets on orbits interior to 1 au poses a challenge to models of planet formation and migration .",
    "standard core accretion models favor giant planet formation beyond the ice line , where core - nucleated accretion may proceed on a timescale substantially shorter than the lifetime of the disk @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "gas giant planets on short period orbits most likely migrated in from their original formation locations @xcite .",
    "migration models for these planets can be divided into two broad categories .",
    "the first is smooth disk migration , in which exchanges of angular momentum with the disk causes the planet s orbit to gradually decay .",
    "this mechanism would be expected to produce close to , if not completely , circular orbits that are well aligned with the spin axis of the host star @xcite .",
    "the second migration channel is three - body interactions .",
    "these include the kozai mechanism , in which the presence of a stellar or planetary companion causes the argument of periastron to undergo resonant librations , allowing the planet s orbit to exchange between mutual inclination and eccentricity .",
    "alternatively , planet - planet scattering or long term secular interactions between planets could impart a large orbital eccentricity to the inner planet @xcite .",
    "this highly eccentric orbit can then shrink and circularize at short periods via tidal dissipation .",
    "high eccentricity migration channels and dynamical interactions between planets are thought to frequently produce planets whose orbits are misaligned with the rotation axes of their host stars . over the past decade ,",
    "rossiter - mclaughlin measurements of spin - orbit alignment have found a number of hot jupiter systems that are misaligned @xcite .",
    "however , previous studies demonstrated that there is no correlation between the presence of an outer planetary or stellar companion and the spin - orbit angle of hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , batygin ( 2012 ) and batygin @xmath2 adams ( 2013 ) have suggested that a distant stellar companion could tilt the protoplanetary disk with respect to the star s spin axis , in which case disk migration could lead to a misaligned orbit @xcite .",
    "this scenario is supported by the discovery of apparently coplanar multi - planet systems with spin - orbit misalignments @xcite , although other surveys have suggested that such systems may be relatively rare @xcite . in either case",
    ", it appears that the cause of hot jupiter misalignment is more complicated than the simple picture presented above .",
    "measurements of orbital eccentricities for a large sample of single and multi - planet systems provide a more direct diagnostic of the importance of dynamical interactions in shaping the observed architectures of planetary systems .",
    "we expect dynamical interactions between planets to pump up the eccentricities of their orbits , a process that could result in migration if the periapse of an orbit gets close enough to the star for tidal forces to become significant @xcite .",
    "however , previous radial velocity studies of gas giants indicate that high eccentricities are more common in apparently single systems @xcite . it has been suggested that this enhanced eccentricity may be due to planet - planet scattering , where one planet was ejected from the system @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , which suggest that higher eccentricities are more common when the star has a high metallicity , and infer that this is because higher metallicity stars are more likely to form multiple giant planets , which then interact and pump up planet eccentricities .",
    "@xcite also find a positive correlation between lower eccentricity and higher system multiplicity .",
    "conversely , @xcite finds that warm jupiters with outer companions are more likely to have higher eccentricities than single warm jupiters , albeit with a relatively small sample size of just 26 systems .",
    "we can test these trends by directly searching for outer companions at wide orbital separations in a large sample of known planetary systems , and checking to see if these companions are associated with a larger orbital eccentricity for the inner planet .    in order to understand",
    "whether or not dynamical interactions between planets are responsible for the inward migration of a subset of these planets , it is useful to study systems where we can obtain a complete census of gas giant planets across a broad range of orbital separations . while large surveys have made it possible to understand the statistical properties of exoplanet populations , recent studies have focused on determining mass distributions and occurrence rates of short period , low mass planets around apparently single main sequence fgk stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . many of these surveys are primarily sensitive to short - period planets , making it difficult to evaluate the role that a massive distant planetary companion might have on the formation and orbital evolution of the inner planets . early studies of hot jupiters , which are among the best - studied exoplanet populations , indicated that they rarely contain nearby companions ( steffen et al .",
    "2012 , but see becker et al .",
    "2015 for a recent exception ) .",
    "in contrast , recent work by knutson et al ( 2014 ) looked at 51 hot jupiter systems and found that they are not lonely - the occurrence rate of massive , outer companions was @xmath3 for companions with masses of 1 - 13 @xmath1 and separations of 1 - 20 au .",
    "this implies that long period companions to hot jupiters are common , and thus might play an important role in the orbital evolution of these systems . in this study",
    "we combine keck hires radial velocity measurements with nirc2 k band adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging to search for massive , long period companions to a sample of 123 known exoplanet systems detected using the radial velocity ( rv ) method .",
    "unlike our previous survey , which focused exclusively on transiting hot jupiter systems , our new sample includes planets with a wide range of masses and orbital separations ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we present results from this survey in two papers . in this paper , we focus on long - term rv monitoring of the confirmed exoplanet systems , probing planetary and brown dwarf mass companions out to @xmath4100 au .",
    "we test whether close - in gas giant planets are more likely to have outer companions than their long period counterparts , and whether planets in two - planet systems are more likely to have higher eccentricities than single planet systems .",
    "in the second paper , we will use our complementary k - band ao images to find and confirm low mass stellar companions in these systems in order to determine how stellar companions might influence the formation and evolution of the inner planets . in section 2",
    "we describe the selected sample of systems , as well as the methods for obtaining the rv and k - band ao imaging data . in section 3",
    "we describe fits to the rv data , generation of contrast curves from the ao data , identification of significant rv accelerations , calculation of two - dimensional companion probability distributions , and the completeness analysis that was performed for each individual system .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss our occurrence rate calculations and analysis of eccentricity distributions .",
    "radial velocity measurements were made at keck observatory as part of more than a dozen pi - led programs falling under the umbrella of the california planet survey ( cps ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we observed each target star using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) @xcite following standard practices of cps .",
    "our selected sample includes all known one- and two - planet systems discovered via the radial velocity method with at least ten rv observations obtained using hires .",
    "we also excluded systems with a keck baseline shorter than the published orbital period .",
    "the published planets in our resulting sample of 123 systems span a range of masses and semi - major axes , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "rv baselines for these targets range from 5.02 to 18.18 years , making it possible to detect gas giant planets spanning a broad range of orbital semi - major axes .",
    "properties of the target stars are described in table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of stellar masses in our sample .",
    "while most stars are f and g stars , there are significant numbers of m , k , and a stars .",
    "the a stars in this sample are all moderately evolved , which facilitates precise radial velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "all of the target stars were observed using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) on keck i @xcite .",
    "while the majority of the rv data used in this study was published in previous papers , we also obtained new observations that extend these published baselines by up to 12 years . to reduce the rv data , the standard cps hires configuration and reduction pipeline were used ( wright et al 2004 ; howard et al 2009 ; johnson et al 2010 ) .",
    "we measured doppler shifts from the echelle spectra using an iodine absorption spectrum and a modeling procedure descended from @xcite and described in @xcite .",
    "the set of observations for each star comprise a  template spectrum \" taken without iodine and de - convolved using a reference point spread function ( psf ) inferred from near - in - time observations of b - stars through iodine , and a set of dozens to hundreds of observations through iodine that each yield an rv .",
    "we used one of the 0-wide slits ( ` b5 ' or ` c2 ' ) for the observations taken through iodine and a 0 ( ` b1 ' or ` b3 ' ) or 0-wide slit for the template observations . using a real - time exposure meter , integration times of 18 minutes were chosen to achieve ( in most cases ) a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath4220 in the reduced spectrum at the peak of the blaze function near 550 nm .",
    "all doppler observations were made with an iodine cell mounted directly in front of the spectrometer entrance slit .",
    "the dense set of molecular absorption lines imprinted on the stellar spectra provide a robust wavelength fiducial against which doppler shifts are measured , as well as strong constraints on the shape of the spectrometer instrumental profile at the time of each observations @xcite . the velocity and corresponding uncertainty for each observation",
    "is based on separate measurements for @xmath4700 spectral chunks each 2  wide .",
    "the rvs are corrected for motion of keck observatory through the solar system ( barycentric corrections ) .",
    "the measurements span 19962015 ( see table 2 ) .",
    "measurements made after the hires ccd upgrade in 2004 august have a different ( arbitrary ) velocity zero point ( not the star s systemic velocity ) and suffer from somewhat smaller systematic errors .",
    "a summary of the radial velocity data used in this work is provided in table 2 .",
    "we include best - fit stellar jitter and rv acceleration  trend \" values from our orbital solution fitting described in section 3 .",
    "we observed @xmath5 band images for all targets using the nirc2 instrument ( instrument pi : keith matthews ) on keck ii .",
    "we used natural guide star ao imaging and the narrow camera setting ( 10@xmath6mas@xmath6pixel@xmath7 ) to achieve better contrast and spatial resolution . for most targets , we imaged using the full nirc2 array ( 1024@xmath81024 pixels ) and used a 3-point dither pattern that avoids nirc2 s noisier quadrant .",
    "because nirc2 does not have neutral density filters , we used the subarray mode ( 2.5 `` or 5 '' field of view ) to decrease readout time when it was necessary to avoid saturation .",
    "we typically obtained two minutes of on - target integration time per system in position angle mode .",
    "we use dome flat fields and dark frames to calibrate the images .",
    "we identify image artifacts by searching for pixels that are @xmath9 outliers compared to the counts in the surrounding 5@xmath85 box .",
    "we replace these pixels by the median value of the same 5@xmath85 box .",
    "to compute contrast curves , we register all frames with the target star and then combine using a median stack .",
    "table 3 summarizes the nirc2 ao observations taken during this survey that were used in subsequent analysis .",

    "the presence of a distant , massive companion manifests as a long - term acceleration for observations with baselines significantly shorter than the companion s orbital period ( e.g. crepp et al 2012 ) . to detect and quantify the significance of these  trends \" , we performed a uniform analysis of these systems using a markov chain monte carlo technique .",
    "the initial set of parameter values for the mcmc run were determined using a @xmath276 minimization fitting procedure . for a single - planet system ,",
    "the mcmc algorithm simultaneously fit eight free parameters to the rv data - six orbital parameters ( the velocity semi - amplitude , the period of the orbit , the eccentricity of the orbit , the argument of periastron , the true anomaly of the planet at a given time , and the arbitrary rv zero point ) , a linear velocity trend , and a stellar jitter term @xcite .",
    "this additional error term is added to the internal uncertainty of each radial velocity measurement in quadrature .",
    "all parameters had uniform priors . while it is formally correct to use log priors for parameters such as the velocity semi - amplitude , jitter term , and linear trend , we find that our use of uniform priors has a negligible effect on our posterior pdfs .",
    "we initialize our mcmc chains using the published parameters for the inner planets in these systems , which are typically quite close to our final best - fit parameters .",
    "furthermore , we note that the choice of prior should only affect the posterior probability distributions in the data - poor regime ; in this case the data provide good constraints on the parameters in question , and as a result the posterior pdf is effectively independent of our choice of prior .",
    "the likelihood function used in this analysis is given in equation 1 , where @xmath277 is the instrumental error , @xmath278 is the stellar jitter , @xmath279 are the data , and @xmath280 is the model .    @xmath281    the confidence intervals on each parameter were obtained from their posterior distribution functions .    on august 19 2004 ,",
    "the hires ccd was upgraded , leading to a different rv zero point for data taken before and after this date . for systems with keck hires",
    "rvs obtained prior to 2004 , we include an offset parameter between the two datasets as an additional free parameter .",
    "although there is some evidence that the post - upgrade jitter is lower than the pre - upgrade jitter by approximately 1 m / s ( e.g. howard et al . 2014 ) , we find that this change is much smaller than the average jitter level for the majority of our targets , and our decision to fit a single jitter term across both epochs is therefore unlikely to have a significant effect on our conclusions .",
    "approximately 30@xmath282 of our targets have no pre - upgrade data at all , while an additional 50@xmath282 have fewer than ten data points pre- or post - upgrade , making it difficult to obtain meaningful constraints on the change in jitter between these two epochs ( e.g. , fulton et al .",
    "we therefore conclude that a uniform approach to these fits is preferable to a more customized approach in which we include two separate jitter terms for the approximately 20@xmath282 of systems where such an approach is feasible .",
    "in addition to reproducing the published solutions of confirmed exoplanets , we detected eight new long - period planets with fully resolved orbits in systems gj 317 , hd 4203 , hd 33142 , hd 95089 , hd 99706 , hd 102329 , hd 116029 , and hd 156279 .",
    "trends were previously mentioned for gj 317 @xcite , hd 4203 @xcite , hd 95089 @xcite , hd 99706 @xcite , and hd 116029 @xcite .",
    "we note that the two planets in hd 116029 are in 3:2 period commensurability . to assess whether a dynamical model fit was needed , we used the mercury integrator to numerically integrate the orbits of both planets in hd 116029 in order to determine the magnitude of the change in orbital parameters .",
    "we found that over the observational window of @xmath283 years , the orbital elements of both planets varied by less than a fraction of a percent .",
    "thus we conclude that a keplerian model fit is sufficient to characterize the planets in hd 116029 .",
    "relevant characteristics of the new outer planets are listed in table 5 , and the corresponding rv solutions are plotted in figures 3 through 10 .",
    "rv measurements for these eight systems are listed in table 4 .",
    "we considered a linear trend detection to be statistically significant if the best - fit slope differed from zero by more than 3@xmath284 , and report best - fit trend slopes and stellar jitter values for all systems in table 2 .",
    "the nominal values quoted in this table are taken from the @xmath276 fits , and the errors come from the mcmc analysis .",
    "we detected 20 statistically significant trends due to the presence of an outer companion .",
    "we find that all but 16 of our orbital solutions for the known inner planets in these systems were consistent with the published orbits at the 2@xmath284 level or better .",
    "of the solutions that changed , the majority were systems with long - period planets for which our newly extended baseline provided a more tightly constrained orbital solution .",
    "this longer baseline was particularly important for systems with both long - period planets and rv accelerations , such as hd 190360 .",

    "in contrast to this result , figure 18 indicates that the mass distribution of the long - period companions in our study is consistent with the negative @xmath558 value ( i.e. increasing frequency with decreasing planet mass ) reported by cumming et al . for the population of planets interior to 3 au .",
    "we next consider how the frequency of companions in these systems varies as a function of other parameters , including the inner planet mass , semi - major axis , and stellar mass .",
    "we select an integration range of @xmath619 @xmath1 and 5 - 20 au for these companions ; this range is large enough to include all known companions detected by our survey , while still remaining small enough to ensure that we do not extrapolate too far beyond the region in which we are sensitive to companions .",
    "we find that within this integration range , the total occurrence rate for massive , long - period companions is @xmath620 .",
    "@xcite showed that planet occurrence rates and system architecture vary as a function of stellar mass .",
    "the a and m star systems are the high and low extremes of the sample s stellar mass range .",
    "to address the concern that including a and m star systems would influence our final results , we ran the entire grid search and mcmc analyses again excluding the 29 a and m star systems in the sample .",
    "the occurrence rate for this fgk - only sample is @xmath621 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the occurrence rates for the sample with and without the a and m stars are consistent with each other at the @xmath622 level .    following the total occurrence rate calculation , we calculated the occurrence rate of massive , long - period companions as a function of inner - planet semi - major axis .",
    "we divided the total sample up into three bins - systems with planets interior to 0.1 au ( hot gas giants ) , systems with planets between 0.1 and 1 au ( warm gas giants ) , and systems with planets between 1 and 5 au ( cold gas giants ) .",
    "for each bin , we repeated our fits to derive new values of @xmath557 , @xmath558 , and @xmath559 , which we integrated over a range of @xmath619 @xmath1 and 5 - 20 au .",
    "our results are presented in figure 19 .",
    "the hot gas giant companion frequency is 2.4@xmath284 higher than that of the warm gas giants , and 2.3@xmath284 higher than that of the cold gas giants .",
    "this suggests that gas giants with orbital semi - major axes interior to 0.1 au may have a higher companion fraction than their long - period counterparts , albeit with the caveat that this short - period bin is dominated by our transiting hot jupiter sample .",
    "these planets typically have fewer radial velocity measurements than planets detected using the radial velocity technique , which could result in an underestimate of the stellar jitter for these stars .",
    "if this enhanced companion fraction for short - period planets is confirmed by future studies , it would suggest that three body interactions may be an important mechanism for hot jupiter migration .",
    "alternatively , this trend might also result from differences in the properties of the protoplanetary disks in these systems .",
    "if we suppose that each disk that successfully generates gas giant planets produces them at some characteristic radius ( e.g. the ice line - see @xcite ) separated by some time span , and these planets subsequently migrate inwards via type ii migration .",
    "gas giants that migrate early in the disk s lifetime will reach the inner magnetospheric cavity of the disk , and due to eccentricity excitation mechanisms ( rice et al ( 2008 ) ) , will rapidly accrete onto the host star over a timescale that is short compared to the lifetime of the disk . as the disk ages however , photoevaporation will grow the radius of the inner disk cavity . accordingly ,",
    "for those gas giants that arrive later in the lifetime of the disk , the inner disk edge will have been eaten away to the point that the eccentricity excitation mechanisms are no longer effective at shepherding the planets into the host stars , allowing migration to halt .",
    "we note that there is a very narrow window of time where the aforementioned processes allow for a successful formation of a hot jupiter ( which may self - consistently explain their inherent rarity - see @xcite ) .",
    "we would thus expect hot jupiters to form primarily around stars that hosted disks that were especially efficient at giant planet formation , thus increasing the chances of having a planet reach the inner disk edge during the small window of time where hot jupiter formation is possible .",
    "these highly efficient disks would also be expected to produce more than one gas giant planet , which leads to the expectation that hot jupiters would be more likely to have companions .    , @xmath623 , and @xmath624.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we also calculated the occurrence rate of companions as a function of inner planet mass .",
    "we divided the sample up into three bins , corresponding to planets with masses between 0.05 and 0.5 @xmath1 , @xmath625 @xmath1 , and @xmath626 @xmath1 .",
    "our results are plotted in figure 20 .",
    "we find that intermediate mass planets may be more likely to have a massive , long - period companion , although all three bins are consistent at the 2@xmath284 level .",
    "we note that our ability to discern trends in companion rate as a function of planet mass is limited by the relatively small sample sizes in the lowest and highest mass bins , which result in correspondingly large uncertainties on their companion rates .    , @xmath627 , and @xmath628.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we calculated the occurrence rate of companions outside of 5 au as a function of stellar mass . once again , we divided the sample up into three bins - systems with stellar masses from 0.08 - 0.8 @xmath501 ( m and k stars ) , 0.8 - 1.4 @xmath501 ( g and f stars ) , and 1.4 - 2.1 @xmath501 ( a stars ) .",
    "our results are plotted in figure 21 .",
    "we find that the occurrence rates for each stellar mass bin are consistent with each other at the @xmath629 level .",
    "earlier studies indicated that the occurrence rate for gas giant planets interior to 3 au is higher around a stars than f and g stars @xcite ; our results for companions beyond 5 au suggest that these differences may be reduced at large orbital separations , albeit with large uncertainties due to the small number of a stars included in our sample .",
    "we note that while mass estimates for the evolved a stars have been debated in the literature @xcite , this has a minimal impact on our conclusions in this study as we find that these evolved stars have the same frequency of companions as the main sequence fgkm stars in our sample .    , @xmath630 , and @xmath631.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      in addition to the results described above , we also seek to quantify how the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets in single planet systems might differ from that of exoplanets in two planet systems or systems with an outer body , as indicated by a radial velocity trend .",
    "we quantify these differences by fitting the set of inner planet eccentricities for each sample using the beta distribution @xcite :    @xmath632    we account for the uncertainties in the measured eccentricities for each planet by repeating our beta distribution fit 10,000 times , where each time we draw a random eccentricity from the mcmc posterior probability distribution for each individual planet .",
    "the resulting distributions of best - fit @xmath633 and @xmath634 values therefore reflect both the measured eccentricities and their uncertainties .",
    "figure 22 plots the distribution of best - fit eccentricities for the two groups of planets .",
    "we excluded planets interior to 0.1 au whose eccentricities might be circularized due to tidal forces from the primary star from this plot as well as the beta distribution fits .",
    "figure 23 compares the two - dimensional posterior probability distributions in @xmath633 and @xmath634 for each of the two groups , taking into account the uncertainties on each planet eccentricity .",
    "we find that the two - planet systems appear to have systematically higher eccentricities than their single planet counterparts , with a significance greater than 3@xmath284 .",
    "this result appears to contradict previous studies , which found that multi - planet systems have lower eccentricities @xcite .",
    "this difference may be explained if the separation between inner and outer planets is larger for cases where the inner planet has a large orbital eccentricity .",
    "previous surveys were typically only sensitive to a 1 @xmath1 planet out to 3 - 5 au , suggesting that many of the multi - planet systems detected by our survey would have been misclassified as single planet systems .",
    "the most detailed study of this correlation to date was presented in @xcite .",
    "this study used 403 cataloged rv exoplanets from exoplanet.org @xcite to determine a relationship between eccentricity and system multiplicity .",
    "127 of these planets were members of known multi - planet systems , with up to six planets in each system .",
    "when the authors calculated the mean eccentricity as a function of the number of planets in each system , they found that systems with more planets had lower eccentricities .",
    "we note that the difference between our new study and this one may be due to the fact that the majority of their planets have relatively short orbital periods . for systems with three or more planets , this means that the spacing between planets is typically small enough to require less eccentric orbits in order to ensure that the system remains stable over the lifetime of the system .",
    "furthermore , their analysis did not take into account the uncertainties on individual exoplanet eccentricities , which can be substantial .",
    "@xcite reaches a similar conclusion in their simpler analysis of published rv planets .",
    "this study compared eccentricity distributions of single giant planets to giant planets in multi - planet systems , and found that eccentricities of planets in multi - planet systems are lower on average .    because @xcite did not carry out their own fits to the radial velocity data",
    ", they did not consistently allow for the possibility of long - term radial velocity accelerations due to unresolved outer companions .",
    "previous studies by @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that undetected outer planets can systematically bias eccentricity estimates for the inner planet to larger values .",
    "this is also a problem for systems where the signal to noise of the planet detection is low or the data are sparsely sampled @xcite .",
    "although we use a smaller sample of planets for our study than @xcite , our systems all have high signal to noise detections and long radial velocity baselines , which we use to fit and remove long - term accelerations that might otherwise bias our eccentricity estimates .",
    "in contrast to these other studies , dong et al ( 2014 ) found that warm jupiters with companions have higher eccentricities than single warm jupiters . however , we note that this study relied on a relatively small sample of planets ( 9 systems with e @xmath635 0.4 and 17 with e @xmath636 0.2 ) , and the authors did not report uncertainties on their estimated occurrence rates for either sample . in this study",
    "the authors also point out that in order to migrate a warm jupiter inwards via dynamical interactions with an outer body , the perturber in question must be close enough to overcome gr precession of the inner planet .",
    "we use this constraint , presented in their equation 4 , to test this formation scenario for the warm jupiter population in our sample . of the 42 warm jupiter systems in our sample ,",
    "15 have resolved companions and 4 have statistically significant linear trends .",
    "we find that for the resolved companions , 13 out of the 15 companions satisfy the criterion for high - eccentricity migration ( namely that warm jupiters must reach a critical periastron distance of 0.1 au within a kozai - lidov oscillation ) .",
    "we take the best fit masses and semi - major axes for the companions causing the trends from their probability distributions , and use these values to calculate the upper limit on the separation ratio between the warm jupiter and the companion .",
    "we find that zero out of the four systems satisfy the criterion for high - e migration .",
    "combining the resolved and trend systems , 13 out of 19 warm jupiter systems with companions satisfy the criterion .",
    "however , we note that the criterion presented in dong et al ( 2014 ) is necessary but insufficient for high - eccentricity migration . while our observations in principle do not rule out kozai - lidov migration for the warm jupiter population , in order to decide if migration is relevant the character of the angular - momentum exchange cycle must be understood . in order to do this to lowest order",

    "we conducted a doppler survey at keck combined with nirc2 k - band ao imaging to search for massive , long period companions to a sample of 123 known one and two planet systems detected using the radial velocity method .",
    "these companions manifest as long term radial velocity trends in systems where the rv baseline is not long enough to resolve a full orbit .",
    "we extended archival rv baselines by up to 12 years for the stars in our sample , and found that 25 systems had statistically significant radial velocity trends , six of which displayed significant curvature ( hd 68988 , hd 50499 , hd 72659 , hd 92788 , hd 75898 , and hd 158038 ) .",
    "we found that trends detected in hd 1461 and hd 97658 correlxated with the ca ii h@xmath2k line strengths , indicating that these trends were likely due to stellar activity and not due to a wide - separation companion .",

    "we also checked each system for stellar companions , and found that hd 164509 , hd 126614 , and hd 195109 had stellar companions that could account for the linear rv accelerations .",
    "these systems were also removed from further analysis . for the remaining 20 trend systems",
    ", we placed lower limits on companion masses and semi - major axes from the rv trends , and upper limits from the ao contrast curves of the corresponding systems .",
    "we quantified the sensitivity of our survey and found that on average we were able to detect a 1 @xmath1 planet out to 20 au , and a saturn mass planet out to 8 au with @xmath553 completeness .",
    "we fit the companion probability distributions with a double power law in mass and semi - major axis , and integrated this power law to determine the giant planet companion occurrence rate .",
    "we found the total occurrence rate of companions over a mass range of 1 - 20 @xmath1 and semi - major axis range of 5 - 20 au to be @xmath620 , and obtained a comparable occurrence rate when the a and m star systems were removed from the calculation .",
    "the distribution of these long - period companions is best matched by models with a declining frequency as a function of increasing semi - major axis , and appears to be inconsistent with an extrapolation from fits to the population of gas giant planets interior to 3 au described in cumming et al .",
    "this suggests that either the radial distribution of gas giants peaks between 3 - 10 au , or that the distribution of outer gas giant companions differs from that of the overall gas giant population .",
    "when calculating the occurrence rate as a function of inner planet semi - major axis , we found that the hot gas giants were more likely to have a massive outer companion as compared to their cold gas giant counterparts .",
    "this result suggests that dynamical interactions between planets may be an important migration mechanism for gas giant planets .",
    "when we compared the eccentricity distributions of single planets in this sample with no outer bodies to planets in two - planet systems and single planets with a positive trend detection , we found that in multi - body systems , the eccentricity distribution was significantly higher than that of single planet systems with no outer bodies .",
    "the higher average eccentricities in these systems suggest that dynamical interactions between gas giant planets play a significant role in the evolution of these systems .",
    "if we wish to better understand the role that dynamical evolution plays in these systems , there are several possible approaches to consider .",
    "first , continued rv monitoring would help to better constrain companion orbits and masses .",
    "second , deep imaging of the trend systems could probe down to brown dwarf masses and determine whether any of the observed trends could be caused by stellar instead of planetary mass companions .",
    "if any brown dwarf companions are detected via direct imaging , the existence of complementary radial velocity data would allow us to dynamically measure their masses , which would provide a valuable test of stellar evolution models in the low mass regime @xcite .",
    "finally , long term rv monitoring of systems with lower mass planets and/or systems with three or more short period planets detected by transit surveys such as kepler could allow us to determine if the companion occurrence rate of these systems differs from that of their gas giant counterparts .",
    "a significant limitation of this last suggestion is the need to detect low mass planetary systems orbiting bright , nearby stars - most kepler stars are time consuming to observe with rvs , but k2 , and later tess , should provide a good sample of low mass planets orbiting nearby stars .",
