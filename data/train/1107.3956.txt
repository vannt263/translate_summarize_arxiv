    "few - body systems with large two - particle scattering length @xmath0 possess a number of universal properties that are independent of the short - range interaction details .",
    "the three - particle system is simple enough such that analytic or semi - analytic derivation ( at least of some ) of those properties is possible @xcite .",
    "probably the best - known example is the efimov effect , the existence of an infinite number of weakly bound trimers with geometric spectrum in the unitary limit @xmath1 @xcite . the four - particle system , however , is too complicated for analytic approaches and therefore so far has been investigated mostly numerically .",
    "while the bound state properties have been calculated by several methods @xcite , the description of the four - particle continuum still constitutes a serious technical challenge , especially in the universal regime with many open channels ; first studies have been made using the hyperspherical formalism @xcite . given the success of the four - nucleon scattering calculations @xcite based on exact alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite that were solved in momentum - space , we applied them recently also to bosonic atom - trimer scattering @xcite and established a number of universal relations between observables .",
    "in the present work we extend the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite to study the universal physics in the bosonic dimer - dimer scattering ; in our model only one ( shallow ) dimer state exists .",
    "we note that this problem has already been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite using the adiabatic hyperspherical framework .",
    "however , the ags method enables us to determine the universal properties with much higher accuracy ; in particular cases there are significant corrections to the results of ref .",
    "furthermore , we also present more detailed analysis of dimer - dimer scattering observables .",
    "a rigorous description of the four - particle scattering can be given by the faddeev - yakubovsky equations @xcite for the wave - function components or by the equivalent ags integral equations @xcite for the transition operators .",
    "the latter ones are better suitable for the multichannel scattering problem where the on - shell momenta and binding energies of the asymptotic states differ by many orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ags equations lead more directly to the observables since the on - shell matrix elements of the transition operators calculated between the components of the corresponding initial and final channel states yield scattering amplitudes @xcite . for the system of four identical bosons we use the symmetrized form of the ags equations . in the case of the atom - trimer scattering",
    "they are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas for the dimer - dimer scattering they read    [ eq : u ] @xmath2    the transition operator @xmath3 describes the elastic scattering and @xmath4 the transfer reactions leading to the final atom - trimer states .",
    "the dynamic input is the two - boson potential @xmath5 .",
    "it yields the two - boson transition matrix @xmath6 and the symmetrized transition operators @xmath7 with @xmath8 and 2 for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 subsystems , respectively . in the above equations @xmath11 is the free resolvent for the four - boson system with energy @xmath12 and kinetic energy operator @xmath13 .",
    "the permutation operators @xmath14 of particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 and their combinations @xmath17 and @xmath18 are sufficient to ensure the correct symmetry of the four - boson system when a special choice of the basis states is used @xcite .",
    "namely , the basis states must be symmetric under exchange of particles 1 and 2 ; in addition , for the 2 + 2 subsystem they must be symmetric also under exchange of particles 3 and 4 .",
    "we employ momentum - space partial - wave framework @xcite to solve the ags equations . after the discretization of momentum",
    "variables the system of integral equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations whose dimension is significantly reduced by using a separable two - boson potential @xmath19 of rank 1 acting in the @xmath20 wave only .",
    "nevertheless , higher angular momentum states with @xmath21 ( see ref .  @xcite for the notation ) are taken into account for the relative motion in @xmath22 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 subsystems such that the results are converged to at least four - digit accuracy with respect to the partial - wave expansion .    to prove that our results are indeed independent of the short - range details of the interaction , we use two different choices of the potential form factor @xmath23e^{-(k/\\lambda)^2}$ ] with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that they yield a very different trimer ground state and related observables , but , nevertheless , lead to the same universal relations for the atom collisions with highly excited trimers where the finite - range corrections become negligible .",
    "we study the dimer - dimer scattering observables as functions of the atom - atom scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "we fix the geometry of the potential , i.e. , the cutoff parameter @xmath26 , whereas the strength @xmath27 is adjusted to reproduce the desired value of @xmath0 .",
    "we present the results as dimensionless ratios that are independent of @xmath26 and particle mass @xmath28 .",
    "schematic representation of the four - boson energy spectrum ; only one family ( @xmath29 ) of multimers is shown .",
    "the tetramer ( t ) energies , atom - trimer ( a+t ) , dimer - dimer ( d+d ) , and dimer - atom - atom ( d+a+a ) thresholds are displayed as solid , dashed , dashed - dotted , and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "they intersect at special values of @xmath0 described in the text . for a better visualization",
    "only qualitative relations are preserved . ]    a schematic @xmath0-dependence of the energy levels and thresholds in the four - boson system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] . as a reference point for @xmath0",
    "we choose the intersection of the dimer - dimer and @xmath29th atom - trimer thresholds , i.e. , @xmath30 at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the binding energies of the dimer and the @xmath29th trimer , respectively . a point important for three - boson physics is @xmath34 where the @xmath29th trimer is at the atom - dimer threshold , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , the existence of two tetramers ( @xmath36 ) associated with each efimov trimer was predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite . except for the lowest two ,",
    "all other tetramers lie above the trimer ground state ( @xmath37 ) and therefore are unstable bound states @xcite with finite width @xmath38 ; their position relative to the four free particle threshold is @xmath39 . at @xmath40",
    "the corresponding tetramer intersects the dimer - dimer threshold , i.e. , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , leading to resonant effects in the low - energy dimer - dimer scattering . the relations between these special @xmath0 values are collected in table  [ tab : a ] for @xmath43 and 4 ; to achieve the universal limit with good accuracy we concentrate on the regime with @xmath29 and @xmath0 large enough , @xmath44 ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the differences between the results obtained with @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the potential form factor are below 0.3% in the @xmath43 case and below 0.015% in the @xmath47 case .",
    "in addition we include @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath29th trimer binding energy in the unitary limit .",
    "the agreement between our predictions and the semi - analytical result @xmath50 given in ref .",
    "@xcite is of the same quality as for other ratios in table  [ tab : a ] , i.e. , it is better than 0.015% in the @xmath47 case .",
    "we therefore conclude that our @xmath47 calculations provide the universal results for dimer - dimer collisions with high accuracy ,    [ eq : ar - n ] @xmath51    the errors are estimated from the residual dependence on @xmath52 and included @xmath53 .",
    "the above ratios calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite with local potential at @xmath54 are 0.352 , 0.981 , and 6.73 , respectively .",

    "@xmath20-wave ( @xmath85 ) results depend strongly on @xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] for few specific @xmath0 values .",
    "we remind that the standard effective range expansion is not valid in the case of coinciding thresholds @xmath86 . a very rapid decrease of @xmath87 at @xmath86",
    "is caused by the proximity of the @xmath88 unstable tetramer . at @xmath89",
    "the cusp in @xmath87 and the descent of @xmath90 correspond to the opening of the @xmath29th atom - trimer channel . due to centrifugal barrier these features",

    "@xmath93 are small but , depending on @xmath0 , can be of both signs , while @xmath94 deviate from 1 quite significantly as @xmath83 increases .",
    "thus , near @xmath95 the @xmath91-wave contribution to the inelastic cross section may exceed the one of the @xmath20 wave , the ratio being @xmath96 .",
    "higher waves can be neglected in the considered energy regime @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "the cross sections for the dimer - dimer elastic scattering @xmath100 and transfer / rearrangement reactions @xmath101 leading to an atom plus trimer in the @xmath102th state are shown in fig .  [",

    "the exception is @xmath105 in the case of coinciding thresholds @xmath86 where the increase slows down until @xmath105 becomes almost constant at @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the very low energy behavior of the cross sections is consistent with the wigner threshold law .",
    "the reason why for @xmath86 the region of nearly constant @xmath100 and @xmath105 is so narrow is the proximity of the @xmath88 unstable tetramer . the inelastic scattering , apart from the very narrow regions just above the atom - trimer thresholds , is dominated by the open channel with the shallowest trimer ; the reactions leading to more deeply bound trimers are strongly suppressed .",
    "the elastic cross section appears to be remarkably sensitive to the atom - atom scattering length .",
    "for example , @xmath106 corresponds to @xmath107 leading to an almost constant @xmath100 at @xmath108 while for @xmath109 where @xmath110 the elastic cross section is very small at @xmath111 but then increases with energy , in contrast to the other shown cases .",
    "furthermore , the opening of the @xmath29th atom - trimer channel affects the elastic dimer - dimer cross section in opposite ways for @xmath106 and 0.951 .",
    "the above results are indispensable for the description of the dimer - trimer conversion process , i.e. , the creation of efimov trimers via rearrangement reaction in a gas of dimers .",
    "the total trimer creation rate in the dimer - dimer scattering @xmath112 has contributions from all open atom - trimer channels , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the relative dimer - dimer velocity and @xmath115 denotes the thermal average . at vanishing temperature the trimer creation rate @xmath116 is determined by the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : add ] ; thus , it gets resonantly enhanced around @xmath40 . the results at finite temperature @xmath117 , assuming the boltzmann distribution for the relative dimer - dimer energy , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlx ] for few selected values of @xmath0 .",
    "the shown examples differ remarkably in their @xmath117 dependence : at very low temperatures @xmath118 decreases with @xmath117 very rapidly at the resonance @xmath119 while in other cases its variation is considerably slower . a more pronounced increase of @xmath118 at higher temperature for @xmath106 and 0.951 is due to the opening of the @xmath29th atom - trimer channel .",
    "we do not show predictions for individual @xmath120 , but the results of fig .",
