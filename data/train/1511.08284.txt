    "* supplementary note 1 : systematic evolution of the band structure under strain * + as mentioned in the main text , the hgte - class materials which carry t@xmath15 point group symmetry , do not respect inversion symmetry .",
    "the inversion asymmetry in these systems results in qualitatively different band structures compared to those with inversion symmetry , e.g. , @xmath92-sn . instead of a simple quadratic band touching point ( at @xmath2 ) exactly at fermi level , two intermediate bands of the four @xmath1 bands in hgte - class materials touch along a line node in the six mirror planes .",
    "these line nodes are protected by mirror symmetry even though they are generically away from the fermi level . as a consequence ,",
    "the hgte - class materials have small electron and hole pockets , even at stoichiometry .",
    "to illustrate these line nodes , we diagonalize hamiltonian in the mirror plane , e.g. , the @xmath49 plane as shown by the shaded plane in supplementary figure 1*a*. the unstrained hamiltonian is given in the main text , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "for simplicity , only the linear term in @xmath94 is taken into consideration and higher - order terms in @xmath94 wo nt affect the results we obtain in this section qualitatively .",
    "the line nodes lying in the @xmath49 mirror plane is given by the following equation : 2(c_1 ^ 2-c_2 ^ 2 ) k_z^2 - 3|^2 - 2 c_1 ^ 2 k_z^2| + ( 2c_2 ^ 2 - 8c_1 ^ 2 ) k_y^2 + 3 ^2 = 0 .",
    "where @xmath95 is defined in supplementary note 3 .",
    "this bow - shape line node is shown in supplementary figure [ line_node]*a * by a green line .",
    "there are six symmetry - related mirror planes and each of them contains such a bow - shape line node .",
    "two line nodes overlap each other along the diagonal direction where their mirror planes intersect , as indicated by the black lines in supplementary figure [ line_node]*b*. since the system has a c@xmath96 symmetry along the diagonal direction , the two intermediate bands form a two - dimensional irreducible representation that explains the overlaps of two line nodes along this direction .",
    "the red , blue or green lines in supplementary figure [ line_node]*b * indicate the parts of the line nodes not along the diagonal directions .    upon applying strain in the @xmath17 plane ,",
    "the crystalline symmetry of the material is lowered from t@xmath15 to d@xmath16 .",
    "the mirror symmetries in the @xmath97 and @xmath98 planes are broken , while those in @xmath25 planes survive . as a result , for small strain the line nodes located at @xmath25 plane survive as they are protected by the unbroken mirror symmetry , even though they contract as the applied strain increases .",
    "the evolution of the line nodes is shown in supplementary figure [ line_node]*c * where the closed green lines indicate the shrinking line nodes under a small strain .",
    "when the applied strain exceeds critical value , these line nodes eventually disappear .    on the other hand ,",
    "the line nodes in @xmath97 and @xmath98 planes are split immediately , upon applying strain except the eight discrete points .",
    "these eight discrete points are the intersecting points between the @xmath27 ( @xmath26 ) plane and the line nodes in the @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) planes , as shown by red or blue color points in supplementary figure [ line_node]*b*. as mentioned in the main text , these eight discrete points are protected from gapping out by c@xmath99 c@xmath100 symmetries .",
    "applying strain only gradually shift these points in the @xmath27 or @xmath26 planes .",
    "supplementary figure [ line_node]*c * shows these discrete points upon applying a small strain .",
    "these eight discrete points are actually weyl points , which reside in the @xmath26 or @xmath27 planes protected by the c@xmath101 symmetry ( see supplementary note 3 for details ) .    when the strain is sufficiently small but finite , these points are type - ii weyl points .",
    "these type - ii weyl points in the @xmath27 plane shift to @xmath102 region if compressive strain is applied while they shift to @xmath103 region if tensile strain is applied , and weyl points in the @xmath26 have the similar behavior related by symmetry .",
    "thanks to this qualitatively different response between tensile and compressive strain , the system evolve into different phases at sufficiently large strain .",
    "when the tensile strain increases , these type - ii weyl points first move to the @xmath104 or @xmath105 axis in the @xmath47 plane , then move within the @xmath47 plane ( since there is c@xmath101 symmetry in the @xmath47 plane ) , and finally they annihilate one another with opposite chiralities in @xmath106 lines when the tensile strain reaches a critical value .",
    "when the strain exceeds the critical value , the system enters into a strong topological insulator phase with nontrivial @xmath50 topological - invariant .    on the other hands ,",
    "when the compressive strain increases from zero , the eight type - ii weyl nodes shift towards a larger @xmath107 direction .",
    "when the compressive strain exceeds a critical value , all trivial fermi surface vanishes and the eight type - ii weyl nodes evolve to type - i ideal weyl nodes located exactly at the fermi level , as shown in supplementary figure [ line_node]*d*. + * supplementary note 2 : the weyl nodes under different strains * + in this section , we calculate locations of ideal weyl nodes for different in - plane compressive strains for both hgte and the half - heusler compound laptbi , as shown in supplementary table 1 .",
    "the weyl nodes move slowly towards larger momentum points in both @xmath104 and @xmath41 directions for increasing strain .",
    "as the weyl nodes can only be pair - annihilated in the @xmath108 plane , the slow motion of weyl nodes with increasing strain indicates that the ideal weyl semimetal phase is stable under a broad range of strain . indeed , for the large strain of @xmath109 and @xmath110 ,",
    "the weyl nodes are still far away from the @xmath108 plane . moreover , the larger separation between weyl nodes in momentum space under increasing in - plane compressive strain can make the observation of them by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments easier . + * supplementary note 3 : the effective k@xmath34p theory at finite strain * + in this section , we use following gamma matrices @xcite : ^1= \\{j_y , j_z } ,   ^2= \\{j_z , j_x } ,   ^3= \\{j_x , j_y } , ^4 = ( j_x^2- j_y^2 ) ,   ^5= j_z^2- to write the luttinger hamiltonian : _ ( * k * ) = c_0 * k*^2+c_1 _ i=1 ^ 3 d_i ^i + c_2 _",
    "i=4 ^ 5 d_i ^i , where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "now , we explore the behavior of hgte under sufficiently large strain ( exceeds the critical value @xmath119 ) using the effective * k*@xmath34*p * theory . from clebsch - gordan coefficients ,",
    "we know |32,32&= & |p_x+ip_y , ,  |32,-32= |p_x - ip_y , , +    @xmath120 labels the wave function of a single electron with @xmath121 .",
    "electrons with @xmath122 have definite orbital angular momentum @xmath123 while electrons with @xmath124 are superpositions of the wave functions with @xmath123 and @xmath125 . since compressive strain in the @xmath17 plane shortens the lattice distance along the @xmath30 and @xmath31 directions , the wave functions with orbital angular momentum @xmath123 get more overlapped than that of @xmath125 , and their energy shift is larger than that of @xmath125 .",
    "this indicates that the main effect induced by the strain in the @xmath17 plane is given by the following perturbation : _ &",
    "= & - g ( j_z^2 - 54)= -g^5 , where @xmath19 is related to the strength of applied strain @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , we obtain @xmath22 for compressive strain ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath21 for tensile strain ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we shall focus on the case that @xmath127 here . for this case , as explained in the main text , treating @xmath128 as unperturbed hamiltonian and the bia part @xmath129 as perturbation is a better way to characterize the band features around weyl nodes .",
    "the quadratic touching point in luttinger hamiltonian @xmath130 is split into two dirac points locating at @xmath41 axis for compressive strain because @xmath131 has only d@xmath132 symmetry which is lower than the o@xmath133 symmetry of the luttinger hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , the dispersion is given by @xmath134 , leading to two dirac points at @xmath135 .",
    "expanding the hamiltonian around the touching point @xmath136 , we obtain the dirac hamiltonian : _",
    "( * k * ) & & v_z k_z+ v_(k_y ^1 + k_x ^2 ) + v_z k_z ^5 , [ dirac ] where @xmath137 .",
    "these dirac points are protected by inversion symmetry , time reversal symmetry , as well as the s@xmath138 symmetry of @xmath139 . in hgte ,",
    "inversion symmetry is actually broken which has important consequences even though the breaking is weak . as a result of bia , linear , cubic , as well as",
    "higher - order terms compatible with the t@xmath15 symmetry are allowed in the hamiltonian and we treat them as perturbations .",
    "we first consider the effect of the linear term in @xmath129@xcite : _ & = & . for simplicity , we approximate @xmath140 by its form at the dirac point @xmath136 and denote it as @xmath141 , where @xmath142 . in the presence of @xmath143 , the low - energy dispersion is given by @xmath144 .",
    "it is easy to see that the dirac points are split and lead to two doubly degenerate line nodes satisfying the two equations : @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in general , line nodes in 3d momentum space",
    "are not stable against further generic perturbations .",
    "for instance , the cubic term in @xmath129 given by @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is a constant that describes the strength of cubic term , can split the line nodes .",
    "interestingly , eight discrete gapless points , which are the crossing points of original line nodes with the @xmath26 or @xmath27 plane , survive from generic perturbations in @xmath129 .",
    "these stable gapless discrete points in the @xmath26 or @xmath27 plane are protected by a special symmetry c@xmath149c@xmath100 that forms little group of these planes which we shall explain below .",
    "we now consider the @xmath27 plane to explain how its c@xmath101 symmetry can protect a gapless weyl point in this plane .",
    "the @xmath27 plane respects the c@xmath101 symmetry which is given by _ 2 t e^-ij_y e^ij_y k = k , where @xmath150 is the complex conjugation operator , an anti - unitary transformation . after expanding the hamiltonian ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath151 , at one of the four crossing points @xmath152 in the @xmath27 plane , we obtain an effective hamiltonian : ( * k*)=v_z k_z+ v_(k_x ^2+k_y ^1)+ v_z k_z ^5 + m(^2 + ^35 ) .",
    "since two intermediate bands of four bands touches , we implement a unitary transformation @xmath153 that diagonalizes @xmath154 and @xmath155 simultaneously to project the hamiltonian to those bands .",
    "the resultant hamiltonian in the @xmath27 plane reads ( @xmath156 ) : _",
    "u(k_y=0 ) = ( -v_k_x - 2 m & v_z k_z & 0 & 0 + v_z k_z & v_k_x + 2 m & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & v_z k_z & - v_k_x + 0 & 0 & -v_k_x & -v_z k_z ) , which has a simple block - diagonal form .",
    "it is easy to see that the low - energy sector is given by second block and it can be written compactly as : _u(k_y=0)= v_z k_z ^z- v_k_x ^x .",
    "moreover , the c@xmath101 operator does not change after this unitary transformation , i.e. @xmath157 .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the gapless point locating at @xmath27 plane is protected : any gap - opening term proportional to @xmath158 is not allowed because it breaks the c@xmath101 symmetry .",
    "namely , because the hamiltonian respects this special c@xmath101 symmetry , the eight weyl points in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 planes are stable against all possible bia and strain perturbations if they are not too strong .",
    "these perturbations can only shift these weyl points in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 plane .",
    "we now include the cubic term @xmath159 $ ] in @xmath160 to obtain the effective hamiltonian of the weyl points with dispersions away from the c@xmath101-planes .",
    "expanding it at the gapless point @xmath152 , we obtain a linear term in @xmath105 : @xmath161 , where @xmath5 is the angular momentum operator , and @xmath162 . projecting this linear terms into the low - energy subspace of two intermediate bands around the gapless weyl point , we obtain the weyl hamiltonian : _ & = & _ i v_i k_i ^i . where @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 and it is exactly the weyl hamiltonian appeared in the main text . for hgte , we find that the velocity @xmath166 is negative because @xmath167 .",
    "so this weyl node is right - handed as mentioned in the main text ."

    "<S> the fermi arc originating from the point ( @xmath81 ) and terminating at the point ( @xmath82 ) spans across a significant portion of the bz ( about @xmath83 of reciprocal lattice constant ) , which is of great advantage for experimental detection such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi arc pattern may change upon varying chemical environment on the surface , but the parity of number of fermi arcs is topologically stable .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of realizing ideal weyl fermions in strained hgte leads to a general guiding principle to search for ideal weyl semimetals in noncentrosymmetric materials with nontrivial band inversion . </S>",
    "<S> noncentrosymmetric half - heusler compounds with band inversion are another family of such materials which could also realize ideal weyl semimetals under a compressive in - plane strain . for illustration , we perform first - principles calculations on laptbi ( fig .  4*a * ) with a compressive in - plane strain of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it also shows eight ideal weyl nodes at ( @xmath58 ) and ( @xmath59 ) with @xmath84@xmath61 and @xmath85@xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to hgte , the surface fermi arcs also forms a closed loop in the ( 001 ) surface bz , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we have shown that applying in - plane strain in hgte - class materials can give rise to ideal weyl semimetals with only four pairs of weyl nodes exactly locating at the fermi level . experimentally , </S>",
    "<S> such strain in the @xmath17 plane may be effectively obtained by growing samples on substrates with a smaller lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> for example , materials with zinc - blende structure such as gasb , inas , cdse , znte , and hgse are promising substrates for growing hgte to achieve the desired in - plane compressive strain . </S>",
    "<S> the locations of weyl nodes for various strength of strains in hgte and laptbi are calculated and summarized in supplementary table 1 ( see also supplementary note 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted weyl nodes and surface fermi arcs can be directly verified by arpes measurements . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , transport experiments can be used to detect unusual bulk magneto - transport properties induced by the chiral anomaly of ideal weyl fermions@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ideal weyl semimetals predicted in the strained hgte - class materials are interesting on their own . </S>",
    "<S> it further provides a perfect platform to study the interplay between ideal weyl fermions and other exotic phenomena , especially in half - heusler compounds , including superconductivity in laptbi@xcite , magnetism in gdptbi , and heavy fermion behaviour in ybptbi@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , spacetime supersymmetry may also emerge at the superconducting quantum critical point in ideal weyl fermions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this class of ideal weyl semimetals thus opens a broad avenue for fundamental research of emergent physics as well as potential applications of low - power quantum devices . </S>",
    "<S> + * methods *    * the first - principles calculations . * </S>",
    "<S> the first - principle calculations are carried out in the framework of the perdew - burke - ernzerhof - type generalized gradient approximation of the density functional theory through employing the bstate package@xcite with the plane - wave pseudo - potential method . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy cutoff is fixed to 340ev , and the * k*-point mesh is taken as 16@xmath8616@xmath8616 for the bulk calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit coupling is self - consistently included . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental lattice constants are used with @xmath87  for hgte and 6.829  for laptbi . in order to simulate the uniaxial strain along the [ 001 ] direction </S>",
    "<S> , we fix the experimental volume but change the ration @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the lattice constant in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane and @xmath90 is the lattice constant along @xmath91 axis ( the [ 001 ] direction ) . without loss of generality , we take the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the tensile strain and @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the compressive strain . to exhibit unique surface states and fermi arcs on the surface , </S>",
    "<S> we employ maximally localized wannier functions@xcite to first obtain the _ ab initio _ tight - binding model of the bulk hgte and laptbi and then pick these bulk hopping parameters to construct the tight - binding model of the semi - infinite system with the ( 001 ) or ( 010 ) surface as the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the surface green s function of the semi - infinite system , whose imaginary part is the local density of states to obtain the dispersion of the surface states , can be calculated through an iterative method@xcite .    </S>",
