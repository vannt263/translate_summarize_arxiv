    "therefore , optimality is with respect to neighboring trajectories , independently of the values of the associated controls .",
    "in particular , if the extremal is abnormal , we prove that @xmath12 is isolated among admissible trajectories .",
    "we recall that a control @xmath13 ( a trajectory @xmath14 ) is bang - bang if there is a finite number of switching times @xmath15 such that each component @xmath16 of the reference control @xmath13 is constantly either @xmath17 or @xmath18 on each interval @xmath19 .",
    "a switching time @xmath20 is called _ simple _ if only one control component changes value at @xmath20 , while it is called _ multiple _ if at least two control components change value .",
    "second order conditions for the optimality of a bang - bang extremal with simple switches only are given in @xcite and references therein , while in @xcite the author gives sufficient conditions , in the case of the minimum time problem , for @xmath21-local optimality - an intermediate condition between strong and local optimality - of a bang - bang extremal having both simple and multiple switches with the extra assumption that the lie brackets of the switching vector fields is annihilated by the adjoint covector .",
    "all the above cited papers require regularity assumptions on the switches ( see the subsequent assumptions [ ass:1 ] , [ ass:2 ] and [ ass:3 ] which are the natural strengthening of necessary conditions ) and the positivity of a suitable second variation .    here",
    "we consider the problem of strong local optimality in the case of a mayer problem , when at most one double switch occurs , but there are finitely many simple ones and no commutativity assumptions on the involved vector fields . more precisely we extend the conditions in @xcite by requiring the sufficient second order conditions for the finite dimensional sub - problems that are obtained by allowing the switching times to move .",
    "the addition of a double switch is not a trivial extension of the known single - switch cases .",
    "in fact , as explained in section 2.2 , any perturbation of the switching time ( of a double switch ) of the components of @xmath22 generically creates two simple switches , that is it a _ bang _ arc is generated . on the contrary , the small perturbations of a single switch do not change the structure of the reference control .",
    "we believe that the techniques employed here could be extended to the more general case when there are more than one double switch .",
    "however , such an extension may not be straightforward as the technical and notational complexities grow quickly with the number of double switches .",
    "preliminary results were given in @xcite , where the authors exploit a study case and in @xcite that deals with a bolza problem in the so - called _ non - degenerate case_. also stability analysis under parameter perturbations for this kind of bang - bang extremals was studied in @xcite .",
    "we point out that , while in the case of simple switches the only variables are the switching times , each time a double switch occurs one has to consider the two possible combinations of the switching controls .",
    "the investigation of the invertibility of the involved lipschitz continuous , piecewise @xmath23 operators has been done via some topological methods described in the appendix , or via clarke s implicit function theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 7.1.1 . ) ) in some particular degenerate case .",

    "we introduce a finite dimensional subproblem of and its `` second variations '' ( indeed this subproblem is @xmath24 but not @xmath9 so that the classical `` second variation '' is not well defined ) .",
    "the essence of the paper will be to show that the sufficient conditions for the optimality of an extremum of this subproblem are actually sufficient also for the optimality of the reference pair @xmath25 in problem . in section 3",
    "we briefly describe the hamiltonian methods the proof is based upon .",
    "section 4 contains the maximized halmiltonian of the control system and its flow . in section 5 ,",
    "we write the `` second variations '' of the finite - dimensional subproblem and study their sign on appropriate spaces .",
    "section 6 is the heart of the paper and constitutes its more original contribution ; here we prove that the the projection onto a neighborhood of the graph of @xmath26 in @xmath27 of the maximized flow defined in section 4 is invertible ( which is necessary for our hamiltonian methods to work ) .",
    "section 7 contains the conclusion of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] . in the appendix we treat from an abstract viewpoint the problem , raised in section 6 , of local invertibility of a piecewise @xmath23 function",
    "the result is based on some regularity assumption on the vector fields associated to the problem and on a second order condition for a finite dimensional sub - problem .",
