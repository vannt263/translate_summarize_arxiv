    "moreover , since the curve @xmath616 passes the cusp @xmath509 , the curve @xmath616 does not corresponds to any shimura curves .",
    "then , we shall identify the curves @xmath629 and @xmath631 . because we have example [ exap5,12 ]",
    ", the divisor @xmath634 contains the shimura curves @xmath628 and @xmath635 .",
    "so , of the two curves @xmath629 and @xmath631 , one corresponds to @xmath628 and the other corresponds to @xmath635 .",
    "by the way , according to example [ exap5,21 ] , only the shimura curve @xmath636 is contained in the divisor @xmath637 .",
    "moreover , due to the next lemma , the curve @xmath631 is an irreducible component of @xmath638 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the curve @xmath629 ( @xmath631 , resp . ) gives the explicit model of the shimura curve @xmath628 , ( @xmath635 , resp . ) .",
    "the curve @xmath631 is a irreducible component of the divisor @xmath639 .    using the notation in ( [ ( abcdxy ) ] ) and ( [ abcd21 ] ) , we set @xmath640 we take the weighted homogeneous ideal @xmath641 in the ring @xmath642 $ ] .",
    "the zero set of the ideal @xmath643\\ ] ] gives the curve @xmath644 .",
    "however , because of a huge amount of calculations of the grbner basis , it is very difficult to obtain a system of generators of the ideal @xmath645 directly .    instead",
    ", we shall consider the ideal @xmath646.\\ ] ] by a computer aided calculation , we can show that the ideal @xmath647 is a principal ideal generated by @xmath648    next , taking a factor @xmath649 of ( [ genersq ] ) , we consider the new ideal @xmath650 the zero set @xmath651 of the elimination ideal @xmath652\\ ] ] corresponds to certain components of @xmath638 . by a computer aided calculation , we can compute the grbner basis of the ideal @xmath653 .",
