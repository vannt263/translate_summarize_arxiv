    "in the last few decades there has been considerable interest in the nature of the phase diagram of the two - dimensional ( 2-@xmath2 ) fully frustrated xy ( ffxy ) model , whose hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath3 here @xmath4 , the angle variables @xmath5 are defined on the sites of a regular 2-@xmath2 lattice , the summation is over nearest - neighbor pairs , and the quantities @xmath6 are fixed and satisfy the constraint @xmath7 around each plaquette .",
    "the ffxy model is experimentally relevant for josephson - junction arrays in a magnetic field .",
    "it should describe the superconducting - to - normal transition at half a flux quantum per plaquette , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    as a consequence of frustration",
    ", the ground state of the ffxy model presents an o(2)@xmath8 degeneracy @xcite . while the o(2 ) degeneracy is the usual one and is related to the o(2 ) global invariance of the hamiltonian that is broken in the low - temperature ( lt ) phase , the additional @xmath9 degeneracy @xcite .",
    "a variable that distinguishes the different ground states is the chirality @xcite , which is defined by @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a lattice plaquette and @xmath12 is the dual - lattice site at its center . at zero temperature",
    "there are two degenerate ground states related by a global flip of the chiral variables @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the staggered chirality magnetization defines an order parameter related to the chiral @xmath14 symmetry , which competes with the spin magnetization in determining the phase diagram and critical behavior of the ffxy model .",
    "much work has been dedicated to the study of the phase diagram of the ffxy and related models that have the same ground - state degeneracy . in spite of that",
    ", there is not yet a general consensus on the critical behavior of these systems . in this paper , we address again this issue and , by performing simulations on very large lattices and by means of a careful finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis of the results , we provide what we believe is the definite answer on this problem .",
    "two scenarios have been put forward for the critical behavior of the ffxy and related 2-@xmath2 models . in one of them",
    "the system undergoes two transitions as temperature decreases .",
    "first , chiral modes undergo an ising - type transition at @xmath15 , characterized by the onset of chiral long - range order while spins remain paramagnetic .",
    "then , at a lower temperature @xmath16 , spin modes exhibit a transition to a phase with quasi - long - range order , which coexists with the long - range order of the chiral modes .",
    "this second transition is expected to belong to the same universality class as the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition in the standard 2-@xmath2 xy model @xcite . in this scenario spin and chiral modes",
    "decouple and order at different temperatures .",
    "this scenario is supported by arguments based on a kink - antikink unbinding picture @xcite .",
    "a second possibility is that spin and chirality order at the same temperature , @xmath17 , where both chiral long - range order and spin quasi - long - range order set in simultaneously . in this case",
    "spin and chiral modes may be coupled at the transition and may give rise to a qualitatively new critical behavior .",
    "therefore , one may observe values of the chiral critical exponents that differ from the ising ones , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "field - theoretical calculations within the corresponding landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory @xcite support the existence of such a new universality class .",
    "previous results are presented in table  [ summaryliterature ] .",
    "we report results for the fully frustrated xy model on the square lattice ( ffxy@xmath20 ) and on the triangular lattice ( ffxy@xmath21 ) , and also for some generalizations : a model with next - to - nearest  neighbor interactions ( ffxy@xmath22 ) , a nearest - neighbor model with villain hamiltonian , and xy models in which frustration is induced by the competition of nearest - neighbor and next - to - nearest  neighbor interactions ( fxy@xmath23 ) or by a zig - zag pattern of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings ( fxy@xmath24 ) .",
    "we also include results for some related models that have the same ground - state degeneracy : the fractional - charge coulomb - gas ( cg ) model that is obtained from the ffxy model by the usual duality mapping , a model with two coupled xy fields ( 2cxy ) or with an ising and xy field ( isxy ) , the antiferromagnetic xxz model with easy - plane exchange anisotropy on the triangular lattice ( ffxxz@xmath21 ) , the frustrated antiferromagnetic six - state clock model on a triangular lattice ( fa6sc ) , the 19-vertex model , the quantum ladder of josephson junctions ( qljj ) , the solid - on - solid model coupled to the ising model ( sos - is ) , and the corresponding lgw @xmath25 theory . in table",
    "[ summaryliterature ] we report the method that has been employed to investigate the phase diagram , the number of transitions that are observed ( whenever there are two transitions , we also give the difference of the critical temperatures ) and the estimates of the critical exponents at the chiral transition .",
    "most of the results have been obtained by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "but we should also mention transfer - matrix ( tm ) and real - space renormalization - group ( rg ) calculations , as well as perturbative field - theoretical ( ft ) analyses .",
    "note that most mc studies focussed on the finite - size behavior at criticality ; only in a few cases @xcite was the temperature dependence investigated in the large - volume limit . in some cases",
    "the critical behavior was investigated by studying the nonequilibrium relaxation ( ner ) at criticality .",
    "the results summarized in table  [ summaryliterature ] are rather contradictory .",
    "the most recent mc simulations favor the existence of two transitions .",
    "if this is correct , the results of the mc simulations observing only one transition may be reasonably explained by noting that the two transitions are very close and that high accuracy is required to disentangle them .",
    "if there are two transitions , chiral and spin modes decouple and thus one expects ising behavior at the chiral transition .",
    "but this is not supported by numerical simulations that have found @xmath26 in most cases . to explain this result",
    ", one may conclude that there is a single transition that belongs to a new universality class . in this case , the observation of two very close transitions might be explained by uncontrolled systematic errors in the analysis of the mc data . of course , it is also possible , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the departure of the chiral exponents from the ising values is due to a slow crossover towards the ising asymptotic behavior , somehow caused by the interaction with the spin modes , which will eventually give rise to a kt transition .",
    "however , this argument does not explain why the same estimate @xmath26 is obtained in several different models .",
    "finally , there is a third , less conventional possibility : there are two transitions , but the chiral transition does not belong to the ising universality class for some unknown reasons .",

    "the @xmath14 chiral symmetry is broken and the spin degrees of freedom show the same quasi - long - range order as in the 2-@xmath2 xy model . we conclusively show that the square - lattice ffxy model undergoes two very close but separate transitions : a kt and then , as temperature increases , an ising transition with @xmath130 .",
    "the same transition pattern is observed in the @xmath25 and isxy models when the transitions are continuous .    beside confirming the two - transition scenario ,",
    "we have also observed an unexpected crossover behavior that is universal to some extent . in the ffxy model and in the @xmath25 and isxy models in a large parameter region , the finite - size behavior at the chiral and spin transitions is model independent , apart from a length rescaling . in particular , the universal approach to the ising regime at the chiral transition is nonmonotonic for most observables , and there is a wide region in which the finite - size behavior is controlled by an effective exponent @xmath131 .",

    "this universal behavior may be explained by the presence of a multicritical point , where chiral and spin modes are both critical . as far as its nature",

    "( as in the following models ) @xmath140 plays the role of inverse temperature , the gibbs probability being simply proportional to @xmath141 .",

    "where @xmath143 , @xmath144 is a real two - component variable , the first sum goes over all nearest - neighbor pairs , and @xmath145 .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath146 describes two identical o(2)-symmetric models coupled by an energy - energy term .",
    "this model is a straightforward lattice discretization of the lgw hamiltonian @xmath147 + { 1\\over 4!}u_0 \\bigl ( \\sum_{a=1,2 } \\phi_a^2\\bigr)^2 + { 1\\over 4 } v_0 \\phi_1 ^ 2 \\phi_2 ^ 2 \\bigr\\ } \\label{lgwh}\\ ] ] ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 , is a two - component vector ) , which can be obtained by applying a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to the ffxy model , dropping terms of order higher than four @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lattice @xmath25 model ( [ hli ] ) represents an effective ferromagnetic theory that is expected to describe the critical modes of the ffxy model .",
    "this approach was already used to investigate the critical behavior of antiferromagnets on a stacked triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the symmetry of hamiltonian ( [ hli ] ) is larger than that of the ffxy model .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian is symmetric under separate rotations of the two fields and under the @xmath14 transformation @xmath150 . therefore , the overall symmetry is [ o(2)@xmath151o(2)]@xmath152 .",
    "for @xmath153 the ground state corresponds to @xmath154 and @xmath155 or the opposite , and thus it has the same degeneracy as the ground state of the ffxy model .",
    "indeed , the lowest - energy configurations are determined once one fixes which field does not vanish  thereby breaking the @xmath14 interchange symmetry  and the direction of the nonvanishing one .",
    "thus , the relation between the ffxy model and the @xmath25 hamiltonian is not fixed by the symmetry of the original hamiltonian but rather by the ground - state degeneracy group , which is the quotient of the symmetry groups of the model and of the ground state .",
    "this is consistent with the paradigm that relates the universality class to the symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "note that the extended symmetry of the lgw hamiltonian is related to the truncation of the hamiltonian to fourth order in the fields and it is lost if higher - order terms are added .",
    "more precisely , the hubbard - stratonovich calculation gives rise to @xmath156 and @xmath157 terms on the triangular and square lattice respectively , which break the o(2)@xmath151o(2 ) symmetry down to o(2 ) @xcite .",
    "these terms are irrelevant close to four dimensions but it is far from clear that the same holds in two dimensions . in any case , they do not change the relevant symmetry breaking pattern .    due to the ground - state structure , for @xmath158 the field - interchange symmetry @xmath150 is broken and thus this symmetry is the analog of the @xmath14 chiral symmetry of the ffxy model .",
    "the corresponding order parameter is @xmath159 for @xmath160 model ( [ hli ] ) is o(4 ) symmetric .",
    "therefore , it does not have any transition at finite temperature .",
    "criticality is observed only for @xmath161 . in this limit",
    "the correlation length @xmath162 increases exponentially , i.e. @xmath163 ; see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "@xmath136 and @xmath166 correspond to spin and chiral variables , respectively .",
    "note that , by performing the limit @xmath167 and then @xmath168 in the @xmath25 model ( [ hli ] ) , one recovers the isxy model for @xmath124 . in this case",
    ", the variables @xmath166 and @xmath136 are related with those of the @xmath25 model by @xmath169 models with @xmath170 can also be recovered from a @xmath25 hamiltonian .",
    "it is enough to add an energy - energy nearest - neighbor hopping term @xmath171 .    apparently , the isxy model is only invariant under the group o(2)@xmath8",
    "however , its relation with the @xmath25 model indicates that the symmetry is larger .",
    "indeed , for any value of @xmath172 , the model is invariant under the o(2)@xmath151o(2 ) nonlinear transformations @xmath173 \\vec{s}_x , \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma'_x & = & \\sigma_x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are o(2 ) rotation matrices .",
    "it is possible to argue that in the isxy model chiral and spin modes can not be critical at the same value of @xmath140 and @xmath172 , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "let us assume that , for fixed @xmath172 , the model undergoes a continuous phase transition at @xmath176 , where the chiral correlation length is infinite , i.e. where @xmath177 correlations are critical .",
    "let us consider first the dynamics of the spins @xmath136 for a fixed ising @xmath178 configuration",
    ". spins @xmath177 with the same sign form geometrical clusters and spins @xmath136 belonging to different geometrical ( not fortuin - kasteleyn ) clusters do not interact ( either directly or indirectly ) because of the prefactor @xmath179 in the hopping term of the spin variables .",
    "thus , the behavior of the spins @xmath136 is completely determined by their behavior on each single cluster .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that @xmath180 is the percolation threshold of the clusters . indeed , if the clusters percolate at @xmath181 , for @xmath182 ising spins would already be critical , since in two dimensions percolation of the geometrical clusters implies ising criticality .",
    "now , at the percolation threshold we expect the clusters to have a fractal dimension that is smaller than 2 .",
    "this is true for the ising transition @xcite ; we assume here that it holds in general .",
    "thus , fields @xmath136 interact as on a system with @xmath183 and thus can not be critical .",
    "therefore , at the chiral transition the spin correlation length must be finite , and , moreover , @xmath184 .",
    "as we shall see , the mc results that we shall present provide support to this argument .",
