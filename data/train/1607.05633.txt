    "the distribution of the orbital parameters of the known extreme trans - neptunian objects or etnos is statistically incompatible with that of an unperturbed asteroid population following keplerian orbits ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 , 2016b ; trujillo & sheppard 2014 ; de la fuente marcos , de la fuente marcos & aarseth 2015 , 2016 ; gomes , soares & brasser 2015 ; batygin & brown 2016 ; brown & batygin 2016 ; malhotra , volk & wang 2016 ) . a number of plausible explanations have been suggested .",
    "these include the possible existence of one ( trujillo & sheppard 2014 ; gomes et al .",

    "2015 ) , stellar encounters ( brasser & schwamb 2015 ; feng & bailer - jones 2015 ) , being a by - product of neptune s migration ( brown & firth 2016 ) or the result of the inclination instability ( madigan & mccourt 2016 ) , and having been induced by milgromian dynamics ( pauo & klaka 2016 ) .    at present , most if not all of the unexpected orbital patterns found for the known etnos seem to be compatible with the trans - plutonian planets paradigm that predicts the presence of one or more planetary bodies well beyond pluto . within this paradigm , the best studied theoretical framework is that of the so - called planet nine hypothesis , originally suggested by batygin & brown ( 2016 ) and further developed in brown & batygin ( 2016 ) .",
    "the goal of this analytically and numerically supported conjecture is not only to explain the observed clustering in physical space of the perihelia and the positions of the orbital poles of seven etnos ( see appendix a for further discussion ) , but also to account for other , previously puzzling , pieces of observational evidence like the existence of low perihelion objects moving in nearly perpendicular orbits .",
    "the planet nine hypothesis is compatible with existing data ( cowan , holder & kaib 2016 ; fienga et al .",
    "2016 ; fortney et al . 2016 ; ginzburg , sari & loeb 2016 ; linder & mordasini 2016 ) but , if planet nine exists , it can not be too massive or bright to have escaped detection during the last two decades of surveys and astrometric studies ( luhman 2014 ; cowan et al .",

    "a super - earth in the sub - neptunian mass range is most likely and such planet may have been scattered out of the region of the jovian planets early in the history of the solar system ( bromley & kenyon 2016 ) or even captured from another planetary system ( li & adams 2016 ; mustill , raymond & davies 2016 ) ; super - earths may also form at 125750 au from the sun ( kenyon & bromley 2015 , 2016 ) .",
    "the analysis of the visibility of planet nine presented in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2016a ) revealed probable locations of this putative planet based on data provided in batygin & brown ( 2016 ) and fienga et al .",
    "( 2016 ) ; the original data have been significantly updated in brown & batygin ( 2016 ) .",
    "in addition , independent calculations ( de la fuente marcos et al . 2016 ) show that the apsidal anti - alignment constraint originally discussed in batygin & brown ( 2016 ) plays a fundamental role on the dynamical impact of a putative planet nine on the orbital evolution of the known etnos . here , we improve the results presented in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2016a ) focusing on the effects of the apsidal anti - alignment constraint .",
