    "these peaks constitute the root cause behind the emergent spiral .    for the su(2 ) symmetric model considered thus far the helical ordering can occur in any plane leading to a continuous ground - state degeneracy parametrized by a unit vector @xmath94 perpendicular to that plane . one possible mechanism that will break the global su(2 ) spin symmetry and select a specific spiral plane is the dzyaloshinski - moriya ( dm ) interaction .",

    "this second ground state , being in a different topological sector , is separated from our chosen ground state by a large energy barrier and will be ignored in our subsequent analysis , which by construction focuses on small fluctuations in the vicinity of a single classical ground state .    to study the long - wavelength magnons we note that it is possible to evaluate the spin susceptibility in the vicinity of @xmath137 analytically .",

    "we have neglected the sc gap @xmath14 and worked at @xmath29 .",
    "inclusion of the former leads to changes in @xmath131 near @xmath137 which are small as long as @xmath160 , which is a necessary condition for the topological phase .",
    "such small changes do not significantly alter our conclusions regarding the spiral stability .",
    "similarly , working at non - zero temperature has a negligible effect on the electron spin susceptibility as long as @xmath161 because the electrons are gapped .",
    "since we found both @xmath162 and @xmath163 to be parametrically smaller than @xmath25 our analysis is self - consistent in this regard .",
    "finally , one may ask if other spin states might compete with the assumed spiral ground state .",
    "we have tried several possibilities , including a spiral with a constant out - of - plane spin component , but all were higher in energy ."

    "<S> they either occur under rather extreme conditions ( e.g. the quantum hall liquids @xcite , which require high sample purity , strong magnetic fields and low temperatures ) or demand fine tuning of system parameters , as in the majority of known topological insulators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many perfectly sensible topological phases , such as the weyl semimetals @xcite and topological superconductors @xcite , remain experimentally undiscovered .    </S>",
    "<S> the paucity of easily accessible , stable topological materials has been in a large part responsible for the relatively slow progress towards the adoption of topological phases in the mainstream technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> a question that naturally arises is the following : is there a fundamental principle behind this `` topological resistance '' ? </S>",
    "<S> although unable to give a general answer to this question we provide in this letter a specific counterexample to this conjectured phenomenon of topological resistance . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a simple model system which , as we demonstrate , _ wants _ to be topological in a precisely defined sense . </S>",
    "<S> the key to this `` topofilia '' is the existence in the system of a dynamical parameter that adjusts itself in response to changing external conditions so that the system self - tunes into the topological phase .    </S>",

    "<S> exactly how the pitch of the spiral depends on the system parameters and its thermodynamic stability are two key issues that have not been previously discussed . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that , remarkably , under generic conditions the pitch of the spiral that minimizes the free energy of the system coincides with the one required to establish the topological phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind the self - organization phenomenon outlined above is easy to understand and is similar to that leading to the spiral ordering of nuclear spins proposed to occur in 1d conducting wires @xcite and 2d electron gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some experimental evidence for such an ordering has been reported @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the natural wavevector for the spiral ordering in such a 1d metal is @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes its fermi momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the static spin susceptibility @xmath4 of a 1d metal has a divergence at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> electron scattering off of such a magnetic spiral results in opening of a gap in the electron excitation spectrum but only for one of the two spin - degenerate bands @xcite . in the end , we are left with a single , non - degenerate fermi crossing at @xmath6 , illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c . according to the kitaev criterion </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this is exactly the condition necessary for a 1d tsc to emerge . in the following we will show that this reasoning remains valid when we include superconductivity from the outset and when we describe the chain by a tight - binding model appropriate for a discrete atomic chain .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by studying the simplest model of tight - binding electrons coupled to magnetic moments @xmath7 described by the hamiltonian @xmath8 here @xmath9 creates an electron with spin @xmath10 on site @xmath11 , @xmath12 stands for the exchange coupling constant and @xmath13 is the vector of pauli spin matrices . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1]c for the case of nearest - neighbour hopping with @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> if viewed as a rigid band structure then according to the kitaev criterion @xcite the chain will support topological superconductivity when there is an odd number of fermi crossings in the right half of the brillouin zone . </S>",

    "<S> taking @xmath7 to be classical magnetic moments and working at @xmath29 we thus proceed to minimize the ground state energy of the electrons @xmath30 for a given value of @xmath1 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this procedure is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a and confirms that at minimum @xmath31 , as suggested by the general arguments advanced above . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , for almost all relevant values of @xmath1 and @xmath14 the self - consistently determined spiral pitch @xmath17 is precisely the one required for the formation of the topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> this fails only close to the half filling ( @xmath32 ) where @xmath33 indicates an antiferromagnetic ordering . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of the band structure prohibits an odd number of fermi crossings so the system must be in the trivial phase . </S>",
    "<S> also , it is clear that no value of @xmath17 can bring about the tsc phase when @xmath1 lies outside of the tight - binding band and the system is an insulator . the resulting topological phase diagram is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b .    </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that , as we argued on general grounds , the pitch of the magnetic spiral self - tunes into the topological phase for nearly all values of the chemical potential @xmath1 for which such a tuning is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of majorana zero modes at the two ends of such a topological wire @xcite and their significance for the quantum information processing have been amply discussed in the recent literature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now address the adatom coupling to the substrate in greater detail . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a more complete hamiltonian @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hspi1 ] ) , while @xmath36\\ ] ] describes the sc substrate with electron operators @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the substrate is characterized by a three - dimensional normal - state dispersion @xmath38 and the bulk gap amplitude @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling is effected through @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the number of adatoms in the chain and @xmath43 denotes their positions .    </S>",
    "<S> we now wish to integrate out the substrate degrees of freedom and ascertain their effect on the magnetic chain . </S>",
    "<S> since the hamiltonian @xmath44 is non - interacting this procedure can be performed exactly . as outlined in the appendix of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , a simple result obtains in the limit of the substrate bandwidth much larger than the chain bandwidth @xmath45 , which we expect to generically be the case . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> the green s function of the chain reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the matsubara frequency , @xmath48 is the substrate normal density of states projected onto the chain ( with @xmath49 the adatom spacing ) and @xmath50+\\sigma^x js\\ ] ] the bare chain green s function . </S>",
    "<S> the above green s functions are @xmath51 matrices in the combined spin and particle - hole ( nambu ) space , the latter represented by a vector of pauli matrices @xmath52 . in the low - frequency limit @xmath53 , relevant to the physics close to the fermi energy , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hspi12 ] ) implies two effects . </S>",
    "<S> first , the bare chain parameters @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath12 are reduced by a factor of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> second , a sc gap @xmath56 is induced in the chain . in the limit of a weak chain - substrate coupling , @xmath57 , </S>",
    "<S> the later is seen to become @xmath58 , independent of the substrate gap @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to visualize the above effects we display in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] the relevant spectral function , defined as @xmath59\\ ] ] where @xmath60 represents a positive infinitesimal . </S>",
    "<S> the figure clearly shows how the bands self - consistently adjust to the changing chemical potential as well as the expected topological phase transitions taking place between the trivial and the tsc phases .    </S>",
    "<S> our results thus far relied on the mean field theory and ignored interactions beyond those giving rise to superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> there are several effects that can in principle destabilize the topological state found above but we now argue that the latter remains stable against both interactions and fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> first , one may worry that the adatom magnetic moments would be screened by the kondo effect at temperatures @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the density of states in the substrate at the fermi level . for a normal metal </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath63 can indeed be sizeable  tens of kelvins  and the ground state is then non - magnetic @xcite . in the presence of superconductivity , however , @xmath64 and a more elaborate treatment of the kondo problem in the presence of a gap shows that @xmath63 is much reduced @xcite , possibly to zero when @xmath12 is sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> thus , generically , we expect the system to avoid the kondo fixed point and remain magnetic at most experimentally relevant temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> electron - electron interactions in the wire are additionally expected to enhance the magnetic gap @xcite compared to its non - interacting value @xmath25 , which will ultimately further improve the stability of the topological phase .    </S>",
    "<S> second , one must consider thermal and quantum fluctuations which will tend to destroy any ordering present in a 1d wire . since the sc order in the wire is phase - locked to the substrate we may ignore its fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> however , fluctuations in the magnetic spiral order must be considered . in a realistic system spin - orbit coupling </S>",
    "<S> will induce a dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction of the form @xmath65 in the effective spin hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the latter breaks the su(2 ) spin symmetry and pins the spiral order so that the spins rotate in the direction perpendicular to @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining low - energy modes of such a spiral are magnons . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant spin - wave analysis and the origin of the dm interaction are outlined in the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> we find a single linearly dispersing gapless magnon @xmath67 which will reduce the classical ordered moment according to @xmath68 for an infinite wire the integral diverges logarithmically at long wavelengths , signaling the expected loss of the magnetic order in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> we are , however , interested in a wire of finite length @xmath69 where the divergence is cut off at @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> a crude estimate of the transition temperature in this case obtains by assuming @xmath71 over the brillouin zone and setting @xmath72 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hspi15 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath73 with @xmath74 the number of adatoms in the chain . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and typical model parameters @xmath77mev , @xmath78mev and @xmath1 appropriate for the topological phase we find @xmath79 of tens of kelvins ( see also the supplement ) . due to the @xmath80 factor </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 is only weakly dependent on the chain length .    </S>",
    "<S> our results provide strong support for the notion of self - organized topological state . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic moments of atoms assembled into a wire geometry on a superconducting surface are indeed found to self - organize into a topological state under a wide range of experimentally relevant conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent majorana fermions can be probed spectroscopically by the same stm employed in building the structures and will show as zero - bias peaks localized near the wire ends . </S>",
    "<S> the system can be tuned out of the topological phase by applying magnetic field @xmath81 which , when strong enough , will destroy the helical order by polarizing the adatom magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> an attractive feature of this setup is the possibility of assembling more complex structures , such as t - junctions and wire networks that will aid future efforts to exchange and braid majorana fermions with the goal of probing their non - abelian statistics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the general self - organization principle described above should apply to other 1d structures , most notably quantum wires with nuclear spins considered in ref .  ; however the energy scales are expected to be much smaller due to the inherent weakness of the nuclear magnetism .    </S>",
