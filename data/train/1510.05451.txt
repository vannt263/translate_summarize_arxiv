    "the schwinger mechanism @xcite is a non - perturbative phenomenon by which electron - positron pairs can be produced by a static electrical field @xcite .",
    "it is the fact that the field is time independent that makes this process genuinely non - perturbative .",
    "indeed , such an electromagnetic field can be viewed as an ensemble of photons of zero frequency , which by energy conservation are unable to produce massive particles .",
    "the non - perturbative nature of this phenomenon is visible in the fact that the corresponding transition amplitudes are non analytic in the coupling : since they are proportional to @xmath0 , the coefficients of their taylor expansion around @xmath1 are all zero , and only calculations to all orders in the coupling can make this effect manifest .",
    "the non - analytic behavior of these transition probabilities can be understood as a tunneling phenomenon ( see for instance @xcite ) by which a particle from the dirac sea is pulled into the positive energy states : as illustrated in the figure [ fig : s - tunnel ] , the external gauge potential tilts the gap between the dirac sea and the positive energy states , allowing a hole from the sea to tunnel through this gap and materialize as an on - shell positive energy particle on the other side .    from this geometrical interpretation ,",
    "it is clear that the length that needs to be crossed is inversely proportional to the electrical field , leading to a tunneling probability that is exponential in @xmath2 .    from this pocket formula",
    ", we also see that the external field must be very intense in order to lead to a significant probability of particle production : at small coupling , this probability is of order one only for fields that are comparable to a critical field @xmath3 inversely proportional to the coupling constant , @xmath4 . even for the lightest charged particle the electron ,",
    "these are extremely intense fields that still surpass by several orders of magnitude the largest fields achievable experimentally .",
    "note that when one studies the interaction of a charged particle with such an external electrical field , the corresponding expansion is in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "however , if @xmath5 is comparable to the squared mass of the particle , then there is no small parameter to control this expansion and one must treat the external field to all orders .",
    "this is a prerequisite of any formalism aiming at describing the schwinger mechanism .",
    "although the original derivation of the schwinger mechanism was made in the context of quantum electrodynamics , it can be generalized to any quantum field theory coupled to some external field . in the context of strong interactions and quantum chromo - dynamics , where the coupling constant @xmath6 is numerically much larger than in qed",
    ", the production of pairs by the schwinger mechanism may be achievable with more moderate chromo - electrical fields , and this phenomenon may play a role in the discussion of particle production in heavy ion collisions @xcite , or in the decay of `` hadronic strings '' @xcite in the process of hadronization . however , the gauge fields that are generated in heavy ion collisions have two important features : ( i ) since gauge fields have a direct coupling to gluons , the leading contributions for gluon production in heavy ion collisions are tree level contributions , that supersede the 1-loop contributions encountered in the schwinger mechanism ; ( ii ) these fields are in general space and time dependent @xcite , and one must therefore use a formalism that can cope with the most general type of external field , without assuming any symmetry in its space - time dependence . naturally , such fields generally imply that it is no longer possible to obtain closed analytic expressions ( such analytical results have been obtained only for very special time dependences , and for spatial dependences that possess a high degree of symmetry ) . as a consequence",
    ", it is usually necessary to resort to numerical studies , and a recurrent concern in this review will be the practicality of various approaches for these numerical simulations .",
    "the schwinger mechanism can also be discussed in the context of a much simpler scalar field theory , coupled either to a scalar or vector external field ( as in scalar qed ) . despite its lack of connection to possible experimental realizations , this is the simplest example one may think of and it offers a very useful playground for testing new theoretical developments .",
    "in this review , we will often use such toy theories to illustrate various novel approaches , because of their didactic or phenomenological interest .",
    "the outline of this review is as follows . in the section [ sec : extsource ] ,",
    "we consider a scalar theory coupled to an external source and discuss particle production at tree level and 1-loop .",
    "the goal of this section is to present general ideas about these processes , whose range of validity is much broader than the simple toy model used to introduce them . the section [ sec : corr ] is devoted to a discussion of the multi-(anti)particle correlations that exist in the schwinger mechanism .",
    "we first derive their general structure and then work it out in the special case of spatially homogeneous fields ( possibly time dependent ) .",
    "the general discussion of the section [ sec : extsource ] leads to a formulation of the schwinger mechanism in terms of a complete basis of _ mode functions_. in the section [ sec : other ] , we relate this representation to other approaches : the method of bogoliubov transformations , the quantum kinetic equations , and the wigner formalism , and we discuss lattice numerical implementations of this approach in the section [ sec : latt ] .",
    "the section [ sec : wl ] is devoted to the worldline formalism , a radically different ( but equivalent ) formulation of the schwinger formalism based on schwinger s proper - time representation of propagators in an external field .",
    "besides new methods for calculating particle production in an external field , this approach provides a great deal of intuition on the spatio - temporal development of the production process . in the section [ sec : dynamically ]",
    ", we discuss the idea of _ dynamically assisted _",
    "schwinger mechanism , where one superimposes two fields that have vastly different timescales and magnitudes in order to reach particle yields that are much larger than what would have been achieved with each field separately .",
    "in this section , we discuss general aspects of quantum field theories coupled to an external source @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to present the general aspects of such theories , focusing on their main differences with field theories where the sole interaction are the self - interaction of the fields . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we consider a scalar field theory with a quartic self - interaction , whose lagrangian is given by , so that the perturbative expansion around the vacuum also corresponds to small field fluctuations .",
    "the mass is also important : when @xmath7 , producing a particle costs some energy , which is crucial to avoid infrared singularities . ]",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 is an unspecified function of space - time . note that this source is a commuting number - valued object , rather than an operator . in the same way that one usually assumes",
    "that self - interactions are adiabatically turned on and off when @xmath10 , we assume that the external source decreases fast enough when time goes to @xmath11 . moreover , in order to preserve the unitarity of the theory , the external source must be real valued . since this section is devoted to a general discussion , we allow the particles to have self - interactions .",
    "this is important for applications to gluon production in heavy ion collisions , and it leads to some complications .",
    "in contrast , the production of electron - positron pairs in qed is simpler to study because the electrons can only interact directly with the photon field .",
    "interactions between electrons and positrons can happen indirectly , with the mediation of a photon , but this effect is an extremely small correction in practice , that would arise beyond the order considered here .",
    "the main feature of such a theory is that it describes an _ open system _ :",
    "even if the system is initialized in the vacuum state that contains no particles , the external source can and in general will produce particles .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the same theory in the vacuum , where the in- vacuum state and the out- vacuum state are related by a unitary transformation @xmath12  : @xmath13 this property ensures that when @xmath14 , the vacuum state evolves with probability one into the vacuum state , i.e. that no particle is created .",
    "an equivalent statement is that the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude is a pure phase : @xmath15 this has some important practical consequences .",
    "the perturbative expansion for transition amplitudes generates diagrams that contain disconnected vacuum sub - diagrams , i.e. diagrams that have no external legs , but the above property tells us that the sum of all the vacuum diagrams is a pure phase that , although it appears as a prefactor in every transition amplitude , does not play any role after squaring the amplitudes in order to obtain transition probabilities .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to ignore from the start all the graphs that contain vacuum sub - diagrams in the @xmath14 case .",
    "let us return to the case @xmath16 and denote @xmath17 the transition probability from the initial vacuum state @xmath18 to an arbitrary final state @xmath19 .",
    "the unitarity of the theory implies that the sum of these probabilities over all the possible final states is equal to unity , @xmath20 where in the first equality we have separated the vacuum and the populated states .",
    "if particles are produced during the time evolution of the system ( this is possible only if @xmath16 ) , then there is at least one non - empty state @xmath21 for which @xmath22 .",
    "since all these probabilities are numbers in the range @xmath23 $ ] , the previous identity implies that @xmath24 , i.e. that the vacuum does not evolve into the vacuum state with probability one anymore .",
    "a trivial consequence is that the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude is no longer a pure phase , since its square is strictly smaller than unity . because of this , it is no longer possible to disregard the vacuum graphs , as illustrated in the figure [ fig : p11 ] .    in general",
    ", this complicates considerably the diagrammatic expansion when @xmath16 , but we will see later that inclusive quantities have a diagrammatic expansion made only of connected diagrams . moreover , in the case of a strong external source ( of order @xmath25 ) , it becomes hopelessly complicated to calculate exclusive quantities ( such as the probability @xmath17 for an individual final state ) while the inclusive ones are much easier to access .      in order to discuss ways of organizing the calculation of observables in field theories coupled to an external source , the first step is to assess the order of magnitude of a graph in terms of its topology .",
    "obviously , for a graph with multiple disconnected components such as the one in the figure [ fig : p11 ] , the order is obtained as the product of the orders of each of its connected sub - diagrams .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider only connected graphs in this discussion . a connected diagram is fully characterized by the number of sources @xmath26 , the number of propagators @xmath27 , the number of vertices @xmath28 , the number of loops @xmath29 and the number of external particles @xmath30 ( i.e. propagators endpoints that are not connected to a vertex or to a source ) .",
    "these quantities are not all independent .",
    "a first constraint comes from the fact that each propagator has two endpoints and each vertex receives four lines ( for the scalar theory described by the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag - scal ] ) ) : @xmath31 a second identity expresses the number of independent loops @xmath29 in terms of the other characteristics of the graph , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ] : @xmath35 thanks to these two formulas , the order of a connected graph can be written as @xmath36 in this expression , we have combined one power of the coupling @xmath6 with each power of the external source @xmath37 , because the combination @xmath38 disappears from this power counting formula in the strong source regime where @xmath39 ( i.e. when particle production by the schwinger mechanism becomes likely ) .",
    "( [ eq : pc ] ) displays a standard dependence on the number of loops and external legs .",
    "but it also indicates that in the strong source regime the dependence of the order on @xmath26 disappears : therefore , infinitely many graphs contribute at each order . in conjunction with our previous observation that vacuum graphs can not be disregarded , this poses a serious bookkeeping challenge for the calculation of quantities such as the transition probability shown on the figure [ fig : p11 ] .",
    "earlier , we have alluded to important differences between inclusive and exclusive observables when it comes to calculating them . before going into these technical differences ,",
    "let us first define them more precisely . loosely speaking , exclusive observables are related to a full measurement of the final state , while inclusive observables involve dropping a lot of information about the final state .",
    "if we assume the initial state to be empty , all the information about the final state is encoded in the transition amplitudes @xmath40 in which the final state is fully specified by giving the list of the momenta of all the final particles ( in theories with more structure than the scalar theory under consideration in this section , one would also need to specify other quantum numbers of the final particles ) .",
    "any observable related to this evolution can be expressed in terms of these amplitudes .",
    "for instance , the differential probability for producing @xmath41 particles can be expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the on - shell energy of a particle of momentum @xmath44 .",
    "this quantity is called exclusive because only a single final state can contribute to it , at the exclusion of all others .",
    "the archetype of inclusive observables are the particle spectra , obtained from the above probability distributions by integrating out the phase - space of all particles but a few .",
    "the simplest of them is the single particle spectrum , defined as @xmath45 this quantity gives the number of particles ( thanks to the factor @xmath46 included under the sum ) produced in a given momentum range , but the information about the distribution of individual final states has been lost . as we shall see , this quantity is much easier to calculate than the exclusive observables .",
    "experimentally , it is also much more accessible since it only requires to make an histogram of the momenta of the final state particles .",
    "the single particle spectrum has obvious generalizations : the 2-particle spectrum , the 3-particle spectrum , etc ... that provide information about the correlations between the final state particles .",
    "the `` vacuum survival probability '' often plays a special role in discussions of the schwinger mechanism .",
    "this quantity is nothing but @xmath47 a standard result in field theory is that the vacuum transition amplitude @xmath48 can be written as the exponential of the sum of the connected vacuum diagrams , 2=to 7 cm @xmath49 ( only a few tree level contributions to @xmath50 have been shown in the illustration . ) after squaring this amplitude , we get @xmath51 . in the presence of an external source that remains constant over a long interval of time and",
    "is sufficiently spatially homogeneous , the imaginary part @xmath52 can usually be written as an integral over space - time , @xmath53 and the integrand in this formula is often interpreted as the `` particle production rate '' .",
    "we will return on this interpretation later , as it not entirely accurate in general and can be a source of confusion .      earlier in this section , we have seen that the imaginary part of the connected vacuum graphs , @xmath54 , plays an important role in the expression of the transition probabilities .",
    "this imaginary part can be obtained from an extension of the standard feynman rules known as cutkosky s cutting rules @xcite . here , we do not re - derive these rules but simply state them as a recipe , that must be applied to every graph :    * divide the nodes ( vertices and sources ) contained in the graph into a set of @xmath55 nodes and a set of @xmath56 nodes , in all the possible ways .",
    "it is customary to materialize diagrammatically these two sets of nodes by drawing a line ( the `` cut '' ) that divides the graph in two subgraphs .",
    "even if the original graph is connected , the sub - graphs on each side of this cut do not have to be connected . *",
    "the @xmath55 vertices give a factor @xmath57 and the @xmath56 vertices give a factor @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath55 sources give a factor @xmath59 and the @xmath56 sources give a factor @xmath60 . * two nodes of types @xmath61 and @xmath62 are connected by a bare propagator @xmath63 . in momentum space , these four propagators read @xmath64 * multiply the outcome of these rules by @xmath65 .",
    "the subgraph that involves only @xmath55 labels is obtained by the usual feynman rules used to calculate transition amplitudes , while the @xmath56 subgraph is given by the complex conjugation of these rules .",
    "the interpretation of these cutting rules is straightforward : the @xmath55 sector corresponds to an amplitude and the @xmath56 sector to a complex conjugated amplitude , while the @xmath66 and @xmath67 propagators provide the phase - space integration for the ( on - shell , hence the delta functions ) final state particles .",
    "in fact , these rules are the perturbative realization of the optical theorem , that stems from unitarity .",
    "if we write the @xmath68 matrix as @xmath69 , then @xmath70 can be rewritten as @xmath71 by taking the expectation value of this identity in the vacuum state and inserting a complete set of states in the right hand side , it leads to @xmath72 the factor @xmath65 in the right hand side of this identity is the origin of the rule * iv * above .",
    "the schwinger - keldysh @xcite formalism is essentially equivalent to cutkosky s cutting rules , but it is usually introduced as a tool for the perturbative calculation of squared matrix elements rather than as a technique for calculating the imaginary part of a scattering amplitude ( however , the optical theorem states that the two are closely related ) .",
    "all the transition amplitudes such as ( [ eq : trans - amp ] ) contain in their diagrammatic expansion the disconnected vacuum graphs , as shown in the example of the figure [ fig : p11 ] .",
    "in other words , one can pull out a factor @xmath73 in all these amplitudes , or a factor @xmath74 in squared amplitudes . from our previous power counting formula ( [ eq : pc ] ) , we expect @xmath54 to start at the order @xmath75 in the strong source regime , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an infinite series in powers of @xmath78 . at tree level ( @xmath79 ) and in the strong source regime , @xmath77 is therefore of order unity ( but depends non - perturbatively on the source ) .",
    "let us now turn to the probabilities of producing particles .",
    "besides the factor @xmath73 , the transition amplitude from the vacuum to a state containing one particle is made of graphs that connect sources to a single final particle . from eq .",

    "its diagrammatic expansion starts with the following terms 2=to 8 cm @xmath84 the probability @xmath85 of producing two particles is a bit more complicated .",
    "it contains a term",
    "@xmath86 corresponding to the independent emission of two particles ( the factor @xmath87 is a symmetry factor due to the fact that the two particles are indistinguishable ) and an additional term @xmath88 in which the two particles are correlated : @xmath89\\ ; .\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath88 can be obtained as the sum of the _ 2-particle cuts _ of connected vacuum diagrams : 1=to 8 cm @xmath90 likewise , the probability @xmath91 of producing 3 particles reads @xmath92\\ ; , \\ ] ] where the last term is the sum of the _ 3-particle cuts _ of connected vacuum diagrams 1=to 5.3 cm @xmath93    the previous examples can be generalized easily into a formula for the probability of producing @xmath41 particles , @xmath94 in this formula , @xmath95 is the number of clusters ( sets of correlated particles ) into which the @xmath41 particles can be divided . note that , except for the powers of @xmath96 that indicate the order of each term in the strong source regime , this formula is completely generic and does not depend on the details of the field theory under consideration : it just expresses the combinatorics of grouping @xmath41 objects into @xmath95 clusters .",
    "let us end this subsection by noting that unitarity requires that @xmath97 ( this identity can be viewed as a consequence of the optical theorem , since @xmath98 is @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the sum of all the cuts through @xmath50 ) .      so far , our discussion has been at a rather qualitative level .",

    "let us qualitatively explain the mechanism at play .",
    "this is illustrated in the figure [ fig : tunneling ] ( to be compared with the figure [ fig : s - tunnel ] ) . in the standard schwinger effect",
    ", a hole excitation must tunnel through the gap that separates the dirac sea from the band of positive energy states , and there is therefore an exponential suppression in the length of this gap . as cartooned in the figure [ fig : tunneling ] , a photon from the short weak field @xmath696 can slightly raise the energy of a hole excitation . but this effect alone is too weak to reach the positive energy band and produce an on - shell electron - positron pair .",
    "however , once it has been brought to this slightly higher energy , the hole excitation also has a shorter length to tunnel through in order to reach the positive energy band by quantum tunneling . since the tunneling probability is exponentially sensitive to this length , even a moderate change in the length can produce an important increase in the yield",
    "this is the essence of the dynamically assisted schwinger mechanism .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we show the momentum spectra of particles produced in the electrical field . while the quantum kinetic approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we present the same results computed by real - time lattice calculations in the mode function method . in the figure  [ fig : das1 ] , the momentum spectrum with the parameters @xmath697 , @xmath698 and @xmath699 , @xmath700 is plotted . the keldysh parameters for each pulse are @xmath701 , and @xmath702 , respectively . therefore , the first pulse is in the non - perturbative regime , while the second is in the perturbative regime . for comparison , the spectrum produced by the strong and slow pulse ( curve labeled @xmath703 ) alone and that by the single weak and fast pulse ( curve labeled @xmath696 ) alone are also shown .",
    "although the single pulse @xmath696 is extremely weak and the spectrum it produces by itself is several orders of magnitude smaller than the spectrum produced by the pulse @xmath703 , superposing this weak and fast fields causes a dramatic enhancement of the production yield , by a factor around @xmath704 .    in the lowest - order perturbative production studied in the previous subsection ,",
    "the particle production is the most intense when the typical energy carried by photons constituting the electrical field is near to the threshold value @xmath661 . in the case of the single sauter - type pulse ,",
    "the particle yield by the lowest - order production takes maximum value when @xmath705 .",

    "in this review , we have covered some of the recent works related to the study of the schwinger mechanism .",
    "our main motivation in this review has been to present methods that have been designed in order to cope with more general backgrounds than those for which exact analytical solutions exist - dim massless qed , where the fermion fields can be elimnated by a bosonization procedure @xcite . ] , allowing ( numerical ) studies of pair production in backgrounds with arbitrary space - time dependences ( for smooth enough dependences , one may instead use a derivative expansion of the effective action @xcite ) .",
    "two main classes of methods have been discussed in this review .",
    "the first one , that follows more conventional techniques of quantum field theory , is based on the possibility of expressing any one - loop amplitude in a background field in terms of _ mode functions_. loosely speaking , such one - loop amplitudes can be generated by small gaussian fluctuations around a given background , and are therefore fully determined by the knowledge of a basis of small field perturbations about this background .",
    "this approach has a number of variants , that differ in the formulation but share common origins and are rigorously equivalent .",
    "the method of bogoliubov transformations is directly connected to the mode functions by the fact that the bogoliubov coefficients are obtained from the decomposition of the mode functions in fourier modes . for spatially homogeneous electrical fields ,",
    "it is possible to express the time evolution directly at the level of the bogoliubov coefficients themselves , via quantum kinetic equations .",
    "these can be formulated either as two local in time equations for a pair of coupled distributions , one of which is the usual occupation number and the other is an anomalous distribution , or as a single equation , non - local in time , for the occupation number .",
    "when the background field is inhomogeneous , quantum kinetic equations can be generalized into an equation for the wigner distribution of the system ( i.e. the wigner transform of the density operator ) .",
    "the second family of methods that we have discussed in this review revolves around the _ worldline formalism _ , a formulation in which one - loop amplitudes in a background field are expressed as a path integration over all the closed paths in euclidean space - time , parameterized by a extra fictitious time .",
    "although it was originally derived from ideas in string theory , this representation has also some connections with schwinger s proper time formulation for propagators . for a constant and homogeneous background ,",
    "this approach leads easily to the well known analytical one - loop answer .",
    "in other cases , such as the sauter background electrical field , one can obtain approximations valid in the weak field regime by finding extrema of a 5-dimensional action , called worldline instantons due to their resemblance with ordinary instanton solutions .",
    "for even more general backgrounds , numerical methods have been developed , in which one samples statistically the ensemble of worldlines .",
    "although completely equivalent to more conventional methods , the worldline formalism emphasizes the space - time development of the production process , and brings some useful intuition over the relevant phenomena ( e.g. the fact that in weak fields large worldlines play a very important role ) .    besides these developments in the technical tools available for theoretical studies of the schwinger mechanism ,",
    "a number of works have focused on finding the type of external fields that may maximize the yield of produced particles , following the simple observation that the superposition of two fields results in a particle spectrum which is not simply the sum of the spectra that these two fields would produce individually ( because the schwinger mechanism is highly non - linear in the field ) .",
    "a simple yet spectacular such effect is the _ dynamically assisted schwinger mechanism _",
    ", obtained by superimposing a slow but intense field with a fast and much weaker field , both of which are much lower than the critical field . intuitively , the short pulse raises the energy of a hole excitation , thereby shortening the tunneling length it has to overcome in order to be produced on - shell and considerably enhancing the yield .",
    "these phenomena could be used in order to greatly facilitate the experimental production of pairs by the schwinger mechanism .",
    "let us finish this section by listing several topics related to the schwinger mechanism that were not discussed in any detail in this review .",
    "firstly , all the discussion of pair production by external fields in electrodynamics can be carried through to strong interactions in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the most direct extension obviously concerns quark production in a chromo - electrical field @xcite , but the schwinger mechanism can also be relevant for gluon production @xcite . in heavy - ion collisions at high energies ,",
    "the system is approximately boost - invariant in the longitudinal beam direction .",
    "the schwinger mechanism in such a boost invariant expanding geometry has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this review , we have only considered the case where the system is initially in the vacuum state .",
    "this can be generalized to situations where the system is initially non - empty , such as a thermal system @xcite , where quantum statistical effects will alter the production rate of particles by the external field . in qcd ,",
    "it has also been argued that the schwinger mechanism may lead to the dynamical generation of a gluon mass , that could explain some features of the landau gauge propagators and verticein the soft sector @xcite .    besides the production of elementary particles by external fields in vacuum",
    ", the schwinger mechanism can also lead to the production of quasi - particle excitations in more exotic materials such as graphene @xcite , where it may be easier to achieve experimentally .",
    "the possibility of using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice as a simulator for the schwinger mechanism was considered in ref .",

    "let us mention a proposal to use stochastic quantization in ref .",
