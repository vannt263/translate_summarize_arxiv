    "evolutionary prescriptions concerning moderately he - enhanced models ( y=0.30 ) indicate that hb structures evolving inside the is are a mix between structures evolving from the blue to the red and also in the opposite direction .",
    "this effect is mainly caused by the fact that an increase in he - content causes an extension of the excursion toward hotter effective temperatures that these structures perform during their off - zahb evolution ( see the bottom panel of fig .  2 ; sweigart & gross 1976 ; sweigart & catelan 1998 ; fig .",

    "the difference with the most he - enriched models ranges from 10% for red hb stars to 30% for ehb stars ( @xmath10te@xmath94.3 ) .",
    "the increase in the lifetime is caused by the fact that they are fainter , since the he - core mass of he - enhanced models is slightly smaller than the canonical ones . in these structures",
    ", the h - shell plays a marginal role , since the envelope mass is quite small .",
    "the hb region in which the h - shell becomes relevant in the energy budget is for effective temperatures cooler than @xmath10te@xmath94 , and indeed in this region he - enhanced structures are brighter than canonical ones .",

    "the difference is smaller and appears counter - intuitive , since the former structures are , at fixed effective temperature , brighter than the latter ones .",
    "the increase in the he - burning lifetime is mainly caused by the fact that the hydrogen - burning shell in the he - enriched structures is more efficient , due to the increase in the mean molecular weight ( see fig .  6 in bono 2010 ) .",

    "<S> we present new sets of nonlinear , time - dependent convective hydrodynamical models of stars assuming two metal ( z=0.0005 , z=0.001 ) and three helium abundances ( y=0.24 , 0.30 , 0.38 ) . for each chemical composition </S>",
    "<S> we constructed a grid of fundamental ( fu ) and first overtone ( fo ) models covering a broad range of stellar masses and luminosities . to constrain the impact of the helium content on properties </S>",
    "<S> , we adopted two observables period distribution , luminosity amplitudes that are independent of distance and reddening . </S>",
    "<S> the current predictions confirm that the helium content has a marginal effect on the pulsation properties . </S>",
    "<S> the key parameter causing the difference between canonical and he - enhanced observables is the luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we compared current predictions with the sample of 189 stars in and we found that the period range of he - enhanced models is systematically longer than observed . </S>",
    "<S> these findings apply to metal - poor and metal - intermediate he - enhanced models . to further constrain the impact of he - enhanced structures on the period distribution we also computed a series of synthetic hb models and we found that the predicted period distribution , based on a gaussian sampling in mass , agrees quite well with observations . </S>",
    "<S> this applies not only to the minimum fundamentalized period of rr lyrae stars ( 0.39 vs 0.34 day ) , but also to the fraction of type ii cepheids ( 2% vs 3% ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also computed a series of synthetic hb models assuming a mixed hb population in which the 80% is made of canonical hb structures , while the 20% is made of he - enhanced ( y=0.30 ) hb structures . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the fraction of type ii cepheids predicted by these models is almost a factor of two larger than observed ( 5% vs 3% ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the fraction of he - enhanced structures in can not be larger than 20% . </S>"
