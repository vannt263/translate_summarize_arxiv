    "the masses of s - wave heavy - light mesons have been a valuable testing ground for lattice nrqcd studies .",
    "the calculations are precise enough to test convergence of the nrqcd expansion@xcite , and the effects of quenching@xcite . also , experimental measurements are precise enough to constrain the values of coefficients in the nrqcd action@xcite .    for p - waves ,",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "experiments have not yet resolved the splittings among p - wave states , and isgur@xcite has recently promoted the suggestion , initiated long ago by schnitzer@xcite , that the p - wave states may be inverted relative to the conventional hydrogen - like ordering .",
    "this inversion is predicted by using the experimental @xmath0 masses and mixing angle as input , then extrapolating from the constituent strange quark to charm or bottom via a @xmath1-expanded nonrelativistic potential .",
    "verification of this prediction would thus lend support to the treatment of a constituent strange quark as `` heavy '' within a nonrelativistic quark model .    to date , quenched lattice qcd calculations have not seen an inversion@xcite , although the uncertainties are often large enough to make firm conclusions difficult .    the present work is an exploration of this physics using an improved action on anisotropic lattices .",
    "the results obtained below agree qualitatively with previous lattice calculations , but a quantitative comparison reveals differences .",
    "the lattice action has three terms : gauge action , light quark action and heavy quark action .",
    "the entire action is classically and tadpole - improved with the tadpole factors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , defined as the mean links in landau gauge in a spatial and temporal direction , respectively .",
    "the gauge action includes a sum over 1@xmath42 rectangular plaquettes as well as 1@xmath41 elementary plaquettes , and therefore the leading classical errors are quartic in lattice spacing . for light quarks ,",
    "a d234 action@xcite is used with parameters set to their tadpole - improved classical values .",
    "its leading errors are cubic in lattice spacing .",
    "the heavy quark action is nrqcd@xcite , which is discretized to give the following green s function propagation@xcite : @xmath5 with @xmath6 chosen for this work , and the hamiltonian is truncated at @xmath7 , @xmath8 a tilde denotes removal of the leading discretization errors , leaving the action with quadratic lattice spacing errors .",
    "notice that the coefficients in @xmath9 are set to their tadpole - improved classical values .",
    "all data presented here come from 2000 gauge field configurations on 10@xmath1030 lattices at @xmath11 with a bare aspect ratio of @xmath12 , which corresponds to @xmath13 fm .",
    "the light quark mass is fixed by @xmath14 , which gives @xmath15 , ie .",
    "fixed time boundaries are used for the light quark propagators so they fit naturally into a meson with an nrqcd heavy quark propagator .",
    "four heavy quark masses have been studied : @xmath17 .",
    "calculation of the kinetic mass of the @xmath18 heavy - light meson leads to the following charm and bottom quark masses : @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "more precise determinations of these parameters are not required for the present exploratory study .",
    "familiar heavy - light meson creation operators are used , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is given in table  [ operators ] and the smearing operator is @xmath23^{n_s}.\\ ] ] all plots shown here use @xmath24 at the source ( which is fixed to timestep 4 ) and a local sink .",
    ".heavy - light meson creation operators . [ cols=\">,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ sp ] shows the @xmath18 and @xmath25 simulation energies in the bottom region . in nrqcd , only energy differences are physical but this plot is an indication of the data quality . as for all plots in this work ,",
    "the uncertainties are determined from 5000 bootstrap ensembles .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath25-@xmath18 splitting is in agreement with previous lattice determinations ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) .    fig .",
    "[ sdiff ] shows the @xmath26-@xmath18 mass splitting and the kinetic shift of the @xmath18 simulation energy in the bottom region . in physical units ,",
    "the @xmath26-@xmath18 splitting is found to be 34@xmath275  mev , in agreement with the known quenched result ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) .    fig .",
    "[ pdiff ] displays the mass splittings among p - wave states at all available quark masses .",
    "the @xmath28 is not shown since it is not distinguishable from the @xmath25 . near the source",
    ", the states are organized according to the familiar hydrogen - like pattern : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 from lightest to heaviest .    as time increases",
    ", the uncertainties grow such that one might be tempted to define a plateau which begins rather close to the source .",
    "however , the central values of the mass splittings tend to decrease for increasing time , so a negative mass splitting ( i.e. an inverted spectrum ) can not be ruled out conclusively .    using @xmath13 fm , fig .",
    "[ pdiff ] indicates that the @xmath32-@xmath33 splitting for bottom mesons is less than 100  mev , which should be contrasted with ref .",
    "@xcite , where lattice nrqcd gave 183@xmath2734  mev . while it is true that the two determinations stem from different methods ( different lattice actions , anisotropic versus isotropic lattices , different light quark masses , slightly different temporal lattice spacings ,  ) , it is disconcerting that the final results are not in better agreement .    in conclusion",
    ", this work has led to an upper bound for the @xmath32-@xmath33 ( bottom ) splitting which lies below a previous lattice determination .",
    "an inverted spectrum , although not suggested by the calculation , can not yet be ruled out .",
