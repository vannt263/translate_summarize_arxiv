    "it is important to assess the robustness of our stacking results and the significance of our stacked signal .",

    "for example , we stacked randomly selected sets of 6845 sources from sample  a. we repeated this procedure 10,000 times and find not a single case where the stacked signal resolves more xrb or has higher significance compared to sample  d. this is consistent with our reported significance of ( @xmath127@xmath130)@xmath82 with @xmath131@xmath132 .",

    "such a significant stellar - mass growth would imply a very large reservoir of gas present to sustain a large amount of star formation since @xmath142 .",

    "suggesting that agns may be common in relatively low - mass star - forming galaxies at @xmath169 .",
    "further near - infrared spectroscopic observations are needed to identify larger samples of highly obscured agns in relatively low - mass galaxies at high redshifts . however , as demonstrated by goulding & alexander ( 2009 ) and goulding et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) , even in the nearby universe significant mass accretion onto smbhs could be missed in the most sensitive optical surveys due to absent or weak optical agn signatures caused by extinction .",
    "locally , a recent study revealed a -detected , moderately obscured ( @xmath226  cm@xmath6 ) agn that may have @xmath227 residing in a dwarf galaxy ( ) with @xmath228 ( reines et  al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , there are likely at least several hundred highly obscured agns hidden in sample  d. if we could better isolate this population of missing agns , we would be able to boost significantly the stacked signal .",
    "one possibility for achieving a better stacked signal would be to obtain improved photometry that extends to the key rest - frame @xmath44-band or beyond .",
    "such improved photometry will lead to more reliable stellar - mass estimates , which will consequently result in a more efficient sample selection and a likely boost in the stacked signal .",
    "the mid - infrared instrument ( miri ; swinyard et  al .",
    "2004 ; wright et  al .",
    "2004 ) onboard the james webb space telescope ( _ jwst _ ; gardner et  al . 2006 ) will be able to provide near- and mid - ir data that are greatly superior to the _ spitzer _ irac data currently in use .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of miri ( for the same length of exposure and the same signal - to - noise ratio ) go deeper by over 2  magnitudes than those of irac .",
    "this means that all of our sample  a sources ( compared to @xmath22960% currently ) will have rest - frame @xmath44-band coverage or beyond with photometric quality significantly better than that at present .",
    "other possibilities for increasing the stacked signal by , for instance , identifying agn candidates through morphologies or through deep optical and near - infrared spectroscopic observations ( where the candels imaging and _ jwst _ spectroscopic data would be most critical ) , remain of interest , but are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "one might think that future hard  missions such as _ nustar _ and would be able to detect such highly obscured agns hidden in relatively low - mass galaxies . in the distant universe ( @xmath230 ) , however , _ nustar _ and simply do not have sufficient sensitivity to make such direct detections ( e.g. , luo et  al .",
    "in contrast , a 10  ms  has the potential of detecting a fraction of such highly obscured agns if at least some of these hidden sources are not too far below the detection threshold of the 4  ms .",
    "furthermore , a 10  ms  would also increase the signal - to - noise ratios of the stacking results and thus complement the aforementioned approaches of improved sample selection .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful feedback that improved this work .",
    "we thank t.  dahlen for providing the @xmath0-band selected photometric catalog , j.  r.  mullaney and m.  pannella for making comparisons between stellar - mass estimates , and r.  ciardullo and c.  gronwall for helpful discussions .",

    "<S> using the 4  ms  deep field - south ( cdf - s ) survey , we have identified a sample of 6845  undetected galaxies that dominates the unresolved of the 68  kev cosmic  background ( xrb ) . </S>",
    "<S> this sample was constructed by applying mass and color cuts to sources from a parent catalog based on goods - south _ hst _ @xmath0-band imaging of the central 6-radius area of the 4  ms cdf - s . </S>",
    "<S> the stacked 68  kev detection is significant at the @xmath1 level , but the stacked emission was not detected in the 46  kev band which indicates the existence of an underlying population of highly obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . </S>",
    "<S> further examinations of these 6845 galaxies indicate that the galaxies on the top of the blue cloud and with redshifts of @xmath2 , magnitudes of , and stellar masses of @xmath3 make the majority contributions to the unresolved xrb . </S>",
    "<S> such a population is seemingly surprising given that the majority of the  detected agns reside in massive ( @xmath4 ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss constraints upon this underlying agn population , supporting evidence for relatively low - mass galaxies hosting highly obscured agns , and prospects for further boosting the stacked signal . </S>"
