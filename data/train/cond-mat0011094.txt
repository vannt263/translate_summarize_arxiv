    "networks of many interacting units play an important role in epidemiology , ecology , gene regulation , neural networks , and many other fields@xcite . in many studies of these networks ,",
    "the number of nodes is considered to be fixed and the presence of a link between two nodes is treated as a random event independent of the other links .",
    "these assumptions lead naturally to random graph models@xcite .",
    "while these models have rich behavior and considerable utility , they are not necessarily appropriate for describing _ growing _ networks , where the addition of nodes and links may depend on the local features of the network where the growth event is taking place .",
    "typical examples of such growing networks include transportation or electrical distribution systems , where growth occurs in response to population - driven demands .",
    "two currently appealing examples are the distribution of scientific citations and the structure of the world - wide web . for both these examples",
    "there is now considerable data available , in spite of the very rapid growth of these systems . in the former case , one may consider papers to be the nodes of a graph and citations as the links .",
    "the structure of the resulting `` citation graph '' was originally studied by lotka in 1926@xcite , and then by many others @xcite .",
    "the basic feature of this citation distribution is that it appears to have a relatively steep power - law tail ; thus most papers are minimally cited while highly - cited papers are rare .",
    "similarly , in the web graph , much structural data has recently been obtained @xcite which suggest that the number of nodes with @xmath0 links has a power - law tail , with an exponent that is somewhat larger than 2 .",
    "this power - law tail again corresponds to the basic fact that most nodes of the web graph are unimportant , while a relatively small number of nodes garner a large fraction of `` hits '' . due to the qualitative similarities between the citation and web graphs , insights developed in the field of bibliometrics@xcite",
    "have been applied to help understand the structure of the web@xcite .    because of the dynamic nature of the citation and web graphs , it is not surprising that their topologies at any fixed time are very different from classical random graphs . in distinction to the power - law degree distributions of the citation and web graphs , random graphs have a poisson node degree distribution . here",
    "node degree is defined as the number of links at a node . to overcome the shortcomings of random graphs in describing the dynamic natures of these systems , both `` small - world '' networks @xcite and growing random network models@xcite have been recently introduced .",
    "the former are aimed at understanding the relatively small diameter of large graphs of socially interacting units , while the latter seek to understand the growth dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a comprehensive quantitative description of a simple _ growing network _ ( gn ) model .",
    "our results are based on the analysis of the rate equations for the densities of nodes of a given degree .",
    "this approach bears many similarities to the rate equations for the kinetics of aggregation .",
    "the rate equations for the evolution of growing networks are relatively simple and the results that emerge are comprehensive .",
    "thus it appears that the rate equation method is better suited for probing the structure of growing random networks compared to the classical approaches for analyzing random graphs , such as probabilistic@xcite or generating function@xcite techniques .",
    "the rate equation approach also has the advantage that it can be adapted to other evolving graph systems , including networks with addition and deletion of nodes and links , as well as networks with link re - wiring .",
    "we will specifically investigate two types of models : ( a ) the gn in which nodes are added one at a time and a link is established with a pre - existing node according to an attachment probability @xmath1 which depends only on the degree of the target node ( fig .  [ network ] ) , and ( b ) the gn with re - direction ( gnr ) , in which the newly - created link can be re - directed to the `` ancestor '' node of the original target node . an important feature of these models is that the links are _ directed _ and the resulting graphs have a simple tree - like topology .",
    "the motivation for the gnr model is that this re - direction process roughly mimics how we might ( lazily ) construct the references to this paper .",
    "in addition to papers that we peruse and cite directly , we are also likely to incorporate some of the references within these papers as part of our reference list .",
    "a related `` copying '' process also affects the organization of the web@xcite .",
    "0.6 in = 2.3 in 0.1 in    one of our primary results is that for asymptotically linear attachment kernels , @xmath9 as @xmath10 , the degree distribution of the gn has a power - law form @xmath3 , with @xmath4 tunable in the range @xmath5 . by choosing the control parameters of our model in a plausible manner",
    "it is then easy to reproduce the quantitative observations about the node degree distribution of the web graph .    in sec .",
    "ii , we define the gn and gnr models precisely and then determine their node degree distributions in sec .",
    "iii by the rate equation approach .",
    "different distributions arise in the gn model which depend on the asymptotic behavior of the attachment probability as a function of node degree . in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate the joint age - degree distribution and find ( not surprisingly ) that `` old '' nodes are typically more highly connected . in sec .",
    "v , we study the correlations which develop between the degrees of connected nodes as the network grows . in sec .",
    "vi , we study a more global measure of the network , namely , the size distributions of the `` in - component '' and `` out - component '' . with respect to a given node",
    "* x * , the in - component is the set of nodes which can reach node * x * via a directed path of links .",
    "conversely , the out - component is the set nodes which can be reached from node * x * via a directed path .",
    "the former exhibits a robust power - law size distribution which appears to be independent of the attachment probability .",
    "the latter distribution predicts a network `` diameter '' which grows as @xmath8 and also provides basic insights about the genealogy of the network .",
    "we conclude in section vii .",
    "in the gn , we introduce a new node at each time step and link it to one of the earlier nodes in the network ( fig .",
    "[ network ] ) .",
    "this leads to a network which has a topology of a ( directed ) tree graph . in terms of citations",
    ", we may interpret the nodes as publications , and the directed link from one paper to another as a citation to the earlier publication . in terms of the web graph",
    ", nodes are web pages and the directed links are hyperlinks .",
    "we will refer to the node to which the link is directed as the _ ancestor _ of the current node .",
    "as the network grows , a degree distribution @xmath2 , defined as the average number of nodes with @xmath0 links ( @xmath11 incoming and 1 outgoing ) builds up .",
    "the initial node is unique as it does not have an outgoing link .",
    "the basic ingredient which determines the structure of the network is the _ attachment kernel _ @xmath1 , defined as the probability that the newly - introduced node links to an existing node which already has @xmath0 links . on general grounds , this attachment kernel should be a non - decreasing function of @xmath0 , and natural scenarios are attachment kernels with a power law dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "for the linear kernel , the gn reduces to the `` scale free '' model introduced by barabsi and albert@xcite and further investigated in @xcite .",
    "the general homogeneous model , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , was investigated in@xcite where it was found that the degree distribution @xmath2 crucially depends on the value of @xmath14 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the linking probability grows weakly with node `` popularity '' and @xmath2 decreases as a stretched exponential in @xmath0 for any @xmath16 .",
    "the complementary case of @xmath17 leads to phenomenon akin to gelation@xcite in which a single `` gel '' node links to nearly every other node . for @xmath18 ,",
    "this phenomenon is so extreme that the number of links between other nodes is finite in an infinite graph .",
    "we shall show that these results also apply for the more general situation where @xmath19 as @xmath10 in addition to the strictly homogeneous situation where @xmath12 .",
    "the borderline case of an asymptotically linear attachment kernel , @xmath20 , is particularly intriguing as it leads to @xmath21 , with the exponent @xmath4 tunable to _ any _ value larger than 2 depending on finer details of the attachment kernel . in particular",
    ", the strictly linear kernel , @xmath22 , leads to @xmath23 .",
    "however , by changing the value of a single attachment probability , for example @xmath24 and @xmath22 for @xmath25 , any value of @xmath26 is possible .",
    "this sensitivity of asymptotic behavior on microscopic details indicates that the case of attachment index @xmath27 is marginal .",
    "a related phenomenon occurs in constant - kernel aggregation , where the asymptotic kinetics is sensitively dependent on the actual values of the reaction rate@xcite .",
    "the gn is built by simultaneous node and link addition and disregards other elemental processes which can occur in the development of large networks . in the context of the web ,",
    "these include node and link deletion ( for out - of - date websites ) , link re - wiring , the tendency of a new node to connect to nearby nodes , and the copying of links from existing nodes to new nodes .",
    "the gnr model incorporates a simple form of link re - wiring into the gn model . at each time step ,",
    "a new node * n * is added and an earlier node * x * is selected _ uniformly _ as a possible `` target '' for attachment . with probability @xmath28 , the link from * n * to * x * is created ; in this case , the evolution is the same as in the gn . however , with probability @xmath29 , the link is _ re - directed _ to the ancestor node * y * of node * x * ( fig .",
    "[ r ] ) .    0.6 in = 1.8 in 0.1 in    a model of this spirit was recently mentioned in the context of the web development@xcite .",
    "a related model was also proposed long ago by simon@xcite to describe the word frequencies of english text .",
    "the simon model gives a power - law frequency distribution whose exponent is tunable in manner which closely mirrors the behavior in the gnr model .",
    "the simon model was also recently applied to explain power - law distributions in the frequency of family names@xcite .",
    "while at first sight the gnr model appears complicated , we shall see that its characteristics can be obtained in a simple fashion .",
    "another very helpful and surprising property of the gnr with a uniform initial attachment probability is that it is equivalent to the gn with a shifted linear attachment kernel and _ no _ re - direction",
    ". we shall exploit this equivalence extensively in the following .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the gnr separately , as in many cases the rate equations for the gnr with a _ uniform _ attachment kernel is simpler to appreciate than the rate equations for the gn with a shifted linear attachment kernel .",

    "( [ nk ] ) accounts for the process in which a node with @xmath11 links is connected to the new node , leading to a gain in the number of nodes with @xmath0 links .",
    "this happens with probability @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the appropriate normalization factor .",
    "a corresponding role is played by the second ( loss ) term on the right - hand side of eq .  ( [ nk ] ) .",
    "notice that the overall amplitude in @xmath1 is irrelevant , since it appears in both the numerator and denominator of eq .",

    "many other reactions , such as the becker - dring theory of nucleation@xcite , additive polymerization@xcite , hydrolysis@xcite , catalysis and submonolayer epitaxial growth@xcite , fit into this scheme .",
    "however , there is one important difference in that we consider strictly a single connected cluster ( the growing network ) , while in the context of aggregation - like processes , one generally deals with a collection of clusters .",
    "the effect of having more than one cluster in the framework of growing networks is currently under investigation@xcite .",

    "this shifted linear kernel can be motivated naturally by explicitly keeping track of the directionality of the links .",
    "in particular , the node degree for an undirected graph generalizes to the in - degree and out - degree for a directed graph .",

    "hence the general linear attachment kernel reduces to @xmath104 .",
    "since , as mentioned above , the overall scale factor in the kernel is irrelevant , we can re - write @xmath1 as the shifted linear kernel @xmath98 , with @xmath105 , so that it can vary over the range @xmath106 .    we can now easily determine the degree distribution for the shifted linear attachment kernel .",
    "first we note that @xmath107 .",

    "furthermore , from eq .",
    "( [ nkgen ] ) we easily determine the entire degree distribution to be @xmath112 in a similar vein , we can solve the gn with an arbitrary piecewise linear attachment kernel .",
    "in all these cases , the exponent @xmath4 can be tuned to any value larger than 2 , and for sufficiently large degree @xmath50 can be expressed as the ratio of gamma functions , _",
    "i.  e. _ , the degree distribution is a purely ( discrete ) algebraic function .      for the super - linear homogeneous attachment kernels , @xmath12 with @xmath17",
    ", we now show that a `` winner take all '' phenomenon arises , namely , there emerges a single dominant `` gel '' node which is linked to almost every other node .",
    "a particularly singular behavior occurs for @xmath18 , where there is a non - zero probability that the initial node is connected to _ every _ other node of the network .",
    "let us first determine the probability that the initial node connects to all other nodes .",
    "it is convenient to consider a discrete time version of the gn in which one node is introduced at each elemental step which always links to the initial node .",
    "after @xmath113 steps , the probability that the new node will link to the initial node is @xmath114 .",
    "this probability that this connectivity pattern continues indefinitely is @xmath115 clearly , @xmath116 when @xmath117 but @xmath118 when @xmath18 .",
    "thus for @xmath18 there is a non - zero probability that the initial node connects to all other nodes .    to determine the behavior for general @xmath17 , we first need the asymptotic time dependence of @xmath119 . to this end , it is useful to consider the discretized version of the master equations eq .",

    "then @xmath120 whenever @xmath121 and the rate equation for @xmath122 immediately leads to @xmath123 from this , and the obvious fact that @xmath122 must be less than unity , it follows that @xmath124 can not grow more slowly than @xmath125 . on the other hand",

    "thus by neglecting this term we obtain @xmath130 .",
    "similarly , @xmath131 gives @xmath132 .",
    "continuing this same line of reasoning for each successive rate equation gives the leading behavior of @xmath47 , @xmath133 with @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "this pattern of behavior for @xmath47 continues as long as its exponent @xmath135 remains positive , or @xmath136 .",
    "the full temporal behavior of the @xmath2 may be determined straightforwardly by keeping the next correction terms in the rate equations .",
    "for example , @xmath137 .    for @xmath138 , each @xmath47 has a finite limiting value in the long - time limit .",
    "since the total number of connections equals @xmath139 , and @xmath16 of them are associated with @xmath140 , the remaining @xmath16 links must all connect to a single node which has @xmath16 connections ( up to corrections which grow no faster than sub - linearly with time ) .",
    "consequently the amplitude of @xmath119 equals unity , as argued above .",
    "therefore for super - linear kernels , the gn undergoes an infinite sequence of connectivity transitions as a function of @xmath14 . for @xmath18",

    "the data that we discuss is based on : ( a ) 783,339 papers with 6,716,198 citations ( provided by the institute of scientific information ( isi ) ) , and ( b ) 24,296 papers with 351,872 citations from all issues of physical review d ( prd ) from 19751994 ( provided by the spires database)@xcite .",

    "this ambiguity between a stretched exponential and power - law form for the citation distribution corresponds to the situation where the predictions of the gn itself are difficult to discern numerically .    if we consider the gn with attachment kernel @xmath19 for @xmath150 , then a plot of @xmath50 in eq .",

    "these correlations are a crucial feature which distinguishes the gn from classical random graphs . thus testing for the presence of correlations between node degrees in large evolving networks may provide crucial insights to help determine the underlying mechanism of their growth .",
    "we have also studied two specific large - scale properties of the network , namely , the size distributions of the in- and out - components with respect to a given site .",
    "the in - component distribution exhibits a robust @xmath6 power - law behavior , where @xmath7 is the component size , as long as the attachment probability does not grow faster than linearly with node degree .",
    "the out - component distribution reveals the basic genealogical feature that the number of `` generations '' in the network grows logarithmically with the total number of nodes , again for attachment kernels which do not grow faster than linearly in node degree .",
    "the qualitative agreement between the degree distributions of real evolving networks , such as the web graph , and the gn is reassuring given that the model ignores many important features of real networks .",
    "nevertheless , a number of characteristics of real growing networks are difficult to treat in the framework of the gn model .",
    "one important such characteristic is the out - degree distribution . within the gn model",
    "the out - degree of each node is one by construction .",
    "in contrast , for real growing networks the out - degree distribution has a power law form@xcite .",
    "additionally , the average in- and out - degrees at each node are generally larger than one . for the web graph , for example , @xmath362@xcite .",
    "there are several natural ways to extend the gn model to generate an average out - degree which is greater than one .",
    "a simple construction is to link every new node to more than one earlier node , as already discussed in ref .",
    "let us consider a network which is built by attaching every new node to exactly @xmath363 earlier nodes . for the linear attachment kernel",
    ", the degree distribution @xmath2 , which is now defined only for @xmath364 , evolves according to @xmath365+\\delta_{kp}.\\ ] ] clearly , the average in - degree @xmath366 and out - degree @xmath367 of each node in this network is equal to @xmath363 . by applying the basic approach of sec .",
    "iii to this rate equation , we find that the degree distribution again asymptotically approaches a stable distribution @xmath368 , with @xmath369 thus for the linear attachment kernel , the average node degree does not affect the exponent @xmath4 of the degree distribution .",
    "however , for other solvable examples , the new feature of attaching the new node to more than one pre - existing node leads to different degree distributions .",
    "for example , for the shifted linear kernel we find @xmath370 this gives the asymptotic behavior @xmath371 .",
    "thus the exponent of the degree distribution _ depends _ on the average node degree , with @xmath372 .",
    "the multiple linking construction also reduces the number of nodes with in - degree zero .",
    "for example , for the gn with the shifted linear attachment kernel , the fraction of such nodes is @xmath373 , which is always larger than 1/2 .",
    "however , for the multiple linking construction , the fraction of nodes with in - degree zero is reduced to the value @xmath374 given in eq .",
    "( [ np ] ) . if we use @xmath375 to reproduce the correct average node degree of the web graph , the fraction of nodes with in - degree zero always exceeds 1/8 , which , however , apparently disagrees with web data @xcite .",
    "thus while multiple attachment does reduce the number of poorly - connected nodes , this reduction is still insufficient to account for web - graph data .",
    "however , it is clear that the multiple linking construction has the potential to provide a better description of citation data .",
    "another shortcoming of the multiple attachment construction is that it can not dynamically generate a non - trivial out - degree distribution .",
    "however , we can extend the gn model by allowing for creation of links between existing nodes@xcite .",
    "this simple construction allows us to generate non - trivial out - degree distributions which closely match web graph data .",
    "an even more challenging direction is to describe the global topological structure of growing networks .",
    "the gn model leads to a single - component tree graph , while the web graph has numerous disconnected components .",
    "a deeper understanding of the web graph may provide valuable insights to help develop algorithms for web crawling , searching , and community discovery .",
