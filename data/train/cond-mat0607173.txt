    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first we give a characterization in terms of the dominant correlation function for the extended gapless critical phase , whose mere existence is well established .",
    "we find in this case that the predominant correlations are of spin quadrupolar nature , with a wavevector of @xmath15 .",
    "the second aim is to shed some more light on the region @xmath16 $ ] of the single chain .",
    "we present extensive numerical simulation results based on different numerical methods and discuss possible interpretations . due to the difficulty in obtaining a firm conclusion regarding the spin nematic phase , we have also studied bilinear - biquadratic ladders . in this case",
    "the dimerized phase plays only a minor role in the phase diagram and we report an extended gapped spin nematic phase , very close in spirit to the proposal by chubukov @xcite for the single chain .",
    "surprisingly this phase seems to be adiabatically connected to the well known haldane phase of the isolated chain .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in section  [ sec : period3 ] we show that the established gapless phase @xmath17 has dominating spin quadrupolar correlations , a characterization which was lacking before .",
    "we then move on to the region @xmath16 $ ] and discuss the possible existence of a spin nematic intermediate phase between the dimerized and the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we report several anomalous physical properties encountered upon approaching @xmath18 , which could be interpreted as a phase transition to a spin nematic state .",

    "this short - ranged ordered phase encompasses the haldane phase at @xmath20 as well as its ladder extension , the so called `` plaquette singlet solid '' state@xcite , and crosses over to a gapped spin nematic state close to @xmath18 .",

    "the special point @xmath23 has an enlarged @xmath19 symmetry and is solvable by bethe ansatz @xcite ( uimin - lai - sutherland model ) , proving the existence of soft modes at @xmath22 as a rigourous result .    despite the consensus on the presence of an extended gapless phase ,",
    "the nature of the dominant correlations in this phase has not been clearly worked out .",
    "initally xiang @xcite proposed an almost `` trimerized '' groundstate , with dominant singlet correlations involving three consecutive spins . although models can be constructed which have exactly trimerized groudstates @xcite , in the present model these are not the dominant fluctuations , as shown earlier in ref .",
    "[ ] .    here",
    "we show that the dominant correlations are not of singlet , but of _ spin nematic _ ,",
    "i.e. quadrupolar character .",
    "we build upon the field theoretical work of itoi and kato @xcite in which they showed that throughout the critical region there are three fields with spin @xmath24 whose scaling dimensions are all equal to @xmath25 .",
    "however apart from @xmath26 it is the @xmath27 mode at @xmath12  which is subject to correlation-_enhancing _ logarithmic corrections  which will show the dominant correlations .",

    "we calculate a component of the static spin _",
    "quadrupolar _ structure factor ( k)= ( s^z)^2(-k ) ( s^z)^2(k ) and similar for the static spin structure factor ( k)= s^z(-k ) s^z(k ) both at the wavevector @xmath30 .",
    "the results shown in the upper plot of fig .  [ fig : trimerizedcorrs ] for system sizes up to @xmath31 display nicely that the quadrupolar correlations indeed become more important than the spin - spin correlations when one moves beyond the @xmath19 symmetric point at @xmath26 .",
    "although all correlation exponents ( dimer , spin , quadrupolar ) are equal to @xmath32 , logarithmic corrections  @xcite render the quadrupolar correlations clearly dominant in this phase .",
    "note that our notion of a dominant correlation function in this case is analogous to the @xmath33 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain , where both staggered spin and staggered dimer correlations have equal correlation exponent @xmath34 , but the logarithmic corrections enhance the spin - spin correlations and then decay more slowly .",
    "hence , in the same spirit as one argues that the dominant correlations of the heisenberg chain are the spin - spin correlations , the dominant correlations of the bilinear - biquadratic spin - one chain for @xmath17 are of spin quadrupolar nature with wavevector @xmath35 .    for completeness",
    "we show selected parameters of this critical region in the lower panel of fig .",

    "we note that the occurrence of dominant period - three quadrupolar correlations on a single chain calls for a fully ordered three sublattice structure when the chains are coupled in an appropriate two - dimensional fashion .",
    "the triangular lattice perfectly fulfills this prerequisite , and indeed recent works @xcite reported analytical and numerical evidence for a three sublattice quadrupolar ordered phase in the region @xmath0 .",
    "after having elucidated the nature of the dominant correlations in the extended critical region beyond the haldane phase , we now turn to the behavior of the bilinear - biquadratic chain between the point where the dimerized groundstate is firmly established ( @xmath41 ) @xcite and the point where the ferromagnetic state takes over ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "let us note that this point @xmath14 is special due to a @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "this symmetry has the consequence that the conventional ferromagnetic multiplet is degenerate with a fully ordered ferroquadrupolar spin nematic state @xcite .",
    "chubukov  @xcite suggested the existence of an intermediate phase which was supposed to be completely gapped and to have dominant short - ranged nematic correlations . since then several studies @xcite  most of them numerical  tried to pin down the existence of an intermediate phase .",
    "presently it seems most likely that the gapped nematic phase in its original form is not realized in the single chain model , mainly because the gap data do not show evidence for a closing and reopening .",
    "nevertheless the spin nematic correlations grow dramatically as one approaches @xmath42",
    ". it could therefore in principle be possible that the dimerized phase gives way to a critical spin nematic phase without a gap  @xcite .",
    "we will critically discuss this possibility in the following .",
    "we track the evolution of the energy gap to the first magnetic excitation using density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations@xcite on long open chains of up to 512 spins and retaining up to 1000 states .",

    "our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrggaptheta ] are clearly consistent with a finite gap of the @xmath27 excitation for @xmath44 .",

    "] an example for such finite size data is shown for @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladderdimerization ] .",
    "we expect the dimerization in the middle of the chain to converge to a finite value for @xmath129 in a dimerized phase , and to exhibit an exponential drop upon reaching the correlation length of a disordered phase .",
    "these two distinct behaviors can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladderdimerization ] for the values @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively .",

    "similar to the single chain case it is very difficult to decide whether the dimerized phase ceases to exist before @xmath13 or not . in the ladder case",
    "however this implies that for a finite  but very small  interchain coupling the spontaneous dimerization ( if any ) of a single chain vanishes .     as a function of @xmath136 $ ] .",

    "there we observe a level crossing , and the gap decreases for @xmath140 .",
    "note that at this special point the total spin quantum number of the lowest level changes . while it is a @xmath2 state for @xmath138 , the lowest levels carries @xmath27 for @xmath140 .",
    "similar to the single chain case discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : chainspintwogap ] , we detect a very small gap for @xmath28 close to @xmath13 .",
    "this anomalously small @xmath27 gap can again be understood using a single mode approximation argument , along the lines of sec .",
    "[ sec : sma ] , the extension of the argument to the ladder case being straightforward .",
    "we take this dichotomy of the gap as a first indication that the @xmath19 line ( @xmath41 ) constitutes a crossover line inside the extended gapped phase , where the spin - spin correlations dominate for @xmath145 , while we expect dominant short - ranged spin nematic ferroquadrupolar correlations for @xmath146 .",
    "our gap results give evidence that the groundstate for @xmath28 close to @xmath13 adiabatically connects to the `` plaquette singlet solid '' phase , which is itself connected to the haldane phase of the isolated chains .",
    "this would also imply that the the whole phase is characterized by a finite nonlocal order parameter .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate this order in a future work .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that spin nematic correlations in the form of quadrupolar correlations play an important role in the phase diagram of single or coupled @xmath2 bilinear - biquadratic chains .",
    "we first addressed the long - standing question of the nature of the dominant correlations in the gapless period - three phase , where we uncovered the spin quadrupolar correlations at @xmath147 as the leading ones .",
    "we critically discussed the phase diagram close to the @xmath19 point at @xmath14 and by assembling several numerical and analytical results concluded that an unconventional crossover phenomenon is at the heart of the considerable difficulty in settling the issue on the existence or absence of the gapped nematic phase put forward by chubukov  @xcite .",
    "finally we studied two coupled bilinear - biquadratic chains in a ladder geometry and found an extended gapped phase which is surprising in two respects : first it realizes a variant of chubukov s nematic phase , i.e. a gapped , non - dimerized phase with dominant spin - nematic correlations for @xmath146 , and second , this phase is adiabatically connected to the standard @xmath2 heisenberg ( @xmath20 ) ladder , and therefore also connected to the haldane phase of single chains , as shown by todo _",
