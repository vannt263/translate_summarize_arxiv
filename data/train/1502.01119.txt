    "in this paper we develop a discontinuous finite element method for cohesive zone modeling using the approach first suggested by hansbo and hansbo @xcite . unlike in the standard pre  failure treatment of cohesive zones , which consists of tying the meshes together using a penalty approach , we use a combination of nitsche s method and the cohesive law governing the interelement stiffness , thus allwoing the same discretization method in both pre  failure and post  failure regimes .",
    "this means that the method is consistent with the original differential equation and no large penalty parameters are required for accurate solutions even in the pre  failure regime .",
    "the approach was implemented for cohesive cracks by heintz and hansbo @xcite in an xfem setting , but here we consider a discontinuous galerkin method allowing for discontinuities appearing only between elements .",
    "an approach similar to ours has been suggested by mergheim , kuhl , and steinmann @xcite , an later used by pretchel et al . @xcite and wu et al . @xcite .",
    "the method of @xcite however uses a different blending of nitsche s method and cohesive zones .",
    "there a discontinuous galerkin method is used only in the pre  failure regime and a switch to a standard cohesive zone approximation is performed at a given traction threshold . to ensure a continuous transition between the discretization methods , a matching of discrete tractions between the two cases",
    "is performed .",
    "this matching is cumbersome in a more general situation of nonmatching meshes across the cohesive zone . in this paper",
    "we avoid this switch and a more generally applicable method results .",
    "an outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we define our discrete method in a linear setting ; in section 3 we discuss and motivate the cohesive law that we favour and the resulting secant compliance we use in our numerical solution process ; and in section 4 we give some numerical examples of our approach . finally ,",
    "in section 5 , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "w consider first an elasticity problem in @xmath0 or @xmath1 dimensions with a smooth boundary @xmath2 dividing @xmath3 into two parts @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the displacement@xmath6_{i=1}^{n_{\\text{sd}}}$ ] has restrictions to the different domains @xmath7 , and we denote by @xmath8 and let @xmath9 denote the outward normal vector to @xmath10 and to @xmath4 on @xmath2 .",
    "then , a linear elasticity problem with cohesive layer @xmath2 can be written : find @xmath11 and and the symmetric stress tensor @xmath12_{i , j=1}^{n_{\\text{sd}}}$ ] such that @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are positive constants called the lam constants , satisfying @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18_{i , j=1}^{n_{\\text{sd}}}$ ] is the strain tensor with components @xmath19 furthermore , @xmath20_{i=1}^{n_{\\text{sd}}}$ ] , @xmath21_{i , j=1}^{n_{\\text{sd}}}$ ] with @xmath22 if @xmath23 and @xmath24 if @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given loads , @xmath28 is a given boundary displacement , and @xmath9 is the outward unit normal to @xmath10 . finally , @xmath29 is a symmetric positive semi  definite flexibility matrix ( constitutive law on @xmath30 ) .",
    "for example , with isotropic elasticity on @xmath30 we have that @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes outer product , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 denoting the complicancy in the direction tangential and normal to @xmath30 , respectively , cf .",
    "( in this paper , a more general compliance , with cross coupling between normal and tangential directions will be considered . )",
    "consider a subdivision of @xmath3 into a geometrically conforming finite element partitioning @xmath35 of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath36 @xmath37^{n_{\\text{sd}}}:~{{\\boldsymbol v}}\\vert_t\\in [ p^k(t)]^{n_{\\text{sd}}}~~ \\forall t \\in { \\mathcal{t}^h}\\}.\\ ] ] we also introduce the set of element faces in the mesh , @xmath38 , and we split @xmath39 into three disjoint subsets @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the set of faces in the interior of @xmath3 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the sets of faces on the dirichlet and neumann part of the boundary , respectively .",
    "further , with each face we associate a fixed unit normal @xmath9 such that for faces on the boundary @xmath9 is the exterior unit normal .",
    "we denote the jump of a function @xmath44 at an internal face @xmath45 by @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for @xmath48 , and the average @xmath49 for @xmath45 , and @xmath50 for @xmath48 , where @xmath51 with @xmath52 .    for the modelling of cohesive interfaces ,",
    "we here assume that the solution may be discontinuous across each element face @xmath30 , and thus the role of @xmath2 in ( [ diffelasti ] ) is now taken by _",
    "all _ element faces .",
    "the dg method can then be formulated as follows : seek @xmath53 such that @xmath54 the bilinear form is defined by @xmath55 and the linear functional by @xmath56 here @xmath57 is a matrix which depends on the interface conditions of the problem , the local meshsize , and a penalty parameter @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a dimensionless number which has to be large enough for the method to be stable .",
    "the stability of the method increases with increasing flexibility , so the choice of @xmath59 needed for stability in the case of zero flexibility can be used in all other cases ( numerical values for @xmath59 can be found , e.g. , in @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , on a face @xmath30 with diameter @xmath60 , @xmath61 on each face @xmath30 , the mesh parameter @xmath60 is defined by @xmath62 we note that as the flexibility goes to zero , we approach a standard discontinuous galerkin method for elasticity . looking instead at the limit case of @xmath63 ( assuming @xmath29 is invertible ) we retrieve a standard formulation for cohesive laws where the only term contributing to the stiffness matrix from the interfaces is the interface stiffness term @xmath64 the proposed method",
    "thus seamlessly blends discontinuous galerkin with standard fem for cohesive interfaces .    by use of green s formula , we readily establish that the method is consistent in the sense that @xmath65 for all @xmath66 and for @xmath67 sufficiently regular , which is key to retrieving optimal accuracy of the method .",
    "stability follows from the analysis in @xcite .",
    "we also mention the work of juntunen and stenberg @xcite , where an analysis of this approach for handling general boundary conditions for poisson s equation is given .",
    "we are now interested in the case when the interface compliance depends on the jump of the solution , @xmath68 . in the numerical solution of the cohesive zone fe model",
    ", we replace this compliance by a corresponding secant compliance as follows .",
    "the compliance between the elements can be defined a priori by cohesive zone models .",
    "frequently , cohesive zone models that are easy to implement are chosen to model the initiation of cracks .",
    "these models are often un - coupled , meaning that there is no relationship between the normal and tangential stresses other than the fracture criterion .",
    "however , it is reasonable to imagine that the tangetial stiffness is effected by the reduction of the normal stiffness .",
    "thus , in order to couple the cohesive behavior of the interfaces in mixed mode , we choose to derive the traction - separation laws from a weighted energy release rate surface , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we denote the energy release rates in pure normal and pure tangetial directions @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , where , for convenience , the normal and tangetial jumps in displacement are denoted by @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the tangent vector to the given face , such that @xmath9 and @xmath73 constitute a right - handed on system .",
    "the energy release rates are obtained from the interface traction on @xmath41 according to    @xmath74    @xmath75    by use of a polar coordinate system , a dimensionless effective separation @xmath14 can be defined together with an angle @xmath76 that determines the mode mix . the mode mix and the effective separation",
    "are defined as    @xmath77    @xmath78    here , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the critical normal and tangential separations in pure modes",
    ". the normal and tangential separations , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are defined as the projections of the effective separation on each respective pure mode axis , cf .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "it then follows that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are given by    @xmath85    @xmath86    in order to obtain the complete contributions of the energy release rates in each pure mode and not the projections , some additional definitions , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are introduced .",
    "for example , we may choose to define @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "as a first step in the development of the cohesive law , two independent functions are fitted to experimentally measured energy release rate curves , see @xmath91 and @xmath92 in fig.[fig : fig4 ] .",
    "the shapes of the traction - separation curves in each pure mode , respectively , are obtained by differentiating the energy release rates in each pure mode with respect to each pure mode relative separation , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . from these curves ,",
    "laws are chosen that captures the most essential features of the curves .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows two idealized schematic curves .    in order to capture the behavior of the cohesive law in mixed mode , the two energy release rate curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] are combined to yield a surface where the axes are total energy release rate , @xmath93 , relative normal and relative tangential separations , @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .        the surface representing the weighted energy release rate , @xmath94 is generated by a weighted sum of the experimentally determined energy release rates in pure normal , @xmath91 , and pure tangential , @xmath92 , directions according to    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the weight function .",
    "the stresses for any given mode mix are given by partial differentiation of @xmath93 with respect to each relative separation , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "@xmath97    @xmath98        the secant compliance is computed as follows .",
    "we first establish the secant stiffness matrix @xmath99 as @xmath100 followed by computing the secant compliance as @xmath101 .",
    "the interface stiffness , @xmath102 , is then given by    @xmath103",
    "a specimen with two inclusions and an initial crack , see fig .",
    "[ fig : simspec ] , is used as a simple example to show the applicability of the modeling technique .",
    "the dimensions of the specimen are given by ; @xmath104 mm , @xmath105 mm , @xmath106 mm .",
    "the lower right inclusion is located at center coordinate @xmath107 mm and the top left inclusion is located at @xmath108 mm .",
    "the crack is located at center coordinates @xmath109 mm and it is inclined at an angle of 33@xmath110 to the horizontal axis .",
    "the boundary conditions for the specimen are set to be clamped on the bottom edge , i.e. @xmath111 . the top boundary is constrained horizontally @xmath112 and the displacement is controlled vertically @xmath113 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : simspec ] .",
    "two different set - ups are modeled for comparison .",
    "the first is a specimen where the inclusions have the same material properties as the rest of the specimen with elastic material properties ; @xmath114 mpa and @xmath115 .",
    "the second is a specimen where the young s modulus of the inclusions is 100 times greater than in the rest of the specimen .",
    "the maximum cohesive strengths are set to 1 mpa and the maximum critical separations are set to 0.02 mm in the cohesive sawtooth model giving a fracture energy of @xmath116 @xmath117 .",
    "note that these properties are the same for both set - ups .",
    "one of the major issues with this type of modeling is mesh dependency .",
    "however , if a large number of elements is used the mesh dependency is obviously reduced .",
    "furthermore , the compliance between all continuum elements introduce numerical issues which can be reduced by an increase of the elastic stiffness of the cohesive zone model sufficiently to minimize the compliance .        in the present model , the compliance is allowed to be initially zero and then gradually increase as the load is increased .",
    "damage initiation , and essentially crack propagation , is enabled by a decrease of the stiffness according to where the interfaces , as stated in the definition of the method , are given as the boundaries between all the continuum elements ( this is of course not a requirement , as a mix of continuous and discontinuous methods is also possible ) .",
    "thus , cracks are free to form , nucleate and propagate along the continuum element boundaries by nitsche s method instead of the standard approach of using cohesive elements , as in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for the first set - up , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup1 ] , the crack initiates as expected and then it propagates without considering the inclusions . in the second",
    "set - up , however , the crack is arrested by the stiffer inclusion boundary and deflects downwards around the lower right inclusion to finally to continue to propagate to the free edge of the specimen .",
    "it can be seen for both set - ups that there is virtually no compliance issues prior to any cracks forming . both simulations , thus shows the applicability of the modeling technique .",
    "in this paper , we have suggested an fe method which seamlessly blends the discontinuous galerkin method with classical cohesive zone models .",
    "there is no need for interface elements as the interelement stiffness is represented by a modification of the weak form .",
    "there is no need to identify threshold values for transitions between discretization approaches since the same bilinear form is used for all cases of interface stiffness .",
    "the method also directly allows for modeling cohesive zones between non  matching meshes , unlike the similar approach suggested previously in @xcite , which does not immediately generalize to this case .",
