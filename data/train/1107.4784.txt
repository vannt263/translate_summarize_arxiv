    "the later combine both holomorphic and anti - holomorphic conformal blocks in a consistent way to make modular covariant objects . on the sphere ,",
    "the @xmath2-point conformal block is represented graphically as in fig.[confblock ] , where @xmath3 is the conformal dimension of the primary field inserted at coordinate @xmath1 , and @xmath4 labels the contribution arising from the conformal family descending from a primary field with the conformal dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the global conformal invariance is @xmath5 , which may be used to fix three coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "so the independent variables are @xmath1 , @xmath9 , with the degrees of freedom @xmath10 for the @xmath2-point conformal blocks on the sphere .",

    "the decoupling of the virasoro null vectors can be implemented as differential equations for the conformal blocks . for the general case ,",
    "recursion relations have been proposed by zamolodchikov@xcite on the meromorphic structures of the conformal blocks either in complex @xmath12-plane or @xmath13-plane . however , in general , the global perspective of the sewing procedure for the conformal blocks was still not fully understood until recently when the agt duality @xcite had been proposed .",
    "agt conjecture relates 2d liouville conformal field theories to 4d @xmath14 supersymmetric gauge theories of the @xmath15 type .",
    "the main idea is coupling to the liouville field a @xmath16 field field is a gauge symmetry and can be fixed to any desired value . ] , then this system is dual to a @xmath17 superconformal 4d theory . in this case , the partition function by nekrasov instanton counting(nic)@xcite of the 4d @xmath18 theory is to be identified with the conformal blocks of the @xmath16 coupled liouville type .",
    "the liouville cft is characterized by a 2d one boson theory with center charge @xmath19 .",
    "finally , one can decouple the @xmath20 factor and obtain the instanton partition function of the @xmath21 theory which duals to liouville conformal blocks .",
    "liouville interaction breaks down the charge conservation explicitly and leads to the introduction of the screening charges . because of the existence of the screening charges , the conformal blocks of the liouville type is much more complicated than its counterpart of the @xmath16 free boson theory .",
    "however , the agt conjecture , if proven true , means that there exists an orthogonal basis upon which the @xmath22 conformal blocks are built . from the above reasoning , there exists a tree - like structure which describes the duality in coupling space of the @xmath14 4d superconformal linear quiver gauge theory .",
    "the primary objects for this tree - like structure is the `` bifundmental '' matter coupling , which , if translated correctly , should be represented by the inner products of the bra and ket descendant fields in 2d conformal families sandwiched by a `` primary '' vertex operator at position , say , @xmath23 .",
    "such kind of pants - like diagram can be sewed together to form a linear quiver diagram , which , on the 2d cft side , is just the @xmath2-point functions on the sphere for our consideration .",
    "of course , in the present context , we mean the @xmath0 2d cft .    at first sight",
    ", it seems that such duality does not bring in any conveniences .",
    "however , the nekrasov instanton counting on the 4d field theory shows a rather compact form for the summands which are completely factorized in `` momentum '' @xmath24 . and the summation is well organized into the combinatorial enumeration of the young tableuax .",
    "this simple structure implies liouville theory , in particular , the evaluation of the liouville conformal blocks , could be resolved by embedding it into a bigger system .",
    "so one may expect a new construction for the liouville conformal blocks from the corresponding nic .",
    "-point conformal block on @xmath25,height=144 ]    as pointed out by nakajima@xcite , the instanton counting for @xmath14 gauge theory is equivalent to the hilbert scheme of points on the corresponding seiberg - witten curve ( blow - up riemann surface)@xcite .",
    "this can be translated into a topological string description from physicists point of view . by invoking the d4-d0 brane setup@xcite for adhm construction@xcite of the instanton moduli space and the resolving process for ale singularities@xcite ,",
    "these indicate that the instanton counting is a counting for d0 branes in a toric calabi - yau 3-fold . actually , there are two kinds of d0 branes in the calabi - yau 3-fold , one is the regular d0 brane , which is in regular representation of @xmath26 , the center of the corresponding ade group .",
    "it carries no flux and can move freely on the riemann surface .",
    "the other is the fractional d0 brane , which is a d2 brane wrapping on a zero - sized two sphere .",
    "it is always attached to the ale singularity since it has a nontrivial monodromy while moving around the singularity .",
    "it is these fractional d0 branes that resolve the ale singularity , and leave fluxes on the blow - up riemann surface .",
    "this property ensures that one can identify these fractional instantons as `` anyons '' on the riemann surface .",
    "on the other hand , the regular ones are `` electric charged '' particles on the riemann surface .",
    "so the total counting is equvalent to solving the problem of `` electron gas '' system with insertions of anyons at the blow - up singularity on the riemann surface .",
    "this point of view is partialy included in dijkgraaf and vafa s article@xcite . for each pants of the pants decomposition for the ( punctured ) riemann surface",
    ", one can guess that the instanton partition function can be rewritten as summation over all the intermediate states passing through the sewn holes@xcite .",
    "for the interests of the present paper , we concern ourselves only with the special pants diagram that one of the tubes is replaced by the blow - up singularity .",
    "then the summand in the instanton partition function represents itself as an inner product of the bra and ket states , sandwiched by the anyonic vertex operator .",
    "these bra and ket states should come from the interacting `` electronic '' particles .",
    "a candidate description of the `` electronic gas '' system is the integrable system of multiple calogero - sutherland model , each living on a cycle .",
    "the whole ( punctured ) riemann surface , can be obtained by sewing together these pants on nonintersecting cycles .",
    "there are many efforts on relating the conformal blocks to the nic@xcite from various points of views , and these works confirm the validity of the agt duality .",
    "however , the explicit construction for the liouville conformal blocks has remained largely unclear until the recent work @xcite by alba , fateev , litvinov and tarnopolsky . in @xcite , they have put forward the agt duality in a more explicit form [ aflt ] & = & z_bif(|p, ; p , ) , here specifically for a free field realization , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the screening charge in the virasoro sector .",
    "the l.h.s . of eq([aflt ] ) is the pants - like ( with one of the tubes labeled by @xmath30 shrinks to a line ) conformal block .",

    "are the @xmath41-th part of the partition @xmath42 and the @xmath43-th part of the transpose partition @xmath44 respectively .",
    "( [ aflt ] ) means that the matrix elements of a special `` chiral vertex operator '' @xmath45 in a suitably chosen basis , can be translated into a 4d theory as an instanton contribution for a special bifundamental contribution of the nic . by sewing together pants - like diagrams",
    "one gets any desired duality diagrams in the coupling space of the linear quiver gauge theory .",
    "so , the checking of the agt duality reduces to the construction of the states @xmath46 , which we shall call the aflt states@xcite , with @xmath47 the young tableaux . here",
    "the @xmath37 s , the partitions of natural numbers , or equivalently represented by young tableaux , are labels for the orthogonal basis for the descendant fields ( verma modules ) in a @xmath0 conformal family from the 2d cft point of view . by definition ,",
    "the aflt states form a complete set of states for the family members in a given @xmath0 conformal family and the inner products between them , sandwiched by a vertex operator of the particular form , @xmath48 , at position , say , @xmath49 , is factorized exactly as the nic @xmath31 presented on the r.h.s . of ( [ aflt ] ) .",
    "the explicit formula , ( [ aflt ] ) , puts strong constraints on the possible forms of the aflt states and make a systematic construction of them unaccessible at first glance . in @xcite , only the explicit form of the state",

    "the agt conjecture , written in the form of ( [ aflt ] ) , strongly suggests that the @xmath0 conformal family is a hamiltonian system with @xmath46 the hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "so the construction of the aflt states becomes a quantum mechanical problem of solving the schrodinger equation .",
    "put things in this way , we propose a possible form of the hamiltonian @xmath55 and construct its eigenstates explicitly .",
    "we shall identify those eigenstates as the aflt states desired .",
    "for in all the cases we have checked , ( [ aflt ] ) is verified to be true , using the aflt states we have constructed .",
    "we shall present now as the main results of our present paper the explicit form of the hamiltonian @xmath55 along with the complete construction of the aflt states , @xmath46 .",

    "@xmath69 in @xcite , written in the form of @xmath0 , makes the virasoro symmetry manifest , but is not suitable for solving a perturbation theory with perturbation parameter @xmath70 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath55 written in terms of the interacting bi - jack polynomial system as in ( [ main2 ] ) , shows virasoro symmetry only implicitly , but makes the perturbation theory exactly solvable as we shall see soon after .",
    "the procedure is outlined as follows . on the 2d cft side",
    ", the @xmath71 theory can be represented as a theory of two independent scalars @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath72 part is essentially a free theory of timelike oscillators , while the scalar field @xmath74 is spacelike but engaged in a liouville type interaction .",
    "the two scalars can be linearly combined to form the `` light - cone '' scalars . @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the labeling @xmath77 of the basis vectors strongly suggests that there exist a bi - jack polynomial structure , plus possibly some interactions between these two sectors .",
    "that is , the `` free '' @xmath60 spectrums should be described by @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively , here @xmath80 denotes jack states related to young tableau @xmath37 .",

    "the next thing is to specify the interaction between these two sectors . strictly speaking",
    ", @xmath62 does not describe a free theory , since it also contains the interaction terms proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "but the new interaction term @xmath67 further mixes the @xmath84 s and the coupling is also a first order in @xmath83 .",
    "it is good to see that @xmath67 is strictly triangular with respect to the basis vectors of @xmath62 eigenstates .",
    "our method can be easily generalized to wider classes of integrable models , in which the interacting hamiltonian splits into two parts , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , representing respectively the shift of energies and the rotations ( mixings ) of states .",
    "the later keeps the eigenvalue spectrum untouched@xcite .    besides being triangular , the form of the interaction term is however much restricted , also by the virasoro symmetry .",
    "since the total hamiltonian is of the form @xmath0 , an `` interaction energy operator '' @xmath67 is needed to make the `` full energy operator '' @xmath87 the combination of @xmath88 s and @xmath89 s only .",
    "once the hamiltonian structure is determined , then the construction of the hamiltonian eigenstate @xmath46 is just a quantum mechanical problem . @xmath62 and",
    "@xmath55 share the same eigenvalue spectrum , but only the eigenstates of @xmath55 , represented by @xmath46 s , form a complete set of basis vectors for the @xmath0 conformal family .",
    "we have checked by examples the corresponding agt duality formula , ( [ aflt ] ) up to level 4 , and have found that indeed nekrasov instanton counting can be reproduced with this construction , ( [ main2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , we have also checked more general cases and all get positive answers . but those more general results will appear elsewhere due to lacking of space to include them in this paper .",
    "the insertions of the screening charges play an important role in checking the agt duality .",
    "however , in the present work we concern ourselves only with the cases in which the screening charges can be detached away from the vertex operator @xmath45 and moved on to act on the aflt states ( similar to the felder s brst operators)@xcite .",
    "the more general cases in which screening charges can not be moved away from @xmath45 will be under our future studies .",
    "it is well known that it is possible to map the liouville theory to the analytic continuation of the calogero - sutherland(cs ) model , which was originally and in most cases considered to be a theory with the parameter @xmath90 , while in the liouville case @xmath91 is required .",
    "some explanation is given in @xcite .",
    "the physical space of the cs model are created by jack polynomials , which are symmetric functions studied in great detail in mathematics and physics literatures@xcite .",
    "the integrability of the cs model may be derived in different ways , e.g. , from the knowledge of the hidden @xmath92 symmetry of the model .",
    "a recursion relation related to the virasoro singular vectors and an integral representation based on it has appeared recently in @xcite , in which more references can be found on the subjects of the cs model and the jack symmetric functions .",
    "it should be stressed again that for @xmath90 , there is no null vectors in the cs model .",
    "so the `` null '' vectors are not the true null vectors of the cs model , since the virasoro algebra based on which the null vectors are constructed is not the true conformal algebra of the cs model in that case . but for @xmath91 , yes , there are null vectors in the cs model .",
    "it is possible to describe the @xmath93 theory in terms of the jack polynomials considered as analytic continuation from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "there is another hint that the @xmath93 theory has something to do with @xmath91 cs model .",
    "it can be found from the nekrasov partition function , in which each term in the summation can be written in the form of the carlsson - okounkov formula@xcite , for the special cases when no screening charges are inserted .",
    "carlsson - okounkov formula is a formula for the inner products between the bra jack states and the ket jack states sandwiched with a modified vertex operator .",
    "this extraordinary formula is of great help in checking the agt duality with our construction for the orthogonal basis vectors @xmath46 s defined in ( [ aflt ] ) .",
    "we notice that the construction we found shares many similarities with the construction of the jack functions themselves .",
    "namely , we take the state @xmath96 as the mother state and its descendants are constructed in such a manner that two partitions are `` squeezed '' into other pairs .",
    "the squeezing does not change the total level of the two partitions , but does make the inner products of the descendants a triangular form .",
    "although the 4d to 2d duality has just begun to be understood , it has been known for sometime that 2d conformal blocks can be equivalently described as insertions of wilson lines in 3d pure chern - simons topological gauge theory .",
    "in fact , we can interpret the @xmath2-point conformal block represented by fig.1 as a wilson line insertion inside a three - ball .",
    "the path integral in chern - simons - witten gauge theory thus creates a state living on the boundary of the three ball , which is punctured @xmath25 .",
    "so it should not be a too big surprise that 2d conformal field theory has something to do with higher dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "taking into account that jack symmetric polynomials can be taken as some special limit of the two parameter macdonald symmetric polynomials , one natural guess is that our construction can be generalized to the case of macdonald symmetric polynomials . in that case",
    "there should be a 5d to 3d duality .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "our general formalism on the construction of the aflt states is presented in the introduction . in section 2",
    ", we explore the general structure of the @xmath0 conformal family .",
    "we found in some cases it is more convenient to work with the bi - jack function basis .",
    "section 3 contains the major derivation of our construction .",
    "section 4 is the conclusion . and in appendix",
    "a the explicit construction of the aflt states up to level 3 is presented .",
    "we are dealing with a 4d n=2 @xmath18 linear quiver gauge theory coupled to special bi - fundmental matter in a superconformal way . according to the standard agt duality dictionary ,",
    "the corresponding 2d conformal block is of the @xmath0 type , which reproduces the instanton part of the nekrasov partition function for the @xmath18 theory .",
    "there are two sets of young diagrams which measure the partitions of the instantons .",
    "if one wants to extract the virasoro basis of the conformal blocks , one need to factor out the @xmath16 factor .    in this section we shall mainly explore the hilbert space for the @xmath0 theory and find the requirements that the energy operator @xmath55 should meet .",
    "our procedure depends heavily on the nekrasov instanton counting formula written more suitably for the construction of the conformal blocks , ( [ aflt ] ) .",
    "first , the 2d @xmath16 conformal block , realized in terms of the oscillators of the scaler field @xmath97 , is essentially of free theory with center charge @xmath98 .",
    "the zero modes can be integrated out trivially and does not play any significant role here .",
    "the vertex operators for @xmath97 , take a peculiar form @xmath99 here , @xmath100 means the positive ( negative ) mode part of the scalar field @xmath97 .",
    "although the above vertex operator is not the standard one in 2d cft , its contribution to the conformal block can be easily read off and factored out .",
    "second , the @xmath101 part is a liouville conformal field theory of the @xmath102 scalar field and is more complicated because of the existence of the screening charges .",
    "we have the following mode expansion for the scalar fields @xmath102 and @xmath72 ,    [ scalars ] ( z)&=&q+c_0 ( z)+_nz , n0z^n , + ( z)&=&+a_0 ( z)+_nz , n0 z^n , + & = & _ n+m,0 ,  ( c_-n)^ = c_n ,  = + & = & _ n+m,0 ,  ( a_-n)^ = -a_n ,  = .",
