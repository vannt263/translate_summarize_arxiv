    "measurements using jet final states have been of great interest to both experimentalists and theorists for the following reasons .",
    "first , among high @xmath7 physics processes at a hadron collider , jet production has the largest cross section .",
    "therefore , jet production can test perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) with the highest reach in energy and rapidity ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "second , measurements at the tevatron , which are complementary to the measurements by hera and fixed target experiments , may constrain parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the region of large @xmath9 and medium - to - large @xmath10 and reduce uncertainties on the gluon , @xmath2 , and @xmath11 quark pdfs .",
    "measurements will have greater impacts on pdfs when the uncertainties on the cross sections due to variation of renormalization and factorization scales ( pqcd uncertainties ) are much smaller compared to the uncertainties from existing pdfs , _",
    "e.g. _ measurements of inclusive jet cross section .",
    "third , these measurements not only provide stringent tests of the standard model ( sm ) physics , but also probe physics beyond the sm .",
    "the production of @xmath0 or @xmath1 in conjunction with inclusive or heavy - flavor jets is one of the major backgrounds to searches for sm higgs , susy , and other models .",
    "measurements of the cross sections of these processes decrease uncertainties on the estimation of backgrounds .",
    "the angular distributions of jet events , which are not very sensitive to pdfs , can also probe the presence of new physics .",
    "section  [ sec : def ] briefly describes the jet definition and reconstruction algorithms used at the tevatron .",
    "sections  [ sec : incj][sec : bjetshape ] discuss the results of these analyses .",
    "section  [ sec : con ] gives the conclusion .",
    "jets are collimated sprays of particles originating from quarks or gluons .",
    "the most common jet reconstruction algorithms at the tevatron are midpoint cone and @xmath12 . the midpoint cone and @xmath12 algorithms cluster objects based on their proximity in the geometry and momentum space , respectively .",
    "the midpoint cone algorithm starts from objects above an energy threshold ( seeds ) and sums the four - momentum vectors of all objects within a cone of radius @xmath13 . ] around the seed .",
    "the total four - momentum vector of these objects defines a new jet axis .",
    "the process is iterated until the updated jet axis is within a tolerance from the previous jet axis ; a stable cone is formed .",
    "then , additional seeds are added at the midpoints between all pairs of stable cones whose separation is less than @xmath14 and the clustering procedure is repeated using these additional seeds .",
    "finally , geometrically overlapping cones are split or merged depending on the amount of shared momentum .",
    "the @xmath12 algorithm starts by considering every object as a protojet and calculates @xmath15 for each protojet and @xmath16 for each pair of protojets . and",
    "@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the distance between the two protojets in the @xmath19 space and @xmath20 is a parameter that controls the size of the jet . ] all @xmath15 and @xmath16 are then collected into a single sorting list .",
    "if the smallest in this list is @xmath15 , protojet @xmath21 is promoted to a jet and removed from the list .",
    "if the smallest is @xmath16 , protojets @xmath21 and @xmath22 are combined into a single protojet .",
    "the procedure is iterated until the list is empty .",
    "the cone algorithm has simpler underlying event and multiple interaction corrections while the @xmath12 algorithm is less sensitive to higher order perturbative qcd effects .",
    "more discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of these two algorithms are in ref .  @xcite .",
    "three levels of energies are defined , ( i ) parton level : the true energy of the parent parton ( quark or gluon ) , ( ii ) particle level : the total true energy of all particles contained in a jet , including underlying event and products of fragmentation and hadronization , but excluding the energy from multiple @xmath23 interactions per crossing , ( iii ) detector level : energy measured in the calorimeters .",
    "the cross sections discussed here are presented as functions of particle - level energy .",
    "calorimeters may under- or over - measure the energies of particles due to finite resolution , non - uniformity , and inefficiency of detector .",
    "programs that provide theoretical predictions of cross sections at the next - to leading order ( nlo ) typically do not include parton showering .",
    "therefore , in order to have a valid comparison between data and theory , corrections have to be applied . for measurements in data , corrections of energy from the detector to the particle level follow the procedures described in ref .",
    "@xcite.% ( 50% ) of the jet energy at 50  gev and @xmath24 % ( 20% ) at 400  gev for cdf(d ) .",
    "] for theory predictions , corrections of energy from the parton to the particle level are obtained by comparing pythia or herwig mc with parton shower and fragmentation switched on vs. switched off.20%  at 50  gev and drops quickly to below 5 %  when energy is above 100  gev . ]",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , inclusive jet production cross section provides constraints on the gluon pdf .",
    "the inclusive jet cross section from tevatron run  i  @xcite had excess in data with respect to nlo predictions at high @xmath25 .",
    "data had been included later in the global fits of cteq6 and mrst2001 and preferred larger contribution of gluons at high @xmath10 . at run",
    "ii , cdf and d  have measured inclusive jet cross section with midpoint cone  @xcite and @xmath12 algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the run ii measurements have extended the cross section reach significantly both in @xmath25  and rapidity ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the midpoint seeds are added in the cone algorithm in order to reduce sensitivity to non - perturbative effects , such as radiation of soft gluons .",
    "the cross section is measured as a function of corrected jet @xmath25  ( to the particle level ) , in 56 bins of jet rapidity .",
    "dominant sources of systematic uncertainties are jet energy scale and jet energy resolution .",
    "measurements in data are compared to nlo predictions and cteq6.1 m pdfs for cdf , cteq6.5 m pdfs for d .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) are set to @xmath28 for cdf and @xmath29 for d .",
    "figure  [ fig : incj1 ] and figure  [ fig : incj2 ] show the ratios of run ii data to theory using the cone algorithm and @xmath12 algorithm , respectively .",
    "although the pdfs and scales used are not exactly the same , all three measurements have a similar trend : at high @xmath25  and large @xmath30 ( equivalent to large @xmath10 ) , the data prefer smaller values of cross section than the theory prediction .",
    "the cdf @xmath12 and d  cone measurements are already included in the global fit of mstw2008 pdfs ; not only the uncertainties of gluon component have decreased , but also the central values .",
    "there is an ongoing effort to include the cdf cone measurement and update cteq pdfs as well",

    "measurements of dijet mass spectra provide an alternate method to constrain pdfs .",
    "in addition , new particles predicted by physics beyond sm may appear as resonances in the dijet mass spectra .",
    "these new particles and decays include : ( i ) @xmath31 ( quark compositeness  @xcite ) , ( ii ) axigluon or coloron @xmath32 ( chiral color model  @xcite ) , ( iii ) color - octet techni-@xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) @xmath32 or @xmath35 ( extended and topcolor - assisted technicolor  @xcite ) , ( iv ) randall sundrum graviton @xmath32 or @xmath35 ( warped extra dimension  @xcite ) , ( v ) @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) @xmath38 ( grand unified theories gut  @xcite ) , ( vi ) diquark @xmath39 or @xmath40 ( @xmath41 gut  @xcite ) .",

    "the d   limits are work in progress .",
    "an excess in data may indicate presence of new physics , but may also imply that the pdfs have to be updated ; matrix elements for hard scattering processes and pdfs are entangled in the calculation of absolute production cross sections .",

    "while most jet cross section measurements have major uncertainties from the jet energy scale , this measurement also suffers from the uncertainty on the background estimate at large jet @xmath25   and high jet multiplicity ; this is the region where top pair production dominates .",
    "measured results are compared with nlo predictions from mcfm and two different schemes of interfacing leading - order ( lo ) matrix element with parton shower generators and jet matching ( mlm : alpgen+herwig+mlm , smpr : madgraph+pythia+ckkw ) .",
    "both lo and nlo predict well the cross section ratios of different jet multiplicity @xmath59 .",
    "the nlo predictions also have good agreement with the measurement , both in shape and absolute cross section , as functions of jet multiplicity and jet @xmath60 .",
    "as expected , the lo tends to under - predict the absolute cross section . among the two lo schemes ,",
    "smpr has better agreement at low @xmath60  due to a better underlying event model in pythia .",
    "the production of @xmath0 boson in association with heavy - flavor jets is one of the major backgrounds to searches for new physics ( _ e.g. _ higgs ) .",
    "a sample of @xmath0 boson with heavy - flavor jets may be obtained by requiring the jets to contain either secondary vertices ( secvtx tagging ) or a soft electron or muon ( soft lepton tagging ) .",
    "cdf has measured the @xmath0 + @xmath2 jet production cross section , where the measurement is proportional to the number of @xmath2 jets and restricted to the kinematic range : a charged lepton with @xmath61  @xmath62  and @xmath63 , a neutrino with @xmath64  @xmath62 , and one or two jets regardless of species with @xmath65  @xmath66  and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "this definition of cross section has been chosen in order to minimize uncertainties on the acceptance .",
    "the jets are tagged by ultra - tight secvtx  @xcite .- tagging efficiency . ]",
    "the fraction of tagged jets originating from @xmath2 quarks is extracted by fitting the mass reconstructed at the secondary vertices to templates of light , @xmath3 , and @xmath2-flavor jets ( see figure  [ fig : wbc ] ) .",

    "cdf and d  have also studied samples of @xmath0 boson with single charm candidate by tagging the charm quark with soft muon tagging  @xcite .",
    "while secvtx and soft lepton taggings could help separating heavy - flavor from light - flavor jets , a separation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 requires more advanced analysis techniques , such as neural network .",
    "nevertheless , one could employ the fact that in @xmath0 + single charm events , the muon from semileptonic decays of @xmath3 hadrons and the charged lepton from @xmath0 decays are oppositely charged , therefore , with a large asymmetry in the number of oppositely - charged vs. same - charged events , while background from @xmath70 or @xmath71 has zero asymmetry .",
    "cdf has measured the absolute cross section for @xmath72 , @xmath73  @xmath62 , and @xmath74 to be @xmath75  pb . d  has measured the cross - section ratio , @xmath76 for jet @xmath25  @xmath77  @xmath62  and @xmath78 , to be @xmath79 , and also measured the ratios as a function of jet @xmath25 . both experiments have found good agreement between data and lo or nlo predictions within uncertainties .",
    "since the dominant process of @xmath80 production is @xmath81 , future @xmath80 cross section measurements with reduced uncertainties may constrain the @xmath11 quark pdf .",
    "the measurements of @xmath1 boson production in association with inclusive jets contain only small amount of background from mis - identified leptons and are one of the cleanest channels to test pqcd .",
    "cdf has measured the @xmath1 + jet cross section as functions of jet multiplicity and jet @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "in addition , d  has measured the cross section as a function of @xmath1 boson kinematics : @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and the angular separation between @xmath1 and jets : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "both cdf and d  have seen good agreements between data and theory when nlo predictions are available .",
    "d  has also compared their results with a number of lo matrix element generators and pure parton showering programs , such as alpgen , sherpa , pythia , herwig .",
    "overall , the lo mc programs under - predict the cross sections , but the programs that interface matrix element generator with parton shower mc have better agreement with data in shapes .",
    "the results of these comparisons may provide inputs to the mc generation for lhc experiments .",
    "cdf has measured the ratio of @xmath1+@xmath2 jet cross section to inclusive @xmath1 cross section  @xcite .",
    "measuring the ratio , instead of the absolute cross section , makes the systematic uncertainties from luminosity and lepton identification largely cancel .",
    "analysis requires at least one jet tagged by the standard secvtx algorithm and the @xmath2 fraction is extracted by fitting the secondary vertex mass as described in section  [ sec : wbc ] . the per jet cross section ratio , @xmath87 , for @xmath88  @xmath66 , @xmath89 , @xmath90  @xmath46 , has been measured to be @xmath91 .",
    "although the measured results are consistent with predictions from mcfm , the predictions have a large dependence on scales , which is unexpected for nlo calculations .",
    "for example , the cross section ratio at @xmath92 for @xmath93 is a factor of two of the prediction for @xmath94 .",
    "several investigations show that mcfm does not provide full nlo predictions for one of the production diagrams : @xmath95 when only one @xmath2 jet is observed .",
    "quarks are collinear , they may be reconstructed as single @xmath2 jet . when the two @xmath2 quarks are well separated , one of them may be outside of the detector acceptance . ]",
    "similar to the case of @xmath0 + @xmath2 cross section , nlo calculations are available , but not yet implemented in an mc program that allows user - defined kinematic requirements .",

    "updates with more data will benefit the @xmath104 + heavy flavor measurements and also push the other analyses to a wider kinematic range .",
    "in addition , full nlo predictions for @xmath104 + heavy flavor in a user - friendly mc program will give more sensible data and theory comparisons .",
    "as the qcd productions of these processes are well measured and studied , our chance of discovery will be enhanced due to the better understanding of backgrounds .",
