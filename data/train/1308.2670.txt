    "the existence of vast halos of unseen _ dark _ matter surrounding each galaxy has long been proposed to explain the surprisingly large motions of the _ baryonic _ matter that we can see ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "dark - matter - only simulations of structure formation lead us to expect that these dark matter halos should have density distributions that are described by a universal radial profile @xcite with a variety of triaxial shapes @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of baryons in the simulations tends to soften the triaxiality of the dark matter in the inner regions of the halo ( e.g. , as the disk forms , * ? ? ? * ) and can alter the radial profile through a combination of adiabatic contraction and energetic feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence , measurements of the shape , orientation , radial profile , and extent of dark matter halos provides information about the formation of these vast structures , as well as the messy baryonic processes that continue to shape them .",
    "the milky way is the best candidate for such a detailed study of a dark matter halo since we can resolve large samples of stellar tracers .",
    "thousands of blue horizontal branch stars selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have been used to probe the milky way mass out to tens of kpc ( sdss , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and estimates with combined tracers extend to 150kpc @xcite .",
    "this approach assumes that the tracers represent a random sampling of phase - mixed orbits drawn from a smooth distribution function , however large area surveys have revealed the existence of large - scale spatial inhomogeneities in the form of giant stellar streams @xcite , demonstrating that a significant fraction of the stellar halo is neither randomly sampled nor is fully phase - mixed .",
    "a complimentary approach to measuring the mass distribution is to instead take advantage of the _ non_-random nature of the galaxy s stellar distribution and utilize the knowledge that stars in streams were once all part of the same object .",
    "such approaches can require orders of magnitude fewer tracers than a randomly sampled population to achieve comparable accuracy .",
    "one method is to simply fit orbits to observations of streams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the assumption that debris traces a single orbit is actually incorrect ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and changes in orbital properties along debris streams can lead to systematic biases in measurements of the galactic potential @xcite . @xcite",
    "recently demonstrated that this bias is equally problematic for the very thinnest , coldest streams , whose observed properties may be indistinguishable from those of the parent orbit ( e.g. such as the globular cluster , gd1  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as for the much more extended and hotter streams ( e.g. such as debris from the sagittarius dwarf galaxy  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where offsets from a single orbit are clearly apparent .",
    "one way to address these biases is to run self - consistent n - body simulations of satellite destruction in a variety of potentials with the aim of simultaneously constraining both the properties of the satellite and the milky way .",
    "many studies of the sagittarius debris system ( hereafter sgr ) have adopted this approach , with the most recent work attempting to place constraints on the triaxiality and orientation of the dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "the promise of near - future data sets including full phase - space information has also inspired other approaches .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrate that the distribution of energy and entropy in debris , respectively , will be minimized only for a correct assumption of the form of the galactic potential .",
    "@xcite examine the distribution of debris in action - angle co - ordinates and show that stars stripped from the same disrupted object must lie along a single line in angle - frequency space , providing a constraint that can be used as a potential measure .    in this _",
    "letter _ we re - examine and update a complimentary approach to using tidal debris as a potential measure ( originally proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the context of current and near - future observational capabilities , and apply it to a simulation of the sgr debris system . in section [ sec : context ]",

    "sec : method ] we present the updated potential measure and test it with synthetic observations of simulated sgr debris . in section [ sec : discussion ] we highlight the advantages and shortcomings of this method .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the method presented in section [ sec : method ] takes advantage of three distinct developments : ( i ) the demonstration of a technique for deriving distances to individual rr lyrae stars with 2% accuracies ( section [ sec : spitzer ] ) ; ( ii ) the prospect of proper motion measurements of the same stars with @xmath010  @xmath1as / yr precision ( section [ sec : gaia ] ) ; and ( iii ) the tracing of debris associated with sgr around the entire galaxy ( section [ sec : sgr ] )      there is a long tradition for using rr lyrae stars in the galaxy to study structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , substructure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and distances to satellite galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , studies of rr lyrae at optical wavelengths are limited by both metallicity effects on the intrinsic brightness of these stars and variable extinction along the line of sight . moreover",
    ", systematic differences between instruments make it difficult to tie observations across the sky to a common scale .    at longer wavelengths ,",
    "rr lyrae promise tighter constraints on distances . @xcite",
    "have recently shown , using five stars with trigonometric parallaxes measured by hubble @xcite , that the dispersion in the mid - ir period - luminosity ( pl ) relation ( first mapped by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at wavelengths measurable by nasa s _ spitzer _ mission is @xmath00.03  mag .",
    "this implies that it is possible to use _",
    "spitzer _ to determine distances that are good to @xmath2 for individual rr lyrae stars out to @xmath060  kpc ( _ spitzer _ s limit for detecting and measuring rr lyrae ) . for comparison ,",
    "distance measurements of blue horizontal branch stars typically achieve @xmath010 - 15% uncertainties ( if appropriate color measurements are available , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the _ gaia _ satellite @xcite is an astrometric mission which aims to measure the positions of billions of stars with 10 - 100  @xmath1as accuracies .",
    "combined with expected proper motion accuracies , this will enable full six - dimensional phase - space maps of the galaxy with @xmath310% distance errors for heliocentric distances of up to @xmath06  kpc for rr lyrae stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaia_errors ] shows the _ gaia _ end - of - mission distance and tangential velocity error estimates for rr lyrae . within 2  kpc , _ gaia _ will measure distances to these stars with better than 2% accuracy  rr lyrae in this volume can be used to test and calibrate the _ spitzer _",
    "pl relation described above . beyond the 2  kpc threshold , the mid - ir pl relation for",
    "rr lyrae will provide better distance measurements .",
    "the combination of _ spitzer _ and _ gaia _ data will extend the `` horizon '' of where precise , six - dimensional phase - space maps of the galaxy are possible from @xmath310  kpc to 60  kpc .",
    "this enormous increase in volume will greatly refine data on debris systems in the halo .",
    "sgr was discovered serendipitously during a radial velocity survey of the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "signatures of extensive stellar streams associated with sgr have since been mapped across the sky in carbon stars @xcite , m giants selected from 2mass @xcite , main sequence turnoff stars from sdss @xcite , and rr lyrae in the catalina sky survey @xcite .",

    "* hereafter lm10 ) combined all the ( then ) current data on the sgr debris to constrain both a model of its evolution and the potential in which it orbits .",
    "( note that new observational work by @xcite suggest that the trailing tail of sgr debris does not match the lm10 model . )",
    "figure [ fig : lm10 ] shows particle positions from the final time - step of the lm10 n - body simulation of dwarf satellite disruption along the expected sgr orbit in the best - fitting milky way halo model .",

    "spitzer _ and _ gaia _ measurements of distances and proper motions of rr lyrae in the sgr debris will open up new avenues for potential constraints .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaia_errors ] shows that a 2% distance error is smaller than the distance range in the stream ( top panel ) .",
    "similarly , _ gaia _",
    "proper motion error estimates correspond to tangential velocity errors less than the velocity dispersion for much of the stream ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the next section outlines a new method to take advantage of this information .",
    "with access to 6d information for stars in a tidal stream , each star becomes a powerful potential measure by exploiting the fact that the stars must have come from the same progenitor : if the orbits of the stars and progenitor are integrated _ backwards _ in a a potential that accurately models the milky way , the stars should recombine with the progenitor ( imagine watching satellite destruction in  rewind \" ) .",
    "if the potential is incorrect , the orbits of the stars will diverge from that of the progenitor and thus will not be recaptured by the satellite system ( figure  [ fig : ps_distance ] ) .",
    "this approach was originally proposed by @xcite and was tested on the proposed characteristics of the space interferometry mission @xcite .",
    "below we present an updated version of the algorithm : the promise of 2% distances to rr lyrae stars ( see section [ sec : spitzer ] ) enables a direct measurement ( rather than approximate estimate , as previously assumed ) of the position of a star within its debris structure .",

    "the same 10 particles are used in both figures , so the initial conditions are identical .",
    "horizontal ( dashed ) line shows @xmath16 , for reference.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]      quantifying this method requires a sample of stars with known full space kinematics @xmath17 ( e.g. , measurements of all position and velocity components for these stars _ today _ at @xmath18 ) , the orbital parameters for the progenitor system @xmath19 , and a functional form for the potential , @xmath20 . for a given set of potential parameters , @xmath21 , the orbits of the stars and",
    "progenitor are integrated backwards for several gigayears . at each timestep @xmath22 , for each particle @xmath23 , a set of normalized , relative phase - space coordinates are computed @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the phase - space coordinates for the particles and progenitor , respectively .",
    "these definitions require an estimate of the mass of the satellite , @xmath27 , which , combined with the orbital radius of the satellite , @xmath28 , and the computed enclosed mass of the potential within @xmath28 , @xmath29 , sets the instantaneous tidal radius and escape velocity , @xmath30 these quantities are computed at each time step to take the time dependence into account , neglecting mass - loss from the satellite .",
    "qualitatively , when the distance in this normalized six - dimensional space , @xmath31 , the star is likely recaptured by the satellite ( in the absence of errors , we find that @xmath090% of the initially bound particles come within this limit when integrating all orbits backwards ) .",
    "@xcite imposed a similar condition as a hard boundary and maximized the number of recaptured particles in a given backwards - integration .",
    "what follows is a description of an updated procedure with a statistically - motivated choice for an objective function .    for each star , @xmath23 , the phase - space distance , @xmath32 ,",
    "is computed at each timestep @xmath33 , and the vector with the minimum phase - space distance is stored @xmath34 thus , the matrix @xmath35 contains these minimum phase - space distance vectors for each star , where @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "intuitively , the variance of the distribution of minimum phase - space vectors will be larger for orbits integrated in an incorrect potential relative to the distribution computed from the ` true ' orbital history of the stars : in an incorrect potential , the orbits of the stars relative to the orbit of the progenitor spread out in phase space .",
    "thus , the _ generalized variance _ of the distribution  computed for a given set of potential parameters , @xmath37  is a natural choice for the scalar objective function , @xmath38 , used in constraining the potential of the milky way @xmath39      the lm10 simulation data ( see section [ sec : sgr ] ) is a perfect test - bed for evaluating the effectiveness of this method .",
    "we start by extracting both particle data and the satellite orbital parameters from the present - day snapshot of the simulation data .",
    "we then `` observe '' a sample of 100 stars from the first leading and trailing wraps of the stream . the radial velocity and distance errors",
    "are drawn from gaussians ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and the proper motion errors are computed from the expected _ gaia _ error curve .",
    "the generalized variance defines a convex function over which we optimize four of the six logarithmic potential parameters : @xmath42 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 , and @xmath15 ( @xmath11 and @xmath43 are degenerate with combinations of the other parameters ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : objective ] shows one - dimensional slices of the objective function produced by varying each of the potential parameters by @xmath44 around the true values and holding all others fixed .",
    "the values of the objective function ( vertical axis ) are not interesting but note the minima around the truth ( 1.0).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        in anticipation of extending the above method to include a true likelihood function , we use a parallelized markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm @xcite to sample from our objective function .",
    "we use the median value of the converged sample distribution as a point estimate for the potential parameters . to assess the uncertainty in the derived halo parameters",
    ", we sample 100 stars 100 times and estimate the potential parameters with each resampling .",
    "figure  [ fig : bootstrap ] shows the recovered parameters for each sample and demonstrates the power of this method : a moderately sized sample of rr lyrae alone places strong constraints on the shape and mass of the galaxy s dark matter halo . from the covariance matrix derived from the distribution of points in figure  [ fig : bootstrap ]",
    ", we find the mean recovered parameters and one - sigma deviations to be @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 degrees , and @xmath48 km / s .",
    "the strengths of this method stem from its simplicity : it requires only a rough estimate of the satellite mass @xmath49 combined with backwards integration of orbits . _",
    "rewinder _ does not assume that stream stars follow a single orbit and instead _ relies _ on the fact that each star is on a different orbit .",
    "there are also no assumptions made about of the internal distribution of satellite stars .",
    "thus , _ rewinder _ is applicable to any debris that is known to come from a single object and not restricted to the coldest tidal streams . in principle , it could also be applied to the vast stellar debris _",
    "clouds _ that have been discovered ( e.g. , the triangulum - andromeda and hercules - aquila clouds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even stars that have only associations in orbital properties and do not form a coherent spatial structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the method trivially extends to combining constraints from multiple debris systems at once by simply integrating all debris from several satellites simultaneously , with @xmath32 defined appropriately for each star .",
    "it is also important to characterize the the limitations of this method .",
    "firstly , the measurement errors for rr lyraes associated with the very coldest streams ( e.g. , the globular clusters pal5 and gd1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will likely be too large to resolve the minute differences in orbital properties between the debris and satellite .",
    "second , the present prescription neglects orbital evolution ( e.g. , dynamical friction ) and scattering of stream stars due to the potential of the satellite .",
    "preliminary simulations ( to be fully explored in forthcoming work ) suggest that these two points can be neglected for satellite masses between @xmath0@xmath50 and @xmath0@xmath51 .",
    "lastly , the current version of the algorithm relies on knowledge of the current position and velocity of the parent satellite , which may not be available ( e.g. , the orphan stream ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper presents an algorithm for measuring the galactic potential that anticipates combined data from the _ spitzer _ and _ gaia _ satellite missions which promise precise , full phase - space measurements of rr lyrae stars in the halo of our galaxy . when applied to a sample of 100 stars ( with realistic observational errors ) drawn from the @xcite n - body simulation of the destruction of the sgr dwarf satellite , _ rewinder _",
    "recovers the depth , shape , and orientation of the dark matter potential to within a few percent .",
    "while the tests presented in this paper are very simple , the accuracy of potential recovery promised by such a small sample of stars provides strong motivation for further theoretical work to : 1 ) develop a robust generative model that utilizes the concepts demonstrated by _ rewinder _ ; 2 ) investigate the power of using multiple debris structures ; and 3 ) examine how _ rewinder _ might work with less accurate measurements or missing dimensions .",
    "our results also motivate an observational campaign with _",
