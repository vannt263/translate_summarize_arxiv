    "there is extensive experimental evidence , eg .  in refs .",
    "@xcite , that a hot and strongly interacting medium is formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is expected that color screening of the quark - antiquark binding potential within such a medium would render quarkonium formation less likely  @xcite , an effect colloquially referred to as `` melting '' of the bound state .",
    "since quarkonium states with stronger binding energies would melt at higher temperatures than the more weakly bound states , measuring the yields of different quarkonium states may reveal a sequential suppression pattern , thus serving as a thermometer for the medium  @xcite .",
    "although the suppression of charmonia was anticipated as a key signature of the quark - gluon plasma formation  @xcite , later studies revealed that several concurrent effects , such as recombination of uncorrelated @xmath4 pairs in the medium , cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects and feed - down from higher - mass states , complicate the interpretation of the results  @xcite .",
    "bottomonia , on the other hand , are less affected by recombination at top rhic energies , and cnm effects are also expected to be moderate at mid - rapidity .",
    "thus the measurements of the @xmath0(@xmath5s ) states provide a cleaner probe of the strongly interacting medium .",
    "recent results from star  @xcite show that in central au+au collisions at @xmath6 gev , the @xmath0(1s+2s+3s ) production is suppressed to an extent that can not be explained by cnm effects only . in the same study the yields of the excited states are consistent with a complete suppression . since the energy density in central u+u collisions",
    "is estimated to be about 20% higher on the average than that in central au+au collisions at @xmath6 gev  @xcite , studies of quarkonium production in u+u collisions can provide further tests of the sequential suppression hypothesis .",
    "recent installation of the muon telescope detector ( mtd )  @xcite , on the other hand , opened the door for precision measurements of quarkonia at star via the dimuon decay channel .",
    "the star detector complex  @xcite provides clean identification of electrons at mid - rapidity ( @xmath7 ) in the full azimuth angle . star collected data in u+u collisions at @xmath1 gev triggered by high - energy electrons ( or positrons ) with an integrated luminosity of 263.4 @xmath8 .",
    "the analysis of this data , briefly recapitulated here , is described in details in ref .",
    "the tracks of the electron candidates are reconstructed in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , and then matched with energy deposits in the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) .",
    "electron identification is carried out in the tpc based on fractional energy loss , and in the bemc based on the shape of the electromagnetic shower .",
    "electron candidates have to have their energy - to - momentum ratio close to unity .",
    "identified electron and positron candidates are then paired in order to reconstruct the invariant mass of the @xmath0 candidates . the combinatorial background is then reconstructed using like - sign electron ( positron ) pairs . since drell - yan processes and open @xmath9 production yield correlated backround in the signal region , combinatorial background can not be simply subtracted to get the signal . instead",
    ", a simultaneous fit is applied on the unlike - sign and like - sign invariant mass data .",
    "the former is constructed as a sum of the three @xmath0(@xmath5s ) peaks , the correlated and the combinatorial background .",
    "a priori knowledge on the shapes of the signal and background shapes were obtained from simulations  @xcite in order to reduce the number of free parameters in the fit .",

    "we use the nuclear modification factor to quantify suppression , defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total inelastic cross - section of the u+u ( @xmath12+@xmath12 ) collisions , and @xmath13 denotes the @xmath0production cross - section in u+u ( @xmath12+@xmath12 ) collisions .",

    "the 95% upper confidence bound is shown for @xmath0(2s+3s ) measured in au+au collisions . ]",
    "measurements in the dielectron channel suffer from the electron bremsstrahlung tail that causes the higher mass states to give contribution to the peak region of lower mass states .",
    "the advantage of @xmath18 measurements is that muons are less affected by bremsstrahlung , thus it is less of a challenge to separate the different @xmath0 states with comparable statistics . the muon telescope detector ( mtd ) , completed in 2014 , is designed for precision measurements of quarkonia production via the dimuon channel .",
    "it is installed outside the solenoidal magnet of star , covering 45% of the azimuth angle within the pseudorapidity range @xmath19 .",

    "the result suggests that the excited states may not be as strongly suppressed at rhic as at the lhc , although the errors are large .",
    "measurements of @xmath0(1s+2s+3s ) and @xmath0(1s ) production in u+u collisions at @xmath1 gev consolidate the trends observed in au+au collisions and extend them toward higher @xmath2values . we observe a significant suppression of the @xmath0(1s+2s+3s )",
    "signal in heavy - ion collisions at rhic top energies . the suppression of the @xmath0(1s ) state in central heavy - ion collisions",
    "is also confirmed by the new u+u data .",
    "new preliminary measurements of @xmath0production via the dimuon decay channel show an indication that the excited @xmath0(2s+3s ) states are not completely suppressed in au+au collisions at @xmath6 gev , and hint that the dissociation of the excited @xmath0(2s+3s ) states is less prominent at rhic than at lhc energies .",
    "there are ongoing analyses of the full 20142016 dataset of au+au collisions in both the dimuon and dielectron channels .",
    "once completed , these will provide more precise information about the extent of excited state suppression .",
    "in parallel to that , analysis of p+a data recorded in 2015 will confirm or exclude subtantial cnm effects at mid - rapidity .",
