    "the neutrino oscillations have been experimentally confirmed by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite , who observed a deficit in the flux of atmospheric neutrinos . a similar oscillation phenomenon has been long suggested to occur in solar neutrinos @xcite and have been finally confirmed by various collaborations @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the neutrino oscillations are realized if neutrinos have different masses and can be explained by mixings of three flavor neutrinos @xmath13 : the @xmath14-@xmath15 mixing for the atmospheric neutrino oscillation and the @xmath16-@xmath14 mixing for the solar neutrino oscillation .",
    "these mixings are well described by a unitary matrix @xmath0 @xcite involving three mixing angles @xmath17 , which converts three massive neutrinos @xmath18 into @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , leptonic cp violation is induced if @xmath0 contains phases , which are given by one cp - violating dirac phase @xmath19 and two cp - violating majorana phases @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the standard parameterization of @xmath0 @xcite is known to take the following form given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 represents a @xmath26-@xmath27 mixing angle ( @xmath28=1,2,3 ) .",
    "it is understood that the charged leptons and neutrinos are rotated , if necessary , to give diagonal charged - current interactions and to define the flavor neutrinos .",
    "the latest result of the experimental observation of three mixing angles is summarized as follows @xcite : @xmath29 for the normal mass hierarchy ( nh ) or for the inverted mass hierarchy ( ih ) .",
    "there are various theoretical discussions that predict these mixing angles in literatures @xcite . among others ,",
    "original bipair neutrino mixing scheme has been proposed @xcite and is based on the following constraints on @xmath0 : @xmath30 both with @xmath31 , where @xmath3 ( @xmath28=1,2,3 ) stands for the @xmath4-@xmath5 matrix element of @xmath0 .",
    "it is found that @xmath32 as well as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that the case 1 can describe nh while the case 2 can describe ih .",
    "since the observed value of @xmath8 turns out be clearly nonvanishing @xcite , there appears an interesting possibility to detect leptonic cp violation in neutrino interactions @xcite . to induce @xmath35 ,",
    "we have discussed how contributions from charged leptons modify the predictions of the bipair neutrino mixing scheme , which slightly break the required conditions , and have estimated sizes of cp - violating dirac and majorana phases @xcite .    in this letter , we explore alternative possibility to estimate effects of leptonic cp violation .",
    "we retain the constraints on @xmath0 intact even if sources of cp violation are included @xcite .",
    "since effects from cp - violating majorana phases are hidden , we expect a certain correlation of the mixing angles to cp - violating dirac phase to be clarified .",
    "cp - violating bipair neutrino mixing necessarily contains complex - valued @xmath3 .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to require the following bipair constraints in eq.([eq : org_bipair ] ) extended to include complex @xmath3 : @xmath36 when the nonvanishing @xmath8 and @xmath19 are taken into account in the requirement to obtain the cp - violating bipair neutrino mixing , eq.([eq : uupdg ] ) gives @xmath37 from @xmath38 , and @xmath39 from @xmath40 , for the case 1 .",
    "results corresponding to the case 2 are obtained by the interchange of @xmath41 simultaneously with the replacement of @xmath42 .",
    "it is readily observed that the simple sum of eqs.([eq : first ] ) and ( [ eq : second ] ) yields @xmath43 which represents a unique prediction of the cp - violating bipair neutrino mixing .",
    "the experimental data in eq.([eq : observedangle ] ) well satisfy the relations in eq.([eq : exactbipair_predictions ] ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath44 is predicted to be @xmath45 for given values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( case 1 ) or of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( case 2 ) .    for the practical purpose , we may safely omit terms proportional to @xmath50 because of the smallness of @xmath51 as in eq.([eq : observedangle ] ) .",
    "the simplest calculation can be done if @xmath52 indicating maximal cp violation is taken ; thereby , @xmath53 to be consistent with eq.([eq : observedangle ] ) and we obtain that @xmath54 where the value of @xmath7 evaluated at @xmath52 is to be denoted by @xmath55 giving @xmath56 and so on .",
    "when @xmath57 , eqs.([eq : first ] ) and ( [ eq : second ] ) indicate that corrections to @xmath55 accompany the factor @xmath58 , as a result , we find that @xmath59 where @xmath60 \\nonumber , \\\\ \\label{eq : s23-delta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the case 1 .",
    "the final expression is obtained by neglecting @xmath61 after eq.([eq : s23-delta ] ) is expanded in series of @xmath51 .",
    "the interchange of @xmath62 with the replacement of @xmath42 gives the result for the case 2 .     as a function of @xmath63 for the case 1 ( left ) or for the case 2 ( right ) .",
    "each region sandwiched by two dotted horizontal lines indicates the experimentally allowed region of @xmath64.,title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of @xmath63 for the case 1 ( left ) or for the case 2 ( right ) .",
    "each region sandwiched by two dotted horizontal lines indicates the experimentally allowed region of @xmath64.,title=\"fig : \" ]     but for @xmath65 . ]",
    "to visually see the dependence of the mixing angles on @xmath19 , we perform numerical analysis . since theoretical predictions depend on @xmath19 in the form of @xmath63 , we use @xmath63 instead of @xmath19 to draw figures .",
    "the figures fig.[fig : theta23_delta ] and [ fig : theta12_delta ] describe how @xmath66 vary with @xmath19 as a function of @xmath63 using the observed data of @xmath67 , where two different lines depend on the sign of @xmath68 in @xmath69 denoted by @xmath70 . when @xmath66 are constrained to satisfy the observed data of eq.([eq : observedangle ] ) , the range of @xmath19 can be determined to be :    * for the case 1 ( left in fig.[fig : theta23_delta ] ) , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) or @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , * for the case 2 ( right in fig.[fig : theta23_delta ] ) , @xmath75 ( @xmath72 ) or @xmath76 ( @xmath74 ) , * for the both cases ( fig.[fig : theta12_delta ] ) , @xmath77 ( @xmath72 ) or @xmath78 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "there are other ranges covered by @xmath79 giving the same value of @xmath63 . by combining the above results , we find the predicted ranges of @xmath63 :    * for the case 1 , @xmath80 ( @xmath72 ) or @xmath81 ( @xmath74 ) , * for the case 2 , @xmath77 ( @xmath72 ) or @xmath78 ( @xmath74 ) ,    it is obvious that our predictions are consistent with the observed data of @xmath19 .",
    "we have advocated that the cp - violating bipair neutrino mixing scheme well describes the observed property of neutrinos .",
    "the simplest relation among the mixing angles is found to be : @xmath9 for the case 1 or @xmath10 for the case 2 .",
    "furthermore , if dirac cp violation is observed to be maximal , @xmath64 is determined by @xmath67 to be : @xmath11 for the case 1 or @xmath12 for the case 2 .",
    "it is emphasised that the cp - violating bipair neutrino mixing predicts the experimentally favored @xmath82 for the inverted mass hierarchy to be around @xmath83 .",
    "although the cp - violating bipair neutrino mixing does not originate from any symmetry argument imposed either on the neutrino mass matrix or on the lagrangian , the predicted values of the neutrino mixing angles and the cp - violating dirac phase are well compatible with the observed data . what is the origin of the cp - violating bipair neutrino mixing scheme will remain an issue for future investigations ."
