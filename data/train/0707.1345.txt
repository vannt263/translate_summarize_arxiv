    "this relation expresses the natural condition that the star formation rate depends on the amount of gas available ; galaxies dominated by young stellar populations have large reservoirs of gas , which can be turned into stars . on the other hand ,",
    "gas - poor galaxies have consumed their gas in the past and/or have ejected it from its cold state , perhaps into the intergalactic medium , and at the present time they do not exhibit significant star formation . in dense environments , gas can also be stripped , owing to interactions with the intergalactic medium or to encounters with other systems . +",
    "a fundamental quantity related to the gas accretion history of galaxies is the gas to stellar fraction ( g / s ) .",
    "an important study of this quantity is the one of kannappan ( 2004 , hereinafter k04 ) , who determined g / s for @xmath5 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and 2mass databases on the basis of photometric techniques .",
    "a similar study on a smaller sample of low mass galaxies has been performed by geha et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereinafter g06 ) .",
    "previous important studies of the evolution of the star formation and gas content in galaxies at low and high redshift are the works by erb et al .",

    "+ by means of analytic chemical evolution models , dalcanton ( 2007 ) studied the chemical properties of local galaxies and put some quantitative constraints on their amount of gas infall and outflow .",
    "however , none of these studies was able to address how infall and outflow vary as a function of the galactic mass .",
    "+ in the present paper , we start from the sdss galaxy sample and by means of the k98 relation and other simple physical assumptions , we aim at computing how the gas accretion history of local galaxies depend on their stellar masses .",
    "the sample we are considering includes @xmath6 galaxies , larger than the one considered by k04 by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the strength of our method is that it is based on very few free parameters , whose range of values can be tested very easily , allowing us to draw robust conclusions on some fundamental physical properties of galaxies and on their evolution with cosmic time .",
    "we study how the gas mass of these galaxies has varied throughout their evolution and compare our predictions with observational data available in the literature .",
    "we focus on the present - day gas fractions and study how these quantities depend on the galactic stellar mass , investigating how the ` downsizing ' character of the galaxy populations affects their gas accretion history .",

    "following panter et al . ( 2007a ) , we select galaxies from the third data release ( dr3 ) main galaxy catalogue of the sdss . in order to remove any bias and simplify our @xmath11 criterion ( where @xmath11 is the maximum volume of the survey in which the galaxy could be observed in the sdss sample ) , we have cut our sample at @xmath12 .",

    "our effective sky coverage is @xmath19 square degrees .",
    "we also removed from our analysis a set of wavelengths which may be affected by emission lines , not modelled by the stellar population codes .",
    "+ we use the @xmath20  single stellar population models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) as the basis for this study , but we emphasize that the star formation histories allowed are very flexible .",
    "we assume an initial mass function ( imf ) given by chabrier ( 2003 ) , which is very successful at reproducing current observations in our galaxy . we chose to apply a uniform velocity dispersion of 170 kms@xmath21 to the 3  models , reflecting a typical value for the main galaxy sample .",
    "although a velocity dspersion of 170 km / s is too large to represent the smallest mass galaxies in the sample , this discrepancy does not affect any of our results .",
    "+ physical parameters of galaxies have been derived from their observed spectra by means of the moped algorithm ( heavens , jimenez & lahav 2000 ; reichardt , jimenez & heavens 2001 ) . as with previous moped studies , for this analysis",
    "we have used a single foreground dust screen .",
    "we chose to use an lmc extinction law for the main analysis as given in gordon et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .      in the past ,",
    "the sfh of galaxies was typically modelled by an exponential decay with a single parameter - for more complex models one or two bursts of formation were allowed .",
    "in fact , it would be better not to put any such constraints on star formation , particularly considering that each galaxy may have ( as a result of mergers ) several distinctly different aged populations .",
    "star formation takes place in giant molecular clouds , which have a lifetime of around @xmath22 years . splitting the history of the universe into the lifetimes of these clouds",
    "give a natural unit of time for star formation analysis , but unfortunately it would require several thousands of these units to map the age of galaxies formed 13 billion years ago , and the lack of sensitivity of the final spectrum to the detailed history would make any estimate of star formation history extremely degenerate .",
    "we choose a compromise solution , where we allow 11 time bins in which the star formation rate ( sfr ) can vary independently .",
    "this is still a difficult computational problem , but the moped ( heavens et al .",
    "2000 ) algorithm reduces processing time to approximately 1 minute per spectrum on a standard workstation .",
    "the boundaries between the 11 different bins used are determined by considering bursts of star formation at the beginning and end of each period ( at a fixed metallicity ) and set the boundaries such that the fractional difference in the final spectrum is the same for each bin .",
    "this leads to a set of timebins @xmath23 which are almost equally spaced in log(lookback time ) .",
    "nine timebins are spaced with a ratio of log(lookback time ) of 2.07 in this application of moped , plus a pair of high - redshift bins to improve resolution at @xmath24 .",
    "the central ages for the timebins @xmath23 are 0.0139 , 0.0288 , 0.0596 , 0.123 , 0.256 , 0.529 , 1.01 , 2.27 , 4.70 , 8.50 and 12.0 gyr .",
    "single - value decomposition analysis of sdss spectra , as suggested by ocvirk et al ( 2006 ) , indicates that only 2 - 5 components can be reliably recovered , not 11 , but moped in fact recovers @xmath25 significant components in 98% of cases ( tojeiro et al 2007 ) . + the gas which forms stars in each time bin is also allowed to have a metallicity which can vary independently .",
    "extensive testing ( panter et al . 2003 , panter et al . 2007 ) shows that for large samples the average star formation history is recovered with good accuracy .",
    "the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) models allow metallicities between @xmath26 . in order to investigate metallicity evolution ( panter et al . 2007 ) no regularization or other constraint",
    "is applied to the metallicity of the populations - each different age can have whatever metallicity fits best .",
    "a further complexity to the parametrization to deal with post - merger galaxies which contain gas which has followed dramatically different enrichment processes would be to have several populations with the same age but independent metallicities .",
    "it is possible to consider a more complex parametrization , but again one risks degeneracies in solution . with 11 ages , 11 metallicities and the dust parameter",
    ", the model has 23 parameters .",
    "the 23 dimensional likelihood surface is explored by a markov - chain - monte - carlo technique outlines in panter et al .",
    "further information on the moped algorithm is contained in panter ( 2005 ) .",
    "+ we take account of the 3 arcsec fibre aperture by correcting the spectrum upwards by the ratio of the @xmath27 band petrosian flux in the photometric survey to the @xmath27 band flux received by the fibre .",
    "although for individual galaxies this is likely to fail , for the population as a whole there is evidence from the colours ( glazebrook et al .",
    "2003 ) that there is no overall bias between the sampling of stellar populations by the spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "the moped algorithm allows us to determine the star formation history of each galaxy , i.e. the star formation rate values at the end of the 11 timebins described above . for each timebin , we aim at determining the cold gas mass of any galaxy on the basis of its sfr , by inverting the k98 relation , which links the gas surface density to the sfr per unit area .",
    "a similar technique was used by erb et al .",
    "( 2006a ) and erb ( 2008 ) to derive the gas fractions for a sample of star forming galaxies at @xmath28 and to study the implications of the mass - metallicity relation observed at high redshift on the galactic gas accretion history , respectively .",

    "+ at this stage , we can see how the calculated gas mass @xmath72 depends on the baryonic fraction @xmath36 .",

    "the dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath36 is then approximately @xmath77 the dependence of the resulting gas masses on @xmath36 is hence very weak , as a result of which any reasonable estimate for @xmath36 will suffice .",

    "( 2005 ) , based on the weak - lensing signals of isolated galaxies at low redshift .",
    "this is also consistent with most of the cold baryons being in stellar form .",
    "several recent cosmic baryon budget calculations ( calura & matteucci 2004 , fukugita & peebles 2004 , shankar et al .",
    "2006 ) support this hypothesis , in particular for spiral disks and spheroids .",
    "a potential difficulty of our study is that the analysis above assumes that the galaxy remains a single structure during its history , whereas the star formation history deduced from the fossil record makes no statement about where the stars were when they were formed .",
    "hence a natural question to ask is how the possible presence of merging affects these results . however , if we assume the scaling relation @xmath79 holds for any sub - units before merging , the final gas - to - star ratio is almost independent of the amount of merging which has taken place . to see this ,",
    "let us assume that at some lookback time the observed galaxy was in several pieces @xmath80 , each containing a fraction @xmath81 of the final stellar mass .",

    "the assumptions we make here are certainly challengeable , but this calculation gives us confidence that the results are likely to be robust to the merger history .",

    ", we will present how the outflow history of our galaxies evolved with cosmic and with galactic mass .",
    "+ one way to study the evolution of the gas accretion history is to analyze the evolution with mass and with cosmic time of the gas to stellar mass ratio ( g / s ) . in figure",
    "[ plotone ] , we show the evolution of g / s calculated as described in section 3 , as a function of the stellar mass for the moped galaxies at various lookback times .",
    "the dispersion of the calculated g / s is relatively small at a lookback time of 12 gyr .",
    "the dispersion however remains large ( the individual g / s span 6 orders of magnitude ) up to the preset time . at any lookback time , the average g / s ratio decreases as the stellar mass increases in the range @xmath85 .",
    "note that the highest mass bins ( @xmath86 ) are characterised by very few systems with a peculiar behaviour . in the last gyr of evolution , our predictions indicate an increase in the average",
    "g / s ratios for the galaxies with stellar masses @xmath87 , due to the fact that these galaxies must have accreted gas at late times .",
    "+ the anti - correlation between ( g / s ) and stellar mass found at any lookback time can be interpreted in the following way . in general , higher mass galaxies are more efficient at turning gas into stars , and lower mass galaxies are less efficient and so retain a large amount of their primordial gas .",

    "[ plottwo ] , where we show the evolution of ( g / s ) as a function of lookback time for several mass bins . in this figure , it is clear that the slope of the curves steepens from low mass to high mass systems , indicating decreasing gas consumption timescales from dwarf to giant galaxies .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with the downsizing picture of galaxy evolution , according to which the least massive systems formed the bulk of their stars ( consuming most of their gas reservoirs ) at recent times , whereas in the most massive galaxies the buildup of the stellar mass was complete several gyrs ago .",

    "+ to conclude this section , we compare our results for the estimated gas fractions with some individual cases of the sample studied by geha et al .",
    "+ g06 studied the gas content for a sample of low luminosity dwarf galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "this sample consits of 101 galaxies , for which they have obtained follow - up @xmath132 observations using the arecibo observatory and green bank telescope . using the measured masses of @xmath132 and the optical properties , g06 derived the @xmath132-to - stellar mass ratio @xmath133 for the galaxies of their sample .",
    "+ we have indentified 23 galaxies from our sample that are also present in the g06 sample .",
    "for this 23 galaxies , we compare our values for the stellar masses and @xmath133 to the values found by geha et al .",
    "( 2006 ) by means of a different technique .",
    "the results of this comparison are shown in table 1 .",
    "for each galaxy , we derive the quantities @xmath134 by multiplying the gas mass @xmath135 by the solar photospheric h mass fraction @xmath136 ( lodders 2003 ) .",
    "+ in some cases , the stellar mass values estimated by means of the moped algorithm differ from the values reported by g06",
    ". these differences may be due to several factors , such as the assumption of a different imf ( g06 use the imf by kroupa et al .",
    "1993 ) and uncertainties in the distances because of peculiar velocities .",
    "g06 do not present any uncertainty for their determined stellar masses . for 11 out of 24 galaxies , the discrepancies between our @xmath133 values and the ones found by g06 are within 0.7 dex , corresponding to a factor of 5 . in 10 cases ,",
    "we severely underestimate the @xmath133 and in the few remaining cases , we overestimate the results by g06 by a factor larger than 5",
    ". the very low @xmath133 we obtain in some cases may be due to underestimated galaxy dimensions or to the presence of infalling gas not taking part to star formation , as observed for the local sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( carignan et al .",
    ". however , most likely it is an indication of the fact that moped can not determine precisely the star formation history of individual galaxies but of ensambles of them , and only for large numbers the errors are very small ( see also fig .",
    "there is however another trend worth pointing out : those galaxies for which we find the best agreement in the geha sample are the ones that show strongest absorption lines , thus providing moped a better handle to recover the star formation history , while those that give the worse agreement do have only emission lines ( recall that we only model the continuum and absorption lines with moped .",

    "isolated galaxies eject gas mostly by means of galactic winds .",
    "galaxies in dense environments ( i.e. clusters and groups ) undergo gas loss via additional mechanisms , which in general are bound to environmental effects and can be of various types : tidal interactions , ram pressure stripping , viscous stripping , starvation and thermal evaporation ( see boselli & gavazzi 2006 and references therein ) . in this section , we aim at studying how the total amount of cold gas ejected by means of any mechanism evolved with cosmic time",
    ". our approach does not allow us to infer which are the main mechanisms driving gas ejection , for which more complex dynamical simulations or galactic chemical evolution models would be suited , where sn feedback is taken into account ( matteucci 1994 ; recchi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "+ to perform this task , once again we use the 11 timebins described in sect .  [ moped ] . for each galaxy",
    ", at each timebin @xmath23 we know the total baryonic mass @xmath137 .",

    "note that gas which is heated to the extent that it does not take part in star formation is counted as ejected , regardless of whether it is physically removed from the galaxy or not .",
    "we can use this information to compute the complete mass outflow histories for the galaxies of our sample .",
    "when baryons are lost or accreted , the total mass of the galaxy goes down , which puts it in a different mass bin .",
    "the current stellar mass of a galaxy depends on the star formation hostory of that galaxy , which is used here to determine the infall and ouflow history .",
    "+ in figure  [ plotseven ] , we show the computed evolution of the mean fraction of lost baryons @xmath140 , defined as @xmath141 , as a function of the stellar mass for the sdss catalogue . with one exception , these curves show a very consistent picture of progressive baryon loss over time for all but the most massive galaxies , with the lowest - mass systems losing much more baryon mass than the high - mass systems .",
    "the exception to this is the curve at a lookback time of 1.1 gyr , which is anomalous .",
    "the reason for this is almost certainly connected with the difficulty of determining the star formation rate for this population , as there is nowhere in the spectrum where the population is dominant ( mathis et al , 2006 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath140 values computed for large galaxies ( @xmath142 ) do not show a strong evolution with time , remaining at a low level of @xmath143 .",
    "combined with the g / s ratio for these systems , we conclude that early star formation is very efficient in these galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean @xmath140 values computed for galaxies in the range @xmath144 , undergo a strong evolution with lookback time , and this indicates that the galaxies of lowest mass are continually losing baryonic mass from the cold phase over a long period .",
    "this result is a confirmation of the predictions from chemical evolution models for elliptical galaxies ( matteucci 1994 ) , which showed that , in order to explain the increase of the [ mg / fe ] ratio with galactic mass , one has to assume that the efficiency of star formation is an increasing function of the galactic mass .",
    "one possibility for this is an `` inverse wind '' scenario of galaxy evolution , in which the most massive galaxies are the first ones to experience the galactic winds and to complete their outflow and star formation history , whereas the dwarf galaxies undergo substantial outflows and continuous star formation until most recent times .    as one would expect from the depths of the potential wells",
    ", we find very clear evidence that at the present day , the lower - mass galaxies have lost a larger fraction of their cold baryons , as much as 90% for galaxies with a stellar mass of @xmath145 .",
    "an analytical fit to the present day @xmath140-@xmath107 relation is @xmath146\\right\\},\\ ] ] valid for @xmath147 .",
    "an increasing trend of the ejected fractions with decreasing galactic mass is also confirmed by analytical and numerical single - burst models for dwarf galaxies ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ) .",
    "our results are in good agreement with results from galactic chemical and chemo - dynamical models considering more complex star formation histories . by means of chemo - dynamical simulations ,",
    "recchi et al . (",
    "2002 ) showed that a dwarf galaxy of baryonic mass of @xmath148 undergoing multiple starbursts can eject up to @xmath149 of its mass .",
    "chemical evolution models for elliptical galaxies of masses between @xmath150 and @xmath151 predict decreasing ejected fractions , with values between @xmath152 and 10 @xmath153 ( gibson & matteucci 1997 , pipino et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the shape and normalization of the present day @xmath140 vs @xmath107 curve derived observationally in this study is in good agreement with theoretical predictions from chemo - dynamical models where only supernova feedback has been employed .",
    "while we can not rule out that agn feedback can be also at play with the present observations , it seems that supernova feedback alone is able to displace the observed amount of cold gas from the dark halo as a function of mass .",
    "+ this study does not exclude preheating ( mo et al .",
    "2005 , crain et al .",
    "2007 ) , which prevents accretion of gas , but rather provides evidence of some process which has ejected gas from the cold phase after accretion .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ ploteight ] , we show the @xmath140 vs g / s for all the dwarf galaxies of our sample , in this case all the galaxies with @xmath154 . here , we show the behaviour of all the individial galaxies and the mean values , plotted with the error bars .",
    "[ ploteight ] shows a clear anticorrelation between the lost fraction and the present - day gas fraction .",
    "the two average values computed in the lowest g / s bins apparently show an anomalous behaviour , but these two bins contain very few systems , 8 total .",
    "the larger shaded area and the smaller dotted area indicate the regions where 100% and 85 % of the dwarf galaxies of the sample by g06 lie , respectively .",
    "[ ploteight ] shows that our results are in substantial agreement with the ones of g06 .",
    "according to geha et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the baryonic tully - fisher relation indicates that gas removal processes were not important for the majority of their sample .",
    "the geha sample includes dwarf galaxies with extremely high gas fraction , which , according to our results , must have retained the majority ( @xmath155 if we consider the @xmath156 of the geha galaxies ) of their present mass .",
    "+ our study strongly indicates that the main driver of the fraction of lost gas is the mass of the galaxy .",
    "environmental effects could also play a role in determining the fraction of gas lost from galaxies , in particular for low mass galaxies ( geha et al .",
    "however , the sdss galaxies span a large range of different environments and if the environmental effects were dominant , we should not expect such a clear correlation between lost gas and stellar mass .",
    "furthermore , recent studies ( sheth et al .",

    "2006 , mateus et al .",
    "2007 , berta et al .",
    "2008 ) of the relation between galaxy colours , luminosities and star formation histories and environment for the sdss sample have shown that such properties are more related to the mass of the host dark matter halo than to the large scale environment .",
    "the marked correlation studies in mateus et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and berta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) show that the environmental dependence is mostly driven by the mass , although other physical parameters like spin do play a secondary role .",
    "a more detailed study of lost gas fraction as a function of environment is deferred to a future paper .",
    "+ the results of this paper have been obtained self - consistently from the star formation history of the sdss galaxies , in a way which should be robust to the degree of merging which has taken place .",
    "the star formation history is linked , via the kennicutt law , to the gas mass present at any time , and hence allows us to trace the net gas accretion / outflow history .",
    "the metallicity history can be used to determine the metal outflow history , the lost metal fractions and the chemical enrichment of the inter galactic medium ; this will the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "in this paper , we used the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation , linking the surface star formation rate to the gas mass surface density , together with the scaling relations by mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) , linking the galactic scale - length radius to the baryonic mass , to recover the gas masses for @xmath6 galaxies of the sdss dr3 sample .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows .",
    "+ 1 ) we studied the time evolution of the gas to stellar mass fractions for all the galaxies of the sdss catalogue . in the last gyr of evolution ,",
    "our predictions indicate an increase in the average ( g / s ) for the galaxies with stellar masses @xmath87 , in agreement with the the downsizing picture of galaxy evolution , where the most massive galaxies form the bulk of their stars at early times . at the present time , we predict individual @xmath88 values between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these lower and upper limits are in agreement with independent estimates of the ( g / s ) in the local gas poorest and richest galaxies , respectively .",
    "+ 2 ) we split the galaxy sample into a red and a blue population by means of two different criteria , i.e. the recent amount of star formation and the colour excess @xmath129 .",
    "the ( g / s ) calculated by adopting the first criterion are in good agreement with independent estimates based on photometric techniques ( kannappan 2004 ) , in particular for the galaxies with stellar masses @xmath128 .",
    "the adoption of the colour excess criterion implies instead a less clear distinction between the two galactic populations .",
    "+ 3 ) we computed the time evolution of the average fraction of lost baryons @xmath140 , defined as @xmath141 as a function of the stellar mass for the sdss catalogue . with the exception of an anomaly at a lookback time of 1gyr ( which we put down to the difficulty of determining star formation rates at this time ; mathis et al 2006 ) ,",
    "the results show clear signatures that the fraction of lost cold baryons increases with time for all but the highest - mass galaxies , and that the fraction lost is heavily dependent on the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "the lost fraction varies between about 10 - 20% for @xmath157 , to @xmath158 for low - mass ( @xmath159 ) galaxies .",
    "the significant loss of gas from the low - mass systems is not surprising given the small potential wells involved , and may be responsible for the lack of observed low - mass galaxy satellites compared with simulations ( klypin et al 1999 , moore et al 1999 ) , even including the latest dwarfs detected in sdss ( e.g. belokurov et al 2007 ) .",
    "our results are in agreement with chemical evolution models for elliptical galaxies ( matteucci 1994 ) , and could be explained by an `` inverse wind '' scenario for galaxy evolution , i.e. that the most massive systems are the first ones to undergo mass loss via galactic winds . in any event",
    "our results show clearly the `` downsizing '' character of the galaxy population , with the star formation in high - mass galaxies essentially complete at early times .",
