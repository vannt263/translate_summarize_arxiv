    "one of the fundamental parameters of any explosive phenomenon is the overall energy release . in the specific case of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , it is essential to measure the energy of both the prompt @xmath0-ray phase ( @xmath19 ) and the blast wave which powers the afterglow ( @xmath20 ) , since these two quantities define the total relativistic output of the central engine ( @xmath21 ) and the efficiency of energy dissipation in the form of @xmath0-rays ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "while the isotropic - equivalent prompt energy is easily derived from the observed fluence ( @xmath23 ) and distance ( @xmath24 ) of the burst , a measurement of @xmath20 is more challenging because it requires observations of the afterglow over a broad range in time and frequency ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "luckily , the afterglow flux at frequencies above the synchrotron cooling frequency , @xmath25 , provides a robust proxy for @xmath20 since it is independent of the circumburst density and depends only weakly on the fraction of shock energy in magnetic fields , @xmath26 @xcite . for typical parameters @xcite ,",
    "the soft x - ray band lies above @xmath25 , and therefore the x - ray luminosity , @xmath27 ; here @xmath28 is the fraction of shock energy in relativistic electrons .    in the case of the long - duration grbs ( @xmath29 s ) ,",
    "extensive studies of the relativistic energy output based on these various techniques suggest that for most bursts @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and most importantly their sum , span less than an order of magnitude around @xmath30 erg _ when corrected for jet collimation of the ejecta _",
    "recent observations of low redshift long grbs paint a more complicated picture in which a population of sub - energetic bursts ( @xmath31 erg ) likely dominates the overall grb rate @xcite .",
    "still , the conclusion that the energy release of long grbs is in the range typical of supernovae , and that they are collimated with opening angles of @xmath32 , has placed valuable constraints on the progenitor and engine models .",
    "the discovery of afterglow emission from short - duration grbs less than 2 years ago makes it now possible to carry out a similar analysis of their total energy output .",
    "early observations indicated a lower isotropic - equivalent energy release compared to long grbs , @xmath33 erg , in both the prompt and afterglow phase @xcite , as well as wider jet opening angles @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite noted based on a small sample of six bursts that the ratio of afterglow x - ray flux and @xmath0-ray fluence , @xmath34 , appears to have a bimodal distribution with values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "they argue that the latter bursts require a low circumburst density , @xmath37 @xmath10 , likely due to ejection of the progenitor system from its host galaxy into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the recent association of several short grbs with faint galaxies , of which several have been spectroscopically confirmed to be at @xmath38 , indicates a wide redshift distribution , and hence a wider range of energies than previously proposed @xcite .",
    "here , i take advantage of these new observations to study the prompt and afterglow energies of the complete sample of 17 short bursts with prompt x - ray follow - up , a much larger sample than previously investigated . of these 17 bursts ,",
    "eight have measured redshifts , and an additional five have approximate or constrained redshifts .",
    "using the @xmath0-ray fluences and x - ray fluxes normalized to 1 day after the burst i show that @xmath4 and @xmath39 span at least three orders of magnitude ( possibly up to @xmath40 erg ) .",
    "more importantly , i establish that @xmath1 of the bursts exhibit a tight correlation between their prompt and afterglow energy output , suggesting a narrow distribution of @xmath41 , while @xmath6 indeed have ratios of @xmath42 that are suppressed by three orders of magnitude .",
    "these results place important constraints on the progenitor and energy extraction models , as well as the properties of the circumburst medium and the shock microphysical parameters .",
    "the @xmath0-ray and x - ray afterglow properties of the 17 short bursts with prompt x - ray follow - up are listed in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "i also list the available measurements or constraints on the redshift from host galaxy and afterglow observations .",
    "the relevant references are provided in the table .",
    "for grb061210 the x - ray fluxes have not been published and i therefore obtained the xrt data from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center .",
    "i processed the data with the xrtpipeline script packaged within the heasoft software , using the default grade selection and screening parameters to produce a light curve for the @xmath43 kev energy range . using a galactic neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath44 @xmath45 , and a typical @xmath46 , i find a conversion rate of 1 count s@xmath47 erg @xmath45 s@xmath14 .",
    "in addition , inspection of the x - ray light curve of grb061006 @xcite reveals a possible steepening at @xmath48 s. to investigate this possibility i obtained the xrt data from heasarc and followed the same analysis procedure as for grb061210 .",
    "i find a likely steepening using data that were obtained @xmath49 days after the burst , with a flux decay rate , @xmath50 .",
    "in the analysis below i use the standard cosmological parameters : @xmath51 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fxfgamma ] , i plot the histograms of @xmath23 and @xmath54 , the x - ray flux normalized to @xmath2 d after the burst .",
    "i use the observed values of @xmath55 when available , or the median value , @xmath56 , when the decay rate is not known .",
    "the majority of the bursts span about two orders of magnitude around @xmath57 erg @xmath45 @xmath58 , similar to the width of the distribution for long grbs @xcite .",
    "however , there is a noticeable tail extending to fainter fluxes , which leads to an overall spread of about five orders of magnitude and a median flux of @xmath59 erg @xmath45 s@xmath14 .",
    "the fluence distribution is narrower , with an overall width of about 2.7 orders of magnitude around a median value of @xmath60 erg cm@xmath14 .",
    "the median values of both @xmath23 and @xmath54 are about a factor of five smaller than for  long grbs @xcite .",
    "more interesting is the apparent correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath54 for the majority of the bursts ( figure  [ fig : fxfgamma ] ) .",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is @xmath62 , indicating a null hypothesis ( no correlation ) probability of only @xmath63 . fitting the data",
    ", i find that the best - fit relation is linear , @xmath64 erg @xmath45 s@xmath14 with a scatter of about @xmath65 dex based on a fit to 13 of the 17 bursts that follow the trend .",
    "the tight linear correlation suggests that @xmath41 has a narrow distribution , and that in most bursts the x - ray band indeed lies above the cooling frequency and traces @xmath20 .",
    "based on the observed correlation i infer that @xmath66 ( see also @xcite ) . for a typical @xmath67 ,",
    "the fraction of energy emitted in @xmath0-rays is thus @xmath68 , with an overall range of about @xmath69 , similar to the values inferred for long grbs @xcite .",
    "an even tighter correlation is evident between the x - ray luminosity , @xmath70 , and @xmath4 ; figure",
    "[ fig : egammalx ] .",
    "the isotropic x - ray luminosity is given by : @xmath71 where for @xmath8 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the power law index of the electron distribution , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the isotropic @xmath0-ray energy ( neglecting redshift - dependent bolometric corrections ) is given by : @xmath76    to assess @xmath5 and @xmath4 i use the redshifts measured for eight bursts from their host galaxies , as well as approximate redshifts for three bursts ( 050813 , 060121 , and 061201 ) and limits for an additional two ( 051210 and 060313 ) .",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is @xmath77 , ( null hypothesis probability of only @xmath78 ) .",
    "the correlation appears to be slightly non - linear , @xmath79 , primarily because for @xmath80 the dependence on @xmath81 does not cancel out when taking the ratio of equations  [ eqn : lx ] and [ eqn : egamma ] . as can be seen from table  [ tab : data ] , the bolometric correction factors to @xmath4 are in the range of @xmath82 when converting from the @xmath83 kev band to the @xmath84 kev band .",
    "these upward corrections to @xmath85 will tend to linearize the correlation .",
    "in addition to the overall strong correlation , it is also clear from figure  [ fig : egammalx ] that the range of inferred energies spans @xmath86 erg ( @xmath83 kev ) , and may exceed @xmath40 erg if some of the bursts with unknown redshifts are located at @xmath87 , as suggested by their faint host galaxies ( @xmath88 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "the full range of @xmath49 orders of magnitude is similar to the spread in @xmath4 observed for long grbs @xcite .",
    "the data presented in this paper conclusively show that the majority ( @xmath1 ) of all short grbs exhibit a tight correlation between their isotropic - equivalent prompt @xmath0-ray and blast wave kinetic energies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred @xmath0-ray efficiency is @xmath89 with a narrow spread of about @xmath90 dex .",
    "this result is indeed verified by the three bursts for which detailed afterglow observations are available , with derived @xmath41 values of 0.8 ( grb050709 ; @xcite ) , 0.2 ( grb050724 ; @xcite ) , and 0.65 ( grb051221a ; @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath6 of short bursts have x - ray fluxes that are suppressed by about three orders of magnitude compared to their @xmath0-ray fluence .",
    "i stress that if this is indeed due to a low circumburst density (  [ sec : outliers ] ) , which leads to @xmath91 , then observations of the afterglow at higher x - ray energies ( above @xmath92 ) should recover the same narrow distribution of @xmath41 seen for the bulk of the population .",
    "the observed correlation and the inferred narrow distribution of @xmath41 have several crucial implications for short grb progenitor models , the energy extraction mechanism , and burst properties such as the circumburst density and shock microphysics .",
    "the overall narrow spread in @xmath41 , and the median value , are similar to those observed in long grbs @xcite , suggesting that the properties of the relativistic outflow are similar for long and short bursts and are generally independent of the identity of the progenitor or the circumburst environment .",
    "in addition , the tight correlation between @xmath0-ray and afterglow energies indicates that for most bursts the underlying assumption that @xmath8 is indeed correct . therefore the required circumburst densities are @xcite @xmath93 @xmath10 , typical of interstellar environments . in the context of binary compact object progenitors ( ns - ns , ns - bh ) ,",
    "the inferred densities indicate that the majority of the progenitors do not experience kick velocities that are large enough for ejection into the intergalactic medium and/or that the merger timescales are short enough that the distance traveled is @xmath94 kpc .",
    "finally , the fraction of energy in relativistic electrons , @xmath95 , must also have a narrow distribution , since both @xmath41 and @xmath96 have a narrow spread .",
    "while there is a clear correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath39 , the overall spread in isotropic - equivalent energies appears to be wider than for the beaming - corrected energies of long grbs , _ unless the outflows of short grbs with the highest energies are strongly collimated_. to date , only grb051221a exhibits evidence for significant beaming , with @xmath97\\approx 7.5\\times 10^{-3}$ ] @xcite , while grb050709 appears to have a wide jet with @xmath98 @xcite . in general short grb jets",
    "appear to be wider than those of long grbs with @xmath99 compared to @xmath100 @xcite .    in the larger sample presented here two additional bursts with known redshifts ( 061006 and 061210 ) exhibit",
    "steep decays , @xmath101 , at late time , reminiscent of a post jet break evolution ( for which the expected value is @xmath102 with @xmath103 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to grb051221a these bursts also have the largest secure values of @xmath4 . in the case of grb061006",
    "there is a clear break at @xmath104 s , while for grb061210 the light curve is already in the rapid decay phase at the time of the first observations , @xmath105 s. using the conversion from jet break time to opening angle @xcite : @xmath106 i find @xmath107 for grb061006 and @xmath108 for grb061210 ( @xmath109 @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , in the context of jet breaks , the beaming - corrected energies are @xmath110 erg and @xmath111 erg , respectively .",
    "these values are within a factor of few of @xmath112 erg inferred for grb051221a @xcite , and @xmath113 inferred for for grb050709 @xcite .    if the observed steep decays are indeed due to jets , this leads to a similar inverse correlation between @xmath114 and beaming correction that is observed in long grbs @xcite , and thus to a narrow distribution of @xmath115 erg .",
    "models of the relativistic outflows from black hole accretion systems relevant for short grbs indicate @xmath116 with opening angles of @xmath117 @xcite , in good agreement with the observations presented here .",
    "it is thus possible that short grbs also exhibit a nearly standard energy release , with an overall scale that is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of long grbs .",
    "the proposed beaming corrections also impact the nature of the energy extraction mechanism .",
    "in particular , extraction via @xmath118 annihilation has been argued to provide at most @xmath119 erg @xcite , which may be sufficient if the beaming corrections are valid . on the other hand ,",
    "if the observed steep decays are not due to jets , then the required large energies likely point to mhd processes such as the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite , which can produce luminosities in excess of @xmath120 erg s@xmath121 .",
    "these possibilities have to be assessed with a larger sample of bursts , with particular attention to multi - wavelength observations that can differentiate between bona - fide jet breaks and other scenarios ( e.g. , energy or density variations ) .",
    "i further investigate whether there is a correlation between the energy release and burst duration ( @xmath122 ) ; figure  [ fig : fxfgamma ] . for the full sample",
    "i find a spearman s rank correlation coefficient , @xmath123 , or a null hypothesis probability of only @xmath124 .",
    "removing grb050509b , which has the shortest duration and smallest fluence , i find @xmath125 , or a probability of @xmath126 that the null hypothesis is satisfied .",
    "thus , i conclude that with the present sample the correlation between fluence and duration is suggestive , though not conclusive .",
    "a more physically meaningful test is whether @xmath4 is correlated with the rest - frame duration , @xmath127 . in this case",
    ", i find that for the eight bursts with secure redshifts the null hypothesis has a probability of @xmath128 , so an overall correlation does not appear to be statistically meaningful . curiously , the sample of six bursts with secure redshifts and late - type host galaxies has @xmath77 ( null hypothesis probability of only @xmath129 ) , but this result is likely due to small number statistics . to conclude , there is some tentative evidence for a positive correlation between energy release and duration , but this will have to be re - assessed with a larger sample .",
    "similarly , i check for a relation between energy release and host galaxy type .",
    "this is the case for type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , which tend to have lower luminosities in early - type galaxies than in late - type galaxies , likely due to a dependence on the progenitor ages @xcite .",
    "short grbs also occur in both types of galaxies so a similar trend may shed light on the progenitor properties . in the sample presented here ,",
    "three bursts have been localized to early - type galaxies ( 050509b , 050724 , and 050813 ) , while six have secure late - type hosts ( 050709 , 051221a , 060801 , 061006 , 061210 , and 061217 ) .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab : data ] both groups appear to span the full range of @xmath0-ray energies and x - ray luminosities , suggesting no clear correlation with host galaxy type for the present sample .",
    "finally , i return to the @xmath6 of outliers with an unusually low ratio of @xmath7 .",
    "the possible nature of these objects has been discussed by @xcite who noted several possibilities for the suppressed x - ray flux , in particular a low circumburst density ( @xmath37 @xmath10 ) , typical of the intergalactic medium .",
    "this is argued to support the idea of large kick velocities , @xmath130 km s@xmath14 , for some progenitors .",
    "here i simply note that while all four outliers have fluences at the low end of the distribution , @xmath131 erg @xmath45 ( figure  [ fig : fxfgamma ] ) , the two with redshift constraints ( 050813 and 051210 ) appear to reside at @xmath132 and therefore their energies are at the high end of the overall distribution .",
    "no other parameters clearly distinguish the outliers from the bulk of the population that has a narrow distribution of @xmath41 , suggesting that indeed an extrinsic parameter such as the density is responsible for their low x - ray fluxes .    in the context of a low density interpretation for these outliers , and given the clearly bimodal distribution , i propose the following intriguing possibility .",
    "the observed fraction of 20% is similar to predictions of the fraction of short grbs that may arise from dynamically - formed neutron star binaries in globular clusters ( @xmath133 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario may naturally explain the required low densities since the intra - cluster medium of globular clusters has a typical limit of @xmath134 @xmath10 @xcite , likely as a result of gas stripping from frequent passages through the galactic disk .",
    "this scenario also naturally explains the bimodal distribution of @xmath13 ( and hence densities ) , since the bursts occur in either interstellar environments with @xmath9 @xmath10 (  [ sec : epsilon ] ) or in the low density environments of globular clusters .",
    "thus , this alternative scenario removes the need for speculative large kick velocities for the outliers @xcite , which in any case predicts a more uniform distribution of densities and hence @xmath13 than currently observed .",
    "based on prompt @xmath0-ray and x - ray afterglow observations of a sample of 17 short grbs with rapid xrt follow - up i find the following results :    1 .",
    "the majority of short grbs ( 80% ) follow a linear correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which indicates a narrow distribution of @xmath0-ray efficiency ( 0.14 dex ) with @xmath135 , similar to the values for long grbs .",
    "the observed correlation also indicates that generally @xmath136 and therefore @xmath9 @xmath10 , indicative of interstellar explosion sites .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent energies span @xmath12 erg , similar in width to the distribution for long grbs , but lower by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "4 .   possible beaming corrections for several short bursts with the highest values of @xmath4 may point to an inverse correlation such that the true energy release has a narrow distribution of @xmath137 . 5 .   there is a possible weak correlation between @xmath138 and burst duration ; no clear relation is evident between energy release and host galaxy type .",
    "a small fraction of outliers ( 20% ) , with @xmath13 lower by three orders of magnitude , are likely the result of low circumburst densities .",
    "the low density , strong bimodality of the distribution , and similarity in predicted rates , are naturally explained in a globular cluster origin as opposed to large kick velocities .    with these properties of short grbs",
    "well - established the next step is to assess the importance of beaming corrections , and hence the true distribution of total relativistic output from the central engine .",
