    "<S> in quantum theory the vacuum is defined as a state of minimum energy that is devoid of particles but still not completely empty . </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps more surprising that its definition depends on the geometry of the system and on the trajectory of an observer through space - time . along these lines </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the case of an atom flying at constant velocity near a planar surface . </S>",
    "<S> using general concepts of statistical mechanics it is shown that the motion - modified interaction with the electromagnetic vacuum is formally equivalent to the interaction with a thermal field having an effective temperature determined by the atom s velocity and distance from the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests new ways to experimentally investigate the properties of the quantum vacuum in non - equilibrium systems and effects such as quantum friction .    </S>",
    "<S> the advent of the quantum theory has deeply changed our idea of empty space by obliging us to reformulate our notion of the vacuum from a state of nothingness to a state roiling with fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this has led to new fundamental questions but also to new interesting predictions such as the casimir effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , effects related to the properties of vacuum are no longer theoretical curiosities and have attracted growing attention from the experimental community for their multiple implications in science @xcite and technologies @xcite . in the 1970s another unexpected twist occurred . in their seminal papers , fulling , davies and unruh @xcite predicted that a detector moving through the quantum vacuum with uniform acceleration @xmath0 effectively `` feels '' the surrounding field as if it were in a state of thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath1 here @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denote , respectively , the planck constant , the boltzmann constant , and the speed of light in vacuum . this expression , sometimes called the hawking - unruh temperature , is connected to another seminal contribution from hawking , who , a few years before , by mixing quantum electrodynamics and general relativity , demonstrated that thermal photons are created by the black hole s gravitational field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their temperature is formally identical to , where , however , the acceleration is in this case replaced by the surface gravity of the black hole . while the casimir effect has highlighted the reliance of vacuum on geometrical boundary conditions @xcite , the fulling - davies - unruh ( fdu ) effect has played a crucial role in our understanding of quantum field theory by showing that the quantum vacuum also depends on the reference frame of the observer @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> acceleration is an essential ingredient for the fdu effect . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the covariant form of quantum field theory implies that a motion through vacuum with uniform velocity is physically equivalent to the stationary case ( lorentz invariance ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , despite quantum fluctuations , an object moving in empty space at constant velocity will preserve its motion undisturbed . </S>",

    "<S> quantum friction is associated with the emission and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the medium at a velocity different from the speed of light in vacuum and the physics behind it shows connections with the vavilov - cherenkov effect @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> one can show that , even in this limit , an effective temperature can still be defined as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> where , however , the replacement @xmath98 $ ] has to be made @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is directly associated with the vavilov - cherenkov radiation and it shows that the temperature is nonzero only when the corresponding velocity threshold , @xmath99 , is met @xcite ( for @xmath100 non - relativistic velocities can still be considered ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main impact of realistic material properties is therefore to affect the threshold imposed by the speed of light in the medium , allowing for it to be zero .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to stress the role of non - equilibrium physics in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the fdt - like expression in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> reveals two major modifications relative to equilibrium physics , both of which are connected to the motion of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the appearance of doppler - shifted frequencies which , in turn , leads to the occurrence of the anomalous doppler effect and to the excitation of the atom s internal degrees of freedom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , eq .   is not simply a doppler - shifted version of eq . and </S>",
    "<S> the additional modification induced by non - equilibrium physics plays an essential role into the appearance of the effective temperature ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , since the physical process that `` heats '' the atom is the same that leads to quantum friction , measuring the former leads to an indirect investigation of the latter . for an atom moving at a velocity of 340 m </S>",
    "<S> / s at a distance of 10 nm from the surface , the effective temperature @xmath10 is about 130 mk , which in frequency units corresponds to @xmath101 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , measurements of the internal state population in systems involving , for example , beams of atoms @xcite , molecules @xcite or even defect - centres in nano - diamonds @xcite can be suitable candidates for the experimental investigation of the previous predictions .    </S>",
