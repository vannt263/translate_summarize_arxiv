    ". therefore , it is classical to prove that the following three minimization problems are equivalent ( in the sense that any solution of one gives a solution of the others after a suitable scaling ) :    ( i ) : :    @xmath20 ( ii ) : :    @xmath21 ( iii ) : :    @xmath22    let us make some comments .",
    "for a detailed bibliography on closed elasticae , we refer to the classical @xcite or the more recent @xcite .",

    "if we take as a domain @xmath6 the ring @xmath25 we get @xmath26 , while @xmath27 showing that @xmath28 when @xmath29 .    in the same way , the boundedness assumption is also necessary .",
    "let us consider the following unbounded domain , subgraph of a gaussian function , but with finite area and elastic energy : @xmath30 we have @xmath31 while @xmath32 and we see that @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "this shows that the assumptions in theorem [ bhe05 ] can not be weakened .",
    "the proof of theorem [ bhe05 ] is a classical variational proof ( existence , regularity , analysis of the optimality conditions ) , but the existence part is by no means easy since we need a control on the perimeter of a minimizing sequence . the boundedness constraints on @xmath35 and @xmath11 do not ensure that the perimeter is uniformly bounded , as shown by a counter - example like a dumbell , see figure [ dumbell ] .",
    "one has to be particularly careful that a minimizing sequence may a priori have a diameter going to infinity .",
    "the key point of our strategy is to analyze first the minimization of the elastic energy of drops enclosing a fixed area , i.e. closed loops without self - intersection points , which are smooth except one point , where the tangents are opposite .",
    "the result for drops will straight forward imply the conclusion of theorem [ bhe05 ] , since we prove that the optimal loop is smooth and satisfies optimality conditions over the full boundary .",

    "this is a key point for proving existence . * in order to be able to exploit the optimality conditions we have to deal with self - intersection points and with the points where the optimal set is touching the boundary of the ball @xmath39 .",
    "for this reason , we analyze the problem @xmath43 we refer to section [ drops ] for a precise definition of drops .",
    "we prove that an optimal drop does not have self - intersection points and , if @xmath41 is large enough , it does not touch the boundary of the ball @xmath39 ( up to a translation , inside the ball ) .",
    "henceforth , optimality conditions allow us to exhibit precisely the optimal drop and to evaluate its energy .",
    "this drop turns out to be _ unique_.",
    "* we come back to problem and prove that a limit of minimizing sequence can not have self - intersection points and can not touch the boundary of @xmath39 , provided that @xmath41 is large enough .",
    "consequently , optimality conditions can be written on all its boundary .",
    "the elimination of self - intersection points relies on the previous result on drops , since the presence of at least one such point would make the energy not smaller than the double of the energy of the optimal drop , which turns out to be larger than the energy of a disc of radius @xmath44 .",

    "this one is fully characterized by the optimality conditions ( b1)-(b2 ) with a unique constant @xmath71 which can be determined .",
    "+ moreover @xmath312.\\ ] ]    figure [ the optimal drop ] gives the representation of the optimal drop .",
    "the proof of existence follows from theorem [ bh03 ] and lemma [ bhe02 ] .",
    "the optimality conditions ( b1)-(b4 ) can be written on the whole @xmath0 ( except at the singularity ) according to theorem [ opti ] .",
    "we start for @xmath313 at the origin which is the singular point with an horizontal tangent ( @xmath314 ) . by ( b4 ) and starshaped property , the point @xmath103 is necessarily on the @xmath315-axis , the curvature @xmath2 is negative for @xmath316 small and @xmath317 when @xmath318 .",
    "the function @xmath2 is periodic but we will prove below ( see the end of the proof ) that we have only one period for the optimal drop and the curve is symmetric around the @xmath315-axis .",
    "therefore to characterize the optimal drop , we can proceed in the following way : for any constant @xmath183 , we solve the ode @xmath319 which has a unique solution .",
    "let us denote by @xmath320 the value where @xmath10 is maximum with @xmath321 ( respectively @xmath322 and @xmath323 for the minimum ) .",
    "the point @xmath104 of abscissa @xmath320 is necessarily on the @xmath315-axis and its tangent is vertical .",
    "thus , we look for the value of @xmath71 for which @xmath324 .    we claim that conversely , if we find a value of @xmath71 for which @xmath325 , then we have found the optimal drop . indeed , since it satisfies the optimality conditions , it suffices to check that the curve we obtain by @xmath326 and @xmath327 with @xmath328 is an admissible drop . since @xmath104 is the point where the curvature is maximum , according to ( b3 ) , it is the point on @xmath0 which is the farthest to @xmath103 .",
    "but since the tangent is vertical at this point it is necessarily on the @xmath315-axis : @xmath329 and the total length of the curve is @xmath330 .",
    "now , since @xmath10 is symmetric with respect to @xmath320 ( see ( ode1 ) in the appendix ) , @xmath331 which provides after integration : @xmath332 .",
    "this identity gives @xmath333 and @xmath334 which shows that the curve @xmath0 is a drop .",
    "thus to prove uniqueness of the optimal drop , we need to prove that we can find only one @xmath183 for which @xmath335 .",
    "let us write @xmath336 where we used the symmetry of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath322 , see ( ode1 ) .",
    "this symmetry also shows that @xmath337 .",
    "we are going to prove uniqueness of @xmath71 ( and therefore of the optimal drop ) by proving that the function @xmath338 is strictly decreasing .",
    "let us perform the change of variable @xmath339 in each above integral .",
    "it comes , using ( b2 ) to express @xmath115 : @xmath340 now to compute the derivative of the first integral @xmath341 with respect to @xmath71 , we make the change of variable @xmath342 , it comes @xmath343 we compute the derivative of @xmath344 using @xmath345 ( see ( ode3 ) in the appendix ) and an easy computation gives @xmath346 which is clearly negative . in the same way , we get for the second integral @xmath347 : @xmath348 which is also negative , proving the uniqueness of a solution @xmath71 for the equation @xmath349 .",
    "let us remark that a simple computation yields @xmath350 while the limit of @xmath351 when @xmath71 goes to @xmath352 is @xmath353 confirming that there exists a solution to our problem .",
    "let us estimate from below the energy of the optimal drop .",
    "denote by @xmath354 the first positive zero of @xmath10 , we recall that @xmath322 is the first minimum of @xmath10 and @xmath355 , @xmath320 the first maximum of @xmath10 and @xmath356 . from ( b2 ) @xmath357 and @xmath358 are the real roots of the polynomial ( which is concave ) @xmath359 the maximum of @xmath360 is at @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "we have @xmath363 ( @xmath357 can not be nonnegative , otherwise the set @xmath305 would be convex ) .    moreover ,",
    "when @xmath71 increases , @xmath364 is increasing while @xmath365 is decreasing ( with increasing absolute value @xmath366 ) , because we translate the curve @xmath367 up ) .",
    "if we denote @xmath368 and @xmath369 the sum and the product of those two roots , classical elimination and relation between roots provide @xmath370 while the two complex roots @xmath371 satisfy @xmath372 , @xmath373 .    since @xmath374 and @xmath183",
    ", the last equation gives @xmath375 .",
    "let us come back to the computation of the elastic energy of the optimal drop @xmath301 @xmath376 now @xmath377 and @xmath10 is increasing from @xmath322 to @xmath320 ( since @xmath115 can only vanish at zeroes of @xmath378 , which only correspond to maxima @xmath358 and minima @xmath357 ) .",
    "we perform the change of variable @xmath379 on this interval @xmath380 .",
    "therefore @xmath381 we want to find a lower bound of this integral . for this purpose , we write ( following ) @xmath382 now , the parabola @xmath383 is symmetric with respect to @xmath384 , an since @xmath385 , the maximum of @xmath386 on the interval @xmath387 $ ] is equal to @xmath388 where we have used for the last equality",
    ". thus @xmath389 this last integral can be computed explicitly and gives @xmath390 we have @xmath391 and gives @xmath392 it remains to get a bound for the quantity @xmath393 which depends only on @xmath71 .",
    "we discuss two cases .    * case a. * if @xmath394 , @xmath395 . both mappings",
    "@xmath396 , @xmath397 are increasing , thus @xmath398 .",
    "we study @xmath399 @xmath400 we get @xmath401 while from @xmath402 and @xmath403 , we get @xmath404 it follows that @xmath405    * case b. * in the case @xmath406 , we use @xmath407 , @xmath408 and @xmath409 to get @xmath410 so in any case , @xmath411 .",
    "it follows from that @xmath412 now , integrating ( b4 ) on the curve , we get @xmath413 .",
    "therefore @xmath414 let us now conclude by proving that the optimal drop has only one period of the function @xmath2 .",
    "the estimate ( [ bhe16 ] ) we get is actually true on any possible period .",
    "therefore , if we have a solution @xmath415 with at least two periods , we would have @xmath416 , therefore like in ( [ bhe17 ] ) its total energy would satisfy @xmath417 . now , proceeding in a similar way as we did for the estimate from below , we can get ( details omitted ) an estimate from above for an optimal drop with only one period which is @xmath418 ( the exact value is @xmath419 ) therefore , any critical point with more than one period can not be optimal .",
    "with the notation settled in sections [ prel ] and [ drops ] we return to problem , and write @xmath420    first of all we recall that among all circles , the optimal one has the radius @xmath421 .",
    "let us consider @xmath422 and solve the problem @xmath423 using the same arguments as in section [ drops ] , a minimizing sequence will converge to a couple @xmath424 .",
    "two possibilities occur .",
    "assume first that there are self intersections .",
    "in this case the limiting couple @xmath424 contains at least two drops , as in case 3 of theorem [ bh03 ] . following theorem [ bhe01 ]",
    ", this configuration can not be optimal since the energy of @xmath6 is larger than the double of the optimal energy of a drop , so it is excluded .",
    "the second situation is that @xmath424 does not have self - intersections . since the radius is large enough , for a suitable translation the loop does not touch the boundary of the ball , as in lemma [ bhe02 ] .",
    "moreover , in this case the optimality conditions @xmath425 can be written on the full boundary .",
    "this condition recalls the result of ben andrews ( see theorem 1.5 in @xcite ) which , under the hypothesis of positive curvature would allow directly to conclude that the curve is a circle with a radius equal to @xmath426 ( by direct computation ) .",
    "as the curvature is not known to be positive , for our conclusion we shall use again the optimality conditions .",
    "actually , andrews s result does not hold true for non convex curves .",
    "indeed , figure [ 23fig ] ( which has been obtained using the optimality conditions ) shows a curve which satisfies @xmath425 on the whole boundary .",
    "if the curvature is not constant , we can assert that @xmath6 is star shaped and the structure of @xmath0 is a union of periods consisting of two branches @xmath427 and @xmath428 , where @xmath429{\\rightarrow}{{\\mathbb r}}^2 $ ] is a branch of the curve with increasing curvature such that @xmath430 and @xmath431{\\rightarrow}{{\\mathbb r}}^2 $ ] is a congruent branch with decreasing curvature from @xmath358 to @xmath357 . following and ( ode4 ) , @xmath0 consists of one , two or three periods @xmath432 ( as explained in the proof of theorem [ bhe01 ] . from the optimality conditions",
    "@xmath433 one can eliminate any of those three configurations , since their energy is much larger than the one of the ball .",
    "indeed , in the case of two or three periods , a couple @xmath432 has a cap @xmath434 , where @xmath435 is chosen such that @xmath436 is orthogonal to the segment @xmath437 . as on figure",
    "[ 23fig ] , we can cut and reflect along the line @xmath438 to get a new domain which smaller area and smaller elastic energy .",
    "if there is only one period , the argument is similar since we can center - symmetrize the branch from @xmath439 to @xmath440 , where @xmath435 is chosen such that the normal at @xmath439 is parallel to the segment @xmath437 ( see figure [ 1fig ] ) .",
    "both previous constructions are admissible as a consequence of the optimality conditions @xmath433 .",
    "in this section , we give several properties of the following ode in nonstandard form @xmath441 where @xmath442 is a constant .",
    "this ode is issued from the optimality conditions on a free branch of a minimizer for our problem , see theorem [ opti ] .",
    "we also refer the reader to reference @xcite for related analysis .        1 .",
    "the solution of the ode is periodic ( the period is denoted by @xmath117 ) , symmetric with respect to its minimum or maximum .",
    "[ ode2 ] the only local minima ( maxima ) are actually global minima ( maxima , respectively ) and correspond to @xmath447 ( @xmath448 , respectively ) , and @xmath10 is monotone between these two values .",
    "[ ode3 ] the mapping @xmath449 is increasing and its range is from @xmath450 to @xmath352 , while the mapping @xmath451 is decreasing and its range is from @xmath452 to @xmath450 .",
