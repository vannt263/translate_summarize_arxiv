    "there is controversy in the literature about the existence of a bimodality in the distribution of radio - to - optical flux ratio , @xmath0 , for quasars ( the so - called quasar radio dichotomy ) .",
    "for example , white _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) suggested that previous detections of radio dichotomy were caused by selection effects . on the other hand , ivezi et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter i02 ) claimed that a sample of quasars detected by the sdss and first surveys supports the existence of a radio dichotomy .",
    "the latter result was recently questioned on statistical grounds by cirasuolo et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter c03 ) .",
    "i02 determined the distribution of @xmath3 for narrow regions in the @xmath4 ( radio ab magnitude ) vs. @xmath5 ( optical magnitude ) plane that were oriented perpendicular to the @xmath6=const .",
    "lines ( see top left panel in figure 1 ) .",
    "in other words , the quasar density in the @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 plane , @xmath7 , was found to be a separable function @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution , @xmath9 , determined this way has a strong maximum at @xmath10 , and declines towards smaller @xmath6 ( bottom left panel in fig .",
    "1 ) . since a large majority ( @xmath11 ) of quasars undetected by first form another peak at @xmath12 ,",
    "the local minimum at @xmath13 01 implies the existence of a radio - dichotomy .",
    "c03 claimed that a more meaningful quantity is the conditional probability distribution @xmath14 , that is , the @xmath6 distribution for a given ( narrow range of ) @xmath5 , with @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the differential @xmath5 distribution ( `` optical counts '' ) . for comparison with their work , in this contribution",
    "we analyze the behavior of @xmath14 . in the top right panel in figure 1 ,",
    "we show the @xmath6 vs. @xmath5 distribution for @xmath210,000 quasar candidates detected by both sdss and first ( for more details see york 2000 , i02 , schneider et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath14 displayed in the bottom right panel does not decrease smoothly with @xmath6 ; rather , it suggests a possible local minimum around @xmath17 , and a local maximum around @xmath18 .",
    "this distribution is consistent with the c03 best - fit shown by the dashed line in the lower right panel ( the latter is in fact a bimodal function ) .",
    "note that , given the first flux limit shown as the diagonal dot - dashed line in the top right panel , only quasars _ brighter _ than @xmath19 can be used to directly constrain the position of the local minimum in @xmath14 , and thus a large area optical survey such as sdss is required ( as opposed to a deeper survey of a smaller area ) .",
    "-0.25 in    when analyzing the @xmath6 distribution , it is important to realize that the scatter due to k - corrections and quasar variability is much larger than the measurement errors .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath6 ( @xmath20.2 - 0.3 ) is mostly due to optical and radio flux k - corrections , and optical variability .",
    "even if the intrinsic @xmath6 were the same for all quasars ( i.e. a @xmath20-function ) , its observed distribution would still have a finite width because of this uncertainty . in practice , this effect smears any features in @xmath6 distribution and would reduce any bimodality , if not taken into account .",
    "the need to account for the k - correction can be inferred from the improved agreement between different @xmath6 histograms when the sample is divided into redshift bins .",
    "we compared the @xmath14 distributions in different redshift bins using the _ uncorrected _ @xmath6 , and found them to be systematically different .",
    "furthermore , the differences between the @xmath14 distributions for different @xmath5 bins in a given narrow redshift bin are smaller than when the whole redshift range is considered .",
    "this systematic behavior disappears when a proper k - correction for @xmath6 is applied .",
    "we determined the k - correction for @xmath6 , such that @xmath21 , as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are radio and optical spectral slopes , respectively ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we use the difference between @xmath26 color for a particular source and the median @xmath26 color at the redshift of that source to estimate the optical spectral slope ( richards et al .",
    "2003 ) . for radio spectral slope",
    "we assume @xmath23 = -0.5 , which is the median value of radio spectral index for a sample of @xmath2400 quasars with sdss , gb6 , first , nvss and wenss detections ( ivezi et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "-0.25 in    figure 2 compares the distribution of sdss - first quasars with redshifts in the range 0.52.5 in the @xmath6 vs. @xmath5 plane when @xmath6 is * not * k - corrected ( left ) , and when @xmath6 * is * k - corrected using eq .  1 ( right ) . as evident in the bottom panels , accounting for k - correction increases the significance of the detected bimodality .",
    "it is important to use an estimate of the optical spectral slope on an _ object - by - object _ basis  it is insufficient to use a mean slope as obtained from e.g. a composite quasar spectrum .",
    "the dashed line in the bottom right panel in figure 2 is the best - fit using the same functional form proposed by c03 ( a double gaussian ) .",
    "it has a local minimum at @xmath17 and a local maximum at @xmath27 , with the maximum - to - minimum ratio of @xmath22 . as reported by ivezi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the fraction of sources with @xmath28 is 8@xmath291 % .",
    "the remaining 92% of quasars , most of which are not detected by first , are responsible for the steep rise of @xmath14 for @xmath30 .",
    "we conclude that accurate optical and radio measurements for a large and homogeneous sample of radio quasars obtained by sdss and first provide conclusive evidence for the existence of the quasar radio - dichotomy .",
