    "fractional gaussian noises and fractional brownian motions @xcite have served recently as models for a wide variety of data in various fields , like meteorology @xcite , geology @xcite , cardiac dynamics @xcite , finance @xcite .",
    "the concept of fractional gaussian noise ( fgn ) as formulated by mandelbrot and van ness @xcite is a derivative process obtained from fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 . as it has been shown by flandrin @xcite .",
    "even though the fbm is a non - stationary process it obeys a power law over all frequencies . in this study",
    "we use fgn as a model for a climatological signal .    the origin of non - gaussian ,",
    "thus non negligible large and sometimes so called extreme volatility events characterized by so called fat tailed distributions is a key question in statistical physics ; the fat tails of ( short and long - range ) volatilities are thought to be caused by some ` dynamical process ' .",
    "destroying all correlations , e.g. by shuffling the order of the fluctuations , is known to cause the fat tails almost to vanish .",
    "the fat tails indicate an unexpected high probability of large changes .",
    "these extreme events are of utmost importance for risk analysis .",
    "they are considered to be a set of strong bursts in the energy dissipation . in so doing the pdf and the fat tail event existence are thought to be similar to the notion of intermittency in turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "it is an open question whether both the fat - tailed power - law of partial distribution functions ( pdf ) of the various volatilities and their @xmath6 for _ different time delays _ in climatological indices can be described .    on the other hand ,",
    "the non - gaussian character of the fully developed turbulence @xcite has been linked to nonextensive statistical physics @xcite .",
    "it seems that there is no study of tsallis statistics application or approach in climatology @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing phenomena in climatology , known as _",
    "el ni@xmath0o _ , i.e. the more or less cyclic warming and cooling of the eastern and central regions in the pacific ocean , appears to be very complicated to describe @xcite .",
    "there are three sorts of models , based on special types of filters designed specifically to detect a signal from given atmospheric input .",
    "the ability of these models for producing successful forecasts of el ni@xmath0o appears to be concomitant to the _ very low - frequency and large - scale evolution _ of the characteristic patterns in the atmospheric boundary layer circulation .",
    "this evolution can be thought of as a signal that precedes el ni@xmath0o events .",
    "it would be useful to have model - independent results with basic geophysical inputs .",
    "el ni@xmath0o is a disruption of the ocean - atmospheric system in the tropical pacific having important consequences for weather around the globe .",
    "it is factually described by the so called _ southern oscillation index ( soi)_. much of the drastic and tragic events occurring in north america , tropical africa and europe are also attributed to el ni@xmath0o .",
    "there are different ways of characterizing el ni@xmath0o events .",
    "one of them is by the values of an index such as the southern oscillation index ( a proxy measure of el ni@xmath0o based on surface air pressure differences between darwin , australia and tahiti , french polynesia ) @xcite , or large sea surface temperatures ( sst ) and sea surface height ( ssh ) anomalies in the eastern tropical pacific ocean . here",
    "we will use the sea level pressure ( slp ) differences between two meteorological stations , one at tahiti , the other at darwin .",
    "questions on variability of the soi on various time scales are relevant for better modelling .",
    "it was recently found for the southern oscillation index ( soi ) , characterizing el ni@xmath0o events @xcite that long - range correlations exist between the fluctuations of the index .",
    "also , correlation between the soi and the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) index has been reported @xcite having a common oscillation of about @xmath7 years .",
    "the nao was studied _ per se _ , in @xcite .",
    "in this paper the behavior of a climatological index , i.e. the soi , on @xmath8 and @xmath9 time windows ( time scales to be better defined below ) is studied along the lines of a recently suggested model of hydrodynamic turbulence that serves as a dynamic foundation for nonextensive statistics @xcite .    in sect .",
    "2 , we describe the distribution of variability for the monthly value signal of the soi index for the time interval between jan .",
    "1866 and jan .",
    "2006 , thus a series of @xmath101681 months or data points , values downloaded from the climate prediction center web site ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) .",
    "we also characterize the tail(s ) of the distribution for various time lags @xmath13 s , i.e. from 1 month up to 36  months ( or 3 years ! ) , and will observe the value of the pdf tails , for such time lags , outside the best gaussian fit through the data .",
    "there are several ways of displaying features in the variability of a climatological index .",
    "a simple one represents value increment @xmath14 or difference between the value of the index @xmath15 at time @xmath16 and its value at time @xmath17 .",
    "below we mainly consider the _ normalized variability _",
    "@xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the average and @xmath20 the standard deviation of @xmath21 for a given @xmath22 .",
    "the normalized variability @xmath23 depend on the time @xmath17 and the time lag @xmath13 .",
    "however , in order to simplify the notations and whenever possible without leading to confusion and misunderstanding we will drop the explicit writing of one or both variables .    in sect .",
    "3 , we calculate the power law exponents characterizing the @xmath24 distribution of the normalized variability over different time lags for the soi index monthly values through a detrended fluctuation analysis and a power spectral density analysis point of view .    in all cases",
    "it is useful to test the null hypothesis or estimate the error bars with respect to standard signals .",
    "it is thought @xcite that the fat tails are caused by long - range volatility correlations .",
    "destroying all correlations by shuffling the order of the fluctuations , is known to cause the fat tails almost to vanish . a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( not shown ) on shuffled data",
    "has indicated us the statistical validity of the numerical values and the statistically acceptable meaning of the displayed error bars .",
    "results are compared to shuffled data for estimating the value of the error bars .    in sect .",
    "4 , tsallis statistical approach is outlined , and distributions of ( normalized ) variability for time lags between @xmath13 = 1 to 36  months are examined .",
    "the nonextensivity , i.e. some anomalous scaling of classically extensive properties like the entropy , is linked to a single parameter @xmath25 , e.g. in the tsallis formulation of nonextensive thermostatistics .",
    "it is found that the @xmath25-value of the nonextensive entropy converges to a value = 1.01 for @xmath13 = 36  months , starting with @xmath25 = 1.25 for @xmath13 = 1 .",
    "the probability density @xmath26 of the volatility @xmath27 in terms of the standard deviation of the normalized variability of the soi for different time lags is found to obey the @xmath1-distribution .",
    "the intermittency exponent ( @xmath3 ) of the kolmogorov log - normal model is found to be related to the scaling exponent of the pdf moments , -thereby giving weight to this model .    in sect .",
    "5 , the usual fokker - planck approach for treating the time - dependent probability distribution functions is summarized .",
    "coefficients governing both the fokker - planck equation for the distribution function of normalized variability and the langevin equation for the time evolution of normalized variability of monthly value signal of soi are obtained .",
    "therefore we present for the first time a coherent theory linking the shape and tails of partial distribution functions for long and short time lags of the monthly values of a climatological signal and connect the often suggested turbulent nature of the ocean - atmospheric interface interactions to a model encompassing nonextensive statistics and evolution equations of the langevin and fokker - planck type .",
    "we will often compare results based on normalized variability and non normalized variability time series .",
    "monthly values of the soi index for the time interval between jan .",
    "1866 and jan .",
    "2006 were downloaded from the joint institute for study of the atmosphere and ocean ( jisao ) web site @xmath28 @xmath29 for the longest period available there , i.e. from jan .",
    "1866 to june 1999 .",
    "data for the time interval from july 1999 to jan .",
    "2006 were downloaded from the climate prediction center ncep web site ( @xmath30 ) . for the years before 1866 daily measurements of the sea level pressure at both stations",
    "have been reported to exist and monthly values of the southern oscillation index have been calculated @xcite back to 1841 . however , there are gaps of a couple of years in the record whence not suitable for our analysis .",
    "we have chosen the jisao s data for the period before july 1999 , since they do not contain missing values as the data series from ncep do .",
    "the data are fully compatible because the standardization of both jisao and ncep data series is calculated through the standard deviation @xmath31 of the sea level pressure ( slp ) at a station in tahiti and the sea level pressure at a station in darwin    @xmath32    such soi monthly data are plotted as a function of time in fig .",
    "1 . the data set consists of @xmath33 data points .",
    "it is sometimes stated that daily or weekly values of the soi do not convey much in the way of useful information about the current state of the climate , and accordingly the bureau of meteorology does not issue them .",
    "daily values in particular can fluctuate markedly because of daily weather patterns , and should not be used for climate purposes .",
    "we may disagree with this statement ( provided the reliability of the data ) .",
    "there are indeed techniques which can sort out noise from coherent behavior @xcite",
    ".    sustained negative values of the soi often indicate el ni@xmath0o episodes @xcite .",
    "these negative values are usually accompanied by sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean , a decrease in the strength of the pacific trade winds , and a reduction in rainfall over eastern and northern australia .",
    "the most recent strong el ni@xmath0o was in 1997/98 .",
    "positive values of the soi are associated with stronger pacific trade winds and warmer sea temperatures to the north of australia , popularly known as a la ni@xmath0a episode .",
    "waters in the central and eastern tropical pacific ocean become cooler during this time . together",
    "these give an increased probability that eastern and northern australia will be wetter than normal .",
    "the most recent strong la ni@xmath0a was in 1988/89 ; a moderate la ni@xmath0a event occurred in 1998/99 , which weakened back to neutral conditions before reforming for a shorter period in 1999/2000 .",

    "2a . the partial distribution of non normalized variability @xmath34 of the monthly value signal of soi index is plotted in fig 2b as we will later compare some of our findings for both @xmath35 and @xmath34 . for comparison",
    "a fit is first attempted with a gaussian distribution for @xmath36 values of the increments , i.e. the central part of the distribution .",
    "the distribution is well fitted with such a gaussian type curve within the interval @xmath37 - 2,2[$ ] but departs from the gaussian form outside this interval .",
    "the negative and positive tails of the distribution outside the gaussian curve are found both to be equal to -5.6 . in the case",
    "@xmath38 1  month , it is observed that the best gaussian range is increasing with increasing time lag ( fig .",
    "there are different estimators for the long and/or short range dependence of fluctuations correlations @xcite .    through the ( linearly ) detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) method ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite , we show first that the _ long range correlations _ of monthly value signal of soi for the time interval of interest , are @xmath39-like .",
    "the method has been used previously to identify whether long range correlations exist in non - stationary signals , in many research fields such as e.g. finance @xcite , cardiac dynamics @xcite and of course meteorology @xcite .",

    "4 ) in a scaling range extending from about 4 to about 66 - 72  months . a signal with hausdorff dimension @xmath48 close to zero has the characteristics of a fractional gaussian noise signal @xcite .    along the same line of thought the scaling properties of the normalized variability @xmath49 have also been tested for different time lag values , i.e. @xmath50  months ( fig .",
    "the dfa functions , as defined here above , of the integrated normalized variability shows non trivial scaling properties for the series of normalized variability .",
    "the values of the scaling exponents and the maximum box size @xmath51 ( in days ) for which the scaling holds for each dfa - function are given in table [ table1 ] , while the dfa - functions together with fitting lines are plotted in fig .",
    "the power spectrum of the monthly value signal of soi @xmath52 with spectral exponents @xmath53 and @xmath54 with a scale break at 1/70  months@xmath55 is shown in fig .",
    "the scaling properties of the power spectrum of two surrogate data , one in which the amplitudes are randomly shuffled and another in which the magnitudes are preserved but the sign of the data is shuffled , are shown in the inserts of fig . 6 .",
    "such scaling spectral exponents @xmath56 are signature of a white noise like behavior .",
    "recall that @xmath57 corresponds to usual brownian motion .",
    "the theoretical relationship @xmath58 is approximately verified , - the weak agreement being likely due to the quite limited data size .    we have also checked for scaling behavior and possible periodicities in the power spectrum of the time series of the normalized variability @xmath59 for different ( selected ) values of the time lag @xmath60  months ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "periodicities in the power spectrum of the normalized variability time series for @xmath61  month were expected to be found since these periods are somewhat embedded into the time series by the way they are obtained and the fourier transform technique .",

    "we have mainly studied the evolution process of the tails that are outside the central ( gaussian ) regime,- which of course occurs only at small variability , thereby facilitating the understanding of the evolution of these distribution functions in a fokker - planck framework .",
    "the gaussian regime range has been found to imply that signal correlations extend up to @xmath2 48 months , - an interesting time lag to be considered in microscopic evolution model(s ) of el ni@xmath0o .",
    "it has been found that beck turbulence model can be well applied to describe the distributions of the standard deviation of the soi signal normalized variability assuming a @xmath1-distribution for these . in some sense",
    "this application ( or generalization of the model ) is justified by the fact that the ideas behind the turbulence model , based on temperature fluctuations , can be expected to be carried over to the case in which pressure fluctuations occur in the system .    an open question in nonextensive thermostatistics studies",
    "is often raised about the meaning , value and behavior of the non extensive exponent , or tsallis parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the intermittency exponent is interestingly found to be related to the scaling exponent of the pdf moments in the framework of kolmogorov log - normal model , thereby giving weight to the model and the statistical approach .",
    "we have also presented the turbulence - like dynamics through the fokker - planck and the langevin equations .",
    "we have ( as it has been expected ) found that , in the treated case , there is some ` restoring force ' , i.e. ( @xmath157 in the langevin equation ) .",
    "a comparison is made between normalized variability and non normalized variability .",
    "whence we have related a climatological signal behavior to tsallis non extensive thermodynamics approach , i.e. more precisely to a turbulence - like process , - as climatological ocean - atmospheric interface interactions and indices were often claimed to be seen .",
    "no need to say that this empirical modeling only @xmath158 the evolution of the signal but does not @xmath159 it , as a general circulation model @xcite should do . nevertheless the time scales which are hereby observed might shine some light on approximation validity or the need to restrict extrapolations to realistic ranges , - including memory effects .",
    "finally , it seems that we have thoroughly answered the often raised question ` why to look at the tails of a probability distribution function ? and what does that lead to ? ' .",
