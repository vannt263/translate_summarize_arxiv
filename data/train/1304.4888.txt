    "heterogeneous media with multiple scales and high - contrast commonly occur in many applications , such as porous media and material sciences .",
    "the development of reduced - order models describing complex processes in such media is needed in such applications .",
    "there are a variety of multiscale methods , e.g. @xcite , that efficiently capture multiscale behavior by constructing a reduced representation of the solution space on a coarse grid .",
    "while standard multiscale methods have proven effective for a variety of applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in this paper we consider a more recent framework , gmsfem , in which the coarse spaces may be systematically enriched to converge to the fine grid solution .",
    "in particular , we develop oversampling techniques within gmsfem and show that these methods converge independent of the small scales and high contrast under certain assumptions .",
    "the generalized multiscale finite element method ( gmsfem ) is a flexible framework that generalizes the multiscale finite element method ( msfem ) by systematically enriching the coarse spaces and taking into account small scale information and complex input spaces .",
    "this approach , as in many multiscale model reduction techniques , divides the computation into two stages : offline and online . in the offline stage",
    ", a small dimensional space is constructed that can be efficiently used in the online stage to construct multiscale basis functions .",
    "these multiscale basis functions can be re - used for any input parameter to solve the problem on a coarse grid . the main idea behind",
    "the construction of offline and online spaces is the selection of local spectral problems and the selection of the snapshot space . in @xcite ,",
    "we propose several general strategies . in this paper , our focus is on the development of oversampling strategies .",
    "oversampling techniques have been developed in the context of multiscale finite element methods @xcite as well as upscaling methods @xcite .",
    "these techniques use the local solutions in larger domains to construct multiscale basis functions in the context of msfem .",
    "we borrow that main concept in this paper .",
    "in particular , we use the space of snapshots in the oversampled regions by constructing a snapshot space spanned by harmonic functions or dominant eigenvectors of a local spectral problem formulated in the oversampled domain .",
    "furthermore , we use special local spectral problems to determine the dominant modes in the space of snapshots .",
    "this spectral problem is motivated by the analysis and it uses a weighted mass matrix in the oversampled region while the energy ( stiffness ) matrix is constructed in the target coarse domain . by choosing the dominant modes , we identify multiscale basis functions .",
    "these basis functions are then multiplied by partition of unity functions to solve the flow equation on a coarse grid ( in the absence of the parameter ) .",
    "we also describe the use of multiple local spectral problems for enhancing the accuracy of the approximation and discuss their relation to single spectral problems that use oversampled regions where the latter provides an optimal space . in the presence of the parameter",
    ", we also design an online space following the same strategy as the offline space construction ( but using an online parameter value ) .",
    "we employ the galerkin finite element method , though discontinuous galerkin methods can also be used @xcite .",
    "we present numerical results that demonstrate the convergence of the proposed methods . in our numerical experiments , we test two different snapshot spaces that consist of harmonic functions in the oversampled region and dominant eigenmodes of a local spectral problem in the oversampled region . for the local spectral problems ,",
    "we also consider various choices by considering mass and energy matrices in the oversampled regions .",
    "our numerical results show that the proposed methods converge as we increase the dimension of the space and this convergence is consistent with our theoretical findings .",
    "we also test the use of multiple spectral problems in constructing basis functions as well as modifying the conductivity outside the target block to improve the accuracy .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section , section [ prelim ]",
    ", we present the problem setting and the definitions of coarse grids . in section [ locbasis ] , we present the construction of local basis functions . section [ sec : numex ] is devoted to the numerical results . in section",
    "[ appendix : convergence ] we present the analysis of the method and in section [ sec : conclusions ] we offer some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider elliptic equations of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is prescribed on @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a parameter .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 and that the coefficient @xmath5 has multiple scale and high variations ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ perm ] for @xmath6 and @xmath7 used in simulations ) .",
    "to discretize ( [ eq : original ] ) , we next introduce the notion of fine and coarse grids .",
    "we let @xmath8 be a usual conforming partition of the computational domain @xmath9 into finite elements ( triangles , quadrilaterals , tetrahedrals , etc . ) . we refer to this partition as the coarse grid and",
    "assume that each coarse subregion is partitioned into a connected union of fine grid blocks .",
    "the fine grid partition will be denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "we use @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 the number of coarse nodes ) to denote the vertices of the coarse mesh @xmath8 , and define the neighborhood of the node @xmath13 by @xmath14 see fig .  [ schematic ] for an illustration of neighborhoods and elements subordinated to the coarse discretization .",
    "furthermore , we introduce a notation for an oversampled region .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 an oversampled region of @xmath16 . in general",
    ", we will consider oversampled regions @xmath15 defined by adding several fine - grid or coarse - grid layers around @xmath17 .",
    "next , we briefly outline the global coupling and the role of coarse basis functions for the respective formulations that we consider . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the continuous galerkin formulation , and use @xmath17 as the support of basis functions even though @xmath15 will be used in constructing multiscale basis functions . for the purpose of this description , we formally denote the basis functions of the online space @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "the solution will be sought as @xmath20 .",
    "once the basis functions are identified , the global coupling is given through the variational form @xmath21 and @xmath22 we note that in the case when the coefficient is independent of the parameter , then @xmath23 .",
    "in this section we describe the offline - online computational procedure , and elaborate on some applicable choices for the associated bilinear forms to be used in the coarse space construction .",
    "below we offer a general outline for the procedure .    * offline computations : * * 1.0 .",

    "solution of a coarse - grid problem for any force term and boundary condition . * * 2.3 .",
    "iterative solvers , if needed .",
    "in the offline computation , we first construct a snapshot space @xmath24 or @xmath25 , depending on the choice of domain to generate the snapshot space , where @xmath26 is an oversampled region that contains a coarse neighborhood @xmath17 .",
    "construction of the snapshot space involves solving the local problems for various choices of input parameters , and we describe the details below .",
    "our first choice of snapshot space consists of harmonic extension of fine - grid functions defined on the boundary of @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , for each fine - grid function , @xmath27 , which is defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the fine - grid boundary node on @xmath30 .    for parameter - independent problem , we solve @xmath31 subject to boundary condition , @xmath32 on @xmath30 .    for parameter - dependent one , we can choose several values @xmath33 ( @xmath34 denotes the number of parameters used ) to generate the snapshot space separately as above and combine them to obtain the snapshot space ( see details in section [ sec : pdcase ] ) .",
    "we propose to solve the following zero neumann eigenvalue problem on an oversampled domain @xmath26 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is a specified set of fixed parameter values , and we emphasize that the superscript @xmath38 signifies that the eigenvalue problem is solved in an oversampled coarse subdomain @xmath26 .",
    "the matrices in eq .   are defined as @xmath39 = \\int_{\\omega_i^+ } \\kappa(x ; \\mu_j ) \\nabla \\phi_n \\cdot \\nabla \\phi_m \\quad \\text{and } \\quad s^+(\\mu_j ) = [ s^+(\\mu_j)_{mn } ] = \\int_{\\omega_i^+ } \\widetilde{\\kappa}(x ; \\mu_j )   \\phi_n \\phi_m,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes the standard bilinear , fine - scale basis functions and the form for @xmath41 will be discussed in section [ appendix : convergence ] . in our numerical implementations , we take @xmath42 , though one can use multiscale basis functions , @xmath43 in @xmath15 , to construct @xmath41 as @xmath44 ( see @xcite for more discussions on the choice of partition of unity functions ) .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "is the discretized form of the continuous equation @xmath45 after solving eq .",
    ", we keep the first @xmath46 eigenfunctions corresponding to the dominant eigenvalues ( asymptotically vanishing in this case ) to form the space @xmath47 for each oversampled coarse neighborhood @xmath26 .",
    "we note that in the case when @xmath17 is adjacent to the global boundary , no oversampled domain is used . for the sake of simplicity , throughout , we denote continuous and discrete solutions by the same symbol ( e.g. , @xmath48 in the above case ) .",
    "we reorder the snapshot functions using a single index to create the matrices @xmath49 \\quad \\text{and } \\quad r_{\\text{snap } } = \\left [ \\psi_{1}^{\\text{snap } } , \\ldots , \\psi_{m_{\\text{snap}}}^{\\text{snap } } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes the restriction of @xmath51 to @xmath17 , and @xmath52 denotes the total number of functions to keep in the snapshot matrix construction .",
    "note that the above process to generate local spectral basis is also applied to parameter - independent problems .",
    "we will discuss two types of offline spaces where the first one will use one spectral problem in the snapshot space and the other one will use multiple spectral problems in the snapshot space ( following theorem 3.3 of @xcite ) .      in order to construct an oversampled offline space @xmath53 or standard neighborhood offline space @xmath54",
    ", we perform a dimension reduction in the space of snapshots using an auxiliary spectral decomposition .",
    "the main objective is to use the offline space to efficiently ( and accurately ) construct a set of multiscale basis functions for each @xmath3 value in the online stage .",
    "more precisely , we seek a subspace of the snapshot space such that it can approximate any element of the snapshot space in the appropriate sense defined via auxiliary bilinear forms . at the offline stage",

    "in particular , there is no need for averaging the coefficients in order to create the respective ( offline ) mass and ( offline ) stiffness matrices .",
    "furthermore , the offline space represents the final space in which the enriched multiscale solutions will be computed .",
    "thus , the discussion of online space creation below is limited to the case when the problem is parameter - dependent .",
