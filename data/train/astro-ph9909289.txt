    "the metal - rich globular clusters play a fundamental rle in determining the formation history of our galaxy ( e.g. minniti @xcite , @xcite ; ortolani et al .",
    "@xcite ; zinn @xcite ; barbuy et al .",
    "@xcite ; rich @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , they provide a crucial template for interpreting the integrated spectra of elliptical galaxies and for understanding the evolution of old metal - rich stellar systems .",
    "the horizontal branch ( hb ) stars in the metal - rich clusters are particularly important , since they provide a standard candle for determining distances ( and hence ages ) and are believed to be the major contributors to the uv - upturn phenomenon ( e.g. caloi @xcite ; greggio & renzini 1990 , 1999 ; bressan et al .",

    "recent _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) observations have found that the metal - rich globular clusters ngc  6388 ( c1732447 ) and ngc  6441 ( c1746370 ) ( @xmath1 } = -0.60 $ ] and @xmath2 , respectively ; harris @xcite ) contain an unexpected population of hot hb stars and therefore exhibit the well - known second parameter effect ( rich et al .",
    "most surprisingly , the mean hb luminosity at the top of the blue hb tail is roughly 0.5  mag brighter in @xmath3 than the red hb  clump , \" which itself is strongly sloped as well .",
    "differential reddening can not be the cause of these sloped hb s",
    "( piotto et al .",
    "@xcite ; sweigart & catelan @xcite ; layden et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the second parameter effect has often been attributed to differences in age or mass loss on the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "however , canonical hb simulations show that increasing the assumed age or rgb mass loss moves an hb star blueward in the @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 plane but does not increase its luminosity .",
    "thus some other second parameter(s ) must be causing the sloped hb s in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( sweigart & catelan @xcite , hereafter sc98 ) .      1 .",
    "* high cluster helium abundance scenario * : red hb stars evolve along blue loops during most of their hb lifetime . for larger than  standard \" helium abundances @xmath5 ,",
    "these loops become considerably longer , reaching higher effective temperatures and deviating more in luminosity from the zero - age hb ( zahb ) .",
    "if the cluster stars form with sufficiently high @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , the hb will slope upward ( catelan & de freitas pacheco @xcite ) , as observed in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "however , this scenario also predicts a much larger value for the number ratio @xmath7 of hb to rgb stars than the value recently obtained by layden et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for ngc  6441 .",
    "thus a high primordial helium abundance seems to be ruled out as the cause of the sloped hb s and will not be considered further in this paper .",
    "* rotation scenario * : rotation during the rgb phase can delay the helium flash , thereby increasing both the final helium - core mass and the amount of mass loss near the tip of the rgb .",
    "the net effect is to shift a star s hb location towards higher effective temperatures and luminosities , depending on the amount of rotation .",
    "this scenario predicts a sloped hb with the shift towards higher luminosities ( and hence lower gravities ) increasing with effective temperature ( rood & crocker @xcite ) .",
    "+ [ cols= \" < , > , < , < , > , > \" , ]     considering the estimated errors in @xmath8  and @xmath9  the positions of ngc  6388 wf242 , wf314 , wf420 , and ngc  6441 wf317 , however , are consistent with the canonical zahb within 2@xmath10 .",
    "ngc  6388 wf315 could be a blue hb star already on its way to the asymptotic giant branch  as we observed rather bright blue hb stars at the top of the blue tail in both clusters we are biased towards stars evolving from the zahb towards higher luminosities .",
    "ngc  6441 wf316 lies marginally more than 2@xmath10 below the unmixed zahb , but has also the lowest s / n of all observed stars .",
    "ngc  6441 wf224 lies 0.7  dex in @xmath9  below the canonical zahb along the track of a 0.195  @xmath11  helium white dwarf ( driebe et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    "it would be a foreground object and most probably member of a binary system having undergone mass transfer , as the low mass single star precursors of helium white dwarfs evolve too slowly to reach this stage within a hubble time .",
    "while helium white dwarfs evolve rather fast and the probability of finding one is therefore rather low , we could not find any other physical explanation for a star like ngc  6441 wf224 . as we are not able to derive radial velocities",
    "( see sect .",
    "[ bulge_sec_obs ] ) we can not decide whether this star is a cluster member or not .",
    "the derived gravities ( except for ngc  6388 wf315 ) are _ significantly _ larger than those predicted by the non - canonical tracks that reproduce the upward sloping hb s in the colour - magnitude diagrams of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( see sect .",
    "[ bulge_sec_intro ] ) . the discrepancy would increase if the atmospheric abundances of the programme stars ( and thereby their line profiles ) were affected by the radiative levitation of metals ( grundahl et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as shown by moehler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) accounting for this effect moves the parameters of blue hb stars in ngc  6752 to lower temperatures and/or higher gravities .",
    "however , the moderate resolution and s / n of the data discussed here do not allow abundances of the heavy elements to be estimated .",
    "we do not have an explanation for this surprising result .",
    "all the scenarios laid out by sc98 and discussed in sect .",
    "[ bulge_sec_intro ] predict anomalously low gravities for cluster blue hb stars within the temperature range of our programme stars . as far as we are aware",
    ", there are no alternative models capable of accounting for the sloped hb s seen in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 without producing anomalously bright hb stars and hence low gravities . in fact , recent analyses of rr lyrae variables in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( sc98 ; layden et al .",
    "@xcite ; pritzl et al .",
    "@xcite ) _ strongly _ indicate that the hb s of these globular clusters are substantially brighter than canonical models would predict .",
    "thus we face a conundrum : the non - canonical models which explain the upward sloping hb s in these globular clusters are inconsistent with the derived gravities .",
