    "this conjecture remains largely unsolved ; see @xcite for a recent survey of known results .",
    "the bounded derived category @xmath4 has come to be understood as a homological replacement for the variety @xmath5 ; exceptional collections provide a way to break up @xmath4 into simple components .",
    "such decompositions of the derived category can be seen as analogous to decompositions of the motive of @xmath5 , a relationship that has been put into a conjectural framework by orlov  @xcite . as an example",
    ", the existence of a full exceptional collection implies a splitting of the chow motive @xmath7 into twists of lefschetz motives @xcite .",

    "finally , a @xmath12-exceptional collection of vector bundles @xmath13 is said to be of the _ expected length _ if the cardinality of @xmath11 equals the minimal number of generators of the abelian group @xmath15 .",

    "we address the following closely related question :    let @xmath5 be the variety of borel subgroups of a split semisimple linear algebraic group @xmath0 and fix a partial order @xmath12 on the weyl group @xmath11 of @xmath0 .",
    "does @xmath4 have a @xmath12-exceptional collection of the expected length consisting of line bundles ?    on the one hand , the question strengthens the conjecture by requiring the collection to consist of line bundles . on the other hand ,",
    "it weakens the conjecture by allowing partial orders ( such as the weak or strong bruhat orders ) instead of a total order and allowing the collection to merely generate @xmath15 .",
    "so far , a natural way to propagate known exceptional collections of line bundles is to use the result of orlov ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.7 ) , that @xmath4 has a full exceptional collection of line bundles if there exists a ( zariski locally trivial ) projective bundle @xmath16 such that @xmath17 has a full exceptional collection of line bundles .",
    "more generally , @xmath4 has a full exceptional collection of line bundles if @xmath5 is the total space of a smooth zariski locally trivial fibration , whose fiber and base both have derived categories with full exceptional collections of line bundles @xcite .",
    "we remark that the result of orlov on semiorthogonal decompositions of projective bundles ( hence that of belinson and bernten  gelfand  gelfand on @xmath18 ) holds over an arbitrary noetherian base scheme , cf .",
    "using such techniques , one immediately answers the question positively for all projective homogeneous varieties @xmath5 associated to split semisimple groups of rank 2 , except in the following cases :  type @xmath19 and @xmath5 a 3-dimensional quadric ; and type @xmath3 and all @xmath5 ( this includes the case of 5-dimensional quadrics ) .",
    "these exceptions can be viewed as key motivating examples for the present paper .",
    "it is not necessarily expected that a @xmath12-exceptional collection of line bundles of the expected length exists for every projective homogeneous variety .",
    "for instance , certain grassmannians of type @xmath20 have full exceptional collections of vector bundles , but not of line bundles .",
    "this distinction is highlighted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem  1.2 ) . observe also that if @xmath15 is not generated by line bundles , then @xmath4 can not possess a @xmath12-exceptional collection of line bundles of the expected length for obvious reasons .",

    ".... collections = { } ;   findcollections[l1 _ , l2 _ ] : = module[{tmpl1 } ,     if[length[l2 ] = = 0 , appendto[collections , l1 ] ,      do [       tmpl1 = append[l1 , l2[[i ] ] ] ;       findcollections[tmpl1 ,         select[delete[l2 , i ] , issingular [ # - l2[[i ] ] + rho ] & ] ] ,         { i , 1 , length[l2 ] } ] ] ] ; ....    for example , to check fact  [ nodmz ] , we constructed the list ` l2 ` consisting of all 445 non - far weights in the crab and executed ` findcollections[{{0 , 0 } } , l2 ] ` to obtain the list of the @xmath417 maximal exceptional collections @xmath265 with all @xmath280 non - far . with this list in hand ,",
    "it is not difficult to select out collections meeting the criteria of facts  [ forty ] and [ close ] .",
    "this section will complete the proof of theorem  [ g2 ] .",
    "fix a crab line of interest and let @xmath267 be an exceptional collection . by restricting to a sub - list",
    ", we may assume that all of the weights @xmath268 lie on that crab line .",
    "by corollary  [ pts20 ] , @xmath269 is one of the 20 weights for @xmath270 , and figure [ 20points.fig ] shows that @xmath419 has length at most 5 corresponding to having 6 weights on the line of interest , and that the proof is complete except in the case where the crab line makes a 120@xmath296  angle with the horizontal .    for that line",
    ", we must argue that @xmath420 can not be the 5 weights of the 20 depicted in the figure . indeed ,",
    "if they were , one could translate by @xmath421 to transform this to an exceptional collections @xmath422 and @xmath423 must belong to the crab for @xmath424 .",
    "but we can see from the figure that this does not happen for any of the 5 choices for @xmath421 , hence the claim .",
    "in the exceptional collection @xmath265 , let @xmath426 be three weights on @xmath199 .",
    "then every nonzero weight @xmath253 in the collection and off @xmath199 either precedes @xmath427 or follows @xmath365 .",
    "first suppose @xmath253 precedes @xmath427 .",
    "then by the baa lemma  [ baa ] , either @xmath428 are all near or @xmath253 is on the singular line parallel to @xmath199 . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath253 is one of the 20 weights and so is near .",
    "suppose that @xmath253 follows @xmath305 , then shifting by @xmath429 gives an exceptional collection @xmath333 where @xmath311 is one of the 20 weights . by the dichotomy proposition  [ key ]",
    ", we have two possibilities :    we could have that @xmath430 , but in that case we find that @xmath431 hence @xmath432 . but @xmath253 and @xmath371 lie on different crab lines , so by the trigonometry lemma  [ trig ] , we find that @xmath433 is at most @xmath434 . if @xmath435 , then @xmath436 and @xmath253 is near .",
    "( note that if @xmath371 is non - near , then we would have @xmath437 and this case is impossible . )    alternately , @xmath438 could lie on @xmath199 . in that case , as @xmath253 is not on @xmath199 , corollary  [ crab.diff ] gives that @xmath439 .",
    "thus all weights in the exceptional collection off @xmath199 are near .    it remains to argue that the collection has length @xmath233 .",
    "if the weights on @xmath199 are non - far , then all the weights in the collection are non - far and we are done by fact  [ nodmz ] . therefore , we may assume that some of the weights on @xmath199 are far , hence all weights on @xmath199 are non - near .",
    "let @xmath253 be a nonzero weight in the collection that is off @xmath199 .",
    "if it precedes @xmath427 , then @xmath253 is one of the 20 weights ( because @xmath428 can not all be near ) .",
    "otherwise , @xmath253 comes after @xmath365 and we are in case 2 above , so @xmath440 ; by proposition  [ mirror_farclose ] , @xmath253 is one of the mirror 20 weights and lies on the mirror singular line parallel to @xmath199 .",
    "fact  [ forty ] and lemma [ maxpts ] show that one can not obtain an exceptional collection of length @xmath441 .",
    "we claim that the number @xmath85 of far weights in the collection is 1 or 2",
    ". indeed , by fact  [ nodmz ] , @xmath85 is positive .",
    "suppose that it is at least 3 . then by proposition  [ triplet ] ,",
    "all far weights lie on different crab lines , leaving @xmath443 crab lines for the remaining @xmath444 nonzero weights ; but the remaining crab lines can only hold @xmath445 weights , which contradicts our hypothesis that @xmath446 ; hence @xmath447 or 2 .",
    "otherwise , the two far weights are on different crab liens .",
    "we claim that one of these crab lines , call it @xmath199 , contains exactly one weight from the exceptional collection .",
    "indeed , otherwise there would be two crab lines each containing two weights ; as all of these are non - near by corollary [ lmp ] , this contradicts proposition [ triplet ] , verifying the claim .",
    "we take @xmath412 to be the far weights in the exceptional collection .",
    "we have found @xmath412 as desired , and deleting it from the exceptional collection leaves one as in fact [ close ] and we conclude that @xmath415 for all @xmath280 not in @xmath412 .",
    "if such a @xmath280 precedes one of the far weights , then it is one of the 20 weights by the dichotomy proposition  [ key ] ; if it follows one of the far weights then it is one of the mirror 20 weights by proposition  [ mirror_farclose ] . but deleting @xmath412 from our exceptional collection leaves an exceptional collection starting with 0 and containing at least @xmath451 nonzero , non - far weights all lying off @xmath199 , which contradicts fact [ forty ] .",
