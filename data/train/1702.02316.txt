    "in the last two decades , it has been found that solar energetic particles ( seps ) in gradual events are generated from particle acceleration by shock waves accompanying coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) ( see reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "it was confirmed by both the correspondence of the solar corona composition with the sep composition , on average , and a close association of gradual events with cmes .",
    "observations show that sep generation occurs in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "sep injection into interplanetary space begins about 0.21 hr after the beginning of cme motion @xcite . at the beginning of sep injection ,",
    "the cme radius is 3  ",
    "5 @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the solar radius .",
    "the injection of seps with @xmath3 mev nucleon@xmath4 has a characteristic behavior : a fast increase to the maximum value is followed by an exponential decrease . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the kinetic energy per nucleon . at the same time , the higher @xmath5 is , the earlier the injection reaches its maximum value , and the characteristic decreasing timescale @xmath6 . in the events registered by ground - based detectors ( gle ; @xmath7 gev ) the injection reaches its maximum value when the cme radius is within 4  ",
    "30 @xmath2 and @xmath8 hr . the seps injected during a decreasing phase are generated in the regions within 5",
    "  30 @xmath0 .",
    "all observations of seps in gradual events imply that particle acceleration occurs in the region from 2 to 30 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the particles effectively accelerates at the shock front because of a rather high level of background and self - consistently generated turbulence , as well as the high cme speed .    in interplanetary space ,",
    "acceleration efficiency significantly decreases since the level of background turbulence @xcite is much less than in the solar corona .",
    "thus , the seps accelerated in the solar corona escape from the vicinity of the shock front . the temporal behavior of sep flux in gradual events at the earth s orbit depends on particle energy . the flux of seps with energies @xmath9 mev nucleon@xmath4 after increasing remains almost constant until the shock front reaches the earth s orbit the region of a plateau in the temporary event profile @xcite . the flux of seps with @xmath10 mev nucleon@xmath4 after the plateau region increases , reaching the maximum value at the shock front  the region of energetic storm particles ( esps ) @xcite . after passing the shock front , sep spectra exponentially decrease with time at scales @xmath11 hr , retaining their power - law shape the region of invariant sep spectrum decrease @xcite .",
    "there are different approaches in theoretically describing sep generation and propagation .",
    "@xcite presented the model of proton acceleration at the expanding shock wave ; it is an analogue of the model used by @xcite to describe the particle acceleration in supernova remnants . in the solution ,",
    "the accelerated particle spectrum at a plane shock is used , which is subsequently modified by diffusion , convection , and adiabatic energy losses in the expanding spherical cme volume .",
    "they assume that the generation of self - consistent turbulence is very effective that the diffusion coefficient reaches the bohm limit .",
    "the model results and observational properties of some gradual events are generally in agreement .",
    "an analytical theory of ion acceleration at spherical shock waves was presented by @xcite .",
    "the theory is based on works @xcite containing coupled ion acceleration and wave generation at the plane shock front .",
    "the achievement of this new theory is that it includes a continuous transition from the region with frequent particles scattering near the shock front to the region with almost free propagation far from the shock front .",
    "the theory s simplification is reached by using of stationary particle spectra and self - consistent waves during the entire time of the shock movement .",
    "particle acceleration based on the numerical solution of the diffusive transport equation under the solar corona conditions was considered in the works of @xcite .",
    "both linear and nonlinear cases of the problem are considered with the self - consistent turbulence generation by the accelerated particles .",
    "the parameters of the model are determined from the comparison of the calculated particle spectra with sep spectra in gradual events .",
    "these models did not take into account the following : ( 1 ) cme influence on the shock speed , ( 2 ) influence of the region behind the shock front on particle acceleration , and ( 3 ) dependence of the accelerated particle spectra on the initial cme radius in the solar corona .    here",
    "we present the results of a linear model of particle acceleration at an expanding spherical shock wave in the the solar corona .",
    "the spectra are determined by numerically solving the diffusive transport equation .",
    "in the calculations , we use the relation between the cme and the shock speeds determined by the solution of the gas - dynamic equations .",
    "the influence of the region behind the shock front on particle acceleration is investigated .",
    "the dependence of particle spectra on the initial cme radius is explored .",
    "the model parameters are determined by comparing the calculated particle spectra with sep spectra in gradual events .",
    "an accuracy estimate of the code is given in the appendix .",
    "we suggest that the sep acceleration occurs in the region limited to a few solar radii @xcite .",
    "we also take into account that ( 1 ) the magnetic field is radial in the acceleration region @xcite , ( 2 ) high - energy particles in the solar atmosphere are strongly magnetized , so that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the diffusion coefficients across and along the magnetic field , respectively . in this case , the particle acceleration in the central part of the shock weakly depends on its configuration and is the same as in the spherical symmetric case . the corresponding transport equation for the isotropic part of the distribution function @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient along the magnetic field ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the momentum , radius and time , respectively ; @xmath21 is the velocity of the scattering centers ; @xmath22 is the plasma flow velocity ; @xmath23 is the particle source concentrated at the shock front ; and @xmath24 is the shock front radius .",
    "we assume that the shock front and the cme ( piston ) are segments of spherical surfaces with radii @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "particles are scattered by alfven waves moving along the magnetic field lines in opposite directions .",
    "the velocity of the scattering centers @xmath26 in the region ahead of the shock front ( @xmath27 ) is determined as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the alfven waves magnetic energy densities over frequency , moving from and to the sun , respectively ; @xmath30 ; @xmath31 is the alfven speed ; @xmath32 is the magnetic field strength ; @xmath33 is the plasma density ; and @xmath34 is the frequency . in the region behind the shock front ( @xmath35 ) ,",
    "the directions of wave propagation become isotropic ( @xmath36 ) , resulting in @xmath37 .",
    "the plasma velocity @xmath38 and the velocity of the scattering centers @xmath39 in the shock rest frame changes abruptly from the values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 at @xmath42 to @xmath43 at @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the shock speed ; @xmath46 is the shock compression ratio ; @xmath47 is the adiabatic index ; @xmath48 is the sonic mach number ; @xmath49 is the sound speed ; and @xmath50 is the gas pressure .",
    "subscripts 1 and 2 correspond to the values in the regions ahead of and behind the shock front , respectively .",
    "taking into account a step - like change of the parameters , from equation ( [ eq1 ] ) we can obtain the relationship between distribution functions : @xmath51 the source term @xmath52 provides an injection of some fraction @xmath53 of particles crossing the shock front into the acceleration process , where @xmath54 is the upstream particle number density ; we call @xmath55 the injection rate . for the injection momentum , we use @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the numerical factor , @xmath58 is the ion mass , and @xmath59 is the sound speed behind the shock front .",
    "kinetic simulations suggest that for parallel shocks , a fraction of about @xmath60 of the particles crossing the shock is injected into the acceleration process with momentum @xmath61 @xcite . to fit the data by amplitude ( see figure [ f12 ] ) , in our calculations we use values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which are in good agreement with the results of the kinetic simulations .",
    "the source term determines the amplitude of the distribution function at the shock front for a given injection momentum : @xmath64 the diffusion coefficient is determined by the relation @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the particle speed , @xmath67 is the gyrofrequency , @xmath68 is the elementary charge , @xmath69 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath70 is the differential density of the alfven wave magnetic energy over the logarithm of the wave number @xmath71 .",
    "particles are scattered by alfven waves whose wave number of is the inverse gyroradius @xmath72 .    in our model , the cme and shock front are represented by segments of heliocentric spherical surfaces with different radii .",
    "however , lasco white - light observations show that the cme shape is not spherical .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration is much effective at the quasi - parallel part of the shock ( the magnetic field is radial ) , which corresponds to its central part . at the periphery of the cme ,",
    "the shock becomes quasi - perpendicular and acceleration is not effective ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "since particles are strongly magnetized ( @xmath73 ) , the assumption that the shock front is spherical does not affect particle acceleration .",
    "therefore , the heliocentric spherical surface segment of the shock in our model corresponds to the region of effective particle acceleration .",
    "for the spatial distribution of the proton number density in the solar atmosphere , we use the empirical model by @xcite : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "it is assumed that the solar corona density is determined only by protons : @xmath84 . to determine the plasma flow velocity , we apply the flow continuity condition @xmath85 , where @xmath86 km s@xmath4 , which corresponds to @xmath87  km  s@xmath4 , where @xmath88 is the astronomical unit .",
    "moreover , we use the isothermal atmosphere temperature of @xmath89 k and the spatial distribution of the radial magnetic field of @xmath90 , @xmath91 g @xcite .    the cme speed ( @xmath92 ) is determined from observations .",
    "the relation between cme and shock speeds is calculated from the linear case of the spherical symmetrical problem formulated in @xcite .",
    "the cme is represented as that moves with constant velocity from the initial time . during the piston movement in the medium , with a given density and plasma velocity ,",
    "the shock radius and velocity are determined by calculating the gas - dynamic equations . in figures",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] the calculation results for @xmath93 km s@xmath4 are shown .",
    "as we can see , the shock speed depends on the initial piston radius . at the beginning ,",
    "the shock speed rapidly increases and then remains almost constant .",
    "the ratio between the stable speeds can be presented as @xmath94 . for @xmath95 1 , 2 , 3 ,",
    "the corresponding values are @xmath96 2.6 , 1.7 , 1.5 .",
    "hereinafter , the values of @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath24 are given in @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows the temporary dependence of @xmath98 and @xmath24 for three initial cme radii .",
    "the flow velocity between @xmath98 and @xmath24 for all three cases is close to linear with the radius .",
    "the energy spectrum over frequency in the range @xmath99 may be expressed as @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 hz , and @xmath103 hz .",
    "it is expected that for @xmath104 the spectrum will be softer . in the calculations , we use kolmogorov s power - law index @xmath105 , the same as in the inertial part of the spectrum in interplanetary space @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath106 and the condition of particle resonance scattering @xmath107 results in @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",
    "we determine the diffusion coefficient from the spatial energy density of waves with @xmath111 , which provides the particle scatterings : @xmath112 $ ] and @xmath113 . here",
    "@xmath114 is the total energy density , which can be found from the ratio @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the energy flow density of waves moving from the sun , and @xmath117 is used . in the calculation , we use @xmath118 erg @xmath119s@xmath4 ) ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "hence , we get the expression for the particle diffusion coefficient @xmath120 where @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 , @xmath124 erg @xmath83 , and @xmath125 .    in our calculation",
    ", we take into account the particle diffusion along the magnetic field only , and , as mentioned above , we assume that @xmath126 . particle diffusion across the magnetic field is not considered because according to the results of the two - component ( 2d - slab ) turbulence theory in the inner heliosphere , @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "sep spectra generation in the solar corona mainly depends on the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the properties of the alfven turbulence spectrum used are , in fact , free parameters .",
    "they can be determined from the comparison of the model calculations to the observation results of seps .",
    "the dependences of the diffusion coefficient on energy for @xmath128 and on radius for various @xmath129 and @xmath130 are shown in figures [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , respectively .",
    "the formulated problem , equations ( [ eq1])([eq6 ] ) with edge conditions of @xmath131 , and @xmath132 has been solved numerically .",
    "the solution algorithm for the particle transport equation is similar to the one developed by @xcite to describe cosmic - ray acceleration in supernova remnants . for the alfven wave distribution with direction",
    ", we adopt @xmath133 , @xmath134 and thus @xmath135 in all calculation cases .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows the accelerated particle intensity of @xmath136 at the shock front , which depends on the kinetic energy , for three shock front radii of @xmath137 with the following parameters : @xmath128 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath93 km s@xmath4 , and @xmath141 .",
    "we assume that the above parameters are standard and will only mention if they differ in the sequel . in the energy range of @xmath142 , a region of power - law spectrum",
    "is formed , the index of which corresponds to the stationary spectrum of @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the power - law index of the particle spectrum accelerated by the plane shock front with @xmath145 .",
    "the characteristic value of @xmath146 limiting the power - law spectrum region is equal to the energy of particles whose time of cyclic movement in the vicinity of the shock front equals to the average time @xmath147 defined in the appendix , equation  [ eqa4 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath148 , indicated in figure [ f5 ] by downward arrows , changes in time , as in the acceleration by the plane shock front .",
    "the value of @xmath149 is defined by equation ( [ eqa9 ] ) , in the appendix .",
    "the decrease of the spectrum amplitude at the power - law spectrum region is caused by the spatial distribution of matter density in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the slight increase of injection energy is due to the increase of the shock speed ( the lowest curve in figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the cutoff region of the spectrum adjoins to the power region .",
    "the physical reason for the cutoff formation is the dispersion of the cyclic movement time relative to the average time @xmath147 .",
    "the spectrum shape in the cutoff region is an important parameter since high - energy seps form this region .",
    "the values of @xmath150 determine the width of the cutoff region and are marked by the upward arrows in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "values of @xmath151 are calculated according to equation ( [ eqa7 ] ) . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "the ratio @xmath152 does not depend on time .",
    "note that the ratio of @xmath153 calculated for the plane shock front exceeds the value from our calculation is approximately 10 times .",
    "the difference is apparently due to different geometry .",
    "we calculate the particle acceleration up to @xmath154 .",
    "then the acceleration becomes ineffective due to a geometrical factor .",
    "the influence of the shock front size on particle acceleration is taken into account through the modulation parameter @xmath155 .",
    "particles with @xmath156 intensively leave the vicinity of the shock front .",
    "it is the phenomenon of particle escaping which describes the injection of accelerated particles into the environment with monotonically changing parameters @xcite .",
    "the dependence of acceleration efficiency on the modulation parameter can be explained as follows : ( 1 ) the particles during cyclic movement move away from the shock front move away on a distance of the diffusive length @xmath157 , and ( 2 ) the acceleration efficiency depends on the ratio between @xmath158 and @xmath24 : if @xmath159 , particles return to the shock front and are accelerated ; if @xmath160 , particles may not return and their acceleration is suppressed . in figure [ f5 ]",
    "the thin curve shows the modulation parameter for @xmath154 .",
    "the parameter value scale is the same as on left axis of the figure .",
    "figure [ f6 ] presents the spatial distribution of particle intensity in relative units with @xmath161 mev for @xmath162 3.5 , 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "as we can see from figure [ f5 ] the particle intensity for this energy at @xmath163 has almost reached the stationary value .",
    "accordingly , its spatial distribution is similar to that of the stationary shape : the distribution is exponential ahead of the shock front , and an interval of constant value forms behind the shock front . in the subsequent expansion",
    ", the shape of the spatial distribution ahead of the shock front remains the same .",
    "the expansion of the volume filled with particles is caused by the increase of the diffusion coefficient at the shock front .",
    "the region of constant value behind the front increases with time .",
    "the left boundary of the intensity distribution behind the shock front coincides with the piston radius .",
    "the monotonic decrease of the intensity at the shock front at @xmath164 is caused by the decrease of the injection rate .    in figure",
    "[ f7 ] , the differential spectrum of the total number of accelerated particles is plotted as a function of kinetic energy , which is defined as @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the volume at @xmath167 per the unit of a solid angle @xmath168 . the curves in the figure correspond to the spectra of the total accelerated particle number ahead of and behind the shock front as well as their sum .",
    "the distribution depends on particle energy : there are more particles with energies of @xmath169 mev behind the shock front , and the opposite for particles with energies of @xmath170 mev",
    ".    figures [ f8 ] , and [ f9 ] show the particle intensities at the shock front as a function of energy for initial radii of @xmath171 1 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "one can see that the smaller @xmath172 is , the higher is @xmath173 ( see figure [ f1 ] ) , and the more efficient is the particle acceleration . from figures",
    "[ f2 ] , [ f5 ] , [ f8 ] , and [ f9 ] , one can conclude that the spectrum is formed 0.21 hr after the beginning of cme motion . at that time",

    "all calculations here start at @xmath176 and finish when @xmath154 .",
    "the intensities marked by digit 1 in figure [ f10 ] and digit 3 in figure [ f5 ] are calculated with standard parameters .",
    "curves 25 differ in one parameter : 2 is for @xmath177 , 3 is with @xmath178 erg @xmath83 , 4 is for @xmath179 ; and 5 is with @xmath180 km s@xmath4 .",
    "curve 6 represents the total influence of the changes .",
    "the particle acceleration rate in the regular acceleration depends on the value of @xmath181 and it can explain the intensity changes in figure [ f10 ] . here , the parameter @xmath182 is proportional to the sum of diffusion coefficients ahead of and behind the shock front .    in most cases",
    "sep flows are measured at the earth s orbit .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to somehow connect spectra of particles accelerated in the solar atmosphere and ones registered in interplanetary space .",
    "the cme itself also influences particle propagation in interplanetary space .",

    ", the cme only influences the particle spatial distribution .",
    "the second scenario describes particles with @xmath190 mev nucleon@xmath4 in observations and their constant flow value retains to cme arrival @xcite . in the third case",
    ", the cme does not affect particle propagation . in observations ,",

    "detailed dynamic and self - consistent models of the shock propagation and particle acceleration have been developed by @xcite for strong shock waves and by @xcite for shock waves with arbitrary intensities . using these models ,",
    "@xcite have invented a numerical method known as particle acceleration and transport in the heliosphere ( path ) to simulate sep events in interplanetary space .",
    "the model includes local particle injection at the moving quasi - parallel shock wave , diffusive shock acceleration , self - consistent alfven wave generation by accelerated particles , particle trapping and escape from the complex shock , and particle propagation in the inner heliosphere . using the path method ,",

    "apparently , the maximal energy in the spectrum agrees with the observations ; however , the cutoff shape significantly differs from the registered one .",

    "the corresponding particle transport equation for an isotropic distribution function @xmath229 is @xmath230 where the subscript @xmath231 can be 1 or 2 , corresponding to the regions ahead of @xmath232 and behind @xmath233 the shock front , respectively ; @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the spatial diffusion coefficients ; @xmath236 and @xmath237 are the flow velocity ahead of and behind the shock front ; @xmath238 is the compression ratio ; @xmath239 is the front position ; @xmath240 ; @xmath241 is the particle number density injecting at the momentum @xmath242 ; and @xmath243 is the heaviside function . in the case when the coefficients @xmath234 and @xmath235 are constants and relate to each other as @xmath244 , the task has an exact solution : @xmath245    @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the relative spectrum ; @xmath248 , with @xmath249 , is the stationary spectrum of accelerated particles at the shock front ; @xmath250 ; @xmath251 ; @xmath252 ; @xmath253 ; @xmath254 ; and @xmath255 is the additional probability integral . to derive the above expressions , the laplace transformation in time is used .",
    "the solution ( [ eqa1 ] ) at the shock front @xmath256 is similar to that obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "figure [ f14 ] shows the spatial distribution of the relative particle spectrum ( @xmath258 , @xmath259 ) whose momentum logarithm is 1 ( @xmath260 ) as a function of distance for five successive time moments .",
    "the deviations of the corresponding values of the numerical solution from the exact solution in percent are given at the top panels of the figures .",
    "one can see from figures [ f13 ] and [ f14 ] that the accuracy of the calculation depends on the amplitude of the relative spectrum .",
    "the relative deviation does not exceed a few percent if the value is higher than @xmath261 .",
    "in general , the comparison confirms the sufficient accuracy of the numerical calculation algorithm .    the exact solution ( [ eqa1 ] ) describes the formation of the accelerated particle spectrum in time .",
    "the shape of the spectrum depends on the momentum .",
    "the shape is mainly determined by the first term in equation ( [ eqa1 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath262 , which separates different shapes of the spectrum , can be found from ( [ eqa1 ] ) by equating the argument of the first additional probability integral to zero .",

    "the temporary dynamics of the spatial distribution , shown in figure [ f14 ] , is the same for all momenta , differing by the offset .",
    "figures [ f13 ] and [ f14 ] show that the spatial distribution in the region ahead of the shock front becomes exponential , with an interval of constant value being formed in the region behind the shock front .",
    "the subsequent changes in the spatial distribution are only an expansion of the interval .",
    "let us consider the approximate solution of the problem of particle acceleration by the plane shock front when the diffusion coefficients depend on momentum .",
    "such a solution can be used to interpret the particle spectrum dependence on task parameters .",
    "it is known that the acceleration of particles by the regular mechanism is caused by the cyclic particle movement in the vicinity of the shock front @xcite .",
    "statistical characteristics of the movement , such as the average time of @xmath272 that particles spend on @xmath71 cycles , and the corresponding dispersion is @xmath273 , are as follows @xcite : @xmath274 from the comparison of @xmath272 from equation ( [ eqa4 ] ) for @xmath275 with its counterpart from equation ( [ eqa2 ] ) , we get @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",

    "the values of @xmath285 and @xmath271 from equation ( [ eqa5 ] ) are obtained the same way as in equation ( [ eqa1 ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath286 where @xmath287 , @xmath288^{0.5}}a$ ] .    in the case of spatial dependence of the diffusion coefficients on radius",

    "we represent the parameters by @xmath295 , @xmath296 , where @xmath297 is the diffusion coefficient ahead of the shock front , @xmath298 is the counterpart behind the shock front ; @xmath299 is the spatial scale ; and @xmath300 is the shock radius depending on time . in this case",
    "the diffusion coefficient at the shock front is @xmath301 , where @xmath302 . substituting it into equation ( [ eqa8 ] ) and dividing the variables",
