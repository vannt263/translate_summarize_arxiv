    "until about a decade ago , the age of the oldest globular cluster ( gc ) was of widespread interest because it provided one of the best available constraints on the age of the universe and thereby on the cosmological model used to describe it ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as it has turned out , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , taken with the wmap and planck satellites have since yielded what appears to be a robust , and very precise , estimate of the age of the universe ( 13.8 gyr , with an uncertainty of @xmath13 gyr , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "( this is the age predicted by the flat @xmath14cdm model that accurately reproduces the observed temperature power spectrum of the cmb . ) however , absolute ( and relative ) gc ages are no less important today than they were prior to the cmb results . in particular , they are needed to test and constrain models for the origin of gcs over the entire metallicity range spanned by them and to provide some insights into the formation and early evolution of galaxies .",
    "for instance , in their extensive review , @xcite argued that the most metal - poor gcs formed in low - mass dark matter halos in the early universe ( at redshifts @xmath15 ) , whereas metal - rich systems were created during the subsequent mergers of gas - rich structures that built up the parent galaxies . in a later study ,",
    "@xcite used @xmath16-body simulations combined with semi - analytic treatments of the main processes that govern galaxy and gc formation ( e.g. , merging , star formation , supernova feedback , radiative gas cooling ) to predict that @xmath17% of gcs formed in low - mass galaxies at @xmath18 and that the mean ages of clusters that have [ fe / h ] @xmath19 are @xmath20 gyr older than more metal - rich systems .",
    "more recently , @xcite pointed out that dwarf star - forming ( lyman-@xmath21 emitting ) galaxies at intermediate to high redshift have the right size , metallicity , luminosity , and star formation rate to be a natural site for the formation of metal - poor gcs .",
    "they suggest that  low metallicities are not the exclusive result of an earlier birth time compared to metal - rich disk and bulge gcs , but rather the result of a lower mass host , considering the ( observed ) mass - metallicity relation in galaxies \" . in other words ,",
    "metal - poor globular clusters could simply be those systems that happened to form in dwarf galaxies of low metallicity at whatever time the birth event occurred .",
    "even from these few examples , it is clear that the proposed formation scenarios make different predictions for the age of the oldest gc , the dispersion in age at a fixed iron abundance ( perhaps especially at the lowest metallicities ) , and the variation in age with [ fe / h ] and galactocentric distance .",
    "unfortunately , despite the efforts made by many researchers over the past @xmath22 years , it has not yet been possible to firmly establish the absolute , or the relative , ages of the galactic gcs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "this is apparent even if one considers only those papers that were published after 2008 .",
    "for example , ages as young as 11 gyr ( @xcite ) or as old as 13.5 gyr ( @xcite ) have been derived for m@xmath1092 , which has [ fe / h ] @xmath23 ( ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cbg09 ) ) .",
    "( these seemingly discrepant results are , in fact , due mostly to differences in the adopted distance . ) in addition , from an analysis of homogeneous _ hst _",
    "photometry for 64 gcs , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mf09 ) found that the majority of the clusters with [ @xmath24/h ] @xmath25 are coeval ( to within the uncertainties ) with the most metal - deficient systems .",
    "however , there are reasons to be concerned with this finding , especially after considering recent estimates of the age of 47 tucanae .",
    "on the one hand , mf09 obtained a normalized age ( @xmath26 absolute cluster age divided by the mean age of gcs that have [ fe / h ] @xmath27 ) of @xmath28 for 47 tuc ( which has [ fe / h ] @xmath29 on the metallicity scale by @xcite ) , as compared with values of @xmath30 for m@xmath1015 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 for m@xmath1092 ( @xmath33 ) , when ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dsep ) isochrones are used in the analysis . in a follow - up study of the same photometry , @xcite derived ages of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 gyr for 47 tuc , m@xmath1015 , and m@xmath1092 , respectively , using an isochrone - fitting procedure that permitted small adjustments to the distances , reddenings , and metallicities from initial estimates of these quantities given in the 2003 revision of the @xcite catalog .",
    "in fact , the cluster parameters adopted by mf09 and dotter et al .",
    "are sometimes quite different ; e.g. , the latter assumed [ fe / h ] @xmath37 for both m@xmath1015 and m@xmath1092 , as well as lower values of [ @xmath21/fe ] .",
    "moreover , the observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) are not reproduced very well by dsep isochrones at low metallicities ; see figs .  4 and 5 in the dotter et al .",
    "paper , which show , in turn , that the fiducial sequences of ngc@xmath103201 and ngc@xmath107099 ( m@xmath1030 ) , from just below the turnoff ( to ) to the lower red - giant branch ( rgb ) , cross over isochrones spanning about a 3 gyr range in age . of particular concern",
    "is the fact that the observed tos are significantly redder than those of the isochrones in the adopted fits , as this has the effect of making the inferred age somewhat too large ( see the discussion in   [ subsec : m5 ] below ) .",
    "if the same difficulties were found for m@xmath1015 and m@xmath1092 , which is expected to be the case since their cmds in the vicinity of the turnoff are morphologically indistinguishable from that of m@xmath1030 ( see vandenberg 2000 , his fig .",
    "2 ) , then the ages derived by dotter et al .  for all three clusters should be reduced to @xmath38 gyr , which is identical to their estimate of the age of 47 tuc . [ although dotter et al .",
    "( 2010 ) do not actually show how well their computations match the cmd of 47 tuc , their fig .",
    "3 demonstrates that dsep isochrones for [ fe / h ] @xmath39 faithfully reproduce the cmd of ngc@xmath106362 , which suggests that these models are not problematic in the metal - rich regime .",
    "it is regrettable that dotter et al .",
    "provided such plots for only three gcs , as it would have been helpful to see how well their models fare for more of the most metal - deficient systems as well as those at the highest metallicities . ]    on the other hand , using the same dsep isochrones , @xcite derived an age of @xmath40 ( random ) @xmath41 ( systematic ) gyr for 47 tuc on the assumption of [ fe / h ] @xmath42 , [ @xmath21/fe ] @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and an apparent distance modulus , @xmath45 , which is based on the properties of the eclipsing binary member known as v69 .",
    "this compares quite favorably with the determination of 11.0 gyr by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , if @xmath46 and similar chemical abundances are assumed , in an investigation that also reported an age of 13.5 gyr for m@xmath1092 . because the distance moduli adopted by vandenberg et al .",
    "are within 0.05 mag of those implied by fits of computed zero - age horizontal - branch ( zahb ) loci to the lower bound of the distributions of cluster hb stars performed by vandenberg ( 2000 ) , it is not a surprise that both studies found 47 tuc to be about 2.5 gyr younger than m@xmath1092 .",
    "in fact , notwithstanding small differences in the adopted cluster properties , the binary- and zahb - based distance moduli for 47 tuc agree very well with the value of @xmath47 that was obtained by @xcite from fits of the cluster main - sequence ( ms ) to nearby subdwarfs having similar metal abundances and well - determined trigonometric parallaxes from _ hipparcos _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , these results , coupled with the fact that high ages ( @xmath48 gyr ) are obtained for m@xmath1092 when its distance is similarly derived either from fits to local subdwarfs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 2 ) ) or from the luminosity of its hb stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) ) , appear to rule out a common age for 47 tuc and the most metal - deficient gcs . at the very least , they call into question the findings of mf09 and dotter et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "the present investigation has been undertaken mainly to study and to try to resolve the discrepancies discussed above concerning relative gc ages .",
    "however , we have also taken this opportunity to derive the absolute ages of most of the clusters considered by mf09 on the assumption of zahb - based distances .",
    "  [ sec : input ] briefly discusses the photometric data and the stellar evolutionary models that have been used , while   [",

    "( it will become evident in the next section that , because the models are forced to match the turnoff color in order to derive the correct estimate of the cluster age for the assumed distance and metallicity , uncertainties associated with the adopted value of @xmath57 or with the relation between @xmath59 and @xmath57 are of no consequence for the age that is obtained . )",
    "as far as the stellar models are concerned ,",

    "also see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter , which apply to castelli - kurucz model atmospheres , were corrected by amounts ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 mag , depending on the metallicity , in order to ensure that there is good continuity of the bc values over the entire temperature range that encompasses the stellar models .",

    "[ subsec : m5 ] and   [ sec : ages ] , they generally provide rather good fits to the hb populations of gcs that are nearly unreddened , when the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) @xmath57 values are assumed ; i.e. , there is no compelling evidence that the predicted colors should be further corrected in any way .",
    "when comparing isochrones and zahb loci with observed cmds , we have assumed the [ fe / h ] values given by cbg09 for the gcs in our sample , along with [ @xmath21/fe ] @xmath71 at [ fe / h ] @xmath72 ( approximately the metallicity where the [ o / fe ] and [ @xmath21/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] relations for field halo stars change slope ; e.g. , @xcite ) . at higher iron abundances , [ @xmath21/fe ] has been assumed to decline linearly with [ fe / h ] in order to reach a value of 0.0 at [ fe / h ] @xmath73 .",
    "we have also adopted @xmath74 at [ fe / h ] @xmath75 , in good agreement with the primordial helium abundance ( @xmath76 , ( * ? ? ?",

    "approximately this value of the helium enrichment parameter is obtained if @xmath79 varies from 0.2485 at @xmath80 to the initial @xmath81 values which are typically assumed in standard solar models ( ssms ) that take diffusive processes into account ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . and @xmath82 for the initial helium and metals mass - fraction abundances , as well as @xmath83 for the usual mixing - length parameter .",
    "this model implies @xmath84 . ] in this way , the values of [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath21/fe ] , and @xmath79 specific to each gc have been set .",
    "isochrones for the same values of these chemical abundance parameters were then obtained by interpolating within the many grids of evolutionary tracks provided by vbd12 , using the code described by them .",
    "the parameter @xmath85  was originally ( @xcite , @xcite ) used to represent the difference in magnitude between the ms turnoff and the hb , measured at the color of the to .",
    "however , it was appreciated early on that , since a cluster fiducial is vertical at the to ( by definition ) as well as a slowly varying function of color over a fairly large range in magnitude above and below this point , the turnoff luminosity and its variation with age can not be determined to very high precision . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", @xcite suggested that @xmath85  be measured at a point that is brighter and slightly redder than the turnoff ( by 0.05 mag ) as this would involve a much smaller uncertainty .",
    "the other well - known difficulty with the @xmath85 technique for measuring cluster ages is that , in many gcs , the horizontal part of the hb is not populated ; i.e. , the core he - burning stars are located either well to the blue of the instability strip or close to the rgb in a  red clump \" .",
    "however , in such cases , theoretical zahb loci may be used to extrapolate from the observed distributions of hb stars to the color where @xmath85  is evaluated , especially if the same models perform well when applied to clusters of similar metallicity in which their hb populations have colors that overlap those of their to and subgiant ( sgb ) stars .",
    "alternatively , a different method should be used to determine the relative ages of gcs , such as a calibration of the difference in color between the msto and the rgb in terms of age according to the prescription described in the pioneering study by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "our implementation of the @xmath85  method is more implicit than those versions described above .",
    "no attempt is made to determine the luminosity of the hb at a particular color .",
    "rather , a theoretical zahb for the appropriate chemical abundances is fitted to the lower bound of the observed distribution of hb stars ( since core he - burning stars are predicted to evolve to higher luminosities as they age ) , after the observed colors have been dereddened , to determine the apparent distance modulus . once the absolute magnitude scale has been set in this way ,",
    "there is only one isochrone for the assumed metallicity that will provide a simultaneous match to the observed turnoff color and the beginning of the cluster sgb . to identify it ,",
    "isochrones for different ages must each be shifted horizontally in color by whatever amount , if any , is required to reproduce the observed turnoff color when they are overlaid onto the photometric data .",
    "if a given isochrone is too young or too old , its sgb segment will be too bright or too faint , respectively , relative to the observed stars . by iterating on the age ,",
    "the best - fit isochrone can be readily determined .",
    "the same thing can be accomplished by first shifting all of the isochrones for an appropriate range in age to a common to color ( specifically , to the observed turnoff color ) , and then overlaying the resultant grid onto the cluster cmd .",
    "as before , the age of the cluster is equated to the age of the isochrone that provides the best superposition of the subgiant stars just past the to .",
    "it should be appreciated that the color adjustments which are applied to the models do not affect the predicted age - luminosity relations for any point along the isochrones ( e.g. , at the turnoff or at the location on the sgb that is 0.05 mag redder than the to ) .",
    "these offsets are needed because , in general , the predicted and observed color scales will not be in perfect agreement due to , for instance , errors in the color@xmath65  relations , uncertainties in the treatment of some of the stellar physics ingredients ( e.g. , superadiabatic convection , surface boundary conditions ) , or incorrect assumptions regarding the cluster properties ( reddening , distance , metallicity ) . only by matching the predicted and observed tos",
    "are we are able to reliably ascertain which isochrone provides the best fit to an observed cmd in the vicinity of the to , including the turnoff luminosity .",
    "the main difference between our approach and that advocated by chaboyer et al .  ( 1996 ) is that we fit isochrones directly to the observed distributions of stars that have colors within approximately 0.05 mag of the turnoff  especially brighter than the to , but also below it  instead of relying on just two points ( i.e. , the to color and the selected sgb fiducial point ) to infer an age . in the case of the chaboyer et al .",
    "technique , one has no idea how well the isochrones are able to match the morphology of the observed cmd , though it is implicitly assumed that they do .",
    "in fact , as shown below , modern stellar models that take diffusive processes into account do reproduce the shapes of gc cmds in the vicinity of the turnoff very well . as a consequence , essentially identical ages",
    "would be obtained using either the method that we have employed or that described by chaboyer et al .",
    "to better appreciate the reasons for , and the advantages of , comparing isochrones with observations in the particular way that we have described , it is helpful to consider several plots , beginning with figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this illustrates the appearance on the [ @xmath86-plane of a representative set of isochrones ; in this case , for [ fe / h ] @xmath87 ( roughly the mean metallicity of the galactic gcs ) , [ @xmath21/fe ] @xmath71 , @xmath88 , and ages of 10 to 13 gyr , in 0.5 gyr increments . due to the use of the state - of - the - art interpolation code developed by p.  bergbusch ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , as well as the latest updates reported by vbd12 ) ) , and to the well - behaved derivatives of @xmath89 and @xmath90 with respect to time along the computed evolutionary tracks , the isochrones have especially smooth morphologies .    in the upper left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ,",
    "the 10 gyr isochrone from the previous figure has been replotted so that the abscissa gives the color relative to the turnoff color and the ordinate specifies the magnitude with respect to a point on the upper ms that is 0.05 mag redder than the to .",
    "isochrones for all of the other ages were then superimposed in such a way that , after registering them to the same abscissa and ordinate zero points , additional ( small ) vertical shifts were applied , if needed , in order to minimize the differences in their magnitudes at the aforementioned color offset both above _ and _ below the to .",
    "it is clear that , as the result of this centering procedure , which yielded the @xmath91 information provided in the legend , all of the isochrones have essentially identical turnoff luminosities .",
    "thus , we have determined , for instance , that the turnoff luminosities of 10.5 and 13.0 gyr isochrones are , respectively , 0.051 mag and 0.263 mag fainter than that of the 10.0 gyr isochrone .",
    "these numbers are very precise , with uncertainties at the level of @xmath92 mag .",
    "however , we do not need , or use , these numerical results in our age - dating technique .",
    "what is important is that we have demonstrated that the shapes of isochrones within 0.05 mag of the to are essentially independent of age ; consequently , there is no basis for preferring one isochrone over another ( in a given grid ) from a morphological perspective when they are restricted to comparisons with observed cmds in the vicinity of the turnoff .",
    "the bottom left - hand panel shows that this conclusion holds for other metallicities .",
    "we realized , after creating the upper left - hand panel of fig .  2 , that we could easily evaluate the errors associated with the mf09  relative main - sequence fitting \" ( rmsf ) method , at a fixed metallicity , through further manipulations of the isochrones . beginning with the grid",
    "as plotted in that panel , all of the older isochrones were shifted horizontally to the red until their rgb segments overlaid that of the 10 gyr isochrone  resulting in the middle panel ( top row ) . from this starting point",
    ", it is easy to achieve a simultaneous coincidence of the rgb and lower ms segments of all of the isochrones , which is the essence of the mf09 approach , by simply shifting them along a line that is parallel to the giant branch .",
    "this can be easily accomplished if a horizontal line is drawn in the middle panel at , say , an ordinate value of 1.0 and the difference in color between any two isochrones is evaluated from their intersection with that line .",
    "a triangle can then be defined in which this color difference is the length of one of its sides and the angles at each vertex may be determined from fact that the other two sides have slopes equal to those of the ms and the rgb .",
    "this is sufficient information that , with the aid of simple trigonometry , the small horizontal and vertical shifts that are needed to obtain the results shown in the upper right - hand panel are easily calculated .",
    "( the plots in the bottom row present similar results for isochrones computed on the assumption of [ fe / h ] @xmath37 . )",
    "the legends in the right - hand panels for both metallicities list the adjustments in @xmath93 so derived .",
    "these are the differences in the turnoff luminosities , relative to that of the youngest isochrone in each grid , that are obtained when isochrones are aligned according to the mf09 formalism .",
    "( note that these results would be more uncertain if we had attempted to determine the to luminosities explicitly , instead of employing our indirect , but more accurate and precise method . )",
    "interestingly , they agree quite well with the results reported in the legends of the left - hand panels ( particularly at the lowest [ fe / h ] value ) ; and , as expected , the former are somewhat less than the latter . some compression of the range of to luminosities for the same age range can be expected because , as readily appreciated by considering fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] , it is necesssary to move the older isochrones upwards and to the left , in a direction parallel to the lower ms , in order to force their giant branches to match the rgb of the youngest isochrone without causing any separation of their respective lower main sequences . the errors , which are small compared with other sources of uncertainty , arise simply because the location of the rgb is not independent of age , though the dependence is quite weak ( as noted by mf09 ) . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] provides encouraging support for the rmsf method , at least when applied to gcs having similar metal abundances , which implies that any problems with the mf09 study must arise in the connection of their results for the different metallicity groups .",
    "this is fully discussed in   [ subsubsec : mf09 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] is similar to the left - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] except that isochrones for the same age ( 12 gyr ) , helium content , and @xmath21-element abundances , but different [ fe / h ] values ( @xmath94 [ fe / h ] @xmath95 , in 0.2 dex increments ) are considered .",
    "the thinness of the line at the turnoff , as well as slightly above and below it , indicate that all of the isochrones have exactly the same to luminosities as a result of the color and magnitude adjustments that have been applied .",
    "( the table contained within the plot lists the differences in the to magnitudes between the more metal - rich isochrones and that for [ fe / h ] @xmath96 .",
    "we see from a comparison of these results with those given in the left - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] that the effect on the turnoff luminosity of varying the metallicity by 0.2 dex is slightly larger than the impact of varying the age by 0.5 gyr . )",
    "although the remaining parts of the isochrones that lay within the region enclosed by the dashed rectangle are not quite as  perfectly \" coincident as they are at the to , the models span a much larger range in metallicity than one would normally consider when comparing isochrones with the cmd of a given cluster .",
    "most would agree that the [ fe / h ] values of the majority of gcs are known to within @xmath970.2 dex ( compare , e.g. , the [ fe / h ] determinations for clusters in common to the studies by @xcite , @xcite , and cbg09 ) , and had we restricted fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] to a plot of isochrones that span a range in [ fe / h ] of only 0.20.3 dex , a noticeable reduction in the morphological variations near the to would have been apparent .",
    "be that as it may , the main conclusion to be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] is that the shapes of isochrones ( for a given heavy - element mixture ) within @xmath98 mag of the turnoff are predicted to be _ nearly _ independent of [ fe / h ] , at least at values of @xmath99 and less .    at higher metallicities ,",
    "the opacities in stellar interiors become larger at an increasingly rapid rate , which impacts the predicted mass - luminosity relations ( i.e. , the turnoff mass at a fixed age ) to an ever greater extent . as a result of the latter ,",
    "the subgiant branch of , say , a 12 gyr isochrone becomes noticeably flatter as the [ fe / h ] value increases above @xmath100 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "( the drop in sgb luminosities occurs because it takes more energy to expand the envelope of a more massive star as it evolves towards the rgb . )",
    "interestingly , when measured at the same luminosity offset from the turnoff , the msto - to - rgb color difference at a fixed age is predicted to have no more than a slight dependence on metal abundance at [ fe / h ] @xmath101 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] , the near invariance of the morphology of the turnoff portions of isochrones for high ages is also found when @xmath79 , [ @xmath21/fe ] , and even the value of the mixing - length parameter , @xmath102 , are varied . except for the beginning of the sgb ( the part inside the dashed rectangle ) , the shapes of isochrones for post - to phases , as well as the location of the rgb relative to the turnoff , clearly depend quite sensitively on these parameters ( as well as on age and [ fe / h ] ) . as a result",
    ", one should not be concerned if the isochrone that is fitted to the turnoff observations fails to reproduce the location of the giant branch : there are too many uncertainties that affect the predicted @xmath65  and color scales to expect perfect consistency . the only models that we have found which are appreciably offset from the others within the region enclosed by the dashed rectangle are those that neglect diffusive processes ( as represented by the _ long - dashed curve _ ) , though the differences are still quite small . however , helioseismic studies established the importance of this physics many years ago ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the main point of figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ,  [ fig : fig3 ] , and  [ fig : fig5 ] is that parameter variations appear to have little or no impact on the shapes of isochrones near the turnoff ( at least for ages @xmath10311 gyr ) , and hence that our isochrone - fitting procedure has a solid footing .",
    "small differences are , in any case , neither observationally detectable nor of significant importance for the inferred ages .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the same conclusions would have been reached had the isochrones been plotted on the @xmath104 or @xmath105 diagrams .",
    "for instance , the superpositions of the various loci in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] look no different from those shown in the left - hand panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] . the same thing will likely be found when other photometric systems and filter bandpasses are used because the total range in @xmath65  spanned by @xmath10613 gyr between the to and the beginning of the sgb is quite small .",
    "however , this is something that will need to be checked on a case - by - case basis : it is beyond the scope of this study to do so here .",
    "similarly , our results should not be extrapolated to ages outside the ranges that we have considered .",
    "had we included isochrones for younger ages in the aforementioned plots , some deviations between them and the older isochrones in the vicinity of the turnoff would have been evident .",
    "our results have been restricted to the age ranges that are relevant to the gcs in our sample .      in the case of a well - defined cmd , our implementation of the @xmath85  method will provide a highly precise age , whose accuracy depends almost entirely on the adopted distance and chemical abundances .",
    "so - called  fitting errors \" are not of significant importance .",
    "consider , for example , the cmd of m@xmath105 ( ngc@xmath105904 ) from the @xcite database that is shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] for the region within @xmath107 mag of the turnoff .",
    "from least - squares fits to the median points that are derived after the photometry has been sorted into 0.10 mag bins , the observed turnoff color is found to be 0.4738 .",
    "( as long as this number has been determined to better than @xmath108 mag , which is appreciably larger than its uncertainty , the age that is found from an overlay of isochrones onto the turnoff photometry is not significantly affected ; see below . )",
    "to place the data on the [ @xmath109-plane , we have assumed the indicated reddening and an apparent distance modulus of 14.38 , which is based on the fit of a zahb to the cluster counterpart ( to be discussed shortly ) .    to determine the age of m@xmath105 , isochrones for @xmath88 , [ fe / h",
    "] @xmath110 ( cbg09 ) , and enhanced @xmath21-element abundances ( see   [ sec : input ] ) were generated for ages from 10.5 to 12.5 gyr , in steps of 0.25 gyr , once preliminary fits had narrowed the age range .",
    "each isochrone was then shifted horizontally , in turn , by whatever amount was needed in order for the predicted and observed turnoff colors to match , until the one was found that provided the best fit to the beginning part of the sgb ( the stars within the dotted rectangle brighter than @xmath111 ) . just by inspection , it is obvious that an isochrone for 11.5 gyr ( the solid curve ) reproduces the mean stellar distribution in the vicinity of the to very well and that isochrones for ages which differ by @xmath112 gyr or @xmath113 gyr ( the dashed curves ) do not .",
    "the  fitting \" error , which appears to be at the level of @xmath114 gyr , is a small fraction of the total uncertainty associated with the derived age given that , in particular , a change of @xmath115 mag in the assumed distance modulus would result in an age that differs by about @xmath113 gyr ( see the tabular results in the right - hand panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , varying the adopted abundances of helium or oxygen would affect the age at a given turnoff luminosity by a small or a large amount , depending on the size of the variation ; see vbd12 .",
    "for instance , a change in the oxygen abundance by a factor of two would alter the inferred age by @xmath116 gyr .",
    "fortunately , the other heavy elements are much less important for predicted to luminosity versus age relations ( see vbd12 ) , though they do have some impact on zahb - based distance determinations . in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig8 ] , a zahb for the same chemical abundances that were assumed in the previous figure has been fitted to the lower bound of the distribution of hb stars in m@xmath105 , yielding @xmath117 . as shown in the right - hand panel , an equally good fit to the cluster hb",
    "is obtained on the assumption of an apparent modulus of 14.34 and [ fe / h ] @xmath118 ( instead of @xmath119 ) , with the values of @xmath79 and [ @xmath21/fe ] left unchanged .",
    "the ages that are obtained by matching the corresponding isochrones onto the to observations differ by only 0.25 gyr .",
    "thus , a 0.15 dex change in the adopted [ fe / h ] value does not have major consequences for the derived age , though ( of course ) the _ actual _ distance and reddening of m@xmath105 must be known in order to determine the true age of this system .",
    "however , this is not a concern for _ relative _ gc ages .",
    "in fact , it is a further advantage of using the @xmath85  method to determine cluster - to - cluster variations in age that the inferred ages have a reduced dependence on the adopted metal abundance  because both the hb and the to , at a fixed age , become fainter as the [ fe / h ] value increases , albeit not at exactly the same rate . on the other hand , as shown in our analysis of the m@xmath1013 cmd in   [ subsubsec : m3m13 ] , @xmath85  ages are highly sensitive to the assumed helium content given that the luminosity of the hb is predicted to be a strong function of @xmath79 .",
    "as in the case of m@xmath105 , we have found that the best - fit isochrones generally need to be offset to the blue by 0.010.025 mag ( see   [ sec : ages ] ) in order to reproduce the observed turnoff colors , even though our zahbs appear to be able to match the cluster hbs without such color adjustments . indeed , throughout this investigation , the @xmath120(color ) values that are specified in plots similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] have been applied only to the isochrones , not to the zahb loci .",
    "( this practice will have little , or no , impact on our results because our distance determinations are based primarily on the nearly horizontal part of a zahb .",
    "if small color offsets were applied to our zahb models , they would have noticeable consequences only at the blue end . ) the cause of such discrepancies is not known , though one can speculate that , among other possible explanations , the assumed [ fe / h ] or [ o / fe ] values are slightly too high , the gravity and/or temperature dependencies of the adopted color transformations are not quite right , or there are minor problems with , say , the treatment of the diffusion and extra - mixing physics or of the atmospheric boundary condition .. thus , we have good reason to suspect that the treatment of the atmosphere is mainly responsible for this difficulty .",
    "] however , a resolution of this matter is not needed here because discrepancies between the predicted and observed turnoff colors do not affect the derived @xmath85  ages , _ provided _ that the isochrones are corrected for them when the age is evaluated .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] .",
    "the middle panel is equivalent to fig .  7 , except that isochrones for the same chemical abundances have been plotted for ages of 10 to 13 gyr , in steps of 1 gyr , have not been shifted in the horizontal direction to a common to color",

    "have arbitarily been shifted by 0.015 mag to the red and to the blue , respectively , to force a mismatch between theory and observations .",
    "indeed , if we had not shifted our isochrones by 0.025 mag to the blue ( middle panel ) , their superposition onto the cluster cmd would have looked similar to that shown in the left - hand panel , but appearing even more discrepant . on the other hand ,",
    "the case shown in the right - hand panel bears considerable similarity to the fits of isochrones to the ngc@xmath103201 and m@xmath1030 cmds that were reported by dotter et al .",
    "regardless of how well the models reproduce the colors of real stars , these sorts of discrepancies could easily arise if , for instance , the assumed reddenings are wrong .",
    "it is clearly much more difficult to derive the age of m@xmath105 if the isochrones do not fit the ms and to observations . whereas an age near 11 gyr seems to be indicated by the overlay of the models onto the observed sgb in the left - hand panel , a significantly higher age ( at least 12 gyr )",
    "would be favored by the comparison shown in the right - hand panel .",
    "these estimates differ from the correct age ( for the assumed distance and chemical abundances ) by about 0.5 gyr .",
    "the reason why isochrones are compared with observed cmds is to determine which one provides the optimum match to the locus of stars from just below the turnoff to the beginning of the sgb , as this isochrone is presumably the one that best reproduces the observed turnoff luminosity .",
    "this can be evaluated only if each isochrone that is considered is first adjusted in color , if necessary , so that the predicted and observed to colors agree .",
    "the fact that dotter et al .",
    "( 2010 ) failed to do this in the case of ngc@xmath103201 and m@xmath1030 is the reason why the ages that they determined for these gcs ( and possibly other metal - deficient clusters ) are too high for the assumed distances by @xmath121 gyr , judging from the results presented in fig .",

    "however , before considering those clusters with the most easily fitted hb populations , it is important to show that the luminosities of our zahbs are in satisfactory agreement with observational constraints , as this implies that the derived distance moduli ( and hence ages ) are reasonably accurate in an absolute sense .",

    "this apparent inconsistency has yet to be resolved , though it may indicate , for instance , that gc metallicities , which are based primarily on bright giants , are not on precisely the same scale as those of the nearby field halo dwarfs , that there are some important differences in the chemical abundances of cluster and field stars of similar [ fe / h ] , or @xmath160",

    "it is a concern that the @xmath120(color ) offsets , which are needed for the best - fit isochrones to match the observed turnoffs , vary as much as they do ( from @xmath181 to @xmath182 ) , but what this means is not clear .",
    "it is possible that the variations in @xmath120(color ) arise from errors in the adopted [ fe / h ] values .",

    "however , if the higher distance modulus is more accurate , then all of the stars near the red end of the densest part of the hb population in ngc@xmath105286 would lie well above the zahb ; i.e. , they would all have to be evolved stars .",
    "this seems less likely than in the adopted fit , wherein the faintest of these stars are adjacent to the zahb , simply because there are so many stars in this group : the densest concentration of hb stars should be near the zahb where the evolutionary timescales are the longest .",
    "regardless of which variation of the @xmath85  method is implemented , the ages that are inferred for some gcs will depend on the assumption that is made concerning the evolutionary state of the hb stars that are observed .",

    "as indicated , the models assume [ fe / h ] @xmath195 and an initial helium abundance corresponding to @xmath203 .",
    "moreover , with these choices for the cluster properties , the age of 47 tuc is predicted to be 11.75 gyr .",
    "we decided to adopt an independent estimate of the 47 tuc distance because there is some ambiguity in how a zahb should be compared with the type of hb morphology that is characteristic of metal - rich systems .",
    "previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggested that the slightly sloped line which defines the lower boundary of the faintest hb stars in 47 tuc does not coincide with the observed zahb , but rather that the latter is located along the upturn that is predicted to occur near the red end .",
    "the same thing is indicated by the particular comparison that is shown in fig .  [ fig : fig14 ] . according to these results , stars arriving on the hb after undergoing the helium flash",
    "populate only that part of a zahb between its red end and the short horizontal line just below it , which has been drawn at the minimum luminosity of the observed hb clump .",
    "because masses tend to  pile up \" when a zahb approaches its minimum @xmath65  ( maximum color ) , before bending back to the blue , the mass range in this small region of the zahb is considerable . to be specific ,",
    "the reddest zahb model that has been plotted has a mass which is consistent with the neglect of mass loss over the preceding evolution , while the point that is defined by the intersection of the short horizontal line with the zahb has a lower mass by @xmath204 .",
    "( the ranges in luminosity and color encompassed by the entire hb population must therefore be a reflection of the tracks that are followed during post - zahb evolution ; see the paper by dorman et al .",
    "thus , differences in the adopted distance have implications for the inferred mass loss that occurred in the stars prior to reaching the zahb .",
    "it is clearly fortuitous that the zahb for the adopted abundances provides such a good fit to the observations , given all of the parameters at play .",
    "in fact , the models that have been used to fit the cmd of 47 tuc do not reproduce the properties of the binary ( v69 ) as well as one would like .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig15 ] plots the components of v69 on the mass  radius plane , together with the predicted variations of radius with mass along isochrones for ages that vary in 0.5 gyr increments from 10.0 to 12.0 gyr in some panels , or from 10.5 gyr to 12.5 gyr in others ( as specified just above the abscissa of each panel ) .",
    "the upper left - hand panel contains the isochrones from the previous figure : they favor an age of @xmath205 gyr for v69 ( and hence 47 tucanae ) , which is 0.75 gyr less than the age that was derived from the turnoff photometry .",
    "the other panels illustrate the impact of varying each of the chemical abundance parameters in turn .",
    "higher ages by about 0.5 gyr are obtained if @xmath79 is reduced by 0.005 or if the assumed [ fe / h ] value is increased by 0.06 dex .",
    "although not shown , the implication of the lower left - hand panel is that a higher age ( by about the same amount ) would also be the result of increasing [ @xmath21/fe ] by 0.11 dex .",
    "whether or not 47 tuc stars have such large enhancements of the @xmath21-elements is presently uncertain . whereas @xcite obtained [ mg / fe ] @xmath206 and [ si / fe ] @xmath207 from their spectroscopic survey of about 100 cluster giants , @xcite derived [ mg / fe ] @xmath208 and [ si / fe ] @xmath209 from a similar investigation of 110 hb stars . for the initial oxygen abundance ,",
    "the situation is further complicated by the o  na anticorrelation , though we suspect that the best estimate is close to the upper end of the observed range . in the investigation by carretta",
    ", the mean and upper envelope [ o / fe ] values for their sample of stars are 0.26 and @xmath210 , respectively",
    ". a much higher average value of [ o / fe ] ( @xmath211 ) was derived @xcite from 8 rgb stars that have @xmath212 [ o / fe ] @xmath213 .",
    "these determinations may be compared with [ o / fe ] @xmath214 in thick - disk field stars that have [ fe / h ] @xmath215 ( ramrez et al .",
    "regardless , just as an increase in [ @xmath21/fe ] would tend to reduce the difference between the ages inferred from the cmd and the binary , the age discrepancy would be exacerbated if the models assumed lower @xmath21-element abundances ( see the bottom , left - hand panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig15 ] ) .",
    "( note that different choices for the chemical abundance parameters would affect the corresponding zahb - based distances , but only slightly given that the adopted variations are small .",
    "nevertheless , this effect on the cmd age has not been taken into account . )",
    "another way of reconciling the binary mass - radius age with the cmd age is to increase the model temperatures .",
    "it is quite possible that the predicted @xmath65  scale is too cool because of deficiencies in , for instance , our treatment of the atmospheric boundary condition , convection , or diffusive processes .",
    "the impact of such a problem on the m - r diagram is illustrated by the short- and long - dashed curves in the upper left - hand panel .",
    "these show , in turn , how the location of the 11.0 gyr isochrone that is represented by the solid curve would be affected if the predicted temperatures were increased , or decreased , by 75 k. the effect on the inferred age is apparently @xmath216 gyr , respectively .",
    "thus , it would be possible to obtain ages from both the m - r diagram and the cmd that agree to within @xmath137 if the models were hotter by about 75 k. it turns out that , at the masses of the binary components , the temperatures along 11.011.75 gyr isochrones are cooler than those obtained from the radii and colors of v69 , but within @xmath217 k. since an upward revision in the predicted temperatures would improve the agreement , it seems likely that this is the correct way to obtain the best consistency between figs .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] and  [ fig : fig15 ] .",
    "note that improved consistency would not be obtained if we simply adopted an increased distance modulus by a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "because the components of v69 have measured magnitudes , models that match the observed radii , in combination with the predicted temperatures , also imply a particular value of the apparent distance modulus .",
    "since our adopted modulus is already at the high end of the range indicated by the uncertainties in the properties of the binary , any arbitary increase in @xmath197 will cause even larger discrepancies with the distance based on the binary .",
    "as already mentioned , other potential solutions include lowering the helium abundance and/or increasing the [ fe / h ] value , and we are considering such adjustments in a much more detailed study of 47 tuc and its binary v69 ( k.  brogaard et al . , in preparation ) . however , for the present study we have chosen to adopt the cbg09 metallicity scale and a particular variation of @xmath79 with [ fe / h ] for the entire gc sample .",
    "even if it is possible to argue for adjustments of these choices for a given cluster , it is not known whether they are unique to that cluster or whether they should be applied to the entire sample .",
    "therefore , no such variations have been explored here , especially as our main goal is to obtain the best estimates of _ relative _ gc ages .    with the adopted composition and apparent distance modulus",
    ", the implied mass loss agrees rather well with that determined by @xcite in the case of the super - metal - rich open cluster ngc@xmath106791 using asteroseismology .",
    "these investigators found a mean mass difference of @xmath218 between the lower rgb and the red hb clump , which suggests that the red hb stars in ngc@xmath106791 have masses that do not differ by more than @xmath219 .",
    "such a dispersion in the mass loss is also supported by the analysis of the cluster cmd carried out by @xcite . ) to within the uncertainties , this is the same as the value of @xmath220 found here from our fit of a zahb to the hb population of 47 tuc92 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ) suggests that its lowest mass hb star is only @xmath221 less massive than a 12.75 gyr star that has evolved to the hb without undergoing any mass loss whatsoever during its previous evolution",
    ". however , such estimates will be quite uncertain given the strong sensitivity of hb models to the assumed chemistry .",
    "for an excellent review of mass loss and its implications for the hb phase , see @xcite . ]",
    "given the apparent near constancy of the difference in the mass of the most and least massive stars that populate the red hbs of ngc@xmath106791 and 47 tuc , whose metallicities bracket those of the gcs in the metal - rich group under consideration , we believe that it is quite reasonable to assume that the same result applies to the latter . thus , to determine the distance modulus of each metal - rich gc in our sample , we have determined which zahb model has a mass that is @xmath204 less than the rgb tip mass for the adopted age ( ignoring mass loss along the giant branch ) : that model is identified by the intersection of a short horizontal line with the zahb .",
    "then the dereddened cluster photometry is shifted in the vertical direction until that horizontal line coincides with the faintest hb star in the cluster hb population , resulting in the adopted value of @xmath158 . if the maximum amount of mass loss that occurs prior to the zahb were , for instance , as small as @xmath222  or as large as @xmath223 , the derived distance modulus of 47 tuc ( and the other metal - rich gcs in our sample ) would be larger , or smaller , than our adopted modulus by only @xmath224 mag .",
    "this is not insignificant , but neither does it completely overwhelm other uncertainties .",
    "when distance moduli are derived in this way for the gcs that have [ fe / h ] @xmath225 , the zahbs and isochrones generally provide satisfactory matches to the observed photometry , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig16 ] .",
    "the least reliably determined ages are those for ngc@xmath105927 , ngc@xmath106304 , ngc@xmath106624 , and m@xmath1069 ( ngc@xmath106637 ) , as their cmds appear to be affected by significant differential reddening and/or substantial field - star contamination .",
    "note that , in none of the nine gcs , is the @xmath57 value less than 0.10 mag .",
    "except in the case of ngc@xmath106366 , where the hb stars are offset to the blue of their expected location relative to the zahb ( possibly due to a chemical abundance effect ) , the hb populations are quite well matched by the zahbs  though this is partly by design .",
    "schlegel et al .  (",
    "1998 ) reddenings have been assumed for all of the clusters except those considered in the top row as well as m@xmath1071 ( ngc@xmath106838 ) . in order to obtain a similar fit to their hb populations as those found for the other five clusters , it was necessary to adopt reduced reddenings by as little as 0.02 mag ( ngc@xmath106304 ) to as much as 0.08 mag ( ngc@xmath105927 ) . an important consequence of making such revisions is that the resultant @xmath120(color ) values become much more similar for all of the gcs in the sample .",
    "the mean age of this group , including 47 tuc , is 11.1 gyr , implying that metal - rich gcs are about 1.5 gyr younger than the most metal - deficient systems .",
    "this finding is at odds with the conclusion reached by mf09 , who found little or no difference in their ages .",
    "a resolution of these conflicting results is provided in ",
    "[ subsubsec : mf09 ] .",
    "it is readily appreciated that the @xmath85  method can not be used to determine very precise ages for globular clusters that have extremely blue hbs . in those systems in which the horizontal - branch populations are nearly vertical on the cmd , even small offsets in color ( due , e.g. , to reddening uncertainties )",
    "would have a big effect on the distances , and therefore ages , that are derived from fits of computed zahbs to the observations .",
    "in such cases , the relative age technique described by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 1990 ; hereafter vbs90 ) can be used to provide much tighter constraints on their absolute ages if , in particular , it is used to compare the cmds of two clusters that have similar chemical abundances but one of them has a red hb that is amenable to a @xmath85  analysis .",
    "the essence of the vbs90 procedure is to superimpose the principal photometric sequences of two gcs , simply by applying the necessary vertical and horizontal shifts to one of them , so that both have the same turnoff color and the same magnitude at a point on the upper ms that is 0.05 mag redder than the to .",
    "then whatever separation of their rgbs is found at , say , 2.8 mag above the latter fiducial point will be a direct measure of the difference in the age of the two clusters . in effect , relative gc ages are found from the difference in color between the msto and the rgb at a pre - selected , arbitrary point on the giant branch .",
    "this relative age diagnostic , which will henceforth be referred to as @xmath226 , where the  h \" represents  horizontal \" just as the  v \" in @xmath85  can be thought of as indicating  vertical \" , is independent of distance , reddening , and the zero - point of color calibrations .",
    "* also see mf09 ) have stated that this so - called  horizontal method \" of determining relative ages is sensitive to the assumed value of the mixing - length parameter ( @xmath102 ) , or more generally , the treatment of super - adiabatic convection , as well as the adopted color@xmath65  relations .",
    "they say that , as a consequence , this approach is  strongly model dependent \" .",
    "however , these are valid concerns only if the @xmath226  method is used to determine _ absolute _ ages ; indeed , vbs90 advised against such a practice in the paper that introduced this new _ relative_-age - dating technique .",
    "the latter relies only on how the color of the rgb , at a fixed magnitude , is affected by variations in age .",
    "because it involves such a narrow range in rgb colors and because it has no dependence on the zero - points of the color transformations , errors in the color@xmath65  relations will be inconsequential .    to support these assertions",
    "we have used the @xmath226  method to evaluate the relative ages of two hypothetical gcs whose rgbs differ in color by 0.015 mag at 2.8 mag above the ordinate zero - point when their cmds have been registered to one another according to the directions given by vbs90 ( see above ) .",
    "suppose both clusters have [ fe / h ] @xmath87 and normal helium and @xmath21-element abundances for that metallicity , and let us consider two sets of isochrones , for the same chemical abundances , which are otherwise identical except that one assumes @xmath227 while the other assumes @xmath83 .",
    "when similarly registered to one another , the isochrones based on the smaller value of the mixing - length parameter predict a _ much _ larger difference in color at 2.8 mag above the ordinate zero - point than those which assume @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , depending on which of the two grids of isochrones is used to evaluate the age corresponding to a given ( observed ) msto - to - rgb color difference , absolute ages that differ by @xmath228 gyr would be obtained .",
    "( clearly it is very risky to derive the absolute ages of star clusters in this way . )    however , for relative ages , it is only the difference in color between the rgb segments that matters . at the same magnitude offset from the ordinate zero - point ,",
    "the difference in color between , say , 11 and 13 gyr isochrones is 0.0221 mag if derived from the models for @xmath227 , versus 0.0195 mag in the case of those which assume @xmath83 .",
    "that is , the former predict a variation in color with age of 0.0109 mag / gyr as opposed to 0.0097 mag / gyr for the latter .",
    "( such slopes are not strictly constant as the difference in color , at a fixed luminosity between , e.g. , 11 and 12 gyr isochrones will generally be slightly larger that that found for 12 and 13 gyr isochrones  but this is a second - order effect . ) returning to the example of two clusters whose rgbs differ in color by 0.015 mag , the isochrones for @xmath227 predict an age difference of 1.55 gyr , while those for @xmath83 yield 1.38 gyr .",
    "thus , despite using isochrones with very different color offsets between the to and the rgb , the derived relative ages are nearly the same .",
    "even though this analysis considered isochrones that were computed for very different values of @xmath102 , we do not believe that there is compelling evidence that this parameter varies _ significantly _ with mass , metallicity , or evolutionary state .",
    "if it did , we would not obtain such good agreement between isochrones that assume a constant value of @xmath102  and the observed cmds of gcs that span at least 2 dex in [ fe / h ] ( see , e.g. , figs .  [ fig : fig11][fig : fig14 ] , [ fig : fig16 ] ) .",
    "in fact , models based on the same physics have been just as successful in explaining the observations of the old , super - metal - rich open cluster ngc@xmath106791 ( @xcite ) , whose properties have been especially tightly constrained through analyses of a few of the detached , eclipsing binary stars that it contains .",

    "for example , since isochrones for @xmath233 provide a superb fit to the cmd of ngc@xmath106791 ( see @xcite ) , the bonaca et al .",
    "results would suggest that models relevant to 47 tuc , which is @xmath234 dex more metal - poor than ngc@xmath106791 , should assume @xmath235 . to examine the implications of this choice ,",
    "this ( low ) value of the mixing - length parameter has been adopted in the computation of a grid of models for @xmath236 and [ fe / h ] @xmath195 ( i.e. , the same chemical abundances that were assumed in the models plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig14 ] ) .",
    "although not shown , these calculations predict temperatures that are 320 k and 390 k cooler near the base and the tip of the rgb , respectively , than those shown in that figure . furthermore , because of the steep dependence of the bolometric corrections and colors on @xmath65  in the case of cool giants , both the location and the slope of the predicted rgb are very discrepant relative to the observed giant branch . to be sure , the uncertainties are such that a small variation of @xmath102  with mass , metallicity , and/or evolutionary state can not be ruled out , but even if this parameter varied by @xmath10615% across the h - r diagram , which would require some compensating adjustments to the atmospheric boundary conditions and/or to the color@xmath65  relations in order to obtain comparable fits to observed cmds , our isochrone - fitting procedure would yield essentially identical ages ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "while , in principle , it should be possible to obtain rather precise relative ages using the vbs90 technique , the results do depend quite critically on whether or not the clusters whose cmds are intercompared have the same chemical abundances .",
    "for instance , @xcite pointed out early on that the same value of @xmath237 would be obtained for two gcs if they had identical metal abundances but differed in age by @xmath238% , or if they were coeval but had different [ o / fe ] values by @xmath239 dex ( assuming no other chemical differences ) .",
    "indeed , it turns out that cluster - to - cluster variations in @xmath79 or in the abundances of several of the other metals ( notably ne , mg , or si ; see vbd12 ) , would complicate the interpretation of @xmath226  measurements , especially at higher metallicities .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : fig17 ] , where 12 gyr isochrones for [ fe / h ] @xmath240 and 11 gyr isochrones for [ fe / h ] @xmath241 have been plotted with , and without , the assumed chemical abundance variations that are indicated in the top left - hand corner of each of the six panels that comprise this plot .",
    "the isochrones , which have been taken from vbd12 , have been registered to one another using the vbs90 prescription : the zero - point of the abscissa coincides with the to color , while the magnitude at the point on the upper ms that is 0.05 mag redder than the turnoff defines the zero - point of the ordinate ( note the location of the filled circle on the 12 gyr isochrones ) .",
    "the insert in the upper left - hand panel plots the relative locations of the rgb segments of isochrones for the two values of [ fe / h ] , and ages from 10.5 to 13.5 gyr in 1.0 gyr steps .",
    "they were arbitarily moved to the region enclosed by the dotted rectangle ( simply for display purposes ) from original ordinate values ranging from @xmath242 to @xmath243 . by comparing these results with the predicted color offsets of the rgbs ( at an ordinate value of @xmath244 ) that arise from chemical composition variations ,",
    "one finds , for instance , that a 0.4 dex increase in the value of [ o / fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath240 ( right - hand plot , top row ) mimicks the effect on the rgb location that is comparable to the shift produced by about a 1 gyr increase in age .",
    "similarly , a higher value of [ mg / fe ] by 0.4 dex at [ fe / h ] @xmath168 ( middle panel , bottom row ) apparently causes a redward offset of the rgb ( relative to the to ) that is approximately equivalent to that predicted for a @xmath245 gyr reduction in age .",
    "these are just rough estimates : fig .",
    "[ fig : fig17 ] has been included here mainly to illustrate qualitatively how cluster - to - cluster differences in age and chemical abundances affect the @xmath226  parameter .",

    "[ fig : fig17 ] are not nearly as serious as this plot suggests . moreover , since the majority of the gcs that have extremely blue hbs have [ fe / h ] @xmath50 , the only abundance variations that appear to have detectable consequences for @xmath226-based estimates of their relative ages are those of helium and/or oxygen .",
    "fortunately , differences in @xmath79 can be distinguished from differences in [ o / fe ] because the former have bigger effects on the slope of the subgiant branch than the latter .",
    "this is most easily seen when isochrones are superimposed according to the vbs90 procedure ( compare the plots in the upper left- and right - hand panels ) .",
    "it is worth reiterating that , as discussed by vbd12 , the age - sensitive parts of isochrones _ for low metallicities _",
    "depend almost entirely on the absolute c@xmath166n@xmath166o abundances ( or [ cno / h ] coupled with the cno abundances in the adopted solar mixture ) .",
    "the [ fe / h ] value is a useful way of  tagging \" gcs because , with few exceptions , it does not vary significantly from star - to - star within a given cluster ( as already mentioned ) .",
    "it also provides a good  label \" for isochrones given that a given metals mixture , with or without some adjustments to the solar @xmath24/fe number abundance ratios , is normally scaled to any desired [ fe / h ] value . however , the iron abundance is far less important than the [ o / h ] ( @xmath26 [ fe / h ] @xmath166 [ o / fe ] ) value at low @xmath247 .    although fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] showed that the morphology of isochrones ( for [ fe / h ] @xmath95 ) in the vicinity of the turnoff is nearly independent of age , there is some age dependence of the luminosity , and slope , of the sgb at the lowest metallicities .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig18 ] , 1113 gyr isochrones for [ fe / h ] @xmath37 begin to deviate from one another just past the turnoff , while those for higher metallicities do so at colors , relative to the to , that become steadily  redder as the [ fe / h ] value increases .",

    "while these differences are still rather small , they nevertheless resemble the effects of enhanced @xmath79 on the sgb at a fixed age ( see the top left - hand panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig17 ] ) . this should be kept in mind when interpreting any cluster - to - cluster differences in the morphologies of their cmds that are found when the latter are registered to one another according to the directions given by vbs90 .",
    "it is obviously important to apply the @xmath226  method to the gcs that have already been considered , in order to check that the relative ages of clusters with similar metallicities are consistent with the differences in their @xmath85  ages .",
    "however , we will first turn our attention to a few  second - parameter \" clusters and then consider several systems with extremely blue hbs .",
    "the advantage of proceeding in this way is that the latter appear to provide some valuable insights ( or at least  food for thought \" ) concerning the second - generation stars in gcs that may be relevant to a subset of the [ fe / h ] @xmath50 clusters that were the subject of ",
    "[ subsec : std ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig19 ] illustrates the fiducial sequences that have been derived for m@xmath103 and m@xmath1013 .",
    "why these clusters have such different hb morphologies , despite having similar metallicities , is still an open question even though extensive efforts have been made during the past 40 years to try to solve this puzzle ( see , e.g. , the review by @xcite ) . since age and/or chemical abundance differences , notably of he or the cno elements , are the most likely second parameters ( after [ fe / h ] , which is the first parameter ) , it is possible that variations in the properties of the multiple stellar populations that all gcs appear to contain are responsible for this phenomenon . furthermore , given that age , @xmath79 , and [ cno / fe ] affect isochrones in different ways ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig17 ] ) , the differences between the cmds of m@xmath103 and m@xmath1013 for turnoff to lower - rgb stars should provide vital clues concerning the identification of the second parameter , or of their relative importance if there is more than one .",
    "accordingly , considerable care has been taken to accurately determine the median photometric sequence through the ms , sgb , and lower rgb of each cluster . to do this",
    ", we sorted the photometry into 0.10 mag bins , determined the median magnitude and color in each bin , and then ( for the lower rgb ) performed a least - squares cubic fit to the 18 - 20 points so obtained . to determine the turnoff color , the median points for three bins both above and below the to were fitted by a least - squares quadratic , which was then evaluated over small intervals of @xmath248 to determine the bluest color .",
    "a similar process was used to derive the magnitude at the color on the upper ms which is 0.05 mag redder than the to color , using the median points from 8 neighboring bins .",
    "( approximate distance moduli and the adopted cluster reddenings have been assumed in constructing fig .  [",
    "fig : fig19 ] so that the same regions of both cmds are displayed , thereby facilitating visual comparisons . )",
    "unfortunately , the age - dependent @xmath226  parameter is also predicted to be a fairly sensitive function of [ fe / h ] at a fixed age ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "although the vbs90 registration procedure was not used to produce the latter , it is quite obvious that nearly the same figure would have been obtained had it been employed : the isochrones plotted therein would require only slight vertical shifts in order for them to pass through the usual registration zero - points for the @xmath249- and @xmath250-axes . from suitable plots ,",
    "we find that a 0.1 dex difference in the relative metal abundances of two gcs whose cmds are intercompared would affect the inferred age difference by 0.250.5 gyr .",
    "this can be taken as the uncertainty of relative age estimates based on the horizontal method since most [ fe / h ] determinations are uncertain by @xmath2510.10 dex in a relative sense ( versus @xmath2520.20 dex in an absolute sense ) . to obtain the best consistency with @xmath85  ages ,",
    "it is , in fact , necessary ( see   [ subsubsec : blue ] ) to take metallicity differences into account when using msto - to - rgb colors to evaluate relative gc ages .",
    "how we have done this is illustrated in the upper left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig20 ] , which plots the the fiducial sequences of m@xmath103 and m@xmath1013 after they have been registered to one another .",
    "( to minimize space requirements , only the region from just below the to to the lower rgb has been plotted . )",
    "the dashed lines plot the rgb segments of 10.5 to 13.5 gyr isochrones , in 0.5 gyr steps , for @xmath124 and [ fe / h ] @xmath253 ( i.e. , for chemical abundance parameters that we have adopted for m@xmath103 ) .",
    "however , we could have opted to plot the giant - branch loci for a somewhat higher or lower metallicity without any misgivings because the age - dependent separations of the rgbs vary only weakly with [ fe / h ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig18 ] ) . given the uncertainties that were discussed in the previous paragraph",
    ", it does not matter that the horizontal displacement between the giant branches of , say , 10.5 and 11.0 gyr isochrones is slightly larger than that of 12.5 and 13.0 gyr isochrones ; consequently , it is not necessary to assume a specific age ( in gyr ) for one of the gcs and then deduce the absolute age of the other cluster from the overlap of its giant branch onto the isochrone rgbs .",
    "in fact , it is our usual practice to adjust the location of the grid of dashed lines by whatever color offset is needed so that the giant branch of one of the clusters coincides with the third or fourth isochrone .",
    "then , just by inspection of the observed separation of the gc giant branches relative to the dashed lines , which differ in age by 0.5 gyr ( in the direction from  younger \" to  older \" , as indicated ) , the difference in the cluster ages is readily evaluated .",
    "the length of the horizontal line which connects the small filled circle at an ordinate value of @xmath254 to the short solid line that has the same slope as the dashed loci represents the correction to the color of the m@xmath103 rgb that should be applied to it to remove the effect on the @xmath226  parameter of the difference in the cluster metallicities .",
    "thus , whereas the separation of the solid and dashed curves suggests that the two gcs differ in age by about 0.5 gyr , the models actually predict an age difference closer to 1.0 gyr if the nearly 0.1 dex difference in their [ fe / h ] values is taken into account .",
    "however , according to the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig18 ] , the cluster sgbs should overlay one another if age is the main distinguishing property of m@xmath103 and m@xmath1013 .",
    "this is clearly not the case .",

    "[ fig : fig20 ] indicates that a difference in @xmath79 is a much more viable way of explaining the offset in the cluster subgiant branches .",
    "the lower left - hand panel shows that , if m@xmath103 has @xmath124 and an age of 11.75 gyr ( which will be justified shortly ) , it is then possible to reproduce the observations in the panel just above it if m@xmath1013 has @xmath255 and an age of 12.012.25 gyr .",
    "we initially thought that similar consistency could be obtained if m@xmath1013 had an age of @xmath256 gyr , @xmath255 , and an enhanced o abundance by @xmath120[o / fe ] @xmath257 dex , since the effect of the latter is to displace the rgb for a fixed age to somewhat bluer colors _ relative to the turnoff _",

    "[ it is , of course , the c@xmath166n@xmath166o abundance that is important ; i.e. , the same results would be found if n , instead of o , were enhanced by a sufficient amount that @xmath120[cno / fe ] @xmath257 .",
    "in fact , this alternative is arguably the favored one given that helium - rich stars in @xmath161cen ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and in ngc@xmath102808 ( @xcite ) have low oxygen , and rather high nitrogen , abundances . ]    however , the main effect of increasing the c@xmath166n@xmath166o abundance on isochrones is to reduce the age at a given turnoff luminosity ( or equivalently , to displace an isochrone for a fixed age to a lower to luminosity ) .",
    "this tends to increase the separation between the msto and the giant branch ; compare the dashed and dotted curves in the lower right - hand panel . to obtain a reduced separation ,",

    "the main conclusion to be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig20 ] is that m@xmath1013 appears to have a higher helium abundance than m@xmath103 , as there does not appear to be any other way of explaining the differences in the morphologies of their cmds between the turnoff and the rgb .",
    "( the same solution of this problem was first proposed by @xcite . )",
    "it is certainly very fortunate that variations in the abundance of helium can be detected in this way  if the model predictions can be relied upon  in view of the fact that @xmath79 is normally very difficult to determine in cool stars , due to the lack of detectable he lines in their spectra .",
    "this does not necessarily imply , however , that there are no significant star - to - star variations of @xmath79 in either cluster .",
    "the more general conclusion to be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig20 ] is that the _ average _ helium content of m@xmath1013 appears to be higher than that of m@xmath103 ( by , say , @xmath258 ) .",
    "in fact , the possibility that all of the stars in m@xmath1013 had the same high value of @xmath79 when they formed presents some difficulties for the interpretation of the cluster cmd .",
    "suppose , for instance , that m@xmath1013 has an age of 12.25 gyr and @xmath255 , versus 11.75 gyr and @xmath124 for m@xmath103 ; i.e. , that their properties differ in ways that are compatible with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig20 ] .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig21 ] , the isochrone for the adopted parameters is able to reproduce the turnoff of m@xmath1013 only if the apparent distance modulus is 14.40 , assuming @xmath259 ( schlegel et al .",
    "in fact , that isochrone provides an especially agreeable fit to the ms - to - rgb populations , including , in particular , the slope of the subgiant branch . however , the fully consistent zahb locus is clearly too bright relative to the observed hb stars with @xmath260 .",
    "one way of achieving a satifactory simultaneous fit of the models to the entire cmd of m@xmath1013 is to assume that this cluster has two or more chemically distinct stellar populations characterized by different helium ( and possibly cno ) abundances .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : fig22 ] shows that the lower bound to the distribution of hb stars can be matched quite well by a zahb for @xmath124 and [ fe / h ] @xmath261 if m@xmath1013 has @xmath262 . since , on this color plane , the location of the blue hb tail is insensitive to the value of @xmath79 , it is not possible to distinguish between the high- and low-@xmath79 hb populations if the former evolve to zahb structures that are well to the blue of the instability strip .",
    "the brightest / reddest hb stars may be either evolved stars from zero - age locations along the blue tail or they may be near - zahb stars with @xmath263 ( given their proximity to the dashed curve ) , especially if they also have high cno abundances , which tends to drive hb stars of a given mass to redder colors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "[ @xcite also suggested that the reddest hb stars in m@xmath1013 are probably evolved stars , in part because this is implied by the distance modulus that is obtained using the rgb - tip standard candle ( @xcite ) . ]",
    "the observed widths of the m@xmath1013 ms and rgb certainly appear to be large enough to accommodate a large spread in helium abundance , as indicated by the 12.0 gyr isochrones for @xmath124 ( solid curve ) and @xmath264 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "in fact , the widths of the principal photometric sequences ( also in the case of m@xmath103 , see the right - hand panel ) are artificially broadened due to photometric errors arising from crowding and other effects , which can be expected to be especially severe in the most populous clusters .",
    "although we generally selected stars with tabulated errors of @xmath265 mag , a large fraction of the stars , especially those on the giant branch , appear to have been measured only once ( based on our limited examination of the impact of culling the data in various ways ) .",
    "if we further restrict the number of stars to those with 4 or more observations in both @xmath266 and @xmath267 , the resultant cmds for the main sequences of m@xmath103 and m@xmath1013 are tightened considerably , though the ms widths still remain somewhat larger than the difference between the solid and dashed loci in the left - hand panel of fig .

    "we are unsure as to whether or not this is the true intrinsic width , but we have assumed that it is . moreover , it is our impression that the tightest cmds that we are able to obtain for the most massive clusters are broader , with thicker subgiant branches ( @xmath2680.15 mag , at a given color ) , than those of lower mass , but further work is needed to do a proper evaluation . in any case , this is an important caveat that should be kept in mind .",

    "of course , for a difference in @xmath79 to be the main cause of the different sgb morphologies ( see fig .",

    "it is a concern , however , that the @xmath226  diagnostic is sensitive to metal abundance differences , as already pointed out .",

    "an example of a cluster that is chemically very different from ngc@xmath105466 is m@xmath1015 , which happens to be one of the most massive clusters in the milky way . @xcite have found that the c and n abundances in its subgiant and lower rgb stars vary by @xmath245 and @xmath294 dex , respectively .",

    "consequently , the effects on the sgb due to a metal abundance increase could be comparable to , and compensate for , those caused by a moderate helium abundance enhancement , and vice versa .",

    "remarkably , it turns out that most of the clusters in the latter sequence , which include m@xmath1012 , ngc@xmath106362 , ngc@xmath106717 , and 47 tuc , have disk - like kinematics according to @xcite , and it is possible that the other two [ fe / h ] @xmath338 gcs in this small group ( ngc@xmath106717 and ngc@xmath106723 ) do so as well , but we have been unable to find any orbital information for them .",

    "in fact , the main point of contention is whether the gcs that have [ fe / h ] @xmath77 are of comparable age as the most metal - deficient clusters , as they reported , or younger by @xmath3412 gyr , as derived in this investigation . in the next section , an explanation of the main cause of this discrepancy",
    "is provided .    however , before turning to that discussion , a few comments should be made concerning fig .",
    "[ fig : fig34 ] .",
    "first , considering the entire data set , there is virtually no dependence of the mean age or the dispersion in age on r@xmath342 .",
    "second , whereas the clusters in our sample with [ fe / h ] @xmath343 are all located within 8 kpc from the center of the milky way , those of lower metal abundances are distributed over the entire range in galactocentric distance that has been plotted .",
    "( pal 12 , which has [ fe / h ] @xmath344 and r@xmath345 kpc , is an  exception to the rule \" , and there are likely to be others , but this cluster is believed to have originated in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy and therefore _ may _ belong to a different category than the other metal - rich gcs in our sample .",
    "moreover , as noted above , pal 12 appears to be connected with a different amr than the other gcs in our sample that have [ fe / h ] @xmath346 . )",
    "finally , there is quite a striking difference in the ages of the clusters that have [ fe / h ] @xmath347 and those that have [ fe / h ] @xmath343 , which is , of course , just a reflection of the amr shown in the previous figure .",
    "our finding that old , very metal - poor gcs are found at any r@xmath9 , while the majority of the metal - rich clusters are younger and located at smaller galactocentric distances , suggests an  outside  in \" scenario for the formation of the galaxy .",
    "given the evidence of sagittarius , there is no denying that mergers of dwarf galaxies are responsible for many of the gcs that reside in the milky way .",
    "however , it also seems very likely that many of them formed during the collapse of a single , massive protogalaxy , perhaps as described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) , or by @xcite , who suggested that protogalactic filaments first collapsed in a direction perpendicular to their lengths and then along their lengths . to improve our understanding",
    ", it would be helpful to include bulge gcs in the sample , as well as clusters that are located at r@xmath348 kpc .",
    "[ in fact , the amr that is analyzed by leaman et al .",
    "( 2013 ) includes the six outer - halo clusters that were the subject of a paper by @xcite . ]",
    "it took some careful detective work to understand why the results obtained by mf09 conflict with ours . in fact , the main reasons for the difference is that ( i ) the rmsf method that was devised , and used , by mf09 is especially sensitive to the adopted metal abundances and ( ii ) the [ @xmath24/h ] values that they adopted involve some inconsistencies .",
    "this can be appreciated by considering the results shown in figure  [ fig : fig35 ] , which plots the age[@xmath24/h ] relations that are obtained using the rmsf method on the assumption of different metallicity scales .",
    "the top two panels reproduce their figs .  10 and 11 for a subset of the sample of gcs that they considered : only those clusters with normalized relative ages @xmath349 and those without [ fe / h ] determinations by cbg09",
    "have been omitted .",
    "note that we have added  r97 \" to the labels in the upper left - hand corner of these two panels to emphasize that the metal abundances used by mf09 were obtained from the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter r97 ) catalog . in the case of clusters not considered by r97 ( those represented by small filled circles )",
    ", mf09 adopted the metallicities given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zw ) and transformed them to the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cg ) scale using the equation given by @xcite .",
    "the results plotted in panel ( a ) , which assume the cg scale of r97 , do indicate that there is a population of coeval gcs that spans the entire metallicity range .",
    "however , this is not the case if the zw scale is adopted ; see panel ( b ) . despite the evidence to the contrary , mf09",
    "( see their footnote 14 ) conclude that the results derived from the two metallicity scales are equivalent , and then proceed to use only the cg results for their subsequent analysis .",
    "however , as seen by comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) , there are differences between them  and , for the following reason , we believe that the cg scale of r97 is the least trustworthy one . in footnotes to their table of [ fe / h ] values , r97 warn the reader that , for several clusters at the metal - rich end , [ fe / h ] values on the cg scale have been obtained by extrapolating their ca ii triplet measurements linearly past the most metal - rich cluster that had an [ fe / h ] value determined from high - resolution spectra .",
    "this is of particular concern because , as discussed by r97 , there is an inconsistency between the cg and zw scales as derived from their calibration of ca ii triplet line strengths , likely because the ca ii lines lose their sensitivity to [ fe / h ] at the metal - rich end .",
    "in fact , most of that inconsistency was removed by @xcite when they obtained and analyzed spectra for stars in two very metal - rich clusters . had mf09 employed the non - linear equation derived by carretta et al .  to transform _ all _ of the zw metallicities to the cg scale , instead of just a subset of them",
    ", they would have obtained the amr shown in panel ( c ) .",
    "values given by mf09 ( in their table 1 ) for ngc@xmath106144 , ngc@xmath106584 , ngc@xmath106652 , and m@xmath1056 are incorrect , though the [ @xmath24/h ] values that are given for these same clusters in their table 4 are fine .",
    "we also found that the transformation equation from carretta et al .",
    "was not used to derive the cg / r97 [ @xmath24/h ] values of m@xmath103 and m@xmath1092 : the [ fe / h ] values for these clusters were presumably taken directly from @xcite .",
    "] at the metal - rich end , this resembles the relationship plotted in panel ( b ) more so than in panel ( a ) and , importantly , it also looks similar to the amr shown in panel ( d ) .",
    "this is based on the more recent metallicity scale of cbg09 ( as adopted in our investigation ) , where a non - linear relationship between the ca ii triplet measurements and [ fe / h ] is further supported by high - resolution spectroscopy of two additional high - metallicity clusters . to obtain the results of panels ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , we used the turnoff magnitudes given by mf09 ( from their table 4 ) and [ @xmath24/h ] values that were calculated from the corresponding [ fe / h ] determinations using their equation ( 3 ) . to derive the relative ages that are plotted in these panels",
    ", we assumed that @xmath350[@xmath24/h ] ) @xmath351 gyr / dex , which is a good approximation to the predicted variation of age with [ @xmath24/h ] in their fig .  7 , together with their relative ages and corresponding age zero - point to obtain new absolute ages .",
    "these were then transformed back to relative ages using the same zero - point as mf09 ; namely , the mean age of clusters with [ @xmath24/h ] @xmath27 . indeed ,",
    "when the same cbg09 metallicities are adopted , relative ages based on the mf09 formalism ( panel d ) appear to be quite similar to our findings .",
    "the results shown in panels ( a ) to ( d ) demonstrate that the mf09 approach is exceedingly sensitive to the adopted chemical abundances ( which are likely to undergo further adjustments in the future ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in   [ sec : methods ] , the @xmath85  method that is the basis of most of our age determinations is not particularly dependent on the assumed [ fe / h ] scale : the effect of metallicity on the luminosity of the hb is compensated to a significant extent by its effect on the turnoff luminosity at a given age .",
    "this is a huge advantage .",
    "even if we had adopted the cg / r97 abundance scale , we would not have obtained an age - metallicity relation that is similar to the one reported by mf09 .",
    "also worth emphasizing is the fact that , as acknowledged by mf09 , the rmsf technique is sensitive to the abundances of such elements as mg and al , which have been observed to vary from cluster - to - cluster ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these , and several other abundant heavy elements affect the color offset between the msto and the rgb at a fixed age much more so than the luminosity of the turnoff ( see vbd12 and our fig .  [",
    "fig : fig17 ] ) . at low metallicities , the turnoff luminosity versus age relations are strong functions of the helium and oxygen abundances , and little else .",
    "( it is also a clear disadvantage of the @xmath226  method of determining relative ages that it is a sensitive function of [ fe / h ] and the detailed heavy - element mixture .",
    "this method , which should be applied _ only _ to clusters that have the same metal abundances , is clearly of limited usefulness . )",
    "a further concern with the mf09 results is that , if the cbg09 metallicities are correct , there is a 0.65 dex difference in the [ @xmath24/h ] values of the reference clusters that were used for the two most metal - rich groups of gcs .",
    "coupled with the likelihood that the clusters with high [ fe / h ] values are more metal - rich and younger than assumed by mf09 , the errors in the inferred ages from the rmsf method will be increased .",
    "consider , in particular , their fig .",
    "6 ( or our fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) , which shows that the lower ms slopes of computed isochrones vary significantly with [ fe / h ] , especially at higher metallicities .",
    "such variations make the result of the rmsf method dependent on the exact magnitude range that is used and on the difference in the metal abundances between that of the reference cluster for a given metallicity bin and those of each of the target clusters in that group .",
    "in fact , the self - consistency test that they show in their fig .",
    "6 considers only relatively small variations in [ @xmath24/h ] : the impact of varying the age was not examined . moreover",
    ", their test does not extend above [ @xmath24/h ] @xmath352 , where the difficulties will be exacerbated .",
    "mf09 found from their consideration of a few different grids of evolutionary models that their results were essentially independent of this choice .",
    "this is probably to be expected given that it is the differences between the isochrones for different ages that matter rather than their location on the cmd in an absolute sense .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fig36 ] , both the dsep and the basti ( @xcite ) isochrones predict similar , though not identical , separations between the isochrone rgbs for different ages at a fixed [ fe / h ] ( left - hand panels ) , and for variations in [ fe / h ] at a given age ( right - hand panels ) when the isochrones are registered to the usual abscissa and ordinate zero - points .",
    "these results compare quite well with those derived from the victoria - regina isochrones used in this investigation ( see the right - hand panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , respectively ) .",
    "there are certainly some morphological differences between the three sets of models , and the separation of the giant branch from the msto is obviously much larger in the case of the basti isochrones than in the dsep or victoria - regina predictions .",
    "this is probably caused primarily by the neglect of diffusive processes in the basti computations , though differences in the treatment of convection , the atmospheric boundary condition , the adopted color@xmath65relations , or the detailed heavy - element mixture may also be partially responsible for this .",
    "( since the giant branches of the best - fit victoria - regina isochrones tend to be on the red side of observed rgbs when the predicted and observed turnoffs are matched , the published basti isochrones can be expected to be more discrepant , if the same distance and metallicity scales are adopted . )    to conclude : we believe that we have provided compelling arguments that the mf09 findings are suspect , particularly for metal - rich gcs . in this regard , the importance of the binary in 47 tuc should not be overlooked , as it indicates a clear preference for a relatively young cluster age ( recall fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15 ] ) .",
    "( any increase in the assumed helium abundance of this system would only serve to reduce the derived age . ) in addition , the rmsf method , but not our implementation of the @xmath85  method , requires that the to luminosity be determined as accurately as possible .",
    "this quantity is very hard to define in the cmds of metal - rich gcs , in particular , given that they tend to be nearly vertical over a @xmath175 mag range in the vicinity of the turnoff , and it is likely to be especially ambiguous in clusters containing multiple stellar populations .",
    "regardless of this practical difficulty , a compelling reason to avoid using the to luminosity was provided by @xcite , who showed that interpolations within grids of evolutionary tracks that differed only in the treatment of superadiabatic convection yielded isochrones with different to luminosity versus age relations .",
    "this was attributed to the effects of _ interpolating _ in tracks that were morphologically quite different since , as their work also demonstrated , the to luminosities of evolutionary tracks ( as opposed to isochrones ) have no more than a slight dependence on how the convective gradient is determined in surface convection zones .",
    "in addition , because of the strong sensitivity of the rmsf technique to the assumed [ fe / h ] determinations  something which was properly examined by mf09 and not studied at all by @xcite  coupled with the uncertainties and the errors ( albeit small errors , see   [ subsec : general ] ) inherent to the actual fitting process , we dispute the claim made by @xcite that their approach is  much more suitable than other techniques for retrieving relative gc ages \" .      in this investigation ,",
    "globular cluster ages have been determined using what we believe is the most robust , objective , and least model - dependent method currently in use , as it places almost no reliance on predicted temperatures and colors and it has less of a dependence on metal abundances than other techniques . to derive the best estimate of the age of a given gc , for the assumed distance and chemical abundances , our isochrones have been adjusted in color by whatever amount is necessary ( typically by @xmath353 mag ) in order to match the observed turnoff color , thereby facilitating the identification of that isochrone which reproduces the observed cmd _ just _ in the vicinity of the to .",
    "the morphology from @xmath234 mag below the to through to the beginning of the sgb ( where the subgiants have colors that differ from the median turnoff color by @xmath354 mag ) is predicted to be essentially independent of age , helium and metal abundances , and even the value of the mixing - length parameter ( see figs .",

    "ages that have been derived in this way provide reasonably satisfactory fits to the entire cmds , except that the predicted rgbs tend to lie on the red side of the observed giant branches .",
    "the uncertainties in the inferred ages primarily reflect the uncertainties in the adopted distances and chemical abundances .",
    "it is important to appreciate that discrepancies between predicted and observed colors are of little concern for the ages so obtained .",
    "indeed , isochrones will generally fail to provide the best possible match to an observed cmd when well - supported estimates of the distance , reddening , and metal abundances are assumed because , e.g. , the adopted cluster parameters ( which have significant uncertainties ) may not be quite right , the color-@xmath65 relations suffer from small zero - point or systematic errors , or there are problems with the stellar models concerning , among other things , the treatment of convection , diffusion , and/or the atmospheric boundary conditions .",
    "there is , in particular , no justification for favoring that isochrone which provides the best simultaneous fit to the observed msto and the rgb , or for making small adjustments to the cluster @xmath355 , @xmath57 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath79 , or [ @xmath21/fe ] values if they are made solely to improve the quality of the fit to the cmd  because both approaches assume that the models _ should _ reproduce the photometric data .",
    "this is not necessarily the case .    for instance",
    ", super - adiabatic convection is usually treated using the mixing - length theory ( @xcite ) , which involves the free parameter @xmath102 ( and a few others ) .",
    "it is unlikely that this parameter is a constant ( i.e. , independent of mass , chemical composition , and evolutionary state ) , even though it is treated as such .",
    "( although studies of gcs appear to rule out large variations of @xmath102 , as discussed in   [ subsec : msrg ] , the uncertainties associated with the basic properties of stars are still too large to rule out variations at , say , the @xmath10615% level . ) in fact , @xcite have argued , from their 3-d simulations of surface convection in solar abundance stars ( the only metallicity that they considered in their initial investigation ) , in support of a particular variation of @xmath356 with @xmath65  and gravity .",
    "( as far as we are aware , the implications of these predictions for stellar models have yet to be determined . ) a free parameter , @xmath357 also appears in formulations of the extra mixing ( see @xcite , vbd12 ) that appears to be needed below outer convection zones in order for diffusive models to account for the low abundance of lithium in the sun and to successfully predict the near independence of the li abundance with @xmath65  at the hot end of the  spite plateau \" ( @xcite ) .",
    "it could turn out that , when the models incorporate a better treatment of convection or of turbulent mixing , the resultant isochrones will provide improved fits to observed cmds . if the physics in current models is lacking in some way , some discrepancies between theoretical models and observations _ should _ be expected .",
    "for the same reasons , suggestions that a more objective , least - squares or maximum likelihood numerical method should be used to select which isochrone best represents an observed cmd are indefensible .",
    "a few studies over the years have even advocated that some kind of global optimization method be employed to derive such cluster properties as their distances , reddenings , and metallicities , as well as their ages ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as long as free parameters are used in some of the physics ingredients of stellar models , one must continue to be wary of relying on the latter ( primarily the predicted @xmath65  and color scales ) in an absolute , or even relative , sense .",
    "even if the physics were more robust than it is at present , there will continue to be uncertainties in the opacities and nuclear reactions , as well as in the observed properties of stellar populations .",
    "many things must be known to very high accuracy in order to obtain  perfect \" fits of models to photometric data .",
    "it is , in fact , quite encouraging that current models reproduce observed cmds as well as they do .",
    "analyses of observations of complex stellar populations , such as those found in dwarf galaxies or in the galactic bulge , or those which are so distant that only giant branch , and possibly hb , stars can be observed clearly require well - constrained stellar models in order to obtain the best possible interpretations of the data . for such studies ,",
    "it is important to  calibrate \" the isochrones ( e.g. , suitably adjust the color@xmath65  relations ) to fit the observations of nearby open and globular star clusters , so that the inferred ages and other properties of the target system are then determined _ relative _ to those of the calibrating objects .",
    "this is the approach taken by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "sophisticated statistical methods that use , e.g. , monte carlo or bayesian techniques to analyze observed cmds should _ only _ be employed after the stellar models that are used have been thoroughly tested and corrected , as necessary , in order to satisfy empirical constraints as well as possible .",
    "our discovery that the majority of the most metal - deficient gcs can be divided into two distinct groups , depending on the slope of the subgiant branch in their observed cmds ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) , is the most intriguing result of this investigation .",
    "it is also surprising that the total number of clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 is almost evenly divided into the two groups ( see below ) .",
    "such a near fifty - fifty split brings to mind the work of @xcite , who speculated from his analysis of gc orbits that there may have been a merger of a massive object ( or objects ) containing m@xmath103like stellar populations with the protogalaxy .",
    "( such a merger , if it happened , could only have occurred very early in the evolution of the milky way , since the galaxy appears to have had a relatively quiescent history since thick - disk formation ; see @xcite . )",

    "however , orbital information was not available at that time for many of the gcs in our sample and , in the case of a few clusters in common to the two studies , the orbits were classified by van den bergh as  indeterminate \" ( see his table 6 ) .    fortunately , the orbital characteristics of many of the metal - poor gcs considered here are given by dinescu et al .",
    "( 1999a ) : we have extracted from their paper the information that is given in table  [ tab : tab3 ] . while there is a tendency for the m@xmath103-like clusters to have larger eccentricities ( @xmath358 ) and ( especially ) apogalactic distances ( r@xmath359 ) , and to reach greater heights above the plane ( @xmath360 ) , than the clusters in the group containing m@xmath1013 , there are notable exceptions no matter what orbital property is considered .",
    "for instance , m@xmath1092 has a higher eccentricity than most of the gcs that have relatively flat sgbs , and m@xmath1013 has significantly higher values of @xmath358 , r@xmath359 , and @xmath360 than m@xmath103 .",

    "admittedly , we were beginning to question whether the division of the metal - poor gcs into two groups was real @xmath160 until we produced figure  [ fig : fig37 ] .",
    "this shows that the clusters which have similar sgb slopes as m@xmath103 ( those represented by _ open circles _ ) are predominately low - luminosity systems that have relatively large values of r@xmath9 ( and r@xmath359 , as already mentioned).3-like cluster is not the same as ours . in his investigation , gcs that either have a relatively red hb , like that of m@xmath103 , or belong to oosterhoff class i were considered to be m@xmath103like .",

    "the clusters belonging to the group represented by m@xmath1013 ( those plotted as _ filled circles _ ) are intrinsically bright objects and , with the exception of m@xmath1013 , their orbits do not extend beyond @xmath106 kpc from the galactic center ( see table  [ tab : tab3 ] ) . note that composite symbols have been used for three gcs to indicate that they have intermediate sgb slopes for their metallicities and , consequently , could not be assigned to either of the aforementioned groups .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : fig38 ] plots the hb types of the same sample of clusters as a function of [ fe / h ] , using the same symbols as in the previous figure .",
    "not unexpectedly , the m@xmath1013-like clusters have exclusively blue hbs , but it is also apparent that there are many gcs with very blue horizontal branches ( especially at @xmath361 [ fe / h ] @xmath347 ) that apparently belong to the other group .",
    "the middle panel , reveals that , at [ fe / h ] @xmath362 , there is no separation of the two groups insofar as their ages are concerned .",

    "moreover , as shown in the classic paper by @xcite , much larger age differences ( @xmath363 gyr ) are needed to explain the wide variation in the hb types at similar metallicities if age is the controlling second parameter .",
    "if we are correct in attributing the differences between the m@xmath103 and m@xmath1013 families of gcs to helium abundance variations , these results imply that the most important second parameter is @xmath79 .",
    "( however , the possibility should be kept in mind that cluster - to - cluster variations in the total c@xmath166n@xmath166o abundance at a given metallicity may be present , which could impact both the observed hb morphologies and the predicted ages .",

    "a recent examination of several of the global properties of @xmath364 gcs was carried out by @xcite , who showed , among other things , that their central concentrations ( @xmath365 , where @xmath366 and @xmath367 are , respectively , the tidal and core radii ) are independent of metallicity , that clusters with collapsed cores tend to located close to the center of the galaxy , and that there is no more than a weak correlation between [ fe / h ] and r@xmath9 .",
    "he also found no unambiguous correlation of the cluster ellipticity with other parameters .",
    "we have not subjected our small sample of 28 metal - poor clusters to the same analysis , though we were motivated to check whether the ellipticity , which is presumably a tracer of the orbital , and perhaps stellar , rotational velocities , provided any discrimination between the two groups .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ) that the horizontal - branch stars in gcs that have anomalously blue hbs for their metallicity , such as m@xmath1013 , rotate significantly faster than those found in systems with intermediate or red hb types . increased mass loss during the giant - branch phase , which would promote bluer hbs , could well be an important consequence of higher rotational velocities ( @xcite ) , just as the spread in mass that is needed to explain observed hbs is likely to have some connection to star - to - star variations in the stellar rotation rates .",
    "the fact that the derived [ o / fe ] and o / na abundances vary with luminosity along the rgb of m@xmath1013 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , probably due to rotation - driven deep mixing , while such correlations are not seen in m@xmath103 giants ( @xcite , @xcite ) , may be telling us that cluster - to - cluster variations in the rotational properties of their stellar populations are large enough to have far - reaching ramifications .    as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "it is not at all clear whether the faintest hb stars in all of these clusters have close to the primordial helium abundance or a higher value of @xmath79 , and yet our adopted distance moduli are consistent with @xmath420 .",
    "the main difficulty with the assumption of a higher helium abundance is that the luminosity of the hb is _ very _ sensitive to @xmath79 ; consequently , the adoption of an appreciably higher @xmath79 would imply a significantly increased distance modulus and a younger age .",
    "however , this would lead to problems with the predicted and observed msto - to - rgb color differences .    indeed , it was necessary to postulate that m@xmath1013 stars have helium abundances ranging from @xmath420 to possibly 0.33 , with a mean value of @xmath421 , in order to obtain a sufficiently short distance modulus and a high enough age to reconcile its @xmath226 parameter with that of m@xmath103 _ and _ to explain the observed differences in their sgb slopes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig20 ] ) .",
    "if all of the m@xmath1013 stars had initial helium contents close to @xmath255 , the zahb - based distance modulus would have been @xmath422 , implying an age near 10.25 gyr , and the overall fit to the observed cmd would have been considerably less agreeable .",
    "thus , we were lead to a scenario in which most ( all ? ) of the stars in some gcs ( m@xmath103 and lower - mass systems that have similar sgb morphologies ) have  normal \" helium abundances , while others ( m@xmath1013 and gcs that share its cmd characteristics ) have a higher @xmath79 _ in the mean _ , but which still contain a significant population of stars with @xmath423 . on the other hand , if the faintest hb stars in m@xmath1013 stars have @xmath420 , why are they so much bluer than their counterparts in m@xmath103",
    "? clearly something is missing in our understanding .",
    "( if both clusters have nearly the same age , as we and mf09 have concluded , and very similar cno abundances , differences in the stellar rotation rates would appear to be the next most plausible explanation for their different hb types . )",
    "another important issue is the extent to which the c@xmath166n@xmath166o abundances vary , both from cluster - to - cluster and from star - to - star within each gc .",
    "with relatively few exceptions ( e.g. , ngc@xmath101851 , see @xcite ) , spectroscopic studies have found little or no variation in the total cno abundance within gcs , though it is expected that any significant enhancement in @xmath79 will be accompanied by increased cno abundances if mass loss from intermediate - mass agb stars is the origin of the helium - enriched gas ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "no allowance has been made in this study for such a correlation , even though turnoff luminosity versus age relations for metal - poor stars depend almost entirely on the absolute c@xmath166n@xmath166o abundance ( see vbd12 ) , because it is not known at the present time whether the observed luminosity widths of the sgbs in clusters that have thick subgiant branches is caused by variations in cno or age ( or both ) .",
    "the most obvious way of explaining why , for instance , m@xmath1015 has a much redder hb than m@xmath1092 or m@xmath1030 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] ) , despite all three clusters having nearly identical [ fe / h ] values , is that the former has higher [ cno / fe ] than the latter since increased cno abundances have the effect of driving hb models to lower effective temperatures ( and hence redder colors ) , with minimal effects on their luminosities ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then m@xmath1015 should be somewhat younger than m@xmath1092 and m@xmath1030 , assuming that all of the other parameters which affect age determinations are left unchanged .",
    "fortunately , the predicted mean luminosity ( but not the slope ) of the sgb at a fixed age is essentially independent of @xmath79 , but to disentangle the age and abundance effects , large spectroscopic surveys of the cluster subgiant populations will be required .",
    "however , perhaps the best way of getting a handle on the chemistry of gcs is to search for and identify eclipsing binary members because they can provide tight contraints on the masses and radii of stars at their locations in observed cmds , as well as on their distances if accurate and precise estimates of their temperatures can be derived .",
    "such work should be given very strong support : this avenue of research is likely to lead to the biggest improvement in our understanding of gcs during the next few years .",
    "( a good example of the value and importance of such studies is provided by the binary v69 in 47 tuc , which provides a compelling case against the possibility that , as found by mf09 , this [ fe / h ] @xmath215 cluster is coeval with the most metal - deficient gcs . )    the most unanticipated result of this study is the discovery that the most metal - poor gcs ( those with [ fe / h ] @xmath424 ) can be divided into two groups on the basis of differences in their sgb morphologies . that nearly the same separation is obtained between clusters that , _ at the present time _ , are able , or unable , to retain the gas which is lost via normal mass - loss processes through the development of gc winds or which are subject to ram - pressure stripping by the halo interstellar medium is especially surprising .",
    "how is it possible that the gas - retention properties of present - day gcs discriminate so well between those systems that show the strongest evidence for multiple stellar populations ( specifically a significantly higher @xmath79 ) and those for which the tightness of the cmd appears to imply little or no variations in @xmath79 , [ cno / fe ] , or age ?",
    "this may be telling us that the masses of gcs have not changed by a large factor during their lifetimes . if all clusters formed with @xmath10625 times their present masses ( as predicted by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , surely the cluster - to - cluster variations in mass loss that occured since their formation due to 2-body and tidal interactions , which depend on the orbit and various cluster properties , would have been large enough that the separation of the m@xmath103-like and m@xmath1013-like clusters would not have been so clear - cut .",
    "some support for a much reduced mass loss over the lifetimes of gcs to date is provided by the recent work of @xcite , who found that the globular clusters in fornax , which show very similar variations of light - element abundances as those seen in galactic gcs , contain 2025% of all of the stars in this dwarf galaxy that have [ fe / h ] @xmath425 .",
    "even if all of the field stars that satisfy this inequality came from the clusters , the latter could not have been more massive than 45 times their present masses .",
    "although this result may be complicated by the issue of whether or not fornax is the result of a merger of two dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , initial - to - final mass ratios of @xmath426 are also suggested by the results of @xmath16-body simulations that attempt to model how an assumed initial mass function ( imf ) would have been altered over the evolutionary history of a cluster through the evaporation of low - mass stars and the effects of tidal interactions with the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , it seems that the present - day mfs can be reproduced quite well if all clusters have the same imf , which is suggested to be the case by the work of @xcite .",
    "in addition , the great difficulty of finding halo field stars with low oxygen and high sodium abundances is hard to understand if gcs have lost at least 9095% of their masses over the past 1113 gyr . while ramrez et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have reported the discovery of two such dwarfs , those stars have low @xmath21-element abundances ( see their fig .  1 ) , which are not typical of gc stars .",
    "where are the field halo stars with high @xmath21/fe ratios and low oxygen abundances ?",
    "this is clearly less of a problem if gcs were initially much less massive than many studies have proposed .",
    "inferences concerning the existence of significant populations of second - generation stars in gcs from the morphology of the horizontal branch  in particular , from the length of the blue hb or the existence of gaps along this feature ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite )  are quite speculative as well , though it is possible to differentiate between sub - populations on the hb using @xmath167 photometry ( @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this is demonstrated by the work of @xcite who suggested that m@xmath1053 consists primarily of first - generation stars because ( i ) it has quite a stubby blue hb for its metallicity , and ( ii ) @xcite proposed that one way of understanding the small range in the observed c and n abundances in this cluster is that the polluting gas had not been processed through the full cno - cycle , in which case the ne - na cycle would not have been operative either . as a consequence , caloi &",
    "dantona predicted that stars in this sytem would not show the o ",
    "na anticorrelation .",
    "we do not know if the necessary observations have been carried out to test this prediction , but we suspect that an o  na anticorrelation will be found because its presence has been reported in stars belonging to m@xmath1055 ( @xcite ) , which have nearly the same [ fe / h ] as their counterparts in m@xmath1053 and , what is especially noteworthy , even more uniform cn band strengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "both martell et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and briley et al",
    ".  suggest that this can be explained if deep mixing has produced low c / fe ratios in bright giants of both clusters",
    ". this could well be the explanation given that a decline in the carbon abundance with increasing luminosity along the upper rgb has been observed in a number of moderate to very metal - deficient clusters , including m@xmath1092 ( @xcite ) , m@xmath1015 ( @xcite ) , and m@xmath104 and ngc@xmath106752 ( @xcite ) , among others .",
    "in the case of m@xmath1013 , even the oxygen abundance appears to follow a similar trend ( @xcite ) .",
    "this raises the possibility that deep mixing also plays a role in the observed o  na anticorrelations , which are seen in ,",
    "e.g. , the lowest metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath427 ) stars in @xmath161cen ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* also see @xcite ) , current models for the agb phase and for rapidly rotating massive stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) are not able to reproduce the observed abundance patterns in a fully satisfactory and consistent way .",
    "although it may turn out that better agreement will be obtained when some of the many parameters that affect the models are fine - tuned , these difficulties ( coupled with those mentioned above ) may instead be telling us that the scenario which has been developed over the past few years , requiring very high initial gc masses , among other things , is incorrect .",
    "in particular , it is still within the realm of possibility that most of the light - element variations that are observed were present in the gas out of which the observed generation(s ) of cluster stars formed ( see @xcite ) ; i.e. , that they arose at earlier times in the evolution of protoclusters . as is widely appreciated , there are problems and inconsistencies with every proposal that has been made to date  which is , of course , the reason why a satisfactory solution has not yet been found despite a tremendous effort by many researchers .",
