    "amongst the brightest objects in the x - ray sky are the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , exotic systems where the primary is a compact object ( either a neutron star or black hole ) and the secondary a low - mass ( @xmath61@xmath7 ) star . since the secondary is overflowing its roche - lobe , matter is accreted via an accretion disk onto the compact object , giving rise to the observed x - rays . the majority of these lmxbs , the so - called x - ray transients , only show sporadic x - ray activity , but most of the time remain in a state of low - level activity , referred to as quiescence ( see e.g. psaltis 2006 for an overview and more detailed references ) .",
    "due to reprocessing of the x - rays , mainly in the outer accretion disk , a lmxb also becomes much brighter in the optical during a transient outburst ( e.g. charles & coe 2006 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this reprocessed emission completely dominates the optical light , making radial velocity studies using spectral features from the donor star impossible in most cases , while during their quiescent state most transients become too faint for such studies",
    ". a powerful alternative method of investigation was opened when steeghs & casares ( 2002 ) detected narrow emission line components that originated from the irradiated face of the donor star in scox-1 .",
    "these narrow features were most obvious in the bowen blend ( niii @xmath84634/4640 and ciii @xmath84647/4650 ) , which is the result of uv fluorescence from the hot inner disk , and gave rise to the first radial velocity curve of the mass donor in sco x-1 . thus far ,",
    "high resolution phase - resolved spectroscopic studies have revealed these narrow lines in more than a dozen optically bright lmxbs , including several transients during their outburst , leading ( for most of them ) to the first constraint on the mass of the compact object ( see cornelisse et  al .",
    "2008 for an overview ) .    on january 11 2011 the x - ray transient maxij0556@xmath0332 ( hereafter maxij0556 ) was newly discovered by maxi / gsc ( matsumura et  al .",
    "2011 ) , and quickly thereafter localized by the swift x - ray telescope ( kennea et  al .",
    "eclipse - like features in the x - ray light - curves led to several possible orbital periods ( strohmayer 2011 , maitra et  al .",
    "although follow - up x - ray observations excluded all except one ( 9.33 hr ) of these periods ( belloni et  al .",
    "2011 ) , further observations were also able to discard this period ( belloni private communication ) .",
    "the optical counterpart was quickly confirmed by halpern ( 2011 ) as an @xmath9@xmath317.8 object , making it an excellent target for high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "initial studies of the x - ray spectral and timing variations were unable to indicate the nature of the compact object in maxij0556 ( belloni et  al .",
    "2011 ) , but more detailed studies by homan et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) suggest that its behavior is similar to some of the neutron stars at high accretion rates ( the so - called z - sources ) . together with its optical and radio properties",
    "this strongly suggests that maxij0556 harbors a neutron star ( russell et  al .",
    "2011 ; coriat et  al .",
    "2011 ) .    in order to identify the nature of maxij0556 using the narrow components in the bowen region we triggered our target of opportunity ( too ) observations using fors 2 on the very large telescope ( vlt ) and complemented it with directors discretionary time ( ddt ) using x - shooter , which is also on the vlt . in this paper",
    "we present the results of these observations .",
    "in sect.2 we discuss the observations in detail , and in sect.3 we show the results .",
    "we finish with a discussion in sect.4 and present further evidence that maxij0556 is most likely a neutron star lmxb .",
    ".observation log of maxij0556 . indicated are the observing dates and times , instrument used ( setting ) , integration time for each spectrum ( int . ) , number of spectra obtained during each night ( no , ) and the variation of the seeing during these observations ( as measured by the dimm on paranal ) .",
    "[ obs ] [ cols=\"^,^,<,<,^ , < \" , ]     if the narrow components truly trace the irradiated companion we thereby obtain a lower limit to the mass - function of @xmath10@xmath11=@xmath12sin@xmath13/(1+@xmath2)@xmath14@xmath150.07@xmath7 ( for @xmath16=0.68 day ) or @xmath150.04@xmath7 ( for @xmath17=0.41 day ) , where @xmath18 is the inclination and @xmath2(=@xmath12/@xmath19 ) is the mass ratio .",
    "these mass functions are true lower - limits , since the lines should trace the radial velocity of the surface and not the center of mass of the donor star , and its true orbital velocity ( @xmath4 ) should therefore always be higher ( muoz - darias et  al .",
    "2005 ) .    one way we could further constrain the system parameters is by taking account of the x - ray properties of maxij0556 , and in particular the reported eclipse - like features ( strohmayer 2011 ; maitra et  al .",
    "strohmayer ( 2011 ) reported that the eclipse was not total , nor `` sharp '' , as might be expected if the x - ray source is obscured by the donor star .",
    "belloni ( private communication ) confirmed this and suggested that these features more resemble dips , as are also observed in the high inclination system 4u1254@xmath069 ( e.g. diaz - trigo 2009 ) . in 4u1254@xmath069 these dips",
    "are thought to be caused by obscuration of the central x - ray source by the outer accretion disk edge , and the depth and strength strongly varies ( sometimes the dips are even completely absent ) .",
    "diaz - trigo ( 2009 ) suggested the presence of a tilted / precessing accretion disk in 4u1254@xmath069 and if something similar is present in maxij0556 it implies a relatively high inclination .",
    "the presence of such a tilted / precessing accretion disk would make maxij0556 similar to the dwarf novae that show superhumps , and could also explain why neither of our two potential orbital periods is close to any period suggested by the x - ray dips ( strohmayer 2011 ) .",
    "superhumps are commonly observed in dwarf novae during a superoutburst ( see e.g. patterson et  al .",
    "2005 for an overview ) , and are thought to be caused by an instability at the 3:1 resonance that forces the eccentric accretion disk to precess ( e.g. whitehurst 1988 ) . due to these deformations of the disk shape the photometric period in dwarf novae is typically a few percent longer than the orbital period , although superhump periods shorter than the orbital period have also been observed if the precessing disk is counter - rotating ( patterson et  al .",
    "2002 ) .    assuming that maxij0556 is a high inclination system ( but not high enough for the donor to obscure the x - ray source ) with a precessing accretion disk that sometimes partly obscures the central x - ray source",
    ", we can try to further constrain its system parameters .",
    "first of all , one of the original reported periods by strohmayer ( 2011 ) must then be the superhump period .",
    "if the orbital period is 0.68 days ( 16 hrs ) the superhump period would most likely be 0.58 days .",
    "following patterson et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , this would lead to an observed fractional period excess of @xmath20=0.14 and suggests a mass ratio of @xmath2@xmath30.45 .",
    "we note that this mass ratio is high for systems that typically show precession . however , osaki ( 2005 ) pointed out that sufficiently hot accretion disks may expand beyond the 3:1 resonance radius and start precessing . since maxij0556 is thought to be a z - source and should have accretion rates close to eddington ( homan et  al .",
    "2011 ) , therefore it might be reasonable to expect a such hot accretion disk and therefore precession .    using @xmath2=0.45",
    "we can correct the velocity of the irradiated surface ( our observed @xmath21 of 104 km s@xmath5 ) to the center of mass velocity of the donor star using the @xmath22-correction developed by muoz - darias et  al .",
    "this would lead to a maximum @xmath4 velocity of 190 km s@xmath5 ( for a disk with an opening angle of 0@xmath23 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2=0.45 suggests that eclipses by the secondary will occur for an inclination @xmath1572@xmath24 ( paczynski 1974 ) , and we use this as a first estimate of the inclination .",
    "combining all these system parameters we obtain a mass for the compact object of @xmath31.2@xmath7 , which is close to the canonical 1.4@xmath7 neutron star mass .",
    "we therefore believe that for a disk opening angle @xmath36@xmath24 and a relatively high inclination it is also possible to obtain a 1.2 - 1.4@xmath7 compact object .    given the system parameters above",
    ", we would need an inclination of @xmath340@xmath24 to obtain a black hole with a mass of 3.2@xmath7 .",
    "this is too low to realistically expect any dipping behavior .    for an orbital period of 0.4 days ( with a superhump period of 9.33 hrs ) , and making the same assumptions as above , we would obtain a mass for the compact object of @xmath30.2@xmath7 . again , this would lead to unrealistically low inclinations to obtain any sensible compact object mass .",
    "we therefore think that our data are most consistent with a neutron star lmxb in a 0.68 days orbit and being observed at moderately high inclination .",
    "we have presented the results of a spectroscopic campaign on the x - ray transient maxij0556 close to peak of outburst and have shown that strong niii emission lines are present in the spectrum , while c and o show no enhancement .",
    "this is in agreement with maitra et  al .",
    "( 2011b ) who have suggested an unusually high n / o abundance .",
    "furthermore , all emission lines show a continuing decay over the @xmath3one month of our observations , for which we have no good explanation .    our radial velocity study has shown that only two orbital periods ( 0.68 and 0.41 days ) are possible . from our dataset",
    "only we can not distinguish the true orbital period so both periods are equally likely .",
    "we suggest that maxij0556 harbors a precessing accretion disk to explain not only the disappearance of the dip - like features observed in x - rays , but also the discrepancy between the periods suggested by strohmayer ( 2011 ) and ourselves .",
    "if the presence of a precessing accretion disk can be proved , then the x - ray dips suggest not only a reasonably high inclination but also that the longer period is most likely the true orbital period .",
    "this would imply that the compact object is a neutron star , strengthening the suggestion of homan et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "since a superhump is usually not observed when a system is in quiescence , the scenario outlined above can only be confirmed with photometric observations obtained during a future outburst .",
    "finding the true orbital period on the other hand can be obtained by observing maxij0556 when it is back in quiescence . with a quiescent optical magnitude of @xmath9@xmath320 , it is easily accessible for both photometric and spectroscopic studies with medium - sized telescopes .",
    "such studies would not only constrain the true orbital period and the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the center of mass of the donor star ( instead of its irradiated surface ) , but hopefully constrain the inclination and binary mass ratio .",
    "this would offer solid dynamical constraints on the masses of the binary components , in order to verify that maxij0556 indeed harbors a neutron star and more accurately determine its mass .",
    "this work is based on data collected at the european southern observatory paranal , chile [ obs.ids .",
