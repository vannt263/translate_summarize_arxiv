    "there has been much recent interest in homotopical approaches to categories , and due to the development of dendroidal sets by moerdijk and weiss in @xcite , some of this work is being extended to give homotopical approaches to multicategories , better known as colored operads . rather than simplicial categories , or categories enriched in simplicial sets , one can instead consider colored operads in simplicial sets .",
    "other models for so - called @xmath0-categories are described by simplicial diagrams of either sets or spaces ; replacing the simplicial indexing category @xmath1 with the dendroidal category @xmath2 results in models for @xmath3-operads .",
    "these models and the comparisons between them , in the form of quillen equivalences of model categories , are being developed in work of cisinski and moerdijk @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the world of @xmath3-categories ,",
    "a beginning step in the comparison between simplicial categories and segal categories , which can be thought of as up - to - homotopy nerves of simplicial categories , was the single - object case : the comparison between simplicial monoids and segal monoids .",
    "this result of the first - named author was extended to the case of simplicial categories and segal categories with a given fixed object set , which then played a role in the proof of the general case @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the proof was that simplicial monoids can be regarded as product - preserving functors from the algebraic theory of monoids @xmath4 to the category of simplicial sets ; finding an equivalence with certain kinds of diagrams from @xmath5 to the category of simplicial sets was , in a sense , replacing @xmath4 with a simpler diagram that served the same purpose .",
    "in the general case of simplicial colored operads and segal colored operads , the equivalence given by cisinski and moerdijk did not use the same methods .",
    "however , it is still true that ordinary ( single - colored ) simplicial operads can be regarded as product - preserving functors from an appropriate theory to the category of simplicial sets , and likewise for the category of simplicial operads with a fixed color set @xcite .",
    "the first main result of this paper is to give an explicit quillen equivalence in this case , making use of the machinery of algebraic theories .",
    "the model category structure for segal operads is quillen equivalent to the model category of simplicial operads .",
    "this result was already proved in @xcite by restricting the general case , but our use of the algebraic theory framework gives a different approach .",
    "the second main result , whose proof follows from the same methods , is a comparison of simplicial operads with a group action and segal operads with the analogous group action .",
    "there are two ways to approach this situation , and we give a proof for each one . in the first , we consider simplicial operads equipped with an action of a fixed discrete group @xmath6 . in the second , we look at simplicial operads equipped with an action of a simplicial group , where the group in question can vary .",
    "let @xmath6 be a discrete group .",
    "the model category structure for segal operads with a @xmath6-action is quillen equivalent to the model category of simplicial operads with a @xmath6-action .",
    "the model category structure for segal operads with a simplicial group action is quillen equivalent to the model category of simplicial operads with a simplicial group action .    after a background section ,",
    "we establish some model category structures for reduced dendroidal spaces .",
    "we then prove that those which are local with respect to a segal condition are equivalent to simplicial operads , viewed as algebras over the theory of operads .",
    "from there , we consider the two different theories for groups acting on operads and find simpler diagrams , as developed in @xcite , which we prove encodes the same structure .",
    "the paper concludes with technical results which are used in earlier sections .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of some of the main objects of study in this paper , namely dendroidal sets and algebras over multi - sorted algebraic theories , as well as the model category framework in which we investigate them .",
    "recall that an _ operad _ in simplicial sets is a sequence @xmath7 of simplicial sets , each with a right action of the symmetric group @xmath8 , a unit element @xmath9 , and operations @xmath10 satisfying associativity , unit , and equivariance conditions @xcite .",
    "more generally , one can look at _ colored operads _ , in which inputs and outputs for each operation have designated labels , and composition respects these labels @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , a colored operad in simplicial sets is the same as a symmetric simplicial _ multicategory _ , in which morphisms have a single target but possibly multiple ( or no ) inputs .",
    "we reserve the word  operad \" to mean a colored operad with a single color , i.e. , an ordinary operad , and write @xmath11 for the category of operads .",
    "we write @xmath12 for the category of colored operads .",
    "recall that @xmath1 denotes the category of finite ordered sets and order - preserving maps between them .",
    "there is a close relationship between simplicial sets , or functors @xmath13 , and categories .",
    "we can think of the objects @xmath14 $ ] of @xmath1 as categories with @xmath15 objects and a single morphism @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "the nerve of a category @xmath18 is defined to be the simplicial set whose @xmath19-simplices are given by the set @xmath20 , \\mathcal c)$ ] .",
    "the idea behind dendroidal sets is to find a generalization of the category @xmath1 suitable for working with colored operads rather than categories .",
    "the objects of this category are given by certain kinds of trees .    by  tree \" , we mean a non - planar graph with no cycles , where some edges may touch only one vertex .",
    "a tree must have at least one such edge , specified as the _ root _ ; any others the tree might have are called _",
    "leaves_. the data of the tree consists of both the graph and the choice of root . as an example , for @xmath21 , the _ corolla _ @xmath22 is the tree with one vertex and @xmath15 edges , one of which is specified as the root .",
    "the root determines a direction to the tree , where the leaves are regarded as inputs and the root is regarded as the output . consequently , every vertex @xmath23 has _ incoming edges _ , whose number is given by @xmath24 , the _ valence _ of the vertex , as well as one _ outgoing edge _",
    ", which is the one in the direction of the root . for a tree @xmath25 ,",
    "the set of vertices @xmath26 is actually a _ set with valences _ , namely the set @xmath26 together with a function @xmath27 .",

    "a tree @xmath25 determines a free colored operad as follows .",
    "the set of colors is just the set of edges @xmath28 , and we have one generator for each vertex @xmath29 . choosing an order for the incoming edges @xmath30 , the generator @xmath23 is in @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the outgoing edge of @xmath23 .",
    "we call this colored operad @xmath25 as well ; the isomorphism class does not depend on our choice of planar structure .",
    "( this colored operad is called @xmath33 in @xcite . )    notice that the colored operad @xmath25 is actually quite small despite being free . the fact that each edge has a distinct color forces all of the generated compositions to come from contracting internal edges of @xmath25 .",
    "the category @xmath2 , defined as the full subcategory of the category of colored operads with objects the free colored operads generated by trees , is the desired analogue of @xmath1 for operads . as for @xmath1",
    ", we assume that we are working in some chosen skeletal subcategory of @xmath2 ; in particular , we always regard @xmath34 as a set .",
    "notice that if @xmath35 is a morphism of @xmath2 , and @xmath25 is linear , then @xmath36 is linear as well .",
