    "akari is an infrared space telescope , which was launched in february 2006 , in order to carry out all sky survey at mid- to far - infrared ( @xcite ; nakagawa 2001 , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the all sky survey , akari is capable of making pointed observations at near- to far - infrared . because of the nature of the sun - synchronous polar orbit , north and south ecliptic polar regions ( nep and sep , hereafter ) have very good visibility so that repeated exposures are possible . in particular ,",
    "an extragalactic survey of the nep region has been designed to perform the deep imaging of pre - selected blank field from 2.5 to 26 @xmath0 m in order to study the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "more details of the deep extragalactic nep survey ( hereafter , nep - deep ) and its strategies can be found in matsuhara et al .",
    "currently , we are planning to release the nep survey data to public in 2008 , approximately one year after the completion of the survey .",
    "prior to the full , complete nep survey , mini surveys have been carried out in order to assess the capabilities of akari .",
    "one of them is an imaging survey called the nep - deep - early survey .",
    "the nep - deep - early field covers two fields of views , one with the mir - l camera ( l15 , l18w , and l24 bands ) , and another with the nir and the mir - s cameras with 6 bands covering 2.5 to 11 @xmath0 m , at the total accumulated on - source exposure time of 10 to 20 minutes using irc05 astronomical observation template ( aot ) ( onaka et al .",
    "the size of each field is roughly 10@xmath7 .",
    "the nir / mir - s part is covered by the cfht megaprime optical survey at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 bands ( hwang et al .",
    "other mini surveys include the nep monitor field survey taken with a different observing mode , and the akari / nep performance verification ( nep - pv ) field survey .",
    "the purpose of the current paper is to examine the properties of the infrared sources detected in the nir / mir - s part of the nep - deep - early survey field .",
    "while other survey fields provide a wider wavelength coverage ( the nep monitor field survey ) or different wavelength information ( l15 ; nep - pv survey ) , the nep - deep - early field data can provide with the complementary information regarding the nature of infrared sources expected in the nep wide survey which has a similar survey depth to this data set but with much wider areal coverage .",
    "analysis of an independent field also provides an opportunity to discover interesting rare sources .",
    "in particular , we will study in this paper , the nature of 11 @xmath0 m selected objects .",
    "related topics will be covered by other papers : detailed analysis of the monitor field data ( takagi et al .",
    "2007 ) , the optical identification of 15 @xmath0 m selected sources ( matsuhara et al .",
    "2007 ) , the source counts in n3 , s7 , and l15-bands ( wada et al .",
    "2007 ) , and x - ray sources in the nep survey data ( oyabu et al . 2007 ) .",
    "( 130 mm , 150mm)fig01.eps    among the six wavelength bands of the nep - deep - early survey data , the 11 @xmath0 m image has been used in the primary selection of the sample .",
    "the s11 passband samples the wavelength red - ward of the spitzer irac channel 4 ( 8 @xmath0 m ) from 8 @xmath0 m to 15 @xmath0 m , filling in a gap in the spitzer passbands . at 11 @xmath0 m",
    ", there is a strong silicate absorption in star forming galaxies at @xmath12 , but the s11 band is also where the strong pah features at 6.3 and 7.7 @xmath0 m redshift into at @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore , unlike source selections based on an 8 @xmath0 m band ( e.g. , the spitzer irac channel 4 ) , the 11 @xmath0 m sources are likely to be dominated by the star - forming galaxies at redshift in the range 0.2 @xmath1 0.7 .",
    "previous studies of ir luminous galaxies and star formation activities using the _ spitzer _ data have relied upon the extrapolation of the 8 micron and 24 micron bands , which can introduce a significant uncertainty in the estimate of ir luminosity . with the unique capability of the 11 @xmath0 m imaging of akari",
    ", we should be able to reduce such an uncertainty in understanding the ir activity of galaxies at moderate redshifts .",
    "other sources that can be found in the 11 @xmath0 m include active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and stars .    in this work ,",
    "we characterize properties of objects selected based upon this new wavelength regime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the immediately following section ,",
    "we describe the details of the nep - deep - early survey data set . in  3 , we present the results of the photometry on the data .",
    "the characteristics of the infrared sources in conjunction with other available data are discussed in detail in  4 .",
    "in addition to the 11 @xmath0 flux limited sample , we also find sources that need special attention based on the seds in other bands .",
    "such objects are discussed in  5 .",
    "the final section summarizes our main results . throughout this paper , we will use ab magnitude system which converts to @xmath0jy as abmag=@xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the nep - deep - early survey data have been taken during the early phase of the scientific observations that started in early may 2006 in order to assess the performance of the irc instrument ( onaka et al .",
    "the passbands covered by this mini survey are n2 , n3 , n4 , s7 , s9w , and s11 ( see @xcite for the detailed information on the designation of the filters ) .",
    "our field is centered on @xmath14 , @xmath15 with approximately @xmath16 field of view .",

    "the number count of s11 sources as a function of ab magnitude is shown in fig .",
    "the total count ( black histogram ) as well as the count for non - stellar objects only ( red histogram ) are shown together .",
    "the expected distribution of sources uniformly distributed over the sky in a non - expanding , euclidean universe is indicated as a straight line with slope of 0.6 .",
    "the observed source count peaks at around 19-th magnitude and declines afterward",
    ". clearly , we encounter the incompleteness effect beyond  19-th magnitude . in order to investigate the incompleteness in our sample , we created artificial objects that have a gaussian psf shape with the fwhm value of the point sources in the s11 image .",
    "we distributed them in less crowded parts of the s11 image and performed the source detection . from this exercise",
    ", we find that our source counts is nearly complete down to @xmath20 mag ( @xmath21% ) , while it drops to 50% level at 19.2 mag .",
    "our visual inspection of s11 image also confirms that the number of spurious sources increases as we go to @xmath22 mag .",
    "therefore , we consider a sample with @xmath23 mag to be highly complete and reliable , and use this sample of 72 objects to characterize the property of s11 sources .",
    "the ab magnitudes of our sample are listed in table 2 , together with our identifications regarding the type of the objects from the sed shape as well as the appearance of the object .",
    "we have classified our sources into 4 categories : stars , star forming galaxies , early type galaxies , and agns .",
    "we also add a supplemental sample made of sources fainter than @xmath24 mag , but have spectral energy distributions worth of special note .",
    "these sources are treated separately in  5 .",
    "we concentrate on the flux limited sample at 11 @xmath0 m in this section .",
    "( 130 mm , 150mm)fig03.eps      the s7-s11 versus n2-n4 color - color diagram of the 11 @xmath0 m flux limited sample is shown in fig .",
    "the sources identified as stars are indicated as asterisks while non - stellar sources are shown as filled dots with different sizes depending on the brightness .",
    "also shown in this diagram is the same color - color sequences of three typical nearby star forming galaxies m51 , m82 and arp 220 located at redshifts in the range between @xmath12 and 2.2 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that most of the s11 flux limited sources found in a shallow nep survey are likely to be star forming galaxies at low to medium redshifts . however , there are also redder sources in n2-n4 color index than star forming spiral galaxies",
    ". as we shall see , most of them are agn .",

    "5 . in near infrared ,",
    "the stellar seds are nearly that of rayleigh jeans tail of black body , and therefore stars lie in rather narrow range in this diagram . also shown as solid and dashed lines are locations of an @xmath25 galaxy having the sed shape of m51 and m82 , respectively , at different redshifts as marked on the lines .",
    "actual data points are consistent with the star forming disk galaxies lying within the redshift @xmath26 .",
    "again , the objects with very red color in n2-n4 are likely to be agns . such red objects are more easily distinguished in n2-n4 than n4-n3 .",
    "( 100 mm , 100mm)fig05.eps      so far we have been investigating the general properties of the 11 @xmath0 m selected sources .",
    "we now take a closer look at individual sources .",
    "based on the seds , we divide our sources into three categories : stars , galaxies , and agns .",
    "we identified galaxies from their spectral shapes , and their morphological appearances in the cfht image .",
    "the galaxies are further divided into star - forming galaxies and early type galaxies based on their sed shapes .",
    "the total number of objects identified as star forming galaxies is 50 , corresponding to about 70% of the total s11 selected sample , while only five objects are classified as early - types .",
    "6 shows seds of a representative set of star - forming galaxies at @xmath23 mag , as well as postage stamp images of these galaxies .",
    "the seds are matched with 100 sed templates ir luminous galaxies in chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) , using the bayesian photometric redshift code of benitez ( 2000 ) . by doing so , we obtain an estimate of photometric redshift as well as the best - fit sed template .",
    "infrared luminosity is then calculated by integrating the fluxes beyond the rest - frame 5 @xmath0 m of the best - fit sed template , and rescaling the value according to the luminosity distance .",
    "the best - fit sed template is plotted over the observed points in fig .",
    "6 , and we also indicate the photometric redshift in each panel . the probability distribution of photometric redshift is also given in the panel next to the sed plot . when performing the sed - fit , note that we have added photometric uncertainties of 10% for nir , 15% for s7 bands , and 20% for s9w and s11 bands in order to account for the uncertainties in different bands that we have found when fitting stellar spectra ( see section 4.3.3 ) .",
    "the star forming galaxies in general have seds that hump at the rest - frame 1.6 @xmath0 m , and also have strong mir emission in excess of the stellar light expected from the rayleigh - jeans tail of the black body radiation .",
    "6 demonstrates that the s9w and s11 data points are crucial for sampling the redshifted excess mir emission and the rest - frame 7.7 @xmath0 m and 6.2 @xmath0 m pah features for those located at @xmath27 .",
    "we expect that the majority of s11 or s9w selected sources in shallow surveys of akari would be star forming galaxies of this kind .",
    "7 shows the seds of all of the objects classified as star - forming galaxies which are brighter than 17.5 magnitude at s11 , except for the cases where akari fluxes are confused with their neighbors ( multiple sources ) . like the example seds given in fig . 6 ,",
    "the seds of 11 @xmath0 m selected galaxies can be characterized by a broad peak in near infrared and brightening at mid infrared .",
    "the mid infrared flux can be attributed mostly to the warm dust with pah emission features .",
    "the sed fitting to these objects shows that they have ir luminosity of order of @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath6 , in the regime of the lirgs .",
