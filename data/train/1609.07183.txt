    "in coding theory an interesting but at the same time a difficult problem is to determine the weight distribution of a given code .",
    "the weight distribution is important because it plays a significant role in determining the capabilities of error detection and correction of a code . for cyclic codes",
    "this problem is even more important because this kind of codes possess a rich algebraic structure . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that cyclic codes with few weights have a great practical importance in coding theory and cryptography , and this is so because they are useful in the design of frequency hopping sequences and in the development of secret sharing schemes .",
    "a characterization of a class of optimal three - weight cyclic codes of dimension 3 , over any finite field , was recently presented in @xcite , and almost immediately after this , a generalization for the sufficient numerical conditions of such characterization was given in @xcite . by means of this generalization",
    "it was found a class of optimal three - weight cyclic codes of dimension greater than or equal to 3 that includes the class of cyclic codes characterized in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to show that the numerical conditions that were found in @xcite are also necessary . as we will see later",
    ", an interesting feature of the present work is that , in clear contrast with @xcite and @xcite , we use some new and non - conventional methods in order to achieve our goals .",
    "more specifically , we will use the remainder operator ( see next section for a formal definition of it ) as one of the key tools of this work .",
    "in fact , through this remainder operator , we not only were able to extend the characterization in @xcite , but also present a less complex proof for such extended characterization , which avoids the use of some of the sophisticated but at the same time complex theorems ( for example the davenport - hasse theorem ) , that are the key arguments of the proofs given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , we were also able to present a simplified and self - contained proof of our extended characterization .",
    "as a further result , we also find the parameters for the dual code of any cyclic code in our extended characterization class . in fact , after the analysis of some examples , it seems that such dual codes always have the same parameters as the best known linear codes .    in order to provide a detailed explanation of what are the main results of this work ,",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be positive integers such that @xmath0 is a power of a prime number , and fix @xmath2 .",
    "also let @xmath3 be a fixed primitive element of @xmath4 .",
    "for any integer @xmath5 , denote by @xmath6 $ ] the minimal polynomial of @xmath7 . with this notation in mind , the following result gives a full description for the weight distribution of a class of optimal three - weight cyclic codes of length @xmath8 and dimension greater than or equal to 3 .",

    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the parity - check polynomials of two different one - weight irreducible cyclic codes of length @xmath8 , whose nonzero weights are , respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath9 is an optimal three - weight @xmath22 $ ] cyclic code over @xmath13 , with the weight distribution given in table i. in addition , if @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , is the number of words of weight @xmath25 in the dual code of @xmath9 , then @xmath26 , and + @xmath27 + thus , if @xmath28 , then this dual is a single - error - correcting code with parameters @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "since the previous reducible cyclic codes are optimal , a natural question that arises is whether there exist other cyclic codes ( reducible or irreducible , and apart from those in theorem [ teouno ] ) , whose weight distribution is given in table i. that is , we ask ourselves if the numerical conditions in theorem [ teouno ] , are also necessary .",
    "the answer is yes , and we formally state this result in the following :    [ teodos ] suppose @xmath10 , and let @xmath30 be a cyclic code of length @xmath8 over @xmath13 .",
    "then , the weight distribution of @xmath30 is given in table i if and only if its dimension is @xmath31 , and there exist two integers , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in such a way that @xmath14 is the parity - check polynomial of @xmath30 , and where these integers satisfy the two conditions : @xmath32 and @xmath16 .",
    "as can be seen , the previous result is the natural extension of the characterization given in theorem 5 of @xcite .",
    "now , note that the kind of characterizations that are given in terms of a weight distribution table are , in general , very difficult to establish .",
    "one of the most relevant efforts in that direction is the work of b. schmidt and c. white in @xcite , where simple necessary and sufficient numerical conditions for an irreducible cyclic code to have at most two weights , are presented . as will be clear later",
    ", this important work will be essential in order to present a formal proof of the extended characterization in theorem [ teodos ] .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ secdos ] we fix our notation , give some definitions , and establish the main assumption that must be considered throughout this work .",
    "in addition , we recall a characterization about the one - weight irreducible cyclic codes that will be useful .",
    "section [ sectres ] is devoted to recalling the griesmer lower bound , and also to presenting three preliminary results . in section [ seccuatro ]",
    "we study a kind of exponential sums that help us to determine the weights , and their corresponding frequencies , of the codes in theorem [ teouno ] .",
    "in fact , we are going to present simple necessary and sufficient numerical conditions in order that the evaluation of an exponential sum of such kind is exactly equal to one . in section [ seccinco ]",
    "we use the definitions and results of the previous sections in order to present a formal proof of the theorems [ teouno ] and [ teodos ] . after this",
    ", we will analyze the two easy - to - check necessary and sufficient numerical conditions of theorem [ teodos ] in order to give an explicit formula for the number of cyclic codes that satisfy such conditions .",
    "in addition we include , at the end of this section , some examples of theorems [ teouno ] and [ teodos ] , as well as for such explicit formula .",
    "finally , section [ secseis ] is devoted to presenting our conclusions .",
    "first of all we set for this section and the rest of this work , the following :    * notation . * by using @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath33 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we will denote five integers such that @xmath0 is the power of a prime number , @xmath1 is a positive integer , and @xmath34 . from now on",

    "a common integer operator in programming languages is the remainder , or modulus operator .",
    "this operator is commonly denoted as  @xmath39 \" , and it is interesting to note that it is rarely used in mathematics , and this is so because the remainder of a division of two integers is commonly handled by means of the usual congruence relation among integer numbers . however , as we will see , this remainder operator will be especially important for this work , and therefore a formal definition of it is needed .",

[ ejeuno ] with our notation , let @xmath287 and @xmath288 . then , owing to corollary [ cordos ] , the total number of different cyclic codes of length @xmath289 , over @xmath290 , and dimension @xmath291 , with weight enumerator polynomial @xmath292 , is @xmath293 .",

    "however , most of the conventional methods employed for the weight distribution computations require the use of , for example , gauss and/or jacobi sums along with very sophisticated but at the same time complex theorems ( for example the davenport - hasse theorem ) . in this work we used some new and non - conventional methods in order to extend a characterization for the weight distribution of a class of three - weight cyclic codes of dimension 3 , to a characterization for the weight distribution of a class of three - weight cyclic codes of dimension greater than or equal to 3 , that includes the first characterized class . more specifically , we used the remainder operator , which is quite common in programming languages , in order to show that the numerical conditions given in theorem 11 of @xcite are also necessary , and as a consequence of this , we were able to upgrade such theorem to an extended characterization ( theorems [ teouno ] and [ teodos ] ) that includes the characterization given in @xcite . furthermore , we would like to emphasize that by using the remainder operator , we were also able to present a simplified and self - contained proof of our extended characterization",
    ". finally , we also found the parameters for the dual code of any cyclic code in our extended characterization class , and after the analysis of some examples , it seems that such dual codes always have the same parameters as the best known linear codes ."
