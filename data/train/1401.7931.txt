    "the three dimensional cube @xmath20 and the petersen graph @xmath21 are both known to be path - pairable .",
    "the graph shown in figure 1 is the only path - pairable graph with maximum degree 3 on 12 or more vertices .",
    "apart from such small and rather sporadic examples we only know few path - pairable families . certainly , the complete graph @xmath22 on @xmath23 vertices is path - pairable .",
    "it can be proved easily that the complete bipartite graph @xmath24 is path - pairable as long as @xmath25 is even and @xmath26 .",
    "particular species of the latter family , the star graphs @xmath27 show that path - pairability is achievable even in the presence of vertices of small degrees .",
    "they also illustrate that vertices of large degrees are easily accessible transfer stations to carry out linking in the graphs without much effort . that motivates the study of @xmath3-path - pairable and path - pairable graphs with small maximum degree .",
    "faudree , gyrfs and lehel @xcite gave examples of @xmath3-path - pairable graphs for every @xmath28 with maximum degree 3 .",

    "one can prove that the cube @xmath20 is path - pairable , the question for higher odd - dimensions has yet to be answered ( it was proved in @xcite that @xmath41 is not path - pairable for @xmath2 even ) .",
    "[ q ] the @xmath44-dimensional hypercube @xmath45 is path - pairable for all @xmath28 .    a common attribute of the known path - pairable graphs is their small diameter . for each pair @xmath46 of terminals in the examples above , the length of the shortest @xmath47 paths is at most 3 .",
    "while terminal pairs of an actual pairing may not always be joined by shortest paths , small diameter gives the advantage of quick accessibility of the vertices and makes designation of edge - disjoint paths easier .",
    "the question concerning the existence of an infinite family of path - pairable graphs with unbounded diameter naturally arises .",

    "we accomplish the linking of the pairs in two phases . during the first phase , for each pair of terminals",
    ", we define a path that starts at one of the terminals and ends at some vertex in the class of its pair . if the ending vertex happens to be the actual pair of the terminal , we set this path as the joining path for the given pair , otherwise we continue with the second phase .",
    "if two terminals initially belong to the same class , then the pair simply skips the first phase of the linking .",
    "direct our cycle @xmath63 and the blown - up graph @xmath4 counterclockwise and label each pair @xmath47 such that there exists a directed @xmath64 path of length at most @xmath12 .",
    "we start building the above mentioned path for pair @xmath46 at vertex @xmath59 .",
    "fix @xmath12 edge - disjoint matchings @xmath65 of size @xmath66 between every consecutive classes @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for",

    "apparently , @xmath60 and @xmath80 belong to the same class .",
    "phase one ends by assigning a path @xmath81 to each @xmath46 pair of terminals .",
    "observe that paths @xmath21 and @xmath82 assigned to and starting at terminals @xmath59 and @xmath83 of the same class do not contain a common vertex as they are given edges of the same matchings in every step .",
    "now assume that edge @xmath84 has been utilized by two paths @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "it means that @xmath87 for some @xmath88 and that @xmath85 and @xmath86 must have started in the same class .",
    "however , in order to share an edge they also have to share a vertex which contradicts our previous observation .",
    "it proves that phase one terminates without edge - collision .",
    "in phase two we finish the linking . for the terminal @xmath60 initially paired with @xmath59 and for the endpoint @xmath80 of the path @xmath89 ( both vertices lying in @xmath67 for some @xmath90 ) consider the yet unused edges of the bipartite subgraph @xmath91 spanned by @xmath67 and @xmath68 . as @xmath92",
    ", there exists at least @xmath93 different vertices @xmath94 such that @xmath95 .",
    "observe that any vertex in @xmath67 is an endpoint of at most @xmath96 paths defined in phase one , hence out of the @xmath97 listed candidates at most @xmath98 could have been assigned to another pair @xmath99 .",
    "it means @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be joined by the path @xmath100 with an appropriate choice of @xmath101 from the list above .",

    "note that there is no edge between any @xmath67 and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) classes unless they are consecutive , that is , @xmath111 .",
    "also , we may assume without loss of generality that vertices belonging to consecutive @xmath67 sets are joined by an egde ( adding edges between consecutive classes changes neither the diameter nor the path - pairability property of the graph ) .",
    "if @xmath112 contains vertices in addition to @xmath60 , move them to @xmath113 by joining them to every vertex of @xmath114 as well as to @xmath60 in case they were not adjacent .",

    "note again that , while our operation may change the distribution of the vertices among the @xmath67 classes , our newly obtained graph @xmath118 has the same diameter as @xmath4 and is also path - pairable .",
    "we could even assume every @xmath67 class to be a complete graph ( by adding the necessary edges ) without changing the mentioned properties , though this would be a rather cosmetic operation that would simplify the structure of the graph but would not essentially contribute to the proof .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath119 for @xmath120 and divide our sets into three parts creating left , middle and right segments @xmath121 and @xmath122 as follows :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our main goal is to give a lower estimate on the size of @xmath123 .",
    "we first prove the following lemmas :    [ l ] @xmath124 as long as @xmath125 .",

    "apparently , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "observe that the number of edges between @xmath128 and @xmath129 is at least @xmath130 . indeed , placing @xmath131 terminals in @xmath132 and their pairs in @xmath133 there must be space for at least @xmath131 edge - disjoint paths passing from @xmath128 to @xmath129 . by induction hypothesis @xmath134 while the number of edges between the two classes is at most @xmath135 .",
