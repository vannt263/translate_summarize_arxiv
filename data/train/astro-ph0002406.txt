    "polaris ( @xmath0 ursae minoris , hr 424 , hd 8890 , ads 1477 , fk 907 , hip 11767 ) is a very interesting and important object , both from the astrophysical point of view and from the astrometric one . for astrophysics ,",
    "the most remarkable feature of the multiple stellar system polaris is the fact that its main component , namely @xmath0 umi a , is a cepheid variable with a very unusual behaviour . in astrometry , polaris is one of the most frequently and accurately observed objects , mainly because it is located so close to the north celestial pole and can be used for calibration purposes .    up to now",
    ", the binary nature of polaris was essentially neglected in ground - based fundamental astrometry , e.g in the fk5 ( fricke et al .",
    "this was justified by the limited accuracy reached by the meridian - circle observations .",
    "now , the high - precision astrometric measurements carried out with the hipparcos satellite ( esa 1997 ) require strongly to take into account the binary nature of polaris in order to obtain an adequate astrometric description of @xmath0 umi .",
    "similar procedures are required for many other binaries among the fundamental stars in order to be included properly into the sixth catalogue of fundamental stars ( fk6 ; part i : wielen et al .",
    "1999c ; see also wielen et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to obtain a reliable astrometric orbit for polaris , and to use this astrometric orbit for obtaining high - precision values for the position and proper motion of polaris .",
    "this is done by combining the known spectroscopic orbit of polaris with ground - based astrometric data given in the fk5 and with the hipparcos results .",
    "before doing so in the sects . 3 and 4 , we present in sect .",
    "2 an overview of the polaris system .",
    "polaris is a multiple stellar system , which consists of a close pair , @xmath0 umi a and @xmath0 umi p (= @xmath0 umi a ) , and a distant companion , @xmath0 umi b , and two distant components , @xmath0 umi c and @xmath0 umi d. we use here the designation p for a close companion of a , which was used in the ids and was adopted by the ccdm and by the hipparcos input catalogue , rather than the traditional version a , which is used e.g. by the wds and by chara ) .      the main component of polaris is a low - amplitude cepheid with a pulsational period of about 3.97 days .",
    "this period is increasing with time ( e.g. kamper & fernie 1998 ) . according to feast & catchpole ( 1997 ) ,",
    "@xmath0 umi a is a first - overtone pulsator ( rather than a fundamental one ) , since @xmath0 umi a is too luminous for a fundamental pulsator , if they apply their period - luminosity relation ( for fundamental pulsators ) to polaris .",
    "the fundamental period of @xmath0 umi a would follow as @xmath6 days , if the observed period is the first - overtone period @xmath7 ( using the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 derived by alcock et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for galactic cepheids ) .",
    "an extraordinary property of @xmath0 umi a among the cepheids is that the amplitude of its pulsation has been dramatically declined during the past 100 years , as seen both in the light curve and in the radial - velocity curve ( arellano ferro 1983 , kamper & fernie 1998 , and other references given therein ) .",
    "the full amplitude was about 0.@xmath912 in @xmath10 and about 6 km / s in radial velocity before 1900 , and seems now to be rather constant at a level of only 0.@xmath903 in @xmath10 and at 1.6 km / s in radial velocity .",
    "an earlier prediction ( fernie et al . 1993 ) that the pulsation should cease totally in the 1990s was invalid .",
    "a discussion of the hipparcos parallax and of the absolute magnitude of @xmath0 umi a is given in the next sect .",
    "the cepheid @xmath0 umi a is a member of the close binary system @xmath0 umi ap .",
    "this duplicity was first found from the corresponding variations in the radial velocity of @xmath0 umi a. however , the interpretation of the radial velocities of @xmath0 umi a in terms of a spectroscopic binary is obviously complicated by the fact that @xmath0 umi a itself is pulsating and that this pulsation varies with time .",
    "we use in this paper the spectroscopic orbit derived by kamper ( 1996 ) , which is based on radial velocity observations from 1896 to 1995 .",
    "kamper ( 1996 ) took into account changes in the amplitude of the pulsation and in the period of pulsation , but used otherwise a fixed sinusoid for fitting the pulsation curve .",
    "in an earlier paper , roemer ( 1965 ) considered even ` annual ' changes in the form of the pulsation curve . in table 4",
    ", we list the elements of the spectroscopic orbit of a in the pair ap given by kamper ( 1996 , his table iii , ddo + lick data ) .",
    "the orbital period of @xmath0 umi ap is 29.59@xmath110.02 years , and the semi - amplitude is @xmath12 km / s .",
    "the value of @xmath13 au corresponds to about 22 milliarcsec ( mas ) , using the hipparcos parallax .",
    "attempts to observe the secondary component @xmath0 umi p directly or in the integrated spectrum of @xmath0 umi ap have failed up to now .",
    "burnham ( 1894 ) examined polaris in 1889 with the 36-inch lick refractor and found no close companion to @xmath0 umi a ( nor to @xmath0 umi b ) .",
    "wilson ( 1937 ) claimed to have observed a close companion by means of an interferometer attached to the 18-inch refractor of the flower observatory .",
    "jeffers ( according to roemer ( 1965 ) and to the wds catalogue ) was unable to confirm such a companion with an interferometer at the 36-inch refractor of the lick observatory .",
    "hipparcos ( esa 1997 ) has not given any indication for the duplicity of polaris .",
    "speckle observations were also unsuccessful ( mcalister 1978 ) .",
    "all these failures to detect @xmath0 umi p directly are not astonishing in view of the probable magnitude difference of a and p of more than 6@xmath14 and a separation of a and p of less than 0.@xmath15\"2 ( see sect .",
    "roemer and herbig ( roemer 1965 ) and evans ( 1988 ) searched without success for light from @xmath0 umi p in the combined spectrum of @xmath0 umi ap . from iue spectra",
    ", evans ( 1988 ) concluded that a main - sequence companion must be later than a8v .",
    "this is in agreement with our results for @xmath0 umi p , given in table 5 .",
    "a white - dwarf companion is ruled out by the upper limit on its effective temperature derived from iue spectra and by considerations on its cooling age , which would be much higher than the age of the cepheid @xmath0 umi a ( landsman et al . 1996 ) .",
    "after polaris had become known as a long - period spectroscopic binary ( moore 1929 ) , various attempts have been made to obtain an astrometric orbit for the pair @xmath0 umi ap .",
    "meridian - circle observations were discussed by gerasimovic ( 1936 ) and van herk ( 1939 ) . while van herk did not find a regular variation with a period of 30 years , gerasimovic claimed to have found such a modulation .",
    "however , the astrometric orbit of the visual photo - center of @xmath0 umi ap determined by gerasimovich ( 1936 ) is most probably spurious , since he found for the semi - major axis of the orbit @xmath16 mas , which is much too high in view of our present knowledge ( @xmath17 mas ) .",
    "more recent meridian - circle observations gave no indications of any significant perturbation .",
    "this is not astonishing in view of the small orbital displacements of the photo - center of ap of always less than 0.@xmath15\"04 .",
    "long - focus photographic observations have been carried out at the allegheny observatory ( during 19221964 ) , the greenwich observatory , and the sproul observatory ( during 19261956 ) , mainly with the aim to determine the parallax of polaris .",
    "the discussion of this material by wyller ( 1957 , sproul data ) and by roemer ( 1965 , allegheny data ) did not produce any significant results .",
    "the allegheny plates were later remeasured and rediscussed by kamper ( 1996 ) , using his new spectroscopic orbital elements .",
    "kamper also rediscussed the sproul plates .",
    "while the sproul data gave no relevant results for @xmath0 umi ap , the allegheny data gave just barely significant results , such as @xmath18 mas .",
    "for our purpose ( see sect .",
    "3.2.3 ) , the most important implication derived by kamper ( 1996 ) from the allegheny data is that the astrometric orbit of ap is most probably retrograde , not prograde .    in sect .",
    "3 we shall present a more reliable astrometric orbit of @xmath0 umi ap by combining ground - based fk5 data with hipparcos results , using kamper s ( 1996 ) spectroscopic orbit as a basis .",
    "the hipparcos astrometric satellite has obtained for @xmath0 umi ap a trigonometric parallax of @xmath19 mas , which corresponds to a distance from the sun of @xmath20 pc . in the data reduction for hipparcos",
    ", it was implicitely assumed that the photo - center of the pair ap moves linearly in space and time , i.e. a ` standard solution ' was adopted .",
    "this is a fairly valid assumption , since the deviations from a linear fit over the period of observations by hipparcos , about 3 years , are less than 1 mas ( see sect .",
    "hence the hipparcos parallax obtained is most probably not significantly affected by the curvature of the orbit of ap .",
    "nevertheless , it may be reassuring to repeat the data reduction of hipparcos for @xmath0 umi , adopting the astrometric orbit derived here for implementing the curvature of the orbit of the photo - center of @xmath0 umi ap .",
    "the mean apparent visual magnitude of the combined components a and p is @xmath21 ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) .",
    "this agrees fairly well with the hipparcos result ( esa 1997 ) @xmath22 . in accordance with most authors",
    "we assume that the reddening @xmath23 and the extinction @xmath24 of the polaris system are essentially zero ( e.g. , turner 1977 , gauthier & fernie 1978 ) , within a margin of @xmath25 in @xmath23 and @xmath26 in @xmath24 . using the hipparcos parallax , we find for the mean absolute magnitude of ap @xmath27 .",
    "if we use our results of table 5 for component p , i.e. @xmath28 , and subtract the light of p from @xmath29 , then the absolute magnitude of the cepheid component a is @xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , the pecularities in the pulsation of @xmath0 umi a are certainly not very favourable for using this nearest cepheid as the main calibrator of the zero - point of the period - luminosity relation of classical cepheids .",
    "already in 1779 , w. herschel ( 1782 ) discovered the visual - binary nature of polaris .",
    "the present separation between ap and b is about 18.@xmath15\"2 .",
    "this separation corresponds to 2400 au or 0.012 pc , if b has the same parallax as ap .",
    "kamper ( 1996 ) has determined the tangential and radial velocity of b relative to ap .",
    "both velocities of b agree with those of ap within about 1 km / s .",
    "hence kamper ( 1996 ) concludes that b is most probably a physical companion of ap , and not an optical component .",
    "the physical association between ap and b is also supported by the fair agreement between the hipparcos parallax of ap ( @xmath20 pc ) and the spectroscopic parallax of b ( 114 pc , as mentioned below ) .",
    "the spectral type of b is f3v .",
    "the magnitude difference between b and the combined light of ap is @xmath31 ( kamper 1996 ) . using @xmath32",
    ", this implies for b an apparent magnitude of @xmath33 . adopting the hipparcos parallax ( and no extinction ) , we obtain for b an absolute magnitude of @xmath34 .",
    "the standard value of @xmath35 for an f3v star on the zero - age main sequence is @xmath36 .",
    "if we use this standard value for @xmath35 , we obtain for b a spectroscopic distance of @xmath37 pc .",
    "similar values of the spectroscopic distance were derived ( or implied ) by fernie ( 1966 ) , turner ( 1977 ) , and gauthier & fernie ( 1978 ) .",
    "these authors were interested in the absolute magnitude ( and hence in the distance ) of b in order to calibrate the absolute magnitude of the cepheid a. now the use of the hipparcos trigonometric parallax is , of course , better suited for this purpose .",
    "the typical mass of an f3v star is @xmath38 .",
    "if we use for the masses of a and p the values adopted in table 5 ( @xmath39 ) , we obtain for the triple system a total mass of @xmath40 ) .",
    "we derive from @xmath41``@xmath42 and the statistical relation @xmath43 an estimate for the semi - major axis of the orbit of b relative to ap of @xmath44 '' or 2700 au . from kepler s third law",
    ", we get then an estimate of the orbital period of b , namely @xmath45 years .    from the data given above",
    ", we can estimate the acceleration @xmath46 of the center - of - mass of the pair @xmath0 umi ap due to the gravitational attraction of @xmath0 umi b. if we project this estimate of @xmath46 on one arbitrarly chosen direction , we get for ap a typical ` one - dimensional ' acceleration of about 0.003 ( km / s)/century or 0.4 mas / century@xmath47",
    ". therefore , we should expect neither in the radial velocity nor in the tangential motion of ap a significant deviation from linear motion due to the gravitational force of b during the relevant periods of the observations used .",
    "for all present purposes , it is fully adequate to assume that the center - of - mass of the pair @xmath0 umi ap moves linearly in space and time .",
    "the same is true for the motion of b.    a modulation of the relative position of b with respect to the photo - center of ap with a period of about 30 years is not seen in the available observations of b. this is in accordance with our determination of the motion of the photo - center of ap with respect to the cms of ap , given in table 7 .",
    "the expected amplitude of the modulation is less than 0.@xmath15\"04 and is obviously not large enough with respect to the typical measuring errors in the relative position of b.    the contribution of the orbital motion of the center - of - mass ( cms ) of ap , due to b , to the total space velocity of ap is of the order of a few tenth of a km / s .",
    "the expected value of the velocity of b relative to the cms of ap is of the order of 1 km / s .",
