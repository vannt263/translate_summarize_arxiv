    "since the pioneering theoretical work by ritchie@xcite and the electron - loss spectroscopy measurements by powell and swan,@xcite physics of surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) has been extensively studied for more than five decades.@xcite spps are electromagnetic ( em ) waves coupled to the collective excitations of electrons on the surface of a conductor.@xcite in this coupling , the electrons oscillate collectively in resonance with the em waves and hence trap the em waves on the surface .",
    "the resonant coupling leads to the spps and gives rise to their unique properties , such as the enhancement of the surface electric fields and the slowing down of the group velocity of the em waves.@xcite applications exploiting these properties have been widely studied in biosensing,@xcite solar cells,@xcite quantum information processing,@xcite subwavelength optical imaging and waveguiding devices.@xcite    the spps often suffer from dissipative losses.@xcite overcoming the losses is crucial for the improvement of performance of many spp - based devices , such as the fidelity of the waveguide and the sensitivity of the single - molecule sensor.@xcite an effective modulation of the losses is also highly desirable for active plasmonic devices proposed in recent years.@xcite thus , a thorough understanding of the damping processes responsible for the dissipative losses is essential .",
    "since the spps in metals have been the major focus for many decades , previous studies on the damping processes have traditionally been focused on metals .",
    "it is found that the dominant damping process is the decay of the spps into electrons , i.e. , the landau damping.@xcite the interband transitions and the many - body exchange - correlations can have pronounced influences on the landau damping .",
    "these influences can be incorporated into microscopic models based on time - dependent density - functional theory or semiclassical model hamiltonian of the spp.@xcite calculations based on these models have shown good agreement with experiments.@xcite    in recent years , doped semiconductors , such as sic , gaas , inas , cu@xmath0s and cu@xmath0se , are suggested as promising candidates to replace metals in spp applications.@xcite the spps in doped semiconductors are characterized by their substantial low losses and tunable frequencies.@xcite they are also easier to be manipulated via doping or external electric / magnetic fields and to be integrated into complex , functional circuits.@xcite the further development of the spps in doped semiconductors requires a better understanding of their damping processes .",
    "however , the physics involved in doped semiconductors can be quite different from that in metals . for doped semiconductors",
    ", although the landau damping is still believed to be the leading damping process at large wavevectors,@xcite the charge depletion / accumulation layer@xcite and the electron scattering@xcite are found to have important influence on the damping . of particular importance",
    "is the effect of the electron scattering , since the typical scattering rate can be comparable to the spp frequency in semiconductors .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this effect has only been discussed by using phenomenological relaxation times.@xcite a microscopic theory exploiting this effect has not been established yet .    in this paper , by combining the semiclassical model hamiltonian of the spp@xcite and the nonequilibrium green - function approach,@xcite we present a microscopic kinetic theory to study the damping of the spp in doped semiconductors , within which the relevant electron scatterings are treated fully microscopically . the main purpose of this work is to understand the influence of these scatterings on the landau damping of the spp . to demonstrate this , we focus here on the spps in inas nanowires@xcite and concentrate on the electron - impurity ( ei ) , electron - phonon ( ep ) and electron - electron ( ee ) coulomb scatterings .",
    "we find that the scattering can have pronounced influences on the landau damping of the spp by modulating the resonance between the electrons and the spps .",
    "different scattering has different effect on the resonance .",
    "the main effect of the ei and ep scatterings is to introduce a broadening to the resonance , whereas the ee scattering can not only case a broadening , but also introduce a shifting to the resonance . for inas nanowires ,",
    "the ep - scattering  induced broadening is found to be the dominant effect .",
    "these effects can lead to a pronounced influence on the damping of the spp , which can be seen from both the size and temperature dependence of the spp damping : ( 1 ) the size - dependent oscillations of the spp damping are smeared out , and ( 2 ) the temperature dependence of the spp damping is suppressed by the scattering .",

    "this can be better seen by comparing the polarization with the ei scattering ( olive curve ) to the one without scattering ( red curve ) . according to the previous discussion ,",
    "these features indicate that the ei scattering introduces a small broadening .    in the presence of the ee scattering",
    ", a shifting of the peaks can be seen clearly by comparing the contour plot of the corresponding polarization ( green curve ) to the one without scattering ( red curve ) .",
    "note that small side peaks can also be identified with the ee scattering .",
    "these features indicate that the ee scattering introduces a large shifting to the corresponding resonant pairs .",
    "the broadening due to the ee scattering is small since the small side peaks are not smeared out .",
    "it is also noted that the ee scattering can distort the polarization .",
    "the peak becomes fragmented and the profile becomes non - lorentzian .",
    "however , as the influence to the spp damping comes from the summation of the polarizations as indicated by eq .  , the effect of these distortion on the spp damping is marginal .    in the presence of the ep scattering , the peak in the polarization ( blue curve )",
    "is markedly broadened and all the side peaks are smeared out , indicating that the effect of the ep scattering introduces a large broadening . note that the maximum of the broadened peak is also shifted compared to the one without scattering .",
    "this shows that the ep scattering can also have contribution to the shifting of the resonant pairs .",
    "however , due to the large broadening , the effect of such shifting on the spp damping is marginal .",
    "we also point out that due to the large broadening , the profile of the unnormalized polarization is mainly determined by the population difference rather than the resonance , which can be seen from the corresponding unnormalized polarization ( blue curve ) in fig .",
    "[ re : fig4](b ) .    in the presence of all the three scatterings",
    ", one finds that the polarization ( brown curve ) has almost the same profile as the one with the ep scattering only .",
    "the broadening and shifting due to the ei and ee scatterings are negligible due to the large broadening introduced by the ep scattering .",
    "this indicates that the ep scattering plays the dominant role .    for the weak landau damping regime , as the scattering has different influence on the spp damping rate in different temperature regimes .",
    "we plot the normalized polarizations in fig .  [ re : fig5 ] for three typical cases : ( a ) @xmath167  nm , @xmath296  k , ( b ) @xmath167  nm , @xmath292  k and ( c ) @xmath167  nm , @xmath297  k , corresponding to the low , intermediate , and high temperature regimes , respectively .",
    "the polarizations are plotted for the resonant pair ( ii ) which dominates the spp damping in these cases .",
    "similar broadening and shifting can also be identified in the figure .",
    "note that in these cases , the shifting due to the ee scattering is rather small and difficult to be identified in the figures .    0 r. h. ritchie , phys . rev . * 106 * , 874 ( 1957 ) . c. j. powell and j. b. swan , phys .",
