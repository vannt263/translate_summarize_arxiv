    "the evolution of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) has been a difficult quantity to pin down for all but the most powerful sources up to moderate redshifts .",
    "these sources appear to trace the most massive galaxies at all cosmic epochs ( e.g. jarvis et al .",
    ", 2001 ; willott et al . , 2003 ) and so understanding their evolution is of strategic importance to astronomy .",
    "further , radio sources make particularly useful probes of galaxy and agn evolution because radio emission is not affected by dust obscuration .",
    "the evolution in the space density of the radio source population is therefore a crucial element in our understanding of the agn phenomena .",
    "it has been suggested that the radio agn population is composed of different types of objects .",
    "the more powerful sources show a high surface brightness at the ends of a double lobed structure ( fanaroff - riley type ii ; hereafter frii ; fanaroff & riley 1974 ) whereas the less powerful sources have high surface brightness nearest their centres ( fri ) .",
    "it is now well established that the frii radio sources evolve strongly between @xmath3 ( longair 1966 ; dunlop & peacock 1990 ) with a decrease in the comoving space density of @xmath4 since @xmath5 . however , very little is known about the lower - luminosity fri radio sources .",
    "various groups have tried to understand how the lower - luminosity radio sources evolve with redshift .",
    "the conclusions drawn from these studies vary .",
    "for instance , jackson & wall ( 1999 ) find evidence for possible negative evolution .",
    "laing , riley & longair ( 1983 ) find , from 17 sources in the complete 3crr sample , evidence for no - evolution .",
    "similarly , a study by waddington et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of 72 sources also suggests little evidence of evolution in the space density between z = 0 and z = 1 in the low - luminosity regime .",
    "however , snellen & best ( 2001 ) find , from two objects in the hubble deep field and the flanking fields , evidence for positive evolution .",
    "this fundamental discrepancy arises because of the observational difficulty in establishing a large complete flux - density - limited radio sample at faint fluxes due to the vast overall increase in radio source counts .",
    "the problem of small number statistics can now be overcome with large multiwavelength surveys .",
    "the advent of the large radio surveys such as the 325 mhz westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) ; the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first ) and the 1.4 ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) along with large scale optical surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey data release 1 ( sdss dr1 ) allow us to probe the low - luminosity radio source population in a statistically complete manner .",
    "these surveys , when combined , provide the most efficient method of investigating the evolution of the faint radio source population as a function of cosmic epoch .",
    "the limiting factors are the flux - density limits of the radio surveys and the depth of the optical data .",
    "the wenss and first surveys can probe a radio source with @xmath6 w  hz@xmath1  sr@xmath1 ( roughly at the fri / frii break luminosity ) at a flux limit of @xmath7  mjy up to @xmath8 .",
    "the most limiting constraint comes from an upper limit in the optical flux from the sdss ( we adopt @xmath9 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the evolution in the comoving space density of low - luminosity radio sources with cross - matched catalogues formed from the wenss , first and nvss radio surveys and the recently released photometric survey sdss dr1 . in ",
    "2 we describe the selection of the radio sources and their matching to the sdss dr1 .  3 contains details of the calculation of the photometric redshifts . in ",
    "4 the evolution in the comoving space density of radio sources is tested via the @xmath2statistic . in  5 we present the results and  6 is a summary of our conclusions .",
    "we define radio spectral index @xmath10 as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the flux - density at frequency @xmath13 .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath14 and a @xmath15 , @xmath16 cosmology .",
    "we select a sample area that is sufficiently large to increase the number of low - luminosity , predominantly fri , radio sources from @xmath17 tens to about 1000 .",
    "we choose the continuous area of the northern sdss dr1 sample which is bounded by first at a declination of 64@xmath18 and wenss at 38@xmath18 .",
    "the shaded are in fig .",
    "[ survey_area ] shows the resulting area of our survey , covering 713 square degrees ( 0.217  sr ) .",
    "we wish to select radio galaxies where the optical light is dominated by the host galaxy , rather than quasars , and the radio emission may undergo doppler beaming effects along the line - of - sight ( e.g. jarvis & rawlings 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we start with the low - frequency wenss radio survey that will preferentially select optically thin steep spectrum lobe emission rather than optically thick flat spectrum ( possibly beamed ) emission .    the wenss radio sources are matched to nvss and first radio surveys , bounded by the sdss dr1 photometric survey .",
    "we summarise each of these surveys only briefly here - details can be found at each of their respective websites and references therein .    the wenss survey ( rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ; http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/wenss/ ) covers 3.14 sr north of + 30@xmath18 declination at 325 mhz with resolution of 54  and a flux - density completeness limit of approximately 18 mjy ( 5@xmath19 ) .",
    "we choose a conservative flux - density limit of 40  mjy which provides the limit for this survey .",
    "the nvss radio survey ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ; http://www.cv.nrao.edu/nvss/ ) is a 1.4 ghz continuum survey covering 10.3 sr of sky north of -40@xmath18 declination .",
    "the completeness limit is about 2.5 mjy and the images have a 45  resolution and a nearly uniform sensitivity .",
    "the first survey ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ; white et al .",
    "1997 ; http://sundog.stsci.edu ) is at 1.4 ghz and covers 2.75 sr at -10@xmath20 declination @xmath21 with resolution of 5  and a 1  mjy source detection threshold .",
    "we cross - match the wenss and nvss catalogue positions taking all matches with positional offsets of @xmath22 40  as candidate radio detections .",
    "( we use the low - resolution nvss survey over first to determine 1.4  ghz flux - densities as some of the flux may be resolved out by the higher - resolution first survey . )",
    "increasing the distance to @xmath22 45  increases the number of matched targets by only @xmath17 1% . at this distance",
    "the probability of choosing a nvss source within an arbitrary position is 2% whereas for the wenss catalogue this is 0.8% , so we expect the contamination to be at the level of @xmath23 and the 40 ",
    "offset is considered optimal .",
    "we calculate the radio spectral index , @xmath10 , for each source using the flux - density at frequencies 325 mhz and 1.4 ghz from the matched radio sources in the low - resolution wenss and nvss surveys respectively . in order to select against quasars and other non - lobe",
    "dominated sources we choose @xmath10 @xmath24 0.5 .",
    "the nvss coordinates of this cross - matched sample are further matched to the high resolution radio galaxy catalogue , first .",
    "again we choose a positional offset of @xmath22 40  .",
    "we do this for two reasons : ( i ) the increased resolution of first allow us to improve the positional accuracy of the matched wenss - nvss catalogue , thus reducing the number of mis - identified sources with the photometric survey and ( ii ) the first survey image cutouts allow an accurate visual check on the matching procedure to the sdss dr1 . the matched wenss - nvss - first yield a total of 7898 matched radio targets in the sample area to be then matched to the photometric survey .",
    "we cross - match the sdss dr1 catalogue with the first matched positions , with positional offsets of @xmath22 5  .",
    "we use the sdss modified petrosian magnitudes ( petrosian , 1976 ; strauss et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "in this magnitude system the aperture size depends on the shape of the galaxy s radial surface brightness profile but not its amplitude .",
    "the disadvantage of this system is that the photometric measurements become increasingly noisy for @xmath25 fainter than around 20 .",
    "the other option is to use sdss model magnitudes which are less noisy for the faint galaxies but have serious systematics for galaxies @xmath25 @xmath26 20 .",
    "the sdss dr1 quote point spread function magnitude limits ( 95% detection repeatability for point sources ) of 22.0 , 22.2 , 22.2 , 21.3 , 20.5 in @xmath27 respectively with the errors in the magnitudes @xmath22 3% . for petrosian magnitudes the reported errors are considerably larger than this . to ensure our sample is complete , and to minimise the photometric errors , we take a colour cut of @xmath28 21 .",
    "this effectively limits our analysis to z @xmath22 1 , assuming the host galaxies are typically @xmath29 ( mclure et al .",
    "2004 ) - which makes it the most limiting factor in the survey .",
    "additionally , we use the sdss morphological classification and select only non - stellar sources thus selecting against quasars .",
    "we overplot the optical matches from sdss dr1 onto the radio images from first . in most cases",
    "the radio source is unambiguous .",
    "however , careful visual inspection of the images reveals that 8% of the sources with optical identifications within 1 are not easily associated with a core of a radio galaxy .",
    "the majority of these cases are due to multiple identifications along the radio axis , which presumably arises from the well known alignment effect of the optical and radio emission ( e.g. eales et .",
    "1997 ; best , rttgering & longair , 2000 ; inskip et al .",
    "2002 ) . as the narrow - line luminosity",
    "is correlated with radio luminosity ( e.g. willott et al . 1999 ) then this effect will be most prominent in the more powerful frii subset .",
    "thus we are confident that the survey as a whole is @xmath24 90% complete , and the low - luminosity sources - which are our main concern in this paper - have a higher completeness",
    ". these selections result in 1014 radio sources with associated photometric data .",
    "we incrementally alter the search radius of the optically matched first and sdss dr1 radio sources from 5 arcsec to 2 arcsec in order to investigate the effect on the contamination of mis - identified sources and the completeness of the sample .",
    "ivezi ' c et al . ( 2002 ) discuss this problem in detail .",
    "these authors find that with a 1 arcsec search radius the sample is 72% complete and 1.5% contaminated . increasing the search radius to 3 arcsec results in @xmath24 99% completeness and 9% contamination .",
    "we expect the contamination in our survey to be significantly less than that found by ivezi ' c et al . as the matching of each radio source",
    "is visually inspected by overplotting the sdss dr1 photometric data on maps of the first radio sources , whereas the ivezi ' c et al .",
    "study was automated .",
    "redshift information is crucial in determining the evolution in the comoving space density of radio sources .",
    "gaining spectroscopic redshift information for all of the radio sources in our sample would be extremely time consuming on any telescope .",
    "however , the five - band photometry from the sdss dr1 allows us to use photometric redshifts to make reasonably accurate estimates of the whole sample .",
    "we use two publicly available codes to do this .",
    "the first is hyper_z _",
    "( bolzonella , miralles & pell , 2000 ) , which uses galaxy templates and various degrees of reddening to determine the most likely redshift .",
    "we assume _ a priori _ that the host galaxies of our radio sources are either elliptical galaxies or bulge dominated spirals ( e.g. mclure et al .",
    "2004 ) , and as such only use the corresponding template spectra .    the second code ( ann@xmath30 ; collister & lahav 2004 ) estimates photometric redshifts by employing neural networks which require a large training set of galaxies for which the redshifts are already known .",
    "collister & lahav demonstrate the effectiveness of their method using sdss dr1 and compare it to the hyper_z _ technique .",
    "they find that when a large training set is available the ann@xmath30 technique is more robust than hyper_z _",
    "method with smaller random and systematic errors .",
    "we use the large sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and five - band photometry from the sdss dr1 , which comprises @xmath31 galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ fig_annz ] we show the accuracy of the ann@xmath30 technique for targets in our sample with spectroscopic measurements .",
    "the random error on the photometric redshifts is typically @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig_annz ] reveals a slight systematic error .",
    "we discuss the effect of this systematic underestimate of the photometric redshifts in  [ sec : vvmax ] .",
    "beyond @xmath34 the errors in the ann@xmath30 analysis become larger , predominantly due to the fact that the majority of the galaxies observed in the spectroscopic training sample have @xmath35 .",
    "the relative dearth of high - redshift sources in the spectroscopic training set fainter than this limit means that annz is not the ideal photometric redshift code for this region of parameter space .",
    "therefore we use hyper_z _ estimates for sources with @xmath36 .",
    "in order to assess the evolution in the comoving space density of radio sources we use the non - parametric @xmath38 method ( schmidt 1968 ; rowan - robinson 1968 ) .",
    "this technique is useful as we do not have to make any _ a priori _ assumptions as to the form of any evolution .",
    "it also allows us to easily incorporate additional selection criteria .",
    "indeed this is critical for this study as we have an optical magnitude limit of @xmath39  mag .    under the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution",
    ", the value of @xmath2will be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "for such a sample the mean value is @xmath40@xmath2@xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of objects in the sample .",
    "a value of @xmath40@xmath2@xmath43 indicates that the sources are biased towards larger distances , or an increasing space density with redshift ; whereas @xmath40@xmath2@xmath44 indicates a deficit of high - redshift sources , or a decline in the space density evolution .",
    "the total fraction of sources for which vmax is set by the optical selection criteria is 35% .",
    "this is split into 13% of the low - luminosity sources and 83% of the high - luminosity sources .",
