    "the question of coexistence of singlet superconductivity and magnetism has been adressed for many years .",
    "it was found that the superconducting order parameter is destroyed by a magnetic field both via the orbital effect @xcite and the paramagnetic effect.@xcite in the usual case of an isotropic three - dimensional ( 3d ) superconductor under an external magnetic field , the orbital effect prevails and leads to the well - known temperature - field phase diagram of conventional type i or ii superconductors.@xcite in contrast , superconductivity is essentially suppressed by the paramagnetic effect in presence of a ferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "this is also true for quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconductors under in - plane magnetic field and for heavy fermions materials wherein the orbital effect is partially quenched . in the whole paper ,",
    "the magnetism is characterized by an internal exchange field @xmath1 ( given in energy units ) which may arise either from an externally applied magnetic field or from ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "note that ferromagnetism must be weak in order to avoid complete suppression of superconductivity .",
    "this is realized in rare - earth metals or actinides in which the indirect exchange interaction leads to curie temperatures of a few degrees .",
    "superconductors with internal homogeneous exchange field @xmath1 exhibit a very special behaviour . according to chandrasekhar@xcite and clogston,@xcite at zero temperature uniform superconductivity should be destroyed when the polarization energy of the free electron gas exceeds the energy gain due to cooper pairing in the bcs ground state .",
    "this criterion gives the exchange field @xmath2 where the superconductor should undergo a first - order transition to the normal state , @xmath3 being the zero temperature superconducting gap .",
    "larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite and fulde and ferrell @xcite ( fflo ) predicted the existence of a nonuniform superconducting state with higher critical exchange field @xmath4 and second - order transition to the normal state .",
    "this prediction was made for 3d superconductors . in quasi-2d superconductors",
    "the critical exchange field of the fflo state is even higher , namely @xmath5,@xcite while in quasi - one - dimensional systems there is no paramagnetic limit at all.@xcite the appearance of the modulated fflo state is related to the pairing of electrons with opposite spins which do not have the opposite momenta anymore due to the zeeman splitting . from now on we focus on the 2d case for which a generic temperature - exchange field phase diagram has been established.@xcite at low field and temperature , the ground state is characterized by a uniform superconducting order parameter .",
    "a tricritical point , located at @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is the meeting point of three transition lines separating the normal metal , the uniform and the nonuniform superconductors . at @xmath8 , the ( low - field ) uniform superconductor",
    "is separated from the ( high - field ) normal metal by a narrow fflo nonuniform superconducting phase .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath9 , the system undergoes merely a second - order phase transition from the uniform superconductor to the normal metal when increasing the exchange field .",
    "the nonuniform fflo state is settled in a small region of the phase diagram and is very sensitive to impurities,@xcite making it difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "nevertheless , several evidences of the fflo state have been obtained recently in organic superconductors @xcite and in heavy fermions compounds , see martin _ _ et al.__@xcite and references therein .    in the context of organic and high-@xmath10 superconductors , layered systems made of conducting atomic planes",
    "have been extensively studied.@xcite in order to investigate the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism in such anisotropic systems,@xcite  andreev _ et al . _ considered a periodic array of alternating ferromagnetic and superconducting 2d planes.@xcite solving the corresponding gorkov equations , these authors established the existence of a @xmath0 state wherein each f layer separates superconducting planes with opposite order parameter .",
    "this is relevant for the ruthenocuprate compound rusr@xmath11gdcu@xmath11o@xmath12 which comprises cuo@xmath11 superconducting planes and ruo@xmath11 magnetic planes.@xcite a related system is an isolated f / s / f trilayer which exhibits the so - called superconducting spin - valve effect .",
    "namely , its critical temperature is higher in the antiparallel ( ap ) orientation of the layers magnetizations than in the parallel ( p ) orientation both for thick layers@xcite and atomic size layers.@xcite surprisingly , in the atomic thickness limit , the superconducting gap at zero temperature is higher for p orientation of the magnetizations.@xcite hence one expects a transition from ap to p orientation by cooling the system below a finite crossing temperature .",
    "the recent progress in molecular beam epitaxy@xcite enables to fabricate such f / s / f trilayer with atomic thicknesses .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a periodic array of sf bilayers .",
    "each bilayer is made of two atomic planes coupled by single electron tunneling .",
    "both exchange fields and bcs superconducting pairing are present in each sf plane .",
    "the possibility of @xmath13 phase difference between the planes inside each bilayer is also taken into account . in the whole paper , we assume that the coupling @xmath14 between successive bilayers is considerably weaker than the intra - bilayer coupling @xmath15 .",
    "our study is performed within the framework of the bcs theory of s - wave superconductivity .",
    "solving exactly the gorkov equations in the limit @xmath16 , we first derive the critical temperature and the superconducting gap both for parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) orientation of the magnetizations .",
    "we show that the critical temperature is higher for the ap orientation than for the p orientation whereas it is the opposite for the zero temperature gap .",
    "we also investigate the interlayer josephson current in the small coupling limit : the current increases as a function of the exchange field for ap orientation whereas it is field - independent for the p orientation .",
    "furthermore , we find that for low exchange fields and high temperatures , the ground state corresponds to identical superconducting order parameters on adjacent layers . for high enough fields and/or low enough temperatures",
    ", the @xmath0 phase ground state is favoured and compete with the fflo state . for the p orientation ,",
    "the full temperature - exchange field phase diagram is constructed in the two limits of extremely low and high coupling between the planes . as expected , for perturbative coupling between two sf planes ,",
    "the phase diagram is very close to the quasi-2d superconductor s phase diagram .",
    "nevertheless an important change arises .",
    "indeed a new @xmath17phase is inserted inside the usual fflo phase close to the tricritical point . for higher",
    "tunneling coupling @xmath18 , this @xmath17 phase is pushed to low temperatures @xmath19 and high fields @xmath20 . in this unusual superconducting phase ,",
    "the zeeman splitting is compensated by the bonding / antibonding energy splitting due to single - electron tunneling between the planes.@xcite as a result , field - induced superconductivity and enhanced paramagnetic limit are realized in this simple model .",
    "these new phenomena are encountered due to the introduction of an additional discrete degree of freedom , here the layer index @xmath21 .",
    "the layer index acts as a pseudo - spin and thus enlarges the usual spin - space for singlet pairing .",
    "this idea was introduced by kulic and hofmann@xcite in the context of two - bands superconductivity for which the pseudo - spin was the band index .",
    "nevertheless , these authors did not investigate the presently studied @xmath0 state .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following .",
    "in sec.ii , we present the model , derive the corresponding gorkov equations and give their exact solutions . in sec.iii , we investigate the critical temperature , the gap and the interlayer josephson current in the small exchange field regime for which there are only uniform superconducting phases . in the last two sections",
    "the temperature - exchange field phase diagram of the bilayer is studied thoroughly . in sec.iv",

    ", it is convenient to write eq.([self ] ) as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the superconducting order parameter at @xmath78  in the absence of exchange field and interlayer coupling .",
    "in this section , we investigate phases with uniform superconductivity within each layer . we obtain the critical temperature of the second - order superconducting ( @xmath79 ) to normal metal ( @xmath80 ) phase transition and the order parameter @xmath81 as a function of the temperature , the exchange field @xmath1 and the interlayer coupling @xmath25 .",
    "we consider both parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) orientations of the magnetizations , the superconducting phase difference being either @xmath82 or @xmath13 .",

    "iv and sec .",
    "v.      we consider the second - order phase transition between the normal metal and the uniform bcs superconductor .",

    "this is surprising because ap orientation was expected to weaken the effective exchange field and thus enhance superconducting properties .",

    "this phenomenon has been called inversion of the proximity effect.@xcite moreover , the gap @xmath148 is larger than @xmath149 for all temperatures .    according to these results",
    ", one may suggest several experiments .",
    "first we consider a bilayer with magnetizations pinned in the ap mutual orientation . by lowering the temperature ,",
    "a @xmath107-@xmath0 transition is expected at some temperature @xmath150 . in the small interlayer coupling limit , this temperature @xmath151 is a function of the exchange field only ( see fig.2 inset ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath107 state is more favorable energetically for all temperatures in the case of magnetizations pinned in the p orientation . as another illustration",
    "we consider samples where the relative orientation of magnetizations is free .",
    "then the orientation is chosen by the system to minimize its energy .",
    "cooling such a bilayer will result in a switching from the ap orientation to the p orientation at the inversion temperature @xmath152 .",
    "the same prediction was made recently in a ballistic f / s / f trilayer.@xcite      here we consider that the sf / sf bilayer is connected to superconducting electrodes . in this set - up",
    ", one may impose an arbitrary superconducting phase difference @xmath47 between the sf layers , and thus a non dissipative josephson current flows through the bilayer in the direction perpendicular to the planes .",
    "this interlayer josephson current is evaluated here in the tunneling limit @xmath153 and at zero temperature .",
    "within the green functions formalism , the general formula for the interlayer josephson current is @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the two - dimensional density of state per spin direction and unit surface . solving exactly the gorkov equations ( [ equationgorkov ] ) leads to @xmath156 the function @xmath157  is obtained from eq.([g21 ] ) by permuting the layer indexes @xmath158 the corresponding anharmonic current - phase relationship",

    "the second harmonic @xmath163 has also been evaluated and is smaller than the first one by a factor @xmath164 . the preceding equation ( [ courant1 ] )",

    "_ in the parallel case _",
    "the critical current does not depend on the field as already reported in other systems since @xmath165.@xcite  _ for the antiparallel orientation _ and to the lowest order in @xmath25 , the current - phase relation reads @xmath166 where @xmath167 @xmath168 .",
    "therefore the critical current increases with the exchange field @xmath1 and even diverges for @xmath169 of course this divergence is unphysical and should disappear if all orders in @xmath25 were taken into account . in fig.3 ,",
    "the critical current is shown as a function of the exchange field both for p and ap orientations .",
    "recently , the issue of the josephson coupling between two clean sf layers through an insulating layer was considered using eilenberger equations @xcite or bogoliubov - de gennes formalism.@xcite similar results as ours were obtained : the critical current increases with @xmath1 only if three conditions are met : low temperature , very weak coupling between the sf layers and ap orientation .",

    "we retrieve the well - known case of a single sf layer .",

    "we will also describe the nature of the various superconducting states and what kinds of transitions are encountered .",
    "we focus on the vicinity of the tricritical point . then @xmath204 is a linear function of the exchange field with @xmath205 , whereas @xmath185 is nearly field and temperature independent .    for high reduced fields @xmath206",

    "we now construct the phase diagram around the tricritical point . because each value of the coupling leads to different transition lines , we introduce the following mapping of the thermodynamic variables @xmath223 in order to obtain a universal phase diagram valid in the small coupling regime .",

    "solving @xmath245 , we obtain the critical line @xmath246 which corresponds to a first order @xmath247 phase transition .",
    "however , this transition is not realized ( see fig.4 ) because the transition to the  nonuniform superconducting state occurs before .",
    "the @xmath248 transition line is obtained in a similar way . the equation @xmath249 has the solution @xmath250 . at this value of @xmath233 ,",
    "the system undergoes a first order phase transition from the uniform state to the modulated fflo state . adding higher harmonics to the order parameter @xmath251 gives a more accurate evaluation , namely @xmath252 .",

    "we have obtained a universal phase diagram fig.4 of all weakly coupled sf / sf bilayers in the vicinity of the tricritical point .",
    "an important feature of this phase diagram is the presence of a superconducting @xmath257-phase . as an example , the phase diagram has been redrawn in the @xmath175 plane on fig.5 for a particular value of the coupling @xmath25 .",
    "now we consider the ballistic sf / sf bilayer in the regime of strong interlayer coupling limit @xmath84 and low temperature .",

    "the underlying physical mechanism is the compensation of the zeeman splitting by the energy splitting between bonding and antibonding electronic states of the bilayer , see fig.6.@xcite thus the new zero temperature paramagnetic limit @xmath259  may be tuned far above the usual one @xcite @xmath262 merely by increasing the interlayer coupling .",
    "this compensation also occurs for small coupling , but the @xmath257-superconducting state is then less energetically favorable than the usual @xmath107-superconducting phase as demonstrated in sec.iv",

    "one must then find the value of @xmath267 which maximizes the critical field @xmath268 . if  the @xmath0 phase is assumed to be uniform inside each plane , namely if @xmath269 , eq.([hcritfflo1 ] )  merely reduces to  @xmath270 the lower and upper critical fields are respectively given by @xmath271 , in the limit @xmath272 .",
    "thus at zero temperature and strong enough coupling , the superconductivity destruction follows a very special scenario . at low fields ,",
    "superconductivity is first suppressed as usual at the paramagnetic limit @xmath273 leading to the normal metal phase",

    "the structure of these @xmath192 and the @xmath199 phases is reminiscent of the corresponding @xmath176 and the @xmath198 phases although the former are shifted to higher fields and lower temperatures than the later .    above results",

    "the corresponding gorkov equations have been solved exactly , taking into account both in - plane fflo modulation and arbitrary superconducting phase difference between sf layers .",
    "the superconducting state with zero phase difference is always settled in the low field regime , @xmath327 for parallel ( p ) orientation of the magnetizations . for antiparallel",
    "( ap ) orientation , the @xmath0 state predominates at low temperatures over the @xmath107 state which is settled in the neighborhood of the critical line .",
    "consequently if the system is pinned in the antiparallel orientation , we predict a transition from the usual @xmath82 superconducting state to the @xmath0 state by cooling .",

    "indeed such perovskite superconductors comprise tightly coupled superconducting cuo planes separated by bio layers .",
    "however observing the field - induced superconductivity in a reasonable range of magnetic field requires relatively low critical temperatures which are realized in the heavily doped or underdoped regimes .",
    "finally the latter effect is solely related to the compensation of the energy shift in the two layers systems by the zeeman splitting .",

    "<S> we present the detailed theoretical study of a heterostructure comprising of two coupled ferromagnetic superconducting layers . our model may be also applicable to the layered superconductors with alternating interlayer coupling in a parallel magnetic field . </S>",

    "<S> we obtain a new @xmath0 phase inserted within the fflo phase and located close to the usual tricritical point , whereas for strong interlayer coupling the bilayer in the @xmath0 state reveals a very high paramagnetic limit and the phenomenon of field - induced superconductivity . </S>"
