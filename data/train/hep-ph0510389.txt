    "conventional astronomy spans 60 octaves in photon frequency , from @xmath0  cm radio - waves to @xmath1  cm @xmath2-rays of gev energy .",
    "this is an amazing expansion of the power of our eyes which scan the sky over less than a single octave just above @xmath3  cm wavelength . in recent years ,",
    "detection and data handling techniques of particle physics have been reborn in instrumentation to probe the universe at new wavelengths , smaller than @xmath1  cm .",
    "in addition to the traditional photon signals , neutrinos and very high - energy protons ( that are only weakly deflected by the magnetic field of our galaxy ) have become astronomical messengers from the universe . as exemplified time and again , the development of novel ways of looking into the cosmos invariably results in the discovery of unanticipated phenomena . for particle physicists ,",
    "the sexiest astrophysical problem is undoubtedly how nature manages to impart an energy of more than one joule to a single elementary particle .",
    "although cosmic rays were discovered almost a century ago , we do not know how and where they are accelerated .",
    "this may be the oldest mystery in astronomy and solving it is challenging as can be seen by the following argument .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that , in order to accelerate a proton to energy @xmath4 in a magnetic field @xmath5 , the size @xmath6 of the accelerator must encompass the gyro radius of the particle : @xmath7 i.e. the accelerating magnetic field must contain the particle s orbit . by dimensional analysis , this condition yields a maximum energy @xmath8 the @xmath9-factor has been included to allow for the possibility that we may not be at rest in the frame of the cosmic accelerator , resulting in the observation of boosted particle energies .",
    "opportunity for particle acceleration to the highest energies is limited to dense regions where exceptional gravitational forces create relativistic particle flows .",
    "all speculations involve collapsed objects and we can therefore replace @xmath6 by the schwarzschild radius @xmath10 to obtain @xmath11    cosmic accelerators are also cosmic beam dumps producing secondary photons and neutrino beams .",
    "particles accelerated near black holes pass through intense radiation fields or dense clouds of gas leading to production of secondary photons and neutrinos that accompany the primary cosmic ray beam . the target material , whether a gas or photons , is likely to be sufficiently tenuous so that the primary beam and the photon beam are only partially attenuated .    at this point",
    "a reality check is in order .",
    "such a dimensional analysis applies to the fermilab accelerator : 10 kilogauss fields over several kilometers ( covered with a repetition rate of @xmath12 revolutions per second ) yield 1  tev .",
    "the argument holds because , with optimized design and perfect alignment of magnets , the accelerator reaches efficiencies matching the dimensional limit .",
    "it is highly questionable that nature can achieve this feat .",
    "theorists can imagine acceleration in shocks with an efficiency of perhaps @xmath13    given the microgauss magnetic field of our galaxy , no structures are large or massive enough to reach the energies of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "dimensional analysis therefore limits their sources to extragalactic objects .",
    "a common speculation is that they may be relatively nearby active galactic nuclei powered by a billion solar mass black holes . with kilo - gauss fields we reach @xmath14  gev .",
    "the jets ( blazars ) emitted by the central black hole could reach similar energies in accelerating sub - structures boosted in our direction by a @xmath9-factor of 10 , possible higher .",
    "the neutron star or black hole remnant of a collapsing supermassive star could support magnetic fields of @xmath15  g , possible larger .",
    "shocks emanating from the collapse black hole could be the origin of gamma ray bursts and , possibly , the source of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "the astrophysics problem is so daunting that many believe that cosmic rays are not the beam of cosmic accelerators but the decay products of remnants from the early universe , for instance topological defects associated with phase transitions ( near @xmath16  gev ) in grand unified theories ( gut s ) . a topological defect will suffer a chain decay into gut particles @xmath17 that subsequently decay to familiar weak bosons , leptons , quarks- or gluon - jets .",
    "cosmic rays are the fragmentation products of these jets .",
    "all in all , where the highest energy cosmic rays are concerned , both the accelerator mechanism and the particle physics are enigmatic .",
    "there is a realistic hope that the oldest problem in astronomy will be resolved soon by ambitious experimentation .",
    "one such experiment is the icecube neutrino telescope , which is required to be sensitive to the best estimates of potential cosmic ray neutrino fluxes .",
    "though this telescope is primarily motivated by these astronomical goals , it has also appeared in the u.s .",
    "roadmap to particle physics , and as we will argue in this review , deservedly so .    as the lightest of fermions and the most weakly interacting of particles",
    ", neutrinos occupy a fragile corner of the standard model and one can realistically hope that they will reveal the first and most dramatic signatures of new physics .",
    "icecube s opportunities for particle physics are only limited by imagination ; they include    * the search for theories where particle interactions , including gravity , unify at the tev scale .",
    "neutrinos with energies approaching this scale will interact gravitationally with large cross sections , similar to those of quarks and leptons , and this increase should yield dramatic signatures in a neutrino telescope including , possibly , the production of black holes . * the search for deviations from the neutrino s established oscillatory behavior that result from non - standard interactions , for instance neutrino decay or quantum decoherence . * the search for a breakdown of the equivalence principle as a result of non - universal interactions with the gravitational field of neutrinos with different flavors . similarly ,",
    "the search for breakdown of lorentz invariance resulting from different limiting velocities of neutrinos of different flavors . *",
    "the search for neutrinos from the annihilation of dark matter particles gravitationally trapped at the center of the sun . * the search from particle emission from cosmic strings or other topological defects and heavy cosmological remnants created in the early universe . * the search for magnetic monopoles .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that we may be guessing the future while holding too small deck of cards and icecube will open a new world that we did not anticipate .",
    "the case for doing particle physics with cosmic neutrinos is compelling , the challenge has been to deliver the technology to build the instrumentation for a neutrino detector with the largest possible effective telescope area to overcome the small neutrino cross section with matter , and the best possible angular and energy resolution to address the wide diversity of possible signals .",
    "we discuss this next .",
    "in deep ice neutrinos are detected by observation of the erenkov light emitted by charged particles produced in charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions . to a first approximation",
    ", a neutrino ( of energy @xmath18 ) incident on a side of area @xmath19 will be detected provided it interacts within the lattice of photomultiplier tubes ( pmt s ) constituting the sensitive volume @xmath20 of the detector .",
    "that probability is @xmath21 \\simeq l / l_{\\nu}(e_\\nu ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath22^{-1}$ ] is the mean free path . here",
    "@xmath23 is the density of the ice , @xmath24 is avogadro s number and @xmath25 is the neutrino nucleon cross section .",
    "a neutrino flux @xmath26 ( neutrinos per gev per @xmath27 per s ) crossing a detector with energy threshold @xmath28 and cross sectional area @xmath29 facing the incident beam will produce @xmath30 events after a time @xmath31 . in practice ,",
    "the `` effective '' detector area @xmath32 is not strictly equal to the geometric cross section of the instrumented volume facing the incoming neutrino because even neutrinos interacting outside the instrumented volume , may produce a sufficient amount of light inside the detector to be detected .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 is determined as a function of the incident neutrino direction by simulation of the full detector , including the trigger .",
    "to be realistic such a simulation must account for all of the detector properties that we discuss next .    the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda )  @xcite is located below the surface of the antarctic ice sheet at the geographic south pole . during 1993 and 1994 , in an exploratory phase project , the four - string amanda - a array was deployed and instrumented with 80 pmt s spaced at 10  m intervals from 810 to 1000  m. a deeper array of 10 strings , referred to as amanda - b10 , was deployed during the austral summers between 1995 and 1997 , to depths between 1500 and 2000  m. the instrument volume of amanda - b10 forms a cylinder with diameter 120  m , overlooked by 302 pmt s . during december 1997 and january 2000 , the detector was expanded by adding nine strings of pmt s . the composite array of 19 strings and 677 pmt s forms the amanda - ii array .    overall , amanda represents a proof of concept for the kilometer - scale neutrino observatory , icecube  @xcite , now under construction .",
    "icecube will consist of 80 kilometer - length strings , each instrumented with 60 10-inch photomultipliers spaced by 17  m. the deepest module is 2.4  km below the surface .",
    "the strings are arranged at the apexes of equilateral triangles 125 m on a side .",
    "the instrumented ( not effective ! ) detector volume is a cubic kilometer .",
    "a surface air shower detector , icetop , consisting of 160 auger - style  @xcite erenkov detectors deployed over 1km@xmath33 above icecube , augments the deep - ice component by providing a tool for calibration , background rejection and air - shower physics .",
    "the expected energy resolution is @xmath34 on a log@xmath35 scale .",
    "construction of the detector started in the austral summer of 2004/2005 and will continue for 6 years , possibly less . at the time of writing , data collection by the first string has begun .",
    "the event signatures are grouped as tracks , showers , or a combination of the two .",
    "tracks include muons resulting from both cosmic ray showers and from cc interaction of muon neutrinos .",
    "tracks can also be produced by @xmath36 leptons arising in ultra - high energy @xmath37 cc interactions .",

    "a @xmath39 produces a muon traveling in nearly the same direction as the neutrino .",
    "secondary muons range out over kilometers at @xmath40  gev , to tens of kilometers at @xmath41  gev , generating showers along their track by bremsstrahlung , pair production and photonuclear interactions .",
    "all of these are sources of blue erenkov light . as the energy of the muon degrades along its track , the energy of the secondary showers diminishes and the distance from the track over which the associated erenkov light can trigger a pmt becomes smaller .",
    "the geometry of the lightpool surrounding the muon track over which single photo - electron are produced is therefore a kilometer - long cone with gradually decreasing radius .",
    "the orientation of the erenkov cone reveals the neutrino direction , with an angular resolution @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "muons created by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere constitute the main background .",
    "full event reconstruction , with quality cuts applied for the rejection of cosmic ray muon background , is referred to as `` level 2 ''  @xcite .",
    "down - going atmospheric neutrinos at level 2 are highly suppressed because low energy muons need to be rejected with energy cuts .",
    "high energy muons lose energy catastrophically according to @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( characterizes the ionization process ) and @xmath45 ( takes into account bremsstrahlung , @xmath46 pair production and nuclear interactions )  @xcite .",

    "\\label{murange}\\ ] ]    in the first kilometer a high energy muon typically loses energy in a couple of showers of one tenth its energy .",
    "so the initial size of the cone is the radius of a shower with 10% of the muon energy , e.g.130 m for a 100tev muon . near the end of its range",
    "the muon becomes minimum ionizing emitting light that creates single photoelectron signals at a distance of just over 10 m from the track . for 0.3 photoelectrons , the standard pmt threshold setting",

    "after production with energy @xmath54 , the muon ranges out in the rock and in the ice surrounding the detector and looses energy . here , @xmath56 is the function that describes the energy spectrum of the muons arriving at the detector .",
    "hence , @xmath56 represents the probability that a muon produced with energy @xmath54 arrives at the detector with energy @xmath57 after traveling a distance @xmath58 . the function @xmath56 is computed by propagating the muons to the detector taking into account energy losses as given in eq .",
    "( [ murange ] ) .",
    "the possibility of fluctuations around the average muon energy loss ( using the average energy loss would equalize @xmath58 to the average muon range distance ) is included in @xmath56 .",

    "are used and the effect of the rock bed below the ice is accounted for in the form of an additional angular dependence of the effective area for upward going events .",
    "the details of the detector response are encoded in the effective area @xmath60 .",
    "a phenomenological parametrization has been used to simulate the response of the icecube detector after events that are not neutrinos have been rejected ( i.e. , level 2 cuts  @xcite ) @xmath61 where @xmath49 includes the energy dependence of the effective area due to trigger requirements  @xcite . here",

    "@xmath68 is an overall normalization constant , which is calibrated using the flux of atmospheric neutrinos as seen by amanda  @xcite .",
    "after level 2 cuts are applied the atmospheric neutrino flux yields 91000 events / yr at icecube .",
    "next , one has to  simulate \" the cuts in the muon tracklength @xmath69 and the number of pmt s reporting signals in an event @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "the angular dependence of the effective area for downgoing events ( @xmath71 ) is determined by the level 2 cut on the minimum number of channels @xmath72 .",
    "this requirement leads to an @xmath73-dependent angular constraint @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the average channel multiplicity produced by a muon which reaches the detector with energy @xmath57 and @xmath76 is the spread on the distribution .",
    "the parametrization @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 shows good agreement with the charged multiplicity obtained through monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "finally , to account for the presence of the rock bed below the detector , one can introduce a phenomenological angular dependence of the effective area for upward going muons @xmath80 independent of the muon energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : aeff ] shows the effective area @xmath81 , defined as the ratio of the number of upgoing muon events , with / without the inclusion of @xmath82 and the level 2 cuts on @xmath83 , and compare the results of the semi - analytical calculation with monte carlo simulations of the detector response  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : nudist ] compares the energy spectrum and the zenith angular distribution of the events ( after level 2 cuts are applied ) obtained with the semi - analytical calculation and with monte carlo simulations .",
    "showers are generated by neutrino collisions  @xmath84 cc interactions , and all nc interactions  inside of or near the detector , and by muon bremsstrahlung radiation near the detector .",
    "normally , a reduction of the muon bremsstrahlung background is effected by placing a cut of @xmath85  gev on the minimum reconstructed energy  @xcite .",
    "electron neutrinos deposit 0.5 - 0.8% of their energy into an electromagnetic shower initiated by the leading final state electron .",
    "the rest of the energy goes into the fragments of the target that produce a second subdominant shower .",
    "because the size of the shower , of order meters in ice , is small compared to the spacing of the pmt s , it represents , to a good approximation , a point source of erenkov photons radiated by the shower particles .",
    "these trigger the pmt at the single photoelectron level over a spherical volume whose radius scales linearly with the shower energy . for ice ,",
    "the radius is 130  m at @xmath86  gev and 460  m at @xmath87  gev , i.e. the shower radius grows by just over 50 m per decade in energy .",
    "the measurement of the radius of the sphere in the lattice of pmt determines the energy and turns neutrino - detection - experiments into total energy calorimeters .",
    "note that a contained  direct hit \" by a @xmath87  gev neutrino will not saturate a km@xmath88 detector volume .",
    "because the shower and its accompanying erenkov lightpool are not totally symmetric but elongated in the direction of the leading electron ( and incident neutrino ) , its direction can be reconstructed .",
    "pointing is however far inferior to what can be achieved for muon neutrinos and estimated to be precise to @xmath89 only .",
    "the expected shower event rate at icecube can also be estimated through semi - analytical calculations  @xcite , @xmath90 where    @xmath91    and @xmath92    here , @xmath93 is the differential nc interaction cross section producing a secondary neutrino of energy @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the effective volume shown in fig .",
    "[ ice3v ] . in writing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : shsourcecc ] ) and ( [ eq : shsourcenc ] ) we are assuming that for contained events the shower energy corresponds with the interacting @xmath96 or @xmath37 neutrino energy ( @xmath97 ) in a cc interaction , while for nc the shower energy corresponds to the energy in the hadronic shower @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the usual inelasticity parameter in deep inelastic scattering  @xcite .",

    "( [ taudecay ] ) and ( [ tauloss ] ) it is easily seen that for energies above about @xmath103 gev the @xmath36 is more likely to interact electromagnetically than to decay , whereas for @xmath104  gev the energy loss before decay is negligible .    for @xmath36 leptons less energetic than @xmath105  gev ,",

    "@xmath105  gev , the range of the tau becomes a few hundred meters and the two showers produced may be easily separated and be identify as a double bang event . at energies between @xmath106  gev , the tau decay length is comparable to the instrumented volume . in such cases , one may observe a @xmath36 track followed by the @xmath36-decay shower ( `` lollipop topology '' ) , or a hadronic shower followed by a @xmath36 track which leaves the detector ( `` popillol topology '' ) . at energies",
    "@xmath107  gev , @xmath108  km and @xmath36 s leave only a track like muons . however , a @xmath36 going through the detector at high energies without decaying will not deposit as much energy in the detector as a comparable - energy muon , due to the mass difference .",
    "( the direct - pair production process scales inversely with mass , so it dominates tau - lepton energy loss  @xcite resulting in 1/20@xmath109 the light produced by a muon . )",
    "such a tau might then be indistinguishable from a low energy muon track , and thus might not be flagged as an interesting event . in summary ,",
    "the energy range from @xmath110  gev is the `` sweet spot '' for @xmath36 detection in icecube , since here one can observe all the distinctive topologies .",
    "although neutrino `` telescopes '' are designed as discovery instruments , be it for particle or astrophysics , their conceptual design is very much anchored to the observational fact that nature produces protons and photons with energies in excess of @xmath14  gev and @xmath86  gev , respectively .",
    "the cosmic ray connection sets the scale of cosmic neutrino fluxes .",
    "we discuss this next .",
    "icecube is unique among high energy neutrino experiments in being sensitive to ten decades in energy . unlike terrestrial experiments with a man - made beam ,",
    "the luminosity varies significantly with the center - of - mass energy  @xcite . in what follows",
    "we discuss the different energy regimes accesible to icecube .",
    "a guaranteed beam of high energy neutrinos originates in the atmospheric cascades initiated by cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "when protons and nuclei enter the atmosphere , they collide with the air molecules and produce all kind of secondary particles , which in turn interact or decay or propagate to the ground , depending on their intrinsic propeties and energies . in the gev range ,",
    "the most abundant particles are neutrinos .",
    "the production mechanism is the decay chains of mesons created in these cascades .",
    "pion decay dominates the atmospheric neutrino production : @xmath111 and the conjugate process .",
    "this decay chain determines the neutrino energy spectra up to about 100 gev above which they become increasingly modified by the kaon contribution , which asymptotically reaches 90% . in",
    "the atmosphere mesons encounter the interaction  decay competition .",
    "therefore , neutrinos from meson decay will have a spectrum one power of energy steeper than the primary cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "the muon daughter neutrinos will have a spectrum steeper by two powers of energy , because the muon spectrum itself is steeper by @xmath112 .",
    "electron neutrinos have a differential spectrum ( approximately ) @xmath113 the muon neutrino spectrum is flatter , @xmath114 in this energy window , the flavor ratios are @xmath115  @xcite and , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ atmflux ] , the energy spectra are a function of the zenith angle of the atmospheric cascades .",
    "this is because mesons in inclined showers spend more time in tenuous atmosphere where they are more likely to decay rather than interact .",
    "for this reason the spectra of highly inclined neutrinos are flatter than those of almost vertical neutrinos . in the sub - gev energy range",
    "the spectra are significantly flatter ( parallel to the primary cosmic ray spectrum ) as all mesons and muons decay .",
    "thus , one can immediately predict that the flavor ratios at production are @xmath116 . above about @xmath12  gev , kaons are also significantly attenuated before decaying and the `` prompt '' component , arising mainly from very short - live charmed mesons ( @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) dominates the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "such a `` prompt '' neutrino flux is isotropic with flavor ratios @xmath121    the neutrino flux arising from pion and kaon decay is reasonable well understood , with an uncertainty in the range @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux , however , is much less understood , because of uncertainty about cosmic ray composition and relatively poor knowledge of small-@xmath123 qcd processes  @xcite . for numerical estimates , throughout this review we have chosen to use the 3-dimensional estimates of conventional atmospheric neutrino flux given in  @xcite , which we extrapolate to match at higher energies the 1-dimensional calculations of volkova  @xcite .",
    "we also incorporate `` prompt '' neutrinos from charm decay as calculated in  @xcite .    in 10  yr of operation icecube",
    "will collect more than @xmath124 atmospheric neutrino events with @xmath125  gev .",
    "these events are generated by neutrinos with large enough energy for standard mass - induced oscillations to be very much suppressed so they should behave as flavor eigenstates . as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ fm ] , this high - statistics high - energy event sample offers a unique opportunity to probe new physics mechanisms for leptonic flavor mixing .",
    "interactions of ultra - high energy cosmic ray protons propagating over cosmological distances with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) generates a nearly guaranteed cosmogenic flux of neutrinos  @xcite through the decay of charged pions produced in @xmath126 interactions , which should also result in a suppression of the cosmic ray spectrum above the `` gzk cutoff '' : @xmath127  gev  @xcite .",
    "the intermediate state of the reaction @xmath128 is dominated by the @xmath129 resonance , because the @xmath130 decay length is smaller than the nucleon mean free path on the relic photons .",

    "gamma rays , produced via @xmath132 decay , subsequently cascade electromagnetically on the cosmic radiation fields through @xmath133 pair production followed by inverse compton scattering .",

    ", each @xmath131 decays to 3 neutrinos and a positron .",
    "the @xmath134 readily loses its energy through synchrotron radiation in the cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "the neutrinos carry away about 3/4 of the @xmath131 energy , and therefore the energy in cosmogenic neutrinos is about 3/4 of the one produced in @xmath2-rays .",
    "the normalization of the neutrino flux depends critically on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray sources and on their proton injection spectra  @xcite .",
    "it also depends on the assumed spatial distribution of sources ; for example , relatively local objects , such as sources in the virgo cluster  @xcite , would dominate the high energy tail of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "another source of uncertainty in the cosmogenic neutrino flux is the energy at which there is a transition from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays as inferred from a change in the spectral slope  @xcite .",
    "a fourth source of uncertainty in the cosmogenic flux is the chemical composition  if ultra - high energy cosmic rays are heavy nuclei rather than protons the corresponding cosmogenic neutrino flux may be somewhat reduced  @xcite .",
    "in addition to being produced in the propagation of ultra - high energy cosmic rays , neutrinos are also expected to be generated in their sources .",
    "how many neutrinos are produced in association with the cosmic ray beam ?",
    "the answer to this question , among many others , provides the rationale for building kilometer - scale neutrino detectors .",
    "we first consider a neutrino beam produced at an accelerator laboratory .",
    "the accelerator beam is `` dumped '' into a large target , for instance a hundred meters of steel .",
    "the target absorbs all parent protons as well as the secondary electromagnetic and hadronic showers .",
    "only neutrinos , the decay products of charged pions , exit the dump .",
    "if nature constructed such a `` hidden source '' in the heavens , conventional astronomy will not reveal it .",
    "it can not be the source of the cosmic rays , however , because in this case the dump must be transparent to protons .",
    "a more generic `` transparent '' source can be imagined as follows : protons are accelerated in a region of high magnetic fields near a black hole or neutron star .",
    "they inevitably interact with the radiation surrounding collapsed objects via the processes @xmath135 and @xmath136 . while the secondary protons may remain trapped in the acceleration region , equal numbers of neutrons , neutral and charged pions escape / decay .",
    "the energies escaping the source in the form of cosmic rays , gamma rays and neutrinos produced by the decay of neutrons and neutral and charged pions , are related by the physics of photoproduction . the neutrino flux from a generic transparent cosmic ray source",
    "is often referred to as the waxman - bahcall ( wb ) flux  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to calculate and the derivation is revealing .",
    "we will concentrate on the population of extragalactic cosmic rays with energies in excess of @xmath137  gev , i.e. , beyond the `` ankle '' in the spectrum .",
    "the flux above the ankle is often summarized as `` one @xmath87gev particle per kilometer square per year per steradian '' .",
    "this can be translated into an energy flux @xmath138 from this we can derive the energy density @xmath139 in cosmic rays using flux@xmath140velocity@xmath141density , or @xmath142 we obtain @xmath143 taking the extreme energies of the accelerator(s ) to be @xmath144 .",
    "this energy density derived more carefully by integrating the spectrum beyond the  ankle \" assuming an @xmath145 energy spectrum with a gzk cutoff is closer to @xmath146  @xcite .",
    "the power required for a population of sources to generate this energy density over the hubble time of @xmath87years is @xmath147 per ( mpc)@xmath88 or , as often quoted in the literature , @xmath148 per year per ( mpc)@xmath88 .",
    "this works out to  @xcite    * @xmath149 per galaxy , * @xmath150 per cluster of galaxies , * @xmath151 per active galaxy , or * @xmath152erg per cosmological gamma ray burst .",
    "the coincidence between these numbers and the observed output in electromagnetic energy of these sources explains why they have emerged as the leading candidates for the cosmic ray accelerators .",

    "this hypothesis holds with a data set containing only one type of particle , as possible deviations of @xmath2 from 1 can be absorbed by redefining the mass of the source .",
    "the hypothesis may not be justified however , if we compare different particles or particles with different energies , since the value of @xmath2 can be particle dependent or energy dependent just like @xmath371 .",
