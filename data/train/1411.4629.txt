    "when a micron - sized object is immersed in a thermally equilibrated solution , it will undergo brownian motion due to random collisions with the surrounding fluid .",
    "the situation is vastly different when this object is suspended in a bath of active ( self - propelled ) particles , especially when its shape is not spherical .",
    "indeed , it is well known that self - propelled particles tend to accumulate around highly curved regions of suspended obstacles , thus generating density local gradients which can lead to effective propulsive forces , and anomalous rotational and translational diffusion .",
    "recent work has explored the trapping of active particles on boundaries and microstructures of different shapes and how passive obstacles can become activated in the presence of an active bath  @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have explicitly characterized how the curvature of passive tracers is related to the extent of their activation  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , having a way of selectively activating passive microstructures and their aggregates based on their shape is the first step towards the fabrication of microscopic engines , where the random active motion of one component can be converted into the persistent motion of another .",
    "a beautiful example of this process was recently shown in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we go one step further and consider the case of a passive structure with a flexible shape .",
    "specifically , we study a semi - flexible polymer ( filament ) confined in two - dimensions in the presence of a low concentration of active spherical particles .",
    "our analysis discusses the behavior of the filament for different values of the strength of the bath activity ( characterized by the particles self - propelling force ) and of the filament rigidity .",
    "recent work on active flexible filaments ( i.e.  chains formed by active brownian particles ) has shown very interesting phenomenological behavior , including periodic beating and rotational motion  @xcite . while preparing this manuscript , kaiser et al .",
    "@xcite have considered a system similar to ours , but in the fully flexible limit . in their study",
    "they show how a filament undergoes anomalous swelling upon increasing activity of the bath . here",
    ", we confirm the results reported in  @xcite , and show how adding rigidity to the filament leads to an even more complex non - monotonic behavior , where the chain softens for moderate activities , can collapse into a metastable hairpin for intermediate activities , and behaves as a fully flexible chain in the large activity limit .",
    "our data also indicate that at intermediate activities a rigid filament behaves as a two state system that dynamically breathes between a tight hairpin and an ensemble of extended conformations .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of a self - avoiding polymer confined in a two - dimensional plane and immersed in a bath of spherical self - propelled particles of diameter @xmath0 , whose motion is described via the coupled langevin equations @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the friction coefficient , @xmath3 the pairwise interaction potential between the particles , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the translational and rotational diffusion constants respectively , satisfying the relation @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is a unit vector pointing along the propelling axis of the particles , and its orientation , tracked by the angular variable @xmath8 , and is controlled by the simple rotational diffusion in eq 2 .",
    "@xmath9 is the magnitude of the self - propelling force acting on each particle .",
    "the solvent - induced gaussian white noise terms for both the translational and rotational motion are characterized by the usual relations @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the polymer consists of @xmath14 monomers of diameter @xmath0 , linearly connected via harmonic bonds according to the potential @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the center - to - center distance between linked monomers , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the equilibrium distance .",
    "an additional harmonic potential , @xmath19 , is used to introduce angular rigidity to the polymer , where @xmath20 is the angle between adjacent bonds , and @xmath21 is the equilibrium angle .",
    "values of @xmath22 considered in this work range from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the equation of motion of the filament monomers are given by eq 1 .",
    ", with @xmath25 .    the excluded volume between any two particles in the system ( including the monomers in the chain )",
    "is enforced with a purely repulsive weeks - chandler - andersen potential @xmath26     \\label{eq : lj_v}\\ ] ] with range extending up to @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the center - to - center distance between any two particles , and @xmath28 .",
    "the simulation box is a square with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "all simulations have been performed using lammps@xcite at an active particle volume fraction @xmath29 ( corresponding to 318 active particles ) , which is sufficiently small to prevent spontaneous phase separation of the active particles  @xcite . throughout this work we use the default dimensionless lennard jones units as defined in lammps , for which the fundamental quantities mass @xmath30 , length @xmath31 , epsilon @xmath32 , and the boltzmann constant @xmath33 are set to 1 , and",
    "all of the specified masses , distances , and energies are multiples of these fundamental values . in our simulations",
    "we have @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "finally @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dimensionless unit time defined as @xmath39 .",
    "we begin our analysis by measuring the radius of gyration of the filament , @xmath40 as a function of the strength of the propelling force of the surrounding particles in the bath , @xmath41 , for different values of the chain angular rigidity @xmath22 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kick_v_stiff ] .",
    "consistent with the work by kaiser et al .",
    "@xcite , a fully flexible self - avoiding filament swells when immersed in an active bath .",
    "this is due to the forces exerted on the filament by the active particles as they cluster along different regions of the filament and stretch it by pushing it in different directions .",
    "interestingly , when the filament is somewhat rigid , the opposite behavior is observed .",
    "the radius of gyration decreases for small values of @xmath41 , it reaches a minimum for intermediate activities , and it slowly begins to increase for large propelling forces .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior of the radius of gyration with @xmath41 is reminiscent of that of polyelectrolytes in the presence of multivalent salt  @xcite as a function of salt concentration .    when an active particle strikes a fully flexible filament , the filament can be stretched from a relatively compact configuration to a more extended one .",
    "however , when the filament is stiff , it is mostly stretched to begin with , and any local asymmetries in the number of active particles that cluster on either side of the filament can provide sufficiently large forces to bend it . as the filament begins to bend ( say in the middle ) , different regions of its surface will have different exposure to the active particles . specifically ,",
    "the outer region ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) will experience a larger number of collisions than the inner region as the former offers a larger cross section to the active particles .",
    "simultaneously , active particles in the inner region tend to accumulate around the areas with highest curvature [ 14 ] .",
    "the combination of the forces acting on the inner and outer regions of the filament creates a pivot around which the filament can fold into a tight hairpin .",
    "because there are no direct attractive interactions between different parts of the filament or between the filament and the active particles , the hairpin eventually unfolds .",
    "this process is initiated by the active particles located in the inner region whose forces cause the location of the hairpin s head to slide along the filament , effectively shortening one arm and lengthening the other until full unfolding is achieved .",
    "fluctuations in the number of active particles applying a force on the outer arms of the filament allow it to open slightly , thus letting active particles either out of the inner region or into it which stabilizes or de - stabilizes the filament , respectively . for a range of intermediate bath activities",
    ", the filament will therefore breath dynamically between a tightly folded and an ensemble of bent but extended configurations .",
    "[ hairpin ] shows several snapshots from our simulations highlighting the the folding and unfolding of the filament .",
    "given this complex dynamics , the average value of the filament radius of gyration provides only a limited characterization of the system .",
    "crucial information about the conformation of the filament can be extracted from the probability distribution , @xmath42 , of the radius of gyration , for different values of @xmath22 and @xmath41 . for a fully flexible chain , fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_hist](a ) , we observe that upon increasing the bath activity , the distribution , @xmath42 , begins to broaden towards larger values of @xmath43 , indicating that the filament is able to reach configurations that are more extended ( swollen ) with respect to the typical behavior expected in the absence of active particles , which is consistent with recent results by kaiser et al .",
    "for rigid filaments , fig .",
    "[ fig : rg_hist](b)-(c ) , we observe the opposite behavior as a function of the bath activity .",
    "namely , the sharply peaked distribution for large values of @xmath43 that one would expect in the absence of particle activity and that corresponds to a fully stretched filament , broadens and shifts towards lower values of @xmath43 as @xmath41 is increased in the systems .",
    "this is indicative of the softening of the chain . upon further increase of @xmath41 ,",
    "distinct peaks begin to develop ( signature of the formation of folded conformations ) . finally ,",
    "for even larger values of @xmath41 , we observe a broad distribution covering a wide range of @xmath43 .",
    "strikingly , the distributions in the large activity limit are independent of @xmath22 , implying that that a rigid filament in a bath at large activity behaves as a fully flexible filament in the same bath .    further evidence for the formation of hairpins and their relative stability with respect to more extended configurations can be obtained by combining calculations of @xmath43 with the corresponding information about the asphericity of the filament . following rudnick et al .",
    "@xcite we define asphericity as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 eigenvalue of the shape tensor . in two dimensions , this parameter is equal to @xmath23 for a circular or isotropic object , and @xmath47 for an object which extends along one dimension . in our system ,",
    "small values represent configurations where the filament is relatively symmetric about its center of mass , whereas large values indicate a fully stretched , rigid filament .",
    "we show the result of this analysis for @xmath48 in fig . [",
    "fig : rg_asphere ] , where we plot the time averaged probability distribution of configurations with a given @xmath43 and asphericity , @xmath49 . when @xmath50 the plot shows , as expected , a distribution centered around large values of @xmath43 and @xmath49 close to 1 , corresponding to a stiff filament .",
    "as the bath activity increases , at @xmath51 two distinct high probability regions emerge .",
    "both have large asphericities , indicating elongated configurations , but with well separated values of @xmath43 .",
    "the folded configuration has a value of @xmath52 and the unfolded corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "this scenario , consistent with our previous analysis , suggests a two - state system ( folded - unfolded ) where the two states have comparable probabilities .",
    "as @xmath41 is further increased , the distribution smears out as local folding and unfolding of filament segments begin to occurs at every length - scale along the chain and the filament s statistics begin to resemble that of a fully flexible swollen polymer . for comparison",
    "we also show in the same figure ( bottom - right ) the probability distribution for a fully flexible filament immersed in a bath with the same active force .",
    "in this paper we studied the behavior of a rigid filament immersed in a low volume fraction suspension of active particles confined in two dimensions as a function of filament rigidity and bath activity . using shape - sensitive observables",
    ", we fully characterize the conformational properties of the filament .",
    "our findings indicate that fully flexible filaments swell monotonically with bath activity , but rigid filaments present a more peculiar non - monotonic behavior . for small activities ,",
    "rigid filaments soften and become more flexible .",
    "as the bath activity is further increased , we observe the formation of a two state system characterized by extended and hairpin configurations , with complex local dynamics leading to their formation and de - stabilization .",
    "finally , in the large bath activity limit the behavior of fully flexible and rigid filaments become nearly identical with a large distribution of accessible filament conformations .",
    "it should be stressed that this behavior is peculiar to two - dimensional or quasi - two dimensional confinement .",
    "in fact , simulations of the same system in three dimensions ( not presented ) do not show traces of the remarkable phenomenology observed in two dimensions .",
    "this is because of the reduced probability of a collision between active particles and filaments , but more importantly because of the inability of a one - dimensional filament to effectively trap active particles in three dimensions .",
    "we however expect a behavior similar to that observed for polymers in two - dimensional membranes embedded in a three dimensional bath of active particles .",
