    "the infrared - radio correlation of star - forming galaxies @xcite suffers very few exceptions . at centimeter wavelengths , the radio continuum of massive galaxies",
    "is dominated by synchrotron emission , from cosmic ray electrons previously accelerated in type - ii supernova remnants , propagating in the interstellar magnetic field , and decaying in less than @xmath5years @xcite .",
    "the emission from thermal electrons in hii regions usually contributes only of the order of 20% of the total emission of galaxies at 3 cm , and of the order of 5% at 20 cm .",
    "the far - infrared continuum measures the energy peak of the dust emission , and is a fair tracer of the instantaneous star formation rate for dusty starburst galaxies . in more quiescent galaxies , a significant fraction of the far - infrared emission can originate from dust heated by intermediate - mass stars @xcite .",
    "ngc1377 is the most extreme example known so far of the rare category of non - dwarf galaxies which have infrared - to - radio ratios in significant excess of the average , and where the infrared excess is not attributable to cirrus - like emission  ; this is because the high dust temperatures of the selected galaxies imply high radiation field intensities @xcite . in ngc1377 ,",
    "synchrotron emission is deficient by at least a factor 37 ( i.e. by @xmath6 ) with respect to normal galaxies .",
    "in addition , hii regions were not detected through near - infrared hydrogen recombination lines nor through the thermal radio continuum , and the upper limits that we obtained imply that they are fainter than expected for normal starbursts by at least 70% , likely due to the fact that most ionizing photons are absorbed by dust .",
    "the infrared and radio emission both have their source in the star formation activity . given the lack of direct connection between the physical processes regulating both types of emission ,",
    "however , the infrared - radio correlation can hold only if strong coupling mechanisms operate @xcite .",
    "first , the production rate of cosmic rays has to be roughly proportional to that of dust - heating photons ( which is achieved for a constant initial mass function ) .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field intensity has to be coupled with either the gas density or the star formation rate ( e.g. turbulence driven by massive star formation inducing rapid amplification of the magnetic field ) .",
    "empirically , starbursts seem to constantly adjust their magnetic field so that the ratio of magnetic energy density to radiation energy density remains constant , including ultraluminous galaxies with very intense radiation fields @xcite .    the infrared emission and the radio continuum both persist for long periods subsequent to an instantaneous episode of star formation , but follow very different timescales . in particular ,",
    "cosmic rays are accelerated only about 4myr after the birth of massive stars evolving into type - ii supernovae , whereas dust is heated almost instantaneously .",
    "this time delay implies that the relative amounts of infrared and radio emission are expected to vary significantly , which can in principle be exploited to constrain the age of individual star forming regions , i.e. regions with relatively simple star formation histories .",
    "galaxies , however , host young stellar populations which span an extended age range , and star formation generally goes on for long periods , either continuously or in the form of recurrent bursts . for large regions within galaxies , systematic variations of the infrared - to - radio ratio",
    "are thus in practice erased by complex star formation histories .",
    "non - uniform interstellar medium properties ( structure and dust content ) will also induce further variations decoupled from age .",
    "discrete sources with radio spectra dominated by optically - thick thermal emission , from ultracompact hii regions , have been found and studied at high angular resolution within starbursting galaxies , most of them dwarfs : e.g. by @xcite in ngc5253 , @xcite in he2 - 10 , @xcite in ngc2146 , @xcite in several wolf - rayet galaxies , @xcite in iizw40 .",
    "these systems thus contain a number of very young star forming sites . on global scales ,",
    "the radio continuum of blue compact dwarf galaxies can be dominated by the thermal component . in such objects , both the radio and",
    "the infrared emission deviate significantly from the scaling relations with star formation rate followed by more massive galaxies ( * ? ? ? * and references therein )  : the radio continuum is depleted because of the delayed injection of cosmic rays in a young starburst , and possibly because of enhanced cosmic ray escape  ; and the infrared emission is depleted because of lower dust content , different dust properties , and higher porosity of the interstellar medium .",
    "we selected the galaxies that we term nascent starbursts from an infrared flux - limited sample by their high infrared to radio flux ratios and their high dust temperatures @xcite .",
    "these criteria are designed to select galaxies hosting very young starbursts , like the galaxies mentioned above , but constituting a very different population : their infrared luminosities are much higher , they are more massive , and if cosmic ray escape is less efficient than in dwarfs , the radio deficiency also implies that cosmic rays produced by past star formation episodes have decayed , and thus have been injected more than @xmath7myr ago . in other words ,",
    "the intensity contrast between the current starburst and the past star formation integrated over several tens of million years is very high .",
    "while classical starburst galaxies also contain very young star forming sites , our view of these is confused by recurrent burst episodes or continuous star formation in the recent past , which produce average signatures typical of evolved bursts , mimicking single populations of ages @xmath810myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nascent starbursts , on the other hand , offer an ideally simplified view because of the dominance of a single and quasi - instantaneous burst of star formation ( previous stellar generations being too old to contribute to the production of star formation tracers ) .",
    "the nascent starbursts are extremely rare .",
    "they represent a negligible fraction ( @xmath9% ) of an infrared flux - limited sample in the local universe such as the iras faint galaxy sample , and about 16% of galactic systems whose flux density is higher at 60@xmath1 m than at 100@xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "these objects nevertheless deserve careful study , because they constitute ideal settings to better understand the initial conditions and early evolution of starbursts , as well as the regulation of the infrared - radio correlation .    in such objects , where the active regions are very young and compact , the most useful diagnostics on the nature of the heating source",
    "are expected to arise from the dust and the molecular gas phases , because ultraviolet radiation will be confined to dense ultracompact hii regions @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared spectral range is of particular interest not only to constrain the nature and excitation of the small - size dust grains and aromatic compounds , but also because it contains a series of forbidden and molecular hydrogen lines providing unique diagnostics on hii regions , photodissociation regions , and the outer layers of molecular clouds , and which are much less affected by extinction than the other diagnostics accessible in the optical and near - infrared domains .",
    "an isophot mid - infrared spectrum of ngc1377 between 2.5 and 4.8@xmath1 m and between 6 and 11.5@xmath1 m was presented by @xcite , as part of a small sample of galaxies whose infrared flux density distribution peaks at 60@xmath1 m .",
    "this spectrum appeared very peculiar in comparison with normal galaxies , containing a broad emission feature between 6 and 8.5@xmath1 m in place of aromatic bands universally found in metal - rich star - forming galaxies , but lacked sufficient wavelength coverage to draw conclusions regarding the nature of the source and the excitation mechanisms of the dust and gas .",
    "ngc1377 was selected to be part of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings ) sample @xcite to extend the range of explored @xmath10 ratios , indicative of average dust temperatures . in this paper , we present the sings broadband imaging data ( 3 to 160@xmath1 m ) and spectral imaging data ( with continuous coverage between 5 and 38@xmath1 m ) of ngc1377 , as well as ancillary optical imaging and spectroscopic data obtained for sings . we analyze them in view of constraining the geometry of the gas and dust reservoir , the excitation of the different phases of the interstellar medium probed in the 538@xmath1 m range , and what these properties imply for the nature of the activity in ngc1377 .",
    "the hypothesis of non - stellar activity is discussed in section  [ seyfert ] .",
    "low spectral resolution cubes ( @xmath11130 ) between 5 and 38@xmath1 m and high spectral resolution cubes ( @xmath12 ) between 10 and 37@xmath1 m centered on the nucleus of ngc1377 were acquired with the irs instrument @xcite in february 2005 and august 2004 , respectively .",
    "for each spectral resolution mode , the full wavelength range is covered in two parts by two different slits : at low resolution , sl ( 514.5@xmath1 m ) and ll ( 1438@xmath1 m ) ; and , at high resolution , sh ( 1019.5@xmath1 m ) and lh ( 1937@xmath1 m ) .",
    "quadruple coverage is obtained at each point of the maps , except at the edges , by moving the slit in increments of half the slit size in each direction ( see @xcite and @xcite for details on the observing strategy in sings ) .",
    "given that the infrared emission of ngc1377 is not spatially resolved ( section  [ morph ] ) , all the emission is recovered within the spectral maps , the smallest of which , in the sh module , is @xmath13 .",
    "the data were pre - processed with the s12 version of the spitzer science center pipeline , and then assembled in spectral cubes with cubism .",
    "cubism is the software developed to rectify , project and co - add sings data , with the capability to subtract a spectral cube of the background and foreground ( zodiacal ) emission extracted from the data themselves , to mask pixels exhibiting an abnormal responsivity , and to perform spatial and spectral extractions ( smith et al . , 2006 , in preparation ) . in order to improve the signal to noise ratio of the high - resolution spectral data ,",
    "an extra step was included in the processing of these data , outside of cubism . in the sh and lh modules ,",
    "the slit is very narrow , only 6 pixels - wide on average , and the pixels with an abnormal responsivity are more numerous than in the sl and ll modules .",
    "because of the minimal redundancy , masking pixels can create spurious features in the final cube . to mitigate this effect ,",
    "the stacked diffraction images were inspected for obvious deviant pixels ( i.e. features that are narrower than the spectral and spatial resolution ) , and these pixels were interpolated in each pointing along the wavelength dimension .",
    "this treatment is appropriate for infrared point sources like ngc1377 , with abrupt spatial variations and a smoothly - varying continuum , and leaves intact real spectral features .",
    "images in the four bands of the irac camera @xcite , centered at effective wavelengths of 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.7 and 7.9@xmath1 m ( usually designated by their fiducial wavelengths 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath1 m ) , were obtained in august 2004 .",
    "scan maps in the three bands of the mips instrument @xcite at effective wavelengths of 24 , 71 and 156@xmath1 m ( fiducial wavelengths of 24 , 70 and 160@xmath1 m ) were acquired in september 2004 .",
    "the observing strategy and data reduction are described by @xcite .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the point spread function ( psf ) is close to 2.0  at 7.9@xmath1 m , or 200pc at the distance of ngc1377 ( 21mpc ) .",
    "flux calibration uncertainties are of the order of 10% in the irac bands , and 5% , 10% and 15% in the mips 24 , 71 and 156@xmath1 m bands .",
    "broadband infrared flux densities of ngc1377 are listed in table  [ tab_flux ] . in the irac short - wavelength bands , both the total fluxes and the nuclear fluxes",
    "are provided . in all irac bands ,",
    "the nuclear fluxes were measured within the smallest point - source aperture of diameter 4.88 , with a background annulus of internal and external diameters of 4.88  and 14.64 , in which case aperture correction factors ranging from 1.213 to 1.584 are necessary ( irac handbook ) .",
    "use of the other point - source apertures tabulated in the irac handbook , for the 5.7@xmath1 m and 7.9@xmath1 m bands , leads to fluxes higher by up to 8% and 15% respectively .",
    "the smallest aperture is preferable in our case to minimize contamination by ghosts and other artifacts ( see section  [ morph ] ) .",
    "it is also preferable , for the 3.6@xmath1 m and 4.5@xmath1 m bands , because the underlying disk emission is non - negligible at these wavelengths ( see table  [ tab_flux ] ) .",
    "no extended emission is detected in the 5.7 and 7.9@xmath1 m bands , and total fluxes measured in a large aperture ( with correction factors of 0.63 and 0.69 , respectively , that are appropriate for extended emission ) are lower than the nuclear fluxes by 25% and 6% respectively . since the aperture correction factors for extended emission are much more uncertain than for point sources , we adopt the nuclear fluxes as total measurements in the 5.7 and 7.9@xmath1 m bands .",
    "for the total fluxes in the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 m bands , we applied correction factors of 0.94 ( irac handbook ) .",
    "as the mips detectors do not suffer from the light scattering phenomenon making accurate photometry difficult in irac images , fluxes in the mips bands were simply measured by summation over the whole extent of the source .",
    "images in the b , v , r and i bandpasses were acquired at the ctio 1.5 m telescope with the cfccd ( cassegrain focus ccd ) instrument , in october 2001 .",
    "the pixel size is 0.43  and the angular resolution ( full width at half maximum ) , measured on stars nearby ngc1377 , varies between 1.15  and 1.23  in the different bandpasses . for comparison between the b band and the i band ,",
    "the images were registered using the positions of a dozen stars , with a residual radial dispersion of 0.2 , and convolved to a common resolution of 1.5 .",
    "optical long - slit spectra between 3600 and 6900 , at a spectral resolution of 8 , were acquired at the steward observatory 2.3 m telescope in november 2001 .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described by moustakas et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "we used an extraction aperture of @xmath14 centered on the nucleus of the galaxy and oriented along the minor axis .",
    "the default flux calibration of spitzer spectral data is appropriate only for staring observations of point sources , in which the loss of flux due to the diffraction beam being larger than the slit width is indirectly corrected for , by matching staring observations of stars with spectrophotometric models .",
    "additional steps are necessary to calibrate mapping observations of arbitrarily - shaped sources . although ngc1377 is a point source in the infrared ( sect .",
    "[ morph ] ) , we can not use the default flux calibration because it was not perfectly centered in the slits .",
    "the flux loss fraction as a function of wavelength was derived from estimates of the beam profile using the psf simulator distributed by the spitzer science center .",
    "the spectra of the galaxy were then corrected by this function to remove the added point - source flux falling outside the central slit , because this flux is already retrieved by mapping the source .",
    "for the low - resolution data , it is also necessary to correct for the fact that the default flux calibration is done by extracting stellar spectra within an aperture much smaller than the slit length .",
    "the conversion from e@xmath15/s units to flux density units using the full slit length was derived from highly redundant observations of the calibrating stars hr6688 ( for the ll module ) and hr7891 ( for the sl module ) , mapped in the slit - parallel direction .",
    "the spectra of these stars , extracted in an aperture of the same width as that used for ngc1377 , were divided by model spectra from @xcite to derive the flux calibration functions .",
    "these functions were adjusted with smoothly - varying polynomials before being used to divide the ll and sl spectra of ngc1377 .",
    "broadband photometry in the irac , mips and isocam filters was then simulated from the spectra , using the appropriate transmission curves , and compared with imaging photometry .",
    "we obtain excellent agreement at 24@xmath1 m and 5.7@xmath1 m : @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the agreement with isocam data",
    "is also quite good despite uncertainties in the saturation correction in the images ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "note that the spectral shape between 13 and 14.5@xmath1 m is not well calibrated at low resolution , because of an artifact at the 10% level in the detector , which can not be modelled at present .",
    "comparison with sh data , which are not affected by this artifact , however shows good consistency .",
    "we also obtain @xmath20 . since irac photometry is itself uncertain ( see sect .",
    "[ ir_images ] ) , this does not imply any significant error in the spectral flux calibration .",
    "ngc1377 is a member of the unrelaxed eridanus galaxy group @xcite , at an estimated distance of 21mpc . in stellar light",
    ", it has the appearance of a regular lenticular galaxy , with a diameter of 1.8(about 11kpc ) at the 25  mag / arcsec@xmath21 blue isophote , an axis ratio close to 2.0 , and a position angle of 92  @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on optical imaging of ngc1377 as part of a sample of galaxies with @xmath22 , mentioned the presence of a dust lane along the southern part of the minor axis , in an otherwise featureless morphology .",
    "the far - infrared ( 40120@xmath1 m ) luminosity of ngc1377 , as derived from the iras 60 and 100@xmath1 m fluxes , is @xmath23l@xmath24 .",
    "the center of the galaxy contains a compact molecular gas reservoir of @xmath25m@xmath24 or more , about ten times more massive than the amount of gas expected to be associated with the dust seen in emission ( see section  [ model ] ) , if a galactic gas to dust mass ratio is assumed @xcite .",
    "the molecular gas properties are similar to those characterizing starbursts : the far - infrared to co flux ratio is seven times higher than in normal galaxies and the gas is subthermal .",
    "figure  [ fig : color_bi_cont_i ] shows the ( b - i ) color map derived from the optical images obtained for sings .",
    "the disturbance noted by @xcite is readily apparent , but seems more complex than a single dust lane .",
    "two main orthogonal red features are surrounded by more diffuse red filaments .",
    "the color excess between the central feature and the normal light distribution immediately to the north is approximately 0.9mag .",
    "the residuals from the b - band image after subtraction of a smooth symmetric photometric model are shown in figure  [ fig : resi_b ] .",
    "some faint arcs of excess light are seen in the center , as well as to the north - east and to the south - east of the central regions .",
    "negative residuals of large amplitude , that may be interpreted as regions of excess obscuration and thus excess column density of cold dust and gas , are seen in the nucleus and several pockets immediately to the south . in addition , a straight lane extends further to the south , and diffuse structures further to the west .",
    "these faint residuals are discernible out to about 2kpc in projected distance from the nucleus .",
    "the overall morphology suggests a recent merging event with one or several small bodies , in which the structure of ngc1377 would have been preserved . as ngc1377 is very deficient in atomic hydrogen gas , more robust evidence can not be obtained from hi observations but would require high spectral resolution and high sensitivity observations of the stellar and molecular gas kinematics .    the infrared images from 3.6 to 24@xmath1 m are shown in figure  [ fig : imas_ir ] .",
    "they are dominated by a very bright nucleus . at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath1 m ,",
    "the underlying smooth emission from the old stellar disk is also visible , with the same distribution as the i - band light . the reticle - shaped artifact in the 4.5@xmath1 m image ( with orthogonal positive and negative rows )",
    "is produced by the `` multiplexer bleed '' and `` pull - down '' effects , respectively , typically associated with bright point sources ( irac handbook ) . at 5.7@xmath1 m",
    ", the stellar disk emission has fallen below the sensitivity limit , and only the nucleus is detected at longer wavelengths .",
    "it has the appearance of the point response functions of the irac and mips detectors , with bright diffraction spikes .",
    "the rows that are bright throughout the field of view of the 5.7 and 7.9@xmath1 m images exemplify the `` pull - up '' and `` optical banding '' artifacts ( irac handbook ) .",
    "since existing corrections of these artifacts are only cosmetic , we did not apply them but masked out the affected rows and columns in our analysis .    to decompose the nuclear 7.9@xmath1 m source and determine whether its size is measurable , point spread functions ( psf ) derived from observations of bright stars are not appropriate , because their cores are more extended than the observed core of ngc1377 , sampled at the native irac pixel size of 1.22 .",
    "this is probably because the spectral slope of ngc1377 within the 7.9@xmath1 m filter bandpass is much steeper than that of stars ( the flux density decreasing sharply from 7.8@xmath1 m to 9.5@xmath1 m , because of the deep flanking silicate absorption ) , and the psf width depends on the spectral slope , increasing as the spectrum reddens . the model psfs computed with the tool provided by the spitzer science center , `` s - tiny tim '' , using the spectrum of ngc1377 , are also inappropriate for our purpose , because they depend on pre - launch characteristics and are not accurate enough . within the uncertainties on the psf ,",
    "the mid - infrared source in ngc1377 is thus not resolved . both this constraint and that obtained previously on the size of the 2.12@xmath1 m molecular hydrogen line emission @xcite",
    "imply that the region of activity is less extended than @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath7pc . to look for asymmetries in the 7.9@xmath1 m emission , we extracted one half of the map on the left side of the vertical symmetry axis of the diffraction and `` pull - up '' pattern ( the tilted upper half in figure  [ fig : imas_ir ] ) , and subtracted the mirror image from the other half of the map .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : resi_8 ] .",
    "the residuals do not include any extended emission , but primary and secondary ghosts of the nucleus , as well as the real source labelled a. given its detection in the optical bands and its approximate fluxes in the irac bands , this source contains both stellar and dust components , and is likely a distant galaxy .",
    "optical slit spectroscopy shows the [ nii ] line at 6583  and the [ sii ] lines at 6716 and 6731  in emission without any detection of h@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "our long - slit data confirm this result ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specopt ] ) .",
    "the [ oiii ] , [ oii ] and h@xmath28 emission lines are not detected either . as the optical depth of the infrared source is extremely high ( sect .",
    "[ model ] ) , we infer that [ nii ] and [ sii ] arise in the foreground . even accounting for underlying stellar absorption in the h@xmath27 line",
    ", the [ nii](6583)/h@xmath27 ratio is constrained to be larger than unity . since the lines can not be excited by an active nucleus , because they do not probe the nuclear regions , they indicate shock excitation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the low [ sii](6731)/[sii](6717 ) ratio implies that they arise in regions of low electronic density @xcite .",
    "nebular diagnostics of metallicity are not useable in ngc1377 .",
    "stellar absorption indices of metallic lines and h@xmath28 , on the other hand , are measureable in the spectrum of ngc1377 . but they are degenerate with respect to age and metallicity , except for galaxies which have been passive for several gigayears , which appears not to be the case for ngc1377 : ew(mg@xmath29 ) = 2.4 , ew(fe@xmath30 ) = 2.1  and ew(h@xmath28 ) = 3.3in the index definition of @xcite . however , the large quantity of co gas and dust ( sect .  [ model ] ) , relative to the stellar emission , argues against ngc1377 being a low - metallicity system .",
    "the optical spectrum , covering a large wavelength interval ( between 3600 and 6900 ) , enables us to constrain the star formation history of ngc1377 .",
    "we used the population synthesis models of @xcite to fit the entire spectrum by a discrete sum of instantaneously - formed populations , as described by @xcite , assuming solar metallicity and a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "the estimated stellar extinction is @xmath31  mag in the screen hypothesis .",
    "we find that the light is dominated by populations older than 1gyr ( @xmath32 to 80% in the v band ) , and that the most recent star formation episode traceable in the optical occurred more than 500myr ago .",
    "this is fully consistent with the radio continuum upper limit indicating that the cosmic ray population generated by the last major star formation episode has decayed , implying that this episode occurred more than 100myr ago .",
    "the entire infrared spectral energy distribution , including the low - resolution spectra , calibrated to reproduce the broadband photometry as explained in section  [ calib ] , is shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] . to the far - infrared broadband fluxes , color corrections between 1.00 and 1.08 were applied .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the infrared source is not only very hot and thus compact ( in agreement with the fact that it is not spatially resolved ) , but is also strongly self - absorbed , as shown by the deep absorption bands from amorphous silicates at 10 and 18@xmath1 m .",
    "the forbidden lines from hii regions and photodissociation regions that are bright in star - forming galaxies ( [ siii ] , [ siii ] , [ neii ] , [ neiii ] ) are absent in ngc1377 ( table  [ tab_lines ] ) , except for a very weak [ neii ] line at 12.8@xmath1 m , which will be discussed in section  [ lines ] .",
    "the energy peak lies between 30 and 50@xmath1 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed]b ) , which is extremely unusual , even for starburst galaxies .",
    "an even more extreme spectrum ( with an energy peak around 15 - 20@xmath1 m ) has been observed in sbs0335 - 052 , a blue compact dwarf galaxy of very low metallicity @xcite . since sbs0335 - 052",
    "contains one of the most deeply embedded super star clusters known , it may be instructive to compare it with ngc1377 .",
    "their spectra suggest that the geometry of the source may be similar in both systems , compact and sharply bounded .",
    "there are however important differences .",
    "the mid - infrared emission of sbs0335 - 052 between 5 and 10@xmath1 m is very faint , indicating that dust species related to the aromatic band carriers are absent and that very small grains are depleted with respect to big grains @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the mid - infrared emission of ngc1377 accounts for a large fraction of the total infrared power and implies that very small grains are abundant ( even though aromatic band carriers are seemingly absent ) , or alternatively that the radiation field intensity is high enough to heat big grains to very high temperatures .",
    "the optical depth in the amorphous silicate absorption bands is also much higher in ngc1377 .",
    "no other spectral features are seen , except some molecular hydrogen rotational lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h2 ] ) , which will be discussed in section  [ gas ] , as well as a few broad emission features of very low intensity and weak absorption features from gas - phase molecules .",
    "superposed on the deep 10@xmath1 m silicate absorption band , a very weak 11.3@xmath1 m emission band is detected , and likely arises from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pah ] ) .",
    "this feature is well matched by the profile of the 11.3@xmath1 m pah band of the orion bar @xcite , at the spectral resolution of our data .",
    "it may originate from intermediate dust shells , with optical depths lower than the silicate optical depth , but still higher than unity ( see below ) .",
    "the 11.3@xmath1 m aromatic band is always observed in association with other bands , the most prominent of which lies at 7.7@xmath1 m .",
    "the non - detection of the 7.7@xmath1 m band could easily be due to its being hidden in the observed broad 59@xmath1 m bump , which peaks almost exactly at the central wavelength of the aromatic band ( see section  [ model ] ) .",
    "likewise , a 12.7@xmath1 m aromatic band , if present , could be hidden in the broad bump on the red shoulder of the 10@xmath1 m silicate band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "another broad and faint feature is seen below the 17.03@xmath1 m h@xmath33 line , at the bottom of the 18@xmath1 m silicate absorption band ( figure  [ fig : pah ] ) .",
    "it could be composed of the same bands at 17.1 , 17.4 and 17.8@xmath1 m that were shown recently to be common in the interstellar medium of normal galaxies @xcite , and that are thought to be related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .",
    "@xcite have extracted a plateau of blended broad features attributed to the c - c - c bending modes of pahs in this wavelength range ( more exactly between 15 and 20@xmath1 m ) , in compact hii regions as well as young and evolved stars .",
    "they also state that small - size pahs would have sharper spectral structure ( in particular a band at 16.4@xmath1 m , unseen in ngc1377 ) than bigger aromatic compounds .",
    "if the 16.5 - 18.5@xmath1 m bump observed at the bottom of the 18@xmath1 m silicate band in ngc1377 is attributable to pahs , then the lack of substructure would indicate a predominance of bigger aromatic compounds .",
    "finally , we tentatively detect two additional broad features at 6.3 and 6.7@xmath1 m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pah ] ) .",

    "the 6.3@xmath1 m band has been observed in at least two post - agb stars by @xcite and has also been invoked by @xcite to explain the excess emission redward of the 6.2@xmath1 m aromatic band of starburst galaxies .",

    "the as yet unidentified 6.7@xmath1 m band has been observed in ngc7023 @xcite and in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the intrinsic relative intensities of the 6.3 , 6.7 , 1718 and 11.3@xmath1 m bands are similar to what is seen in normal galaxies , then they are not consistent with zero extinction , but would be consistent with an optical depth of the order of half the optical depth affecting the continuum ( which is about 8.5 at 11.3@xmath1 m , as constrained in sect .  [ model ] ) . given the utter uncertainty on the relative geometry of the different dust phases , and the fact that the relative intensities of the aromatic bands are intrinsically variable in various interstellar sources and in galaxies @xcite , the identification of the reported features with pahs is therefore plausible .",

    "to attempt to constrain the geometry of the infrared source in ngc1377 , following the same approach as @xcite for sbs0335 - 052 , we used the dusty radiative transfer model @xcite , assuming a unique , spherically - symmetric source . by construction , aromatic compounds",
    "are not included in the model , and impulsive heating of very small grains is not taken into account .",
    "this shortcoming is partially mitigated by the fact that the dust in ngc1377 is heated to very high temperatures , and thus closer to thermal equilibrium than in normal starbursts , but the results should be interpreted with caution .",
    "however , we note that the effect of neglecting impulsive heating should produce residuals smoothly distributed  in wavelength , not narrow features ( see below ) .",
    "another important limitation is that the same grain size distribution has to be postulated for all dust species , despite the fact that all the families of dust models of the local interstellar medium need very different size distributions for silicates and carbon - based dust @xcite .",
    "since no unique set of geometric parameters will provide a fit to the data , and extensive exploration of the parameter space would be prohibitively long for such a high optical depth as seen in ngc1377 , we restrict the analysis to a qualitative assessment of the density . for the silicate grains , we find that , among the choices available within dusty , the optical properties of @xcite allow the best reproduction of the shape of the silicate absorption bands",
    ". for the carbonaceous grains , graphite , with the optical properties of @xcite , allows a better fit to the spectrum of ngc1377 than amorphous carbon .",
    "figure  [ fig : fit_dusty ] shows fits reproducing the available data from 3.6 to 156@xmath1 m , except in a few wavelength intervals that will be discussed separately below .",
    "the models contain at least 70% of amorphous silicates by number of grains , which corresponds to about 80% of silicates by mass , using the mass densities provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this mass abundance is a bit larger than required by the relevant class of dust models of @xcite ( @xmath34% ) , as well as by the dust model of @xcite ( @xmath35% ) .",
    "such a large fraction of silicates is made necessary in ngc1377 to account for the great depth of the 10@xmath1 m and 18@xmath1 m features .",
    "it can be speculated that this reflects composition changes effected by the intense radiation in the starburst region , silicates possibly being more resilient than carbonaceous grains in an oxygen - rich medium .",
    "the best fits are also obtained for a grain size distribution enhanced in small grains , with a power - law index @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 ( for the standard @xcite distribution ) and a lower cutoff of the order of 10 .",
    "in particular , for a normal size distribution , the opacity would have to be much higher in order to reproduce correctly the 10@xmath1 m and 18@xmath1 m absorption bands .",
    "this may be an artifact of the model , compensating for the absence of impulsive heating .",
    "the model implies an opacity of at least 75 in the v band , more than 20 at the center of the 10@xmath1 m silicate band , and about 10 in the 18@xmath1 m silicate band .",
    "the radial density profile , that was parameterized as a broken power - law , is very steep , with an index of @xmath38 in the center and @xmath39 outside .",
    "the density profile in the outer parts is ill - constrained , and does not allow us to derive a total size . for a bolometric luminosity of @xmath40l@xmath24 , derived from the data themselves by integration over the whole infrared spectral energy distribution , and a temperature of 2000k at the inner surface of the dust shell , the radius of this inner layer is constrained to be 0.08pc , very similar to what @xcite found for sbs0335 - 052 , although the total infrared luminosity of ngc1377 is about three times higher ( the inner dust temperature of the model of sbs0335 - 052 is only 700k ) .",
    "the dust mass derived from the 60@xmath1 m and 100@xmath1 m fluxes , using the galactic emissivity as formulated by @xcite , is @xmath41m@xmath24 .",
    "it can alternatively be derived from the opacity obtained with the dusty model : @xmath42 where the index @xmath43 designates each dust species ( here silicates and graphite ) , @xmath44 is their fraction by number , @xmath45 is their mass absorption coefficient in the v band , @xmath46 is the solid density of the grains , @xmath47 the grain size distribution and @xmath48 the radial density distribution adopted in the model .",

    "* and references therein ) , seems indeed in conflict with the expectation that photoelectric heating will be inefficient in ngc1377 , because small dust grains may be positively charged due to the very intense radiation field .",
    "this effect was observed by @xcite for the [ cii ] and [ oi ] lines at 157.7@xmath1 m and 63.2@xmath1 m , which are among the most efficient coolants of photodissociation regions .",

    "therefore , we expect to observe a maximum of @xmath100wm@xmath101 in the v=0 s(1 ) line .",
    "the observed flux is twice as high .",
    "the intrinsic flux can be much higher , if it is affected by the same optical depth as toward [ neii ] , since gas heated in photodissociation regions would have to be located very close to the hii regions .",
    "the minimum optical depth toward [ neii ] ( section  [ lines ] ) would correspond to @xmath102 .",
    "the intrinsic flux in the h@xmath33 v=0 s(1 ) line would therefore be about six times higher than the model prediction .",
    "this difference is marginal , compared with model uncertainties , in particular on the h@xmath33 collisional de - excitation rates .",
    "however , we note that the br@xmath75 to h@xmath33 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) flux ratio ( which is immune to extinction effects if the emission is nearly cospatial ) is lower than 0.1 in ngc1377 @xcite , which is much lower than expected in the case of photodissociation region heating of h@xmath33 .",
    "for example , the normal starburst ngc1022 has a br@xmath75 to h@xmath33 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) flux ratio of 2.2 .",
    "we thus argue that shock excitation plays a dominant role in ngc1377 , although photodissociation region models are marginally consistent with the present data .    an excitation diagram combining all the observed transitions to date ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diag_h2 ] ) confirms collisional excitation , and allows us to set a constraint on the amount of extinction in the h@xmath33 lines , as explained below .",

    "we also have @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the statistical weight ( with the spin number @xmath111 for even j or para transitions , and @xmath112 for odd j or ortho transitions ) , @xmath113 is the partition function , and @xmath114 is the upper level energy @xcite .",
    "line ratios thus allow the derivation of an apparent excitation temperature : @xmath115 we used the spontaneous emission probabilities given by @xcite .",
    "since the temperature constrained by the rotation - vibration s(0 ) lines and by the rotation - vibration s(1 ) lines is consistent with the temperature derived from the pure - rotation transitions , collisional excitation is confirmed .    in order for the excitation temperature to remain monotonic as a function of the upper level energy ( @xmath116 increasing as @xmath114 increases ) , the equivalent v - band optical depth has to be lower than 17 ( @xmath117 at 17@xmath1 m ) .",
    "this estimate takes into account the errors on the line fluxes , and assumes that h@xmath33 at all temperatures is affected by a same extinction following the galactic center extinction law of @xcite .",
    "since the optical depth in the dust phase is much higher , most of the detected molecular hydrogen must come from intermediate layers . for zero extinction ,",

    "reconciling these ratios by invoking differential extinction effects ( and assuming cospatial emission ) would imply @xmath125 , whereas we have derived @xmath126 for h@xmath33 ( section  [ gas ] ) .",
    "the massive stars in ngc1377 are thus unlikely to have reached the supernova stage . in addition , it is hardly conceivable that a starburst older than 5myr would still be completely embedded , despite the effects of winds from massive stars and supernova shock waves on the interstellar medium . on the other hand , most cosmic rays generated by past star formation episodes",
    "would presumably have propagated over large distances and be located outside the current starburst region , which is very compact , and thus outside of reach of the intense radiation field of the starburst .",
    "their absence is thus more plausibly due to ngc1377 being previouly quiescent for a long period , than to their suppression by inverse compton losses . finally , we know of some ultraluminous galaxies , studied by @xcite , that host very compact starbursts with radiation fields at least as intense as in ngc1377  ;",
    "yet , they are bright synchrotron emitters , which implies that their magnetic field has been amplified to the degree necessary to balance inverse compton losses by synchrotron losses .",

    "a new element is brought by the spitzer data to constrain the nature of the power source . the fact that no high - excitation lines are detected makes the hypothesis of non - stellar activity all the more difficult . in particular , since the [ neii ] line is detected , the undetected [ neiii ] line , affected by almost the same extinction and having a similar critical density , sets a meaningful constraint on the radiation hardness .",

    "the size of the infrared source is of the order of 100pc or smaller , and the new observations reveal that the optical depth in the amorphous silicate absorption bands is one of the highest observed in extragalactic systems : the apparent optical depth at 10@xmath1 m , of the order of 4 , is very similar to that of iras08572 + 3915 , the most deeply obscured object in the sample of infrared - luminous galaxies of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the modelled optical depth of ngc1377 is about five times higher than the apparent depth .",
    "a few absorption bands from dense and warm molecular gas are also present , although very faint .",
    "the new data confirm that ngc1377 has the characteristics of an extremely young , totally opaque nuclear starburst .",
    "it is in such an early phase of this starburst that the only tracer of hii regions yet detected is a very weak [ neii ] line . due to a combination of two effects , suppression of the ionizing photons by dust and high optical depth in the mid - infrared ,",
    "the [ neii ] line probes only @xmath133% of the intrinsic ionizing photon flux of the starburst .",
    "the growth of the hii regions is probably still inhibited by the pressure of the dense interstellar medium , and a large fraction of the massive stars must be still embedded in their parent molecular cloud . in order to reconcile the presence of very massive stars in nuclear starbursts with their nebular line ratios typically indicating low excitation @xcite",
    ", @xcite proposed that in such environments , high pressure causes massive stars to spend a large fraction of their lifetime in ultracompact hii regions , where the production of nebular lines is quelled .",
    "ngc1377 could represent an extreme example of this phenomenon .",
    "galactic systems where the dust competes so efficiently with gas for absorption of the stellar radiation are extremely rare .",
    "if we try to understand the starburst in ngc1377 as a scaled - up version of stellar - size objects ( as a mental picture only ) , the class of becklin - neugebauer ( bn ) objects may represent the closest analogs suited to that purpose .",
    "bn objects are at the transition between massive protostars and pre - main - sequence stars exciting ultracompact hii regions , after the intense accretion phase has stopped , but before the radiation pressure has balanced the interstellar medium pressure @xcite .",
    "the emergent infrared radiation is strongly self - absorbed like in ngc1377 , and molecular hydrogen is excited by shocks , caused by the interaction of stellar outflows with the molecular envelope .",
    "it is unclear whether the same h@xmath33 heating mechanism applies to ngc1377 .",
    "shocks could be caused by the collective outflows and winds of massive protostars and young stars  ; or they could be caused by a merger event , provided the disturbances revealed by optical color maps ( sect .",
    "[ morph ] ) may be interpreted in this fashion .",
    "the optical forbidden line spectrum supports the existence of shocks also in the foreground of the region of activity ( sect .",
    "[ optspec ] ) .",
    "the central neutral density inferred from a radiative transfer model is of the order of @xmath57 hydrogen nuclei @xmath53 , which is not greater than typical densities of giant molecular clouds .",
    "the estimated starburst mass ( see above ) is also very similar to the mass of the super star cluster coincident with the brightest mid - infrared source in the antennae galaxies @xcite , although the latter cluster is more evolved , since it is associated with bright hii and photodissociation regions . in view of these results",
    ", we are not able to determine whether the activity in ngc1377 arises from the formation of a single cluster , or from several isolated pockets . we had been led to the latter hypothesis by the fact that the molecular gas could be unstable with respect to gravitational instabilities @xcite , so that star formation could be triggered almost instantaneously at several locations .",
    "the data are however compatible with the formation of a single stellar cluster in the nucleus .",
    "this question should be more easily addressed for more luminous objects .    at the other end of the mass and luminosity",
    "scale , the infrared spectrum of ngc1377 is indeed strikingly similar to those of some deeply obscured infrared - luminous galaxies ( fig .  [",
    "fig : iras08572 ] ) . ngc4418 and iras08572 + 3915 for instance @xcite share the main spectral characteristics of ngc1377 .",
    "in addition , these luminous galaxies are part of a statistical sample of nascent starbursts that we have selected by their deviation from the infrared - radio correlation and their hot dust .",
    "forthcoming papers will present and discuss the infrared - radio properties and molecular gas content of this sample , based on observations with spitzer , the vla array and the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "the characteristics of these galaxies will be contrasted with those of ngc1377 , serving as an archetype of the nascent starburst class .",
    "their diverse radio continuum properties suggest that they should sample well young starbursts at various stages of development @xcite",
    ". it will be one of our aims to sketch an empirical evolutionary sequence from dust - bounded nascent starbursts such as ngc1377 to mature starbursts such as m82 .",
    "we have previously derived a rate of occurrence of the nascent starburst phenomenon of @xmath134% among galaxies whose flux density distribution peaks at 60@xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "this rate is not in conflict with the expected timescales of star formation .",
    "nascent starbursts , as we have defined them , must fulfill two conditions : their current star formation episode must be younger than 5myr , and they must previously have been quiescent for @xmath7myr . if we note the typical duration of compact starbursts @xmath135myr , where @xmath136 is probably not much larger than unity , then the fraction of starbursts occurring in isolated mode ( as opposed to recurrent mode ) would be @xmath137 .",
    "starburst tracks currently do not incorporate the pre - hii nucleus phase .",
    "likewise , the sets of galactic templates used to interpret the infrared counts in deep surveys do not include objects such as ngc1377 . since",
    "even small changes in the assumed spectrum of aromatic bands in the mid - infrared yield important differences in the interpretation of the counts , as emphasized by @xcite , the consequences of the existence of luminous galaxies sharing the properties of ngc1377 can not be neglected .",
    "this is illustrated by figure  [ fig : zresponse ] , showing the large differences in the redshift - luminosity curve for the 24@xmath1 m mips filter , according to the assumed mid - infrared spectral energy distribution : the curve obtained for ngc1377 is vastly different from those of popular starburst templates .",
    "the nascent starbursts ( selected by their deficiency in radio continuum emission , with respect to the infrared ) are rare objects , in agreement with the brevity of their evolutionary phase .",
    "however , they represent a non - negligible fraction of galaxies with @xmath22 , whose frequency may be much higher at earlier epochs , as suggested by the results of @xcite .",
    "we wish to thank marc sauvage for fruitful discussions , mark wolfire for tirelessly running photodissociation region models to help interpret the data , and nancy silbermann for the timely scheduling of the spitzer irs observations .",
    "support for this work , part of the spitzer space telescope legacy science program , was provided by nasa through an award issued by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under nasa contract 1407 .",
