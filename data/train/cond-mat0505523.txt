    "the spatial and temporal characteristics of the spread of an advantageous mutation are fundamental questions in population dynamics . fisher @xcite and kolmogorov et al .",
    "@xcite first addressed these questions using the framework of a simple reaction - diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "that work and many others focused on the velocity of the propagating front , which exists initially and separates the two spatial regions occupied separately by the two alleles .",
    "both continuum and discrete spatial models have successfully tackled various aspects of these problems @xcite . in this work",
    "we investigate how the advantageous allele emerges from  scratch \" ; i.e. , initially the region is fully dominated by the resident allele and the advantageous allele is introduced by rare mutations . while the mutant allele has an individual - level advantage over the original one , the low probability of mutations , combined with a discrete spatial dynamics , can prevent the spread of the mutant for long times .",
    "here we consider a model where the original  resident \" and the competitively superior  invasive \" allele compete for a common limiting resource preemptively @xcite .",
    "the details of our model are as follows .",
    "we consider an @xmath0@xmath1@xmath0 lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each site can be empty or occupied by a _",
    "allele ( either a resident or an invader ) .",
    "a lattice site represents the minimal level of locally available resource required to sustain an individual organism , hence the  excluded volume \" constraint .",
    "we introduce the local occupation numbers at site @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , representing the number of resident and invader alleles , respectively . by virtue of the excluded volume constraint , @xmath5 .",
    "new individuals arise through local clonal propagation only .",
    "that is , an individual occupying site @xmath2 may reproduce if one or more neighboring sites are empty ( here we consider nearest neighbor colonization only ) .",
    "competition for resources , hence space , is preemptive , therefore , an occupied site can not be colonized by either allele until the current occupant s mortality leaves that site empty .",
    "each individual may mutate and so carry the alternate allele ; mutation is a two - way , recurrent process .",
    "we performed dynamic monte carlo simulations to study the above model .",
    "our time unit is one monte carlo step per site ( mcss ) during which @xmath6 sites are chosen randomly .",
    "if a site is empty , it may be colonized by individuals of allele @xmath7 occupying neighboring sites , at the rate @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the individual - level colonization rate and @xmath10 is the density of allele @xmath7 around site @xmath2 [ @xmath11 is the set of nearest neighbors of site @xmath12 .",
    "if a site is occupied by an individual , it can die at rate @xmath13 ( regardless of the allele ) or mutate to the other allele at rate @xmath14 .",
    "we can summarize the local transition rules for an arbitrary site @xmath2 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 indicates whether the site is empty , occupied by an individual with the resident , or an individual with the invader allele , respectively .    in the simulations , we initialized the system fully occupied by the resident allele ( @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 for all @xmath2 ) .",
    "we are interested in the parameter region where @xmath20 , so that mutation is a rare process , but the invader allele has a reproductive - effort advantage .",
    "then , due to mortality , the system quickly relaxes ( much too fast for mutation to play a role ) to the  quasi - equilibrium \" state where the resident s population is balanced by its own clonal propagation and mortality rates ( in the near absence of invaders ) . throughout the simulations , we track the time - dependent global densities of the two alleles , @xmath21 .",
    "we define the lifetime @xmath22 of the resident allele as the first passage time of @xmath23 to one - half of its quasi - equilibrium value @xmath24 .",
    "as a result of the rare mutations , individuals with the invasive allele occasionally appear in the population .",
    "an invader lacking access to nearby resources may die without propagating .",
    "if a site opens in the local neighborhood ( resource becomes available ) , the invader may colonize it .",
    "however , the empty site is likely surrounded by more than one resident .",
    "the resident s greater local density can compensate for its lower individual - level colonization rate , so the resident has the better chance of colonizing an empty site .",
    "consequently , one expects small clusters of the invading allele to shrink and disappear .",
    "residents , although weaker competitors , can prevail for some time , since preemptive competition imposes a strong constraint on the growth of the invaders .",
    "individuals with the advantageous allele can succeed only if they generate a cluster large enough that it statistically tends to grow at its periphery .",
    "snapshots of configurations and preliminary studies @xcite confirm the existence of a critical cluster size , beyond which the spread of the invading allele becomes statistically favorable .",
    "further , they also show strongly clustered growth of the invading allele . for a given set of parameters , there exists a length scale @xmath25 , the typical spatial separation of invading clusters ; for @xmath0@xmath26@xmath25 the invasion almost always occurs through the spread of a single invading cluster [ single - cluster ( sc ) invasion ] , while for @xmath0@xmath27@xmath25 the invasion is the result of many invading clusters [ multi - cluster ( mc ) invasion ] .",
    "conversely , fixing the linear system size @xmath0 and other parameters ( except the mutation rate ) there is a characteristic value of @xmath14 ( now controlling @xmath25 ) , such that for sufficiently low values of @xmath14 , mc invasion by the advantageous allele crosses over to the sc pattern .     for @xmath0@xmath18@xmath28 , @xmath29@xmath18@xmath30 , @xmath31@xmath18@xmath32 , and @xmath13@xmath18@xmath33 for three different values of the mutation rate @xmath14 ( in increasing order from the top ) .",

    "this framework has successfully described analogous dynamic phenomena in ferromagnetic @xcite and ferroelectric materials @xcite , flame propagation in slow combustion @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , and other ecological systems @xcite .",
    "while local mutation is a poisson process , lacking a hamiltonian or an effective free energy for the model , it is not known _ a priori _ whether the nucleation of a ",
    "supercritical \" cluster will also be poisson . to this end , in the sc regime , we constructed cumulative probability distributions for the lifetime of the resident allele @xmath36 , i.e. , the probability that the global density of the resident has not crossed below @xmath37 by time @xmath38 .",
    "we found that these distributions are indeed exponentials ( indicating that the nucleation of a successful invading cluster is a poisson process ) : @xmath39 for @xmath38@xmath40@xmath41 and @xmath42 $ ] for @xmath38@xmath43@xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the average nucleation time and @xmath41 is the close - to - deterministic growth time until the advantageous mutation dominates half the system .",
    "we show results for a fixed ( sufficiently small ) system size for three mutation rates in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . from the slopes of the exponentials we obtained the average nucleation times [ fig .",

    "the invasive spread is inherently stochastic ; it is initiated and completed by the first randomly nucleated successful cluster of the advantageous allele .",
    "for very low values of @xmath14 , the lifetime is dominated by the very large average nucleation times , hence @xmath48 .    in the mc regime",
    "the invasion processes becomes self - averaging and the global densities approach deterministic functions in the limit of @xmath0@xmath49@xmath50 . at the same time , @xmath51 approaches a system - size independent limit . for large systems we applied the kjma theory @xcite ( or avrami s law ) to predict the density of the resident alelle , @xmath52",
    "our results in fig  [ fig2](a ) show that it is , indeed , a very good approximation .",

    "the measured exponent , @xmath54 , is not too far off [ fig .",
