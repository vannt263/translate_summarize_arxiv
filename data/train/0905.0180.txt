    "@xcite argued that the intermittent phase might be an artifact of the theory , since they did not obtain it in their simulations . in our study , however , the modifications of the theory do not qualitatively change the phase diagram .",
    "the devil s staircase is the general dynamics on a torus ( two - dimensional plane with periodic boundary condition ) .",
    "we believe that the intermittent and synchronized rotations occur at higher @xmath5 than their simulated values .",

    "fluid vesicles also show sw oscillation of the vesicle shape and @xmath0 around @xmath6 between the tt and tb phases by a different mechanism , where the shrinkage of the vesicles at @xmath215 induces a change of the dynamic mode from tb ( @xmath50 ) to tt ( @xmath48 ) in the generalized ks theory  @xcite .",
    "previously , we distinguished that in the sw oscillation of the elastic capsules , @xmath0 is always positive and the shape deformation is negligibly small , while in sw of fluid vesicles , @xmath0 changes its sign and the shape shows large deformation . however , we know now that the condition for @xmath0 is not always true .",
    "the clear difference is the dependence on @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "sw induced by the shape deformation appears only in a narrow range of the viscosity , whereas sw induced by the membrane shear elasticity appears at a wide range of the viscosities with no lower viscosity limit . in the future , it will be interesting to investigate the coupling of different oscillation mechanisms in elastic capsules .",
    "[ sec : sum ]    in summary , we described the dynamics of rbcs in simple shear flow using a simple theory .",
    "the phase diagram of rbcs is divided into three regions : tank - treading , tumbling , and intermediate regions . in the intermediate regions , rbcs exhibit intermittent or synchronized rotations of the inclination angle @xmath0 and phase angle @xmath1 .",

    "the other dynamic properties are not sensitive to the function shape of the free - energy potential .",
