    "big data  the large volumes of data that are now produced in many fields  can present problems in storage , transmission , and processing , but their analysis may yield useful information and useful insights .",
    "this article is about how the _ sp theory of intelligence _ and its realisation in the _ sp machine _ ( section [ introduction_to_sp_section ] ) may , with advantage , be applied to big data .",
    "naturally , in an area like that , problems will not be solved in one step .",
    "the ideas described in this article provide a foundation and framework for further research ( section [ road_map_section ] ) .",
    "problems associated with big data are reviewed quite fully in _ frontiers in massive data analysis _",
    "@xcite from the us national research council , and there is another useful perspective , from ibm , in _ smart machines : ibm s watson and the era of cognitive computing _ @xcite .",
    "these and other sources are referenced at appropriate points throughout the article .    in broad terms , the potential benefits of the sp system , as applied to big data , are in these areas :    * _ overcoming the problem of variety in big data_. harmonising diverse kinds of knowledge , diverse formats for knowledge , and their diverse modes of processing , via a universal framework for the representation and processing of knowledge . *",
    "_ learning and discovery_. the unsupervised learning or discovery of ` natural ' structures in data . * _ interpretation of data_. the sp system has strengths in areas such as pattern recognition , information retrieval , parsing and production of natural language , translation from one representation to another , several kinds of reasoning , planning and problem solving .",
    "* _ velocity : analysis of streaming data_. the sp system lends itself to an incremental style , assimilating information as it is received , much as people do . * _ volume : making big data smaller_. reducing the size of big data via lossless compression can yield direct benefits in the storage , management , and transmission of data , and indirect benefits in several of the other areas discussed in this article . *",
    "_ additional economies in the transmission of data_. there is potential for additional economies in the transmission of data , potentially very substantial , by judicious separation of ` encoding ' and ` grammar ' . *",
    "_ energy , speed , and bulk_. there is potential for big cuts in the use of energy in computing , for greater speed of processing with a given computational resource , and for corresponding reductions in the size and weight of computers . *",
    "_ veracity : managing errors and uncertainties in data_. the sp system can identify possible errors or uncertainties in data , suggest possible corrections or interpolations , and calculate associated probabilities . * _",
    "visualisation_. knowledge structures created by the system , and inferential processes in the system , are all transparent and open to inspection .",
    "they lend themselves to display with static and moving images .",
    "these topics will be discussed , each in its own section , below . but first , the sp theory and the sp machine will be introduced .",
    "the sp theory , which has been under development for several years , aims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence , mainstream computing and human perception and cognition , with information compression as a unifying theme .",
    "the theory is conceived as an abstract brain - like system that , in an ` input ' perspective , may receive _ new _ information via its senses , and compress some or all of it to create _",
    "old _ information , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ sp_input_perspective_figure ] . in the theory ,",
    "information compression is the mechanism both for the learning and organisation of knowledge and for pattern recognition , reasoning , problem solving , and more .        in the sp system",
    ", all kinds of knowledge are represented with _ patterns _ : arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions .    at the heart of the system",
    "are processes for compressing information by finding good full and partial matches between patterns and merging or ` unifying ' parts that are the same .",
    "more specifically , all processing is done via the creation of _ multiple alignments _ , like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ parsing_1_figure ] .",
    "the close association between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability @xcite means that the sp system is intrinsically probabilistic .",
    "each sp pattern has an associated frequency of occurrence , and for each multiple alignment , the system may calculate associated probabilities ( * ? ? ? * section 3.7 ) ( reproduced in ( * ? ? ? * section 4.4 ) ) . although the sp system is fundamentally probabilistic , it can , if required , be constrained to operate in the clockwork style of a conventional computer , delivering all - or - nothing results ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 10 ) .",
    "an important idea in the sp programme is the _ donsvic _ principle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) : the conjecture , supported by evidence , that information compression , properly applied , is the key to the discovery of ` natural ' structures , meaning the kinds of things that people naturally recognise , such as words , objects , and classes of objects .",
    "evidence to date suggests that the sp system does indeed conform to that principle .",
    "the sp theory is realised in a computer model , sp70 , which may be regarded as a first version of the sp machine .",
    "it is envisaged that the sp computer model will provide the basis for the development of a high - parallel , open - source version of the sp machine , as described in section [ road_map_section ] .",
    "the theory has things to say about several aspects of computing and cognition , including unsupervised learning , concepts of computing , aspects of mathematics and logic , the representation of knowledge , natural language processing , pattern recognition , several kinds of reasoning , information storage and retrieval , planning and problem solving , and aspects of neuroscience and of human perception and cognition .",
    "there is a relatively full account of the sp system in @xcite , an extended overview in @xcite , an account of its existing and expected benefits and applications in @xcite , a description of its foundations in @xcite , and an introduction to the system in @xcite .",

    "there are several different computer - based formats , such as , with static images : jpeg , tiff , wmf , bmp , gif , eps , pdf , png , pbm , and more . and",
    ", normally , each kind of data , and each different format , needs to be processed in its own special way .",
    "some of this diversity is necessary and useful .",
    "for example :    * the cultural life of a community is often intimately connected with the language of that community . * notwithstanding the dictum that `` a picture is worth a thousand words '' , natural languages , collectively , have special strengths . *",
    "ancient texts are of interest for historical , cultural and other reasons . * with techniques and technologies as they have developed to date",
    ", it often makes sense to use different formalisms or formats for different purposes .",
    "* over - zealous standardisation may stifle creativity .",
    "nevertheless , there are several reasons , described in the next subsection , for trying to develop _ a universal framework for the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge _ ( ufk ) .",
    "such a system may help to reduce unnecessary diversity in formalisms and formats for knowledge and in their modes of processing .",
    "but it is likely that many existing systems would continue in use for the kinds of reasons mentioned above , perhaps with translations into ufk form , if or when that proves necessary .      of the reasons described here for developing a ufk ,",
    "some relate fairly directly to issues with big data ( sections [ variety_discovery_section ] , [ variety_interpretation_section ] , and [ variety_nl_section ] ) , while the rest draw on other aspects of computing , engineering , and biology .",
    "if we are trying to discover patterns of association or other structures in big data ( section [ learning_discovery_section ] ) , a diversity of formalisms and formats is a handicap .",
    "let us imagine for example how an artificial learning system might discover the association between lightning and thunder . detecting that association is likely to be difficult if :    * lightning appears in big data as a static image in one of several formats , like those mentioned above ; or in a moving image in one of several formats",
    "; or it is described , in spoken or written form , as any one of such things as `` firebolt '' , `` fulmination '' , `` la foudre '' , `` der blitz '' , `` lluched '' , `` a big flash in the sky '' , or indeed `` lightning '' . *",
    "thunder is represented in one of several different audio formats ; or it is described , in spoken or written form , as `` thunder '' , `` gk grlts '' , `` le tonnerre '' , `` a great rumble '' , and so on .",
    "the association between lightning and thunder will be most easily detected via the underlying meanings of the forms that have been mentioned .",
    "we may suppose that , at some level , knowledge about lightning has an associated code or identifier , something like `` ltng ` ' , and that knowledge about thunder has a code or identifier such as `` thdr ` ' .",
    "encodings like those would cut through much of the complexity of surface forms and allow underlying associations , such as `` ltng thdr ` ' , to show through .",
    "it seems likely that at least part of the reason that people find it relatively easy to recognise , without being told , that there is an association between lightning and thunder is that , in our brains , there is some uniformity in the way different kinds of knowledge are represented and processed , without awkward inconsistencies ( section [ knowledge_and_brains_section ] ) .",
    "if we are trying to recognise objects in images , do scene analysis , or otherwise interpret what the images mean , it would make things simpler if we did not have to deal with the diversity of formats for images mentioned earlier .",
    "likewise for other kinds of data .      in many fields ,",
    "there is often a need to combine diverse sources of information to create a coherent whole .",
    "for example , in a study of the migration of whales , we may have , for each animal , a stream of information about the temperature of the water at each point along its route , another stream of information about the depths at which the animal is swimming , information about the weather at the surface at each point , information about dates and times , and so on .",
    "if we are to weld those streams of information together , it would not be helpful if the geographical coordinates for different streams of information were to be expressed in different ways , perhaps using the greenwich meridian for temperatures , the paris meridian for depths , the universal transverse mercator ( utm ) system for weather , and some other scheme for the dates and times .",
    "in short , there is a clear need to adopt a uniform system for representing the data  geographical coordinates in this example  that are needed to fuse separate but related streams of information to create a coherent view .      in our everyday use of natural languages",
    "we recognise that meanings are different from the words that express them and that , very often , two or more distinct sequences of words may mean the same thing or have the same referent : `` the capital of the united states '' means the same as `` washington , d.  c. '' ; `` _ ursus maritimus _ ''",
    "means the same as `` polar bear '' ; and so on .",
    "these intuitions corroborate the need for a ufk , or something like it , which is independent of the words in any natural language .",
    "again , it is widely recognised that , if machine translation of natural languages is ever to reach the standard of good human translators , it will be necessary to provide some kind of _ interlingua_an abstract language - independent representation  to express the meaning of the source language and to serve as a bridge between the source language and the target language .",
    "any such interlingua is likely to be similar to or the same as a ufk .",
    "the need for standardisation in the representation of knowledge is recognised in writings about the _ semantic web _",
    "( eg , @xcite ) , the _ internet of things _",
    "( eg , @xcite ) , and in the okkam project , aiming to create unique identifiers for a global _ web of entities_. , information retrieved 2014 - 03 - 24 . ]",
    "the continual creation of new formalisms and new formats for information and their subsequent obsolescence can mean that old data , which may include data of great value , may become unreadable or otherwise unusable .",
    "a ufk would help to reduce or eliminate this problem .",
    "in keeping with the long tradition in engineering of borrowing ideas from biology , the structure and functioning of brains provide reasons for trying to develop a ufk :    * since brains are composed largely of neural tissue , it appears that neurons and their inter - connections , with glial cells , provide a universal framework for the representation and processing of all kinds of sensory data and all other kinds of knowledge .",
    "* in support of that view is evidence that one part of the brain can take over the functions of another part ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that there are some general principles operating across several parts of the brain , perhaps all of them .",
    "* most concepts are an amalgam of several different kinds of data or knowledge .",
    "for example , the concept of a `` picnic '' combines the sights , sounds , tactile and gustatory sensations , and the social and logistical knowledge associated with such things as a light meal in pleasant rural surroundings . to achieve that kind of seamless integration of different kinds of knowledge",
    ", it seems necessary for the human brain to be or to contain a ufk .      in the sp programme",
    ", the aim has been to create a system that , in accordance with occam s razor , combines conceptual _ simplicity _ with descriptive or explanatory _ power _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.3 ) , ( * ? ? ? * section 2 ) .",
    "although the sp computer model is relatively simple  its `` exec '' file requires less than 500 kb of storage space  and despite the great simplicity of sp _ patterns _ as a vehicle for knowledge ( section [ introduction_to_sp_section ] ) , the sp system , without additional programming , may serve in the representation and processing of several different kinds of knowledge :    * _ syntax and semantics of natural languages_. the system provides for the representation of syntactic rules , including discontinuous dependencies in syntax , and for the parsing and production of language ( * ? ? ?",

    "* section 9.1 ) . * _ networks and trees_. the sp system supports the representation and processing of such things as hierarchical and network models for databases ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) , and probabilistic decision networks and decision trees ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.5 ) . and",
    "it has advantages as an alternative to bayesian networks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.8 ) ( reproduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 10.2 , 10.3 , and 10.4 ) ) . * _ relational knowledge_. the system supports the representation of knowledge with relational tuples , and retrieval of information in the manner of query - by - example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) , and it has some apparent advantages compared with the relational model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2.3 ) . * _ rules and reasoning_. the system supports several kinds of reasoning , with the representation of associated knowledge .",
    "examples include one - step ` deductive ' reasoning , abductive reasoning , chains of reasoning , reasoning with rules , nonmonotonic reasoning , and causal diagnosis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) . *",
    "_ patterns and pattern recognition_. the sp system has strengths in the representation and processing of one - dimensional patterns ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9 ) , and it may be applied to medical diagnosis , viewed as a pattern recognition problem @xcite . * _ images_. although the sp computer model has not yet been generalised to work with patterns in two dimensions , there is clear potential for the sp system to be applied to the representation and processing of images and other kinds of information with a 2d form .",
    "this is discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 13.2.1 ) and also in @xcite . * _ structures in three dimensions_. it appears that the multiple alignment framework may be applied to the representation and processing of 3d structures via the stitching together of overlapping 2d views ( * ? ? ?",

    "_ procedural knowledge_. the sp system can represent simple procedures ( actions that need to be performed in a particular sequence ) ; it can model such things as ` variables ' , ` values ' , ` types ' , ` function with parameters ' , repetition of operations , and more ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.6.1 ) ; and it has potential to represent sets of procedures that may be performed in parallel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.6.3 ) .",
    "these representations may serve to control real - world operations in sequence and in parallel .    as a candidate for the role of ufk , the sp system has other strengths :    * because of the generality of the concept of information compression via the matching and unification of patterns , there is reason to believe that the system may be applied to the representation and processing of all kinds of knowledge , not just those listed above .",
    "* because all kinds of knowledge are represented in one simple format ( arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions ) , and because all kinds of knowledge are processed in the same way ( via the creation of multiple alignments ) , the system provides for the seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge , in any combination ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7 ) . * because of the system s existing and potential capabilities in learning and discovery ( section [ learning_discovery_section ] ) , it has potential for the automatic structuring of knowledge , reducing or eliminating the need for hand crafting , with corresponding benefits in terms of speed , cost , and reducing errors . * for reasons given in section [ visualisation_section ] ) , the sp system may facilitate the visualisation of structures and processes via static and moving images .    in summary , the relative simplicity of the sp system , its versatility in the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge , its provision for seamless integration of different kinds of knowledge in any combination , the system s potential for automatic structuring of knowledge , and for the visualisation of structures and processes , makes it a good candidate for development into a ufk .",
    "the sp system , or any other ufk , may be used in two distinct ways :    * _ standardisation in the representation of knowledge_. there is potential , on relatively long timescales , to standardise the representation and processing of many kinds of knowledge , cutting out much of the current jumble of formalisms and formats .",
    "but for the kinds of reasons mentioned in section [ problem_of_variety_section ] , it is likely that some of those formalisms or formats will never be replaced or will co - exist with representation and processing via the ufk .",
    "* _ translation into the universal framework_. where a body of information is expressed in one or more non - standard forms but is needed in the standard form , it may be translated .",
    "this may be done via the sp system , as outlined in section [ interpretation_section ] . or it may be done using conventional technologies , in much the same way that the source code for a computer program may , using a compiler , be translated into object code .",
    "the translation of natural languages is likely to prove more challenging than the translation of artificial formalisms and formats .    either way ,",
    "any body of big data may be expressed in a standard form that facilitates the unsupervised learning or discovery of structures and associations within those data ( section [ learning_discovery_section ] ) , and facilitates forms of interpretation as outlined in section [ interpretation_section ] .",

    "a strength of the sp system is that it can discover structures in data , not merely statistical associations between pre - established structures .",

    "if the data for learning are text in a natural language , then the product of learning ( section [ product_of_learning_section ] ) will be about words and parts of words , about phrases , clauses and sentences , and about grammatical categories at all levels . likewise with speech .    even with human - like capabilities in learning ,",
    "a * g * that is derived without the benefit of meanings is likely to differ in some respects from a grammar created by a linguist who can understand what the text means .",
    "this is because there are subtle interdependencies between syntax and semantics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 ) which can not be captured from text on its own , without information about meanings .",
    "the sp system may be applied to learning about the non - syntactic world : objects and their interactions , scenery , music , games , and so on .",
    "these have an intrinsic interest that is independent of natural language , but they are also the things that people talk and write about : the non - syntactic meanings or semantics of natural language .",
    "some aspects of this area of learning are discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 13.2.1 ) and @xcite .      of course , for any natural language to be effective , syntax must connect with semantics .",
    "examples that show how syntax and semantics may work together in the multiple alignment framework , in both the analysis and production of language , are presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.7 ) . as noted in section [ sp_as_ufk_section ] , seamless integration of different kinds of knowledge",
    "is facilitated by the use of one simple format for all kinds of knowledge and a single framework  multiple alignment  for processing diverse kinds of knowledge .    in broad terms , making the connection between syntax and semantics means associational learning , no different in principle from learning the association between lightning and thunder ( section [ variety_discovery_section ] ) , between smoke and fire , between a savoury aroma and a delicious meal , and so on .    for the sp system to learn the connections between syntax and semantics , it will need speech or text to be presented alongside the non - syntactic information that it relates to , in much the same way that , normally , children have many opportunities to hear people talking and see what they are talking about at the same time .",
    "since speech and text in natural languages are an important part of big data , it is clear that if the sp system , or any other learning system , is to get full value from big data , it will need to learn from the meanings of speech or text as well as from their surface forms .",
    "for any given body of text or speech , * i * , the first step , of course , will be to derive its meanings .",
    "this can be done via processes of interpretation , as described in section [ interpretation_section ] .",
    "the set of sp patterns that represent the meanings of * i * may then be processed as if it was new information , searching for redundancies in the data , unifying patterns that match each other , and creating a compressed representation of the data",
    ". then it should be possible to discover such things as the association between lightning and thunder ( section [ variety_discovery_section ] ) , regardless of how the data was originally presented .",
    "by contrast with unsupervised learning , which compresses a body of information ( * i * ) to create * g * and * e * , the concept of _ interpretation _ in this article means processing * i * in conjunction with a pre - established grammar ( * g * ) to create a relatively compact encoding ( * e * ) of * i*.    depending on the nature of * i * and * g * , the process of interpretation may be seen to achieve such things as pattern recognition , information retrieval , parsing or production of natural language , translation from one representation to another , several kinds of reasoning , planning , and problem solving .",
    "some of these were touched on briefly in section [ sp_as_ufk_section ] .",
    "here is a little more detail :    * _ pattern recognition_. with the sp system , pattern recognition may be achieved : at multiple levels of abstraction ; with `` family resemblance '' or polythetic categories ; in the face of errors of omission , commission or substitution in data ; with the calculation of a probability for any given identification , classification or associated inference ; with sensitivity to context in recognition ; and with the seamless integration of pattern recognition with other aspects of intelligence  reasoning , learning , problem solving , and so on ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is clear that mature knowledge of a given language , * l * , includes an ability to interpret and , normally , to produce an infinite number of utterances in * l*. it also includes an ability to distinguish sharply between utterances that belong in * l*represented by the middle - sized envelope in fig .",
    "[ generalisation_figure]and those that dont  represented by the area between the middle - sized envelope and the outer - most envelope in the figure .",
    "* the finite sample of language from which we learn includes many utterances which are not correct , meaning that they do not belong in * l*. these include false starts , incomplete sentences , garbled words , and so on .",
    "these utterances are marked _ dirty data _ in the figure .    .",
    "in ascending order size , they are : the finite sample of utterances from which a child learns ; the ( infinite ) set of utterances in @xmath0 ; and the ( infinite ) set of all possible utterances . adapted from fig .  7.1 in @xcite , with permission.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    from these key features ,",
    "two main questions arise , described here with putative answers provided by unsupervised learning via information compression :    * _ learning with dirty data_. how is it that we can develop a keen sense of what does or does not belong in our native language or languages , despite the fact that much of the speech that we hear as children contains the kinds of haphazard errors mentioned above , and in the face of evidence that language learning may be achieved without the benefit of error correction by a teacher , or anything equivalent .",
    "+ it appears that the principle of minimum length encoding ( section [ product_of_learning_section ] ) provides an answer . in a learning system that seeks to minimise the overall size of the ` grammar ' ( * g * ) and the ` encoding '",
    "( * e * ) , most of the haphazard errors that people make in speaking  rare individually but collectively quite common  would be recorded largely in * e * , leaving * g * as a relatively clean expression of the language . + anything that is comparatively rare but exceeds the threshold for redundancy ( section [ product_of_learning_section ] ) may appear in * g * , perhaps seen as a linguistic irregularity  such as ` bought ' ( not ` buyed ' ) as the past tense of ` buy'or as a dialect form . *",
    "_ generalisation without over - generalisation_. how is it that , in learning a first language , * l * , we can generalise from the finite sample of language which is the basis for learning to the infinite set of utterances that belongs in * l * , without overgeneralising into the region between the middle - sized envelope and the outer - most envelope in fig .",
    "[ generalisation_figure ] .",
    "as before , there is evidence , discussed in the sources referenced above , that language learning does not depend on error - correction by a teacher or anything equivalent . + as with learning with dirty data , it appears that generalisation without over - generalisation may be understood in terms of the principle of minimum length encoding .",
    "it appears that a learning process that seeks to minimise the overall size of * g * and * e * normally results in a grammar that generalises beyond the data in * i * but does not over - generalise . both under - generalisation and over - generalisation results in a greater overall size for * g * and * e*.    these principles apply to any kind of data , not just linguistic data . with unsupervised learning from a body of big data ,",
    "* i * , the sp system provides two broad options :    * users may focus on both * g * and * e * , taking advantage of the system s capabilities in lossless information compression , and ignoring the system s potential with dirty data and the formation of generalisations without over - generalisation .",
    "this would be the best option in areas of application where the precise form of the data is important , including any ` errors ' .",
    "* by focussing on * g * and ignoring * e * , users may see the redundant features in * i * and exclude everything else . as a rough generalisation ,",
    "redundant features are likely to be ` important ' .",
    "they are likely to exclude most of the haphazard errors in * i * such as typos , misprints and other rarities that users may wish to ignore ( but see section [ rarity_probabilities_errors_section ] ) . and",
    "* g * is likely to generalise beyond what is in * i*filling in apparent gaps in the data  and to do so with generalisations that are sensitive to the statistical structure of * i * , and excluding over - generalisations without that statistical support .",
    "these two options are not mutually exclusive",
    ". both would be available at all times , and users may adopt either or both of them according to need .",
    "some issues relating to what has been said in sections [ robust_against_errors_section ] and [ learning_with_errors_uncertainties_section ] are considered briefly here .",
    "it may seem odd to suggest that we might choose to ignore things that are rare , since antiques that are rare may attract great interest and command high prices , and conservationists often have a keen interest in animals or plants that are rare .",
    "the key point here is that there is an important difference between a body of information to be mined for its recurrent structures and things like antiques , animals , or plants .",
    "the latter may be seen as information objects that are themselves the products of learning processes designed to extract redundancy from sensory data . like other real - world objects ,",
    "an antique chair is a persistent , recurrent feature of the world , and it is the recurrence of such an entity in different contexts that allows us to identify it as an object .      as we have seen ( sections [ robust_against_errors_section ] and [ learning_with_errors_uncertainties_section ] ) , a probabilistic machine can help to identify probable errors in big data . but",
    "contradictory as it may seem , a consequence of working with probabilities  for both people and machines  is that mistakes may be made .",
    "we may bet on `` desert king '' but find that `` midnight lady '' is the winner . and in the same way that people can be misled by a frequently - repeated lie , probabilistic machines are likely to be vulnerable to systematic distortions in data",
    ".    these observations may suggest that we should stick with computers in their traditional form , delivering precise , all - or - nothing answers .",
    "but :    * there are reasons to believe that computing and mathematics are fundamentally probabilistic : `` i have recently been able to take a further step along the path laid out by gdel and turing . by translating a particular computer program into an algebraic equation of a type that was familiar even to the ancient greeks , i have shown that there is randomness in the branch of pure mathematics known as number theory .",
    "my work indicates that  to borrow einstein s metaphor ",
    "god sometimes plays dice with whole numbers . ''",
    "@xcite . * as noted in section [ introduction_to_sp_section ] , the sp system can be constrained to deliver all - or - nothing results in the manner of conventional computers .",
    "but `` constraint '' is the key word here : it appears that the comforting certainties of conventional computers come at the cost of restrictions in how they work , restrictions that may have been motivated originally by the low power of early computers @xcite .",

    ". both sp patterns and multiple alignments may be displayed as they are or , where appropriate , translated into other graphical forms such as tree structures , networks , tables , plans , or chains of inference . *",
    "_ transparency in processing_. in building multiple alignments and deriving grammars and encodings , the sp system creates audit trails .",
    "these allow the processes to be inspected and could , with advantage , be displayed with moving images to show how knowledge structures are created . *",
    "_ the donsvic principle_. as previously noted , the sp system aims to realise the donsvic principle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) and is proving successful in that regard .",
    "this means that structures created or discovered by the system  entities , classes of entity , and so on  should be ones that people regard as natural .",
    "those kinds of structures are also likely to be ones that are well suited to representation with static or moving images .",
    "as mentioned in section [ introduction_to_sp_section ] , it is envisaged that the sp computer model will provide the basis for the development of a new version of the sp machine . how things may develop is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ sp_machine_figure ] .",
    "it is envisaged that this new version will be realised as a software virtual machine , hosted on an existing high - performance computer , that it will employ high levels of parallelism , that it will be accessible via a user - friendly interface from anywhere in the world , that all software will be open source , and that users will be able to create new versions of the system .",
    "this high - parallel , open source version of the sp machine will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it .        as argued persuasively in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 5 and 6 ) , and echoed in this article in sections [ potential_efficiency_ic_section ] and [ data - centric_computing_section ] , getting a proper grip on the problem of big data will probably require the development of new architectures for computers .",
    "but there is plenty that can be done with existing computers .",
    "most of the developments proposed in this article may be pursued without waiting for the development of new kinds of computer .",
    "likewise , many of the potential benefits and applications of the sp system , described in @xcite and including such things as intelligent databases @xcite and new approaches to medical diagnosis @xcite , may be realised with existing kinds of computer .",
    "the sp system , designed to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence , mainstream computing , and human perception and cognition , has potential in the management and analysis of big data .",
    "the sp system has potential as a _ universal framework for the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge _ ( ufk ) , helping to reduce the problem of variety in big data : the great diversity of formalisms and formats for knowledge , and how they are processed .",

    "apart from several indirect benefits described in this article , information compression in the sp system is likely to yield direct benefits in the storage , management , and transmission of big data by making it smaller .",
    "the system has potential for substantial additional economies in the transmission of data ( via the separation of encoding from grammar ) , and for substantial gains in computational efficiency ( via information compression and probabilities , and via a synergy with data - centric computing ) , with consequent benefits in energy efficiency , greater speed of processing with a given computational resource , and reductions in the size and weight of computers .",
