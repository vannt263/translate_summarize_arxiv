    "the emergence of new frontiers of research in functional genomics , molecular evolution , intracellular and dynamic imaging , systems neuroscience , complex diseases , and the system - level integration of signal - transduction and regulatory mechanisms require an ever - larger fraction of biologists to confront deeply quantitative issues that connect to ideas from the more mathematical sciences .",
    "at the same time , increasing numbers of physical scientists and engineers are recognizing that exciting frontiers of their own disciplines lie in the study of biological phenomena .",

    "a number of reports @xcite have highlighted the increasing importance of quantitative skills for students who are planning biomedical careers , and the need to modify and augment undergraduate biology and premedical education accordingly .",
    "recently , the biology community , in _ vision and change in undergraduate biology education _ ( vcube ) , has specified a number of core competencies that all undergraduate biology students should possess @xcite .",
    "these competencies and examples of how each competency might be demonstrated in practice are summarized in vcube s table 2.1 , reproduced here as table  [ vcubematrix ] .",
    "the aamc / hhmi s _ scientific foundations for future physicians _ ( sffp ) specifies similar competencies for premedical students @xcite .",
    "inspection of table  [ vcubematrix ] reveals that undergraduate biology education in the twenty - first century must embrace quantitative and mathematical approaches .",
    "remarkably , many of the specified competencies are those that physicists seek for students to acquire in physics classes . in this context , the two - semester introductory physics for the life sciences ( ipls ) sequence , currently required for premedical students and biological science majors , presents a natural platform where these students could encounter quantitative and mathematical descriptions of biological and physiological phenomena for the first time . where better than ipls to first develop problem - solving strategies ?",
    "where better than ipls to first develop the ability to use quantitative reasoning ?",
    "where better than ipls to start developing the ability to use modeling and simulation ?",
    "where better than ipls to start developing the ability to apply physical laws to biological dynamics ?",
    "where better than ipls to start developing the ability to incorporate stochasticity into biological models ?",
    "indeed , vcube can be read as a call to transform ipls into an engaging and exciting subject that is appreciated as essential to every biologist s undergraduate education , in contrast to biology students current preconceptions .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     clearly , the overall evaluation of phys 260 is about three standard deviations higher than the overall evaluations of phys 150 , phys 170 , and phys 200 , all of which have similar overall evaluations .",
    "( cohen s @xmath0 , 3.0 , and 2.5 for the difference between overall evaluations of phys 150 , phys 170 , and phys 200 , respectively , and phys 260 . ) in turn , the overall evaluations of phys 150 , phys 170 , and phys 200 are nearly two standard deviations larger than the overall evaluation of phys 180 .",
    "( cohen s @xmath1 , 2.0 , and 1.8 for the difference between the overall evaluations of phys 150 , phys 170 , and phys 200 , respectively , and phys 180 . ) at the same time , the work load of phys 150 was more than two standard deviations below the work loads of phys 180 , phys 200 , and phys 260 , which are all similar to each other , while the work load of phys 170 is about one standard deviation greater than those of these three classes .",
    "( cohen s @xmath2 , 2.8 , and 1.8 for the difference between the work loads of phys 180 , phys 200 and phys 260 , respectively , and phys 150 , while cohen s @xmath3 , 0.97 , and 0.95 for difference in the work loads of phys 180 , phys 200 , and phys 260 , respectively , and phys 170 ) .",
    "interestingly , within the evaluations for both phys 260 and phys 150 , for both of which there is a relatively broad range of numerical values for the mean work load and the mean overall rating , there is clearly a strong negative correlation . between these two measures : the smaller the work load , the higher the overall rating , and _",
    "vice versa_. there is also a negative correlation between work load and overall assessment within the evaluations for phys 170 although the range of both is smaller in this case than for either of phys 150 or phys 260 .",
    "this same trend can be seen in the ratings of phys 150 and phys 180 in comparison to each other , both of which follow a traditional introductory physics syllabus , and both of which enroll(ed ) a preponderance of students , taking physics because it is a compulsory requirement of their major , and/or because is a requirement for admission to medical school .",
    "it is not unexpected that the very well - prepared physics - majors - to - be , who learn about quantum mechanics , relativity , and other compelling topics in phys 260 , rate that class considerably more highly than the biology majors and pre - medical students rate phys 150 and phys 180 , where they learn about two - dimensional projectile motion and cylinders rolling down inclined planes .",
    "what is striking from these data , however , is that when this same population of biology majors and pre - medical students is involved in a class , namely phys 170 , which is built on a selection of biologically and medically relevant topics , even when the work load is high , these students then award an overall assessment rating that is comparable to the rating that this same population awards a traditional - syllabus class with a much smaller work load namely phys 150 , and that a population of physical - science or engineering majors - to - be gives to a traditional - syllabus physics class , namely phys 200 .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ feedback ] displays phys 170 students responses when asked about how taking phys 170 had affected their opinion concerning the relevance of physics to biology and medicine , which was added to our survey in 2014 ( 124 responses out of 127 students ) .",
    "gratifyingly , nearly 70% of these students report that taking the class lead to an increased belief in the relevance of physics to biology and medicine : 12% and 22% report that , prior to taking phys 170 , they thought that physics had no relevance to biology and medicine , but that afterwards they believe that physics is , respectively , highly relevant or somewhat relevant to biology and medicine ; 35% report that prior to taking phys 170 they considered physics to have some relevance to biology and medicine , but that after they consider physics to be highly relevant to biology and medicine . after having taken phys 170 ,",
    "only 1% of students persist with an initial opinion that physics has no relevance to biology and medicine .",
    "in comparison to traditional first - semester introductory physics , biological science majors and premedical students give a comparable or higher overall rating ( phys 150 or phys 180 , respectively ) to a version of first - semester introductory physics ( phys 170 ) that significantly adjusts the introductory physics syllabus to incorporate a selection of topics that are much more biologically and medically relevant , even though their work load is considerably or somewhat increased ( phys 150 or phys 180 , respectively ) .",
    "subsequent to phys 170 , these students show markedly increased belief that physics is relevant to biology and medicine .",
    "the number one challenge in teaching phys 170 by far is students lack of facility with algebraic manipulations .",
    "therefore , the first few weeks of phys 170 are , in part , a crash algebra refresher for a significant number of its students .",
    "it is difficult to see how to address this problem at the departmental level .",
    "a related challenge , that emerged early on in the implementation , was complaints from physics colleagues that phys 170 material was too difficult for biology majors and premedical students .",
    "experience has shown that this is not the case , and such complaints have now dissipated .",
    "i would like to express my thanks to the wonderful students who have taken the class , especially titi afolabi , monique arnold , chayma boussayoud , millie chapman , angela chen , betsy cowell , regina de luna , bertie geng , mansur ghani , sabrina gill , caleb huang , syed hussaini , ragini luthra , yamini naidu , maria passarelli , jessica perfetto , faten syed , linda wang , victor wang , christine willinger , zizi yu , and gazelle zerafati , many of whom returned to serve as peer tutors for the next year s class .",
