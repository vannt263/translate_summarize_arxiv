    "the complex systems that we often observe , both in nature and otherwise , are characteristically poised in a delicate balance between the dullness of order and the randomness of disorder . in recent years",
    "a lot of effort has been expended in obtaining quantitative measures which would provide suitable definitions for this complexity .    in a study of the qualitative behaviour of cellular automata ,",
    "wolfram @xcite noticed that there was a class of automata , which he called class 4 , whose members displayed complex dynamical behaviour .",
    "in particular , they seemed to exhibit transients which were arbitrarily long - lived .",
    "wolfram suggested that this behaviour was reminiscent of the undecidability which characterised the halting problem for turing machines .",
    "he conjectured that class 4 automata then might have a universal turing machine embedded within them .",
    "the model of the turing machine has served , in the past , to provide a deeper understanding of phenomena which had been investigated through other means .",
    "the most notable amongst these is the development of the idea of algorithmic information which is the computational counterpart of the traditional shannon entropy .",
    "these ideas have served to provide a quantitative basis for the qualitative notion of randomness .",
    "conceived originally through the efforts of a number of people , it has shed light on some deep issues related to the foundations of mathematics , mainly through the work of chaitin @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we tried to show that cellular automata , with turing machines embedded within them , may not always display complex behaviour . in our present work",
    "we try to demonstrate that the model of the turing machine may at times be too powerful to describe the computational complexity at the edge of order and chaos .",
    "crutchfield @xcite has argued that instead of looking only at the turing machine , it might be wiser to look at the entire hierarchy of machines that computation theory provides us with .",
    "classical computation theory provides a beautiful framework in which models of machines or automata are related to the languages they recognise , which are in turn , generated by their respective grammars .",
    "this hierarchy is known as the chomsky hierarchy .",
    "the turing machines form the top of this hierarchy .",
    "the dynamical systems we study are , the rather well understood , iterated maps of the interval .",
    "we investigate the onset of chaos which is exhibited by the first accumulation of period doubling for the case of the unimodal and bimodal families of maps .",
    "the symbolic dynamics and the kneading theory for these cases are well known @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the language generated by the kneading sequences in these two cases can be recognised by machines which lie lower down in the chomsky hierarchy .",
    "in this section we set up the notation used by mackay and tresser @xcite to describe the onset of chaos at the first accumulation of period doubling .",
    "a unimodal map is , by definition , a continuous map @xmath0 of the interval @xmath1 $ ] into itself , which possess a single turning point @xmath2 .",
    "normally @xmath0 is chosen to so that it monotonically increases in the interval @xmath3 and decreases monotonically in the interval @xmath4 $ ] . with every point in @xmath5",
    "we associate a symbol @xmath6 or @xmath7 depending on whether it lies on the left or on the right of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 is identified with the symbol @xmath8 . in this way",
    "the orbit of any point in @xmath5 under iteration by the map @xmath0 can be associated with a sequence '' at the end as in @xmath9of symbols from the set @xmath10 . the kneading sequence which is defined to be",
    "the symbol - sequence corresponding to the orbit of the point @xmath11 , is of particular importance in the symbolic dynamics .",
    "it has be shown , in the pioneering work of milnor and thurston @xcite , that the kneading sequence controls the possible symbol - sequences that can occur for a given map and that it determines important ergodic properties of the map , like the topological entropy .    in order that we can define the symbol - sequences of interest to us , we need mention here only a single detail from symbolic dynamics .",
    "symbolic sequences can be ordered in a way , such that they respect the ordering of the interval @xmath5 _ i.e. _ if @xmath12 have symbol - sequences @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , then @xmath15 this ordering is defined as follows :    first we define an ordering on the symbols as @xmath16 .",
    "now , if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two sequences , for which x is the common prefix - sequence and @xmath19 then @xmath20    it is well known that families of unimodal maps ( like the well - known logistic family ) exhibit the route to chaos through period - doubling transitions .",
    "the renormalisation group theory pioneered by feigenbaum @xcite provides a beautiful description of this phenomenon . for our purposes it suffices to describe the kneading sequences that arise through successive applications of the renormalisation group transformation .",
    "the limit sequence then can be thought of as the symbolic description of the onset of chaos , obtained through an accumulation of period - doubling transformations .",
    "the algorithm for generating these sequences is as follows : @xmath21 where the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are chosen from @xmath24 so that @xmath25 we mention that this algorithm generates the kneading sequences @xmath26 of maps , having a superstable periodic orbit of period @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the set of periods of periodic points of the map with the kneading sequence @xmath28 , is given by @xmath29 .",
    "each of these maps have a finite , stable attracting set and hence display ordered dynamics .",
    "we also define another set of kneading sequences which would be useful for the discussion @xmath30 the sequence @xmath31 represents a map which contains an orbit of period @xmath32 .",
    "these maps have positive topological entropy and can , in this sense , be considered as displaying chaotic dynamical behaviour .",
    "the sequence @xmath33 , is the kneading sequence of the map at the onset of chaos .",
    "the set of periods , of the periodic points of this map is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the topological entropy in this case is zero .    for the details of these results , we refer the reader to the literature @xcite .",
    "we now describe the accumulation of period - doubling in bimodal maps through their symbolic dynamics .",
    "once again we refer the interested reader to @xcite for the details .",
    "a bimodal map of the interval @xmath5 , is a map @xmath0 from @xmath5 into itself with two turning points , @xmath2 and @xmath35 . in what follows",
    "we consider the case of the @xmath36 maps , _",
    "i.e. _ maps which are monotonic increasing on @xmath37 and @xmath38 , monotonic decreasing on @xmath39 .",
    "each point in @xmath5 is now associated with a symbol from the set @xmath40 depending on whether it belongs to the interval @xmath37 , @xmath39 or @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the points @xmath2 and @xmath35 are assigned the symbols @xmath41 respectively .",
    "the symbol - sequence corresponding to the orbit of a point , consists of a string of symbols from the set @xmath42 . in this case",
    ", the kneading data of a map corresponds to a pair of kneading sequences , which correspond to the symbol - sequences of the pair of points @xmath43 . as mentioned before , the kneading data uniquely determine some important properties of the map .    the definition of the ordering on symbol - sequences for the unimodal case from the previous section , can be retained verbatim for the bimodal case , if we define the ordering on the elementary symbols as @xmath44 .",
    "the parity of common prefix of two symbol strings is still determined by the number of @xmath7 s in it .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath7 corresponds to the symbol for that portion of the interval @xmath5 , on which @xmath0 is monotonic decreasing .",
    "thus defined , the ordering on symbol- sequences respects the ordering on the interval as before .",
    "we now give the description of the onset of chaos , corresponding to the first accumulation of period - doubling for bimodal maps .",
    "we define operations @xmath45 and @xmath46 on pairs @xmath47 of finite ( possibly empty ) sequences of @xmath40 by @xmath48 where @xmath49 are chosen from @xmath50 so that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are chosen from @xmath24 so that @xmath53 .    given a finite sequence @xmath54 of @xmath45 s and @xmath46 s , we define @xmath55 and write @xmath56 for the @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "pairs @xmath59 of sequences ( possibly infinite ) over the symbol - set @xmath60 can be put into a one - to - one correspondence with points in the unit square ( see figure 1(_i _ ) ) , which we denote by @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 , we define a _ wedge _ ( see figure 1(_ii _ ) ) @xmath63 then define @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the length of @xmath54 .",
    "all maps on the boundaries of the wedges defining @xmath66 have a singly superstable , period @xmath67 orbit passing through @xmath8 or @xmath68 .",
    "we also define regions @xmath69 , such that @xmath70 contains maps which have certain period @xmath71 orbits .",
    "the definitions of these @xmath70 is cumbersome .",
    "we reproduce it here for completeness .",
    "@xmath72 while for @xmath73 , @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the regions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are shown in figure 1(_iii _ ) .    with these definitions , following @xcite , we define subsets of @xmath61 , which will serve as the regions of order and chaos . @xmath78",
    "theorem 1 of @xcite tells us , that the set of periods of a map contained in the region @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 for some @xmath81 .",
    "moreover all such maps are contained within it . thus maps within this region exhibit ordered dynamics ( and have zero topological entropy ) .",
    "on the other hand , a map contained in the region @xmath82 has at least one periodic orbit with a period , which is not a power of @xmath83 .",
    "moreover all such maps belong to this region and have positive topological entropy .",
    "hence , we consider @xmath84 as the region of chaos .",
    "the set of periods of a map in the boundary @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 .",
    "again , the converse is also true in this case .",
    "we will consider @xmath85 as the `` boundary '' of order and chaos . whether it is a boundary , in a precise topological sense , of the regions @xmath79 and",
    "@xmath82 is a long - standing conjecture .",
    "the classical theory of automata and formal languages , has its roots , on the one hand , in the work of turing , church and others who developed the foundations of the theory of computation and on the other , in the work of formal linguists , notably chomsky . in the present section we present a brief outline of this very large body of work , with an emphasis on that part which will be relevant for our purpose . for the details the reader",
    "is referred to the classic book by hopcroft and ullman @xcite .",
    "the entities that automata theory deals with are formal descriptions of devices which can perform `` mechanical '' tasks of varying degrees of difficulty .",
    "these devices usually , have an input tape containing symbols from an alphabet , a memory unit and an auxiliary tape which is used to perform storage and output .",
    "the dynamics of the automaton is described by defining the action(s ) to be performed , depending on the symbol being currently read on the input tape , the present memory state and the current symbol on the storage tape .",
    "these actions might entail a change of the memory state , alteration of the current symbol on the storage tape and motion along the input tape in either direction .",
    "the turing machine is probably the best known example of an automaton .",
    "the thesis of church and turing states that it is equivalent to any other system that can perform a task that can be defined algorithmically .",
    "the central column in figure 2 shows various classes of automata , that form a hierarchy of machines in terms of their computational power .",
    "formal languages are sets , containing finite strings ( called words ) of symbols from some ( finite ) alphabet . the most common examples of formal languages are the programming languages that are used today .",
    "these are contained in the class of formal languages called the context - free languages .",
    "one way of describing formal languages , is through the grammars that generate them .",
    "a grammar contains , not only the symbols which form the words in the language that it generates ( these are called terminal symbols ) , but also an auxiliary set of symbols , called the non - terminal symbols .",
    "the `` productions '' of the grammar , form the rules by which a given string of terminals and non - terminals , can generate another string of terminals and non - terminals . a special non - terminal",
    "( usually denoted by @xmath87 ) is designated the `` start '' symbol . any string formed from the terminal symbols only",
    ", that can be obtained from the `` start '' symbol , by applying the productions successively , is a valid word in the language .",
    "the columns on the left and right in figure 2 , show a hierarchy of the classes of languages and their generative grammars .",
    "it is a beautiful fact of computation theory that the languages generated by the different grammars , are also `` recognised '' by the various classes of automata shown in figure 2 .",
    "this hierarchy of languages , grammars and machines goes under the name of the chomsky hierarchy .",
    "a very natural problem that arises in computation theory , is to determine the class in which a given language belongs . for this purpose",
    ", the theory provides a powerful set of results which are called intercalation theorems or sometimes pumping lemmas .",
    "these are necessary conditions for a language to belong to a particular class .",
    "the usual application of a pumping lemma is to exclude a given language from a certain class .",
    "most commonly , the form of a pumping lemma is as follows : given any word belonging to a language ( in a certain class ) , it is possible to find a sub - word(s ) , of this word , of length not greater than @xmath35 ( an integer that depends only on the language and not the word ) such that all the words obtained by `` pumping '' ( _ i.e. _ adding another copy of the sub - word at its position in the given word ) the sub - word finitely often , would all belong to the language . in the next section we use the pumping lemmas for the one - way , non - deterministic stacked languages and the indexed languages .",
    "in this section we present the main results of this paper and their proofs .",
    "we first define formal languages corresponding to the onset of chaos in the unimodal and bimodal cases and then obtain the classes in the chomsky hierarchy where these languages occur .",
    "the key ingredient in each proof is a relevant pumping lemma . as the statements of these lemmas",
    "are rather involved , we will use the lemma and refer the reader to the literature for its precise statement .      in the notation of section 2.1",
    ", we introduce a sequence of languages @xmath88 .",
    "the words in these languages are formed from the alphabet @xmath89 .",
    "moreover for each @xmath81 , @xmath90 is finite and is contained in @xmath91 .",
    "thus each @xmath90 is a regular language .",
    "the limit language @xmath92 can be thought of as a symbolic description of the edge of order and chaos corresponding to the sequence of period - doublings of unimodal maps .",
    "our concern here is to describe the place , that this language has in the `` extended '' chomsky hierarchy .",
    "this is summarised by the following theorem ,    0.25 in * theorem 4.1 *    1 .",
    "@xmath92 is not a one - way , non - deterministic stack language .",
    "@xmath92 is an indexed language .",
    "proof :    _ ( i ) _ we use the pumping lemma for one - way , non - deterministic stack languages , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath92 is a one - way , non - deterministic stacked language .",
    "consider the integer @xmath35 in theorem 1 ( henceforth referred to as og1 ) of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath93 be a word in @xmath92 of length greater than @xmath35 .",
    "the pumping lemma then guarantees the existence of a string of words @xmath94 obtained by intercalating strings within @xmath93 as described in og1 .",
    "if @xmath95 denotes the length of the word @xmath96 , we have from og1 , for all @xmath97 , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the sum of the lengths of all the @xmath100 s , @xmath101 s , @xmath102 s , @xmath103 s , @xmath104 s and @xmath105 is the sum of all @xmath106 s that appear in the definitions of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "hence the set @xmath118 has an infinite number of prime divisors ( this is rather easy to prove ) . but from ( [ p ] ) @xmath119 is contained in @xmath120 .",
    "this leads to a contradiction and completes the proof .    0.25 in    _ ( ii ) _ the simplest proof of the fact that @xmath92 in an indexed language is probably obtained by observing that @xmath92 is a @xmath121 language ( see @xcite pg .",

    "0.075 in step(3)-(8 ) : determine @xmath204 for an @xmath54 on @xmath200    for an @xmath54 that has been written on tape @xmath200 , we wish to determine the corresponding @xmath205 . these will be stored on tapes @xmath206 to @xmath207 respectively . as the process is recursive we can use auxiliary tapes @xmath208 for each main storage tape . while the determination of @xmath209 requires mere copying from one tape to another , the determination of @xmath57 will require the determination of the parity of the number of @xmath7 s in @xmath209 .",
    "0.075 in step(9 ) : determine the word corresponding to @xmath66 in @xmath165 .    for each @xmath54 the wedges that occur in the definition of @xmath66",
    "are easily obtained by copying the @xmath210 in the relevant order to @xmath211 .",
    "control then returns to steps(3)-(8 ) where @xmath205 corresponding to the next @xmath54 are obtained and so forth .",
    "after this the word in @xmath212 is compared symbol - by - symbol with that in @xmath194 . if it is the same the machine halts in a final state or else it halts in a non - final state .",
    "we observe that if @xmath213 , then each step in the process described above , could be carried out on the bounded set of tapes that was available .",
    "thus if during any of these steps , a head reaches the end of a particular storage - tape , we are guaranteed that @xmath214 and the machine would halt in a non - final state , rejecting the word .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let us first consider the description of the onset of chaos in the unimodal case .",
    "it might seem at first sight that the description of this set by means of the language @xmath92 as being rather _ ad hoc_. in fact instead of choosing to approach the accumulation point through a sequence of superstable bifurcations , we might as well have chosen any of the other sequences available .",
    "however , it is easy to see that the kneading sequences within a periodic window are very simply related to each other . we could in fact have included every kneading sequence less than @xmath215 to form a new language @xmath216 .",
    "this new language would be described simply as @xmath217 where @xmath218 ( @xmath219 ) denotes the language containing the kneading sequences to the left ( resp .",
    "right ) of the superstable sequences in each periodic window .",
    "a proof almost identical to the one given for @xmath92 however shows that both @xmath218 and @xmath219 ( and hence @xmath216 ) are indexed languages .",
    "a more pertinent question is what happens if we are to approach the onset of chaos from the chaotic side .",
    "this question is rather tricky . for",
    "the sake of discussion let us fix the family of maps to be the logistic family , described by the equation @xmath220 .",
    "it will be clear that everything would go through for a much larger class of maps as well .",
    "we could approach the accumulation point @xmath221 from the right through a sequence of band - merging points .",
    "the kneading sequences at these points are most conveniently described by the so called @xmath222-operation , originally discovered by derrida , pomeau and gervois @xcite .",
    "we give here the definition which best suits our purpose . given a word @xmath223 on the symbols @xmath224 , @xmath225 is obtained by applying the following transformations simultaneously on every symbol of @xmath223 : @xmath226 we begin with the region of well - developed chaos at @xmath227 .",
    "the kneading sequence at this point is @xmath228 .",
    "the band - merging points are then obtained through successive applications of the @xmath222-operator as @xmath229 now consider the language @xmath230 .",
    "we could think of this language as another description of the edge of chaos , this time from the region greater than @xmath221 .",
    "in fact the definition of the @xmath222-operator immediately confirms that this is a @xmath121 language and hence is also an indexed language ( see @xcite ) . note that we could have discussed the languages @xmath127 and @xmath231 using the @xmath222-operation as well ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we could now ask the same question that we asked before .",
    "what about other descriptions of the onset of chaos from the chaotic part of the spectrum ?",
    "we do not at present have any good answer to this question . as a preliminary observation",
    "we might note that we could have chosen to approach the onset of chaos through the kneading sequences @xmath31 described in section 2.1 and could have described yet another language @xmath232 .",
    "of course this language is also an indexed language .    however , there is in fact a crucial difference between the language @xmath92 and the languages @xmath233 or or @xmath234 , which , though obvious , might be well worth pointing out : each word in @xmath127 describes a stable periodic point , whereas that in @xmath235 describes an unstable periodic point . in the chaotic regime",
    "the attracting sets would be described by aperiodic symbol - sequences which are infinitely long . unfortunately",
    ", classical computation theory does not consider within its domain , languages whose words might be infinitely long .",
    "in fact the behaviour of classical computational devices on words of infinite length is very different from their behaviour on words of finite length ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we speculate that a description of computation over the field of reals , when sufficiently elaborate so as to provide an analogue of the chomsky hierarchy might throw light upon these issues .",
    "the recent developments in this direction due to blum , shub and smale @xcite might provide the seeds of the such a theory .    the drawbacks mentioned above also apply to our discussion of the bimodal maps .",
    "we could as in the unimodal case , choose to approach the edge from the chaotic side . in the notation of sections 2.2 and 4.2 ,",
    "the language @xmath236 can be considered as describing the region @xmath85 , thought of as the boundary of the region @xmath84 .",
    "the proof given in section 4.2 goes through almost unaltered even for this case .",
    "thus @xmath237 is a context - sensitive language .",
    "in conclusion we would like to place our results in perspective .",
    "what paradigm do these results suggest for a definition of complexity ? in order to address this question we must first inquire , into the process of description .",
    "the scientific description of phenomena normally involves two aspects .",
    "the first is the specification of the _ model - class_. the second aspect involves the description of the phenomenon at hand , with respect to this model - class .",
    "let us call this process , _",
    "interpretation_. for a description to be `` useful '' we must ensure that that both the model - class and the interpretation have been specified in finite terms .",
    "given this rather simplistic picture of the modeling process we now ask , how complexity arises or , more specifically , why are some phenomena more complex than others ? consider a phenomenon which resists finite interpretation with respect to a certain model class . in order to describe it we would , then , have to construct a `` larger '' model - class .",
    "this could be regarded as signalling complexity .    to illustrate this in the context of our results ,",
    "consider the automata or equivalently the grammars in the chomsky hierarchy as representing model - classes .",
    "let the behaviour of maps ( unimodal or bimodal ) represent the entire class of phenomena to be described .",
    "the symbolic dynamics , giving rise to a language , and the explicit construction of a grammar ( corresponding to a given model - class ) generating that language , at each value in the parameter space , can serve as an interpretation for the phenomenon .",
    "together these constitute a description of the behaviour of the map in question .",
    "now , at the onset of chaos we observe that we are forced to change our model - class ( in the unimodal case , for example , from the regular grammars to the indexed grammars ) .",
    "in fact in our case we have proved , that no finite interpretation can be obtained of the edge of chaos in terms of the older model - class .",
    "this describes the complexity at the onset of chaos .",
    "finally we would like to point out that unlike conventional statistical - mechanics that relies on numerical or quantitative classes ( say using critical exponents ) , the paradigm suggested above favours a more qualitative definition of complexity .",
    "what one is tempted to observe , is that , complexity is not so much a matter of number , as it is of mechanism .",
