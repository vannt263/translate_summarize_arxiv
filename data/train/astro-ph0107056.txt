    "a large variety of exotic objects have been found to populate the cores of the most concentrated galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) : blue straggler stars ( bsss ) , low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , low luminosity gc x - ray sources ( llgcxs ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and millisecond pulsars ( msps ) ( e.g. see bailyn 1995 ) . as most of these objects result from interacting binaries ( ibs ) , their formation is strongly favoured in the dense stellar environment of a gc , where stellar collisions provide additional channels for the formation and evolution of binary systems , e.g. , via tidal captures ( fabian , pringle & rees 1975 ; di stefano & rappaport 1994 ) and exchange interactions ( hut , murphy & verbunt 1991 ) .",
    "+ in this framework , we are performing an extensive search for various by - products of binary evolution in the cores of a sample of ggcs selected on the basis of their photometric properties .",
    "in particular , a large population of bsss ( see ferraro et al . 1997a , 1999 ; paltrinieri et al .",
    "1998 ) and a few faint ultraviolet ( uv ) sources suspected to be ibs ( see ferraro et al . 1997a , 1998 , 2000a , 2000b ) have been already discovered in the framework of an uv survey of a sample of ggcs carried out with the hst ( see ferraro , paltrinieri & cacciari 1999 for a review of the results ) .",
    "+ among ggcs , 47  tuc is definitely the most promising target for this kind of investigation since it harbours a crowded zoo of stellar species , including bsss , lmxbs , candidate cvs and msps . in particular ,",
    "21 bsss have been discovered by paresce et al .",
    "( 1991 , hereafter p91 ) , and confirmed by de marchi , paresce & ferraro ( 1992 ) , guhatakurta et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and gilliland et al .",
    "in addition , 20 msps have been detected by camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , 13 of which are in binary systems .",
    "recently , freire et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented accurate timing position for most of them . moreover",
    ", the cluster hosts a number of unidentified x - ray sources ( verbunt & hasinger 1998 ; grindlay et al .",
    "2001 ) , a dwarf nova ( v2 , paresce & de marchi 1994 ; see also shara et al . 1996 ) and a suspected interacting binary ( @xmath1 ) found in the error circle of a bright x - ray source by paresce , de marchi & ferraro ( 1992)- see also de marchi , paresce & ferraro ( 1993 ) .",
    "systematic searches for variability in the core of 47 tuc have been performed by many groups ( see shara et al .",
    "1996 ; edmond et al . 1996",
    "; albrow et al .",
    "2001 ) , also exploting the large data - base provided by the survey of gilliland which was originally coinceved to search for planetary transits ( gilliland et al 2000 ) .",
    "+ here we report on the results of recent hst uv observations of the core of 47 tuc .",
    "these observations yielded the discovery of a large population of uv objects (  [ sec : res ] ) which significantly expand the list of the interesting objects ( tables  2 , 3 , & 4 ) known to reside in the core of 47  tuc and surely will deserve a more detailed study when higher resolution / sensitivity observations and deeper imaging / spectroscopy will be available . + in addition , we have used the same data - set to search for the optical counterparts to llgcxs and msps in the core of 47 tuc .",
    "the results of this search and all the relative caveats are discussed in section (  [ sec : pos ] ) .",
    "the data - set used in the present work consist of a series of public hst / wfpc2 exposures mapping the core of the cluster 47  tuc , taken through the filters f218w ,",
    "f336w and f439w .",
    "the observing epochs , the filter mean wavelength and width , the integration times and the number of exposures are summaried in table 1 .",
    "the images have been retrieved from the public hst archive after the on - the - fly recalibration with the most recent reference files and tables .",
    "images taken throught the same filter have been combined and cleaned from cosmic ray hits using the automatic wfpc2 _ archive association procedure_. in all the selected observations , the core of 47 tuc was roughly centered on the planetary camera ( pc ) chip , which has the highest angular resolution ( @xmath2/px ) .",
    "we thus decided to focus our analysis on the pc frames only .",
    "note that the f336w images have been taken at a different epoch and with a different telescope roll angle with respect to the f218w / f439w data - sets .",
    "for this reason , they cover only @xmath3 of the _ pc  _ field of view imaged in the other two filters .",
    "the standard procedure described in ferraro et al .",
    "( 1997a ) was adopted . in short , in order to perform a deep search for faint uv objects we used the combined f218w image ( with an equivalent total exposure time of 3200 sec ) as the reference frame for object detection .",
    "the same image was also used as a reference for the frame registration .",
    "the photometric reductions have been carried out using romafot ( buonanno et al .",
    "1983 ) , a package specifically developed to perform accurate photometry in crowded fields .",
    "the object list derived from the f218w image was then matched to the corresponding ones obtained from the f336w and f439w images .",
    "a final catalogue with the instrumental magnitude in each filter and coordinates has been compiled for all the identified stars .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were finally transformed to the stmag photometric system using table  9 by holtzman et al .",
    "figure  [ fig : map336 ] shows the @xmath4 color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) obtained from the photometry of more than 4000 stars identified in the _ pc  _ field of view of the combined f218w image .",
    "as it can be seen , the overall morphologies of the branches in this diagram are deformed with respect to the classical @xmath5-plane . for clarity",
    ", the main evolutionary sequences are labelled in the diagram ( see also figure 1 in ferraro , paltrinieri & cacciari 1999 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : map439 ] shows the @xmath6 cmd , where the f439w detections have been included . + as expected , the cluster emission at these wavelengths is dominated by hot stars . in particular , since 47  tuc is a metal rich cluster with essentially a red horizontal branch ( hb ) , hot hb stars are missing , and the brightest population turns to be composed of bsss .",
    "schematically , two prominent features appear in figure  [ fig : map336 ] and are fully confirmed in the cmd of figure  [ fig : map439 ] : ( 1 ) the population of bsss ( highlighted by open circles ) which defines a clean sequence spanning @xmath7 mag and is reminiscent of the sequences already observed in other uv - cmds like , e.g. , m3 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1997 ) and m80 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1999 ) ; ( 2 ) the large number of uv - excess stars ( marked by filled triangles ) which populate the extreme blue region of the diagram ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "although the observations presented here span three different epochs , an independent search for variability is beyond the aims of this paper and we refer to the extensive work by shara et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , edmonds et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter e96 ) and albrow at al .",
    "( 2001 ) in order to check for the variability of the uv objects found in this work .",
    "+ in the following , we will describe and discuss separetely the results of our analysis of these peculiar populations .      the presence of bsss in the core of 47 tuc is well known since the pioneering uv observations performed with the faint object camera ( foc ) by p91 , who discovered 21 bsss .",
    "most of these identifications are now confirmed by the cmds shown in figure  [ fig : map336 ] and figure  [ fig : map439 ] , which unveil a total of 43 bss with @xmath9 .",
    "magnitudes and positions for these objects are listed in table  2 .",
    "all the coordinates are in _",
    "pc  _ pixel units ( @xmath2/px ) and have been measured in the f218w image reference frame . in table 2",
    "we adopted the bss identification code ( bss # ) originally used by p91 and we followed this numeration for the other candidates successively discovered by guhathakurtha et al .",
    "( 1992 , hereafter g92 ) and e96 , as well as for the additional 20 new candidates discovered in the present work . the original identification number by g92 is also listed in column 8 , together with the one used by e96 to flag variables objects ( namely v1 , v3 , v6 , v10 , v11 , v12 ) .",
    "some of these stars have been successively studied by gilliland et al .",
    "in particular , v10 ( our bss-24 ) was classified as eclipsing variables by e96 , while v12 ( our bss-16 ) was suggested to be a low amplitude sx phe variable in a binary system . on the basis of its light curve shape , v11 ( our bss-26 ) was classified by e96 as an algol eclipsing binary , with a period of @xmath10 day .",
    "the true nature of v11 is not completely understood . indeed , while the cmd presented by e96 shows this object as `` located near the main sequence turn - off '' , our photometry shows that it is in the bss region .",
    "in addition , its light curve is known to show anomalous features like , e.g. , the rapid brightening detected by minniti et al .",
    "+ only three bsss discovered by p91 ( namely bss9 , bss11 and bss17 ) have not been confirmed as bss by our criteria . in particular , bss11 is located in the region between the cluster turn off ( to ) and the bss sequence in figure  [ fig : map439 ] , but it is below the threshold assumed here ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "bss9 ( i d # 2800 in our list ) is the object at @xmath12 and colour @xmath13 located between the bss sequence and the hb .",
    "bss17 ( i d # 1798 in our list ) has been classified as uv - excess star ( uve2 , see section [ subsec : uve ] ) since its location in the cmd ( @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ) is significantly bluer than that of the bss sequence .",
    "the extended colour baseline provided by the cmd in figure  [ fig : map439 ] allows us to further investigate the nature of the uv - excess stars , identified in figure  [ fig : map336 ] .",
    "in particular , we note how the bluest side of the uv - excess star distribution seems to define a sort of sequence .",
    "this would suggest that at least part of the uv - excess stars could be white dwarfs , accordingly with the previous findings by ( paresce , de marchi & jedrzejewski 1995 ) . to check this hypothesis",
    "we have computed the expected location of the wd cooling sequence in the @xmath16 cmd . to do this",
    ", we run the theoretical cooling sequence for @xmath17 hydrogen - rich wds ( wood 1995 ) through the standard iraf simulation package _",
    "synphot  _ in order to derive the uv - colours and magnitudes for the theoretical wd sequence .",
    "a reddening of @xmath18 in the direction of 47 tuc was assumed .",
    "the computed wd sequence is overplotted to the data in figure  [ fig : map439 ] .",
    "as it can be seen , the cooling sequence nicely fits the bluest side of the uv - excess distribution and fully supports the conclusion that about half of the uv - excess stars detected in the core of 47  tuc are indeed wds .",
    "in addition , by comparing the observed wd distribution with the expected location of 3 and 13 million year old cooling wds ( marked by the two open squares along the wd cooling sequence in figure  [ fig : map439 ] ) we can conclude that the wd population discovered here basically consists of very young objects .",
    "+ though the sample presented in figure  [ fig : map336 ] and figure  [ fig : map439 ] is surely affected by incompleteness at least at the faint end of the sequence ( @xmath19 ) , we can try to perform a _",
    "first order _ test to check if the number of the candidate bright wds observed in the central region of 47  tuc is in agreement with the theoretical expectations . to do this",
    ", we computed ( accordingly with the suggestion by richer et al .",
    "1997 ) the number of wd expected in the _ pc  _ field of view by comparison with the observed number of a tracer population with known lifetime ( as the hb ) .",
    "taking into account that in the field of view of the _ pc  _ we observed @xmath20 hb stars , and assuming the hb lifetime @xmath21 ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) , we derive from their eq .",
    "( 1 ) the following relation for our sample :    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the number of wds brighter than magnitude @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the corresponding cooling time in yrs .",
    "according to the wood s models ( wood 1995 ) , @xmath26 yr and @xmath27 yr . thus , eq . ( 1 ) predicts @xmath28 and @xmath29 since from figure  [ fig : map439 ] we count 3 and 12 wds brighter than @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , we can conclude that the agreement with the theoretical prediction turns out to be exceptionally good .",
    "thus , we can reasonably assume that all the objects with colour @xmath32 are young cooling wd candidates .",
    "+ magnitudes , colours and positions for these stars are listed in table  2 .",
    "although about half of the uv - excess stars detected in the core of 47  tuc turn out to be young cooling wds , there is still a significant number of objects in figure  [ fig : map439 ] lying between the bss sequence and the wd cooling sequence .",
    "a zoom of the ( @xmath33 ) cmd is shown in figure  [ fig : mapzoom ] , where we have now marked with large empty triangles the wd candidates identified in the previous section and listed in table 3 . as it can be seen from figure  [ fig : mapzoom ] , there are at least a dozen of uv - excess stars ( plotted as filled triangles ) lying between the wd and the bss sequence . in the following , we refere to these objects as uv - excess stars ( hereafter uve ) . + the identification numbers , magnitudes and positions for the 11 brightest ( @xmath34 ) uve stars are listed in table  4 .",
    "uve-3 has been identified with the blue object v1 ( paresce , de marchi & ferraro 1992 , hereafter pdf92 ) , which is now clearly confirmed to be an object with strong uv emission .",
    "uve-2 was originally classified as a bss ( bss17 ) by p91 .",
    "however , this object is bluer than the bss sequence , an evidence also confirmed by previous cmds of the field ( see figure  5 by de marchi , paresce & ferraro ( 1993 ) , where it clearly stands out from the bss sequence ) .",
    "uve-2 is also the variable pc1-v36 discussed by albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and classified as a semi - detached binary . + in a recent review , ferraro et al .",
    "( 2000a ) listed 10 uve objects ( associated to llgcxs ) detected in the core of 6 ggcs .",
    "the population discovered here is much larger than that previously found in any ggcs ( see paresce et al .",
    "1991 ; paresce & de marchi 1994 ; shara & drissen 1995 ; cool et al . 1995 , 1998 ; ferraro et al .",
    "1997 , 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "moreover , although we conservatively listed in table 4 only the 11 brightest uve sources , a population of _ faint _",
    "( @xmath19 ) uve candidates ( marked as open squares ) is clearly visible in figure  [ fig : mapzoom ] , with more than 30 uve sources counted down to @xmath35 .",
    "unfortunately , the faintness of these objects in all the images prevents to firmly assess their colours . among the _",
    "faint _ uve stars , we have identified the dwarf nova v2 discovered by paresce & de marchi ( 1994 ) and the blue variable v3 ( suspected to be a cv ) discovered by shara et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "v2 ( @xmath36 in our list ) appears in a quiescence state at the epoch covered by the present obervations , as it is quite faint ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) in both the f218w and f439w images .",
    "also the variable v3 ( @xmath39 in our list ) appears to be faint at the epoch of the observations : it is one of the faintest objects in the uv region of the cmd shown in figure  1 and it is not visible in the f439w images .",
    "+ from the number of bona - fide identifications and likely candidates pinpointed by our uv - cmds , we conservatively conclude that _ there is a clear indication for the existence of a large population of faint uve stars in the core of 47 tuc_. this conclusion is supported by additional , independent , observations . while we were writing this paper , a work by knigge et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported on the possible detection of a large population of uve stars ( @xmath40 ) in the core of 47  tuc from far - ultraviolet photometric and spectroscopic hst / stis observations .",
    "the availability of a spectroscopic analysis suggested that these stars ( or at least part of them ) could be cvs .",
    "if this is the case , the uve objects discovered here could represent the brightest extension of the long searched population of cvs predicted by the models ( see di stefano & rappaport 1994 ) and never found by previous observations .",
    "+ however , alternative evolutionary scenarios exist , which can produce objects populating the same region of the cmd .",
    "for instance , edmonds et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that at least one uve star found in the center of ngc6397 ( cool et al .",
    "1998 ) is actually a low - mass helium wd , resulting from the stripped core of a red giant ( castellani & castellani 1993 ) .",
    "most of the exotic objects ( bsss , lmxbs , cvs , msps ) hosted in the core of ggcs are thought to result from the evolution of various kinds of binary systems .",
    "in particular , when a binary system contains a compact object ( like a neutron star or a white dwarf ) and a close enough secondary , mass transfer can take place , producing an ib .",
    "the streaming gas , its impact on the compact object , the presence of an accretion disk can give such systems observational signatures which make them stand out above ordinary cluster stars .",
    "these signatures include x - ray emission , significant radiation in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , emission lines , or rapid time variations .",
    "for this reason , the study of peculiars objects usually benefits from a comprehensive multiwavelength approach .",
    "+ in the case of the uve stars found in other ggcs , some were found coincident with x - ray sources ( ferraro et al .",
    "1997b , 2000a ) while others , like the ones discovered by cool et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in ngc6397 , by carson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in @xmath41-cen and by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2000b ) in the core of ngc6712 , were found to exhibit significant h@xmath42 emission .",
    "these multiwavelength observations allow one to classify uve stars as high - confidence ib candidates and/or probable cvs .",
    "for this reason , it is particularly interesting here to investigate possible associations between the blue populations ( bsss , wds , and uve stars ) , with some of x - ray sources and msp companions which are known to harbour in the core of 47  tuc .",
    "+ since the first guess to claim an optical identification is based on the positional coincidence , @xmath43 and @xmath44-pixel positions of the objects detected in the _ pc  _ have been converted to @xmath45 and @xmath46 using the task metric in the iraf / stsdas package , which also accounts for the geometric distorsions of the pc .",
    "of course , the accuracy on the final coordinates is entirely dominated by the intrinsic error on the absolute coordinates of the gsc1.1 ( _ guide star catalog _ ) stars ( lasker et al . 1990 ) , which are used both to point hst and to compute the astrometric solution in the focal plane . according to the current estimates , the mean uncertainty on the absolute positions quoted in the gsc1.1",
    "is @xmath47 ( @xmath48 level of confidence ) .",
    "thus , we conservatively assume @xmath49 as the global error on the absolute positions of our objects .",
    "+ note that such estimate is consistent with the average difference between the absolute positions of the same set of stars , as measured in independent hst pointings .",
    "for instance , g92 measured the absolute position of its star _",
    "e _ to be @xmath50 and @xmath51 , while star ( @xmath52 in our catalog ) turns out to be at @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e. at @xmath55 from the g92 determination , which fully confirms the uncertainty estimated above .",
    "verbunt & hasinger ( 1998 , hereafter vh98 ) have recently re - analized all the rosat / hri images of 47  tuc obtained in the recent years and finally produced a list of accurate positions and fluxes for nine x - ray sources detected in the cluster core . however , while we were writing this paper grindlay et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter g01 ) reported the discovery of additional @xmath56 100 x - ray sources detected from _",
    "chandra  _ observations .",
    "this catalog , listing 108 x - ray sources with @xmath57 erg @xmath58 , represents the largest and most complete x - ray source catalog ever published in 47 tuc . for this reason , in the following , we will adopt table  1 of g01 as reference list for the positions of x - ray sources in 47 tuc . among these , 36 _",

    "chandra  _",

    "pc  _ pixels using the wfpc2 astrometric solution and we have shifted the g01 catalog to match the position of the _",
    "chandra  _ source w46 ( x9 in vh98 ) with the one of its putative counterpart uve-3 ( v1 in pdf92 ) .",
    "the choice of the v1/x9 pair as a _ fiducial position reference _ is justified by the work of many authors ( see , for example , geffer , auriere & koch - miramond 1997 and vh98 ) , which confirm the physical association between the two objects .",
    "the shift between the two coordinate systems was admittedly small : @xmath59 ( @xmath60   _ pc  _ pixels ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 _ pc  _  pixels ) .",
    "+ after registering the objects coordinates on a unique reference grid , we cross correlated the positions of the x - ray sources with the ones derived here for the blue objects . in this way we found an acceptable ( @xmath63 ) positional coincidence for at least 25 x - ray sources .",
    "the identification of all the possible optical counterparts to the x - ray sources of g01 are listed in table  5 while their positions in the uv cmd are marked in figure 4 . since we intend to use table 5 as a _ working progress list _ and not a definitive counterparts catalog , in some cases we listed two uv - objects as possible counterparts to a single x - ray source ( see the case of w28 , w55 , w80 and w98 ) .",
    "+ it is interesting to note that at least 12 possible optical counterpart to the x - ray sources are _ faint - uve _ stars , suggesting , once more , the existence of a large population of faint ibs in the core of 47 tuc .",
    "we confirm the possible association ( proposed by vh98 ) between v2 and x19 ( w30 in the g01 list ) , and we propose ( in agreement with g01 ) the association of v3 and x10 ( w27 in the g01 list ) .",
    "other position - wise associations appears possible from our data - set ( see table  5 for the complete list ) . in particular , these are the ones between _",

    "+ however , it should be noted that all the positions of the putative optical counterparts could be still affected by residual uncertanties , since the shifts applied to match the v1/x9 pair represent only a first - order correction .",
    "even though , establishing a physical connection supported only on the positional coincidence is risky , expecially because of the large number of peculiar objects found in the crowded core of 47  tuc . in view of all these caveats , we conservatively conclude that the identifications proposed here are possible , and as such useful reference for future investigations , but not conclusive .      freire et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have recently published accurate timing positions ( typical uncertainty @xmath64 ) for 15 msps in the core of 47 tuc .",
    "eight of these pulsars have been found in binary systems and , of these , 3 ( namely msp - i , msp - o , msp - t ) lie in the _ pc  _ field of view .",
    "exchange interactions in the core of the cluster could in principle produce a significant number of systems comprising a msp and a main sequence star .",
    "if the msp is an active x - ray source , its energy emission could also affect such not - degenerate companion , perhaps making it a blue source .",
    "for this reason we cross - correlated the msp positions with our master source list , and we have found interesting matches both with the _ chandra  _ x - ray source and the uv object lists .",
    "first , we confirmed the finding by g01 that three _",
    "chandra  _ sources ( namely w19 , w105 , w39 ) are nearly coincident with the three binary msp ( msp - i , msp - t , msp - o , respectively ) lying in the _ pc  _ field of view .",
    "in addition , we found interesting matches with peculiar blue objects .",
    "in particular , msp - i is at @xmath65 from a white dwarf ( wd-4 ) and msp - t is nearly coincident ( at only @xmath66 ) with a faint ultraviolet excess object ( uve-9 ) .",
    "the case of @xmath67 is more complex .",
    "only a to star ( namely @xmath68 ) has been found at @xmath69 from the nominal position of this @xmath70 .",
    "however , @xmath67 is located in the region of the peculiar binary ako9 ( bss26 in our list , see section 3.1 ) .",
    "unfortunately this objects is relatively far away ( @xmath71 ) from the nominal position of @xmath67 to be considered a promising optical counterpart candidate to this msp .",
    "moreover , the matching with the x - ray _",
    "chandra  _ catalog suggests that ako9 is nearly coincident with another _",
    "chandra  _ source : w36 ( see table  5 ) .",
    "thus , the physical association between @xmath67 and the peculiar binary ako9 appears unlikely . on the other hand , the only other blue object found in its vicinity ( at @xmath72 )",
    "is ako6 ( which corresponds to bss2 in our list ) .",
    "this object did not show significant variability , since it is not coincident with any of the 13 variables detected by e96 .",
    "+ the case of a possible association between msp - i and wd-4 is probably the more intriguing since msp companions in binary systems are indeed expected to be wds ( e.g. see the reviews of verbunt 1993 and phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) , with cooling ages longer than at least a few @xmath73 yrs ( hansen & phinney 1998 ) .",
    "according to its position along the wd cooling sequence , wd-4 seems to be a quite young object , approximately @xmath74 yr old .",
    "it is thus unlikely that it is the companion to msp - i .",
    "although the irradiation of the surface layers of the wd by the msp beam could modify its photometric properties , making it brighter and slightly bluer ( e.g. dantona 1995 for a review ) and eventually producing an apparent rejuvanation , this would require an unlikely variation of 4 - 5 magnitudes to reconcile the cooling age of @xmath75 with the expected cooling age for a typical msp companion .",
    "moreover , the induced brightening of the wd should be recognizable by a strong modulation in its light curve , while its heated surface rotates in and out of the line of sight ( see e.g. stappers et al .",
    "conversely , from the analysis of the f218w images we have not found any evidence for luminosity variation larger than a few tenths of magnitude for @xmath75 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the images analyzed here do not allow a proper time coverage of the orbital period of the msp - i system .",
    "in fact , the f218w images cover less than @xmath76 of the @xmath77 period estimated by freire et al ( 2001 ) . for this reason , we can not exclude variability for this system . + finally , uve-9 is closely blended with a main sequence star , and its photometry turns presently to be too uncertain for allowing further speculations .",
    "+ table  6 lists the absolute positions for the three msps and for the blue sources lying nearby .",
    "however , in none of the above cases the positional coincidence alone is an argument strong enough to support the identification .",
    "indeed , astrophysical and statistical considerations suggest that all of the above positional coincidences are probably due to chance , thus , probably the optical counterparts to these msps are much fainter than the detection limit of the observations analyzed here . + the probabilities of a physical connection between these 3 binary msp systems and the blue objects in their proximity are further reduced if one examines also the optical sources located in the vicinity of the _ single , isolated , _ msps detected in the core of 47  tuc and included in the field of view covered by the pc . although no optical counterpart is expected for these objects , it appears ( see table  6 ) that two of them ( over the three non - binary msp listed by freire et al .",
    "2001 ) , namely msp - f and msp - l , are positionally coincident , within the above uncertainties , with wd-8 and bss-29 , respectively .",
    "+ while reaching fainter limiting magnitudes would certainly help the search to msp companions , the current uncertainties on the absolute _",
    "pc  _ astrometry would still represent the major problem , suggesting that even the availability of much deeper exposures would not solve the ambiguities .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( 1 ) in order to compute the expected number of wd ( younger than a given cooling time ) lying in the fraction of the 47  tuc core covered by the pc . in doing this , we assumed a wd cooling age of 1 gyr , i.e. at the median of the wd cooling age distribution of @xmath78 yrs as suggested by some @xmath79 systems studied in the field ( see hansen & phinney 1998 ; schnberner , driebe & blcker 2000 ) . adopting the wood ( 1995 ) models",
    ", this cooling age corresponds to an absolute magnitude @xmath80 ( which yealds @xmath81 at the distance of 47 tuc ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "( 1 ) gives a total of @xmath82 wds with @xmath83 .",
    "assuming that @xmath62 is the typical uncertainty in registering the msp coordinates on the _ pc  _ frame , the previous number implies an average of 6 wds brighter than @xmath84 within the uncertainty region .",
    "the situation can certainly improved by obtaining a new astrometric solution for the pc using the gsc2.2 ( mclean et al .",
    "2001 ) , which has an average absolute astrometric accuracy of @xmath85 i.e. three times better than the one of the gsc1.1 .",
    "however , even a remarkable improvement of a factor of 3 in the absolute astrometry of the _ pc  _ will reduce the probability of a chance coincidence between the msp and a 1 gyr - old wd , only to a @xmath86 , still too high to claim a position - wise identification .",
    "+ in summary , the conspiracy of the overcrowded field in the core of 47  tuc and the extreme faintness of the expected optical counterpart ( an old wd ) of the companion to a msp makes extremely difficult a firm identification using only photometric colors and positioning .",
    "further hints will be necessary , such as the discovery of photometric modulations due to orbital motion , peculiarities in the optical and uv companion candidate spectra and/or emissivity at other wavelengths .",
    "using data collected with the planetary camera of hst , we have more than doubled the sample of blue stragglers detected in the core of the globular cluster 47  tuc and have reported on the discovery of a large number of uv stars , with the hottest of them being probably young wds .",
    "the others uv objects are _ anomalous _ uv - excess stars whose true nature and evolution can not be satifactorily assessed yet .",
    "in fact many different evolutionary mechanisms involving stellar collisions and interactions could account for them .",
    "high resolution , deeper imaging and spectroscopic observations in the uv ( as those preliminary presented by knigge et al . 2001 ) are required to discriminate among the various models .",
    "however , the large number of positional coincidences with x - ray sources ( from the recent _ chandra  _ catalog ) indeed suggests that part of them could be ibs .",
    "in particular , a significant number of x - ray sources ( @xmath87 ) have been found to be possibly associated with the _ faint uve _ population discovered here , supporting the presence of a large population of faint cv in the core of this cluster .",
    "+ we have also explored the possibility of identifying some of the detected blue objects as the optical counterparts to millisecond pulsar companions hosted in the core of the cluster . however , although a few positional coincidences have been found , none of them is suggestive yet of a physical association .    the financial support of the agenzia spaziale italiana ( asi ) and of the _ ministero della universit e della ricerca scientifica e tecnologica _ ( murst ) to the project _ stellar dynamics and stellar evolution in globular clusters _ is kindly acknowledged .",
