    "<S> the influence of the electron - vibron coupling on the transport properties of a strongly interacting quantum dot built in a suspended carbon nanotube is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is probed by a charged afm tip scanned along the axis of the cnt which induces oscillations of the chemical potential and of the linear conductance . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations are due to the competition between finite - size effects and the formation of a wigner molecule for strong interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such oscillations are shown to be suppressed by the electron - vibron coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression is more pronounced in the regime of weak coulomb interactions , which ensures that probing wigner correlations in such a system is in principle possible .    </S>",
    "<S> when coulomb interaction dominates over the kinetic energy of electronic systems , wigner molecules of electrons can emerge  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after more than 75 years  @xcite , however the details of the appearance of such a strongly correlated state of matter are only partially known : the theoretical modeling and the experimental realization of wigner molecules are still challenging problems  @xcite , even though quantum dots  @xcite , allowed a breakthrough in the problem . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the theoretical modeling is concerned , the description of 2-dimensional ( 2d ) wigner molecules has relied mainly on numerical techniques  @xcite , while in 1 dimension ( 1d ) , aside from numerical techniques  @xcite , analytical methods can be employed  @xcite , mainly thanks to the luttinger liquid theory  @xcite . on the experimental side , in 2d optical spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> has been employed  @xcite ; in 1d transport techniques based on momentum resolved tunneling between quantum wires  @xcite , and on the magnetic properties of the wigner molecule  @xcite have been used . </S>",
    "<S> recently other experimental set ups for the detection of 1d wigner molecules have been proposed  @xcite : the transport properties of 1d quantum dots perturbed by local probes such as afm and stm tips have been demonstrated to be effective in the detection of the wigner molecule . in many of the experimental realizations , quantum dots are however surrounded by metallic gates which unavoidably screen the coulomb interactions , demoting the formation of the molecule itself . </S>",
    "<S> a possible candidate in which screening effects can be dramatically reduced is a suspended carbon nanotube ( cnt )  @xcite , a system in which rather strong coulomb interactions can be attained . </S>",
    "<S> in such a system , however , the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly coupled to the vibrational ones as it occurs in nano - electro - mechanical systems ( nems )  @xcite : is has indeed been demonstrated that suspended cnts can behave as mechanical resonators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a source of fluctuations can potentially be detrimental to the formation of the wigner molecule . </S>",
    "<S> + in this work we investigate the transport properties of a one dimensional quantum dot , built in a suspended and interacting cnt , scanned by a negatively charged afm tip free to move along the axis of the cnt . employing the luttinger liquid theory , we address both the renormalization induced on the chemical potential and on the linear conductance peak by the presence of the afm tip . in the absence of electron vibron coupling </S>",
    "<S> these quantities have been demonstrated to be effective in the detection of the wigner molecule . </S>",
    "<S> we show that care must be taken , since the coupling to a vibron indeed suppresses the oscillations induced by the tip . </S>",
    "<S> however , since electron - electron interaction reduces the effect of the electron - vibron coupling , we can conclude that a strongly interacting , suspended cnt may be an excellent candidate to investigate the physics of wigner molecules . </S>",
    "<S> + as a first step we briefly remind the low energy model for finite size interacting cnts . </S>",
    "<S> it is well established  @xcite that the low energy properties of any finite interacting metallic ( or semiconducting , if the fermi point is not close to the charge neutrality point  @xcite ) cnt can be described in terms of a four - channel luttinger liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian ( @xmath0 ) @xmath1 is @xmath2 , with  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the fermi velocity and @xmath6 is the luttinger liquid parameters of each channel , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for a metallic cnt @xmath9  </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath10 is the number of excess electrons in the channel @xmath11 with @xmath12 the total number of excess electrons , and @xmath13 is due to the inclusion of a gate contact capacitively coupled to the dot . </S>",

    "<S> + when the cnt is suspended the interplay between the electronic and the mechanical degrees of freedom must be addressed . among the possible quantized oscillation modes ( vibrons )  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the most relevant for the electronic properties considered in this work are the lowest stretching ones  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> + in terms of the above quantities , the differential conductance @xmath187 is given by  @xcite @xmath188 the factor 4 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cond ] ) stems from the fourfold degeneracy of the ground state with @xmath189 electrons . </S>",

    "<S> ( a ) corrections to the chemical potential @xmath191 ( units @xmath192 ) as a function of @xmath193 ( units @xmath149 ) ; ( b ) density plot of the linear conductance @xmath187 ( units @xmath194 ) as a function of @xmath190 ( units @xmath149 ) and @xmath195 ; ( c ) maximum of the linear conductance as a function of @xmath190 ( units @xmath149 ) . in panels ( </S>",
    "<S> a ) and ( c ) , blue ( red ) curves have been calculated neglecting ( including ) electron - vibron coupling . </S>",
    "<S> other parameters : @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 appropriate for a semiconducting cnt and @xmath200.,width=264 ]    figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the calculated linear conductance and chemical potential shift for a cnt tuned about the transition between @xmath201 electrons ( @xmath202 , @xmath203 ) and @xmath204 electrons ( @xmath202 , @xmath205 ) for the case of mild interactions , @xmath206 . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( a ) shows the oscillations of the chemical potential shift @xmath207 as a function of the tip position @xmath190 . in the weak interaction regime , </S>",
    "<S> friedel oscillations dominate over the wigner ones : as a result a typical shape with @xmath208 maxima and @xmath209 minima is shown . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the wavelength of the friedel oscillations which is not determined by the total number of electrons but by the number of electrons in the sector @xmath210 involved in transport , in analogy with the behaviour of a two - channel quantum wire  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the blue curve represents the results in the absence of electron - vibron coupling : only minor ripples near the dot edges signal the weak influence of the wigner molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the red curve shows the results obtained including the electron - vibron coupling : a suppression of the oscillations is evident , which also washes away the small features near the border . </S>",
    "<S> the overall shape of @xmath207 is , however , completely analogous to the static case . here and in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen a semiconducting cnt with a fairly small fermi velocity @xmath199 , in order to enhance the electron - vibron coupling . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( b ) shows the linear conductance as a color map , as a function of the tip position and the number of charges induced by the gate . </S>",
    "<S> the latter quantity is responsible for tuning @xmath211 and hence for bringing the dot into the resonance , which occurs when @xmath212 , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cond ] ) . since @xmath191 oscillates , the value of @xmath213 needed to obtain the resonance fluctuates , allowing to map the shift in chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> also the intensity of the conductance oscillates as the tip is scanned along the cnt . </S>",
    "<S> panel ( c ) shows the height of the maximum @xmath214 as a function of @xmath190 . </S>",
    "<S> the overall qualitative features are analogous to those of the chemical potential with the presence of 5 peaks and 4 valleys . </S>",
    "<S> the static cnt displays small ripples at the border of the dot , similarly to the behaviour of the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> however , such features basically disappear as a vibrating dot is considered , along with a suppression of the conductance .     </S>",
    "<S> but for a strongly interacting cnt , with @xmath215.,width=264 ]    figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the case of a strongly interacting cnt , most favorable to observe the emergence of wigner correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential shift now distinctly shows 17 maxima and 16 minima , with an oscillation characterized by the wigner wavelength . in the case of a vibrating cnt , a suppression of the oscillations is observed . </S>",
    "<S> still , the qualitative shape of the chemical potential shift is unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as @xmath216 , the parameter @xmath84 increases , which leads to @xmath217 , thus making the contribution due to vibrons small . also in this case the oscillations of the intensity of the conductance show oscillations with a period shorter than the friedel one , however , the regime of a wigner molecule is not fully developed in this quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the small suppression of the differential conductance maximum in the case of a vibrating dot does not alter qualitatively the results . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion we have calculated the correction to the chemical potential and the linear conductance of a 1d quantum dot built in an interacting and suspended cnt , perturbed by a charged afm tip capacitively coupled to the dot . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that both quantities depend on the electron - vibron coupling , whose effect is to suppress the oscillations of the chemical potential and of the conductance , induced by the wigner and friedel oscillations of the density . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that for realistic devices with a fairly strong electron - vibron coupling this suppression is not enough to produce qualitative modifications of the oscillating patterns . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in the case of strongly interacting nanotubes , the large mismatch of velocities between the plasma modes and the strain implies a strong reduction of the effects induced by vibrons , producing an even more favorable situation to observe the effects of wigner molecules in a transport experiment . </S>",
