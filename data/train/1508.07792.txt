    "the reduction of critical materials present in consumer and industrial products in general , and in rare earth ( re ) -based permanent magnets in particular , is a pressing concern due to increasing demand and a decline and/or uncertainty in the supply chain of these materials .",
    "dysprosium , judged to be the most critical of these elements @xcite , is substituted onto the nd site in @xmath6  ( 2 - 14 - 1 ) permanent magnets to increase the value of their coercive field and maximum operating temperatures @xcite .",
    "depending on the application , the amount of dy added can be large , in the range of 1.4 - 8.7 wt% @xcite . the highest temperature applications , those that rely on the greatest quantities of dysprosium , are required by the rapidly emerging technologies of wind turbines , magnetically levitated transport , and traction motors for hybrid and electric cars @xcite .",
    "though dy is indeed considered the most critical element , by many criteria nd is not that far behind on the list @xcite .",
    "it is therefore imperative that new and innovative solutions are applied to the synthesis of permanent magnets that contain more abundant elements . to this end , recent work by pathak @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite has shown that partial substitution of ce for nd and co for fe ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) results in a permanent magnet with properties superior to those of dy - substituted 2 - 14 - 1 magnets for temperatures above 450 k. since 1 ) ce is by far the most abundant of the rare earth elements and 2 ) these new magnets simultaneously eliminate the need for dy and reduce the amount of nd used , they represent an exciting opportunity for the development of lower - cost high performance permanent magnets .",
    "the crystal structure of @xmath6  was established as tetragonal ( space group @xmath12 , no .",

    "however , detailed , quantitative experimental studies on the effects of ce substitution of varying amounts in pure single crystal samples have not previously been performed .",
    "abache and osterreicher @xcite studied aligned powders to determine the crystal structure , magnetic anisotropy , and spin reorientation temperature in @xmath0  for @xmath13 and @xmath14 along with a multitude of other compositional variations of @xmath6  achieved by varying the degree and type of substitutions on the re and transition metal ( tm ) sites .",

    "similar anomalies were evident in plots of coercivity ( @xmath19 ) , maximum energy product ( @xmath20 ) , and remnant magnetization ( @xmath21 ) as functions of ce concentration , along with the aforementioned phase segregation .",
    "the same investigation yielded an extraordinary result : when co is substituted for fe by two atoms per formula unit in @xmath22  where @xmath23 , the curie temperature ( @xmath24 ) increased by 150 k while coercivity dropped only 22% as compared to an equivalent sample with no co doping , @xmath25 @xmath26 . the anisotropy field ( @xmath27 ) , saturation moment ( @xmath28 ) , and @xmath21  remained more or less unchanged compared to the @xmath29 case .",
    "the possible applications of such excellent dy - free magnets spawns an exciting line of research focused on linking the microscopic magnetic properties in pure crystalline samples with the macroscopic magnetic properties of bulk permanent magnets .    in the current work , we have employed single crystal growth techniques to synthesize single crystals of ce - doped 2 - 14 - 1 compounds .",

    "the magnetic signals were found at both 4 k and 300 k with a propagation vector of @xmath58 , i.e. , they coincide with the nuclear peaks .",
    "therefore , in the data refinements , the nuclear and magnetic structure parameters were refined together .",
    "the results are presented in tables [ table4 ] and [ table5 ] .",
    "given the fact that the easy axis of this material is along the direction , the magnetic vectors at 300 k were constrained as such to reduce the total number of refined parameters . at 300",
    "k the total refined magnetic moment is @xmath59 @xmath7/f.u . , in reasonable accord with the mpms - determined value of 32.3 @xmath7/f.u .",
    "the fe sites have moments ranging from 1.3(1)@xmath423.2(2 ) @xmath7 .",
    "this variability is likely caused by the different steric environments experienced by each of the different fe sites . with the singular exception of the @xmath60 fe site the size of the moments",
    "are correlated to the degree of fe coordination around the fe atoms .",
    "for example , two of the largest moments are seen on the @xmath61 and @xmath62 sites which have fe coordinations of 12 and 10 , respectively .",
    "the smallest moment is observed at the fe @xmath63 site where the highest re coordination is present , with 4 of the 12 nearest neighbors being nd / ce .",
    "the two re sites have moments of 2.372 and 1.605 @xmath7  for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath3 site is , in terms of size , the larger of the two and is therefore predicted to be preferred for ce , assuming the ce is in the + 3 oxidation state @xcite .",
    "the ce@xmath64 ion ( 115 pm diameter ) is larger than the ce@xmath65 ion ( 101 pm ) and is therefore likely to prefer this larger site .",
    "when requiring that the thermal displacement parameters for the two different rare earth sites be equal , our 300k refinements presented in table [ table4 ] show that this preference is not absolute in that ce site preference for the @xmath3 site is 70% . if , however , we let the atomic displacement parameters for each of the re sites refine independently , the preference of ce for the @xmath3 site becomes even more absolute at 86% .",
    "though the degree of ce preference for the @xmath3 site and the atomic displacement parameters are highly correlated in these refinements , the fact that ce does prefer the @xmath3 site does not change .",
    "these observations concur with the preliminary xps data taken at the advanced light source ( als ) at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory whereby the xps spectrum for the ce @xmath66 electrons most closely resembles that of @xmath67 , indicating that the majority of ce is in the + 3 oxidation state for this composition .",
    "further experimentation is necessary to confirm this initial experimental result .",
    "for the 4 k refinement , we fixed the ce occupancy to the values found at 300 k ( 70% on the re @xmath3 site and 30% on the re @xmath4 site ) and let the magnetic vectors vary in direction , as below @xmath34140 k the easy axis is no longer the direction . at 4 k , the total magnetic moment for the sample is refined to be @xmath68 @xmath7 in reasonable agreement with the experimentally determined value of 34.9 @xmath7/f.u . for this composition ( below ) .",
    "the fe sites have moments that refine in the range @xmath69 .",
    "again , the moments associated with the fe sites largely scale with their degrees of coordination by other fe atoms .",
    "the refinement also shows that at 4 k the moments are tilted by @xmath3439.0@xmath70 , consistent with the well - known phenomena of spin reorientation in the 2 - 14 - 1 compounds at @xmath34140 k @xcite whereby the magnetic moments orient themselves along the direction rather than the direction seen at room temperatures @xcite .",
    "the angle between these two directions is 49.6@xmath70 , varying slightly from the experimentally determined value of 39.0@xmath70  from our refinement .",
    "however , to date no work has been done to quantify the effect of ce substitution on this reorientation with respect to changes in the easy direction of magnetization .      using single crystal neutron diffraction ,",
    "the ( 0 0 6 ) reflection of @xmath0  was measured upon warming ( fig.[figure4 ] ) . referring to fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , we see at 130.5 k a noticeable increase in the ( 0 0 6 ) peak intensity is evident , representing the spin reorientation transition whereby the magnetization easy axis shifts from the direction at high temperatures to something near the direction at low temperatures .",
    "previous investigations of undoped @xmath6   by abache and oesterreicher @xcite attributed this re - orientation to competing anisotropies of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 re sites . in their argument , the @xmath4 site ( the smaller of the two ) is more susceptible to planar moment alignment . at temperatures above the spin re - orientation temperature ( @xmath71 ) the axial anisotropies of the re and tm sites force the @xmath4 site to align axially in a ferromagnetic structure",
    "however , below 140 k the preference of the @xmath4 site to align its moment in a planar orientation is much stronger compared to the competing influences of the fe sites , resulting in spin re - orientation and a new easy axis for the system about 49@xmath70  canted away from the @xmath17 axis @xcite .",
    "the spin re - orientation is therefore dependent on the @xmath4 site .",
    "the related compound @xmath72 exhibits no spin re - orientation @xcite implying that ce has no inclination for planar orientation of its moment . substituting ce on the @xmath4 site",

    "to understand the effect of ce doping at the nd sites on the properties of @xmath6 , we replaced 10% of the nd atoms by ce using the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) .",
    "the total and partial dos for the doped system are presented as red curves in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "as we can see , the only significant change in the dos is at the re-@xmath83 states , which are shifted to lower energies by @xmath340.5 ev .",
    "thus , we see that the electronic properties of the nd - fe - b magnets are not significantly affected by ce doping , except a small reduction in the magnetic moments at the nd / ce site since ce has two fewer electrons in its valence shells ( @xmath84 ) than nd ( @xmath85 ) . thus , the number of electrons in the 68 atom ( 8 rare earth atoms ) unit cell is reduced by 1.6 electrons by 10% ce substitution which lead to a subsequent reduction in the average magnetic moment at these sites to 3.2 @xmath7  from 3.4 @xmath7 .",
    "we find from these spin - polarized calculations that the fe moments are mostly unaffected by the substitution .    an important consequence of the reduced exchange splitting is a reduction in curie temperature , @xmath24 .",
    "generally , for a ferromagnetic system characterized by large local moments such as the 2 - 14 - 1 materials , the curie temperature is controlled by the difference in energy between the ferromagnetic ground state and an essentially antiferromagnetic structure constructed so that most of the neighbors of fe atoms are antiparallel .",
    "this in turn is a function of the exchange parameters @xmath86 connecting nearest neighbors @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in the simplest mean - field approximation one may estimate the curie temperature as a third of this energy difference , measured on a per fe basis .",
    "we calculated the energy difference between the above - described ferromagnetic structure and an approximate antiferromagnetic structure obtained by flipping most of the nearest neighbor moments .",
    "the calculated energy difference is plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] as a function of the ce concentration@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath89 value of -2.71 ev per formula unit corresponds in the mean - field approximation to a @xmath24  of 748 k , which is to be compared to the experimental value of 585 k. the smaller experimental value suggests that effects beyond our simple mean - field approach may be relevant .",
    "a similar calculation overestimate was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite . upon substituting ce atoms via vca ,",
    "the magnitude of the energy difference decreases by about 4 percent for a 10 percent ce substitution .",
    "this suggests that the mean field @xmath90 decreases in @xmath6  as @xmath2 is increased which would in turn decrease the curie temperature .",
    "this is consistent with our experimental results , which also find a decrease in curie temperature with ce alloying .    as function of doping parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the energy difference reduces upon ce doping , suggesting that the exchange interaction @xmath90 and consequently @xmath24  will reduce as a function of ce concentration . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , we calculated the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) of @xmath0  for ce concentrations @xmath91 and @xmath92 to understand the effect of doping on this important parameter .",
    "we used the experimental structure at room temperature ( i.e. , in the ferromagnetic state ) to perform these calculations @xcite .",
    "the total energy is then calculated in the presence of spin orbit coupling with the moments pointing along @xmath43 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "the mae is defined as @xmath93 .",
    "we find that for @xmath94 , @xmath95  =  12.3 mev / f.u .",
    "( @xmath348 mj / m@xmath52 ) .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the experimental value of 4.3 mj / m@xmath52 , but we note that temperature effects are known to be significant in this compound @xcite .",
    "we find that the anisotropy energy remains more or less same upon doping ; we get @xmath95  =  13.2 mev / f.u .",
    "when @xmath92 .",
    "we do not consider the increase to be significant , but expect that larger levels of ce alloying would tend to show a reduction in the value of the mae .",
    "in short , we find that that the high magnetic anisotropy energy of the nd - fe - b system is not significantly affected by the ce doping , which confirms experimental observations .",
    "large single crystals of @xmath6  were grown from nd - fe flux .",
    "these crystals were a maximum of @xmath340.5 g in mass and displayed sharp faceting .",
    "cerium substitution was attempted for nd ; the maximum degree of substitution we were able to achieve was the composition @xmath76 .",
    "we found that ce and nd formed a continuous solid solution in contrast to the melt - spun ribbons of similar compositions fabricated by pathak @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite where a two phase region was observed for @xmath96 in @xmath0 .",
    "single crystal neutron diffraction showed that the ce has a slight preference for the larger re @xmath3 site , favoring this location by a factor of @xmath347:3 over the re @xmath4 site .",
    "the presence of ce serves to deleteriously affect magnetic properties such as @xmath24 , @xmath28 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the values of these characteristics largely fall in line with empirical predictions based on the application of simple alloying rules between the two parent compounds ( @xmath6  and @xmath72 ) .",
    "we have also used x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron emissions to determine the oxidation states and binding energies of all species in ce - substituted @xmath6 ; preliminary data shows that the xps spectrum for the ce 3@xmath79 electrons most closely resembles that of @xmath67 .    with the help of first - principles calculations",
    ", we studied the electronic and magnetic properties of ce doped nd - fe - b magnets .",
    "we find that for up to @xmath97 doping of ce , the electronic structure around the fermi level is not significantly affected .",
    "the exchange splitting and the magnetic moments at the nd sites are diminished as a consequence of ce doping , which in turn reduces the curie temperature .",
    "finally , we find that the high magnetic anisotropy energy of the nd - fe - b system is not significantly altered by the ce doping , confirming the experimental observations .",
