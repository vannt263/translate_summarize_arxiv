    "the red giant star populations play an important rle in the spectral evolution of a simple stellar population ( ssp ) , dominating the bolometric luminosity of a ssp after a few hundred million years .",
    "two special events ( the so - called phase transitions , hereafter ph - t ) due to the sudden appearance of stars with c - o and he degenerate cores mark the spectral evolution of a ssp .",
    "the first event corresponds to the appearance of bright asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ; the second correspond to the full development of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "several theoretical models @xcite investigated the impact of the agb and rgb stars on the total light of a ssp .",
    "the agb ph - t is predicted to occur after @xmath7 years and the rgb ph - t after @xmath8 years .",
    "these events must be empirically calibrated by using suitable templates of ssps , in order to use them for predicting the age of more complex stellar systems like galaxies .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) globular cluster system represents a gold - mine to study the agb and rgb properties with varying the age and chemical composition of the stellar population .",
    "indeed , these clusters cover a wide range in age @xcite , in metallicity @xcite and in integrated colors @xcite , providing the ideal template to investigate the spectral behavior of a ssp .",
    "the agb and rgb phases are intrinsically difficult to sample with the necessary statistical significance , because of their relatively short lifetimes .",
    "several searches investigated the ratio between c and m stars and its correlation with metallicity in the lmc field @xcite , finding more c stars in lower metallicity environments .",

    "fmb90 assumed that the separation between agb and rgb is positioned at @xmath9=-3.6 and stars brighter than that value are on the agb .",
    "they found c - stars only in the intermediate age swb iv - vi clusters .",
    "the swb vii clusters are too old , and their agb stars have too low mass stellar progenitors for evolving as c - stars , while swb i - iii clusters are still too young to have stars evolving along the agb . in these objects",
    "the brightest red stars are m supergiants . for intermediate age swb v - vi clusters 40% of the bolometric luminosity",

    "a quantitative estimate of the population ratios ( by number and luminosity ) between red giant branch and he - clump stars for each target cluster , and comparison with theoretical predictions suggest that the full development of the rgb should occur at @xmath12 and be a relatively fast event ( @xmath13 ) .",

    "the final cluster and control field frames have been sky  subtracted and flat - field corrected . for each cluster ,",
    "the dataset includes three j , h , ks images , centered on the cluster and three corresponding frames of an adjacent field .",
    "the photometric analysis was performed by using _",

    "the output catalogs of f04 ( calibrated on the @xcite photometric system ) have been also transformed into the 2mass one , although the difference between the two calibration turns out to be negligible ( @xmath26 mag ) .",
    "the calibrated photometric catalogs in each filter were finally matched and merged together in a global catalog , using the cataxcorr and catacomb softwares developed at the bologna observatory for an optimized cross - correlation .",
    "figs . 1 - 4 show the cmds for the observed clusters and adjacent fields in the @xmath27 plane .",
    "we have divided the clusters into two groups , accordingly to their s - parameter and different cmd morphology .",

    "[ cmdf1 ] and [ cmdf2 ] show the cmds of the corresponding adjacent fields .",
    "the cmds of the first group of clusters ( with @xmath28 ) appear quite complex , hence particular care has been devoted to separate the cluster population from the lmc field . in order to help the reader identify the two populations we have plotted in the last panel a sketch showing the mean location of cluster ( grey regions ) and field ( dashed region ) population in the cmd .",
    "the main properties of the cmds shown in fig .",
    "[ cmdc1 ] can be summarized as follows :    _ ( i )  _ magnitudes as faint as k@xmath29 have been measured .    _",
    "( ii )  _ the brightest objects at @xmath30 are likely agb stars .    _",
    "( iii )  _ a blue sequence is clearly visible at -0.3@xmath31 and k@xmath3215.5 , corresponding to the brightest end of the cluster ms .    _",

    "( v )  _ the direct comparison of each panel in figs .",
    "[ cmdc1 ] and [ cmdf1 ] clearly shows the significant contribution of the lmc field stars .",
    "as schematically shown in the last panel of fig.[cmdc1 ] , most of the stars in the region @xmath37 and @xmath38 are indeed lmc field stars , with a well defined rgb at @xmath39 and the he - clump at k@xmath1917 .",
    "the observed cmds for the second group of cluster show the following characteristics :    _ ( i )  _ magnitude limits down to k@xmath29 , i.e. about 1.5  mag below the he - clump , which is clearly visible as a clump of stars at @xmath40 .    _",
    "( ii )  _ a well - populated and extended rgb .    _ ( iii )  _ the brightest objects at @xmath41 are likely agb stars .    _",
    "( iv )  _ unlike the first group of clusters , in these objects cluster and field populations do overlap .",
    "correction for extinction is computed accordingly to the @xmath42 values reported in table  [ tabpar ] and the @xcite interstellar extinction law .",
    "the infrared dust maps by @xcite in the direction of the observed clusters provide very similar ( on average within @xmath430.03  dex ) @xmath23 corrections , with the exception of ngc 2031 , for which the discrepancy is about 0.1  dex . however , the overall impact of such a discrepancy on the infrared magnitudes is always small ( well within 0.1  dex ) , hence reddening correction is not a critical issue in this context .",
    "absolute and bolometric magnitudes have been obtained by adopting a distance modulus @xmath44 @xcite and suitable bolometric corrections by using the @xmath45 color and the empirical calibrations by @xcite . in computing luminosities , we adopted @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the sun . in the following all the derived luminosities",
    "are expressed in unit of @xmath48 .",
    "a suitable calibration of the lmc cluster age is still a major concern since homogeneous determinations based on the ms to , for a significant number of clusters , are not available yet .",
    "following f04 , here we use the @xmath20parameter ( see sect.[obs ] ) .",
    "being a pure empirical quantity , it needs to be calibrated with age . as discussed in f04 ,",
    "the most used calibrations by @xcite based on canonical models and by @xcite based on overshooting models provide , somewhat surprisingly , very similar ages ( within 10 - 15 % ) .",
    "although a new calibration of the _ s_-parameter as a function of age ( see f04 ) is urged , in the following , as done in f04 , we adopted the most recent one by @xcite and based on the models with overshooting by bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) : @xmath49 we assume a conservative error of @xmath50=@xmath431 , which translates into a @xmath19 20% age uncertainty .",
    "table  [ tabpar ] lists the @xmath51 value for the entire sample of 19 clusters ( 13 presented here and 6 discussed in f04 , respectively ) and their age derived from the quoted calibration .",
    "as can be seen the entire sample cover a large range of ages from @xmath52 to @xmath2 .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the agb and rgb populations ( by number and luminosity ) is crucial to empirically calibrate the relative lifetimes and to quantitatively evaluate the impact of each evolutionary stage on the total luminosity of a ssp . in order to obtain reliable stellar counts and luminosities in each branch , we proceeded as follows : _ ( 1 ) _ stars in each evolutionary stage have been identified on the basis of suitable selection boxes as defined in the cmds ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ cumagb ] and fig .  [ boxrgb ] )",
    "; _ ( 2 ) _ each sample of stars has been corrected for incompleteness , following the standard _ artificial star _ technique ( see below ) ; _ ( 3 ) _ the contamination from foreground / background stars in each population has been evaluated and statistically subtracted to the observed samples .    while the definition of the selection boxes ( _ step ( 1 ) _ ) for the agb and rgb populations are described in sects .",
    "[ agbpht ] and [ rgbpht ] , respectively , in the following we briefly discuss the procedure adopted to perform _ step ( 2 ) _ and _ step ( 3)_.      the degree of completeness can be quantified by using the widely - used artificial star technique ( see the discussion present in * ? ? ?",
    "for each cluster we have derived the rgb fiducial line and then a population of artificial stars , having magnitudes , colors , and luminosity functions resembling the observed distributions was generated and added to the original images . since crowding effects are more severe in the central regions , the frame area sampling the cluster has been divided in three concentric regions ( _ region a , b and c _ , see left panel of fig .",
    "[ map ] ) and the completeness has been estimated independently in each of them .",
    "the maximum spatial extension of each cluster has been estimated from the cluster radial density profile .",
    "a total of @xmath19200,000 artificial stars have been simulated in each cluster in about 1000 simulation runs . indeed , in order to not alter the crowding conditions , only 100200 stars have been simulated in each run .",
    "the fraction of recovered objects in each magnitude interval was estimated as @xmath53 , and a suitable completeness curve was obtained in each of the a , b , c regions ( see right panels of fig .  [ map ] ) .",
    "star counts in each radial region have been finally corrected for incompleteness , by dividing each observed distribution by the corresponding @xmath54 factors ) in each bin of magnitude is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of stars observed in that bin . ] .",
    "the total number of stars has been finally obtained by summing the completeness - corrected number of stars of the a , b , c regions .",
    "as already discussed in previous papers , the artificial star technique provides only a first - order correction .",
    "in fact , the observed distribution is , in principle , distorted because of two main phenomena : the loss of faint stars due to incompleteness and an excess of bright stars due to possible blending effects of two or more faint stars into a brighter one . only the first effect is taken into account by the artificial star simulation .",
    "blending from faint ms stars is a more complicated effect to simulate , however in the near ir it is negligible ( see also discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "another important effect which needs to be investigated , is the degree of contamination of the selected samples by the foreground / background stars . in this paper",
    "we have applied a statistical decontamination technique , using a control field adjacent to the clusters . the total number of stars observed in each evolutionary sequence ( agb , rgb and he - clump ) has been counted accordingly to the _ selection boxes _ both in the cluster ( see figs .  [ cmdc1 ] and  [ cmdc2 ] ) and field ( see figs .  [ cmdf1 ] and [ cmdf2 ] ) cmds , and corrected for incompleteness ( see above ) .",
    "the star counts in the field population have been scaled to take into account the different surveyed area , and their contribution have been subtracted from the cluster population .    in summary",
    ", for each radial region , each selection box corresponding to each evolutionary stage has been divided in bins of magnitude ( typically 0.2 mag wide ) .",
    "then , the `` corrected '' number of stars in each bin has been computed as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath56 is the number of stars observed in that bin , @xmath58 is the number of stars lost for incompleteness , @xmath59 is the expected number of field stars .",
    "analogously , the total luminosity of each evolutionary stage can be computed accordingly to the following relation : @xmath60 where the term @xmath61 is the total luminosity of the stars observed in a given bin , @xmath58 is the number of stars lost for incompleteness , @xmath59 is the expected number of field stars , and @xmath62 is the equivalent luminosity of that bin , that is the luminosity of a star with magnitude equal to the mean value of the bin .    finally , star counts and total luminosity of each evolutionary stage have been obtained by summing the contribution of all the bins in each selection box .      in order to properly perform cluster to cluster comparisons , one needs to take into account the size of the total cluster population . hence both star counts and luminosities needs to be normalized to a reference population or to the cluster integrated luminosity . in previous papers we followed both the approaches ( in f95 and",
    "f04 the rgb populations were normalized to the cluster integrated luminosity taken from the literature , and to the he - clump population , respectively ) .",
    "the large fov of sofi offer the opportunity to independently determine the near - infrared integrated magnitudes for the program clusters . in doing this",
    ", we adopted a simple approach , by performing aperture photometry over the entire cluster extension ( typically @xmath63 ) . in order to correct for the field contamination",
    ", an equivalent aperture photometry has been also performed on each control field and the resulting luminosity has been subtracted from the cluster value .",
    "the cluster center has been computed by applying a standard technique  ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* )  which uses the knowledge of the position of individual stars in the innermost region of the cluster , allowing a high precision determination of the center of gravity .",
    "hence , by applying the procedure described in @xcite we computed @xmath64 by simply averaging the @xmath65 and @xmath66 coordinates of stars lying within a fixed radius from a first - guess center estimated by eye .",
    "the barycenter of the stars is then derived iteratively ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the center of gravity ( @xmath64 ) of the programme clusters are listed in table  [ tabpar ] .",
    "our new estimates turn out to be reasonably consistent ( within @xmath67 ) with available determinations ( as those in the simbad astronomical database by the cds , strasbourg ) .",
    "the typical @xmath68 uncertainty of our estimates is @xmath69 pixels corresponding to @xmath70 in both @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the position of the center of 2 clusters , namely ngc2136 and ngc2173 , appear to be significantly ( up to 2 arcmin ) different from the simbad coordinates .",
    "the case of ngc  2136 deserves an additional comment .",
    "indeed , a small _ twin _ cluster , namely ngc  2137 , is present at an angular distance of @xmath73 @xcite . since its integrated luminosity , although significantly fainter , is contaminating the aperture photometry of ngc  2136 , it has been properly subtracted .",
    "integrated k magnitude , colors and derived bolometric luminosities in the k band and in bolometric for the entire sample of 19 clusters are listed in table  [ tabmag ] .",
    "formal errors are directly estimated from the photometric samples , by assuming that star counts follow the poisson statistics .",
    "the errorbars for the various population ratios ( by number and/or by luminosity ) have been computed accordingly to the following formula @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 being the numerator and @xmath77 the denominator of the ratio .    in the computation of the population ratios different error sources are at work , depending on the observable .    *",
    "total cluster luminosity : the main source of uncertainty in this case is the positioning of the cluster center .",
    "we estimate that an off - centering of 5 pixels corresponds to a 5% variation in luminosity .",
    "an additional uncertainty of @xmath78 has been considered in the computation of bolometric luminosities , in order to take into account the uncertainty in the bolometric corrections .",
    "* agb luminosity : a conservative uncertainty of 0.2  mag in setting the faint end of the agb luminosity distribution , implies a @xmath195% variation in the total agb luminosity .",
    "however , for this observable the major source of uncertainty is the random error associated to the number of detected agb stars ( in the poisson regime @xmath79 ) , which can suffer large fluctuations due to the small number statistics . on average ,",
    "the overall @xmath80 associated to the @xmath81 ratio turns out to be 30% . *",
    "number and luminosity of c - stars : as in the case of agb stars , these observables and their associated errors suffer large fluctuations due to the small number statistics . on average ,",
    "the overall @xmath80 associated to the @xmath82 ratio turns out to be @xmath1950% . * rgb luminosity : in the older clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ cmdc2 ] ) the rgb is well populated , hence the estimated luminosity is much less affected by statistical fluctuations or by the selection box definition . on average , we estimate a @xmath8320% for the rgb population ratios .",
    "theoretical models @xcite predict that the most important contributors to the integrated cluster light between @xmath84 and @xmath85 yrs are agb stars .",
    "the agb population includes both o - rich ( m - type ) and c - rich stars . during the thermal pulsing phase ( hereafter tp - agb ) an agb becomes c - rich",
    "if it undergoes the third dredge - up mixing process ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of c - stars in stellar clusters depends on their age and metallicity @xcite .    in intermediate age clusters",
    "the bulk of the agb population is more luminous than the rgb tip , and a minor overlap does exist between the faintest end of the agb and the brightest portion of the rgb .",
    "here we use our data set in order to investigate the contribution to the cluster luminosity of the brightest portion of the agb populations as a function of the cluster age . in order to consider",

    "we used both the cumulative color - magnitude and color - color diagrams in fig.[cumagb ] to make a census ( both by number and luminosity ) of the agb stars brighter than the rgb tip as well as of c - stars in each cluster .",

    "old canonical models of stellar evolution @xcite were dating the occurrence of the agb ph - t by @xcite at significantly earlier epochs ( @xmath95 ) of the stellar lifetime with respect to the new models .",

    "we have adopted the same procedure described in f04 . using the cumulative @xmath103 , @xmath104 cmd for the 12 clusters we identified the mean loci of the upper rgb and the he - clump and defined the corresponding selection boxes sampling these populations ( see f04 ) . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ agbpht ] the rgb tip is expected to be at @xmath10512.3 . as an example , fig .",
    "[ boxrgb ] shows the de - reddened cmd of ngc  1651 where the two selection boxes for the rgb and he - clump population , respectively , have been plotted .",
    "since the photometric errors can significantly broaden the faint sequences , the size of the boxes including the base of the rgb and the he - clump has been conservatively assumed to be @xmath19 5 times the photometric error at that level of magnitude .",
    "population counts and luminosities for stars in the rgb and he - clump evolutionary stage have been obtained and corrected for incompleteness and field contamination accordingly with the procedure discussed in sect .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tabrgb ] and plotted in figs .",
    "[ contrgb ] and [ lumrgb ] .",
    "[ contrgb ] shows the behavior of the number of rgb stars normalized to the number of he - clump stars as a function of the cluster age .",
    "[ lumrgb ] shows the bolometric luminosities of rgb stars normalized to the bolometric luminosities of he - clump stars as a function of the cluster age ( upper panel ) and the bolometric luminosities of rgb stars normalized to the bolometric luminosities of entire cluster as a function of age ( lower panel ) .",
    "note that , in a few high density clusters ( see table  [ tabrgb ] ) with severe crowding , completeness drops down to 60% at the he - clump magnitude level in the innermost a region ( see fig.[map ] ) .",
    "hence , in these clusters star counts and luminosities have been computed only in the outer b and c regions .    as already discussed in f04 , at an age of @xmath106 the rapid increase of the rgb population ratios ( by a factor of @xmath193 in number and @xmath194 in luminosity ) in a timescale as short as @xmath107 flags the occurring of the rgb ph - t . at the age of @xmath5",
    "a progressive flattening of the ratios suggests that the full developing of an extended and well populated rgb has occurred .",
    "the overall increase of the population ratios between @xmath106 and @xmath108 is a factor @xmath195 by number and @xmath197 by luminosity . + empirical data",
    "have been compared to theoretical predictions . in fig .",
    "[ contrgb ] and fig .",
    "[ lumrgb ] , we over - plotted the predictions of canonical models @xcite with @xmath109=-0.33 $ ] .",
    "the models nicely agree with the observations over the entire range of considered ages , well describing the epoch , the duration and the increasing contribution of the rgb phase .",
    "it is worth noticing the population ratio excess ( both by number and by luminosity , see figs .",
    "[ contrgb ] and [ lumrgb ] ) of ngc  1783 , when compared with other clusters with similar values of the @xmath20parameter ( i.e. , ngc  2231 ) .",
    "it is likely that this cluster be older than suggested by the @xmath20parameter , since its cmd ( see fig .",
    "[ cmdc2 ] ) shows a fully populated rgb , typical of clusters with s - parameter@xmath1840 .",
    "indeed , its rgb morphology is more similar to that one of clusters such as ngc  1806 , ngc  2173 and ngc  1978 rather than that one of ngc  2231 ( see fig .  2 in f04 ) .",
    "this evidence further supports the urgency of a new homogeneous calibration of the age scale of lmc clusters .",
    "we have used our extensive near ir database of 19 lmc clusters spanning a wide range of ages ( from @xmath52 to @xmath2 ) in order to investigate the developing in time of the agb and rgb evolutionary stages .",
    "the behavior of the quantitative contribution to the total cluster luminosity of both the rgb and agb in terms of age has been investigated and turns out to be nicely in agreement with theoretical prediction of canonical models .",
    "the agb contribution to the total cluster luminosity starts to be significant at @xmath3 and reaches its maximum peak at @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ agbkbol ] ) , when the rgb ph - t is starting ( see f04 and figs .  [ contrgb ] and [ lumrgb ] ) .",
    "both events are sharp and last a few hundreds @xmath6 only .",
    "the epoch and duration of the agb phase - transition estimated from our data confirm the semi - empirical modelling of @xcite .",
    "the latter was based on the calibration of the agb - fuel consumption of canonical tracks , and its partition between c and o - type stars , with previous mc gcs data ( fmb90 , f95 ) . furthermore , the epoch and duration of the rgb phase transition derived from our data agree very well with the theoretical predictions of simple stellar population models based on canonical tracks and the fuel - consumption approach @xcite .",
