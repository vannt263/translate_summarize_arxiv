    "the filamentation instability or beam - weibel instability has been proposed as a mechanism to magnetize the early universe @xcite , to provide the strong magnetic fields for the afterglow emission of gamma - ray bursts @xcite and supernova explosions @xcite and to explain the heating processes in the pulsar winds @xcite .",
    "it is also important for the inertial confinement fusion in laser - plasmas @xcite .",
    "the filamentation instability has been investigated analytically @xcite , numerically @xcite and also in a laboratory experiment @xcite , where it has been discussed as the precursor to the formation of astrophysical shocks of gamma - ray bursts and supernovae .    however , the filamentation instability is not the only instability that can generate magnetic fields . here , we focus on a second one , the thermal anisotropy - driven weibel instability ( tawi ) , which we study with particle - in - cell simulations .",
    "there are several analytical and numerical works of the tawi , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the physical mechanism behind the tawi for a plasma , in which the temperature along one direction exceeds significantly those along the other two directions .",
    "the typical microcurrents of the electrons are highest along the direction with the high temperature .",
    "the magnetic interaction force that causes the deflection of electrons is thus strong orthogonal to this direction . at the same time , the typical particle s thermal energy orthogonal to the direction with the high temperature is relatively weak .",
    "the particle s thermal motion can , in this case , not oppose the structure formation .",
    "current channels form with an axis , which is aligned with the direction of the high plasma temperature .",
    "the original work of weibel @xcite considers a bi - maxwellian distribution with one component of lower temperature yielding a one dimensional wave growth with wave vectors @xmath0 in the direction of lower temperature .",
    "in contrast , we choose only one hot direction .",
    "the wave growth will then occur in the two dimensional plane perpendicular to that direction and give rise to the generation of a magnetic field in this plane .",
    "the temperature anisotropy we consider here can be the result of a buneman instability @xcite , which emerges for example at the terrestrial foreshock @xcite .",
    "the latter is a result of the backstreaming of solar wind particles , which do not pass the terrestrial bow shock and move back into the solar wind domain .",
    "the backstreaming particles form a foreshock upstream of the shock .",
    "a buneman instability develops between the shock - reflected ions and the electrons of the solar wind , if we assume for simplicity that no magnetic field is present .",
    "the phase velocity of the waves is comparable to the ion beam velocity @xcite , which we denote here as @xmath1 in the electron rest frame .",
    "the electric field amplitude grows and the electrons are trapped in phase space holes , when the kinetic energy of the electrons in the wave frame is not sufficient to escape the wave potential @xcite .",
    "they are accelerated along the beam velocity vector to a few times the beam speed . since the spectrum of the waves driven by the buneman instability is not strictly mono - directional",
    ", the electrons also experience a , usually weaker , acceleration away from the beam velocity vector .",
    "after the heating of the electrons , the buneman instability is quenched .",
    "the electrons are heated more in the ion beam direction than in the plane orthogonal to it and a temperature anisotropy has developed .",
    "the proximity of the terrestrial foreshock permits a direct access by in - situ observations .",
    "therefore the particle configurations are well - known and the ion beam velocity could be determined to some hundred km@xmath2s @xcite , which is comparable to the speed of the solar wind in the reference frame of the bow shock .",
    "we assume that this physical scenario can be applied to the foreshocks of supernova remnants ( snr ) , where the bulk flow speed of the supernova blast shell and thus of the snr shock has been determined to be less or equal to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the ion beam speed should be similar to the velocity of the shock in the upstream reference frame .",
    "realistic values for the interstellar medium , into which a snr shock is expanding , would be @xmath4 nt and @xmath5 @xcite , which would give a ratio of the plasma frequency to the electron cyclotron frequency of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we can neglect the magnetic fields .",
    "experimental evidence indicates that the magnetic field close to snr shocks is amplified to values @xmath7 nt , presumably by the shock - accelerated cosmic ray particles @xcite .",
    "recent pic simulations @xcite seem to suggest though , that the magnetic field can not be amplified by the cosmic rays to values much higher than the amplitude of the background magnetic field .",
    "the tawi we consider here is driven by the electron heating by the shock - reflected ion beam , which we find even at unmagnetized shocks @xcite .",
    "it can thus amplify a magnetic field from fluctuation levels and constitute the first stage of a chain of magnetic field amplification mechanisms upstream of a snr shock .",
    "our pic simulations evidence that the peak magnetic field , which results from the tawi , would be 8 nt for a plasma density of @xmath8 , well in excess of the ism magnetic field .",
    "these 8 nt constitute a minimum estimate , because the electron density , which scales this peak field , is higher in the foreshock than in the ism .",
    "we perform two simulations and compare them to @xcite : first we choose a 2d simulation plane that includes the direction of higher temperature , which we refer to as the parallel direction , and one perpendicular direction with a lower temperature . we show that the wave spectrum is one - dimensional during the early stage of the instability . in reality , this wave spectrum would be spread out over the plane that is orthogonal to the parallel direction .",
    "the dimensional reduction is , however , beneficial for the study of the interplay of the electromagnetic fields and the key plasma structures .",
    "we discuss the temporal behaviour of the electric and magnetic energy densities and analyse the field data , demonstrating that only that component of the magnetic field is amplified , which points out of the simulation plane .",
    "the magnetic pressure gradient generates initially an electric field in the perpendicular direction . a secondary instability transfers electric field energy from the perpendicular into the parallel direction .",
    "second we perform a 1d simulation along the perpendicular direction .",
    "we demonstrate that a weak electric field in the parallel direction is generated by ampere s law .",
    "the connection between the much stronger electric field in the perpendicular direction and the magnetic pressure gradient is demonstrated also in this setting .",

    "the @xmath99 field accelerates electrons away from the break , while the drift electric field imposed by the non - zero mean speed along @xmath110 and the @xmath125 is compressing the electrons along @xmath109 .",
    "this compression is stronger close to the breaks than the electric repulsion , which results in an electron accumulation .",

    "@xcite may thus not always be justified for the weibel instability .",
    "the high phase space resolution of pic simulations , which is now possible , has revealed that the size of the filaments in the 1d simulation increases not through the merger of filaments , which is inhibited by the 1d geometry , but through a broadening of the filaments due to the overlap of phase space layers .",
