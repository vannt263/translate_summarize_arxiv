    "the archetypical problem in information theory is finding the capacity of a noisy channel to transmit messages with high fidelity . already in @xcite ,",
    "shannon provided a simple formula for the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel , with single - letter capacity formulas of more general channels to follow later ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the status of the quantum channel capacity question is not nearly as nice .",
    "while there has recently been significant progress towards finding the quantum capacity of a quantum channel @xcite , the resulting expressions can not be evaluated in any tractable way , with the exception of some very special channels ( e.g. , the capacity of the amplitude - damping @xcite , dephasing @xcite and erasure @xcite channels are known , most others are not ) .",
    "in fact , there are several capacities that can be defined for a quantum channel , depending on what type of information is to be sent ( e.g. , quantum or classical ) and what sort of resources are allowed to accomplish transmission ( e.g. , free entanglement , two - way classical communication , etc . ) .",
    "so far only two of these capacities seem to admit single - letter formulas : the entanglement - assisted capacity @xcite and the environment - assisted quantum capacity @xcite .",
    "the multi - letter formulas available for the other capacities , including the quantum capacity , provide , at best , partial characterizations .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that the capacity for noiseless quantum communication of a quantum channel @xmath0 is given by @xmath1 in this expression , @xmath0 is a quantum channel mapping quantum states on the vector space @xmath2 to states on the space @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a pure quantum state on @xmath5 copies of @xmath2 together with a reference system @xmath6 .",
    "the state @xmath7 , is the state that results when the @xmath5 copies of @xmath2 are acted on by @xmath5 copies of the channel @xmath0 .",
    "finally , @xmath8 is known as the _ coherent information _",
    "@xcite , which is defined in terms of the von neumann entropy @xmath9 . in order to evaluate this regularized formula one would have to perform an optimization over an infinite number of variables , making a numerical approach essentially impossible .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the limit on the right is in general strictly larger than the corresponding single - letter expression @xcite : there are channels , @xmath0 , for which @xmath10    in the absence of an explicit formula for the quantum capacity , it is desirable to find upper and lower bounds for eq .",
    "( [ eq : quantumcapacity ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , most known bounds are as difficult to evaluate in general as eq .",
    "( [ eq : quantumcapacity ] ) .",
    "examples of upper bounds that _ can _ be easily evaluated , at least in some special cases , are given by the no - cloning based arguments of @xcite , the semi - definite programming bounds of rains @xcite and the closely related relative entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "none of these is expected to be particularly tight  the last two are also upper bounds for the capacity assisted by two - way classical communication ( which can be much larger than one - way ) , whereas the first is based solely on reasoning about where the channel s capacity must be zero .",
    "as such , it would be useful to find new upper bounds for the quantum capacity that are both free of regularization and fundamentally one - way . in the following we present just such a bound .",
    "inspired by the fact that allowing free forward classical communication does not increase the quantum channel capacity @xcite , we will consider the capacity of a quantum channel assisted by the use of a quantum channel that maps symmetrically to the receiver ( bob ) and the environment ( eve ) .",
    "such assistance channels , which we call _ symmetric side channels _ , can be used for forward classical communication but are apparently somewhat stronger .",
    "they can , however , immediately be seen to have zero quantum capacity , so that while the assisted capacity we find may in general be larger than the usual quantum capacity , one expects that it will provide a fairly tight upper bound . in particular , the _ symmetric side channel capacity _ ( ss - capacity ) we find will not be an upper bound for the capacity assisted by two - way classical communication .",
    "the expression we find for the assisted capacity , which we ll call @xmath11 , turns out to be much easier to deal with than eq .",
    "( [ eq : quantumcapacity ] ) and has several nice properties .",
    "most importantly , our expression is free of the regularization present in so many quantum capacity formulas .",
    "we will also see that @xmath11 is convex , additive , and that it is equal to @xmath12 for the family of degradable channels @xcite .",
    "we will use these properties to find upper bounds on @xmath11 of the depolarizing channel which , in turn , will give a significant improvement over known bounds for its unassisted capacity .",
    "it should be emphasized that we have not found an upper bound on the dimension of the side channel needed to attain the assisted capacity , which in general prevents us from evaluating @xmath11 explicitly or even numerically .",
    "while we can not rule out such a bound , the arguments we use to establish several of @xmath11 s nice properties rely explicitly on the availability of an unbounded dimension .",
    "this suggests that dealing with an assistance channel of unbounded dimension may be the price we pay for such desirable properties as additivity and convexity , which is reminiscent of the findings of @xcite .",
    "in this section , we collect the definitions of important concepts and quantities , as well as describing some of their properties",
    ".    we will mainly be concerned with finite - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the state of a @xmath13 dimensional system is described by a _ density operator _ ( or _ density matrix _ ) , which is a trace one linear operator on the complex vector space @xmath14 , typically denoted @xmath15 , where we have used the notation @xmath16 to denote the set of bounded linear operators on a space @xmath17 .",
    "such a @xmath18 is required to be hermitian , meaning that @xmath19 where the hermitian conjugate @xmath20 consists of transposition followed by complex conjugation , and positive semidefinite , meaning @xmath21 .",
    "any such @xmath18 has a spectral decomposition , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the projector onto an element @xmath24 , the @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 , and the @xmath27s are nonnegative and sum to one .",
    "a rank one density operator , @xmath28 , is called a pure state .",
    "we will often include the pure state and density operator s spaces as subscripts , for example @xmath29 denotes a density operator on @xmath6 and @xmath30 .",
    "a useful operation on the set of quantum states is the partial trace .",
    "we first define the usual trace of a density operator @xmath31 to be @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath33 is a density operator on the tensor product of @xmath6 and @xmath3 , @xmath34 , we define the partial trace over @xmath3 , denoted @xmath35 as the unique linear operation satisfying @xmath36 for all @xmath37 , and where we have let @xmath38 be the identity on @xmath3 .",
    "physically , the partial trace over @xmath3 may be thought of as discarding the @xmath3 system .",
    "the resulting state on @xmath6 is referred to as the reduced state on @xmath6 .",
    "given an state @xmath33 , we will often use subscripts to denote a reduced state , for example @xmath39 .",
    "we will often be concerned with quantum states on the tensor product of many copies of the same space , where we will use the notation @xmath40 , and occasionally @xmath41 .    given two states , @xmath18 and @xmath42 , a natural measure of their similarity is the fidelity , @xmath43 which is equal to @xmath44 if the states are identical and @xmath45 if they are orthogonal .",
    "another useful measure of their similarity is the trace distance , defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "these two measures are related @xcite according to @xmath48    the physical operations that can be applied a quantum state are _ completely positive trace preserving _ ( cptp ) linear maps from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the input and output spaces , respectively . a positive linear map , @xmath0 , satisfies the requirement @xmath53 for every @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , a linear map with input space @xmath51 and output space @xmath52 can be extended to a map from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes a tensor product of the spaces , by choosing the extended map to act as the identity on @xmath57 .",
    "if the extended map , which we will denote @xmath58 , is positive for any choice of @xmath57 , the map @xmath0 is called _",
    "completely positive_. together with the trace - preserving requirement , demanding complete positivity ensures that cptp maps are the most general class of linear operations mapping density operators to density operators .",
    "due to the stinespring dilation theorem @xcite , a cptp map ( or _ quantum channel _ ) @xmath0 , with input space @xmath6 and output space @xmath3 can always be represented as an isometric embedding of @xmath6 into @xmath59 for some environment space @xmath60 , followed by a partial trace over @xmath60 . in other words",
    ", there will be an isometry @xmath61 , satisfying @xmath62 , such that @xmath63 .",
    "sometimes the isometry corresponding to a channel @xmath0 will be called @xmath64 .",
    "this dilation , of which we shall make free use , is unique up to unitary equivalences of @xmath60 .",
    "there is another representation of a quantum channel is in terms of its kraus decomposition .",
    "any quantum channel with input space @xmath6 and output space @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 are linear maps from @xmath6 to @xmath3 with @xmath67 , and @xmath68 is the identity on @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath38 , which is an operator on the vector space @xmath3 , we denote the identity channel on @xmath69 as @xmath70 , which acts according to @xmath71 for all @xmath72 .",
    "a channel of particular interest is the depolarizing channel , which maps a two - dimensional space ( or , _ qubit _ ) to a two - dimensional space .",
    "this channel is the quantum analogue of the binary symmetric channel .",
    "for any qubit density operator , @xmath73 , the depolarizing channel with error probability @xmath74 acts as @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the pauli matrices ,    @xmath79    even the capacity of this relatively simple quantum channel is unknown . in section [ sec : application ] we will find upper bounds on this capacity .    the von neumann entropy of a density operator @xmath18 on a space @xmath6 is given by @xmath80 .",
    "we will often use the notation @xmath81 to denote the entropy of a state @xmath18 on a space @xmath6 and , when it is clear to which state we refer , we will also simply write @xmath82 . the _ coherent information of a given b _ of a bipartite state @xmath83 is defined as @xmath84 or equivalently , @xmath85 . as with the entropy , when there is no ambiguity as to which state is being discussed , we will simply write @xmath86 . the coherent information satisfies a quantum data - processing inequality with respect to processing on the @xmath3 system , meaning that for any state @xmath33 and channel , @xmath0 , mapping @xmath3 to @xmath87 , @xmath88 this data processing inequality is a simple consequence of the strong subadditivity of von neumann entropy @xcite , and was first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the failure of the analogous data processing inequality on the @xmath6 system @xcite is closely related to the need for a regularization in the formula for the quantum channel capacity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quantumcapacity ] ) .",
    "a useful property of the von neumann entropy is that is continuous  two states which are close in terms of trace distance have entropies which are correspondingly close . more specifically , fannes has shown @xcite that if @xmath18 and @xmath42 are states on a @xmath13-dimensional space with trace distance @xmath89 , then @xmath90 if we do not require @xmath89 , we have a slightly looser bound of @xmath91 in light of the relationship between fidelity and trace distance expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fuchs ] ) , we also have the relation @xmath92 which derives an operational meaning from its role in the single - letter formula for the entanglement assisted capacity @xcite .",

    "as it turns out , when one evaluates the coherent information that can be generated with @xmath110 uses of a channel , it will in some cases exceed @xmath110 times the maximum coherent information that can be generated with one copy .",

    "so far , we have not been able to find a channel for which the ss - capacity and capacity differ .",
    "we expect that such channels exist , and a better understanding of when the two capacities differ may point towards simplifications of the quantum capacity formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quantumcapacity ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we first discovered the unsymmetrized version of the quantity @xmath165 given in lemma  [ lemma : asymmetric ] , and that it is an upper bound for @xmath12 .",
    "this was motivated by the quest to find the entanglement analogue of the upper bound on distillable key presented in @xcite .",
    "it was only later that it became clear that the formula could be made symmetric and interpreted as the quantum capacity of a channel given the family of assistance channels we have considered .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the approach we have taken here is qualitatively similar to the work of @xcite in the two - way scenario . in that work",
    ", it was found that _ enlarging _ the set of operations allowed for entanglement distillation from locc to the easier - to - deal - with set of separable or positive - partial - transpose-(ppt-)preserving operations made it possible to establish tighter bounds on two - way distillable entanglement than was possible by considering locc protocols directly .",
    "similarly , we have shown that by augmenting a channel with a zero capacity side channel , a simplified capacity formula can be found that allows us to establish tighter bounds on the unassisted capacity than were possible by direct considerations . to",
    "what extent this approach can be used in general , the reason such an approach works at all , and the tightness of the bounds achieved in this way are all questions that we leave wide open .",
