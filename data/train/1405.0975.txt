    "@xmath6 attainable in numerical simulations we should thus typically expect the intercepts to be of sizes similar to the terms @xmath105 on the right - hand sides of eqs .  - , or even much larger , as occurs when @xmath106 ; this regime will be analyzed in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "we believe this observation is key to explaining the difficulties met in observing numerically the asymptotic scalings in eqs .  - .",
    "recognizing that short time averages tend to be dominated by diffusive motion helps explain the relevance of the fitting parameters @xmath99 .",
    "indeed the effect of ballistic trajectories on the statistics of displacements is feeble and the anomalous logarithmic divergences have a rather weak influence on the finite - time statistics , especially so when @xmath13 is close to its upper bound , @xmath107 ( so that the horizontal and vertical corridors have narrowing widths ) .      for a given value of the parameter @xmath13 ,",
    "a key issue is to determine a time interval where the fitting parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 in eqs .  - can be accurately measured .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , integration times should be neither too short , nor too long ; they should be large enough to avoid the regime where transient effects dominate , but can not be too large , since the number of initial conditions required to sample the moments up to a given time scale grows with the square of this scale ; see the discussion below .    at the level of the dynamics ,",
    "distinct time scales at play .",
    "the first is the mean free time , @xmath37 , eq . , which measures the average time that separates successive collisions with scatterers .    to identify a second timescale , which characterizes the motion of a point particle on the billiard table , consider a lattice of unit cells each shifted by one half of a unit length in both vertical and horizontal directions , so that obstacles are now sitting at the cells corners rather than at their centers .",
    "the average time it takes for a particle at unit speed to exit a cell after it entered it ( with position and velocity distributed according to the liouville measure for the poincar section given by the four line segments delimiting each cell ) is @xcite @xmath108 the residence time @xmath109 provides a natural time unit of lattice displacements .",
    "note that , whereas @xmath37 , eq .",
    ", diverges in the limit of small scatterers , @xmath110 , @xmath109 diverges in the opposite limit of narrow corridors , @xmath111 .    in the presence of infinite corridors ,",
    "the other relevant timescale is of course the ballistic one , which , for horizontal and vertical corridors , is , in the units of cell sizes and speed of point particles , @xmath112    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.moments ] , the initial regime , which is dominated by transient effects , is typically longer for the first moment than the second .",
    "for either moment , however , the lengths of transients may depend on several factors , such as the persistence of correlations , or the precise distribution of ballistic segments , which vary with the parameter s value . moreover , in an idealized model such that ballistic segments are independent and identically distributed ( so that correlations are absent ) @xmath99 and @xmath100 display @xmath0 corrections to their asymptotic values @xcite . for the billiard dynamics , we should a fortiori expect a decay not faster than @xmath0 ; the convergence to the asymptotic regime might be even slower .",
    "the distinction between the initial transient regime and that where the moments follow eqs .  - , with fitting parameters displaying small finite - time corrections , is not sharp .",
    "there is in fact no easy way to estimate the length of the initial transient regime , a priori .",
    "empirically , however , we find the initial regime to subdue after a duration between @xmath113 and @xmath114 units of @xmath37 , which , in the range of parameter values @xmath13 investigated , may thus vary from several hundred units of @xmath109 to a few thousand , depending on the value of the parameter .",
    "integration times should therefore be greater than a few thousand units of @xmath109 .",
    "how much greater depends on one s ability to sample ballistic segments over that duration .",
    "since it is known @xcite that the distribution of the lengths of ballistic segments in infinite - horizon periodic lorentz gases decays with the cube of their lengths , @xmath115 let us compare our numerical findings to the following model for the corresponding cumulative distribution , by which we mean the probability of having ballistic segments of lengths at least @xmath116 , @xmath117 incidentally , @xmath118 is equivalent to normalization of the probabilities , for @xmath116 ranging over positive integers .",
    "the @xmath119 decay in the above equation is responsible for the logarithmic divergence of the normalized second moment .    now , suppose that , for times up to @xmath116 , we want to accurately sample ballistic segments of lengths @xmath116assuming that this will imply a good sampling of shorter ballistic segments as well . since point particles have unit speed , the flights of lengths @xmath116 can not experience a collision in the time interval @xmath120 $ ] ( modulo corrections that are negligible for large @xmath116 ) .",
    "they are thus indistinguishable , in the time - frame considered , from flights of lengths @xmath121 , as we do not know when the last collision before time 0 occurred or when the first one after time @xmath116 will .",
    "so we must consider the entire set of ballistic segments of lengths @xmath121 , whose probability is given by , as a whole , and each segment there will contribute with a length @xmath116 , in the time interval @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "accordingly , the number of initial conditions we have to sample in order to accurately measure the moments for times up to @xmath116 grows like @xmath119 .",
    "the tails of the actual distributions of ballistic segments , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.munu ] for @xmath122 , differ from eqs .  - by a numerical factor which is @xmath123 . in the narrow corridor limit ,",
    "transitions between cells are overwhelmingly dominated by segments of unit lengths ; ballistic segments are thus infrequent . away from this limit , however , ballistic trajectories occur at manageable frequencies .    considering the examples displayed in fig .  [ fig.moments ] , the initial transient regime subdues after times roughly @xmath124 . for the parameter values shown , and up to a constant factor of order unity , corridors . the frequency of occurrence of corridors of other types changes according to their relative widths . ] the cumulative distribution of ballistic segments is well approximated by eq .",
    ", at least for @xmath125 .",
    "we thus typically need @xmath126 initial conditions to sample trajectories up to time @xmath127 , but would need @xmath128 initial conditions to sample trajectories for times up to @xmath129 . while the former is within reach of our numerical computations ,",
    "the latter is not , at least not unless one is able to devote about ten years worth of cpu time to it , notwithstanding the impact of the limited accuracy of the integration on the results .",
    "statistical averages are , in practice , limited to ensembles of at most a billion trajectories of duration @xmath130 .",

    "a specificity , however , is in the choice of initial conditions , which are sampled from the standard liouville distribution along the vertical and horizontal borders of a unit cell .",
    "this choice allows to sample trajectories initially in the process of completing a ballistic segment , as part of the equilibrium distribution ; such trajectories would be absent from the statistical ensemble had we instead chosen to distribute initial conditions on the surface of the obstacle , i.e. , where collision events take place .",

    "<S> we perform numerical measurements of the moments of the position of a tracer particle in a two - dimensional periodic billiard model ( lorentz gas ) with infinite corridors . </S>",
    "<S> this model is known to exhibit a weak form of super - diffusion , in the sense that there is a logarithmic correction to the linear growth in time of the mean - squared displacement . </S>",
    "<S> we show numerically that this expected asymptotic behavior is easily overwhelmed by the subleading linear growth throughout the time - range accessible to numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our simulations to the known analytical results for the variance of the anomalously - rescaled limiting normal distributions .        </S>",
    "<S> billiard models are among the simplest dynamical systems , and have proven suited to model problems pertaining to a variety of fields , from experimental to mathematical physics . within the framework of statistical mechanics and nonlinear dynamics , the lorentz gas , which consists of a point - like particle moving freely and bouncing elastically off a set of fixed circular scatterers , has served as a paradigm to study transport properties of light particles among heavier ones . </S>",
    "<S> its lasting popularity is due , in particular , to the fact that it allows to choose different geometries ( disordered or periodic arrangements of the scatterers ) , and to identify regimes of both normal and anomalous transport .    in two dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> when the geometry is periodic and chosen in such a way that the distance between any two successive collisions is bounded above ( the so - called _ finite - horizon condition _ ) , it is known that the transport is normal , which is to say that the distribution of the the displacement vector is asymptotically gaussian , with a variance growing linearly in time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a large body of research on such dispersing _ sinai billiards _ has produced a number of rigorous results about the statistical and transport properties of the periodic lorentz gas @xcite , among which are the exponential decay of correlations for periodic observables @xcite , the central limit theorem and invariance principle , i.e. , convergence to a wiener process , and recurrence . </S>",
    "<S> the same types of results would give recurrence for the typical _ aperiodic _ gas as well @xcite , but proving normal diffusion in that case remains an open problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> see also the recent survey @xcite .    in this article , we are concerned with infinite - horizon periodic lorentz gases , i.e. , such that point particles can move arbitrarily far through regions devoid of obstacles . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to these regions as _ corridors _ , following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; they are elsewhere termed gaps @xcite , horizons @xcite , and free planes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such regions leads to qualitatively different transport than the finite - horizon case , with a weak form of super - diffusion , in the sense that there is a logarithmic correction to the linear growth in time of the mean - squared displacement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion coefficient thus diverges , as initially suggested by friedman and martin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there and elsewhere @xcite , numerical studies of this logarithmic correction often focused on velocity autocorrelation functions , which are expected to decay like @xmath0 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> bleher @xcite gave a semi - rigorous discussion of super - diffusion in the infinite - horizon lorentz gas . </S>",
    "<S> a number of proofs were subsequently obtained for the discrete - time collision map by szsz and varj @xcite , including a local limit law to a normal distribution , as well as recurrence and ergodicity in the full space . </S>",
    "<S> techniques there were based on work of blint and gouzel @xcite for the stadium billiard , which also has long segments of trajectories without a collision on a curved boundary and a normal distribution with a non - standard limit law . </S>",
    "<S> the extension to the continuous - time dynamics was subsequently proved by chernov and dolgopyat @xcite , who , in addition , proved the weak invariance principle in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> while rigorous results are of major theoretical importance , they have thus far not been complemented by convincing numerical measurements of the logarithmic correction to the linear growth in time of the mean - squared displacement , which has proven difficult to characterize . though some authors have reported numerical evidence of this growth @xcite , the only attempt known to us to confront results with known analytic formulae for the asymptotic behavior of the mean - squared displacements @xcite was met with limited success @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a main problem lies in trying to identify only the logarithmic divergence of the mean - squared displacement @xmath1 , while ignoring other relevant terms in its time dependence ; see sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : model ] for precise definitions . as stated by bleher ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * eq .  ( 1.9 ) ) , when @xmath2 , the _ finite - time diffusion coefficient _ , @xmath3 , has the asymptotic behavior @xmath4 see also references @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this asymptotic behavior is attained when @xmath5 , which is numerically unattainable ; cf .  </S>",
    "<S> discussion below . in the pre - asymptotic regime , other terms </S>",
    "<S> must also be taken into account on the right - hand side of this expression , most notably a constant term , which may actually turn out to be the largest contribution when @xmath6 is large but @xmath7 is not . failing to do so , for example , by considering the mean - squared displacement as a function of @xmath8 @xcite , masks the relative contributions of the two terms , and </S>",
    "<S> hence does not allow to accurately measure either of them .    </S>",
    "<S> rather , it is necessary to consider the finite - time diffusion coefficient   as an asymptotically affine function of @xmath7 , taking into account both the intercept and the slope , as was previously applied by one of the present authors in other super - diffusive billiard models @xcite . when @xmath2 , the slope is the second moment of the rescaled process and thus characterizes the strength of this type of super - diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation of the intercept may , on the other hand , not always be clear , for example , when this quantity is negative . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a system which exhibits normal diffusion , this quantity obviously reduces to the standard diffusion coefficient . by extension , </S>",
    "<S> at least so long as the slope is small compared to the intercept , we will think of the intercept as accounting for a diffusive component of the process , coexisting with the anomalous diffusion .    in this paper , we report numerical measurements of these quantities for continuous - time dynamics in two - dimensional periodic lorentz gases with infinite horizon , comparing them to analytical asymptotic results . </S>",
    "<S> we point out several difficulties arising in the numerical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the main one , is that large fluctuations underlie the super - diffusive regime , and these require a very large number of initial conditions for the logarithmic divergences to be observed with sufficient precision . </S>",
    "<S> a typical trajectory exhibits long paths free of collisions , whose frequency of occurrence decays with the cube of their lengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to these free paths as ballistic segments , i.e. , segments of a trajectory separating two successive collisions with obstacles . </S>",
    "<S> although they may be rare , long ballistic segments contribute significantly to the mean - squared displacement measured over the corresponding time scale .    </S>",
    "<S> this observation points to a second , often underestimated problem , which is that the integration time should be neither too short , nor too long ; on the one hand there are long transients before the asymptotic behavior sets in , so that integration times must not be too short ; on the other hand , long integration times require averaging over prohibitively large number of trajectories to achieve a proper sampling of ballistic segments .    </S>",
