    "galaxy formation and evolution in the cosmological context is one of the leading themes in observational cosmology today , with much effort being currently dedicated using all facilities both on the ground and in space .",
    "the goal is to map the evolution of the population of galaxies as a function of redshift ( cosmic epoch ) and environment , with each population being described by distribution functions of mass , star formation rate ( sfr ) , morphology , agn activity , etc .",
    "this is accomplished through a full multiwavelength approach , covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum , so to ensure the most robust characterization of each individual galaxy .",
    "this growing body of observational evidence has started to provide enough data for a fully empirical reconstruction of the main trends in the evolution of galaxies , such as their mass growth via star formation and merging , and the quenching of their star formation activity , turning them into passively - evolving , early type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in parallel , these observational constraints are continuously fed into theoretical simulations , forcing them to match closer and closer the picture that is progressively emerging from observations .",
    "quenching of star formation is perhaps the most dramatic event in the evolution of galaxies , turning them into passively - evolving galaxies ( pegs ) .",
    "hence , properly mapping this transformation across cosmic times and in a range of environments must be central in our attempt to understand galaxy evolution .",
    "indeed , massive pegs represent the culmination of the galaxy evolution process and are known to be the most strongly clustered galaxies locally as well as at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "besides marking the highest density peaks , pegs ( ellipticals ) are extremely interesting on their own . in the local universe",
    "pegs ( including bulges ) encompass almost 60% of the total stellar mass @xcite , and therefore the formation and evolution of this type of galaxies are central to the broader problem of galaxy evolution in general .",
    "a most extended and coherent effort to map galaxy evolution up to @xmath17 is certainly the cosmos project @xcite with full multiwavelength imaging coverage of an equatorial 2 square degree field . besides the imaging campaign extending from the x - rays to radio ,",
    "a major spectroscopic effort over this field has been conducted with the very large telescope ( vlt ) , targeting galaxies all the way to @xmath18 ( the zcosmos project , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and in preparation ) .",
    "as a result , spectra and redshifts have been obtained for @xmath19 galaxies up to @xmath20 over the full cosmos field ( zcosmos - bright ) and for @xmath21 galaxies at @xmath22 over its central square degree ( zcosmos - deep ) .",
    "thus , mapping the evolution of pegs as a function of mass , redshift and environment has been fairly well accomplished up to @xmath23 , especially as part of the zcosmos - bright project ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is a claim that the most massive pegs are virtually all in place by @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , their number density rapidly falls at higher redshifts as suggested by the number density of pegs at @xmath24 being only @xmath25 of that of local ellipticals of similar mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , much of the current statistics of @xmath0 pegs relies on photometric redshifts , which are not accurate enough to properly map the density field at these high redshifts .",
    "this is especially the case for the highest density regions , where environmental effects are presumably strongest , and likely to be preferentially inhabited by pegs which are the most strongly clustered population at @xmath26 @xcite . as a consequence , it is not currently possible to measure the fraction of red ( quenched ) galaxies at @xmath27 as a function of overdensity , as done at lower redshifts by @xcite .",
    "in fact , due to instrumental limitations the high - redshift component of the zcosmos survey has been designed to observe only star - forming galaxies ( down to @xmath28 ) , and therefore none of the @xmath29 @xmath30 passively evolving galaxies brighter than @xmath31 was included among the targets .",
    "thus , with zcosmos - deep alone one can not study this important galaxy population , hence one can not properly map the highest peaks of the density field at these redshifts .    beyond @xmath32 , only a handful of such galaxies have been observed spectroscopically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xcite for a recent compilation ) , and their stellar populations dated .",
    "except for such rare cases , the stellar population properties of high-@xmath33 pegs have been explored only via their broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , or with intermediate - width passbands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "besides locating individual pegs relative to the density field , full spectroscopic coverage is instead essential to alleviate the age  metallicity degeneracy and to get dynamical information , in particular in the rest - frame optical where features are extensively used and calibrated for this purpose in local elliptical galaxies .    at redshifts below @xmath34 the strong spectral features that allow one to measure the redshift of pegs are the h&k lines and the 4000   break , but by @xmath35 these features move to the near - ir .",
    "the only useful spectral feature for optical spectroscopy then remains the complex of rest - frame uv absorption lines of neutral and ionized iron and magnesium in the @xmath36 spectral range , where the continuum of pegs is very faint .",
    "nevertheless , this feature has been used to derive redshifts and stellar ages for most of the few passive galaxies at @xmath30 with spectroscopic information ( see references above ) . however , reaching the extremely faint uv continuum of a passive galaxy requires extremely long integrations , which in the case of @xcite ranged from @xmath37 to 60 hours per object .",
    "alternatively , one can try to follow the h&k lines and the 4000   break in the near - ir , where the continuum flux is much higher ( but also the background ) .",
    "this was attempted with long - slit spectroscopy with gnirs on gemini by @xcite resulting in 17 spectroscopic redshifts of pegs at @xmath38 judged from the absence of emission lines .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy in the near - ir offers decisive advantages over optical or single - channel near - ir spectroscopy of high - redshift pegs , and the multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mounted on the subaru telescope offered an unique opportunity amongst 810 m class telescopes . in 2006",
    "we then started a project exploiting this opportunity and , after a few unsuccessful runs , useful data have started to accumulate from 2009 on and the results are presented in this paper .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : obs ] we describe our dataset ; redshift identifications are presented and compared to photometric redshifts in section [ sec : speczz ] , whereas the presence of several peg redshift spikes is discussed in section [ sec : overdensity ] . in section [ sec : stacking ] a composite spectrum corresponding to @xmath39 hours of integration is presented .",

    "besides maximizing the yield , targeting pbzkconcentrations allows us to check whether such concentrations are mere statistical fluctuations in surface density , or real physical structures .",
    "thanks to the wide 2 square degree field of cosmos , several concentrations with at least 15 pbzkswith @xmath61 per moircs field of view were identified ; * regions including some of the 12 brightest pbzksstudied by @xcite , hence ensuring the brightest possible continuum emission and the detection of absorption features with as high a s / n as possible .    considering the above constraints , we selected a fov containing the object 254025 at @xmath62 @xcite which is one of the 12 brightest galaxies in @xcite , and observed it in 2009 finding a possible overdensity of pbzkswith spectroscopic redshift at @xmath62 ( see section [ sec : overdensity ] )",
    ". motivated by this finding , we then selected two more adjacent fovs to cover a possible large scale structure around it as well as to maximize the number of the brightest pbzksin each mask .",

    "the orange squares and green diamonds represent passively evolving galaxies from the compilation of @xcite with spectroscopic redshifts respectively in the range @xmath671 ( the same as in our study ) and at @xmath672 .",
    "the solid line refers to the mean mass  size relation for @xmath673 passive galaxies in sdss from @xcite and the gray shaded bands show the @xmath243 , @xmath354 and @xmath339 deviations from such relation . ]     from @xcite at the same stellar mass . ]",
    "one effect contributing to the evolution of the mass  size relation of pegs comes from the progressive quenching of larger star - forming galaxies @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "one expect that younger , i.e. , recently quenched , pegs have size close to the local relation , while older ones , i.e. , quenched at an earlier time , are more compact .",
    "if so , one would expect some correlation between the sed - derived age and a departure from the local mass - size relation .",
    "based on the sed ages of 62 spectroscopically identified pegs at @xmath674 , @xcite claimed that the normal size high-@xmath33 elliptical galaxies have relatively younger stellar population ages compared to the compact ones that would show a wider range of formation redshifts with a large fraction of them having formed at @xmath675 . in contrast , @xcite found that younger pegs at @xmath676 are more centrally concentrated and may have slightly smaller sizes . to check for this effect in our sample ,",
    "we have compared the size and age indicators , namely ages from broad - band sed fitting and dn4000 indices .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : agesize ] compares the size normalized to the local mass - size relation with the age from the sed fitting . besides the present pbzksample ,",
    "the sed ages of spectroscopically identified pegs at similar redshifts from @xcite and @xcite are also shown for comparison . as pointed out by @xcite , in their data there appears to be a weak trend with compact galaxies showing a wider range of sed ages compared to normal - size ones that tend to show younger ages . splitting our sample at @xmath677 ( @xmath339 deviation from the local mass  size relation ) , the median of @xmath678 are 9.15 and 9.40 for the normal and compact galaxies , respectively , i.e. , the compact galaxies appear to be @xmath679 ( or about 1 gyr ) older than the normal ones .",
    "when only the objects with @xmath668 are considered , the median @xmath680 are 9.10 and 9.35 for normal and compact objects , respectively .",
    "note that the uncertainties in the sed ages are typically comparable to these differences .    the right panel of figure [ fig : agesize ] shows the relation between the normalized size and dn4000 , which can be taken as a proxy for stellar population age . for comparison ,",
    "a compact quenched galaxy at @xmath681 @xcite is also shown . excluding the object with exceptionally large dn4000 ( @xmath682 )",
    ", there seems to be essentially no trend between size and dn4000 .",
    "the median dn4000 of the normal and compact objects are 1.61 and 1.55 , respectively , a difference comparable to the typical @xmath243 error in dn4000 measurement . restricting the sample to the brightest objects , the median dn4000 of normal and compact objects are 1.42 and 1.50 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that in our sample there is no strong correlation between the size of high redshift pegs and stellar population age .",
    "a similar conclusion is also found for the brightest objects for which the size measurements are more reliable . to draw any firm conclusions it is essential to construct a larger sample with robustly measured size and dn4000 .          for the brightest object in the sample ( 254025 ) a @xmath243 upper limit to its stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath683 @xmath241 )",
    "was placed by @xcite based on our moircs 2009 data . by adding the data taken in 2010 we have been able to upgrade this upper limit to a true measurement of @xmath573 .",
    "we used a fwhm of 27  at the observed wavelength for the instrumental profile and assumed the resolution to be constant in linear wavelength scale across the wavelength range of interest .",
    "we have restricted the analysis to the @xmath684@xmath685  rest frame wavelength range with @xmath686 in 60 km s@xmath15 spectral interval , which encompasses features such as cn , h&k , h@xmath375 , the g band , h@xmath376 and fe 4383 .",
    "we determined a dispersion @xmath687 @xmath241 from 300 realizations of ppxffits that consider not only the effect of random noise , but also explore the effect of sky residuals and different input parameters in ppxf , as described in section [ sec : specz ] . here for @xmath688 we take the median of the distribution and the @xmath243 error is determined as @xmath689 where @xmath690 and @xmath691 correspond respectively to the 84- and 16-percentiles of the probability distribution .",
    "we emphasize that the quoted error is very conservative , as a formal random error of only 32 @xmath241 is indicated by single ppxffits .",
    "we quote instead an error of 105 @xmath241 derived above as a more realistic value that includes an estimate of the systematic errors .",
    "figure [ fig : dynprop ] compares the structural and dynamical properties of the galaxy 254025 with those of local early type galaxies and with those from the small sample of @xmath692 pegs for which a stellar velocity dispersion has been measured .",
    "dynamical masses are derived as @xmath693 where @xmath694 is the gravitational constant , and we obtained @xmath695 for the galaxy 254025 .",
    "figure [ fig : dynprop ] is an update of the similar figure presented in @xcite .",
    "we can thus confirm that this galaxy closely follows all the local relations involving the dynamical mass , the effective radius and the stellar velocity dispersion within the error bars .",
    "again , this is a proof of the coexistence at high redshifts of pegs that appear structurally and dynamically similar to their local counterparts with other galaxies that are more compact and are correspondingly characterized by a higher velocity dispersion .",
    "as our spectroscopic identification of the pegs with @xmath696 or @xmath697 is nearly complete over the surveyed area , we can estimate the abundance of massive pegs at @xmath30 , to within cosmic variance errors .",
    "the redshift range covered by the present sample @xmath698 over the survey area of 66.2 arcmin@xmath699 contains a comoving volume of @xmath700 mpc@xmath701 .",
    "thus , from the 16 objects with @xmath696 we estimate a comoving number density of @xmath702 mpc@xmath703 , and the corresponding stellar mass density is @xmath704 mpc@xmath703 , with an uncertainty of @xmath705 from poisson statistics .",
    "these should be regarded as upper limits since the field was chosen for its overdensity of pegs .",
    "however they are in agreement with estimates derived from a complete sample of galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field of @xmath706 mpc@xmath703 and @xmath707@xmath708 mpc@xmath703 ( after converting to chabrier imf ) , as measured by @xcite for spectroscopically identified pegs at @xmath709 down to the limit @xmath710 , although their explored comoving volume is @xmath9 times smaller .    @xcite have derived number and mass densities of pegs at @xmath711 from the newfirm medium band survey ( nmbs ) , covering an area of @xmath229 deg@xmath225 , and for the mean redshift of our galaxies ( @xmath382 ) found @xmath712 mpc@xmath703 and @xmath713 mpc@xmath703 , respectively .",
    "our estimates are somewhat higher , as expected given the mentioned overdensity bias .    comparing to the corresponding local values , respectively @xmath714 mpc@xmath703 and @xmath715 mpc@xmath703 from @xcite , taken at face value",
    "our result suggests that pegs at @xmath716 account for @xmath717 of the number density and @xmath718@xmath719 of the stellar mass density of local pegs with @xmath720 .",
    "mapping the 3d space distribution of passively evolving galaxies at high redshift is an endeavour of critical importance in the broader context of galaxy evolution and observational cosmology .",
    "however , it is perhaps also the most challenging observationally , as it requires many hundreds of hours of 8m - class telescope time with current instrumentation .",
    "emission lines are absent ( or very weak ) in the spectra of pegs , and therefore measuring redshifts and velocity dispersions must rely uniquely on absorption lines . with spectrometers working at optical wavelengths , for such objects at @xmath0",
    "this is possible using absorption lines over an intrinsically very faint uv continuum , which requires extremely long integration times . using near - ir ,",
    "multiobject spectrometers offers a potentially attractive alternative , as the strongest spectral features over a strong continuum become accessible .",
    "however , ground based , infrared spectroscopy of faint , high redshift objects is affected by a higher sky and thermal background which largely limits this advantage . using the moircs instrument at the subaru telescope",
    "we have started a pilot experiment aimed at studying a sample of bright pegs at @xmath0 while assessing the feasibility of a more ambitious project .    with this objective , we have first identified the strongest concentrations of high-@xmath33 candidate pegs over the cosmos field , and focused our observational effort over one such concentration and its immediate vicinity .",
    "a sample of 34 objects has been observed , with integration times ranging from 280 to 550 minutes , and the continuum has been detected in 18 of them .",
    "the redshift of these detected galaxies are concentrated in three spikes at @xmath5 , 1.53 and 1.82 , and the last two galaxies have quite similar redshifts around 1.67 .",
    "this spectroscopically confirms the strong clustering of high redshift pegs , previously hinted only from their 2-point correlation function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a comparison with cosmos photometric redshifts shows that @xmath721 of them agree closely with the spectroscopic redshifts , whereas the other @xmath722 of them are systematically underestimated by up to @xmath4 .",
    "thus , these photometric redshifts can lead to a sizable underestimate of the volume density of pegs at @xmath0 .",
    "however , we show that photometric redshift training with these spectroscopic redshifts can significantly improve their performance for high-@xmath33 pegs .",
    "having fixed the redshifts to their spectroscopic values , we have explored the stellar population content of these galaxies , measuring their masses , luminosity - weighted ages and metallicities using various sed - fitting techniques .",
    "stellar masses range from @xmath723 to @xmath724 , ages from @xmath11 to @xmath549 gyr , whereas near - solar metallicity is found for most galaxies .",
    "the lick h@xmath12 and the dn4000 indices allowed us to investigate further the stellar population content and evolutionary stage of the sample galaxies .",
    "we find that about 40% of the pbzksshow large dn4000 ( around 2 ) which indicates that these galaxies are already quenched long ago compared to their timescale of star formation . on the other hand , about 60% of them",
    "have dn4000 values close to those of young star - forming or post - starburst galaxies , which indicates that these galaxies have been quenched more recently , given the lack of the star - forming activity ( except for one object with a mid - ir detection ) .",
    "this is also confirmed for the four most massive and brightest objects and the composite spectrum with measurable h@xmath375 absorption line .",
    "two of them ( as well as the composite spectrum , see below ) show moderate dn4000 and h@xmath12 , consistent with the early stages of a post - starburst galaxy where star formation has been quenched very recently .",
    "the other two bright galaxies show both large dn4000 and h@xmath12 and appear to be already passive , possibly with a recent episode of star - formation , though the combination of two indices seems rather extreme .",
    "the composite spectrum of the 17 galaxies exhibits several well - detected spectral features , notably cn , h&k , the g band , h@xmath725 , mg@xmath304 and various iron lines .",
    "a fit to this composite spectrum indicates that it is dominated by old , metal - rich stellar populations with a mass - weighted age of @xmath726 gyr .",
    "the fit is somewhat dependent on the allowed age and metallicity ranges , but the existence of stellar population younger than @xmath727 myr is always excluded by the fits , which is confirmed by the use of another fitting code adopting a different input ssp library .",
    "the structural parameters , ( circularized ) effective radius and srsicindex , have been measured for these galaxies over the _",
    "hst_/acs _ i_-band image of the cosmos field .",
    "a majority of the 18 galaxies have effective radii somewhat lower than equally massive galaxies in the local universe , with some up to three times lower .",
    "however , almost about a third of the galaxies appear to be on , or close to , the local @xmath728 relation , confirming that compact and apparently normal pegs coexist at these redshifts .",
    "finally , the stellar velocity dispersion of the brightest galaxy in the sample was measured as @xmath729 @xmath241 .",
    "combined with its effective radius and stellar mass , this value of @xmath573 confirms that this @xmath62 galaxy closely follows all the local structural and dynamical relations for pegs .",
    "the nearly complete identification of pegs at the top end of their stellar mass function at the observed redshift range allows us to estimate their number and stellar mass densities , still with the proviso that they refer to an overdensity region .",
    "thus , the pegs with @xmath730 at @xmath731 we found in the studied field correspond to about 50% of the number and about 3540% of the stellar mass densities of local pegs with similar stellar mass .    without counting the time lost to technical problems and bad weather",
    ", this project has used 45 nights of subaru telescope time . over the whole 2 square degree cosmos field",
    "one can roughly count @xmath313 concentrations of candidate high-@xmath33 pegs similar to the one explored in the present study .",
    "thus , some 80100 nights would be required to map all such concentrations in a similar fashion with subaru / moircs .",
    "obviously , even more would be required to map the distribution of all massive pegs over the entire cosmos field . a coordinated effort with the upcoming near - ir multi - object spectrographs at 810 m class telescopes ( such as gemini / flamingos - ii , vlt / kmos , and keck / mosfire )",
    "would be required to make such large project feasible in the near future .",
    "we thank the staffs of the subaru telescope , especially ichi tanaka , for supporting the observations .",
    "we also thank mariska kriek for a permission to use fast , stephan charlot for providing the stellar population synthesis models before publication , alexis finoguenov for computing the upper limits from xmm - newton data for the overdense regions , masayuki tanaka for checking the existence of red sequence cluster around redshift spikes , and masafumi yagi for fruitful discussion .",
