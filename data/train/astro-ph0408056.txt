    "clusters of galaxies signal the largest gravitationally bound dark matter halos in the universe .",
    "they are mildly aspherical systems that tend to be aligned by mergers directed by interconnecting filaments in the cosmic web .    since the early days of extragalactic astronomy",
    ", it has been apparent that clusters are generally elongated on the sky .",
    "flattening of these clusters due to rotation was ruled out @xcite and many assumed that the flattening was due to gravitational instabilities expected in the top - down scenario of zeldovich ( 1978 ) and doroshkevich ( 1978 ) .",
    "the groundbreaking work of carter and metcalfe ( 1980 ) showed that the aspherical shape of a cluster was connected with the velocity anisotropy of the orbits of cluster galaxies .",
    "binney and silk ( 1979 ) proposed that this anisotropy was due to tidal distortion from neighboring large - scale structure .",
    "binggeli ( 1982 ) was the first to investigate alignments of close cluster pairs .",
    "he studied 44 abell clusters and found that galaxies separated by less than 30 mpc show a strong alignment with each other and that the orientation of a cluster was dependent on the distribution of surrounding clusters .",
    "other observational claims of cluster alignments have been made , both with nearest neighbors and with other clusters in the same supercluster @xcite .    with some exceptions ( for example , struble and peebles ( 1985 ) or rhee and katgert ( 1987 ) ) , most work in the literature",
    "@xcite confirms binggeli s original results .",
    "west ( 1989a ) uses 48 abell superclusters and finds a tendency for clusters within @xmath11 to be aligned .",
    "plionis ( 1994 ) measures alignments for 637 lick clusters and finds strong alignments up to @xmath12 with weaker alignments out to @xmath11 .",
    "west et al . ( 1995 ) finds a marked anisotropy for einstein clusters extending out to @xmath13 .",
    "simulations have shown that spatial alignments , intrinsically predicted from the top - down model @xcite , are also seen in bottom - up ( cold dark matter ) scenarios , where halos form by mergers of smaller structures organized along filaments @xcite .",
    "simulations also show that the orientation of the major axis of a galaxy cluster is aligned with the direction of the last major merger event @xcite . since cluster alignments appear to be a generic outcome of gravitational instability , their use as a discriminant of cosmological models requires careful calibration @xcite .    in the halo model description of non - linear structure ( cooray and sheth 2002 ) ,",
    "all matter is contained in bounded , spatially correlated regions ( the halo population ) that span a spectrum of sizes .",
    "most instances of this model assume spherically symmetric halos , but more precise versions will need to take into account the spectrum of halo shapes , including detailed internal structure ( jing & suto 2002 ) , as well the spatial correlation of the shapes of neighboring halos ( jing 2002 ; faltenbacher 2003 ) .    in this paper , we report measurements of shape statistics , including spatial ( or _ mark _ ) correlations of alignments , derived from large samples of massive dark matter halos extracted from hubble volume simulations .",
    "we investigate two flat - metric cosmologies (  and ) dominated by vacuum energy and dark matter , respectively .",
    "we focus on the former , more empirically satisfying model , but show results for the latter for comparative purposes .",
    "section  2 provides details of the simulations and describes our method of finding principal axis orientations and magnitudes for mass - limited halo samples . in   3 , we use poisson realizations of isothermal spheres to estimate systematic error in mean shape measurement due to shot noise . we then present axial ratio distribution functions for mass - limited samples , and characterize the dependence of halo shape on mass and redshift . section  4 presents mark correlations of  cluster alignments and briefly examines the role of supercluster membership on shape . a final section reviews our conclusions .    unless explicitly stated otherwise ,",

    "the large hubble volume ( hv ) simulations provide statistical power but poor mass resolution , while higher resolution , but smaller volume , virgo simulations are used for resolution tests .",
    "the hv simulations are a pair of gigaparticle n - body simulations created using a parallel version of the hydra n - body code @xcite .",
    "random realizations of two cosmologies with flat spatial metric are produced : a   model with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and power spectrum normalization @xmath20 and a  model with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the dark matter structure is resolved by particles of mass @xmath24 within periodic cubic volumes of length 3000 and @xmath25 , respectively ( see table [ tab : models ] ) .",

    "these simulations have order - of - magnitude improved mass resolution but much smaller samples than the hv simulations .",
    "we define dark matter halos with a spherical overdensity ( so ) group finder that identifies as a halo the set of particles lying within a sphere of size , centered on a particle that represents a local density maximum filtered on a scale of @xmath30 .",

    "roughly @xmath35 of halos are found to have overlapping @xmath31 spheres .",
    "we retain both members of an overlapping pair in the halo sample .",
    "in addition to the traditional mode of fixed proper - time output , sky survey samples , consisting of data collected along the past light cone of hypothetical observers located within the computational volume , were also generated by the hv simulations .",
    "we use two octant surveys ( po and no ) that cover @xmath36 sterad and extend to @xmath37 for   and 1.25 for , as well as two full - sky surveys ( ms and vs ) that reach @xmath38 for   and 0.42 for . the octants sample structure over the last @xmath39 ( @xmath40cdm ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath42cdm ) of the age of the universe , approximately a 10 gyr look - back time .",
    "halos in these surveys are defined using the so method described above .      given the modest resolution of the hv data , we take a simple approach and estimate the shape of a halo using the moments of the material within .    with respect to the center of the halo ( defined by the local gravitational potential minimum ) , we compute the @xmath43 symmetric tensor @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the j@xmath47 component of the displacement vector of particle @xmath48 relative to the halo center and @xmath49 is the number of ( equal mass ) particles in the halo .",

    "velocity moments are solved for in a similar way , using a mean defined as the center of mass velocity of the material within @xmath31 .",
    "for compactness of notation , we define intermediate and minor axial ratios as follows @xmath59 @xmath60    we have confirmed that the halo population is oriented randomly with respect to the cartesian coordinates of the simulation , as required by the cosmological principal .",
    "we begin this section by estimating the error on shape determinations due to shot noise . from monte carlo realizations of distorted isothermal spheres , we find that population mean values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are accurate to a few percent if @xmath63 .",
    "we then present the joint distribution function @xmath64 at @xmath26 , and investigate joint position and velocity shape statistics .",
    "we follow with the mass and redshift dependence of the minor axis ratio .",
    "to calibrate the error in mean shape due to the small numbers of particles used to resolve clusters in the hv , we carry out the following resolution test .",
    "halo models are created using a set of @xmath49 particles with an initially spherical , isothermal profile . to simulate the mean ellipticity of the hv cluster samples discussed below , each cluster",
    "is then compressed along the @xmath65-axes by fixed amounts ( 0.65 , 0.8 ) .",
    "the particle moments are calculated and used to estimate the shape of each cluster in the same manner as for the hv clusters ( see section 2.4 ) . generating ensembles at several values of @xmath49 , we calibrate the bias in mean cluster shape as a function of mass resolution .",

    "other viable approaches , such as friends - of - friends grouping or use of an ellipsoidal boundary can systematically shift shape measurements by many percent ( warren 1992 , jing & suto 2002 ) .",
    "we leave it to future work to address such systematic effects in detail .",
    "the finding that halos are rounder in velocity space may be at least partly due the effects of ongoing mergers .",
    "mergers will scatter in velocity space first , followed by mixing and relaxation of particle positions .",
    "another factor pushing in the same direction is that the gravitational potential that drives the velocity field is rounder than the density distribution .",
    "we do not attempt to formally fit the joint probability distribution @xmath86 , as doing so would requite a full deconvolution of the effects of shot noise . however , to give an indication of the joint pdf shape , we locate the peak in the intermediate axis conditional probability @xmath87 and record the modal intermediate axis ratio @xmath88 as a function of minor axis ratio @xmath61 .",

    "we quantify the alignment between position and velocity in a halo through the scalar product of its major axis eigenvectors @xmath98 figure [ fig : thetapv ] shows cumulative probability functions of this statistic for the  hv and virgo models .",

    "the higher resolution virgo runs show even stronger position - velocity alignment , with median values of 15 degrees for  and 14 degrees for the  simulation .",
    "when the same analysis is carried out using only strongly ellipsoidal clusters ( @xmath99 ) , the results do not significantly change .",
    "our results are consistent with a higher resolution study of tormen ( 1997 ) , who finds from simulations of 9 dark matter halos resolved by 20,000 particles that the position - velocity alignment angle is approximately 30 degrees .    to further define the relationship between position and velocity space , we show the joint distribution of minor axis ratios @xmath100 in figure [ fig : ca_pvsv ] .",

    "the bold contour shows the median of the enclosed distribution .",
    "since essentially all cluster detection methods use some power of projected mass density as a defining signal , the spatial - velocity alignments examined here will introduce an orientation bias in estimates of velocity dispersions for clusters lying close to the sample detection threshold .",
    "the magnitude of this effect will depend on the specific sample in question , but the general trend will be for the line - of - sight dispersion to overestimate its isotropic counterpart , by a fractional amount that could be @xmath106 for small samples of moderate signal - to - noise detections . estimating the effect for particular observational surveys is best done using monte carlo sample realizations , such as those performed for the 2mass ( kochanek 2003 ) and sdss ( miller 2004 ; wechsler 2004 ) samples .      because mergers are directed along large - scale filaments in the cosmic web ,",
    "the birth of dark matter halos is an inherently asymmetric process .",
    "as a merger evolves , dynamical relaxation will tend to drive a halo closer to isotropy .",
    "one then expects that dynamically younger clusters will be more strongly ellipsoidal than older ones . equating dynamical age with elapsed time from a halo s formation epoch ( defined , for example , using the mass accretion history by wechsler 2002 ) , we expect high mass halos at a given epoch will be more elongated than those of lower mass .",
    "similarly , at fixed mass , high - z halos should be more ellipsoidal than their low - z counterparts of the same mass .    with the large number of clusters in the @xmath26 sample , we first investigate the mass dependence at the present epoch . figure  [ fig : ca_m ]",

    ". the mean minor axis ratios of both the position and velocity shapes vary by only @xmath107 percent as the mass changes by a factor of ten . for the  model , a fit to a logarithmic mass dependence using hv data above @xmath108 and virgo data below yields @xmath109 @xmath110 where @xmath14 is the halo mass measure @xmath15 expressed in units of @xmath16 .",
    "although these expressions are good fits to the shape dependence over two orders of magnitude in mass , the limit @xmath111 requires that the shape at masses approaching @xmath112 must deviate this form .",
    "simulations of smaller - scale structure will be needed to probe this regime .",
    "the  model halos are more ellipsoidal and display somewhat weaker mass dependence than their  counterparts . more vigorous growth of linear perturbations in the  model drives a higher frequency of halo mergers in this model ( lacey & cole 1994 ) , and this may explain why the  halos have a mean @xmath61 that is @xmath113 smaller than the  value .",
    "the velocity shapes of the  model present a more puzzling result , in that the logarithmic slope @xmath114 is significantly shallower that the  mass behavior .",
    "we suspect that our correction for poisson noise may be inadequate for the velocities in this case ( the mass resolution in the  virgo run is poorer than that of the  virgo run , so corrections are larger for this model ) .",
    "the flat behavior of velocity shape for the few most massive hv clusters also drives down the slope .",

    "filaments serve as a source of alignment for halo shapes .",
    "simulations show that this alignment persists into the non - linear regime ( van haarlem & van de weygaert 1993 ) .    in this section , we present mark correlations of shape , using two measures employed previously by faltenbacher ( 2003 ) .",
    "we also examine whether clusters that are members of superclusters have shapes that differ from the general population . for the sake of brevity , we present results for the  case only .",
    "several observational studies have probed the significance and length scale of spatial shape correlations of galaxy clusters .",
    "plionis ( 1994 ) , using galaxy positions in 637 abell clusters , presents evidence for nearest neighbor alignment extending to separations @xmath12 at @xmath176 significance , with weaker alignment to @xmath177 .",
    "fuller , west , & bridges ( 1999 ) used the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) in poor mkw and awm clusters and found significant alignments for bcg - cluster pairs and bcg - nearest cluster pairs .",
    "simulations demonstrate that alignments are to be expected . using a sample of several hundred clusters more massive than @xmath178 derived from a @xmath160particle   simulation , onuora & thomas ( 2000 ) detect an alignment signal for pairs extending to @xmath9 , with the strongest signal for nearest neighbors . like the position ",
    "velocity alignments of figure  [ fig : thetapv ] , they note that the signal is persistent and changes little when only strongly elongated halos are used .",
    "faltenbacher ( 2003 ; hereafter f03 ) examine 3000 clusters more massive than @xmath179 from a   simulation of a @xmath180 region .",
    "they introduce the use of mark correlations to measure the behavior of alignment as a function of radial scale , and find positive signal extending to @xmath12 and @xmath181 for two different alignment measures .",
    "hatton and ninin ( 2001 ) measure spatial alignments of halo pair angular momentums that extend to similar scales .    following f03 , we quantify orientation alignment with two different measures .",
    "consider an ensemble of clusters pairs , each with members @xmath182 and @xmath183 that have comoving spatial separation @xmath184 between @xmath101 and @xmath185 .",
    "a basic alignment measure ( termed @xmath186 by f03 ) uses the scalar product of major - axis directions @xmath56 @xmath187 where @xmath188 denotes an ensemble average over pairs of separation @xmath101 .    a second , `` filamentary '' measure ( @xmath189 of f03 ) compares halo major - axis orientation to pair separation direction @xmath190 for random halo orientations , both measures have expectation value @xmath191 .",
    "we therefore use the deviations from this expectation @xmath192 and @xmath193 as a measure of pairwise alignment .",
    "figure [ fig : du_dw ] shows the  position - space alignment signals at @xmath74 for the sample of 83,000 halos with masses @xmath69 .",
    "open circles show @xmath194 and filled circles give @xmath195 .",
    "error bars are the uncertainty in the binned mean values . for comparison ,",
    "squares show the two - point spatial correlation function @xmath196 of the mass - limited sample with correlation length @xmath197 ( colberg 2000 ) .",
    "filled squares show positive spatial correlations while open squares show @xmath198 in the region of negative correlations @xmath199 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath200 and @xmath201 on a linear scale .",
    "the basic measure shows excess alignment out to scales @xmath202 .",
    "the filamentary statistic shows non - random halo orientations extending to scales @xmath203 , nearly ten times the correlation length and well into the anti - correlated regime of the two - point function . in both cases ,",
    "the excess alignment signal is well fit by a power law at large radii that saturates at small @xmath101 .",
    "the basic alignments follow @xmath204 while the filamentary alignment is well fit by @xmath205    our findings are generally consistent with those of f03 , but our improved statistics and larger linear scale allow the first detailed fits to the effect .",
    "although an analytic foundation for the specific form of equations  ( [ eq : ufit ] ) and ( [ eq : wfit ] ) is not yet in hand , we speculate that a solution may be found by applying the theoretical machinery describing peaks in gaussian random noise fields ( bardeen 1986 ; bond & myers 1996 ) .",
    "f03 note that the filamentary signal remains strong in projection , but their analysis is optimistic in that it assumes perfect knowledge of three - dimensional halo separations as well as the projected three - dimensional halo shapes .",
    "a more appropriate treatment will require analysis of galaxy cluster samples derived from mock catalogs ( kochanek & white 2003 ; wechsler 2004 ) .",
    "one might reasonably expect local cluster environment to play a role in determining halo shapes .",
    "in particular , since superclusters  groups of cluster - mass halos  tend to have strong filamentary morphology , one might anticipate that the formation dynamics of supercluster members may lead to a distribution of shapes that is biased toward more elongated systems .    to address this question , we identify superclusters in the @xmath206 hv halo population by applying a percolation algorithm with linking length @xmath207 , one - third the @xmath208 mean intercluster spacing of the sample mass - limited at @xmath108 .",
    "we further require that each supercluster have five or more halo members above the mass cutoff .",
    "this selects the @xmath209 most strongly clustered halos .",
    "figure  [ fig : supercl ] shows the distribution of minor axis ratios in position and velocity for the supercluster members and the general population .",
    "the axial ratios of the supercluster population have a nearly gaussian distribution with means and dispersions presented in table [ tab : supercl ] . comparing supercluster members to the general population ( table [ tab : peak ] )",
    ", we find no difference in mean values at the level of @xmath85 in axial ratio ; both have @xmath210 in position and @xmath211 in velocity .",
    "this finding lends support to the picture in which the halo formation history is largely independent of large - scale environment ( bower 1991 ; sheth and tormen 1999 , 2004 ) .",
    "cccccc position & 6683 & 0.638 & 0.092 & 0.776 & 0.096 + velocity & & 0.704 & 0.080 & 0.818 & 0.088 +",
    "we use dark matter halos samples from billion  particle n - body simulations to measure statistical properties of halo shapes .",
    "the main  samples consist of @xmath212 halos at @xmath74 and @xmath213 halos from sky survey output with masses @xmath69 . for each halo , a moment analysis of density and velocity structure within @xmath31 is used to define the principal axes of an equivalent ellipsoid .",
    "higher resolution simulations and random realizations of isothermal spheres demonstrate that systematic errors due to discreteness are less than @xmath214 in mean axial ratio for the main hv samples .",
    "massive halos have a gaussian distribution of axis ratios , with intrinsic dispersion @xmath215 and a mean minor axis ratio @xmath216 that tends weakly toward rounder systems at lower mass and redshift ( @xmath217 and @xmath218 for position , see tables [ tab : ca_m ] and [ tab : ca_z ] ) .",
    "halos are rounder in velocity than in position space , a finding that likely reflects more efficient scattering in velocity space and the rounder nature of the gravitational potential compared to the density field . the principal axes in position and velocity are strongly correlated ; 50% of halos have alignment angles smaller than 22 degrees .",
    "we also provide a gaussian fit to the joint probability density of minor axis ratios in position and velocity .",
    "we investigate mark correlations of cluster shape using two statistics introduced by faltenbacher ( 2003 ) .",
    "we measure significant excess alignment of halos extending to @xmath219 for the basic measure and to @xmath203 for the filamentary statistic .",
    "the latter is well fit as a function of scale by @xmath220^{-2.3}$ ]",
    ". the filamentary alignment should be detectable in large galaxy cluster surveys such as sdss , but precise comparison between theory and observation will require a careful study of the connections between clusters observed in redshift / color space and the underlying halo population .",
    "the statistics presented here can be used to extend approximate methods for creating non - linear representations of the matter distribution based on the halo model description ( scocciamarro and sheth 2002 ) by incorporating an ensemble of ellipsoidal halos with correlated orientations and aligned position and velocity ellipsoids .",
