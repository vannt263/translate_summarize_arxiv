    "the first ` practical ' definition @xcite of a generating function @xmath5 , corresponding ( at least in principle ) to a realistic counting experiment , involved a spin - galvanometer as a measurement device ( see also ref . ) .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out @xcite that this suggestion ( corresponding rather to a ` gedanken experiment ' ) could actually be realized with qubits serving as a measuring device , whereby the ` environmental noise ' generated by the transmitted charge serves as the measurement signal for the full counting statistics .",
    "this contrasts with the usual interpretation of the ` environmental noise ' as being responsible for the qubit s dephasing @xcite expressed through the fidelity , and also relates to the competition between the gain of information and dephasing @xcite in quantum measurement theory .",
    "the insight on the equivalence between the notions of fidelity and full counting statistics has motivated a first - quantized formalism of the counting problem in terms of wave packets .",

    "moreover , our wave - packet formalism has technical merits ( e.g. , in the description of energy dependent scattering or in the classification of two - particle scattering events ) and also provides a better physical understanding .",
    "we remark , however , that in dealing with finite temperatures we make use of the second - quantized formalism in fock space .",
    "an alternative method , to the procedure based on a spin counter , was pursued in several contributions @xcite where the full counting statistics and , in particular , its generating function @xmath5 , was constructed using only basic quantum mechanical definitions ; starting with an initial state in the form of an eigenstate of the particle number operator with a fixed particle number to the right of the scatterer ( or the ` counter ' ) , a second projection ( to eigenstates of the number operator ) onto the final state is carried out after the observation time @xmath2 .",
    "both procedures , projection and spin - counting , lead to the same expressions for the generating function @xmath47 , provided that the incoming state involves no superposition across the scatterer . in the latter situation ,",
    "the explicit calculation using a spin - counter produces a fidelity describing the decoherence of the spin , while an interpretation in terms of a generating function can produce probabilities for noninteger charge transport @xcite and hence is unphysical . on the other hand , the projection method , destroying such a superposition in the course of the first measurement , always admits an interpretation in terms of probabilities .      in this paper",
