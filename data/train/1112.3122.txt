    "the large - scale spatial distribution of dark matter , as revealed from numerical simulations , shows a characteristic anisotropic web - like structure .",
    "this _ cosmic web _ , which arises through the gravitational clustering of matter , is mainly due to the effects of the tidal field : in fact , the competition between cosmic expansion , the trace , and the traceless part of the tidal field imprints anisotropies in the large - scale matter distribution in much the same way that gravity and radiation pressure imprints baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) sky ( hu & sugiyama 1995 ; lee & springel 2010 ) . hence , the initial shear field plays a crucial role in the formation of large scale structures , and a number of studies in the literature have been devoted to this subject  among the plethora of papers , see for example the classic works by zeldovich ( 1970 ) , icke ( 1973 ) , peebles ( 1980 ) , white ( 1984 ) , bardeen et al .",

    "in addition , if the cosmic web originates from primordial tidal effects and its degree of anisotropy increases with the evolution of the universe , then studying this initial field is crucial in understanding the subsequent nonlinear evolution of cosmic structures ( springel et al . 2005 ; shandarin et al .",
    "2006 ; desjacques 2008 ; desjacques & smith 2008 ; pogosyan et al . 2009 ) , the alignment of shape and angular momentum of halos ( west 1989 ; catelan et al . 2001",
    "; lee & springel 2010 ; rossi , sheth & tormen 2011 ) , the statistical properties of voids ( lee & park 2006 ; platen , van de weygaert & jones 2008 ) , and more generally for characterizing the geometry and morphology of the cosmic web ( shen et al .",

    "the basic theory for the formation and evolution of structures is now well - understood , thanks to the pioneering work of doroshkevich & zeldovich ( 1964 ) , doroshkevich ( 1970 ) , zeldovich ( 1970 ) , and sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1972 )  the latter in the context of galaxy formation .",
    "in particular , doroshkevich ( 1970 ) derived the joint probability distribution of an ordered set of eigenvalues in the tidal field matrix  at random positions  given the variance of the density field , corresponding to a gaussian potential ; we will refer to it as the _ unconditional _ probability distribution of eigenvalues .",
    "in addition , zeldovich ( 1970 ) provided the fundamental understanding of anisotropic collapse on cosmological scales , and recognized the key role of the large scale tidal force in shaping the cosmic web .",
    "subsequently , doroshkevich and shandarin ( 1978 ) calculated some statistical properties of the maxima of the largest eigenvalue of the shear tensor .",
    "their study proved that the most probable formation process starts first with a one - dimensional collapse ( cosmic pancake formation ) .",
    "the directions ( orientations ) for the one - dimensional collapsed sheets are determined by the largest eigenvalue of the deformation tensor , which can be attributed to the initial linear density perturbations ; moreover , the probability that two or even three of the initial eigenvalues are identical or nearly equal is extremely small , indicating that the collapse is triaxial .",
    "later on , following a constrained field approach pioneered by bertschinger ( 1987 ) , van de weygaert & bertschinger ( 1996 ) developed an algorithm for setting up tailor - made initial conditions for cosmological simulations , which addressed the role of the tidal fields in shaping large - scale structures .",
    "in the same period , bond , kofman & pogosyan ( 1996 ) developed a cosmic web theory which naturally explains the filamentary structure present in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology , due to the coherent nature of the primordial tidal field .",
    "they realized that an `` embryonic '' cosmic web is already present in the primordial density field , and explained why in overdense regions sheet - like membranes are only marginal features . since then ,",
    "because of the correspondence between structures in the evolved density field and local properties of the linear tidal field pointed out by the same authors , the statistics of the shear has received more attention in the literature .",
    "for example , lee & shandarin ( 1998 ) computed some probability distributions for individual shear eigenvalues and obtained an analytic approximation to the halo mass function , and catelan & porciani ( 2001 ) explored the two - point correlation of the tidal shear components .    however , a variety of studies in the physics of halo formation and cosmic web classification are based on doroshkevich s unconditional formulae for the ordered eigenvalues of the initial shear field associated with gaussian statistics ( doroshkevich 1970 ) , but those formulas can not differentiate between random positions and peak / dips as they neglect the fact that halos ( voids ) may correspond to maxima ( minima ) of the density field . according to bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , if one assumes the cosmological density fluctuations to be gaussian random fields , the local maxima of such fields are plausible sites for the formation of nonlinear structures . hence , the statistical properties of the peaks can be used to predict the abundances and clustering properties of objects of various types , and in studies of the non - spherical formation of large - scale structures .",
    "the study of bertschinger ( 1987 ) goes in this direction , by generalizing the treatment of bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and proposing a path integral method for sampling constrained gaussian random fields .",
    "the method allows one to study the density field around peaks or other constrained regions in the biased galaxy formation scenario , but unfortunately it is too elaborate and inefficient in its implementation .",
    "instead , by applying the prescription of hoffman & ribak ( 1991 ) to construct constrained random fields , van de weygaert & bertschinger ( 1996 ) were able to show that it is possible to generate efficiently initial gaussian random density and velocity fields , and specify the presence and characteristics of one or more peaks and dips at arbitrary locations  with the gravity and tidal fields at the site of the peaks having the required strength and orientation .",
    "some other studies on constrained initial conditions were also pursued by van haarlem & van de weygaert ( 1993 ) , and by van de weygaert & babul ( 1994 ) .",
    "the idea has been expanded in bond & myers ( 1996 ) , who presented a _",
    "peak - patch _ picture of structure formation as an accurate model of the dynamics of peaks in the density field .",
    "their approach goes further , as it involves the explicit formalism for identifying objects in a multiscale field ( i.e. it does not restrict to a single scale ) .",
    "the model is even more precise for void patches , the equivalent framework for studying voids ( sahni et al .",
    "1994 ; sheth & van de weygaert 2004 ; novikov , colombi & dore 2006 ; colberg et al .",
    "2008 ) . in general , density peaks define a well - behaved point - process which can account for the discrete nature of dark matter halos and galaxies , and on asymptotically large scales are linearly biased tracers of the dark matter field ( desjacques & sheth 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , it would be desirable to incorporate the peak ( or dip ) constraint in the statistical description of the initial shear field , in order to characterize more realistically the geometry and dynamics of the cosmic web .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to do so , by providing a set of analytic expressions which extend the work of doroshkevich ( 1970 ) and bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , and are akin in philosophy to that of van de weygaert & bertschinger ( 1996 ) .",
    "this is achieved by constraining the hessian of the displacement field ( the matrix of the second derivatives ) to be positive ( negative ) definite , which is the case in the vicinity of minima ( maxima ) of the source of the displacement field .",
    "the new _ conditional _ probability distributions derived in this study include the correlation between the potential and density fields through a reduced parameter @xmath0 , and naturally recover doroshkevich s ( 1970 ) _ unconditional _ formulae in the absence of correlation .",
    "hence , the main focus of this work is to derive explicitly the joint probability distribution of the eigenvalues of the shear field , given the fact that positions are peaks or dips in the corresponding density field  and not random locations . in this sense",
    "the field is termed _ constrained _",
    "( i.e. it has _ constrained _ eigenvalues , which are the result of looking only at peak / dip regions ) , and it is statistically described by a _",
    "conditional _ probability distribution . note that even though the formalism is essentially restricted to one scale , the formulae derived here are useful in a variety of applications  some of which will be discussed at the end of this paper .",
    "the layout is organized as follows .",
    "section [ new_formula ] provides the derivation of the new analytic expressions for the conditional distributions of eigenvalues of the initial shear field .",
    "in particular , section [ notation ] illustrates the basic notation adopted ; section [ joint_eigen_new ] contains the derivation of the joint distribution of eigenvalues in the peak / dip picture , while section [ bbks_connection ] shows the reverse conditional distribution function . as a direct application of the new formulae , section [ individual_eigenvalues ] presents the individual distributions of eigenvalues subjected to the extremum constraint , along with some other related conditional probabilities .",
    "this part extends previous work by lee & shandarin ( 1998 ) , which is briefly summarized in appendix [ lee_shandarin ] , and complements the study of van de weygaert & bertschinger ( 1996 ) .",
    "finally , section [ conclusion ] highlights the main results and discusses ongoing and future applications , which will be presented in forthcoming publications .",
    "in this section , i first introduce the basic notation adopted throughout the paper .",
    "i then derive the conditional joint distribution of eigenvalues of the tidal field , under the constraint that the hessian matrix of the source of the displacement is positive ( or negative ) definite",

    "applications to halos and voids will be also presented next , including implications for the skeleton of the cosmic web .",
    "the extension to non - gaussian fields , along the lines of lam et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , is a natural follow - up of this work and will be presented in a forthcoming publication as well . in the context of cosmic voids , other interesting uses of the new formulae ( [ doro_inter_extended ] ) , ( [ doro_eigen ] ) ,",
    "( [ bbks_inter_extended ] ) and ( [ bbks_eigen ] ) involve the monge - ampre - kantorovitch reconstruction procedure ",
    "see for example lavaux & wandelt ( 2010 )",
    ".    the analytic framework described here can be also useful in several observationally - oriented applications , and in particular for developing algorithms to find and classify structures in the cosmic web .",
    "for example , bond , strauss & cen ( 2010 ) presented an algorithm that uses the eigenvectors of the hessian matrix of the smoothed galaxy distribution to identify individual filamentary structures .",
    "they used the distribution of the hessian eigenvalues of the smoothed density field on a grid to study clumps , filaments and walls .",
    "other possibilities include a web classification based on the multiscale analysis of the hessian matrix of the density field ( aragon - calvo et al .",
    "2007 ) , the skeleton analysis ( novikov et al . 2006 ) , as well as a morphological ( zeldovich - based ) classification ( for instance klypin & shandarin 1983 ; forero - romero et al",
    "more generally , the fact that the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix can be used to discriminate different types of structure in a particle distribution is fundamental to a number of structure - finding algorithms ( forero - romero et al .",
    "2009 ) , shape - finders algorithms ( sahni et al .",
    "1998 ) , and structure reconstruction on the basis of tessellations ( schaap & van de weygaert 2000 ; romano - diaz & van de weygaert 2007 ) , etc .",
    "in addition , the classification of different environments should provide a framework for studying the environmental dependence of galaxy formation ( see for example blanton et al .",
    "to this end , recently park , kim and park ( 2010 ) extended the concept of galaxy environment to the gravitational potential and its functions  as the shear tensor .",
    "they studied how to accurately estimate the gravitational potential from an observational sample finite in volume , biased due to galaxy biasing , and subject to redshift space distortions , by inspecting the dependence of dark matter halo properties on environmental parameters ( i.e. local density , gravitational potential , ellipticity and prolateness of the shear tensor ) .",
    "it would be interesting to interpret their results with the theoretical formalism developed here , and ultimately to study the gravitational potential directly from a real dataset such as the sdss main galaxy sample within this framework .",
    "the formalism presented in this paper is restricted to one scale ( i.e. peaks and dips in the density field , as in bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) , but the extension to a multiscale _ peak - patch _ approach along the lines of bond & myers ( 1996 ) is duable and subject of ongoing work .",
    "this will allow to account for the role of the peculiar gravity field itself , an important aspect not considered here but discussed for example in van de weygaert & bertschinger ( 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , these authors introduced the peak constraints to describe the density field in the immediate surroundings of a peak , and then addressed the constraints on the gravitational potential perturbations ; in particular , they constrained the peculiar gravitational acceleration at the position of the peak itself , in addition to characterizing the tidal field around the peak . including all these effects in our formalism",
    "is ongoing effort .",
    "finally , the interesting and more complex question of the local expected density field alignment / orientation distribution as a function of the local field value ( or the other way around  see bond 1987 ; lee & pen 2002 ; porciani et al . 2002 ; lee 2011 ) can be addressed within this framework , and is left to future studies .",
    "i would like to thank ravi k. sheth especially for bringing to my attention the work of lee & shandarin ( 1998 ) , and changbom park for his always wise advices  along with numerous discussions .",
    "i would also like to thank the referee , rien van de weygaert , for his insightful report and useful suggestions  which have been all included in the paper .",
    "part of this work was carried out in june 2011 during the `` apctp - ieu focus program on cosmology and fundamental physics '' at postech in pohang ( korea ) , and completed during the `` cosmic web morphology and topology '' meeting at the nicolaus copernicus astronomical center in warsaw ( poland ) , on july 12 - 17 , 2011  where i had stimulating conversations with bernard jones and sergei shandarin .",
