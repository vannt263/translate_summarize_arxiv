    "black holes play an essential role in our approach to the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the history of quantum gravity is deeply intertwined with the problem of very high energy scattering .",
    "it has been conjectured that microscopic black holes may be formed in particle collisions at energies higher than the planck mass and with impact parameters smaller than a critical value @xcite .    in models with @xmath0 extra spatial dimensions , where the standard model particles are assumed to reside on a 3-dimensional brane while only gravitons are allowed to propagate into the bulk , the planck scale , which is the scale characterising quantum gravity , can be just beyond the electroweak scale @xcite . within such tev - scale gravity models ,",
    "the conjecture suggests that particle collisions at tev energies may result in the production of black holes of masses at this energy scale provided the colliding particles come close enough @xcite .    due to their small masses ,",
    "these microscopic black holes undergo decay processes rapidly .",
    "it is believed that these multi - dimensional black holes should hawking - radiate @xcite mainly into standard model particles on the brane rather than into the bulk @xcite .",
    "thus direct observations of such black hole events are possible .",
    "estimates show that , depending on the value of the higher - dimensional fundamental planck scale , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) may either turn into a black hole factory @xcite , where the black hole formation conjecture , the hawking radiation law and the existence of extra spatial dimensions can be verified experimentally , or be able to put constraints on the model parameters from non - observation .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that particle astrophysics experiments are complementary to collider searches for new physics beyond the standard model . in the case of black hole production in tev - scale gravity models ,",
    "one finds @xcite that depending on the fluxes of the ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos , cosmic ray facilities such as auger and neutrino telescopes like amanda and rice may have an opportunity to see the first sign or put constraints on black hole production parameters before lhc starts operating .",
    "icecube has even discovery potential beyond the lhc reach .    in section 2",
    "the general aspects of gravitational scattering at ultrahigh energies will be briefly reviewed .",
    "two scenarios of extra dimension models in which tev - scale gravity can be realised are outlined in section 3 .",
    "section 4 will be devoted to black hole production and evaporation in tev - scale gravity , with some remarks concerning the working hypothesis adopted . in section 5",
    "we illustrate search strategies at colliders , cosmic ray facilities and neutrino telescopes with the simplest , nevertheless representative example : production and observation via hawking radiation of the microscopic schwarzschild black holes in the large extra dimension scenario .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the current understanding of particle scattering at ultrahigh energies in conventional 4-dimensional theories @xcite . we shall present arguments why particle scattering at trans - planckian energies can be treated semiclassically and why one expects black hole formation for small enough impact parameters .",
    "we start by recalling the two crucial dimensionless parameters which characterise gravitational scattering but keep @xmath1 in this section . ]",
    "@xmath2 here , @xmath3 is newton s constant , @xmath4 is the center - of - mass energy , @xmath5 the impact parameter and @xmath6 the total angular momentum . the schwarzschild radius associated with a certain centre - of - mass energy ,",
    "@xmath7 is the length scale at which curvature effects become significant .",
    "other relevant length scales in ultrahigh energy scattering regime include the planck length @xmath8 , which signifies when quantum gravity effects become important , and the string length scale , @xmath9 it is the fundamental length scale when the problem is studied within the context of string theory .",
    "here @xmath10 is the regge slope and @xmath11 is the gauge coupling at the string scale .",
    "conventionally , it is of order @xmath12 . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we shall assume @xmath13 in this regime , the internal structure of the strings can be ignored and it is sufficient to employ low energy effective field theory .",
    "so one is indeed left with the two dimensionless parameters eq .",
    "( [ dimless - para ] ) characterising the collision .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ dimless - para ] ) is the gravitational equivalent of the fine - structure constant .",
    "the essential difference lies in its explicit energy dependence , which is characteristic for gravitational interactions since energy itself plays the role of gravitational charge .",
    "trans - planckian energy scattering is defined by @xmath15 with @xmath16 the planck mass . in this regime ,",
    "gravitational interactions dominate over other gauge interactions .",
    "the gravitational scattering process in this regime is semiclassical and calculable by non - perturbative approaches only .",
    "note however that the second crucial parameter @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ dimless - para ] ) can still be varied at will . while trans - planckian energy scattering is always a semiclassical process , very different physics",
    "is expected to emerge depending on the value of @xmath17 .    in the small scattering angle limit , @xmath18",
    "( @xmath19 is the lorentz - invariant momentum transfer ) , or , correspondingly , for large impact parameters @xmath20 , the gravitational scattering cross section has been calculated by various semiclassical approaches @xcite , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite by solving the klein - gordon equation for a particle encountering the gravitational shock wave generated by another a fast - moving particle @xcite , by employing the eikonal approximation @xcite for four - dimensional gravity @xcite and for string theory @xcite , or by describing quantum gravitational effects by means of a topological field theory @xcite .",
    "all calculations agree with the claim that the process is dominated by eikonalised single graviton exchange .    as for smaller impact parameters",
    "@xmath5 , it is conjectured that black hole formation should set in below a critical value of @xmath21 of order one @xcite",
    ". are there sufficient evidences for one to believe in this conjecture ?    in @xmath22dimensional anti - de sitter space",
    "it has already been shown that a 3dimensional black hole @xcite is inevitably created in head - on particle collisions above some energy threshold @xcite . in four - dimensions , penrose @xcite and death and payne @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) studied the collision of two black holes moving at nearly the speed of light , and showed that closed trapped surfaces can be formed for a range of impact parameters .",
    "this study is redone and extended to particle collisions in higher dimensions recently @xcite by following the same approach , namely by modelling the gravitational field of each incoming particle by a plane - fronted gravitational shock wave .",
    "also in this case , closed trapped surfaces were found .",
    "furthermore , results from numerical studies on gravitational collapse of rotating stars also show black hole formation below a critical angular momentum @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "one may consider this as another supporting argument .",
    "for further attempts to prove the black hole formation conjecture , see refs .",
    "within models with extra spatial dimensions , the scale characterising quantum gravity can actually be in the tev range .",
    "this puts the remote possibility of microscopic black hole production within phenomenological reach . in this section",
    "we shall shortly outline two possible constructions of tev - scale gravity models : the large compact extra dimension scenario @xcite and the warped scenario @xcite .",
    "( for a review of extra dimensions see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the large extra dimension scenario , it is assumed that gravitons are allowed to propagate freely into the bulk , while other standard model fields must be localised on a 3brane .",
    "the 4dimensional effective action describing long - distance gravity is then obtained by integrating the @xmath24dimensional gravitational action over the extra dimension coordinates , of which the metric is assumed to be independent @xmath25 therefore , @xmath26 relating the @xmath27-dimensional newton s constant to the fundamental planck scale @xmath28 , in the convention of @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy between the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath29 and the fundamental planck scale @xmath28 arises then from the large volume of the extra dimensions @xmath30 for a fundamental planck scale @xmath31 tev , sizes of the compact extra dimensions are required to be ( in the case that all extra dimensions are of the same order ) @xmath32 and can even be as large as @xmath33 , since this is the smallest distance ever probed directly so far .",
    "one sees also that @xmath34 is immediately ruled out by astronomical data , while for @xmath35 to 6 the compactification radii @xmath36 range from a sub - millimeter to a few fermi .",
    "warped scenarios provide an alternative approach to explain the hierarchy : the weak scale is generated from the planck mass through the `` warp factor '' , which is an exponential function of the compactification radius , arising not from gauge interactions but from the background metric .",
    "a simple explicit example of this mechanism is demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite with two 3-branes and one compact extra dimension , and with the standard model fields residing on the `` visible '' brane .",
    "the 3-branes , extending in the @xmath37 directions , are located at @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the fifth dimension .",
    "the effects of the branes on the bulk gravitational metric are taken into account , and are expressed by the `` vacuum energy '' terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the action @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the cosmological term and @xmath44 the planck scale in the five - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the solution to the five - dimensional einstein s equations is required to respect four - dimensional poincar@xmath45 invariance in the @xmath37 directions , and is found to be @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the single scale which fine - tunes between @xmath43 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the warp factor contained in the metric generates an exponential hierarchy between @xmath29 and the electroweak scale @xmath48 : @xmath49 to account for the observed 15 orders of magnitude between @xmath29 and tev physical mass scales , only @xmath50 need to be required .",
    "therefore , other than in the large extra dimension scenarios , the size of the extra dimension need not be much larger than the natural length scale @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , the largeness of the planck mass @xmath29 or the weakness of the gravity for an observer on the visible brane can be interpreted as due to the small overlap of the graviton wave functions in 5 dimensions with the visible brane .",
    "phenomenology of extra dimension scenarios includes deviation from newtonian gravity in distances smaller than the compactification radii , kaluza - klein graviton emission and exchange , and the possible production of microscopic black holes in trans - planckian energy scattering .",
    "lower limits on the fundamental planck scale @xmath28 in the large extra dimension scenario are derived from sub - millimeter tests of newton s law by cavendish - type experiments @xcite , from collider searches for graviton emission and exchange in scattering processes @xcite , as well as from astrophysical and cosmological considerations , such as the rate of supernova cooling and the diffuse @xmath52ray spectrum @xcite .",

    "but it is still not clear whether one can simply insert the kerr radius determined from @xmath94^     { \\frac{1}{\\delta + 1 } } = r_{\\rm s}\\ ] ] into the geometric cross section , eq .",

    "* it is proposed that in string theories , trans - planckian energy scattering should generally lead to the creation of higher - dimensional , non - perturbative gravitational objects ( @xmath96-branes ) , since spherically symmetric black holes are regarded as one particular class of them ( @xmath38-branes ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is found that in some cases , @xmath96-brane formation could be competitive with black hole production , and has important phenomenological consequences @xcite .      in general ,",
    "after its formation in high energy particle collisions , a black hole loses electric charge via the schwinger process @xcite and angular momentum via superradiance @xcite rapidly .",
    "these processes are accompanied by the hawking effect @xcite , which reduces the black hole mass and hence its surface area .",
    "as the black hole evaporates down to a mass of order of the planck scale , one must again appeal to the theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it is also for this reason still not clear what is left over after the decay of a black hole . within string theory , a black hole",

    "it then makes a transition to a `` string ball '' , as mentioned in section 4.1 .",
    "@xcite gives a detailed description of the string ball decay processes .",
    "but since a black hole spends most of its lifetime in the stage where its mass is close to the initial value , it is sufficient to adopt the following semiclassical approximation for the purpose of e.g. estimating black hole event rates and event signatures at colliders or at cosmic ray facilities , which will be illustrated in the next section . for investigations of black hole evaporation in extra dimensions ,",
    "see e.g. ref .",

    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the multi - dimensional black holes localised on the brane radiate at equal rates @xmath100 into a bulk field and into a brane field ( the stefan - boltzmann constant in @xmath101-dimensions @xmath102 is found to be almost independent of the number of extra dimensions @xmath103 ) .",
    "the fact that there are much more fields on the brane than in the bulk then leads to the conclusion that small black holes localised on the brane radiate mainly into standard model particles on the brane rather than into the bulk .",
    "this raises the possibility of examining the black hole formation conjecture in future high - energy experiments via the observation of hawking radiation , provided tev - scale gravity is realised in nature .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=491 ]    the ability to detect muons from distant neutrino reactions increases an underwater/-ice detector s effective neutrino target volume dramatically . with an effective area of about 0.3 km@xmath138 for down - going muons above 10@xmath144 gev and 5 years data available",
    ", amanda achieves an exposure of about @xmath145 . in the case",
    "that the neutrino flux is just at the level of the cosmogenic one , only a few @xmath146 through - going events from standard model background are expected per year .",
    "therefore , amanda should be able to impose strong constraints on the black hole production parameters if the currently available data show no through - going muons above 10@xmath144 gev .",
    "furthermore , if an ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux significantly higher than the cosmogenic one is realised in nautre , one even has discovery potential for black holes at icecube beyond the reach of lhc , though discrimination between standard model background and black hole events becomes crucial .",
    "for other quite similar investigations on the sensitivity of neutrino telescopes to black hole production , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "models with extra spatial dimensions and tev - scale gravity offer the first opportunity to test the conjecture of black hole formation in trans - planckian energy collisions and the prediction of black hole evaporation by near - future high energy experiments .",
    "the lhc will be producing microscopic black holes copiously if the fundamental planck scale @xmath28 is below 2 tev , while the reach of the cosmic ray facilities and neutrino telescopes depends on the unknown ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux .",
    "it is found that , already for a cosmic neutrino flux at the level expected from the cosmic ray primary interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation , the pierre auger observatory has an opportunity to see first signs of black hole production before the start of the lhc .",
    "the non - observation of horizontal air showers by the fly s eye and agasa experiments imposes a stringent bound on @xmath28 , which is competitive with existing bounds from colliders as well as from astrophysical and cosmogolical considerations .",
    "further sensible constraints on the black hole production parameters and/or bounds on low - scale gravity are expected from neutrino detectors amanda and rice , using already available data for through - going muons and contained events , respectively . moreover , in the optimistic case that an ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrino flux is significantly higher than the cosmogenic one , one even has discovery potential for black holes at the under - ice neutrino detector icecube beyond the reach of lhc .",
    "we have illustrated the search strategies at colliders , cosmic ray facilities and neutrino telescopes , and compared their reaches with the simplest , nevertheless representative example : production of schwarzschild black holes in large extra dimension scenarios .",
    "there still remains much work to be done .    on the theoretical side , before the full quantum theory of gravity is developed , one can still improve / extend the estimate of the black hole production cross section in @xmath82 dimensions semiclassically .",
    "other tasks not necessarily requiring the knowledge of quantum gravity include the construction of higher - dimensional black hole solutions with charges and angular momenta in different models , and evaluating the grey - body factor for the decay of the higher - dimensional black holes .    while the above theoretical refinements may not affect the expected black hole signatures very much , more simulations for various detectors need to be done , in order to develop successful tools to discriminate black hole events against standard model backgrounds .",
