    "there is a compelling evidence @xcite , mostly coming from astrophysical observations @xcite , for the existence of dark matter in the universe .",
    "many direct search experiments are testing the wimp ( weakly interactive massive particle ) hypothesis as dark matter candidate by measuring the energy transferred to target nuclei through the wimp - nucleus scattering .",
    "they look for an excess of events over the expected background or for annually modulated signals @xcite but they lead to controversial results : the annually modulated signal observed by dama / libra @xcite is in tension with upper limits on the interaction cross section reported by other experiments @xcite",
    ".    an unambiguous signature of wimps would come from the observation of a non - isotropic signal with respect to the isotropically distributed background : indeed , due to the relative motion of the solar system with respect to the galactic halo , the wimp flux should mostly come from the direction of this motion ( i.e. from the cygnus constellation ) and nuclear recoils induced by wimps should show a peak in the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "recoil tracks in solid targets are expected to be in the sub-@xmath1 m range and require an unprecedented spatial accuracy .",
    "therefore many efforts have been pursued exploiting low - pressure gas detectors , like drift @xcite , newage @xcite , dmtpc @xcite , mimac @xcite ; nevertheless these approaches require large target volumes in order to be sensitive to low wimp spin - independent interaction cross sections , and the small mass exposures performed so far are limited by non - trivial scalability problems .    a recent proposal @xcite foresees the use of nuclear emulsions both as target and as tracking device for a wimp directional search .",
    "nuclear emulsion consists of a large number of sensitive silver bromide crystals , usually with linear dimensions of about 200 nm , like the one used for opera films @xcite , dispersed in an organic gelatin matrix , composed essentially by hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "through - going ionizing particles release energy to the crystals creating sensitised sites along their trajectories , the latent image . by the action of a mild chemical reducing agent , a photographic developer , the conversion of halide to metallic silver selectively affects sensitised crystals .",
    "after the development , followed by fixing and washing , the gelatin becomes optically transparent .",
    "three - dimensional paths of charged particles are finally visible as trails of silver grains using optical microscopes .    the production of films with a crystal diameter of 40@xmath29 nm and a linear density of 11 crystals/@xmath1 m was achieved for the first time in 2007 @xcite .",
    "further upgrades @xcite have produced samples with a linear dimension of 18@xmath25 nm , one order of magnitude smaller than opera films @xcite ; their linear density is @xmath3  29  crystals/@xmath1 m , implying an intrinsic detector threshold of about 50 nm , if we consider tracks of at least two grains .",
    "this threshold corresponds to a recoil energy of carbon ( silver ) nuclei of about 20 kev ( 110 kev ) .",
    "radiogenic backgrounds have to be reduced and taken under control when dealing with signals as rare as the wimp - nucleon scattering .",
    "the energy deposition per unit path length of wimp - induced recoils is expected to be , for light and heavy nuclei respectively , one or two orders of magnitude larger than the one due to electrons @xcite ; therefore @xmath4-rays and @xmath5-particles can be rejected by properly controlling the emulsion response , in terms of number of sensitised crystals per unit path length ( _ sensitivity _ ) , through the chemical treatment of the emulsion itself .",
    "@xmath6-particles , essentially coming from uranium and thorium decay chains , have energies of the order of mev and can therefore be identified by their 3d range and rejected by an upper cut on the track length . for this purpose , a tomographic emulsion scanning with micrometric resolution , like the one performed in opera @xcite and able to reconstruct also perpendicular tracks , will be performed .",
    "the most important background is represented by neutrons since they induce nuclear recoils with track lengths comparable to the wimp - induced ones . for external sources we plan to inherit and adapt passive shielding strategies successfully implemented in other dark matter experiments and to operate the detector underground , for the reduction of the cosmogenic contribution .",
    "intrinsic contamination of nuclear emulsions by uranium and thorium traces is responsible for an irreducible neutron yield through ( @xmath6,n ) reactions and @xmath7u spontaneous fission .",
    "this neutron source is unavoidable and can be minimized only by a proper selection and/or pre - treatment of the emulsion components .",
    "the aim of this publication is to set the scale of this irreducible background contribution .    after a description of the constituents and of the elemental composition of nuclear emulsions",
    "we report the measurements of the intrinsic radioactive contamination .",
    "we then derive the related neutron yield and its energy spectrum .",
    "based on a geant4 @xcite simulation of nuclear emulsions , we estimate the intrinsic background induced by neutrons . we finally conclude that , even without a dedicated selection of the emulsion components , it is compatible with an emulsion exposure of @xmath8(10 ) kg  @xmath0  year .",
    "nuclear emulsions are composed by an organic gelatin matrix acting as retaining structure for their sensitive elements , the silver bromide crystals .",
    "the emulsions developed for directional dark matter searches consist of a larger fraction of agbr crystals with smaller dimension with respect to the standard ones ; crystals are also doped with iodine to increase their sensitivity to ionizing particles .",
    "it should be mentioned that the presence of iodine slightly enhance the detector sensitivity to spin - dependent wimp interactions .",
    "polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) is used to stabilise and reduce the crystal growth .",
    "agbr - i crystals are uniformly dispersed in a homogeneous mixture of gelatin and pva .",
    "the results reported hereafter are based on samples provided by the nitta gelatin ( cow s bones gelatin ) , the kanto - kagaku for agbr and the sigma - aldrich for the pva .",
    "the mass fractions of the emulsion constituents are reported in  [ tab : constituents ] , while in  [ tab : composition ] the elemental composition is detailed .",
    "the emulsion composition , key ingredient for the neutron yield estimation and for the geant4 simulation , has been carefully determined for light elements by an elemental analyser ( yanaco mt-6 ) ; their measurements were performed with a relative humidity ranging from 30% to 40% and have an absolute uncertainty of 0.003 .",
    "we have measured that a 10% variation in relative humidity induces changes in h and o mass fractions well within this uncertainty .",
    "the mass fraction of silver and bromine has been measured by an energy dispersive x - ray analysis with an absolute uncertainty of 0.02 .",
    "the density amounts to 3.43 g @xmath9 .",
    "a sample of each component of the nuclear emulsion has been analysed by the chemistry service in laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs , italy ) , with the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( icp - ms ) technique @xcite , in order to determine the uranium and thorium contamination ; the instrument used for the analysis is a 7500a model from agilent technologies and the results obtained have an uncertainty of 30% .",
    "the measured contaminations are reported in  [ tab : contamination ] for all the constituents , together with the corresponding activities obtained through the conversion factors 1 bq kg@xmath10 ( @xmath7u ) @xmath11 81@xmath010@xmath12 g g@xmath10 ( @xmath7u ) , 1 bq kg@xmath10 ( @xmath13th ) @xmath11 246@xmath010@xmath12 g g@xmath10 ( @xmath13th ) @xcite .",

    "the @xmath7u activity amounts to 23@xmath27  mbq  kg@xmath10 ( i.e.  ( 1.9@xmath20.6)@xmath010@xmath12 g g@xmath10 ) , while the @xmath13th one is 5.1@xmath21.5 mbq  kg@xmath10 ( i.e.  ( 1.3@xmath20.4)@xmath010@xmath12 g g@xmath10 ) .",
    "the reported errors are dominated by the 30% uncertainty in the radioactive contamination measurements . by assuming a null contribution from pva ,",
    "the previous contaminations are reduced by @xmath3 2% .    in nature",
    "uranium and thorium decay chains are found in secular equilibrium ; therefore , in order to calculate the neutron yield from ( @xmath6,n ) reactions , the same activity of the parent is assumed for all the daughter nuclides in the chain .",
    "nevertheless , the human intervention during the manufacturing process may alter the equilibrium by artificially modifying the quantity of some nuclides in the chain . in order to verify the validity of this assumption and also to cross",
    "check the measured activities , the samples were analysed with the @xmath4-spectroscopy technique sensitive to @xmath4-active daughter nuclides .",
    "the measurements have been performed in the low background facility stella ( subterranean low level assay ) of the lngs @xcite with germanium detectors ; a sample of about 300 g of agbr - i and one of about 500 g of gelatin were used and the data taking lasted for about 2 and 3 weeks respectively .    as reported in  [ tab : contamination_gamma ] , the results for the agbr - i are in fair agreement with the mass spectrometry measurement and there is no indication for broken decay chains . for the gelatin ,",
    "the measurements gave comparable results for the @xmath13th chain , while the @xmath4-spectroscopy measured a concentration of @xmath24ra in the @xmath7u chain about 20 times smaller than the parent isotope , with a measured value of 2.4@xmath20.6  mbq  kg@xmath10 .",
    "this measurement suggests a break in the secular equilibrium of the decay chain at this point .",
    "for the gelatin , secular equilibrium is assumed for the upper part of the @xmath7u chain , using the activity measured by mass spectrometry , while , for the lower part , nuclides will be considered in equilibrium with @xmath24ra and the activity measured with @xmath4-spectroscopy will be used .",
    "therefore the nuclear emulsion activity for nuclides of the @xmath24ra sub - chain , including also the activities of agbr - i and pva weighted by the corresponding mass fraction , is 15@xmath25  mbq  kg@xmath10 .",
    "the total emulsion activities derived in the previous section are essential to determine the intrinsic neutron yield ; indeed uranium and thorium decay chains are responsible of neutron generation from detector materials through spontaneous fission and ( @xmath6,n ) interactions .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     a further background suppression can be obtained by exploiting the directionality information : indeed , as previously stated , the signal produced by wimp - induced nuclear recoils is expected to have a directional signature .",
    "we assume that the surface of the nuclear emulsion will be placed in parallel to the sun direction in the galaxy , thanks to an equatorial telescope . in this reference frame , the longitudinal component of the scattering angle is dominant on average and its projection @xmath37 on the plane of the emulsion surface can be defined .",
    "a further reduction of @xmath3 36% of the neutron - induced background can be achieved with the cut @xmath38 , accounting for the insensitivity to the sense . under these assumptions ,",
    "the intrinsic neutron - induced background would be 0.06 @xmath39 0.11 per year per kilogram .",
    "an unambiguous proof of the existence of dark matter in the form of wimp particles would come from the directional observation of induced nuclear recoils .",
    "the use of nuclear emulsions both as target and as detector is promising .",
    "one of the most important background for such an experiment comes from proton and nuclear recoils induced by neutrons from the intrinsic radioactive contamination of nuclear emulsions .",
    "the trace activity of @xmath7u and @xmath13th radioactive chains have been determined by measuring each nuclear emulsion component by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( icp - ms ) : the total emulsion activity is 23  mbq  kg@xmath10 for the uranium chain and 5.1  mbq  kg@xmath10 for the thorium chain with an uncertainty of 30% .",
    "the @xmath4-spectroscopy analysis , performed in order to cross check the results of icp - ms and to verify the secular equilibrium of the radioactive chains , confirmed the results except for a lower activity of the @xmath24ra sub - chain of @xmath7u for gelatin .",
    "the measured radioactive contaminations have been used to calculate the neutron flux generated by spontaneous fission of @xmath7u and by ( @xmath6,n ) reactions with the emulsion elements : it amounts to 1.2@xmath20.4 neutrons per year per kilogram of nuclear emulsion and the energy spectrum has a mean value of about 2 mev .",
    "a geant4 simulation demonstrates that , under certain assumptions on the detector geometry and on the read - out strategy , the detectable neutron - induced background can be reduced down to 0.06 per year per kilogram .",
    "therefore the neutron - induced background due to the intrinsic radioactive contamination allows the design of an emulsion detector with an exposure of about 10 kg  @xmath0  year .",
    "a careful selection of the emulsion components and a better control of their production could further increase the radiopurity , thus extending the detector exposure .",
    "we warmly thank c. galbiati and p. mosteiro for useful discussions on the measurements performed and on the estimate of the neutron background .",
    "we are also indebted with v. kudryavtsev for helps with the sources code .",
