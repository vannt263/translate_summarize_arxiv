    "lattices of photonic resonators have recently emerged as versatile simulators of condensed matter physics phenomena  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the great flexibility and onsite control in their fabrication , photonic systems have opened a way to the investigation of phenomena otherwise difficult to access in conventional condensed matter systems . in particular , pioneered by the study of the bose - einstein condensation  @xcite , exciton polaritons have appeared as a very successful system in the research on quantum fluids of light  @xcite , demonstrating various manybody phenomena such as supefluidity  @xcite , josephson oscillations  @xcite , and the localisation in flat bands in suitably designed lattice geometries  @xcite .",
    "other photonic platforms , such as microwave cavities  @xcite , silicon resonators  @xcite , and arrays of coupled waveguides  @xcite made excellent progress in the observation of topologically protected edge states .",
    "since its discovery , graphene , with its characteristic linear dirac - like dispersion of electrons , has been the subject of intense study in solid - state physics  @xcite . along with these developments ,",
    "there have been several studies on the simulation of graphene physics using photonics .",
    "honeycomb lattice structures to simulate the physics of graphene have been realized in microwave cavities  @xcite , propagating waveguides  @xcite , and exciton - polariton microcavities  @xcite .",
    "an important difference between the solid - state ( electronic ) graphene and photonic graphene is that , apart from the carrier being fermionic or bosonic , photonic cavity systems are intrinsically dissipative and what is observed in experiments is typically the steady - state configuration resulting from the interplay of pump and losses  .    on the one hand , dissipation poses certain challenges upon simulating dynamical properties , such as transport phenomena , because photons can be lost during propagation .",
    "alternative and more sophisticated experimental schemes are therefore required to address dynamical properties of graphene with photonic simulators .",
    "on the other hand , the dissipative nature of photons can be an asset when comparing photonics to other kind of simulators .",
    "for example , in photonic resonators , dissipation takes place via the escape of photons out of the system , carrying with them the complete information of the photonic wavefunction .",
    "furthermore , the driven - dissipative nature of these systems has opened a way to explore entirely new physics such as the dissipative phase transitions  @xcite , the dissipative measurement of band topology  @xcite , and emergence of novel topologial states  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate how driven - dissipative photonic systems can be used to simulate the klein tunneling phenomenon , which is a characteristic transport phenomenon of graphene . in this effect",
    ", a particle with relativistic dispersion normally incident on a potential step perfectly transmits into the step independently of the step height .",
    "when the step is higher than the energy of the incident particle , the transmission into the step corresponds to a  particle - like \" state transforming into a  hole - like \" state .",
    "klein originally discussed such a phenomenon in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite , but an analogous phenomenon can also occur in graphene where electrons have a linear ( relativistic ) dispersion and obey a two - dimensional dirac - like equation  @xcite .",
    "klein tunneling in graphene has been experimentally observed through transport measurements where engineered @xmath0 junctions provide potential barriers  @xcite .",
    "however , the direct experimental realization of the klein tunneling in a step configuration , instead of a barrier , is missing .",
    "klein tunneling has also been discussed in the context of optical microcavities in the presence of spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , but the lossy nature of photons was not taken into account .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the klein tunneling can be directly observed also in a driven - dissipative model of photonic graphene based on a honeycomb - shaped array of coupled semiconductor microcavities . by taking advantage of the flexibility in designing the pump profile , transmission and reflection rates",
    "can be quantitatively evaluated from the steady - state profile of the light emitted by the lattice under a coherent monochromatic pump .",
    "the direct access to the real - space wavefunctions allows the observation of negative refraction .",
    "our work demonstrates that the finite linewidth associated to losses in photonic devices does not significantly affect the phenomenon of klein tunneling , but rather offers a useful means to experimentally simulate its microscopic details .",
    "while our discussion is focused to the specific case of polaritons in laterally patterned planar microcavities  @xcite , it straightforwardly extends to other related systems such as microwave  @xcite and superconductor resonators  @xcite .",
    "this work is the first step towards the study of klein tunneling , negative refraction , and veselago lensing in the presence of interactions , direclty accessible in exciton - polariton lattices  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the article is the following . in sec.[sec :",

    "similarly , if one wants to calculate the wavefunciton on b sublattice , one takes the second component . throughout this manuscript",
    ", we assume that the wannier functions are sharply localized at the lattice sites .",
    "our gauge choice for the spinor wavefunction in ( [ wavefo ] ) follows from our choice of the orientation of the honeycomb lattice and of the unit cell , where a b lattice site is displaced from an a lattice site by a distance @xmath8 in the @xmath20 direction .",

    "the transmittivity is exactly one independently of the potential step height , resulting in a perfect transmission without any backscattering .",
    "this peculiar tunneling effect where a particle transmits through a potential which is higher than its energy is called the klein tunneling , in analogy with the klein paradox for relativistic particles  @xcite . in the context of particles in a honeycomb lattice",
    "this phenomenon arises as a consequence of the pseudo - spin ( chirality ) conservation on both sides of the step  @xcite .    in the context of graphene physics",
    ", klein tunneling has been studied in the case of a finite - width barrier  @xcite , rather than a step , and an oscillatory behavior of the transmission rate was predicted and observed as one changes the incident angle  @xcite . in the following , we show that in photonic systems one can directly observe the klein tunneling for a single step , a situation closer to the original argument of klein , via the analysis of both the angle dependence and the step height dependence of the conductivity .",
    "we consider a photonic graphene , such as the one realized in  @xcite , in which photons have a finite lifetime . by pumping the system continuously ,",
    "a steady - state configuration of photons is reached , whose real- and momentum - space distributions can be experimentally measured by detecting the near - field and far - field emissions , respectively .",
    "we restrict to the linear regime in which photons do not interact .",
    "we consider a tight - binding hamiltonian in which the annihilation operators of photons at position @xmath19 in a and b sublattices are denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath19 takes only discrete values on lattice sites . under monochromatic coherent pumping ,",
    "the expectation values of the operators in the heisenberg representation , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , evolve according to the pump frequency @xmath44 as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a uniform loss for all sites at a rate @xmath54 .",
    "then , the steady - state configuration of the photon fields @xmath55 and @xmath56 is obtained by solving the following linear equations  @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the spatial amplitude profile of the pump field acting on a and b sublattices , respectively , and @xmath60 is the step height which is @xmath61 at @xmath3 and @xmath62 at @xmath4 .",
    "the vectors @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 connect the nearest neighbors of a honeybomc lattice .",
    "we now describe the pumping scheme which creates the steady - state configuration of photon fields acting as the incident wave for the klein tunneling .",
    "we consider the situation where the system is coherently pumped by a gaussian field with spatial profile described by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the center of the pump , @xmath68 is the central momentum , and @xmath69 is the spatial width of the pump .    in the steady - state configuration of photons in the absence of a step ,",
    "all states with energy @xmath44 and momentum covered by the pump can in principle be excited , but the weight of excitation of each state depends on the complex overlap between the a and b sublattice components in the spinor wavefunction  ( [ wavefo ] ) and the pump profile .",
    "the two sublattices can in fact interfere constructively or destructively with the pump depending on the momentum .    to better understand the interference effect between a and b sublattices , in fig .",
    "[ interf ] , we plot the momentum distribution of the steady - state photon fields in the absence of a step for the pumping field centered at three different dirac points @xmath70 and a detection window centered around the same dirac points . here",
    "we consider an ideal case of a large sample size ( @xmath71 unit cells ) and small loss @xmath72 , to better illustrate our principle ; we later discuss in sec.[sec : smaller ] the effect of having a small sample with larger loss to consider more realistic situations .",
    "the frequency of the pump beam is @xmath73 , which corresponds to the momentum @xmath74 measured from dirac points .",
    "figure  [ interf ] shows that , on iso - energy surfaces , the emission is concentrated around different angles @xmath13 for a pump located around different dirac points .",
    "this angle dependent emission pattern can be explained by the structure of the spinor wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ wavefo ] )  @xcite . to understand the pattern quantatively",
    ", it is convenient to regard the emission as a result of two separate processes ; ( i ) a given pump beam excites a particular mode , and ( ii ) the excited mode emits light . both processes have angle dependence , and the resulting emission pattern is the product of the two processes .",
    "the first process can be understood from the overlap between the pump beam localized around a dirac point , e.g. @xmath75 , and the spinor ( [ wavefo ] ) . from the spinor structure , we see that the mode at momentum @xmath11 and angle @xmath13 in the vicinity of the dirac ponit @xmath75 is excited with the strength of @xmath76 . to understand the second process ,",
    "let us assume that a mode at momentum @xmath11 around a dirac point @xmath75 is excited with a unit strength .",
    "then , if the detection is performed around the same dirac point @xmath75 , this mode emits light with the intensity of @xmath76 , which gives the structure factor for the emitted light . in the end , as a result of the two processes , the observed emitted intensity from the momentum @xmath11 for a pump located around @xmath75 is approximately @xmath77 . instead",
    "if the detection is performed around a different dirac point @xmath78 , the first process does not change if we use the same pump , but the second process gives the intensity of @xmath79 , and the observed emitted intensity is @xmath80 .",
    "below , we discuss how to exploit this angle dependence of the sublattice interference to selectively excite an incident beam which mainly propagates toward the potential step .    from the momentum distribution of the steady - state in the presence of a step ,",
    "we want to extract the information on the reflection coefficient @xmath81 and the transmission coefficient @xmath82 defined in eq .",
    "[ wavef ] .",
    "when doing this , one needs to keep in mind that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the coefficients in the sublattice basis .",
    "as one performs the fourier transform of both sublattices at , for example , @xmath6 , and takes the intensity of the momentum component corresponding to @xmath83 , one obtains a value proportional to @xmath84 , not just @xmath82 . note that although these expressions , derived from eq .",
    "[ wavef ] , are defined for a conservative system , they also apply to the case of weak and homogeneous losses in a sufficiently large lattice .    while the angle - dependence may have some utility to selectively focus on a specific range of momenta",
    ", one can avoid the angle - dependent factor by summing the momentum components of the emitted intensity around three adjacent dirac points @xmath75 , @xmath78 , and @xmath85 in fig .",
    "[ interf](a ) , or , equivalently , around three dirac points which are separated by @xmath86 in @xmath29 direction , which gives @xmath87 an analogous result holds for the reflection coefficient @xmath81 .",
    "we have assumed here that the wannier function is well - localized in space so that its fourier transform has the same weight for all momentum components .",
    "we are now ready to present our proposal to study klein tunneling in driven - dissipative systems . in the next two subsections",
    "we will discuss two possible schemes , based on respectively a spatially tightly focused pump beam and a spatially wide pump beam . in the former case , a @xmath28-selective detection is sufficient to reconstruct the full angle - dependence of klein tunneling using a single pump spot . in the latter case ,",
    "an incident beam with a well defined wavevector @xmath88 is excited , which allows to also visualize the negative refraction effect .    throughout this section ,",
    "we focus on a rather idealized case of a large lattice and a small loss rate .",
    "for all considered cases , we will show that the quantities extracted from the numerical simulation are in good agreement with the general theory of klein tunneling . in the next section ( sec.[sec : smaller ] ) , we shall see how this conclusion survives when more realistic parameters from actual experiments are used .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider a beam focused in space ( @xmath89 ) , and analyze tunneling with a step @xmath90 .",
    "we take the loss to be @xmath72 throughout this section .",
    "we use the dirac point @xmath91 to be the central momentum of the pump field and the pump frequency of @xmath73 , which corresponds to the momentum @xmath74 from the dirac point .",
    "we place the center of the pump @xmath67 to be in the middle bewteen the lower - left corner of the sample and the center of the edge of the step at @xmath5 . as one sees from fig .",
    "[ interf](b ) , the momentum distribution of the no - step configuration is strong in @xmath92 , thus pumping the field at @xmath4 mainly excites an incident beam that propagates towards the potential step .    in fig .",
    "[ subtracted](b - d ) , we plot a cut of the momentum distribution for a given @xmath93 as a function of @xmath94 , where @xmath11 is measured with respect to the three dirac points @xmath75 , @xmath78 , and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the momentum distribution of the @xmath4 region is plotted in solid ( blue ) lines , which contains the information of both the incident and reflected waves , and the momentum distribution of the @xmath6 region is plotted in dashed ( green ) lines , which represents only the transmitted wave . from ( [ wavef ] ) , in the case of no loss with a plane wave with a single wave vector as an incident wave , one expects that the momentum space signal would be two sharp peaks at @xmath4 , corresponding to the incident and reflected waves , and one sharp peak at @xmath6 , corresponding to the transmitted wave . in our system , as we see in fig .",
    "[ figideal](b - d ) , the peaks are broadened due to the loss , and also have some structures due to the presence of the sample edges .",
    "the different structures observed in fig .  [ subtracted](b - d ) can be understood in terms of the sublattice interference effect discussed also in the previous section .",
    "we observe that the incident wave ( @xmath92 component of the solid lines ) is well visible in fig .",
    "[ subtracted](b ) and ( d ) but is strongly suppressed in ( c ) .",
    "this is because , as seen from fig .",
    "[ interf](c ) , the emission at @xmath92 is small around @xmath78 .",
    "we also observe that the @xmath95 part of the signal of fig .",
    "[ subtracted](c ) is not a single peak but shows a visible modulation on top of the peak .",
    "this is because the pump beam generates weak excitations also in @xmath95 modes which travel backward and reflect at the edge of the sample , thus producing the interference effects .",
    "we estimate the reflection coefficient @xmath81 by integrating the @xmath95 part of the detected signal of @xmath4 region ( solid lines ) and summing over the three dirac points @xmath75 , @xmath78 , and @xmath85 , as explained in the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : cohpump ] .",
    "we note that this method generally overestimates the reflection because the @xmath95 component of the incident beam , although small due to the choice of our pump beam , is not excluded in the integral .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath82 can be estimated by integrating the signal of @xmath6 ( dashed lines ) . to find the reflection and transmission rates @xmath33 and @xmath34 from  ( [ randt ] ) , we also need to know @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the incident angle @xmath37 is given for a fixed value of @xmath28 , and the transmission angle is determined by finding the average value of the transmission signal in the momentum space , which we call @xmath96 , and then through the relation @xmath97 .    in fig .",
    "[ subtracted](a ) , we plot the transmission rate @xmath34 as a function of @xmath28 . the blue dots are calculated from the numerical simulation , and the line is the analytical prediction of eq .",
    "( [ randttheoryhole ] ) .",
    "we observe that the transmittivity is quite underestimated in the numerical simulation .",
    "this is because the signal at @xmath4 to estimate the reflection coefficient contains contributions from incident waves as well .",
    "the overestimation of the reflection wave is larger at @xmath98 than at @xmath99 because the incident wave , whose profile is similar to fig .",
    "[ interf](b ) , has more overlap with @xmath98 region than with @xmath99 region at @xmath95 thus overestimates the reflection at @xmath98 .",
    "one can improve the estimate by pumping around @xmath75 and detecting only around @xmath78 , taking advantage of the fact that the incident wave is very suppressed around @xmath78 as we discussed above . in order to calculate the transmittivity using signal only around @xmath78 , upon integrating the signal at @xmath4",
    ", one needs to take into account the angular factor due to the spinor structure correctly to estimate @xmath81 and @xmath82 , because there is no cancelation as in ( [ angularfactor ] ) .",
    "the transmittivity thus calculated is plotted as brown squares in fig .",
    "[ subtracted](a ) .",
    "we see an improvement in the estimate of the transmittivity .",
    "the advantage of this method is that one needs to only measure around one dirac point .",
    "finally , a very efficient but experimentally challenging , way to isolate the reflected wave in the @xmath100 region is to subtract the real - space field amplitude distribution without a step from the one with a step before performing the fourier transform ; the resulting momentum distribution is plotted in dotted ( red ) lines in fig .",
    "[ subtracted ] ( b - d ) .",
    "it shows a single peak at @xmath95 as we would expect for photons with nonzero @xmath28 component ; we recall that backscattering is only forbidden for exactly normal incidence onto the step .",
    "the transmission calculated using this procedure is displayed as red crosses in fig .",
    "[ subtracted](a ) , which shows a very good agreement with the theoretical prediction .      at this point , it is worth discussing the importance of the inter - valley scattering in our system .",
    "for the vertical step we consider ( see fig .",
    "[ honeycomb ] ) , the inter - valley scattering is kinematically not allowed due to the simple momentum and energy conservation .",
    "namely , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ interf](a ) , there is no state in the other valley conserving the energy and the momentum @xmath28 in the vertical direction . on the other hand ,",
    "if the step is aligned horizontally , there is a state in the other valley conserving the energy and the momentum @xmath94 in the horizontal direction .",
    "therefore , if we were to use a sharp horizontal step , we would have a non - negligible amount of the inter - valley scattering .",
    "such an inter - valley scattering would be suppressed if one uses not a sharp but a smooth step  @xcite .",
    "this orientation - dependence of the inter - valley scattering for a sharp step is confirmed by the numerical simulation as shown in fig .",
    "[ intervalley ] . in fig .",
    "[ intervalley](a , b ) , we plot the momentum - space distribution of the steady - state emission of photons of the reflected beam when the step is vertical . in order to isolate the reflection signal , we only look at @xmath4 part of the signal and we subtracted , as before , the steady - state photon amplitude without a step from that with a step .",
    "[ intervalley](a ) is the sum of the emission around the dirac points @xmath75 , @xmath78 , and @xmath85 , and fig .",
    "[ intervalley](b ) is the sum of the emission around the dirac points of the other valley .",
    "we see essentially no emission from the other valley . in fig .",
    "[ intervalley](c , d ) , we plot the case when the step is horizontal .",
    "[ intervalley](c ) is the sum around @xmath75 , @xmath78 , and @xmath85 , and fig .",
    "[ intervalley](d ) is the sum around the dirac points of the other valley .",
    "we see that the emission around the other valley is now significant .",
    "thus , the vertical orientation of the step we use in this paper is ideal for studying the klein tunneling without inter - valley scattering .",
    "we note that the absence of the reflected signal around @xmath101 for fig .",
    "[ intervalley](a ) and around @xmath102 for fig .",
    "[ intervalley](c ) is the manifestation of the perfect transmission for the normal incidence in the klein tunneling .    in reality , if we use a finite - size system , the inter - valley scattering can also occur at the top and bottom edges , which are oriented horizontally . in the following analysis ,",
    "the scattering at the edges is not siginificant for the large system size we use in sec .",
    "[ sec : schemes ] .",
    "however , for small systems in sec .",
    "[ sec : smaller ] , the scattering at the edges is one of the major sources of discrepancy from the numerical simulation and the analytical prediction of the klein tunneling .      we now proceed with the discussion of an alternative method to study klein tunneling effects which is also able to elucidate the negative refraction effect .",
    "the pump field is taken to have a wide gaussian profile in real space with @xmath103 and a momentum distribution well localized around the central momentum @xmath104 with @xmath74 .",
    "the pump frequency is set to @xmath73 on resonance with the dirac dispersion at the central momentum of the pump .    in fig .",
    "[ typical](a ) and ( b ) , we plot the steady - state field profile in real and momentum spaces in the absence of a step .",
    "one can see that photons propagate in real space at an angle of @xmath105 and the incident beam is well localized in momentum space . in fig .",
    "[ typical](c ) , we plot the steady - state spatial configuration of photons in the presence of a step with @xmath106 , where one sees the existence of the reflection and the transmission .",
    "the transmission through the step is directed downward , which shows the negative refraction characteristic of the klein tunneling in graphene for a hole - like transmission when the potential step is higher than the incident energy  @xcite .",
    "the usual refraction is recovered in the opposite case of a potential step lower than the incident energy ( not shown ) .    to better visualize the reflected and transmitted fields , in fig .",
    "[ typical](d ) we show the field amplitude after subtracting in the @xmath100 region the one for the no barrier case [ fig .",
    "[ typical](a ) ] .",
    "another salient feature we observe from fig .  [ typical](d ) is that the centers of the reflected and transmitted waves at the step edge are shifted .",
    "this is an analogue of the goos - hnchen effect known for total internal reflection in optical systems  @xcite .",
    "however , the value of the shift obtained in the numerical simulations does not fit the conventional theory of goos - hnchen effect in solid - state or photonic graphene  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a more elaborate theory taking into account pump and loss is necessary and will be the subject of future work .      the use of an incident beam localised in momentum provides a convenient method to study the angular dependence of the klein tunneling effect . to perform this study",

    "we analyze the reflection and transmission waves by looking at the momentum distribution as a function of @xmath94 for a fixed @xmath109 .    in fig .  [",
    "figideal](a ) , we show the normal incidence ( @xmath45 ) case .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the fourier transform in the @xmath4 and @xmath6 regions , respectively . as we expect from the theory of klein tunneling , there is only one peak in the fourier transform of @xmath4 corresponding to the incident wave , and no peak from reflection is present .    on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ figideal](b ) , we plot the momentum distribution for a finite incidence angle @xmath110 . in this case , the signal of the incoming wave and that of the reflected wave show themselves as two separate peaks in momentum space ; the larger ( right ) peak corresponds to the incoming wave , and the smaller ( left ) peak corresponds to the reflected wave .    to estimate the reflection coefficient @xmath81 , we integrate , as before , the reflection signal at @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , we estimate the transmission coefficient @xmath82 by integrating the transmission signal . in fig .",
    "[ figideal](c ) , we plot the angle dependence of the transmission rate thus obtained .",
    "the solid curve is the theoretical prediction from eq .",
    "( [ randttheoryhole ] ) .",
    "although the qualitative agreement is generally good , there is an overestimation of transmission especially at the region beyond the critical angle @xmath111 where theory would predict no transmission .",
    "the observed discrepancy for angles bigger than @xmath111 is due to the exponentially decaying evanescent wave that is present at @xmath10 even when there can be no transmitted propagating wave . on the other hand ,",
    "the well - localized momentum distribution makes the estimation of @xmath81 very accurate . as a result ,",
    "the transmission below the critical angle is very well estimated by the numerical simulation .",
    "next , we consider the case where the angle of the incoming wave is fixed to @xmath112 , but the height of the step varies .",
    "we assume that the pump beam is peaked around the momentum @xmath113 with @xmath74 , and the spatial width @xmath107 and frequency @xmath73 .",
    "we vary the height of the step so that the ratio of the step height to the energy of the pump ( @xmath114 ) varies from @xmath115 to @xmath116 .    in fig .",
    "[ figideal](d ) we plot the transmission rate @xmath34 as a function of @xmath114 . the analytical theory ( solid line )",
    "predicts a characteristic region of forbidden transmission at @xmath117 . below this region ( @xmath118 ) , the transmission is particle - like , and above this region ( @xmath119 ) , the transmission is hole - like  @xcite .",
    "this pronounced dip is quantitatively well reproduced by the numerical simulation ( dots ) .",
    "so far we focused on a rather large system with a small loss to demonstrate the principle of klein tunneling in photonic systems .",
    "now we consider more reasonable experimental parameters from  @xcite : a lattice of @xmath120 unit cells with @xmath121 .",
    "in such a small lattice , pumping with a spatially focused beam , as done in sec .",
    "[ spfb ] , is not a convenient technique .",
    "indeed , the small spot in real space results in non - negligible effects from pumping @xmath95 components ; @xmath95 components of the pump beam are reflected by the sample edge located at @xmath4 giving rise to an interference with both the pump beam and the signal reflected from the potential step .",
    "this multiple interference prevents a clear analysis of the klein signal .",
    "therefore we focus on pumping scheme with a spatially wide beam . however , a difficulty in dealing with a small sample is that one can not use a pump field too sharply localized in momentum space due to the limitation in the available space in the sample .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the larger losses giving rise to a shorter propagation distance , they also lead to a wider range of states being excited over an energy range of @xmath54 around the pump frequency .",
    "one way to tackle these difficulties is to use a larger value of @xmath44 to increase the relevant photon momentum , so that the momentum - space peaks can be more clearly resolved .",
    "an upper bound to the allowed @xmath44 is set by the size of the linear dispersion regime around the dirac point .    in fig .",
    "[ figreal](a ) , we plot the momentum distribution of normally incident beam ( @xmath45 ) using a pump with central momentum @xmath122 and @xmath123 , with @xmath124 corresponding to @xmath125 , in a spot located halfway between the lower - left corner of the sample and the center of the edge of the step at @xmath5 as before .",
    "we take the step height to be @xmath126 . comparing with fig .",
    "[ figideal](a ) , one can see that the momentum peaks are broader , reflecting the larger loss @xmath54 and the smaller value of @xmath69 .    in fig .",
    "[ figreal](b ) , we plot the momentum distribution for @xmath110 ; the reflected signal is visible and the transmitted signal is smaller compared to the normal incidence case of fig .  [ figreal](a ) .",
    "this trend is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ figreal](c ) , where we plot the transmission spectrum as a function of the angle of incidence for a fixed @xmath126 , showing a clear decrease of the transmission rate as the angle is increased . here",
    ", we are again estimating the reflection by integrating the whole signal at @xmath95 of @xmath4 region , which suffers from the broadened large incident peak centered at @xmath92 .",
    "another difficulty of having a small sample size is the unwanted reflection at the edges of the sample .",
    "in particular , the reflection at the top and the bottom edges of the system , which are aligned horizontally , can cause significant inter - valley scatterings , which can result in the further deviation of the numerical simulation from the klein tunneling theory .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ figreal](d ) , we plot the transmission as a function of the step height @xmath114 for a fixed incident angle of @xmath127 . in spite of a significant smoothening of the dip , the overall typical features of klein tunneling are still well visible .",
    "summing up , the results of fig .",
    "[ figreal ] confirm the actual observability of the main qualitative signatures of klein tunneling in models of photonic graphene with realistic parameters .",
    "these results should provide a clear guideline to undertake the experiment with state - of - the - art samples .",
    "we have shown that the klein tunneling and negative refraction effects can be observed in driven - dissipative photonic systems with experimentally realistic parameters . in particular , we have proposed a concrete experimental scheme to extract the transmittivity in driven - dissipative photonic systems . our result can be not only useful in confirming known condensed matter theories which are difficult to directly observe in electronic systems , but can also open the way to new phenomena that are unique in photonic systems .",
    "firstly , the structure of the spinor wavefunction is clearly visible through the interference effect in the momentum space emission of photons . by choosing the relative phase of the sublattices via the wavevector of the external pump field ,",
    "one is able to better isolate the physics of interest and possibly explore new subtle features of sublattice - dependent physics .",
    "secondly , an even more exciting direction of future research will consist of including optical nonlinearities characteristic of the polariton microcavities modeled in the present work .",
    "this would allow taking klein tunneling , and also other effects characteristic of spinor nature of the wavefunction , to the nonlinear regime .",
