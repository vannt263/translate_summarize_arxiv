    "however , spectra of these systems possess time - variable , redshifted atomic gas features which are believed to be generated by the evaporation of infalling comets ( vidal - madjar et al . 1994 ; roberge et al . 2002 ) .",

    "although @xmath0 her possess time - variable , velocity - shifted absorption features similar to @xmath4 pic , the high stellar luminosity and binary nature of the system may result in a different fate for gas liberated around @xmath0 her compared with material liberated around @xmath4 pic .",
    "our data were obtained on 2001 july 15 using the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) .",
    "our observations were made in histogram mode , using the low resolution 30@xmath12 @xmath5 30@xmath12 aperture which covers the wavelength range between 905 and 1187  .",
    "the _ fuse _ satellite has four channels ( lif 1 , sic 1 , lif 2 , sic 2 ) which form two nearly identical `` sides '' ( labeled 1 and 2 ) and each consist of a lif grating , a sic grating and , a detector . each detector is divided into two independent segments ( a and b ) , seperated by a small gap .",
    "the eight partially overlapping spectra that fall on different portions of the two detectors ( lif 1a , lif 1b , etc . ) cover the entire wavelength range .",

    "the offsets for the remaining channels analyzed ( lif 2b , sic 1a , sic 2b ) are calculated by cross correlating these spectra with spectra from the lif 1a channel in the wavelength regions in which they overlapped . the uncertainty in the relative wavelength calibration",
    "is dominated by detector distortions and is @xmath39 km / sec .",
    "no circumstellar lines were detected at wavelengths within the sic 2a/1b channels ( 905 to 1005  ) ; thus , these channels are not discussed further in this paper .",
    "all of our lif 2a channel exposures of @xmath0 her suffer from an effect called detector x - walk , in which low pulse height events are misplaced in the dispersion direction because of gain sag in the regions on the detector on which the brightest airglow lines fall .",
    "currently , there is no correction for detector x - walk in the histogram data calibration pipeline ; thus , we excluded all lif 2a spectra from our analysis .",

    "since these lines are significantly narrower than the rotationally broadened stellar lines and broader than the observed interstellar lines , shown for comparison in figures 1c and 1a respectively , the gases are circumstellar . no circumstellar is detected toward @xmath0 her .",
    "we fit a model to each multiplet using a quadratic polynomial plus a gaussian to represent the photospheric component and gaussians to represent each of the narrow circumstellar components .",
    "we initially fit the model by hand , masking out the narrow circumstellar lines and fitting the broad photospheric component and adding each circumstellar component back individually .",
    "then , we ran a minimize @xmath29 routine on the model using our initial fit as a starting point . in each model fit",
    ", we let the wavelength , scale , and fwhm for each gaussian be free parameters in addition to the 3 coeffecients for the quadratic polynomial .",
    "the model fits for the and features are overlaid on the spectra shown in figures 1a and 1b and have @xmath29 = 0.77 and 0.91 respectively . changing the wavelength of the circumstellar features by 10 km / sec and 20 km / sec increases the reduced @xmath29 of the fit to @xmath31.5 and @xmath32.5 respectively for and to @xmath31.4 and @xmath32.4 respectively for .",

    "the line equivalent widths and their statistical uncertainities are given in table 2 .",
    "the population of all observed species in excited fine structure levels can be explained with radiative pumping by stellar ultraviolet photons .",
    "we observed no absorption in the h@xmath15 lyman ( 5,0 ) band or the co c - x ( 0,0 ) band toward this star .",

    "we hypothesize that the circumstellar gas detected around @xmath0 her is physically associated with with the dust in ways described below .    since @xmath0 her is a b9v star , radiation pressure will effectively remove small grains from the environment around the star . a lower limit to the size of dust grains orbiting a star can be found by balancing the force due to radiation pressure with the force due to gravity . for small grains with radius @xmath37 ,",
    "the force due to radiation pressure overcomes gravity for : @xmath38 ( artymowicz 1988 ) where @xmath39 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath40 is the binary mass , @xmath41 is the radiation pressure coupling coefficient , and @xmath42 is the density of an individual grain . since radiation from a late b - type star is dominated by optical and ultraviolet light , we expect that @xmath43 and therefore the effective cross section of the grains can be approximated by their geometric cross section so @xmath44 .",
    "we estimate the stellar luminosity from the bolometric magnitude using the _ hipparcos _ v - band magnitude ( @xmath45 = 4.01 mag ) , correcting for the interstellar extinction measured along the line of sight ( e(b - v)=0.06 ; fajardo - acosta et al .",
    "1998 ) using the far ultraviolet extinction law derived in cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , a distance 93 pc , and a bolometric correction ( flower 1996 ) corresponding to an effective temperature @xmath26 = 10,500 k. for the primary , we estimate a stellar luminosity @xmath39 = 230 @xmath46 .",
    "we similarly estimate the luminosity for the secondary assuming a relative magnitude @xmath47 = 2.5 mag and a bolometric correction corresponding to an effective temperature of @xmath26 = 9530 k. for the secondary , we find @xmath39 = 7.4 @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the contribution of the secondary to the total luminosity of the system is small and can be neglected .",

    ". grains smaller than 15 @xmath10 m will be effectively removed by radiation pressure on a timescale of @xmath2010 years .",
    "another mechanism which may remove particles from the circumstellar environment is poynting - robertson drag . the poynting - robertson lifetime of grains in a circular orbit , a distance @xmath50 from a star is @xmath51 ( burns et al .",

    "it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the true mass in parent bodies .",
    "since @xmath0 her has an age of @xmath3140 myr , objects with a radius larger than 4.5 cm will not have had enough time to spiral into the star under poynting - robertson drag .",
    "large masses of circumstellar dust could exist around @xmath0 her and be difficult to detect at mid infrared wavelengths because large grains have relatively less surface area compared to their mass .",
    "we can estimate a lower limit for the total mass contained in parent bodies around @xmath0 her assuming that the system is in a steady state .",
