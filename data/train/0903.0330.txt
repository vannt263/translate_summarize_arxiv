    "model fits to the sdss spectra find that the majority of these objects are hydrogen ( da ) wds for which the mass distribution peaks at the expected value of @xmath9 m@xmath2 years ; see @xcite . ] .",
    "but among the new sdss wds there are also a handful of candidate very low - mass wds ( lmwds ) with m @xmath1 m@xmath2 .",
    "such objects are noteworthy not only because of their rarity but because the galaxy is not thought to be old enough to produce lmwds through single star evolution .",
    "the youngest wds in the oldest milky way globular clusters have masses of @xmath10  m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "lower mass wds must therefore undergo significant mass loss , presumably because they form in close binaries whose evolution includes a phase of mass transfer . during this phase ,",
    "much of the wd progenitor s envelope is removed , stunting the wd s evolution by preventing a helium flash in its core and resulting in the observed low - mass , helium - core wd  m@xmath2 is @xmath11 and rises to @xmath12 for m @xmath13  m@xmath2 .",
    "thus , even in this scenario , the likelihood of finding companions to the sdss lmwds remains high . ] . as @xcite put it ,",
    "`` low - mass wds need friends . '' in examining seven wds with m  @xmath14  m@xmath2 , they found that four are in double - degenerate close binary systems , with orbital periods on the order of a few hours to a few days ; for a fifth they identified a companion but were unable to confirm its nature or obtain an orbital period .",
    "subsequent studies of large samples of das found that roughly @xmath15 have masses @xmath16  m@xmath17 , and that in the majority of these binaries the companion is likely to be a degenerate star @xcite .",
    "the @xcite systems are wd / wd binaries , but the lmwd companions can also be neutron stars ( nss ; cf .  discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these systems ,",
    "binary evolution produces a lmwd in a near - circular orbit around the ns `` reborn '' as a millisecond pulsar ( msp ; for discussion of different evolutionary scenarios involving nss , see * ? ? ?",

    "most of these pulsars are msps , and in most cases their companions are thought to be lmwds with @xmath19  m @xmath16 m@xmath2 . of the @xmath20 msp companions identified outside of globular clusters , @xcite list @xmath21 with masses @xmath22  m@xmath2 , assuming the systems have a median inclination of @xmath23",
    ". however , the msp companions are frequently too faint for optical spectroscopy to confirm that they are lmwds . despite the observational challenges ,",
    "there are several well known msp / lmwd systems , and in fact the majority of known he - core wds are msp companions @xcite ; see @xcite for a review of these systems .",
    "that said , the birthrate of msps in the galactic disk is thought to be @xmath24yr@xmath25 @xcite . estimating the number of lmwds in the galaxy is difficult ( cf",
    ".  discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the sdss sample is best considered as providing a lower limit ( because wds are generally not explicitly targeted for sdss spectroscopy , it is unclear how best to correct for e.g. , incompleteness ) .",
    "however , @xcite used the palomar green survey to estimate the formation rate of lmwds to be @xmath26 pc@xmath27 yr@xmath25 , implying that these make up about @xmath15 of all da white dwarfs larger than indicated by the relative space densities of low - mass and ordinary ( @xmath9 m@xmath17 ) wds as it accounts for the presence of degenerate companions to the lmwds . ] .",
    "naively , this suggests that the lmwd birthrate in the volume sampled by the sdss dr4 ( @xmath28 kpc@xmath29 ) is @xmath30 yr@xmath25 , or nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of msps .",
    "this discrepancy in the ( admittedly very rough ) birthrates suggests that there is a low likelihood of detecting msp companions to sdss lmwds .    still , because of the tantalizing theoretical and observational connections between lmwds and msps , we searched for radio pulsations from putative pulsar companions to @xmath0 spectroscopically confirmed sdss lmwds using the nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",

    "we use the models in figure  [ properties ] to estimate m@xmath136 for each of our lmwds ; their properties are presented in table  [ props ] . while the masses of these wds are comparable to those of lmwds detected as msp companions , their temperatures are very different .",

    "these ages are calculated from wd cooling models , and correspond to the time since the end of mass transfer onto the wd companions . by contrast , typical msps have ages of @xmath146 to @xmath147 gyr ; these are estimated from the pulsar characteristic ( spin - down ) age and , in a few cases , also from the companion wd s cooling age ( e.g. , j1012@xmath315307 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lmwds were observed with the gbt over the course of five nights between 2006 january 12 and march 9 .",
    "each session began with a 1 min observation of a test pulsar that was immediately analyzed to confirm a correct observing setup ; the integration times for each target are listed in table  [ props ] . at the central observing frequency of 820mhz , the berkeley - caltech pulsar machine analog / digital filter bank ( the design is described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provided 48mhz of bandwidth split into 96 spectral channels , for each of which we recorded total power samples every @xmath148s .",
    "the resulting data were analyzed using standard pulsar search techniques implemented in the presto package @xcite installed in our computer cluster .",
    "this analysis was similar to that described in @xcite , with appropriate ranges of trial dispersion measure ( dm ) to account for dispersive interstellar propagation , and with substantial acceleration correction to partially account for the changing pulsar period caused by putative orbital motion .",
    "we calculated the maximum dm expected in the direction of each target using the @xcite model for the distribution of free electrons in the galaxy .",
    "a typical value for our high - galactic - latitude targets was @xmath149cm@xmath27pc . in order to account for possible uncertainties in the model , we de - dispersed the data up to a dm limit twice that obtained from the model .",
    "these values are given for each target in table  [ props ] .",

    "this significantly increases the parameter space that needs to be searched for pulsed signals and hence the computing time on the cluster , and also impacts our sensitivity limits ( see discussion in   [ acc_sens ] ) .",
    "no convincing pulsar signal was detected in our data . below we discuss the limitations of our search .",
    "models for wds in the mass range of interest here predict absolute magnitudes of m@xmath157 @xcite .",
    "we use sdss data release 6 photometry ( dr6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to obtain rough distance estimates to our lmwds ( see table  [ props ] ) .    luminosity - wise , our searches were extremely constraining . in order to calculate the minimum detectable period - averaged flux density , we use the standard modifications to the radiometer equation .",
    "we consider a pulsar duty cycle of 20% ( fairly typical of msps ) and compute sensitivity , conservatively , for @xmath158cm@xmath27pc . at 820mhz ,",
    "the gbt gain is 2kjy@xmath25 and the system temperature is 25k .",
    "the sky temperature varies with location , but at the relevant high latitudes at this frequency it only adds a few kelvin to the overall temperature .",
    "we consider an effective threshold signal - to - noise ratio of 10 .",
    "for an integration time of 2400s ( see table  [ props ] ) , the sensitivity limit for long period pulsars is 0.16mjy .",
    "pulsar luminosities are often measured at 1400mhz ; using a typical spectral index of @xmath159 , the limiting sensitivity at that frequency is about @xmath160mjy . for an msp period of 3ms ,",
    "our sensitivity at 1400mhz was roughly 50% worse , or 0.1mjy ( and it quickly degrades for shorter periods , being three times worse for 1ms ) .",
    "( twelve of our targets fall within the first footprint ; none are detected in these data , for which the sensitivity limit is roughly @xmath145 mjy @xcite . )",
    "about 95% of msps known in the galactic disk have luminosities @xmath161mjykpc@xmath162 , and some @xmath152 have @xmath163mjykpc@xmath162 .",
    "since our targets have typical estimated distances of @xmath164 kpc , our @xmath165 limits for 3ms periods ranged over @xmath166 mjykpc@xmath162 . as far as luminosity alone is concerned , therefore , we should have been able to detect approximately @xmath152 of known msps had they been present in our targets and beaming radio waves toward the earth .",
    "as mentioned earlier , if the lowest - mass wds in our sample are in binaries with nss , these should be compact systems with orbital periods on the order of a few hours to a few days @xcite . as a result ,",
    "pulse smearing due to orbital motions could occur , severely complicating our search . to gauge the extent of this effect",
    ", we have calculated orbital accelerations for a number of systems with lmwds in orbit around a @xmath97  m@xmath2 ns .",
    "when conducting an accelerated pulsar search with presto , the free parameter related to the maximum acceleration searched actually specifies the maximum drift of fourier components that is corrected . relating this to a physical acceleration depends on the integration time and on the putative pulsar period .",
    "we consider a period of 3ms . for our integration times and computing resources , it was impracticable to fully correct for putative acceleration such as",
    "might be produced in systems with orbital periods of about 8 hours or less .",
    "for example , for j0849@xmath310445 , a m  @xmath47  m@xmath2 wd that we observed for @xmath52 s , the search sensitivity to a @xmath167 ms pulsar was limited to a maximum acceleration of @xmath168  m  s@xmath154 . because this search alone required several days of computing time on our @xmath169-node cluster , it simply was not feasible to extend it to the maximum accelerations predicted for a wd of its mass ( e.g. , @xmath170  m  s@xmath154 if @xmath171 h and @xmath172  m  s@xmath154 if @xmath173 h ) .",
    "furthermore , for the six wds with m  @xmath174  m@xmath2 , our integration times may represent a substantial fraction of the binary orbital period ( e.g. , as much as @xmath11 in the case of sdss j1234 ; see table  [ props ] ) . in these cases ,",
    "the assumption of a constant apparent acceleration used in our search breaks down , further limiting our ability to detect a pulsed signal from these targets .    nevertheless ,",
    "we were still very sensitive to most kinds of _ known _ msp / wd systems : essentially none are known in the disk of the galaxy with @xmath175h . in summary , while we were not very sensitive to new kinds of exotic msps ( e.g. , with @xmath176ms , or with @xmath177h ) , we should have detected some ordinary msps if they were orbiting a substantial fraction of our targets .",
    "@xcite conducted a similar search for radio pulsations at @xmath4 mhz from unseen companions to eight sdss lmwds using the gbt .",
    "none of these observations contained signals warranting follow - up .",
    "the eight wds targeted by @xcite , described in @xcite , were identified as candidate lmwds based on initial model fits to sdss spectra done by @xcite . however , of the eight candidates , three are no longer considered lmwds based on more recent analysis of their spectra by @xcite461156.4 , j102228.02@xmath31020035 , and j130422.65@xmath31012214.2 . ] .",
    "we therefore updated the analysis performed by @xcite in order to place more stringent constraints on the likelihood @xmath5 that a given lmwd has an msp companion .",
    "@xcite assumed that a non - detection was the most likely outcome of their observations and estimated @xmath5 by using @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the msp beaming fraction , @xmath180 is the luminosity completeness of the search , @xmath181 the sensitivity to the systems accelerations , @xmath182 the search - algorithm success rate , and @xmath183 is the number of observed lmwds .",
