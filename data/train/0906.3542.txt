    "the charge , orbital , and spin degrees of freedom of the few electrons in the valence states of a material play an important role in its electronic properties .",
    "resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) , enhanced by the brightness , tunability , and high degree of polarization available at x - ray synchrotron sources , is an effective technique to measure these microscopic variables . in rxs , by studying intensities at space - group - forbidden reflections , dipolar and quadrupolar order parameters can be studied  @xcite .",
    "only recently has it become possible to access such ordering phenomena by means of resonant x - ray diffraction .",
    "higher multipolar orderings can be studied by resonant x - ray diffraction : octupoles  @xcite , hexadecapoles  @xcite , anapoles  @xcite .",
    "also non - resonant x - ray diffraction can give information on higher order multipolar orderings  @xcite .",
    "dyb@xmath0c@xmath0 shows the highest antiferroquadrupole ( afq ) transition with @xmath4  k  @xcite .",
    "the ordering of quadrupoles in dyb@xmath0c@xmath0 has been studied intensively with resonant x - ray scattering  @xcite and neutron diffraction in magnetic fields  @xcite . at the afq ordering temperature @xmath5 the space group symmetry of the material is reduced from p4/mbm to p4@xmath0/mnm  @xcite with a doubling of the unit cell along the c - axis . below @xmath6",

    "@xcite report isotropic absorption measurements and soft x - ray resonant diffraction at the @xmath1 space group forbidden reflection at the dy m@xmath2 edges in the antiferroquadrupolar ordered ( afq ) and antiferromagnetic phase ( afm ) . a possible charge scattering contribution is ruled out , as then s and p incident spectra would differ by orders of magnitude and would have a completely different shape in energy as the bragg angle is close to 45 degrees . in order to justify the shape of the resonant diffraction energy profile , mulders et al .",
    "@xcite use a simple model for describing resonant x - ray scattering in terms of single oscillators for each of the @xmath7 quantum numbers for the @xmath8 core holes at the @xmath9 edges .",
    "the degeneration of the resonant oscillators would be splited due to a coulomb intra - atomic quadrupolar interaction , given by @xmath10 q_{\\bar{j}}$ ] , similarly to mossbauer spectroscopy , and which would be produced by the ordered quadrupolar moment in the 4f shell .",
    "a similar core - valence interaction between the valence octupole moment and the core hole was used in npo@xmath0  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the effect of such dependence of the core - hole interaction , going beyond the analysis done in  @xcite by using a full atomic multiplet hamiltonian including the effect of crystal field .",
    "we calculate the resonant x - ray scattering factor for the dipolar transition 4f@xmath11 @xmath12 3@xmath134f@xmath14 by making use of the program hilbert++  @xcite .",
    "the program starts from a model hamiltonian accounting for multiplets and hybridization , written in terms of creation and destruction operators , and applies lanczos tridiagonalization to the hilbert space spanned by the electronic degrees of freedom of the absorber ion and its nearest neighbours to find the ground state @xmath15 .",
    "the resonant x - ray scattering tensor is calculated as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the hamiltonian of the excited state , @xmath18 is the dipole operator and @xmath19 is the lifetime broadening .",
    "we use a model hamiltonian that includes the atomic multiplets and the crystal field interaction with the neighbouring ions , @xmath20 cowan s atomic multiplet program provides ab initio hartree - fock values of the radial coulomb slater integrals and the spin - orbit interactions for an isolated ion . in order to take into account the screening effects present in the real system with respect to the atomic picture we scale down all the slater integrals to 75% of their atomic values . to model the interaction with the neighbouring ions ,",
    "we construct a crystal field term simulating the effect of hybridization with the carbon first neighbour ions , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the energy displacement in the dy @xmath23 orbital produced by a ligand ion along the z axis and @xmath24 denote creation / destruction operators in the f shell of the dy ion being the local z axis orientated along the bond direction of each of the neighbouring atoms . this term is summed over the bonding atoms ( we consider 8 nearest neighbours ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is rescaled according to the bond length .",
    "we use the available structural information  @xcite on the environment of first neighbour c ions around a dy site . following adachi et al .",
    "@xcite , in the structure of the quadrupolar ordered phase , we add displacement along the c axis of the positions of the c ions from its positions in the high temperature p4/mbm space group .    in the excited hamiltonian we introduce a splitting of the core states due to the intra - atomic quadrupole interaction @xmath25  @xcite , @xmath10 q_{\\bar{j}}$ ] , where @xmath25 is the product of the 3d quadrupole moment and the f - electron electric field gradient experienced by the 3d electrons with @xmath26 . the introduction of this splitting is necessary due to the difficulty in modeling the crystal field and the interactions that exists in this system , such as the fact that for the 4f shell the point charge model is not good , screening , or the effect of the polarization of the 5d states  @xcite .",
    "the best fit to the x - ray diffraction and absorption spectra taken in the afq phase ( @xmath27  k )  @xcite correspond to the parameters @xmath28 ev and @xmath29 ev . the fitting of the isotropic absorption and the resonant x - ray diffraction energy profile at the reflection @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the plot",
    ", we also show the shape that the spectra would have without the core - hole interaction , i.e. @xmath30 . in the calculated spectra we consider a boltzmann average in order to take into account the effect of the temperature .",
    "it is worth noting that , from the fitting to the experimental spectra we use a positive value of @xmath28 ev , while in  @xcite , a value of -0.4 ev is used .",
    "the change of sign would mean that the positioning of the harmonic oscillators with different values of @xmath7 in fig . 2 of reference  @xcite would be reversed . using a negative value of @xmath31 in our calculation , would lead to a much worse agreement with the diffraction energy profile .",
    "experimentally measured isotropic absorption and resonant x - ray diffraction spectra at the @xmath1 space group forbidden reflection and absorption spectra taken in the afq phase ( t=18 k )  @xcite together with the calculated spectra , corresponding to the parameter @xmath22 = 0.1 ev .",

    "2 are normalized to have the same intensity at energies lower than 1282 ev . our calculated spectra shown in fig .",
