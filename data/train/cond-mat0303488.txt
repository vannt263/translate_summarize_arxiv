    "azobenzene and its derivatives have been attracted much attention over the past few decades because of a number of fascinating features of these compounds .",
    "they were initially used in preparation of paints , because of rich spectrum of colors that can be obtained depending on the chemical structure of azochromophores .",
    "further investigations revealed strong photochromism ( photomodification of color ) of azobenzene derivatives .",
    "it was found that this effect in azobenzene derivatives can be accompanied by a novel phenomenon that is known as photoinduced optical anisotropy ( poa ) and can be detected in dichroism and birefringence measurements  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of poa opened up a new chapter in studies of azobenzene compounds .",
    "neporent and stolbova  @xcite described poa in viscous solutions of azodyes , then todorov and co - workers  @xcite disclosed the same phenomenon in azodye - polymer blends .",
    "the anisotropy induced in these systems is rather unstable .",
    "the stable poa was observed later on in polymers containing chemically linked azochromophores ( azopolymers )  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that stable anisotropy can be induced in both amorphous and liquid crystalline ( lc ) azopolymers  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of poa in lc azopolymers is generally much higher than it is for amorphous homologues .",
    "for example , the photoinduced birefringence can be as high as 0.3  @xcite that is a typical value for low - molecular - weight lcs  @xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the macroscopic anisotropy detected in optical experiments reflects the microscopic orientational order of polymer fragments which is mainly determined by the order of azochromophores in _",
    "trans _   configuration .",
    "there are two known phenomena underlying the process of orientational ordering of the azochromophores : ( a )  strong absorption dichroism of azobenzene groups that have the optical transition dipole moment approximately directed along the long molecular axis ; ( b )  photochemically induced _",
    "trans_-_cis _",
    "isomerization and subsequent thermal and/or photochemical _ cis_-_trans _   back isomerization of azobenzene moieties .",
    "it means that the rate of the photoinduced isomerization strongly depends on orientation of the azobenzene chromophores relative to the polarization vector of actinic light @xmath0 .",
    "the fragments oriented perpendicular to @xmath0 are almost inactive , whereas the groups with the long axes parallel to @xmath0 are the most active for isomerization .",
    "there are two different regimes of the photoinduced ordering .",
    "these regimes are usually recognized as two limiting cases related to the lifetime of _ cis _   isomers under irradiation , and were theoretically considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    if _ cis _  isomers are long - living , the anisotropy is caused by angular selective burning of mesogenic _",
    "isomers due to stimulated transitions to non - mesogenic _ cis _   form .",
    "the transition rate is angular dependent , so that the _ trans _   azochromophores normally oriented to @xmath0 are the least burned .",
    "this direction will define the axis of the induced anisotropy .",
    "this regime of poa is known as the mechanism of angular hole burning ( photoselection ) .    in the opposite case of short - living _ cis _  isomers ,",
    "the azochromophores are excited many times during the poa generation period .",
    "these _ trans_-_cis_-_trans _",
    "isomerization cycles are accompanied by rotations of the azochromophores that tend to assume orientation transverse to @xmath0 and minimize the absorption .",
    "non - photosensitive groups can be involved in the process of reorientation due to cooperative motion  @xcite .",
    "this regime is referred to as the photo - reorientation ( angular redistribution ) mechanism .    from the above",
    "it might be concluded that , whichever mechanism of the ordering is assumed , the exciting light causes preferential alignment of azobenzene chromophores along the directions perpendicular to the polarization vector of the actinic light . in 3d space",
    "these directions form the plane normal to @xmath0 .",
    "it can be expected that the angular distribution of azochromophores in this plane is isotropic . from the experimental results , however , this is not the case .",
    "the uniaxial ordering with strongly preferred in - plane alignment was observed in refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was found that the photoinduced orientational structures can show biaxiality  @xcite .",
    "this implies that actually the system is not spherically symmetric in the absence of light and some of the above directions are preferred depending on a number of additional factors such as irradiation conditions , chemical structure of polymers , surface interaction etc .",
    "these factors combined with the action of light may result in a large variety of orientational configurations ( uniaxial , biaxial , splayed ) characterized by different spatial orientations of the principal axes .    in the past years",
    "this spatial character of the photoinduced anisotropies has not received much attention and , until recently , it has been neglected in the bulk of experimental and theoretical studies of poa in azobenzene containing polymers  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the problems related to the 3d orientational structures in polymeric films are currently of considerable importance in the development of new compensation films for liquid crystal ( lc ) displays  @xcite and the pretilt angle generation by the use of photoalignment method of lc orientation  @xcite .",
    "the known methods suitable for the experimental study of the 3d orientational distributions in polymer films can be divided into two groups .",
    "the methods of the first group are based on absorption measurements .",
    "these methods have the indisputable advantage that the order parameters of various molecular groups can be estimated from the results of these measurements .",
    "shortcomings of the known absorption methods  @xcite are the limited field of applications and the strong approximations .",
    "the second group includes the methods dealing with principal refractive indices .",
    "recently several variations of the prism coupling methods have been applied to measure the principal refractive indices in azopolymer films  @xcite .",
    "these results , however , were not used for in - depth analysis of such features of the spatial ordering as biaxiality and spatial orientation of the optical axes depending on polymer chemical structure , irradiation conditions etc .",
    "our goal is a comprehensive investigation of the peculiarities of 3d orientational ordering in azopolymers .    in our previous studies",
    "@xcite we were mainly concerned with the effects related to the peculiarities of azopolymer self - organization that , in addition to the symmetry axis defined by the light polarization , affect the light - induced 3d ordering . the combination of methods described in ref .",
    "@xcite was found to be an experimental technique particularly suitable to characterize light induced anisotropy of orientational structures in azopolymer films .",
    "we have investigated these structures depending on the polarization state of the actinic light  @xcite and on the molecular constitution  @xcite .",
    "it was additionally found that the kinetics of poa involving both uniaxial and biaxial structures can be theoretically described by using the phenomenological approach suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on the features of the 3d orientation determined by the discussed above mechanisms of the photo - induced ordering .",
    "the different regimes of poa are realized experimentally by choosing appropriate polymers and irradiation conditions .",
    "there are two azopolymers of different structure used in this study and the optical anisotropy was induced by irradiating the samples at two different wavelengths .",
    "we find that the regime of poa in one of the polymers strongly depends on the wavelength of the exciting light , whereas the other presents the case in which poa is governed by the photo - reorientation mechanism regardless of the wavelength .",
    "we show that the experimental results can be interpreted on the basis of the phenomenological model describing the kinetics of poa in terms of angular redistribution probabilities and order parameter correlation functions .",
    "this model can be deduced by using the procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite and is found to give the results that are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "we also apply the model to calculate the out - of - plane absorbance that can not be directly estimated from the results of measurements in the regime of photoselection .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] contains the details on the combination of null ellipsometry and absorption methods used in this study as an experimental procedure .",
    "the experimentally measured dependencies of birefringence and absorption dichroism on the illumination doses are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : exper - results ] .",
    "we draw together these results to unambiguously identify the anisotropy of the orientational structures induced in azopolymer films and to measure the ordering of azochromophores through the absorption order parameter .",
    "anisotropy of the initial structures and of the structures in the regime of photosaturation is found to be uniaxial in both azopolymers . at early stages of irradiation the transient anisotropic structures",
    "are biaxial .",
    "it is shown that under certain conditions the regime of the kinetics of poa can be changed with the wavelength of the pumping light .",

    "the polymers were characterized by elemental analysis and 1h nmr spectroscopy .",
    "molecular weight of the polymers was determined by gel permeation chromatography .",
    "the average molecular weight of p1 and p2 is estimated at 13,500 g / mol and 36,000 g / mol , respectively .",
    "both materials are comb - like polymers with azobenzene fragments in side chains connected by flexible alkyl spacers to the polymer backbone .",
    "the azobenzene chromophore of the polymer p1 contains polar @xmath1 end group that has strong acceptor properties .",
    "the azobenzene chromophore of polymer p2 contains hydrophobic alkyl tail @xmath2 .",
    "the phase transitions in the polymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and polarization microscopy .",
    "both azopolymers are found to possess liquid crystalline properties in the respective temperature regions .",

    "the wavelength of the maximal absorption , @xmath5 , for polymer p1 containing chromophore with push - pull properties is shifted to the red as compared to @xmath5 for p2 .",
    "the anisotropy in the films was induced under irradiation from two different sources of light with different wavelengths @xmath6 and intensities",
    "@xmath7 :    1 .   an ar@xmath8 laser with @xmath9  nm and @xmath10  w/@xmath11 ; 2 .   a mercury lamp with @xmath12  nm and @xmath13  mw/@xmath11 . in this case",
    "the light was selected by an interference filter and polarized with a glan - tompson polarization prism .",
    "the wavelengths @xmath14  nm and @xmath15  nm fall into @xmath4 and n@xmath16 absorption band of azopolymers , respectively . in both cases",
    "the films were irradiated at normal incidence of the actinic light .",
    "the irradiation was carried out in several steps followed by studies of the orientational structure .",
    "the resulting time of irradiation was calculated by adding irradiation times of all irradiation steps assuming accumulation of the structural changes .",
    "the time interval between irradiation and structural studies was about 15  min .",
    "the reason for time delay between these processes will be discussed below .      instead of the prism coupling methods commonly used for the estimation of principal refractive indices we applied null ellipsometry technique  @xcite dealing with birefringence components .",
    "by this means we have avoided some disadvantages of prism coupling method such as the problem of making optical contact between the prism and the polymer layer .    the optical scheme of our method is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the polymer film is placed between crossed polarizer and analyzer and a quarter wave plate with the optic axes oriented parallel to the polarization direction of the polarizer .",
    "the light beam , which wavelength is far away from the absorption band of the polymer , is passing through the optical system .",
    "the elliptically polarized beam passing through the sample is transformed into the linearly polarized light by means of the quarter wave plate .",
    "the polarization plane of this light is turned with respect to the polarization direction of the polarizer .",
    "this rotation is related to the phase retardation acquired by the light beam after passing through the film under investigation .",
    "it can be compensated by rotating the analyzer by the angle @xmath17 that encodes information on the phase retardation .",
    "this method used for the normal incidence of the testing light is known as the senarmont technique .",
    "it is suitable for the in - plane birefringence measurements .    using oblique incidence of the testing beam",
    "we have extended this method for estimation of both in - plane , @xmath18 , and out - of - plane @xmath19 birefringence ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the principal refractive indices of the film ) . in this case , the angle @xmath17 depends on the in - plane retardation @xmath23 , the out - of - plane retardation @xmath24 and the absolute value of a refractive index of the biaxial film , say , @xmath20 .",
    "we need to have the light coming out of the quarter wave plate almost linearly polarized when the system analyzes the phase shift between two orthogonal eigenmodes of the sample . in our experimental setup this requirement can be met , when the @xmath25 axis , directed along the polarization vector of the actinic light , is oriented horizontally or vertically .",
    "dependencies of the analyzer rotation angle @xmath17 on the incidence angle of the testing beam @xmath26 were measured for both vertical and horizontal orientation of the @xmath25 axis .",
    "the value of @xmath20 was measured with the abbe refractometer independently .    by using berreman s @xmath27 matrix method  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath26-dependencies of @xmath17 were calculated .",
    "maxwell s equations for the light propagation through the system of polarizer , sample and quarter wave plate were solved numerically for the different configurations of optical axes in the samples .",
    "the measured and computed @xmath17 versus @xmath26 curves were fitted in the most probable configuration model using the measured value of @xmath20 .",
    "we conclude on alignment of the azobenzene fragments from the obtained values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 assuming that the preferred direction of these fragments coincides with the direction of the largest refractive index .",

    "the light intensity was measured with a photodiode .",
    "the setup was automatically controlled by a personal computer .",
    "the rotation accuracy of the analyzer was better than 0.2  degree .",
    "the uv / vis absorption measurements were carried out using a diode array spectrometer ( oceanoptics ) .",
    "the samples were set normally to the testing beam of a deuterium lamp .",
    "a glan - thompson prism mounted on a computer - driven stepper was used to control the polarization of the testing beam , @xmath29 .",
    "the uv spectra of both original and irradiated films were measured in the spectral range from 250  nm to 600  nm for the probing light linearly polarized along the @xmath25 and @xmath30 axes . from these data",
    "the optical density components @xmath31 and @xmath32 were estimated at the absorption maximum of azochromophores , @xmath33  nm ( for polymer p1 ) and @xmath34  nm ( for polymer p2 ) .    in general , it is difficult to estimate the out - of - plane absorption coefficient @xmath35 .",
    "this , however , can be done in the regime of poa where the fraction of _ cis _  isomers is negligible ( the photo - reorientation mechanism ) by using the method proposed in refs .",
    "the key point is that the sum of all the principal absorption coefficients , @xmath36 , does not depend on irradiation doses .",
    "so , if the anisotropy is known to be uniaxial at time @xmath37 with either @xmath38 or @xmath39 , this will yield the relation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the optical axis and @xmath42 is the @xmath43th coordinate unit vector .",

    "for instance , sufficiently polarized azochromophores ( push - pull chromophores ) usually have short - living _ cis _  isomers .",
    "on the other hand , the chromophores containing long alkyl substitutes are characterized by long - living _ cis _  form .",
    "our results show that the polymers under consideration comply with these rules .",
    "in addition , the molecular structure of azopolymers determines self - organization of azochromophores , which in turn affects 3d orientational ordering . by self - organization",
    "is meant a number of complex processes related to the spontaneous alignment and aggregation of anisotropic azobenzene chromophores , processes of collective orientation , self - assembling at the interfaces etc .",
    "the initial anisotropy of non - irradiated polymer films is defined by these processes .",
    "we found that the azochromophores in p1 films prefer in - plane orientation , whereas the preferential alignment of the fragments in p2 films is homeotropic .",
    "the factors responsible for this difference have not been studied in any detail yet .",
    "the intrinsic self - organization of azochromophores also plays a part in the ordering stimulated by actinic light  @xcite .",
    "the excitation of azochromophores stimulates these processes of self - organization that are slowed down in the glassy state .",
    "the contribution of self - organization processes may explain different anisotropies observed in polymers p1 and p2 on reaching the state of photo - saturation .",
    "the positive in - plane order , observed in polymer p1 , is determined by the strong preference of azochromophores to in - plane alignment .",
    "the negative in - plane order induced in polymer p2 by the light with @xmath67  nm may be explained by assuming the dominating role of the photo - reorientation mechanism .",
    "generally , we know from experience that the negative uniaxial anisotropy with the optical axis parallel to the polarization vector of the exciting light can be easily induced in polymers showing preference to out - of - plane alignment of azochromophores .    the photosaturated state of polymer p2 films irradiated at @xmath69  nm is found to be optically isotropic with @xmath65 . as we have already noted in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : p2 - 365 ] , extremely low concentration of _ trans",
    "_  chromophores will render the film effectively isotropic .",
    "this is the case even if the angular distribution of _ trans _",
    "isomers retains an amount of anisotropy caused by the angular selective character of the burning process . from the other hand , non - mesogenic _ cis _  isomers at high concentrations",
    "could result in disordering effects up to suppressing lc properties of azopolymers  @xcite . from our optical measurements",
    "we can not unambiguously conclude on significance of these effects for polymer p2 .",
    "thus , in the regime of photo - reorientation the orientational structures observed in the photo - saturation state are uniaxial with optical axes determined by the polarization of the light and by the favored orientation of the azochromophores . in the case of photoselection",
    "these structures are optically isotropic .",
    "the anisotropic structures induced at early stages of irradiation are biaxial .",
    "these transient structures are formed in passing from the initial uniaxial structure to the state of photo - saturation .",
    "self - organization of azochromophores under irradiation implies their collective orientation and liquid crystallinity .",
    "the other collective mode is related to the orientation of non - photosensitive fragments ( matrix ) that is influenced by the orientation of azochromophores . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the latter factor seems to be of crucial importance in stabilizing the photoinduced order .    in our experiments",
    "the photoinduced anisotropy has been seen to be stable over at least several weeks .",
    "the anisotropy can be erased and rewritten by the light .",
    "this long term stability of the induced order implies effective orientation of polymer matrix in both photo - reorientation and photoselection regimes of poa .    in order to interpret the experimental results on the kinetics of the photoinduced absorption dichroism we employed the theoretical model formulated by using the phenomenological approach of refs .",
    "this approach describes the kinetics of poa in terms of one - particle angular distribution functions and angular redistribution probabilities .",
    "the probabilities enter the photoisomerization rates and define coupling between the azochromophores and the anisotropic field represented by the distribution function of the polymer matrix @xmath163 .",
    "this anisotropic field reflects the presence of long - living angular correlations and stabilizes the photoinduced anisotropy .",
    "the key assumption of the model is that the _ cis _",
    "fragments are isotropic and do not affect the ordering kinetics directly .",
    "certainly , this is the simplest case to start from before studying more complicated models .",
    "so , we studied the predictions of this simple model for both polymers to test its applicability . to this end",
    "we have estimated a number of photochemical parameters that enter the model from the experimental data .",
    "only the absorption anisotropy parameters and the quantum yields need to be adjusted .",
    "the comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data shows that the model correctly captures the basic features of poa in azopolymers .",
    "we have additionally calculated the out - of - plane absorbance @xmath35 and the absorption order parameters @xmath44 in the photoselection regime where the experimental method of estimation is inapplicable .",
    "the model has also been applied to estimate concentrations of isomers , quantum yields of photoisomerization and anisotropy of molecular absorption .",
    "it provides a criterion for the occurrence of different mechanisms and describes the biaxiality effects .",
    "so , we have demonstrated that the phenomenological approach of  @xcite can be used as a useful tool for studying photoinduced ordering processes in azopolymers .",
    "but it should be noted that theoretical approaches of this sort , by definition , do not involve explicit considerations of microscopic details of azopolymer physics .",
    "a more comprehensive study is required to relate the effective parameters of our model and physical parameters characterizing interactions between molecular units of polymers .",
    "for example , the initial anisotropy of polymer films is taken into account through the initial conditions for the kinetic equations and",
    "the theory then properly describes the biaxiality effects .",
    "but the process of structure formation in non - irradiated polymer films is well beyond the scope of the model and such description can not serve as an explanation of biaxiality .",
    "similarly , the suppressed out - of - plane reorientation of azochromophores in polymer p1 is treated as a constraint imposed by the polymeric environment and is taken into consideration by modifying the order parameter correlation functions .",
    "our results show that neglecting the influence of _ cis _  isomers on the orientational order of the anisotropic _ trans _  isomers does not lead to considerable discrepancies between the theoretical results and the experimental data . in general , the presence of non - mesogenic _ cis_isomers could give rise to deterioration of the photoinduced order of _ trans _  fragments . in the regime of photoselection",
    "this effect will eventually produce nearly isotropic angular distribution of _ trans _  isomers . on the other hand",
    ", our model predicts that in polymer p2 this distribution is always anisotropic with non - vanishing order parameters of _ trans",
    "_  fragments .",
    "( in this case the order parameters are not proportional to @xmath44 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : p2 - 365](c ) that go to zero due to depletion of the _ trans _  state . )",
    "though the model is successful in describing our experiments , it can be modified to study the case in which the disordering effect caused by _",
    "cis_isomers can not be disregarded .",
    "this study was partially supported by crdf ( grant up1 - 2121b ) .",
    "we also thank dr .",
