    "there are now extensive experimental results on nucleon structure functions in deep inelastic scattering , providing a detailed empirical knowledge of the distribution of quarks and gluons in the nucleon .",
    "thus a major theoretical challenge for lattice qcd is to understand this data from first principles and assess errors in current methods due to the quenched approximation and the finite lattice spacing in naive lattice operators .",
    "we envision a gradual improvement of lattice methodology to reduce these errors .",
    "since structure functions can not be calculated directly on a euclidean lattice , we consider low moments which are related to matrix elements of local operators by the operator product expansion .",
    "the lattice matrix elements relevant to moments of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 structure functions are being calculated on quenched @xmath5 lattices at @xmath6 at three quark masses , and initial results are presented below .",
    "in the continuum , the quark contribution to the moments of the unpolarized @xmath2 , longitudinally polarized @xmath3 and transversely polarized @xmath4 structure functions are related to the matrix elements , @xmath7 respectively , where we have indicated on the right the scalar coefficient in the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our methodology for calculating these operators on the lattice is similar to gckeler et al@xcite .",
    "the covariant derivative is replaced by a lattice finite difference and the operators are classified by representations of the surviving discrete subgroup @xmath8 of the continuum euclidean lorentz group @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization factors @xmath10 are calculated using a new method  @xcite to one loop order in lattice perturbation series to account for a multiplicative shift of the wilson coefficient due replacing the @xmath11 scheme at scale @xmath12 by the lattice spacing @xmath13 .",
    "our independently derived results confirm those in the literature  @xcite and extend them where necessary . for our current set of moments",
    "the results are given in the table .",
    "typical elements of an irreducible representation ( ir ) of @xmath8 are given in the second column , where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 $ ] brackets imply symmetrized and anti - symmetries indices respectively .",
    "in many cases there is more than one ir corresponding to the continuum operator .",
    "we are exploring other representations to have a redundant set of measurements .",

    "on the cm-5 at mit , we have generated 150 independent @xmath0 lattices using the standard wilson action .",
    "dirac propagators for wilson fermions with @xmath31 are being calculated by conjugate gradient iterations with red - black preconditioning for the values of @xmath32 corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath34 mev .",
    "our estimates for @xmath35 and the lattice spacing derived from @xmath36 and @xmath37 masses are in a good agreement with those of ukqcd .      to compute the matrix elements we considered four types of sources : point sources ( p ) , gauge invariant wuppertal  @xcite sources ( w ) and both coulomb gauge fixed wuppertal ( u ) and gaussian ( g ) smeared sources . to determine the most suitable form of the source , we investigated the plateau in @xmath38 for the two point functions for the pion , rho and nucleon sources . for the proton creation operator",
    ", we used @xmath39 , with @xmath40 and with all quark operators truncated to 2 upper components .",
    "some comparisons are shown for the nucleon case in fig .",
    "[ fig : smeared ] .",
    "the gaussian ( g ) and the two wuppertal ( w & u ) sources were adjusted so @xmath41 for each quark field , since this smearing produced the least noisy results in all three cases . for more localized sources the excited states are more prominent , whereas for less localized sources the signal becomes noisier at large distances .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : smeared ] , smearing both the sources and the sink results in substantially noisier behavior than smearing only the source . on the scale of the errors in fig .",
    "[ fig : smeared ] , there is no significant difference between smeared source  point sink vs. point source  smeared sink . it is interesting to note that the gauge fixed wuppertal ( d ) and gauge invariant wuppertal ( w ) sources are essentially equivalent .",
    "we illustrate our preliminary results with a first ( low statistics ) measurement of the tensor charge  @xcite .",
    "( also see results by aoki et al@xcite . ) to date we have analyzed @xmath42 configurations with @xmath43 for @xmath32 respectively and @xmath44 configurations at @xmath45 for the same kappa values .",
    "the gaussian smeared source is placed at @xmath46 and the momentum projected point sink at @xmath47 .",
    "we measure three point functions in the following way .",
    "once a gauge field is generated , it is gauge fixed to the coulomb gauge and a set of quark propagators is computed .",
    "then for every operator the corresponding 3-point function is constructed from the set of propagators .",
    "we calculate separately the 2-point function , comparing backward and forward propagators independently to verify convergence .",
    "finally , we use the jackknife method to estimate statistical errors of the ratio of three- and two - point functions . since we need to fix the final state momentum of the nucleon before calculating the backward propagators , the set of propagators has a built - in final state momentum .",
    "the first moment @xmath29 of the transversity distribution @xmath48 can be measured using the final state at rest @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ t0:p=0 ] the three upper plots show preliminary results for @xmath29 at the three kappas we used . even for the low statistics ( 15 configurations for the smallest @xmath50 ) , the plateau in the signal is clearly visible .",
    "one can also see that as @xmath50 approaches the chiral limit , the signal becomes noisier as expected .",
    "since other moments require non - zero momentum at the sink , it might be useful to consider a single set of propagators with non - zero momenta to measure all observables . as a comparison , the lowest plot in fig .",
    "[ t0:p=0]d gives the same tensor charge computed at @xmath51 . to make this a fair comparison with the @xmath49 case",
    ", we have used the same set of configurations with propagators calculated to the same precision .",
    "it appears to have considerably stronger fluctuations , thus raising the question as to whether the exclusive use of non - zero momenta is an optimal strategy .",
