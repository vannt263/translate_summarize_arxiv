    "solitons corresponding to baryons have been found in several chiral quark models .",
    "many of these solutions turn out to be unstable against collapse unless additional constraints are introduced in the model .",
    "the well known examples are the linear njl model with proper time regularization @xcite and the linear @xmath0-model with sea quarks @xcite . even in the linear @xmath0-model with only valence",
    "quarks the energy of the soliton becomes too low for any choice of model parameters if one goes beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "in all these models the instability occurs because it is energetically favorable for the chiral field to acquire arbitrary ( or very ) high gradients .",
    "this suggests that cutting off high momenta in the interaction may prevent the collapse and stabilize the soliton .",
    "a simple sharp cut - off does not yield a stable solution while a smooth behavior of the regulator ( usually interpreted as a @xmath1-dependent quark mass ) can indeed lead to solitons which are stable against the decay into free quarks as well as against collapse .",
    "such a regularization has a physical justification in qcd calculations of the quark propagation in an instanton liquid which predict a non - local effective interaction between quarks with a 4-momentum cut - off @xmath2  mev @xcite .",
    "further physical implications of the non - local regularization are discussed in the contributions to this workshop by george ripka and wojciech broniowski  @xcite .",
    "the non - local regularization of the quark - quark interaction can be implemented in the njl type models by replacing the contact term @xmath3 , @xmath4 by a non - local form .",
    "usually one introduces a regulator @xmath5 diagonal in 4-momentum space such that @xmath6 .",
    "the qcd derivation of the quark propagation in a dilute instanton gas predicts the following functional dependence for @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the instanton size of the order @xmath10 . as we shall see in the following it",
    "is necessary to analytically continue the regulator to negative @xmath11 in order to be able to treat the valence orbit .",
    "this is not possible with the form ( [ instanton ] ) since it has a cut along the negative real axis starting at @xmath12 .",
    "we use instead a gaussian shape of the regulator : @xmath13 or a `` monopole '' shape : @xmath14 which has the proper behavior for large @xmath11 where one gluon exchange dominates .",
    "the expression for the energy of the soliton and the self - consistency equations can be derived from the bosonized euclidean action @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the chiral fields and are the dynamical variables of the system .",
    "the main difficulty is the presence of time in the regulator . in order to evaluate the trace in ( [ action ] ) it is convenient to introduce energy dependent basis states , which are solutions of the dirac equation : @xmath18 with @xmath19    from ( [ action ] ) the following expression for a stationary configuration can be derived @xcite : @xmath20 note that when no regulator ( i.e. @xmath21 ) or a time - independent regulator is used , the energies @xmath22 are independent of @xmath23 and the integration can be carried out using the cauchy theorem . closing the contour from below yields the well known expression for the energy of the dirac sea : @xmath24 .",
    "( note that the energies of occupied orbits lie on the negative imaginary @xmath23-axis . )",
    "when the soliton describes a baryon , the energy of three valence quarks is added to the energy of the dirac sea .",
    "the same result can be formally obtained by deforming the contour in ( [ energy ] ) in such a way as to encircle the valence orbit ( for detailed discussion on this point see wojciech broniowski contribution to this workshop ) .",
    "such a prescription gives the expected result provided the orbits do not depend on @xmath23 .",
    "however , when the regulator depends on time ( or @xmath23 ) , this may not lead to the correct result since the regulator generates additional poles scattered in the whole complex @xmath23-plane .",
    "it may still work well for an isolated pole on the positive imaginary axis close to 0 as is the case of the @xmath25 orbit in the soliton with the hedgehog form of the background chiral field @xcite .",
    "this pole can then be treated separately , yielding the valence contribution to the soliton energy @xmath26 , where the energy of the valence orbit is determined from @xmath27 the soliton energy can now be written as : @xmath28 the sea contribution is @xmath29\\ ] ] with @xmath30 and is evaluated by direct numerical integration along the real @xmath23-axis . the term @xmath31 is given by the last integral in ( [ energy ] ) ( with the integrand @xmath32 ) .",
    "the above prescription is further supported by the fact that it gives an exact result for the baryon number , which can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath33    the self - consistent equations derived from ( [ action ] ) take the form ( the hedgehog ansatz , @xmath34 , for the pion field is assumed ) : @xmath35\\ ; , \\label{sceq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the residue of the valence pole .",
    "a necessary condition for a stable soliton configuration is that the energy ( [ energy ] ) is lower than the energy of three free quarks .",
    "when the regulator depends on time , the free quark mass , @xmath38 , is not simply the vacuum value of the chiral field , @xmath39 , but is determined by the position of the pole of the quark propagator in the vacuum @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ it corresponds to the solution of @xmath40 .",
    "the solution for real @xmath11 exists only below a critical value of @xmath39 ( see figure  [ figep ] ) ; above this point no stable free quarks exist .",
    "however , a stable solution can always be found beyond this point provided the quarks dress in a spatially non - uniform background chiral field .    ' '' ''    height 0pt depth 0pt",
    "the model ( [ action ] ) possesses 4 parameters : the vacuum value of the chiral field @xmath39 , the current quark mass @xmath41 , the coupling constant @xmath42 and the cut - off parameter @xmath43 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath42 is fixed from the stationarity condition in the vacuum , @xmath43 is fitted to the pion decay constant @xmath44 , and @xmath41 to @xmath45 .",
    "we are left with one free parameter @xmath39 .    in this section",
    "we analyze how different shapes of the regulator affect the result .",
    "we compare the gaussian ( [ gaussian ] ) , the monopole ( [ pole ] ) and a modified version of the instanton ( [ instanton ] ) regulator .",
    "as we have mentioned it is not possible to continue ( [ instanton ] ) to negative @xmath11 , which is needed in order to obtain the valence contribution .",
    "we have instead introduced a form which is identical to the instanton regulator for @xmath46 while its behavior for @xmath47 is replaced by a real function which approximately follows the real part of ( [ instanton ] ) for small negative @xmath11 ( `` extended instanton '' ) .",
    "the gaussian and the monopole shapes lead to practically identical results .",
    "we have also tried other shapes and found very similar results .",
    "the reason is that several properties ( including the integral that determines @xmath44 ) depend mostly on the behavior of the regulator for small value of @xmath11 .",
    "if this behavior is @xmath48 then @xmath49 is almost uniquely determined by the value of @xmath44 .",
    "hence , all shapes with this type of behavior lead to very similar results .",
    "the situation is quite different if @xmath50 , _ e.g. _ for regulators that depend only on @xmath51 .",
    "we do not find stable solutions for such regulators ; the energy of the dirac sea is always higher than the gain due to the lowering of the valence energy .",
    "the form ( [ instanton ] ) has neither of the above behaviors for @xmath52 but behaves as @xmath53 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to check whether stable solitons can also be obtained for such a particular form .",
    "we indeed find solitons with very similar properties to those obtained using ( [ gaussian ] ) or ( [ pole ] ) .    since @xmath44 sets the scale , it is also interesting to study how a higher value for @xmath44 would affect the results .",
    ".properties of the self - consistent soliton solutions for different shapes of the regulator , `` extanton '' stands for the extended instanton regulator with @xmath54 , gaussian@xmath55 means a gaussian regulator with @xmath43 fitted to @xmath56  mev , @xmath57 is the one - flavor quark condensate .

    "the calculation can be made much simpler and the problem of analytic continuation to negative @xmath11 avoided if we take a regulator that does not depend on time .",
    "then the states do not depend on @xmath23 and the integration over @xmath23 in the above expressions can be carried out analytically .",
    "all quantities still remain finite and the soliton remains stable against collapse .",
    "the parameters used are the same as for the 4-momentum regulator .",
    "however , the explicit breaking of lorentz invariance leads to serious problems which we discuss in this section .",
    "the energy of the soliton reduces to @xmath58 and the self - consistency equation to @xmath59\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the simplest form of the regulator is a sharp cut - off limiting the 3-momenta to @xmath60 .",
    "since one usually uses basis states with good @xmath61 , this is equivalent to restricting the hilbert space .",
    "such a form is very easy to implement since the regulator does not appear explicitly in the calculation .",
    "unfortunately , no stable soliton solution is found in this case ; the contribution of the sea quarks is always larger than the gain due to the lowering of the valence energy .",
    "stable solutions can be obtained if one takes a smooth form of the regulator , e.g. a gaussian form @xmath62 .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ fige3d ] .",
    "the threshold value of @xmath39 below which the soliton does not exist is somewhat larger than for the 4-momentum gaussian regulator .",
    "one notices a rather striking feature that the soliton does not exist _ beyond _ a certain value of @xmath39 .",
    "the reason for such behavior is the following : the energy of a free quark can be written as @xmath63 . for sufficiently small @xmath64",
    "the minimum of @xmath65 is not at @xmath66 but rather at some @xmath67 , and the energy of a free quark becomes smaller than @xmath39 . increasing @xmath39 the cut - off @xmath43 decreases and at a certain value",
    "it becomes energetically favorable for the quarks in the soliton to acquire sufficiently high momenta and leave the soliton .",
    "this happens when @xmath68 .",
    "such an unphysical behavior is a clear consequence of breaking the lorentz invariance in the interaction .",
    "the value of @xmath69 can be easily determined if we choose a gaussian regulator and @xmath70 . for the values of @xmath43 below @xmath71",
    "the minimum of @xmath72 occurs for @xmath73 and the free quark energy at the minimum is : @xmath74 . for @xmath75 this value",
    "is slightly modified : @xmath76 ^ 2\\;.\\ ] ]    figure  [ fige3d ] shows that the soliton exists for @xmath77  mev . at @xmath78",
    "mev the cut - off @xmath43 reaches the critical value and the lowest free quark state has @xmath79 . nonetheless , the soliton remains bound since @xmath80 . at @xmath81",
    "mev the condition is no longer fulfilled and no bound solution exists beyond this point . between these two values",
    "the energy of the soliton differs only little from the energy of three free quarks .",
    "the soliton is weakly bound ; the chiral field stays close to its vacuum value while the soliton radius is large .    ' '' ''    height 0pt depth 0pt",
    "it is well known that the njl model can be transformed into the form of an equivalent linear @xmath0-model .",
    "this transformation is explained in @xcite , chapter 5 .",
    "if one assumes a sharp cut - off and sufficiently large @xmath43 ( compared to @xmath39 ) the lagrangian density of the equivalent @xmath0-model takes the familiar form @xmath82 the fields @xmath0 and @xmath83 are related to the two components of the chiral field of the bosonized njl model as @xmath84 , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 and the mass of the @xmath0 meson are related to the parameters of the njl model by here is a factor 2 smaller than the one in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 the question remains whether the above assumptions are met in the model described in section 2 .",
    "is close to 1 while the smooth form of the regulator may and does generate additional terms in the lagrangian ( [ elsm - fam ] ) and modifies the values of the parameters .",
    "a work that will take into account the additional terms is in progress .",
    "the conclusions in this section remain valid but the results should be considered only as qualitative . ]",
    "we assume that the lagrangian ( [ elsm - fam ] ) describes the sea quarks while the valence quarks are treated separately .",
    "this is in the spirit of the approaches used in @xcite .",
    "however , in all these approaches the valence orbit is not regularized and  as we shall see in this section  this brings a qualitative difference with respect to the situation where it is regularized . if we agree that a regulator in the quark - quark or , equivalently , quark - chiral field interaction has a well grounded physical origin , the valence orbit should be regularized in the same way as the orbits in the dirac sea .",
    "the valence orbit is determined as in ( [ eval ] ) .",
    "the soliton energy then becomes ( @xmath91 ) : @xmath92    + g \\left [ \\sigma j^\\sigma + \\pi_a j_a^\\pi \\right ]                                                        \\right )    + e_{s.i.}\\;,\\ ] ] where the meson self - interaction term ( the `` mexican hat '' ) is given by @xmath93 here we have introduced the source terms which explicitly contain the regulator ( see ( [ sceq ] ) ) : @xmath94 the mean - field solution is obtained by solving the self - consistency equations ( the hedgehog ansatz @xmath95 and @xmath96 is assumed ) : @xmath97\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left({\\d^2\\over\\d r^2 } + { 2\\over r}\\,{\\d\\over\\d r } - { 2\\over r^2 } - m_\\pi^2\\right)\\pi(r )    = j^\\pi_a(\\vec{r})\\hat{r}_a +    \\lambda^2\\left [    { \\sigma'(r)}^2 + 2f_\\pi{\\sigma'(r ) } + \\pi(r)^2\\right]\\pi(r)\\;.       \\label{sigmaeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in figures  [ figelsm ] and [ mflsm ] we compare the properties of the soliton when the valence orbit is regularized and when it is not .",
    "close to the threshold the two solutions do not differ much  as it should be  since here the cut - off @xmath43 is relatively large . for higher values of @xmath39 ( or @xmath98 )",
    "the behavior is qualitatively quite different ; in particular , the energy of the unregularized valence orbit soon becomes negative which never happens for the regularized one .",
    "let us finally mention why the regularization is important also in the linear @xmath0-model with only valence quarks . even if there is no instability as in the regularized linear @xmath0-model - propagator @xcite .",
    "] , one encounters serious difficulties when going beyond the mean field approximation . in the @xmath0-model it is possible to use the peierls - yoccoz projection of good linear momentum , spin and isospin in order to obtain physical nucleon states .",
    "it turns out that the energy of the soliton after projection is strongly reduced already when the mean - field solution is used for the chiral fields @xcite .",
    "if in addition one allows a variation of the chiral field profiles , one obtains a solution with an energy considerably lower than the nucleon mass .",
    "the energy gain is mostly due to a strongly localized chiral field which lowers the valence energy .",
    "such a strong localization is not allowed when the regulator is used since it puts a physical limit on the gradients of the field ( through the source term ( [ source ] ) ) ."
