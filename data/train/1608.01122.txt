    ". there have also been attempts to characterize and quantify quantumness in a macroscopic sense @xcite . several general measures for quantifying such _",
    "quantum macroscopicity _ have been suggested in recent studies @xcite .",
    "however , those measures tend to operate within quite different contexts such as interference in the phase space @xcite , usefulness for quantum metrology @xcite , and the minimal modification of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a resource theory of quantum coherence has recently been proposed @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the amount of quantum coherence could be quantified as a physical resource to achieve tasks beyond classical types of resources . in this viewpoint",
    ", recent studies have discovered connections between quantum coherence and other fields of resource theory , including quantum correlation @xcite and quantum thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , an axiomatic approach towards macroscopic quantum coherence was suggested @xcite and several existing measures @xcite were investigated based on it .    in this paper",
    ", we suggest a measure of macroscopic coherence based on the state disturbance induced by a coarse - grained measurement .",
    "we show that the disturbance - based measure satisfies the recently proposed criteria of macroscopic coherence @xcite , but in some cases can not yield consistent results without additional constraints .",
    "this problem is overcome in our study by introducing coarse - graining of the measurement depending on the system size .",
    "we also prove an inequality which relates the wigner - yanase - dyson skew information ( and consequently the quantum fisher information ) and the state disturbance induced by coarse - grained measurement , from which we argue that an appropriate limit to yield a consistent measure is the classical limit .",
    "our operational viewpoint on quantum macroscopicity allows one to effectively identify the quantum coherence between the macroscopically - separated components of a superposition .",
    "our approach can be well applied to both spin and bosonic systems , and we present several examples that lead to reasonable results .",
    "we first review some preliminary concepts regarding macroscopic quantum coherence . let us consider a measurement observable described by a hermitian operator @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenstates of the observable @xmath1 defines a natural orthonormal basis @xmath2 , which can be used to quantify the amount of coherence in the system .",
    "previous measures of quantum coherence @xcite give the same value for every superposition in the form of @xmath3 , without any regard for physical measurement outcomes represented by components @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "in other words , they did not consider how correctly @xmath4 and @xmath5 are discriminated by an actual measurement . in an attempt to quantify macroscopic quantum coherence however",
    ", we should give some consideration to the outcomes of a physical measurement .",
    "recently , yadin and vedral proposed @xcite a set of conditions that should be satisfied by a proper measure of macroscopic coherence . in their proposed resource theory of macroscopic coherence , the free operation @xmath8 is characterized as an operation satisfying the condition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 . with respect to this set of free operations",
    ", they proposed that any reasonable measure of macroscopic quantum coherence @xmath11 should satisfy the following conditions : ( m1 ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 _ if and only if _ @xmath14 .",
    "( m2a ) it is non - increasing under any trace - preserving free operation , @xmath15 .",
    "( m2b ) it is non - increasing under any selective free operation , @xmath16 for @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "( m3 ) it is convex , @xmath19 .",
    "( m4 ) @xmath20 if @xmath21 , which indicates that the coherence between distant modes are weighed more heavily than modes that are close to each other .",
    "known examples of measures that satisfy these conditions are the quantum fisher information and wigner - yanase - dyson skew information @xcite .",
    "we say that macroscopic coherence is coherence of a quantum superposition between two macroscopically distinct states .",
    "in other words , the component states of the superposition are supposed to yield two distinct outcomes when a measurement on a macroscopic scale is performed .",
    "we may employ the concept of a coarse - grained measurement @xcite to describe such a macroscopic measurement . in order to construct a coarse - grained measurement ,",
    "we first define a smoothing function @xmath22 $ ] , where @xmath23 is a continuous variable over the real line .",
    "a natural choice for the smoothing function @xmath24 is a gaussian distribution centered around measurement outcome @xmath6 .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath25 determines the level of precision of the measurement and therefore quantifies the amount of coarse graining of the measurement .",
    "a _ coarse grained measurement _",
    "is then defined to be the following set of kraus operators : @xmath26 one may interpret the above measurement as an interaction with the needle of a measuring apparatus that returns a normal distribution about the position @xmath6 when the system is in the space projected by @xmath27 . if @xmath28 , the measurement process becomes projective , while an increasing @xmath25 implies an increasingly imprecise measurement process .",
    "one may verify that @xmath29 for any @xmath30 so it is indeed a valid positive - operator valued measurement ( povm ) . in such a case , the post measurement state is given by @xmath31 .      in this section ,",
    "we show that the measurement disturbance caused by a coarse - grained measurement naturally leads to a measure of macroscopic coherence .",
    "when one performs a non - selective projective ( i.e. precise ) measurement on the state with the given measurement basis set , all coherence terms between eigenstates of the different measurement outcomes will vanish .",
    "however , when a coarse - grained measurement is performed , certain coherence terms may survive depending on the precision of the measurement .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that at a certain level of the measurement precision , only macroscopic coherence will be disturbed by the measurement process . towards this end ,",
    "we propose the disturbance of the quantum state induced by the coarse grained measurement process as a natural measure of macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "remarkably , despite starting from considerably different physical arguments , the following theorem demonstrates that the measurement disturbance satisfy the set of conditions proposed by yadin and vedral @xcite .",

    "the bures distance measure is defined in terms of fidelity between quantum states @xmath38 ^ 2 $ ] and the quantum relative entropy is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "details and proof can be found in the appendix .",
    "for the rest of the paper , we assume that the measure @xmath40 is based on the bures distance @xmath41 .",
    "theorem  [ ms ] allows us to define a new family of macroscopic quantum coherence measures parametrized by the measurement precision @xmath25 .",
    "we notice that the disturbance - based measure @xmath40 with certain values of @xmath25 leads to obviously unreasonable results although it satisfies all the conditions in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the following example shows that a product of microscopic superpositions has a larger value of @xmath42 than the ghz - state when @xmath25 is sufficiently small .",
    "this is contrary to our understanding and previous results @xcite that the latter state is clearly in a macroscopic superposition while the former is not .    consider a magnetization measurement on a system of @xmath43 spin-@xmath44 particles , of the same type studied by poulin  @xcite .",
    "the measurement is defined by a hermitian operator @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the standard pauli z operator .",
    "the observable @xmath48 represents a collective measurement of the overall spins rather than addressing each individual spin .",
    "the fidelity between the pre- and post measurement states for @xmath43-particle product states @xmath49 with @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 using the approximation of the binomial distribution to the normal distribution for @xmath52 .",

    "[ spin ] ) .",
    "the result clearly demonstrates that the conditions proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite are not sufficient to prescribe a completely consistent measure of macroscopic coherence .     for measuring total magnetization of @xmath43 spin-1/2 system with @xmath61 .",
    "a product state ( dot - dashed line ) , a ghz - state ( double - dot - dashed line ) , and @xmath62-rotated dicke states ( solid lines ) are investigated .",
    "upper line on rotated dicke states ( shaded region ) refers to @xmath63 , while lower line refers to @xmath64 .",
    "dashed lines refer to the bound given by eq .",
    "( [ ieq3 ] ) . ]",
    "in order to overcome the issues described in the previous section , we revisit to the basic premise of macroscopic quantumness . as far back as schrdinger @xcite ,",
    "a system is said to be macroscopic quantum when each state constructing superposition is distinguished directly by a classical measurement .    in metrology",
    ", it is well known that the limit of a classical measurement is given by @xmath65 for @xmath43-particle systems , and quantum resources are necessary to achieve higher efficiencies .",
    "previous studies of coarse - grained measurement similarly argued that the condition @xmath66 allows macroscopic observables to be considered classical @xcite .",
    "the following theorem relating our disturbance - based measure @xmath67 to the wigner - yanase - dyson skew information @xmath68 ^ 2 $ ] further reinforces our argument .",
    "[ skewinfo ] coarse - grained measurement disturbance @xmath67 is lower bounded by wigner - yanase - dyson skew information @xmath69 , @xmath70 for a pure state @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the variance of the observable @xmath1 , which is identical to @xmath74 for a pure state .    the above inequality well represents the intuition that the more precise the measurements and the more coherence present within the system , the more the measurement will disturb the quantum state .",
    "this inequality relates previous studies @xcite using the variance as quantum macroscopicity to a coarse - grained measurement @xcite .",
    "previous study @xcite have argued that the scaling of the quantum fisher information with the number of particles @xmath43 characterizes whether a @xmath43-particle system is macroscopically quantum .",
    "moreover , the wigner - yanase - dyson skew information is a closely related with the quantum fisher information by the following relation @xcite @xmath75 where the quantum fisher information is given by @xmath76 for eigendecomposition of @xmath77 . according to the argument on macroscopic quantumness @xcite , quantum states with @xmath78 can be interpreted as classical(or at least microscopic quantum ) while the states with @xmath79 may be considered macroscopic quantum .",
    "theorem  [ skewinfo ] naturally manifests itself in the disturbance - based measure .",
    "provided the level of coarse graining is chosen to be @xmath65 , a state with @xmath78 will result in a measurement disturbance close to zero .",
    "for example , the macroscopic coherence for a product of microscopic quantum states @xmath80 is close to zero according to our measure , since the wigner - yanase - dyson skew information scales with the order of @xmath81 .",
    "in contrast , a non - classical skew information @xmath79 , for example in the case of a ghz state , allows the measure @xmath82 to reach its maximum value of @xmath58 for @xmath52 .",
    "this observation allows us to circumvent the inconsistency observed in the previous section .",
    "we will therefore impose the classical limit @xmath83 as the appropriate level of coarse graining for our disturbance based measure .",
    "another example in the spin system is a rotated dicke state given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a sum overall all symmetric permutations @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the rotation operator with @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in the case of @xmath90 and @xmath91 ,",
    "the macroscopic coherence of the state depends on the excitation number @xmath92 .",
    "such a state approaches being a product state(or a spin - coherent state ) when @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "figure  [ spin ] compares the behavior of @xmath95 between rotated dicke , ghz and product states for varying levels of the coarse graining parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we also observe that at the classical limit of @xmath83 , rotated dicke states with excitation number @xmath96 result in higher levels of macroscopic coherence @xmath97 than the ghz - state .",
    "this property does not persist however , if we were to continue decreasing the amount of measurement precision ( i.e. increase @xmath25 ) . for a sufficiently large @xmath25",
    ", the ghz - state tends to have the highest level of macroscopic coherence among all the states considered .",
    "our disturbance - based measure appears to capture ideas from both the more general quantum coherence measures given by ref .",
    "@xcite and the macroscopic coherence measures based on the variance of the observable @xcite since it encodes information about _ how many states are currently in superposition _ as well as _ how far apart these superposed states are _ with respect to the given measurement observable and the measurement precision @xmath25 .     for quadrature measurement for bosonic system with the same mean particle number @xmath98 .",
    "a fock state ( dot - dashed line ) , a superposition of coherent states ( double - dot - dashed line ) , and a coherent state ( solid line ) are investigated .",
    "dashed lines refer to the bound given by eq .",
    "( [ ieq3 ] ) . ]",
    "we also apply the disturbance - based measure to bosonic systems described by the annihilation operator @xmath99 and the creation operator @xmath100 .",
    "since a bosonic system can contain many particles in a single mode , the system may be considered macroscopic when the mean particle number @xmath101 is large . in this case , the particle number @xmath102 and the quadrature @xmath103 are natural candidates for measurement observables .",
    "we now consider the value of @xmath95 with respect to an @xmath104-quadrature measurement @xmath105 .",
    "figure [ boson ] shows the disturbance - based measure @xmath95 for typical states of a bosonic system .",
    "again , we see that for small values of @xmath25 , the coherent state @xmath106 contains non - trivial macroscopic quantumness , which is against physical intuition",
    ". however , @xmath95 rapidly decreases with @xmath25 and becomes essentially zero at the imposed classical limit of @xmath107 . in comparison , a superposition of coherent states(scs ) @xmath108 and the fock state @xmath109 give non - trivial values of @xmath95 at the classical limit of @xmath25 .",
    "all these observations are compatible with the common expectation that coherent states are classical , while scs and the fock states are considered macroscopically quantum .",
    "we proposed a disturbance - based measure of macroscopic coherence through coarse grained - measurements .",
    "our argument stems from physical grounds that a precise measurement will affect all the coherence present in the system , while a sufficiently imprecise measurement will affect only the portion of the coherence between classically distinct states .",
    "we demonstrate that our disturbance - based measure satisfies a series of properties to quantify macroscopic coherence laid out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the process , we point out that conditions for macroscopic coherence proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite is insufficient to yield consistent results without additional constraints .",
    "this inconsistency can be overcome by fixing the level of coarse - graining to an appropriate classical limit given by the classical limit @xmath83 .",
    "we also demonstrate an inequality relating the measurement - induced disturbance and wigner - yanase - dyson skew information and argue that the this kind of classical limit is necessary to produce a reliable measure of macroscopic coherence .",
    "we emphasize that the proposed measure provides an operational point of view on macroscopic quantumness that can be quantified by the degree of disturbance throughout the measurement of a given imprecision .",
    "the imprecision of the measurement allows us to focus on the coherence between macroscopically distinct states by blurring the interference below the measurement resolution",
    ". we can thus identify whether the quantum state is in a macroscopic superposition by investigating the state disturbance throughout the measurement only with a macroscopic resolution .",
    "as we have demonstrated for both spin and bosonic systems , our approach is not limited to a specific quantum system but can be applied to arbitrary macroscopic observables and quantum systems with large particle numbers .",
    "we expect that the viewpoint concerning the state disturbance induced by coarse - grained measurement may lead to greater insights on macroscopic quantum effects and coherence .",
