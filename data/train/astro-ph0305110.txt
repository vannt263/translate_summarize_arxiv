    "the first high - precision radial velocity survey for planetary companions to nearby stars was conducted with the use of a hf gas absorption cell on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( campbell & walker 1979 ; walker et al .",
    "the @xmath0  cephei system ( hr  8974 = hd  222404 = hip  116727 ) was one of 16 stars on the observing list of this program .",
    "campbell , walker , & yang ( 1988 ) reported that two of the stars on the observing list ( @xmath0  cephei and @xmath8  orionis ) were previously unknown single - lined spectroscopic binaries . in the case of @xmath0  cephei , campbell ,",
    "walker , & yang ( 1988 ) found evidence for radial velocity `` bumps '' superimposed on the large amplitude binary motion .",
    "the residuals after removing the binary orbit yielded a period of about 2.7  years and a velocity semiamplitude of about 25ms@xmath1 .",
    "the authors examined several possible causes of the observed radial velocity variability , and finally concluded that the system had a `` probable third body . ''",
    "if substantiated , this would have been the first detection of an extrasolar planetary system . however , bohlender , irwin , & yang ( 1992 ) classified @xmath0  cep as a k0  iii star , raising the possibility that the observed radial velocity variations were due to the recently discovered ( walker et al .",

    "they also found evidence of a possible variation of the ca  ii @xmath28662 emission line index with the same 2.5 year period , leading them to conclude that the observed low - amplitude radial velocity variation was most likely due to k - giant variability at the period of the stellar rotation .",
    "here we present new high - precision radial velocity data on the @xmath0  cephei system obtained from mcdonald observatory . when combined with the cfht data ,",
    "we show that the 2.5-year low - amplitude radial velocity variability of @xmath0  cep has remained constant for over 20 years .",
    "a simultaneous orbital solution for both the binary star and the 2.5-year low amplitude variability is computed .",
    "we demonstrate that there is no correlation between the low - amplitude radial velocity variations and the mt .",
    "wilson ca  ii s - index , nor is there any indication of photospheric absorption line profile variability .",
    "these results , combined with the current best classification of @xmath0  cep as a k1iv star ( fuhrmann 2003 ) , all indicate that the preferred interpretation of the data is that @xmath0  cep  a has a planetary - mass companion in a 2.5  year period orbit .",
    "we consider four independent sets of high precision radial velocity data for @xmath0  cephei , covering the interval from 1981 through 2002 .",
    "the first of these is from the cfht survey campbell , walker , & yang ( 1988 ) , walker et al . ( 1995 ) , with the velocities taken from table  1 of walker et al . ( 1992 ) .",
    "all of the other data were from the mcdonald observatory planetary search ( mops ) program ( cochran & hatzes 2000 ) .",
    "phase  i of the mops program used the telluric o@xmath9 lines near 6300 as the velocity metric , a technique suggested by griffin & griffin ( 1973 ) .",
    "a single order of the 2.7 m coud spectrometer 6-foot camera with the echelle grating was isolated onto a texas instruments ( ti ) @xmath10 ccd at @xmath11 .",
    "this system gave 1520ms@xmath1 precision on stars down to about @xmath12 , but suffered from systematic velocity errors , most likely due to prevailing atmospheric winds . in 1992",
    "the program switched to a temperature stabilized i@xmath9 cell ( koch & whl 1984 ; libbrecht 1988 ) as the velocity metric for phase  ii of the mops ( @xmath11 for this data as well ) .",
    "this eliminated the systematic errors , and gave a routine radial velocity precision of 15ms@xmath1 .",
    "this precision was limited by the 9.6 bandpass of the spectrum , and by the poor charge - transfer and readout properties of the ti ccd . to solve these problems , and to achieve substantially improved precision , we began phase  iii of the radial velocity program in july 1998 , using the i@xmath9 cell with the newly installed 2dcoud cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph ( tull et al .",
    "this instrument when used with a tektronix 2048@xmath132048 detector provides a nominal wavelength coverage of 3600 ",
    "1@xmath14 m at a resolving power of @xmath15 .",
    "the tektronix ccd also had significantly better charge transfer and readout properties than the ti device .",
    "the complete spectral coverage of 2dcoud gives us two advantages : first , we can utilize the full reference spectrum of the i@xmath9-cell for the rv determination and second , we can simultaneously determine the stellar chromospheric emission in the cores of the caii  h&k lines to use as stellar chromospheric activity indicators .",
    "we will discuss in detail the question whether there is a correlation between the rv - results and the activity indices for @xmath0  cep in section  4 .    to extract the rv - information from the i@xmath9 self - calibrated spectra taken during phase",
    "iii we employed our @xmath16 rv - code , which uses a maximum entropy method deconvolution in order to obtain a higher resolved stellar template spectrum and several reconstruction algorithms which model the shape and symmetry of the instrumental profile ( ip ) at the time of observation .",
    "a detailed description of the @xmath16 code can be found in endl , krster , & els ( 2000 ) .",

    "( 1995 ) . using the 2dcoud spectrometer in i@xmath9-cell self - calibration mode and the @xmath16 code for the analysis",
    ", we obtain a long term rv precision of @xmath17 on a routine basis for stars down to a magnitude of @xmath18 .",
    "all of the mops data from phases i , ii and iii are given in tables 13 .",
    "the uncertainties quoted there for phase ii and iii data are the `` internal '' errors , as represented by the rms of the individual spectral chunks about the mean value .",
    "we regard these as a lower limit on the actual uncertainties , since these values do not include the effects of any residual systematic errors that may be present .",
    "it is difficult to estimate internal errors for the phase  i data because these are not analyzed in `` chunks '' like the phase ii and iii measurements .",
    "phase  i observations of a constant star ( @xmath19 cet ) show an rms scatter of 23 ms@xmath1 .",
    "the rms scatter of the phase i measurements about the final orbital solution is 17.4ms@xmath1 .",
    "we list a slightly higher value of 19 ms@xmath1 as the `` error '' of the phase i measurements in table 1 .",
    "this error was the most reasonable error to assign based upon @xmath20 tests of the data and was the value assumed for the phase  i measurements in the final orbital solutions .",
    "the true error for an individual phase i measurement is almost surely higher due to different signal - to - noise ratios of individual spectra and systematic errors due to wind and temperature and pressure changes in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the rv measurements for all data sets are shown in figure  [ orbit ] .",
    "a different velocity offset ( see below ) had to be applied to each data set so that they would all have the same zero point .",
    "one can clearly see that the `` wiggles '' superimposed on the binary variations , that were first reported by walker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) are still present in the final data set ( phase iii ) taken 20 years later .",
    "figure  [ periodogram ] shows a sequence of lomb - scargle periodograms ( lomb 1976 , scargle 1982 ) of the rv measurements after subtraction of the velocity variations due to the binary companion ( see below ) .",
    "the top panel is only for the cfht data .",
    "the central panel is for the cfht + mcdonald data , excluding the phase iii data .",
    "the lower panel is the periodogram for all of the rv measurements .",
    "the increase in power at a period of @xmath21 2.5 yrs with the addition of each data set is the first indication that these residual rv variations are long - lived and coherent .",
    "( the false alarm probability of the peak for the full dataset is @xmath21 10@xmath22 ) .",
    "the program _ gaussfit _ ( jefferys et al . 1988 ; mcarthur et al . 1994 ) was used to fit simultaneously all orbital parameters , both for the stellar and the presumed sub - stellar companion , using nonlinear least squares with robust estimation . because each instrument produces relative radial velocities with their own arbitrary zero point , the individual velocity offsets were a free parameter in the least squares solution .",
    "table  [ offsets ] gives the velocity offsets of the different data sets .",
    "subtracting these velocity offsets from an individual data sets will place them all on the same radial velocity scale .",

    "the errors listed are the correlated errors that are produced by _",
    "gaussfit_. the largest error occurs in the period since our observations span about 20 years , or about one - third of the binary orbit .",
    "note that the reduced @xmath20 of the binary `` only '' orbital solution is rather large ( 4.36 ) indicating the presence of additional rv variations .",
    "griffin et al . ( 2002 ) presented an orbital solution for the stellar companion to @xmath0 cep .",
    "they combined radial velocity measurements spanning over 100 years taken at five observatories .",
    "these measurements included the cfht data as well as some of our mcdonald observatory measurements ( read from an enlarged copy of a published graph ! ) .",
    "the parameters of their orbital solution is also listed in table  [ binorbit ] . in spite of the more limited time span of our observations",
    "our orbital solution agrees quite well with the griffin et al .",
    "table  [ planorbit ] lists the _",
    "orbital parameters for the sub - stellar companion .",
    "also listed is the rms scatter of the individual datasets about the combined orbital solution .",
    "the period of 2.48 years and semi - amplitude of 27.5 ms@xmath1 are consistent with the values found by walker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) using only the cfht data set .",
    "note that the reduced @xmath20 is significantly lower ( @xmath20 = 1.47 ) when including the planet in the orbital solution .",
    "fuhrmann ( 2003 ) estimates the primary mass of @xmath0  cep as @xmath3 @xmath7 1.59 @xmath23 0.12 @xmath24 .",
    "this results in a planetary mass of @xmath25 @xmath26@xmath4 @xmath7 1.7 @xmath23 0.4 @xmath5 and an orbital semimajor axis of 2.13 au .",
    "figure  [ phase ] shows the phase diagram of the individual data sets .",
    "the phase , amplitude , and overall shape of the rv curves hold up remarkably well over a 20 year time span , again evidence for long - lived and coherent variations that are consistent with the presence of a planetary companion .",
    "the question naturally arises as to whether some phenomena instrinsic to the star ( spots , convective shifts , pulsations ) are responsible for the 2.48 yr period .",
    "after all , @xmath0  cep is most likely a subgiant ( see below ) , a class of stars for which magnetic activity , surface structure , convection , and pulsations are poorly known .",
    "moreover , walker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) did find evidence for weak periodic variations in the equivalent width of the ca ii @xmath28662 line with the same period as the planet . in spite of the intrinsic variability of giant stars planetary companions",
    "have been found around other giant stars ( frink et al 2002 ; setiawan et al .",
    "2003 ) and one subgiant ( butler et al .",
    "so planets around giant evolved stars is not an unreasonable hypothesis . before concluding that the planet hypothesis is the most likely explanation for the residual rv variations we must demonstrate that @xmath0  cep does not exhibit any significant variations with the planet period in other quantities . here we examine whether @xmath0  cep also has spectral and photometric variations .",
    "the spectral line shapes can also provide evidence in support of the planetary hypothesis .",
    "surface features ( hatzes 2002 ) or nonradial pulsations ( hatzes 1996 , brown et al .",
    "1998 ) should produce changes in the spectral line shapes with the same period as the rv variations .",
    "a convenient means of measuring the asymmetry of a spectral line is the line bisector , or the line segments connecting the midpoints of the spectral line from the core to the continuum .",
    "line bisector studies have been used to establish the planetary nature of 51 peg ( hatzes , cochran , & johns - krull 1997 ; hatzes , cochran , & bakker 1998a , b ) and the starspot nature of the planet - like rv variations in hd 166435 ( queloz et al . 2001 ) .    the mcdonald observatory phase i observations taken in the 6300  region provide an excellent data set for studying possible line profile variations in @xmath0  cep .",
    "the data has very high spectral resolution ( @xmath27 = 210,000 ) and there are several strong spectral lines that were velocity shifted clear of the telluric features because of the earth s barycentric velocity .",
    "the fe i @xmath26301.5  feature was free of telluric lines over the entire data set , fe i @xmath26297.8 for 30 observations , and fe i @xmath26302.5  for 8 observations . both the bisector velocity span and curvature were measured for these lines .",
    "the velocity span is defined as the velocity difference between two arbitrary points on the line bisector while the curvature is the difference between the velocity span of the top half of the bisector minus the velocity span of the lower half of the bisector .",
    "a 5th order polynomial was fit to each measured line bisector and the velocity span points taken at 0.4 and 0.8 of the continuum .",
    "( in measuring the line bisector one should avoid both the core and the continuum where the errors in the bisector measurement become large . ) the additional point required for the curvature measurements was taken at 0.6 of the continuum value .",
    "the mean value of the bisector span and curvature for each line was then subtracted from the individual measurements and the residual span and velocity measurements were then averaged , weighted by the rms scatter of the bisector measurements for each spectral line .",
    "figure  [ bisector ] shows the phase - binned averages ( @xmath28 @xmath21 0.05 ) of the bisector span and curvature variations for @xmath0  cep phased to the planet orbital period .",
    "the short - dashed horizontal line gives the zero - point reference and the long - dashed lines show the velocity extrema of the residual rv variations due to the planetary companion .",
    "there are no obvious phase variations of the bisector quantities with the planet period .",
    "the least squares sine fit to the bisector quantities assuming a period of 906 days yields amplitudes of 4.8 @xmath23 4.4 ms@xmath1 and 2.4 @xmath23 4.5 ms@xmath1 for the bisector and span variations , respectively .",
    "these amplitudes are consistent and are significantly less than the observed 27 ms@xmath1 radial velocity variations of the planet .    the mcdonald phase i data had the largest errors of all the data sets and the phase variations of these show the least evidence for the 906 day period ( fig .",
    "[ phase ] ) .",
    "one could argue that there are no residual rv variations with which to correlate to the bisector measurements .",
    "however , the phase i data is still consistent with the presence of the planet signal .",
    "not only is this signal present in the phase i and ii data alone , but the power increases by almost a factor of two over the individual periodograms when the two data sets are combined . although not obvious to the eye , the 906-day period is still present in the phase i data . on the other hand ,",
    "the averaged , phase - binned bisector measurements have variations significantly less than the 906-day rv amplitude and we believe this adds additional evidence ( along with the photometric and ca ii analysis presented below ) in support of the planet hypothesis .",
    "_ if _ the bisector variations had scatter comparable to the rv amplitude , then one could at least make a plausible argument in favor of possible bisector variability .",
    "figure  [ bisector ] excludes that .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ mission ( perryman 1997 ) took high precision photometric measurements of @xmath0  cep contemporaneously with the measurements used for our rv study .",
    "if cool spots on the stellar surface , or some form of stellar pulsations were causing the residual rv variations , then this should be evident in the _ hipparcos _ photometry .",
    "figure  [ photometry ] shows the _ hipparcos _ photometry taken from 1989.9 to 1993.2 phased to the planet orbital period .",
    "crosses represent individual measurements while solid points represent phase - binned averages ( @xmath29 @xmath30 0.05 ) .",
    "error bars represent the rms scatter of the measurements used for each bin .",
    "there are no obvious photometric variations with the planet period as confirmed by a periodogram analysis of the daily averages of the _ hipparcos _ photometry ( figure  [ photft ] ) .",
    "a least squares sine fit to the phased photometric data yields an amplitude of @xmath31 = 0.001 @xmath23 0.0009 mag for any possible photometric variations .",
    "( a fit to the phase - binned measurements yields @xmath31 = 0.0003 . )",
    "the lack of photometric variations in @xmath0  cep is also consistent with the planet hypothesis for the residual rv variations for this star .",
    "stellar activity in @xmath0  cep could induce significant periodic centroid shifts in photospheric absorption lines which could be confused for perturbations made by planetary companions ( saar & donahue 1997 ; saar & fischer 2000 , queloz et al .",
    "2001 ) . for the phase iii data an instrumental setup was chosen so as to include the ca ii h and k lines on the detector . to measure stellar chromospheric activity , the mt .",
    "wilson @xmath32 index was adopted .",
    "this index is defined ( e.g. baliunas et al .",
    "1992 ) as a quantity proportional to the sum of the flux in 1 fwhm triangular bandpasses centered on the ca ii h and k lines divided by the sum of the flux in 20 bandpasses in the continuum at 3901 and 4001 ( soderblom , duncan , & johnson 1991 ) .",
    "the four quantities to be measured ( the two calcium line core fluxes plus the two continuum bandpass fluxes ) are spread across 3 echelle spectral orders which overlap by several  . in order to be consistent with activity monitoring with our other programs ( paulson et al .",
    "2002 ) , we did not use measurements in the bluemost order , i.e. the continuum region centered on 3901 .",
    "in addition , we did not measure the ca ii h line ( at 3968.47 ) because the wings of strong balmer h@xmath33 feature ( at 3970.07 ) are within the measured ca ii bandpass .",
    "this can adversely affect the measurement of the ca ii h line flux .",
    "therefore , we have defined an index @xmath34 which is the ratio of the flux in a 1 triangular bandpass centered on the ca ii k line to the flux in a 20 bandpass centered on the redward continuum at 4001   .",

    "we are thus able to transform our data into a standard mt .",
    "wilson @xmath32 index scale using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the periodogram of the s - index measurements ( figure  [ sindexft ] ) shows no significant power at the orbital frequency of the planet .",
    "the false alarm probability of the highest peak , assessed using a bootstrap randomization process ( murdoch et al . 1993 ; krster et al .",
    "1997 ) , is 50% .",
    "the lack of variability at the planet period is substantiated by phasing these variations to the 906 day period ( figure  [ sindex ] ) .",
    "clearly no significant sinusoidal variations in this chromospheric index are present . the transformed ca ii k s - index for @xmath0  cep is @xmath385.3 which implies a level of magnetic activity less than that of the sun .      a conclusion regarding the planetary nature of the residual rv variations of @xmath0  cep would not be complete without a discussion of the ca ii variations found by walker et al ( 1992 ) .",

    "( 1992 ) did show a hint of sinusoidal variations when phased to the planetary orbital period .",
    "although this on its own does not completely refute the existence of a planet , having ca ii variations with the same period would cast more doubt on this hypothesis . for these reasons we made a careful examination the significance of the ca ii variations reported by walker et al .",

    "the fraction of the periodograms having power higher than the data periodogram in the range 0.0005 @xmath30 @xmath44 @xmath30 0.01 cd@xmath1 is the false alarm probability that noise would create the detected signal .",

    "fuhrmann s classification of k1iv for @xmath0 cep is consistent with the sub - giant status for @xmath50 cep ( k0iv ) which has a comparable effective temperature ( 4990 k ) , gravity ( log @xmath51 = 3.4 ) , radius ( 4.14 @xmath52 ) , and bolometric magnitude ( @xmath53 = 2.3 ) .",
    "the most current and best analysis of @xmath0 cep supports this being a subgiant star .",
    "the long time - baseline of rv - monitoring of @xmath0  cep and the emergence of several multiple extrasolar planetary systems from doppler surveys ( e.g. butler et al .",
    "1999 ) , encouraged us to search for additional companions in this system .",
    "for this purpose we performed a period search within the rv - residuals , after subtracting both the binary orbital motion and the first planetary signal .",
    "[ residper ] shows the lomb - scargle periodogram of the rv - residuals in the period range of @xmath54 to @xmath55 days ( frequency = 0.00013  0.5 cd@xmath1 ) .",
    "the strongest peak is found at @xmath56 days but its significance level is very low ( false - alarm - probability ( fap ) is @xmath57 ) .",
    "the fap - levels shown in the figure were determined by @xmath58 runs of a bootstrap randomization scheme .",
    "it is clear from this analysis that no additional periodic signal above the noise level is present in the rv - residuals of @xmath0  cep and we thus conclude that the 906-day period planet is the only giant planet in this system evident in our data ..",
    "precise stellar radial velocity measurements of @xmath0  cep from 4 independent data sets spanning over 20 years show long - lived , low - amplitude rv variations ( @xmath59 = 27.5 ms@xmath1 ) superimposed on the larger radial velocity variations due to the reflex motion caused by a stellar companion .",
    "we interpret the low amplitude , shorter period variations as due to the presence of a planetary companion with @xmath3 @xmath26@xmath4 = 1.7 @xmath5 and an orbital semi - major axis , @xmath60 = 2.13 au .",
    "our conclusion that these short period variations are not due to rotation , pulsations , or changes in the convection pattern of the star is based on several facts :    1 .",
    "the 2.48 yr period has been present for over 20 years with no changes in phase or amplitude during this time . 2 .",
    "no variations with this period are seen in the mcdonald ca ii s - index measurements .",
    "spectral line bisector span and curvature measurements for @xmath0   cep that are constant to less than 5 ms@xmath1 over an orbital cycle of the planet .",
    "contemporaneous _ hipparcos _ photometry that is constant to less than 0.001 mag over an orbital cycle .",
    "the periodic variations in the ca ii @xmath28662 found by walker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) were only present during 1986.51992 and are thus most likely not associated with the residual rv variability observed for this star .",
    "the cfht ca ii data do show evidence for long period variability .",
    "although this signal is weakly detected in the full data set , it is much stronger in only the last half of the data set spanning 1986.51992 , and completely absent in the data from 1981  1986.5 .",
    "furthermore , our s - index measurements made during 1997  2003 show no modulation .",
    "if rotational modulation was responsible for the residual rv variations then we would have seen rv amplitude changes . however , the amplitude and phase for the residual rv variations remained constant .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that rotational modulation is the cause of the 906 day period .",
    "furthermore , the best fit period to the long term ca ii variations during 1986.5  1992 is 781 @xmath23 116 days , which is significantly less than the 906 day rv period .",
    "gamma cep shows no ca ii modulation during epochs centered on 1994 and 2000 , and modulation ( 781 day period ) during a time centered on 1989 .",
    "this indicates a possible `` activity cycle '' period of 10  15 years , much longer than the presumed planet period .",
    "our spectral line bisector measurements , which are constant , also support our conclusion that we are not seeing rotational modulation .",
    "one could argue that the residual rv variations are due to changes in the convection pattern in the star and not due to magnetic structure ( plage , spots ) .",
    "for instance , if the ratio of areas of convective , hot rising cells and intergranule , sinking lanes changes with an activity cycle ( in this case with a period of @xmath61 900 days ) , then the amount of convective blue ( red ) shift would change periodically resulting in a measured rv signal .",
    "if the stellar magnetic fields are strong enough to alter the convection pattern of the star , but too weak to cause chromospheric structure , then we would see rv variations without strong variations in the ca ii emission .",
    "however , in this case _ we should also see changes in the spectral line bisectors_. the lack of significant variability in the spectral line bisectors does not support the hypothesis of a changing convection pattern on the star , or a least changes that can influence the rv measurements .",
    "the inclination angle of the rotation axis can be estimated by comparing the expected equatorial rotational velocity to the projected rotational velocity ( vsin@xmath4 ) , assuming that 781 days ( period of the ca ii @xmath28662 variations ) is the true rotation period of @xmath0  cep .",
    "fuhrmann ( 2003 ) estimates a radius @xmath27 = 4.66 @xmath52 which gives an equatorial rotational velocity of 4.9 kms@xmath1 .",
    "we have measured a vsin@xmath4 @xmath7 1.5 @xmath23 1.0 kms@xmath1 which is consistent to the value determined by fuhrmann ( 2003 ) .",
    "this yields a sin@xmath4 = 0.5  0.1 . assuming that the orbital and rotation axis of the star is aligned , the true mass for the planetary companion to @xmath0  cep is @xmath21 316 @xmath5 .",
    "given that the 906-day rv variations are due to a sub - stellar companion , the question arises whether this system is stable .",
    "after all , both the planet and the stellar companion have modestly eccentric orbits .",
    "preliminary indications are that this system is indeed stable ( dvorak et al .",
    "( the study by dvorak et al . was made prior to the publication of our paper and it used preliminary orbital parameters published only in conference abstracts .",
    "the stability analysis should be re - done using the final parameters and error estimates we have presented here . )",
    "the @xmath0  cep system presents a very interesting system for the study of planet formation .",
    "planets have been found around host stars that are in a binary system , but these are widely separated pairs so the presence of the stellar companion may not have an influence on the planet formation around one of the stars .",
    "the @xmath0  cep binary is the shortest period binary for which a planetary companion has been found in orbit around one of the components .",
    "this implies that even in such a relatively close binary the presence of the stellar companion does not hinder the process of planet formation .    one final comment .",
    "rv surveys have had a stunning success at finding planets in orbit around other stars . yet",
    "this is still an indirect detection method with the disadvantage that various stellar phenomenon can mimic a planetary signal .",
    "rv searches for extrasolar planets are , and should continue to be a careful process with many candidates undergoing the painstaking process of confirmation .",
    "several extrasolar planet candidates have a proved to be due to stellar phenomena ( queloz et al .",
    "2001 ; butler et al .",
    "2002 ) and more false detections will undoubtedly be uncovered in the future .",
    "likewise , radial velocity variations that were initially attributed to stellar phenomena in the past may ultimately prove to be due to a planetary companion , as is apparently the case for @xmath0  cep .",
    "rv searches for extrasolar planets must be accompanied by careful studies of the host star and the measurement of a various photometric and spectroscopic ( ca ii emission , line shapes ) quantities .",
    "these measurements are important for they could have confirmed the planet around @xmath0  cep seven years prior to the discovery of 51 peg b.    this material is based upon work supported by the national aeronautics and space administration under grant nag5 - 9227 issued through the office of space science , and by national science foundation grant ast9808980 .",
