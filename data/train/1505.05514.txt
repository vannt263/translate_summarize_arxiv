    "the transition between these two orientations happens rapidly at the so - called  laplace radius \" @xmath33 , obtained by setting @xmath34 , and is given by @xmath35 fig .",

    "this means that the plane normal to @xmath42 , where the equilibrium orientation vector @xmath27 lives , is slowly rotating ( fig .",

    "note that @xmath45 in the companion - dominated regime , and @xmath46 in the binary - dominated regime .",
    "this means that the precession of @xmath18 is always slow enough for @xmath16 to adiabatically follow .",
    "in other words , the classical laplace equilibrium formalism remains valid in the frame corotating with @xmath18 , and the three vectors @xmath18 , @xmath23 and @xmath27 remain coplanar at all times .",
    "since the evolution is adiabatic , if @xmath16 starts parallel to @xmath27 , it will remain parallel to the evolving @xmath27 at later times , provided that this equilibrium orientation is a stable solution @xcite .    as studied by @xcite , when @xmath47 , circular orbits on the laplace surface are unstable to linear perturbations in the planet s eccentricity vector @xmath17 vector for a range of @xmath20 around @xmath33 .",
    "this instability manifests itself as an exponential growth of @xmath48 , until non - linear effects come into play , resulting in erratic behavior in both inclination and eccentricity .",
    "this means that above this critical value of @xmath29 , planets can not be placed at @xmath39 , since the resulting high eccentricities could bring them too close to the binary , at which point they may collide with the central stars or be ejected from the system [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "now consider what will happen to the planet s orbit as the inner binary undergoes orbital decay .",
    "for simplicity , let us assume that the binary remains circular during this process , and that the angle @xmath29 remains unchanged . since orbital decay takes place over a time scale @xmath49 much longer than the other relevant time scales ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , the system will evolve adiabatically .",
    "thus , if the planet initially resides in the binary - dominated regime ( @xmath53 , @xmath37 ) , and lives on the laplace surface ( @xmath54 ) , it will transition to the companion - dominated regime ( @xmath55 , @xmath41 ) through the intermediate stage ( @xmath56 ) , as the inner binary s semi - major axis @xmath13 decreases . for a given value of @xmath20 ,",

    "the greatest caveat to the application of classical laplace equilibrium is that the inner binary does not remain circular during orbital decay .",
    "indeed , in the  lk+tide \" mechanism @xcite the inner binary exhibits large oscillations in inclination _ and _ eccentricity under the influence of the external stellar companion .",
    "thus the binary axis @xmath18 not only precesses around @xmath23 , but also undergoes nutation .",

    "this is a good approximation when the companion has zero orbital eccentricity . for general companion eccentricities , octupole and higher - order potentials may introduce more complex dynamical behaviors for the inner binary and for the planet ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "in addition to disk truncation and warping @xcite , planetesimal dynamics in this systems could be affected by the tidal forcing of the inner binary and the outer companion , introducing additional complications to the formation of planetary cores @xcite .",
    "as noted before , currently no planets have been detected around eclipsing compact ( @xmath147  days ) stellar binaries .",
