    "gamma - ray astrophysics in space enormously advanced since the first detection of photons above 100 mev @xcite . the progression of space missions and instruments over the last decades ( oso-3 , sas-2 , cos - b , egret on board of the compton gamma - ray observatory ) led to improvements of the overall detector performance , in terms of both angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "in addition to this , the progressively wider field - of - view ( fov ) allowed a continuous monitoring of the variable gamma - ray sky . following the early cosmic gamma - ray detection by the oso-3 satellite @xcite , the first gamma - ray telescope sas-2 launched in 1972 reached an angular resolution of a few degrees @xcite .",
    "this mission was followed by the european mission cos - b , launched in 1975 august 8 and operational for 7 years @xcite .",
    "the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) , active between 1991 - 2000 , provided the first complete investigation of the gamma - ray sky .",
    "in particular , cgro hosted the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) , operating in the energy range 30 mev - 30 gev @xcite .",
    " pre-_agile_/pre-_fermi _ space instruments were mostly based on spark chamber technology .",
    "further improvements to the overall performance of gamma - ray detectors in space became possible with the advent of solid - state silicon detector technology .",
    "the scientific objectives of the new generation of instruments required the following enhancements : ( 1 ) improving the gamma - ray angular resolution near 100 mev by at least a factor of 2 - 3 compared to egret ; ( 2 ) obtaining the largest possible fov at 100 mev reaching 2.5 - 3 sr ; ( 3 ) increasing flux sensitivity near 100 mev . the current generation of gamma - ray space instruments , _ agile - grid _",
    "( gamma - ray imaging detector ) and _ fermi - lat _ ( large area telescope ) , launched in april 2007 and june 2008 respectively , were designed to achieve these objectives .",
    "both instruments make use of tungsten - silicon detectors for the conversion and detection of gamma - ray photons , having a common overlapping energy range in the @xmath6 mev - 10 gev band @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray detector is structured to form a `` silicon tracker '' made of several trays , each containing a tungsten layer ( used as converter of the incident @xmath7-ray photon into an e@xmath8/e@xmath9 pair ) and two silicon strip layers ( used to track the the e@xmath8/e@xmath9 pair path across the instrument , through their ( x , y ) projections along each tray ) .",
    "the detected tracks are identified and fitted by a kalman filter that allows for the reconstruction of the original direction and energy of the incident photon .",
    "the main source of contamination in the detection of @xmath7-ray photons is then by charged particle tracks , which can be confused with e@xmath8/e@xmath9 pairs .",
    "for this reason , background rejection filters are used both on - board and on - ground , to process the data and obtain a final discrimination and classification of the events .",
    "+ an important parameter in the assessment of the overall instrument scientific performance is the resulting angular resolution , i.e",
    ". the minimum distance at which two close sources are distinguished as separated .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) describes the response of an imaging instrument to a point source and the angular resolution is usually described by either the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the psf radial profile or the 68@xmath10 containment radius ( cr@xmath11 ) of the psf .",
    "key parameters of the instrument configuration affecting the angular resolution of @xmath7-ray solid - state silicon detectors are :     the size of the silicon strips ( the pitch ) and the silicon detector readout system ( e.g. , either digital or analog ) resulting in different effective spatial resolution of the particle trajectory due to charge coupling between adjacent silicon strips ;    the distance between consecutive silicon planes that , combined with the spatial resolution , defines the limiting angular resolution    ;    the thickness of tungsten layers promoting gamma - ray photon conversion , and at the same time inducing multiple scattering that leads to a degradation of the charged particle tracks ;    the reconstruction and event classification algorithms .",
    "table a1 in the appendix summarizes the main characteristics of the _ agile _ and _ fermi _ gamma - ray detectors , whose configurations are different in several ways : the former being optimized in the readout and track reconstruction especially in the low energy band , the latter in terms of converter thickness , geometrical area , and power consumption .",
    "an important difference between the two instruments , that can be crucial for the scientific performance of the instrument , is the readout system ( analog for the _ agile - grid _ and digital for _ fermi - lat _ ) .    in the following sections , we focus on the characterization of the _ agile - grid _ angular resolution both from simulations and from in - flight data . in section [ sec : angres ] we define the parameters that are used across the paper to describe the instrument angular resolution ; section [ sec : simsetup ] describes the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations setup and data processing pipeline ; section [ sec : datasim ] shows the results from the mc simulations ; section [ sec : datacrab ] compares the results of the simulation with the in - flight data angular resolution .",
    "this paper complements the work by @xcite : here we focus on simulations characterizing the overall performance of the _ grid _ instrument and in a special study of crab - like sources , reproducing the behaviour of the majority of detected cosmic gamma - ray sources ; we also present a direct comparison of _ agile _ and _ fermi _ in - flight data for the crab , and discuss the results concerning the angular resolution in terms of the different instrument configurations ( section [ sec : agilevsfermi ] ) , which can be crucial in the study of future missions .",
    "for an imaging telescope , the response in terms of reconstruncted positions of a set of photons from a point - like source in the sky defines its point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "since this function can be considered azymuthally symmetric in @xmath7-ray telescopes for incidence angle within 30@xmath5 as used in this paper , the effect of the dispersion can be described as a function of one parameter , the angular distance @xmath12 between reconstructed and nominal direction . defining the psf radial profile , p(@xmath12 ) , as the probability distribution per steradian of measuring an incoming photon at a given angular distance @xmath12 from its true direction , we have therefore : +    psf(@xmath12)@xmath13=2@xmath14sin(@xmath12)@xmath15)@xmath13 .    in the following ,",
    "we adopt two parameters widely used in the literature to assess the angular resolution in terms of the `` width '' of the psf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    * the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the probability distribution per steradian , @xmath15 ) * the 68% containment radius ( cr@xmath16 ) of the probability distribution , psf(@xmath12 ) .    the cr@xmath16 is strongly related to the source image compactness , taking into account the whole contribution of source profile and being more affected by possible extended tails ; while the fwhm is mainly determined by the central core emission of the source",
    "in order to fully understand how the instrument configuration and the data analysis pipeline affect the final angular resolution of a gamma - ray telescope , we carried out dedicated mc simulations of the _ agile - grid _ analyzing simulated data with the same pipeline used to process in - flight data .",
    "the simulations were carried out using an available simulation tool (  gams  , geant agile mc simulator ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implemented during the development phase of the _ agile _ mission .",
    "the tool makes use of the geant3 environment and takes into account all the main components of the _ agile _ instrument configuration : the spacecraft ( bus ) mita and the _ agile _ payload , consisting of the csi mini - calorimeter , the silicon - tungsten tracker , the anti - coincidence system , the x - ray detector ( _ super - agile _ ) , the thermal shield , the mechanical structure and the lateral electronics boards .",
    "the tool allows to simulate a parallel front of given direction for both charged particles and/or photons and its interactions across the instruments .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the front can be monochromatic or with any given law .",
    "the simulated tracks are then processed by the dhsim , the data handling simulator @xcite , which implements the on - board algorithms for a first track reconstruction , event classification and background rejection @xcite .",
    "the dhsim output is a data file in the same format as the agile in - flight telemetry and can be processed using the same pipeline as for real data analysis .",
    "further background rejection techniques are applied to the data on ground , producing the final classification of the events .",
    "the currently used filter for the scientific analysis of the _ agile - grid _ data ( `` fm3.119 '' ) was used in this paper also for the processing of the simulated data .",
    "+ each simulation contains @xmath17 photons that cross the tracker and the data are analyzed with the same pipeline as for real data .",
    "typical efficiency after background rejection within 30@xmath5 off - axis angle is @xmath18 , leaving therefore a set of @xmath19 events classified as photons and used for our calculations in the paper .",
    "with the aim of investigating the dependence of the telescope angular resolution upon the energy of incoming photons and their incident direction in the fov , we carried out simulations of parallel fronts of photons by varying those parameters .",
    "+ we describe the incident direction as the composition of a zenith angle @xmath20 ( i.e. the angular distance of the incoming photon direction from the vertical axis of the tracker , also named off - axis angle ) and an azimuthal angle @xmath21 ( i.e. , the angular distance between a given axis in the instrument plane and the projection of the incoming direction in the plane ) .",
    "since the detector response is mostly azimuthally symmetric , we expect the main dependence to be upon @xmath20 .",
    "simulations were carried out for the following values of these angles : @xmath22 , since the case of @xmath23 induces a singularity in the software that generates the parallel front of photons . for our purposes",
    "@xmath24 well resembles the on - axis case . ] ; @xmath25 .",
    "two different sets of simulations were performed :    * parallel fronts of monochromatic photons of energies 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 , 1000 , 5000 mev ; * parallel fronts of photons with a crab - like photon spectrum of the type @xmath26 , in the energy range 30 mev - 50 gev .",
    "the simulated data are analysed with the same pipeline as for the real data . in particular data",
    "were analysed using the most recent pipeline for the data processing ( `` build21 '' ) and instrument response functions ( `` i0023 '' ) .",
    ".results from the simulations of monochromatic photon parallel beams .",
    "68@xmath10 containment radius of the psf in degrees .",
    "events for the different energy channels are selected on the basis of the reconstructed energy , as for real data .",
