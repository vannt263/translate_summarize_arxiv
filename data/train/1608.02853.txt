    "quantum entanglement , predicted by einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) in 1935 has fascinated many physicists because of its highly counterintuitive properties  @xcite . for a long time , it was regarded as a problem of philosophy which could not be tested . in 1981 , however , aspect et al .",
    "succeeded in showing experimental evidence of quantum entanglement  @xcite . since then , more interest has been paid to how to make use of the quantum entanglement of epr pairs in the fields of quantum cryptography , quantum information and quantum teleportation  @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement due to pair creation is well studied in non - relativistic regimes .",
    "one interesting feature of pair creation in relativistic quantum theory is that of observer dependence  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the quantum entanglement between two free modes of a scalar field becomes less entangled if observers who detect each mode are relatively accelerated . in  @xcite , they considered two free modes of a scalar field in flat space .",
    "one is detected by an observer in an inertial frame and the other by a uniformly accelerated observer .",
    "they evaluated the entanglement negativity , a measure of entanglement for mixed states , between the two free modes , which started in a maximally entangled state , to characterize the quantum entanglement and found that the entanglement disappeared for the observer in the limit of infinite acceleration .",
    "observer dependent entanglement can also be discussed in the context of an expanding universe .",
    "the expansion of the universe produces pair creation .",
    "quantum entanglement has been investigated in this situation in  @xcite . to see if entanglement itself exists between causally disconnected regions of de sitter space , entanglement entropy , a measure of entanglement for pure states , has been studied in the bunch - davies vacuum  @xcite and in @xmath3-vacua   @xcite .",
    "entanglement negativity has been also studied in @xcite . since it was found that the entanglement between causally separated regions in de sitter space exists , in  @xcite the question was asked whether there are observable effects of entanglement on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) in our universe .",
    "it was recently shown that quantum entanglement is not the only kind of quantum correlations possible , and are merely a particular characterization of quantumness .",
    "in fact , other quantum correlations have now been experimentally found , and quantum discord is known to be a measure of all quantum correlations , including entanglement  @xcite .",
    "this measure can be non - zero even in the absence of entanglement .",
    "quantum discord is a useful measure to discuss the performance of quantum computers , which has lead to a lot of works on this topic  @xcite . in order to see the observer dependence of all quantum correlations ( ie .",
    "the total quantumness ) , the quantum discord between two free modes of a scalar field in flat space , which are detected by two observers in inertial and non - inertial frames respectively , has also been discussed  @xcite .",
    "they found that the quantum discord , in contrast to the entanglement , never disappears , even in the limit of infinite acceleration .    to construct a theory of gravity compatible with quantum field theory",
    "is one of the biggest challenges in modern physics .",
    "hence , in trying to understand this problem fully it is important to study quantumness in the context of curved space .",
    "moreover , it is one of the cornerstones of inflationary cosmology that the large scale structure of our universe and temperature fluctuations of the cmb originate from quantum fluctuations during the initial inflationary era .",
    "therefore , this study of quantumness in curved spaces may itself lead to a better understanding of the initial stages of our universe and more precise predictions for cosmological observations .",
    "to this aim , quantum discord has recently been studied in a cosmological context  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the study of quantum discord in rindler space to that in de sitter space . in the case of rindler space ,",
    "the effect of a non - inertial frame on the quantum correlations has been studied .",
    "since the non - inertial observer in rindler space corresponds to the observer in an open chart of de sitter space , we will see the effect of the curvature of the open chart on the quantum discord between two free modes of a massive scalar field in de sitter space .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , we review the quantum information theoretic basis of quantum discord . in section 3 , we quantize a free massive scalar field in de sitter space and express the bunch - davies vacuum in a global chart in term of the fock space in open charts of de sitter space .",
    "in section 4 , we introduce two observers , alice and bob , who detect two free modes of the scalar field which start in an entangle state .",
    "we obtain the density operator for alice and bob . in section 5 , we compute the entanglement negativity . in section 6 ,",
    "we evaluate the quantum discord in de sitter space . in the final section",
    "we summarize our results and provide an outlook for possible future calculations .",
    "quantum discord is a measure of all quantum correlations including entanglement for two subsystems  @xcite . for a mixed state",
    ", this measure can be nonzero even if the state is unentangled .",
    "it is defined by quantum mutual information and computed by optimizing over all possible measurements that can be performed on one of the subsystems .    in classical information theory ,",
    "the mutual information between two random variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 where the shannon entropy @xmath7 is used to quantify the ignorance of information about the variable @xmath4 with probability @xmath8 , and the joint entropy @xmath9 with the joint probability @xmath10 of both events @xmath4 and @xmath5 occuring . the mutual information ( [ mi1 ] ) measures how much information @xmath4 and @xmath5 have in common .    using bayes theorem , the joint probability can be written in terms of the conditional probability as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the probability of @xmath4 given @xmath5 . the joint entropy",

    "( [ mi1 ] ) and ( [ mi2 ] ) are classically equivalent expressions for the mutual information .",
    "if we try to generalize the concept of mutual information to quantum system , the above two equivalent expressions do not yield identical results because measurements performed on subsystem @xmath5 disturb subsystem @xmath4 . in a quantum system ,",
    "the shannon entropy is replaced by the von neumann entropy @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a density matrix .",
    "the probabilities @xmath10 , @xmath8 and @xmath19 are replaced respectively by the density matrix of the whole system @xmath20 , the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath4 , @xmath21 , and the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath5 , @xmath22 .    in order to extend the idea of the conditional probability @xmath12 to the quantum system , we use projective measurements of @xmath5 described by a complete set of projectors @xmath23 , where @xmath24 distinguishes different outcomes of a measurement on @xmath5 .",
    "there are of course many different sets of measurements that we can make .",
    "then the state of @xmath4 after the measurement of @xmath5 is given by @xmath25 a quantum analog of the conditional entropy can then be defined as @xmath26 which corresponds to the measurement that least disturbs the overall quantum state , that is , to avoid dependence on the projectors .    thus , the quantum mutual information corresponding to the two expressions eqs .",

    "<S> we study quantum discord between two free modes of a massive scalar field in a maximally entangled state in de sitter space . we introduce two observers , one in a global chart and the other in an open chart of de sitter space , and the observers determine the quantum discord created by each detecting one of the modes </S>",
    "<S> this situation is analogous to the relationship between an observer in a minkowski chart and another in one of the two rindler charts in flat space . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the state becomes less entangled as the curvature of the open chart gets larger . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the cases of a massless , and a conformally coupled scalar field , the entanglement vanishes in the limit of infinite curvature . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the quantum discord never disappears even in the limit that entanglement disappears .    </S>",
