    "an even more instructive parametrization of the string is the quantity @xmath70 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the dimensions of the computational box in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 direction , respectively ; it serves as a measure of the position of the triple line .    from the free energy profiles for the advance or retreat of the liquid wedge over a defect we subtract the free energy profile obtained for the filling of the corresponding defect - free channel ( figs .",

    "first , jdg consider a special case of wetting hysteresis , i.e. , one which arises from macroscale ( @xmath147  nm ) , _ strong _ defects , where strong means that the defect is capable of inducing two distinct configurations of the liquid - vapor interface  a weakly and a strongly deformed one  at the same nominal position of the unperturbed contact line .",
    "depending on the history of contact line motion ( i.e. , advance or retreat ) one of these two configurations is selected , giving rise to wetting hysteresis .",
    "however the nanodefects considered here are weak in the jdg sense , and there is only a single configuration of the liquid - vapor interface for a given position of the triple line , as demonstrated by the free energy profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] and [ fig : forced]a .",
    "in fact , wetting hysteresis for these nanodefects emerges if the quasi - static procedure in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] requires different forcing for advance and retreat .",
    "alternatively , it can be regarded as a hysteresis in the contact line position upon cycling the driving force . in our approach",
    "we explicitly refer to the driving force @xmath117 ( or @xmath148 ) ; this suggests an experimental realization of our thought experiment in which a liquid front is quasi - statically driven through a narrow channel with suitably prepared walls by stepwise changing the pressure in an attached fluid reservoir and simultaneously measuring the position of the liquid front .",
    "alternatively , the afm technique with special carbon tips used in ref .",
    "@xcite is capable to determine both the force and the position of the contact line for a single nanodefect ; a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] appears to be possible . , but with the ( intrinsic ) defect force @xmath149 introduced in the next section . ]",
    "another experimental technique is the noncontact afm for nanoscale wetting used by checco _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . on a larger scale ,",
    "also the wilhelmy plate technique @xcite could be used , while macroscopic contact angle hysteresis arising from dilute distributions of nanodefects can be measured and related to the defect characteristics via eq .",
    "( see next section ) .",
    "another peculiarity of nanodefects are thermally activated crossings , the description of which requires specialized rare - events techniques in order to reveal the transition path and thus the ( unexpected ) sigmoidal free energy profile . in a certain sense , the findings of the present nanoscale analysis are complementary to the macroscopic picture of jdg for strong defects , revealing that wetting hysteresis induced by nanodefects proceeds via a different mechanism ; hysteresis disappears if thermal fluctuations become dominant .",
    "a major difference between the two approches is our capability to achieve a microscopic description which can cope with the problem that for nanodefects there is no clear scale separation between the linear extensions of the defects and the length scales characterizing the fluid inhomogeneities at the solid - fluid and at the liquid - vapor interfaces , the deformations of the latter , and the range of the force fields .",
    "indeed we have found that incorporating such details can be important for obtaining a quantitative prediction of the pinning characteristics of nanodefects .",
    "further , in order to fully exploit the potential of our microscopic approach we are searching for the transition path in the infinite dimensional configuration space spanned by all possible density distributions .",
    "this way we also avoid the problem of `` hidden '' variables which may arise if one uses only a reduced set of variables ( actually two in the treatment of jdg ) ; the actual path may be even completely concealed within a reduced description ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this latter problem affects the estimates of , e.g. , the free energy barriers involved and , with exponential sensitivity , those of the kinetics .",
    "in the discussion above , we have referred to _ wetting hysteresis _ as the qualitative differences in the advancing and receding processes , occurring in nanochannels and for a single defect  thereby avoiding the notion of contact angle hysteresis .",
    "the latter requires scale separation between the characteristic size of the defects and that of the macroscopic liquid body ( _ e.g. _ , the drop ) , which for nanodefects is typically the case , and a definition of the macroscopic apparent contact angle @xmath150 . in the following ,",
    "we provide such a definition and we express @xmath150 in terms of the microscopic quantities given in table  [ tab : barriers ] which , rigorously speaking , were computed for nanodefects in nanochannels .",
    "we first derive these relations for a straight row of nanoscale defects parallel to the liquid front .",
    "subsequently , we generalize these results to a random , dilute distribution of defects , which is closer to actual surfaces studied experimentally .    before discussing the two special arrangements of nanodefects ,",
    "we introduce a general definition of the macroscopic apparent contact angle .",
    "we first observe that the deformations of the liquid - vapor interface induced by the wall and by the defects vanish at sufficiently large distances from the walls and from the defects and that the interface assumes one of the simple macroscopic shapes compatible with the macroscopic laplace equation ( spherical cap , cylindrical cap , plane , etc . ) .",
    "this macroscopic interface can be extrapolated up to the wall surface and the intersection of these two surfaces defines the apparent contact angle @xmath150 and the macroscopic geometrical position of the three - phase - contact or triple line . in the cases discussed here ,",
    "the macroscopic triple line is a straight line in the @xmath25-@xmath79 plane parallel to the @xmath79 axis , characterized by the coordinate @xmath151 .      in order to characterize _",
    "static _ contact angle hysteresis , we seek for mechanically ( meta)stable configurations of the contact line . for the system studied in the previous sections  a liquid wedge migrating across a periodic arrangement ( row ) of defects aligned along the @xmath79 direction ",
    "metastable states correspond to the minima of eq .  .",
    "differentiating that equation with respect to @xmath24 and recalling the relation @xmath152 leads to @xmath153 where we introduced the more compact notation @xmath154 .",
    "the first term is the microscopic force @xmath155 exerted on the contact line by the single defect present in the computational box .",
    "the second term is the total macroscopic force which has to be balanced by the microscopic defect force . using the relation @xmath156 the macroscopic force",
    "can be also expressed in terms of the pressure difference across the liquid - vapor interface as @xmath157 . as indicated by the acronym _",
    "st _ , eq .",
    "has _ _ st__able solutions @xmath158 only within a certain range of macroscopic forces along the advancing or receding processes which correspond to the black or red solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath159 is defect - specific and independent of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , because it is determined by the local wetting properties of the defect and by the local deformations of the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "according to eq .",
    ", in order to render also @xmath117 and @xmath148 defect - specific , one has to multiply them by @xmath160 .",
    "for instance , by multiplying @xmath102 in table  [ tab : barriers ] by our system specific quantity @xmath161 one obtains an intrinsic quantity which can be related to the maximum force a defect can exert on the triple line ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to connect with macroscopic contact angles and contact angle hysteresis ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we observe that in eq .",
    "the total macroscopic driving force @xmath162 must act also on the contact line . on the other hand , within a macroscopic description ,",
    "the force on the triple line is determined by the action of the interfacial tensions .",
    "its relevant lateral component is young s unbalanced force @xmath163 , with the macroscopic apparent contact angle @xmath150 . replacing in eq .",
    "the total macroscopic driving force by the unbalanced young s force we obtain @xmath164 equation   links the macroscopic contact angle at a given driving force @xmath117 to the microscopic defect force acting effectively on the triple line in correspondence to its stable configurations identified by @xmath165 .",
    "the _ supporting information _ provides an alternative route to eq .",
    "based on laplace s law .",
    "a quantity of particular interest is the so - called advancing contact angle @xmath166 , which is the maximum apparent contact angle compatible with a static configuration during the advancing process .",
    "it is obtained by evaluating eq .   at the maximum force",
    "the defects can exert upon opposing the advancing process , yielding @xmath167 . for an advancing barrier the maximum force",
    "is reached at @xmath168 .",
    "similarly , the receding contact angle @xmath169 corresponds to the maximum force ( with opposite direction ) the defects can exert upon opposing the receding process . in order to obtain @xmath169 for a receding barrier we likewise evaluate eq .   at @xmath168 , but now @xmath102 has a negative sign . for a pure advance barrier the maximum force opposing",
    "the receding process is zero .",
    "therefore , the rhs of eq",
    ".   is zero so that @xmath170 for this type of barrier .",
    "the above definitions of @xmath166 and @xmath169 coincide with the usual experimental notion of static contact angle hysteresis , which is measured just before the macroscopically defined contact line starts moving . for the posts discussed in the previous section ( advance barrier , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis]a ) the definitions of @xmath166 and @xmath169 , together with eq .  , yield a very strong contact angle hysteresis : @xmath171 , corresponding to @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "these two angles refer to a defect line density of @xmath174 corresponding to @xmath175 and to the liquid - vapor interface advancing simultaneously across all lined - up defects .",
    "we now consider a random , dilute distribution of identical nanodefects . as discussed in the previous subsection , even in this case , away from the walls the liquid - vapor interface attains its macroscopic shape characterized by the apparent contact angle @xmath150 and the position @xmath24 of the macroscopic triple line .",
    "therefore it is possible to establish a force balance between the unbalanced young s force on the macroscopic triple line and the forces provided by the distribution of defects , analogous to eq .  .",
    "in order to provide an explicit equation , we first assume that the combined effect of the defects on a liquid front follows from linear superposition of the individual effects  @xcite .",
    "this additivity hypothesis , which is expected to be valid for dilute defect distributions , neglects the fact that also the presence of a neighboring defect can alter the local shape of the triple line , thus affecting the metastable configurations .",
    "therefore , within this assumption , the free energy profiles and the metastable configurations are the same for the quite distinct two cases of randomly distributed and aligned defects . actually , this is the content of a second hypothesis according to which the force on the macroscopic straight triple line exerted by a single defect at a distance @xmath176 from the triple line is the same as the one ( for the same @xmath177 ) computed per defect for a periodic row of defects sufficiently apart from each other .",
    "but in contrast to the above case of aligned defects , the force each defect exerts on the triple line depends on its distance @xmath177 from the macroscopic triple line , which is random .",
    "we therefore have to average the rhs of eq .   over the contribution of all defects adding to the force on a ( straight ) segment of the macroscopic triple line of length @xmath77 .",
    "however , before performing this average in mathematical terms some further remarks are needful and we have to introduce a third hypothesis , which actually is related to the other two .",
    "we first remark that in the absence of an external driving force the ( mesoscopic ) triple line avoids crossing those regions where the forces are not negligible ; these regions do not extend much beyond the defects ( i.e. , less than an order of magnitude of the defect size ) . without this",
    "wiggling the two hypotheses above would lead to a non - zero mean defect force which is not balanced by an external driving force .",
    "these wiggles typically have a long wavelength , given by the average distance between the defects along the triple line , and an amplitude which is small and of the order of the linear extension of the defects , i.e. , of nanometric size for the nanodefects discussed here . in order to calculate the mean force on the macroscopic triple line",
    ", we do not explicitly consider the aforementioned wiggles of the ( mesoscopic ) triple line .",
    "instead , we average over the forces computed for various distances from the straight triple line , but we exclude from the average those relative distances @xmath177 which would lead to locally unstable configurations .",
    "this is the content of our third hypothesis which by now is formulated , taking into account an external driving force acting on the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "we are interested in the maximum absolute value of the total defect force on a triple line segment , which can be provided by a random distribution of defects in an advance or a retreat experiment .",
    "we first focus on the advancing process across post - like defects ( exhibiting a barrier in advancing direction ) . for a row of defects our calculations",
    "have shown that the defect force steadily increases if the liquid - vapor interface is pushed against it until it reaches a maximum at a driving force @xmath178 . in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis]b , for @xmath179 the position of the triple line becomes unstable and snaps over those parts of each defect in the straight row which are not covered by liquid .",
    "we now assume that _ locally _ a similar behavior occurs for randomly distributed defects .",
    "once @xmath180 is larger than the critical distance corresponding to the maximum force which can be mustered by an individual defect , the triple line becomes locally unstable and slides over the still dry part of that specific defect .",
    "accordingly , the defect forces corresponding to these unstable positions do not contribute to the overall force average .",
    "the average is performed only over forces corresponding to ( meta)stable positions , which are characterized by @xmath181 . a relation to a driving force @xmath117",
    "is not given , because only the total driving force on the liquid front can be controlled , but not the force of a specific defect acting on a segment of the macroscopic triple line .",
    "for an advancing process over defects exhibiting a barrier in advance direction , @xmath182 ranges from a value @xmath24 on the lower plateau in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] to @xmath183 , characterizing the distance corresponding to the maximum defect force . @xmath184",
    "is identified with @xmath168 as determined from the computations for a row of defects . for a receding process over post - like defects ,",
    "the defect forces are zero for all ( meta)stable triple line positions . for analyzing the case of defects providing a receding barrier one has to interchange the role of advancing and receding processes in the discussion above .    in order to provide quantitative results ,",
    "we first introduce a length @xmath185 characterizing the range of distances from the triple line within which the defect forces are non - negligible .",
    "the total number @xmath186 of defects interacting with the segment @xmath77 of the triple line is @xmath187 with @xmath188 the areal number density of the defects .",
    "the averaging is carried out by integrating over all possible defect distances @xmath189 with equal weight @xmath190 ( so that @xmath191 ) or , equivalently , by integrating over the relative triple line position @xmath192 : @xmath193 without randomness eq .",
    "reduces to eq .   with @xmath194 . in eq .",
    "the notation should be interpreted such that integrands are equal to zero for positions @xmath195 which do not belong to metastable positions @xmath182 of the triple line along the advancing or the receding processes .",
    "this also applies to the last equation , in which we evaluate @xmath196 at the maximum and the minimum values of @xmath184 ( @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively ) .",
    "for instance , the advancing process over post - like defects is characterized by @xmath199 , while @xmath200 corresponds to some position @xmath24 along the lower plateau in the free energy profile , e.g. , @xmath119 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis]a ) .",
    "evaluating eq .   over the whole metastable interval @xmath201 of the advancing process",

    ", we obtain an estimate for the contact angle hysteresis : @xmath212 equation   is valid also for retreat barriers ( fig .",

    "the values of @xmath215 in table  [ tab : barriers ] together with eq .   allow us to determine which density of nanodefects of the post kind , with the characteristics chosen in the present investigations , is needed in order to induce macroscopically relevant pinning . as a typical measurable difference in cosines we adopt @xmath216 , use the surface tension of our simple liquid @xmath217 , and assume @xmath218  nm , which yields for the post defect a projected area @xmath219  nm@xmath220 . since @xmath221  @xmath13 for a single post defect , from eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath222  nm@xmath223 , corresponding to a surface coverage @xmath224 of ca .",
    "this simple calculation for a post of size @xmath226 and young contact angle @xmath227 suggests that even dilute chemical and topographical defects of sub - nanometer scale can be responsible for the pinning phenomena associated with nanobubble stability  @xcite .",
    "for comparison , the contact angle hysteresis of the substrate employed in recent experiments on nanobubbles @xcite was @xmath228 for a slightly larger roughness .",
    "we have studied a liquid wedge advancing or receding across a single chemical or topographical heterogeneity of nanometric size .",
    "we have devised a method which combines string calculations with microscopic classical density functional theory in order to determine free energy profiles for overcoming such obstacles .",
    "this approach has allowed us to take into account specific microscopic effects , which have turned out to be significant on the nanoscale . at liquid - vapor coexistence",
    "the free energy profiles exhibit as function of the position of the triple line a sigmoidal shape with two plateaus which correspond to the heterogeneity being exposed solely to vapor or completely covered with liquid , respectively . for",
    "the topographical and chemical protrusion studied , the macroscopic estimate for the difference of these plateau values is half of the actual microscopic result .",
    "based on the computed free energy profiles we have discussed thermally activated depinning of the three phase contact line in the absence of driving forces .",
    "we have shown that wetting hysteresis originates from the occurrence of a metastable `` pinned '' state within a certain range of chemical potentials . forcing the system towards and off two - phase coexistence leads to qualitatively distinct advance and retreat branches .",
    "the defects considered here are weak in terms of the classification of joanny and de gennes ; however , some of them nonetheless give rise to wetting hysteresis .",
    "our estimates of the macroscopic effects of a distribution of nanoscale defects indicate that a @xmath225 surface coverage of lyophobic topographical defects with a lateral extension smaller of @xmath229  nm is sufficient to induce a measurably large contact angle hysteresis , i.e. , @xmath228 .",
    "these figures match well with those obtained from recent nanobubbles experiments .",
    "our results suggest that this provides a mechanism for contact line pinning which is needed to explain the unexpected long lifetime of the nanobubbles .",
    "finally , the techniques introduced here and the proposed framework for discussing wetting hysteresis have laid a common probabilistic ground for understanding deterministic and thermally activated pinning of three - phase contact lines .",
    "accordingly , this analysis is expected to clear the way for future detailed microscopic studies of activated processes in fluids at small scales .",

    "<S> although tiny and thus difficult to control and to characterize , these nanoscale defects have remarkable _ macroscopic _ consequences , such as generating measurable differences between advancing and receding liquid fronts  i.e. , the _ contact angle hysteresis _ investigated here .    the phenomena which originate from the interaction between surface heterogeneities and liquids are diverse and various names are used to underscore different aspects . for instance , `` pinning '' refers to hindrance of the motion of the contact line , `` wetting hysteresis '' is here defined as the qualitative difference between advancing and receding processes , while `` contact angle hysteresis '' indicates the difference observed between the apparent contact angle of advancing and receding drops . </S>",
    "<S> understanding and relating all these different aspects of the problem requires a thorough theoretical investigation about the origin of hysteresis in wetting : many years after the first systematic studies @xcite , contact angle hysteresis continues to be a very active research topic in physics , physical chemistry , and materials science @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the issue of surface nanobubbles @xcite is a contemporary example of the debate on wetting hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> the pinning of their contact line seems to be the crucial element for explaining the unexpectedly long lifetime of nanobubbles . </S>",
    "<S> recent findings have shown that nanobubbles can survive for hours due to a combination of contact line pinning and retarded one - dimensional diffusion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> zhang _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> experimentally verified that nanobubbles are indeed pinned at the surface and that their apparent shape is that of a spherical cap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the size of surface nanobubbles , with a typical base radius @xmath0 , and the regularity of their shape suggest that the pinning originates from much smaller surface defects , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , in the nanometer range </S>",
    "<S> . however , it is still an open question whether defects below @xmath1  nm can pin a liquid - gas interface at all @xcite and thus whether they can be the cause of the stability of nanobubbles .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments , using atomic force microscopy , reported the pinning force exerted by nanoscale defects @xcite : ondaruhu _ et al . _ were able to identify single pinning or depinning events . </S>",
    "<S> however , to the best of our knowledge there are no wetting experiments , involving a single well - characterized nanoscale defect , which are capable to relate the characteristics of the defect with the pinning force . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is crucial to resolve how the chemical and topographical nano - features of surfaces determine contact angle hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> another intriguing and still open question is _ how _ a liquid front advances or recedes across such features .    </S>",
    "<S> pinning of the contact line is important not only for static contact angle hysteresis but also for contact line motion ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in the case of nanoscale defects </S>",
    "<S> , experiments suggest that the mechanism of contact line motion is governed by thermally activated pinning and depinning events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the `` pinning energy '' ( _ i.e. _ , the free energy barrier ) related to nanodefects may be of the order of @xmath2 @xcite ; thus , depending on the physical and chemical properties of the nanodefects , the migration across a defect may be a deterministic process driven by an external force or a stochastic one induced by thermal fluctuation . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments on colloids at the air - water interface suggest that thermal activation of local deformations of the triple line , possibly induced by pinning at nanodefects , can explain their anomalous diffusion coefficient @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these experimental evidences also call for a better characterization of the advance and the retreat of liquids over nanodefects in terms of free energy barriers , revealing the type of mechanism at work and the associated rate of the process .    </S>",
    "<S> contact angle hysteresis was studied theoretically in the seminal paper by joanny and de gennes alluding to strong , isolated defects with characteristic size larger than ca . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3  nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therein the macroscopic deformation of the liquid - vapor interface was worked out by assigning a given defect `` force '' both to smooth and to mesa defects having sharp discontinuities . </S>",
    "<S> robbins and joanny @xcite focused on weak , macroscopic heterogeneities which individually are incapable to pin the interface but which induce contact angle hysteresis _ via _ collective pinning by many defects . </S>",
    "<S> yeomans _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> performed mesoscale ( @xmath4  nm ) lattice boltzmann simulations for drops and liquid slabs in channels in order to calculate contact angle hysteresis on superhydrophobic surfaces and dense chemical patterns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this way , a quasi - static numerical experiment was performed , which determines the ( meta)stable configurations at given drop radii @xcite or at prescribed apparent contact angles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar approach was followed by semprebon _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite who used surface evolver @xcite in order to compute the modes of advance of the liquid on macroscopically structured surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the string method was used in connection with ginzburg - landau models in order to explore the cassie - wenzel transition for droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to date only few studies investigated how the `` pinning force '' or the corresponding free energy barriers are related to the geometrical and chemical characteristics of defects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at the nanoscale , at which the typical dimensions of the roughness are comparable to the size of the liquid particles and where van der waals forces come into play , wetting hysteresis as well as advancing and receding mechanisms remain still unexplored .    </S>",
    "<S> the present study aims at a microscopic understanding of the mechanism of hysteresis induced by chemical or topographical defects at the nanoscale . </S>",
    "<S> contact line motion at that scale might also be a thermally assisted process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore discuss , within the same framework , both macroscopic deterministic pinning or depinning , as has been done in many previous analyses , as well as thermally activated depinning . </S>",
    "<S> predicting thermally activated pinning or depinning rates requires _ </S>",
    "<S> inter alia _ the knowledge of the corresponding activation barriers . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to understand hysteresis one has to go beyond the equilibrium picture and investigate how the free energy landscape , including features such as metastable minima and activation barriers , is influenced by deterministic forces driving the liquid . </S>",
    "<S> here we have combined a microscopic description of the fluid in terms of the classical density functional theory ( dft ) due to rosenfeld , which is reliable on molecular scales @xcite , with the string method @xcite , a state - of - the - art tool for the study of rare events . </S>",
    "<S> this facilitates to accurately characterize the mechanism and the free energy barriers associated with a liquid wedge advancing or receding over a single chemical or topographical nanodefect . </S>",
    "<S> the string method allowed us to overcome the limitations of brute force calculations in the presence of metastabilities , to identify the _ _ transition path _ _ ( shown in the videos in the _ supporting information _ ) , and to provide accurate estimates for free energy barriers for wetting or drying across a single heterogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> since we are including microscopic details of the fluid , our approach can capture the diverse effects related to nanodefects . as demonstrated by our results , for such defects predictions based on macroscopic concepts like surface energies and </S>",
    "<S> contact angle become unreliable and incomplete . given the experimental difficulty to access simultaneously the geometry and the chemistry of a nanodefect and the force exerted by it on advancing or receding liquid fronts , the present calculations are the first attempt to fully characterize nanoscale wetting hysteresis .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized such that the first section is devoted to the description of the computational methods , with particular emphasis on novel aspects . </S>",
    "<S> the second section is concerned with the results on wetting hysteresis on single defects and the discussion of them . </S>",
    "<S> the third section investigates the role of dilute distributions of nanodefects on the macroscopic advancing and receding contact angles ( i.e. , contact angle hysteresis ) . </S>"
