    "although a large amount of work has been done characterising the properties of the kolmogorov @xmath0 spectrum of three dimensional turbulence , rather less attention has been paid to the transient evolution which leads to its establishment .",
    "this transient evolution is essentially non - dissipative since it describes the cascade process before it reaches the dissipation scale .",
    "part of the reason why this process has attracted relatively little attention is that this transient evolution is very fast , typically taking place within a single large eddy turnover time .",
    "it is thus of little relevance to the developed turbulence regime of interest in many applications .",
    "nevertheless , one may ask whether this developing turbulence , as one might call this transient regime , displays any interesting scaling properties .",
    "previous studies of the developing regime in weak magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite suggest that this transient regime might have non - trivial scaling properties : in this case it was found that the establishment of the kolmogorov spectrum is preceded by a transient spectrum which is steeper than the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "this latter is , in turn , set up from right to left in wavenumber space only after the transient spectrum has reached the end of the inertial range and started to produce dissipation .",
    "subsequent studies suggest that this behaviour , in particular the occurence of a non - trivial dynamical scaling exponent , is typical for turbulent cascades which are finite capacity - meaning that the stationary spectrum can only contain a finite amount of energy .",
    "the kolmogorov spectrum of three dimensional turbulence is in the class of finite capacity systems , as we shall see below .",
    "there are , however , examples of other turbulent cascades which are not - infinite capacity cascades are common in wave turbulence for example @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mhd cascade mentioned above , examples of non - trivial scaling exponents in finite capacity cascades have been found in developing wave turbulence @xcite , bose - einstein condensation @xcite and cluster - cluster aggregation @xcite .",
    "although a possible heuristic explanation of the transient scaling in the mhd context has been put forward in @xcite , this heuristic relies heavily on the anisotropy of the mhd cascade and does not seem readily generalisable to other contexts . in general , the transient exponent is associated with a self - similarity problem of the second kind @xcite . from a mathematical point of view , its solution requires solving a nonlinear equation in which the exponent appears as a parameter which is fixed by requiring consistency with boundary conditions .",
    "it is probably unrealistic to expect that there is a general heuristic argument capable of resolving such a mathematically challenging problem .",
    "this is not to say , however , that particular cases may not be amenable to heuristic arguments which take into account the underlying _ physical _ mechanisms driving the transient evolution rather than taking a purely mathematical point of view .",
    "this issue has not yet been studied in the context of homogeneous isotropic turbulence .",
    "investigations of transient spectra in the classical leith closure model @xcite have suggested , however , that the transient spectrum of developing homogeneous isotropic turbulence is indeed non - trivially steeper than @xmath0 @xcite . in this work",
    ", we investigate the transient evolution of homogeneous isotropic turbulence using the eddy - damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) closure model and direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the transient spectrum might be expected to evolve self - similarly . in other words",
    "there is a typical wavenumber , @xmath1 , which grows in time , and a dynamical scaling exponent , @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 here @xmath4 denotes the scaling limit : @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 fixed and @xmath8 is an order unity constant which ensures that @xmath9 has the correct physical dimensions , @xmath10 .",
    "as we shall see , if the exponent , @xmath11 , is greater than 1 , then the characteristic wavenumber diverges in finite time corresponding to a cascade which accelerates `` explosively '' .",
    "the direct cascade in 3d turbulence is of this type .",
    "the characteristic wavenumber is most easily defined as a ratio of moments of the energy spectrum .",
    "let us define @xmath12 eq .",
    "( [ eq - scalingansatz ] ) suggests that the ratio @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath1 so that we may define a typical scale intrinsically by @xmath14    a little caution is required : we must take @xmath15 sufficiently high to ensure that the moments @xmath16 used in defining the typical scale , converge at zero .",
    "otherwise , the integral is dominated by the initial condition or forcing scale and does not capture the scaling behaviour . in this paper , we mostly take @xmath17 , which turns out to be sufficient for our purposes , although we will compare the behaviour obtained for @xmath17 and @xmath18 in our numerical simulations to assure the reader that the picture is consistent .",
    "we would like to emphasise that the self - similar transient dynamics which we study in this paper occur _ before _ the onset of dissipation .",
    "this is in contrast to the transient dynamics describing the long time decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence _",
    "after _ the onset of dissipation which are also believed to exhibit self - similarity .",
    "see @xcite for recent experiments and a review of previous work .",
    "some numerical results on the long time transient dynamics of the edqnm model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the pre - dissipation transient occurs very quickly . indeed , as we shall see",
    ", the typical scale , @xmath1 , in this regime diverges as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the time at which the onset of dissipation occurs ( typically less than a single turnover time ) and @xmath21 . for finite reynolds number",
    ", this singularity is regularised by the finiteness of the dissipation scale .",
    "the fact that , in the limit of infinite reynolds number , the typical scale can grow by an arbitrary amount in an arbitrarily small time interval as @xmath20 is approached explains the statement often found in the literature that the kolmogorov spectrum is established quasi - instantaneously in the limit of large reynolds number .",
    "in this section we examine the self - similar solutions of the edqnm model @xcite .",
    "the structure of the edqnm model can be obtained in different ways .",
    "one way is starting from the quasi - normal assumption @xcite .",
    "another way is by simplifying the direct interaction approximation @xcite which was obtained by applying a renormalized perturbation procedure to the navier - stokes equation .",
    "it is thus directly related to the navier - stokes equation , unlike the leith model which was heuristically proposed to capture some features of the nonlinear transfer in isotropic turbulence .",
    "however , recent work @xcite showed that the structure of the leith model can be obtained by retaining a subset of triad interactions involving elongated triads from closures like edqnm .",
    "since edqnm contains a wider variety of triad interactions , it is able to capture more details of the actual dynamics of navier - stokes turbulence , as for example illustrated in @xcite . at the same time it has the advantage over dns that much higher reynolds numbers can be obtained .",

    "this is in line with expectations : it is widely believed that onset of dissipation in the direct cascade is set by the large scale eddy turnover time rather than the reynolds number .",
    "this explosive growth is the key to understanding why these arguments for the value of the exponent @xmath2 are flawed . in both cases we assumed implicitly that the integral",
    ", @xmath54 does not diverge at its lower limit ( it does not diverge at its upper limit since @xmath55 decays exponentially for large values of @xmath7 ) . in order to study this issue ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath55 has power law asymptotics near @xmath56 : @xmath57 the exponent @xmath58 is the spectral exponent of the transient spectrum . in the case that @xmath1 diverges in finite time , then this assumption of power law asymptotics for @xmath55 taken together with the scaling ansatz requires that @xmath59 . to choose",
    "otherwise would result in the large scale part of the energy spectrum either diverging or vanishing at the onset of dissipation , neither of which is acceptable .",
    "both values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 thus result in divergence of @xmath54 rendering our arguments inconsistent . in the latter ( unforced ) case ,",

    "firstly , although there is no a - priori reason why this should be so , the transient exponents measured for the forced and unforced cases are the same within our estimated range of uncertainty .",
    "this is quite different from infinite capacity cascades where constraints imposed by conservation laws result in different transient scaling exponents for the forced and unforced cases @xcite .",

    "this confirms our expectation that the transient scaling is different from kolmogorov .",

    "to summarise , we have investigated the self - similar evolution of transient spectra in three dimensional turbulence using numerical solutions of the edqnm equation and full dns data .",
    "these transients develop before the onset of dissipation and lead to the establishment of the kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "we argued that the self - similarity is of the second kind allowing the transient scaling to be anomalous in the sense that it can not be determined from dimensional considerations .",
    "this is supported by numerical data for the edqnm equation which gave a transient exponent of @xmath88 compared to the kolmogorov value of @xmath81 .",
    "corresponding measurements for the dns data were inconclusive owing to the relatively short scaling range available .",
    "nevertheless we would expect , based on our results , that a dns at sufficiently high reynolds number would see a steeper transient spectrum .",
    "the most relevant message from this work for turbulence research is probably not the value of the transient exponent itself , since few applications care about this early stage regime .",
    "rather it is the fact that such a non - kolmogorov scaling exists in the first place which serves as a reminder that , while the @xmath0 scaling is quite robust when the energy flux through the inertial range is constant , it is not the sole scaling law consistent with the transfer of energy to small scales in turbulence when the constant flux requirement is relaxed ."
