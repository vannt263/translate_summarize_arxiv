    "the process of bremsstrahlung from high - energy electron occurs over a rather long distance , known as the formation length . if the formation length of the bremsstrahlung becomes comparable to the distance over which a mean angle of multiple scattering becomes comparable with a characteristic angle of radiation , the bremsstrahlung will be suppressed ( the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "an influence of polarization of a medium on radiation process leads also to suppression of the soft photon emission ( ter - mikaelian effect , see in @xcite ) .",
    "a very successful series of experiments @xcite - @xcite was performed at slac during recent years . in these experiments",
    "the cross section of the bremsstrahlung of soft photons with energy from 200  kev to 500  mev from electrons with energies 8  gev and 25  gev is measured with an accuracy of the order of a few percent .",
    "both the lpm effect , and dielectric suppression ( the effects of the polarization of a medium ) were observed and investigated .",
    "these experiments were a challenge for a theory since in all the previous papers calculations ( cited in @xcite ) were performed to logarithmic accuracy which is not enough for a description of the new experiment .",
    "very recently authors developed the new approach to the theory of the lpm effect @xcite in which the cross section of the bremsstrahlung process in the photon energies region where the influence of the lpm is very strong was calculated with a term @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is characteristic logarithm of the problem , and with the coulomb corrections taken into account . in the photon energy region , where the lpm effect is `` turned off ''",

    "in @xcite we investigated the case when a target is much thicker or much thinner than the formation length of the radiation .",
    "a target of an intermediate thickness was studied in paper @xcite . in the last paper we derived general expression for the spectral probability of radiation in a thin target and in a target of intermediate thickness in which the multiple scattering , the polarization of a medium and radiation on the boundaries of a target are taken into account . in @xcite",
    "the effect of multiphoton emission from a single electron was studied , this effect is very essential for understanding data @xcite-@xcite . the lpm effect was recently under active investigation , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and review @xcite .    in papers",

    "the probability of radiation in a radiator consisting of @xmath0 plates is calculated .",
    "the transition radiation dominates in the soft part of the considered spectrum , while the bremsstrahlung under influence of the strong lpm effect dominates in the hard part .",
    "the intermediate region of the photon energies where contributions of the both mentioned mechanisms are of the same order is of evident interest .",

    "the case @xmath241 was considered in detail in our recent paper @xcite .",

    "the interference pattern appears at @xmath246mev where the formation length is longer than the thickness of one plate and the radiation process depends on the distance between plates @xmath151 .",
    "according to eqs.([42b ] ) , ( [ 43 ] ) the curves 1 - 5 have minimums at @xmath247 which are outside of fig.1 and will be discussed below . in accord with the above analysis the spectral curves in fig.1 have the maximums at photon energies @xmath248 .",

    "starting from @xmath259mev the contribution of the transition radiation dominates .",
    "the spectral curves for the transition radiation in fig.2 increase for @xmath260mev as @xmath261 according to eq.([53 ] ) and attain the maximal value at @xmath262mev ( see eq.([56 ] ) ) .",
    "the height of the spectral curves at this point within the logarithmic accuracy is independent of @xmath151 and roughly the same for all the curves .",
    "the minimums of the spectral curves are disposed at @xmath263mev according to eq.([55 ] ) from which it follows that in this point for larger @xmath151 the spectral curve is higher .",

    "the approach developed in this paper is applicable in the interval of photon energies where effects of the polarization of a medium are essential .",
    "it includes also the soft part of the lpm effect . for the case given in fig.1",
    "our results are given up to @xmath268mev .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite the hard part of the lpm effect spectrum was analyzed where one can neglect the effects of the polarization of a medium ( @xmath269mev for the mentioned case ) .",
    "although in our paper and in @xcite the different methods are used , the results obtained in overlapping regions are in a quite reasonable agreement among themselves .",
    "it is interesting to discuss behavior of the spectral curves obtained in @xcite from the point of view of our results .",
    "we consider the low value @xmath270 is not very large ) and a situation when corrections to the value @xmath154 in ( [ 48 ] ) which neglected in @xcite are less than @xmath271 .",
    "this leads to the difference in results less than @xmath272 .",
    "we concentrate on the case of gold target with the total thickness @xmath273 .",
    "the case @xmath84 where @xmath274mev , @xmath275mev is considered in detail in our paper @xcite .",
    "the curves in figures in @xcite are normalized on the bethe - heitler probability of radiation , i.e. they measured in units @xmath276 . in the region where our results are applicable @xmath277mev in fig.2@xmath278 of @xcite",
    "one can see plateau the ordinate of which is @xmath272 less than calculated according ( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "the case of two plates ( @xmath279mev ,  @xmath280mev ) is given in fig.3 of @xcite .",
    "the lengths of the gaps are the same as in our fig.1 , except @xmath281 .",
    "the positions and ordinates of the minimums and the maximums in the characteristic points ( @xmath282 for minimums and @xmath248 for maximums , see above ) as well as behavior of the spectral curves is described quite satisfactory by our formulas ( see e.g. asymptotic eqs.([40])-([42b ] ) ) .    in the case of four plates ( @xmath283mev , fig.4 of @xcite )",
    "the value @xmath154 is not enough small and we can do the qualitative analysis only . the curves in this figure correspond to the values @xmath284 according to eqs.([40])-([42b ] ) , ( [ 44 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath285 we have from ( [ 42b]):the first maximum is at @xmath286mev , the first minimum is at @xmath287mev , the next maximum is at @xmath288mev , the next minimum is at @xmath289mev , but it is rather obscure because of large value of @xmath290 .",
    "the accordance of these estimates of the characteristic points with the curve in the figure is quite satisfactory .",
    "let us note in conclusion that for observation of the interference pattern at large values @xmath154 which is described by eq.([34 ] ) ( see fig.3 ) one needs to use very thin plates ( @xmath291 ) .",
    "since the interference manifests itself in the terms @xmath292 only , the value @xmath154 should not be very large .",
    "it seems at first sight that in this situation one can use the light elements , e.g. lithium , for which the radiation length @xmath293 is large .",
    "however , these elements have low charge of nucleus @xmath294 and low density and because of this the lpm effect begins at @xmath295 which is close to @xmath296 where effects of the polarization of a medium are essential .",
    "so , one can expect that the optimal situation will be for elements in the middle of the periodic table of the elements .",
    "for example , for @xmath297 one has @xmath298 cm , @xmath299ev , and at energy @xmath300gev , @xmath301mev , @xmath302mev , @xmath303mev .",
    "taking @xmath304 we have @xmath305 m , @xmath306kev .",
    "in this situation there is rather wide interval of photon energies @xmath307 where the interference can be observed .",
    "if one wants to observe the interference pattern g(t ) given by fig.3 in the wide interval of @xmath308 , then one has to take into account that @xmath309 .",
    "in this situation one has @xmath310 acceptable parameters are @xmath311 . for @xmath312",
    "the amplitude of oscillation is very small , while for @xmath313 we have very distinct first maximum .",
    "so we have @xmath314 for the case considered .",
    "this work was supported in part by the russian fund of basic research under grant 98 - 02 - 17866 .",
    "we start calculation of @xmath51 ( [ 15 ] ) with lower terms @xmath315",
