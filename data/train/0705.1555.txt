    "it is instructive to make a link between our approach and the rigorous results which were obtained in refs .  .",
    "our equations , show that for the vortex ground state to exist , it is crucial to have both types of anisotropy : out - of - plane anisotropy and in - plane one .",

    "this constraint prevents the existence of the vortex ground state of the nanodot because the energy of the vortex in the continuum limit is infinite due to divergence at @xmath196 .",
    "however this divergence is removed by the out - of - plane component of vortex which is described by a localized function with radius of localization @xmath197 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "this means that the last term @xmath198 in scales like the exchange term @xmath199 . in this limit all three terms of are of the same order and provide the existence of the vortex ground state .",
