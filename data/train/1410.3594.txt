    "it is well known that the light received from the stars is linearly polarized by the photon scattering occurring in the stellar atmospheres .",
    "the mechanism is particularly effective for the hot stars that have a free electron atmosphere , giving rise to a maximum polarization degree that can be as high as about 12 percent at the stellar limb @xcite . by a minor extent ,",
    "polarization may be also induced in main sequence stars ( of late type ) by the scattering of star light off atoms and molecules @xcite and in evolved , cool giant stars by photon scattering on dust grains contained in their extended envelopes powered by strong stellar winds @xcite .",
    "the idea that the polarization could be enhanced by the microlensing effect at a level eventually above the instrumental threshold was first investigated in relation to supernovae by @xcite .",
    "then , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite presented a numerical calculation of the polarization induced by a single - lens ( the schwarzschild lens ) microlensing a hot source star .",
    "the maximum polarization degree was found to be about @xmath2 per cent .",
    "hence , @xcite calculated the time - dependent polarization of a hot star being microlensed by a binary system and found that polarization signals as high as @xmath3 percent can be achieved when the source crosses in the lens plane a caustic @xcite or passes near a cusp @xcite .    from an observational perspective",
    "the more promising line of sight for detecting polarization signals associated to microlensing events is that towards the galactic bulge where by now each year of order one thousand new events are reported , with the primary scientific goal being the search and characterization of exoplanets @xcite . along that line of sight , however , we expect a few or none hot giant source stars .",
    "rather , it is expected that the highest polarization signals occur for microlensed cool , giant stars endowed with extented dust grain envelopes @xcite .",
    "indeed , these evolved stars constitute a significant fraction of the lensed sources in events towards the galactic bulge , the lmc @xcite and the m31 galaxy @xcite .    a useful formalism to evaluate the polarization profiles towards microlensed cool giant source stars has been developed by @xcite for single lens events and by @xcite for binary events .",
    "it turned out that the polarization degree ultimately depends on the dust optical depth @xmath4 and that for large enough values of @xmath5 the polarization degree might become close to that expected for hot giant stars .    in a recent work @xcite a specific set of highly magnified ,",
    "single - lens events @xcite was considered along with a subset of exoplanetary events observed towards the galactic bulge @xcite . for these events",
    "the polarization profiles as a function of time were calculated , taking into account the nature of the source stars ( a main sequence of late type or a cool giant star ) and it was shown that the currently available technology may potentially allow the detection of such signals .    besides the interest related to stellar astrophysics , the observation of the polarization variability may in principle provide independent constraints on the lensing parameters .",
    "indeed , it was shown @xcite that polarization measurementes may allow to distinguish between binary and exoplanetary and smaller star - to - planet distance @xmath6 as compared to the separation of the stars in a binary system . ]",
    "lens solutions that are degenerate solutions when looking merely to the observed light curves .    in the present paper , also in view of the fact that highly magnified events considered in our previous works are not so frequent , we extend the analysis of the expected polarization signal for single lens events towards the galactic bulge , covering the full range of microlensing parameters .",
    "concerning the polarization mechanism in operation , it is clear from our analysis @xcite that , due to paucity of hot stars in the galactic bulge , the source stars with the highest chance to give rise to a non negligible polarization signal are cool , evolved giants , for which the photon scattering on dust grains is the leading polarization mechanism .",
    "therefore , following the model by @xcite , briefly summarized in sect .",
    "2 , we assume that dust grains may form in the stellar atmospheres , beyond the distance @xmath7 greater than the source radius @xmath8 , at which the gas temperature becomes lower than the dust sublimation temperature",
    ". the model is characterized by the presence of an internal cavity ( between @xmath8 and @xmath7 ) devoid of dust , giving rise during a microlensing event to two different polarization profiles , as a function of the time @xmath9 , for _ bypass _ and _ transit _ events @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the trajectory ( projected in the lens plane ) of the cavity remains outside the lens ( _ bypass _ events ) , one obtains a bell - like polarization profile with the peak occurring at the instant of maximum magnification @xmath10 .",
    "when a part of the cavity is aligned with the lens and the observer ( _ transit _ events ) , the polarization curve presents two maxima and one minimum ( in correspondence to @xmath10 ) .",
    "the polarization signal gets the two maximum values when the cavity enters and exits the lens .",
    "note that a major advantage of considering the polarization ( namely the microlensing of the envelope instead of the stellar disk ) is that the probability for observing finite source effects in microlensing events increases @xcite . indeed , in the case of _ bypass _ events ,",
    "for which the trajectory of the source disk does not intersects the lens , the finite source effects , negligible on the event light - curves - that are not sensitive to the limb - darkening phenomena @xcite - produce a polarization signal that constitute , therefore , a unique probe of the stellar atmosphere . in _ transit _ events for which the source disk transverses the lens , the finite source effects manifest themselves in the polarization variability when the internal cavity transits the lens , while in the light - curves their effects may appear or not depending on the sensitivity of the light - curve to the limb - darkening phenomenon @xcite .",
    "our present analysis of the polarization runs along two parallel paths , the first being a study of the signal present in microlensing events generated by using a monte carlo code .",
    "this preliminary study allows us to clarify the dependence of the polarization signal on the microlensing parameters and the physical parameters of the source stars .",
    "then we consider the set of ogle - iii events relative to the 2001 - 2009 observational campaign towards the galactic bulge recently reported in @xcite with an evaluation of the expected polarization signal .",
    "this analysis is however complemented by a monte carlo study , since the observational data alone do not allow us to completely characterize the polarization signal .",
    "the overall analysis eventually leads us to determine the physics that can be extracted by the study of the polarization as well as the optimal observational strategy for forthcoming microlensing events . indeed",
    ", our final aim is to design an observational strategy which allows us to maximize the chance of positive polarization measurements with an observational programme based on the current microlensing surveys . to this aim",
    "we consider the ogle - iii event catalog recently presented by @xcite .",
    "all these available data allow to compute the maximum polarization degree in each of the observed events and the best time to perform a polarization measurement in an ongoing event , once an alert system has predicted the instant of the occurrence of the magnification peak .",
    "this , in turn , also makes possible to estimate that for a few events per year ( about 1 percent of the ogle - iii events ) the fors2 polarimeter on vlt telescope , in 1 hour of integration time , may allow to obtain a positive polarization measurement with @xmath11 percent ( see sect .",
    "following the approach in @xcite , we consider the linear polarization of the star light scattered in a stellar atmosphere .",
    "we define the intensities @xmath12 and @xmath13 emitted in the direction making an angle @xmath14 with the normal to the star surface and polarized as follows : @xmath12 is the intensity in the plane containing the line of sight and the normal , @xmath13 is the intensity in the direction perpendicular to this plane ( light propagates in the direction @xmath15 ) .    to calculate the polarization of a star with center at projected position @xmath16 in the lens plane we integrate the unnormalized stokes parameters and the flux over the star disk @xcite @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unamplified star flux , @xmath21",

    "the location of a point @xmath27 on the star surface is determined by the distance @xmath28 from the star center and by the angle @xmath29 formed with the @xmath30 axis .",

    "it turns out that the ratio @xmath86 determines both the strength ( apart the dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath4 ) and the shape of the expected polarization signal .    in particular , when @xmath162 , i.e. for _ bypass _ events , the polarization @xmath161 shows a bell - like profile with the peak occurring at @xmath10 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the actual value of @xmath163 depends on the ratio @xmath86 , being @xmath164 percent at @xmath165 .    for @xmath166 ,",
    "i.e. for _ transit _ events , the polarization curve presents a central minimum ( in correspondance to @xmath10 ) , while two maxima occur at the time instants @xmath167 at which the internal cavity ( of the stellar atmosphere devoid of dust , projected in the lens plane ) enters and exits the lens .",
    "the maximum polarization degree is again @xmath168 percent , corresponding to a lens - source projected distance @xmath169 .",
    "clearly , with this in mind , one can predict in advance for which events and at which time the observing resources may be focused to make a polarization measurement in an ongoing microlensing event .",
    "the monte carlo analysis shows how @xmath130 depends on the stellar parameters ( see figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) : @xmath130 increases from ( late type ) main sequence to agb star phase increasing from @xmath170 up to values of a few percent .",
    "our analysis also shows that the _ transit _ events have a higher polarization degree with respect to _ bypass _ ones and that the same level of @xmath171 is achieved irrespectively on the @xmath42 value .",
    "however , the combined analysis with the ogle - iii events clearly shows the absence of events with expected polarization @xmath172 percent , as a consequence of the paucity of agb stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "therefore , an observational programme devoted to measure the polarization in an ongoing microlensing event must be designed to be able to measure a polarization degree @xmath173 percent , that is the threshold value ( in 1 hour integration time ) for the fors2 polarimeter at vlt telescope . stated this",
    ", we find that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , about two dozen of events ( about 1 percent of the ogle - iii events ) have @xmath174 percent and apparent magnitude @xmath175 at the instant @xmath92 of the polarization peak .",
    "this makes realistic the possibility to measure the polarization in about a few events per year with the present observational capabilities ( ogle - iii like ) .",
    "of course , increasing the event rate ( up to thousands per year ) as expected in the forthcoming programs euclid , wfirst and kmtnet , the chance to pick - up events with large ( @xmath176 percent ) polarization correspondingly increases .     after the initial submission of the present manuscript @xcite presented an analysis of the expected polarization signal in the ogle - iii data set .",
    "although discussed within a different framework of our analysis , their main conclusions are in agreement with those discussed in the present work .",
    "specifically , a few percent of microlensing events towards the galactic bulge may indeed show up detectable polarization signals .",

    "we also thank the anonimous referee for useful comments . this work make use of the iac - star synthetic cmd computational code .",
