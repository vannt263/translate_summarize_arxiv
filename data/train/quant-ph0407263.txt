    "since the fast quantum algorithms were developed , the quantum information and computation have aroused great enthusiasm among physicists because of their potential applications .",
    "the basic unit of the classical information is a bit , which can only have a choice between two possible classical states denoted by @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the information carriers in the quantum communication and computation are called quantum bits or qubits .",
    "the main difference between the qubit and the classical bit is that the qubit is defined as a quantum superposition of two orthogonal quantum states usually written as @xmath2 and @xmath3 called as the computational basis states .",
    "it means that the qubit has an infinite number of choices of the states @xmath4 with the condition @xmath5 .",
    "it is obvious that the superposition principle allows application of quantum states to simultaneously represent many different numbers , this is called the quantum parallelism , which enables the quantum computation to solve some problems , such as factorization , intractable on a classical computer .",
    "however , a pure quantum superposition state is very fragile . a quantum system can not be isolated from the environment , it is always open and interacts with the uncontrollable environment .",
    "this unwanted interaction induces entanglement between the quantum system and the environment such that the pure superposition state is destroyed , which results in an inevitable noise in the quantum computation and information processing . unlike a closed system",
    ", whose final state @xmath6 can be obtained by a unitary transformation @xmath7 of the initial state @xmath8 as @xmath9 , the final state of an open system can not be described by a unitary transformation of the initial state .",
    "quantum operation formalism is usually used to describe the behavior of an open quantum system in which the final state @xmath6 and the initial state @xmath8 can be related by a quantum operation @xmath10 as @xmath11 . in general ,",
    "the quantum operation @xmath10 on the state @xmath8 can be described by the kraus operator - sum formalism  @xcite as @xmath12 where the operation elements @xmath13 satisfy the completeness relation @xmath14 .",
    "operators @xmath15 act on the hilbert space @xmath16 of the system .",
    "they can be expressed as @xmath17 by the total unitary operator @xmath18 of the system and the environment with an orthonormal basis @xmath19 for the hilbert space @xmath20 and the initial state @xmath21 of the environment .",
    "this elegant representation is extensively applied to describe the quantum information processing  @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "the environment effect on the quantum system is a more complicated problem .",
    "there are two ideal models of noise called the amplitude and phase damping , which can capture many important features of the noise  @xcite .",
    "they are applied in many concrete discussions to model noise of the quantum information processing , e.g. , reference  @xcite . as a system ,",
    "a single - mode harmonic oscillator is the simplest and most ideal model to represent a single mode light field , vibration phonon mode , or excitonic wave . for convenience",
    ", we refer this harmonic oscillator to a single - mode light field in this paper .",
    "a study of a single harmonic oscillator suffering from damping is expected to give us an easier grasp of the nature of damping .",
    "the kraus representation of a harmonic oscillator suffering from the above two kinds of noise has been given by chuang _",

    "however generally speaking , the environment is usually described as a system of multimode oscillators for both the phase damping and amplitude damping .",

    "although there are many studies about kraus representation , e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite , to the best of our knowledge , there is no proof of the kraus representation for a harmonic oscillator suffering from amplitude damping or phase damping by directly using its definition when the environment is modeled as a system of multimode oscillators . in view of the importance of the kraus representation in the quantum information",
    ", we would like to revisit this question in this paper .",
    "we will extend the proof of chuang _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "that is , we will give the kraus representation using a simple operator algebra method by modeling the system as a single mode oscillator and the environment as multimode oscillators according to the definition of the kraus representation .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give the kraus representation for the amplitude damping case , then we discuss the effect of the environment on a qubit whose computational basis is defined by odd and even coherent states with decay of at most one particle , we compare this result with that of a qubit defined by vacuum and single photon number states . in sec .",
    "iii , we give the kraus representation for the phase damping case , and explain its effect .",
    "similar to the analysis in sec .",
    "ii , we also compare the effect of the phase damping on the entangled qubit defined by different states .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "one of the most important reasons for the quantum state change is the energy dissipation of the system induced by the environment .",
    "this energy dissipation can be characterized by an amplitude damping model .",
    "ideally we can model the system , for example , a single mode cavity field , as a harmonic oscillator , which is coupled to the environment modeled as multimode oscillators .",
    "then the whole hamiltonian of the system and the environment can be written as @xmath22 under the rotating wave approximation , where @xmath23 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the @xmath26th mode of the environment with frequency @xmath27 , @xmath28 is coupling constant between the system and the @xmath26th mode of the environment .",
    "we assume that the initial state of the whole system is @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the initial states of the system and environment respectively . with the time evolution",
    ", the initial state evolves into @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "since we are only interested in the time evolution of the system , we perform a partial trace over the environment and find the reduced density operator of the system as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space @xmath20 for the environment , and @xmath36 denotes that there are @xmath36 bosonic particles in the @xmath26th mode .",
    "we assume that the environment is at zero temperature , so its initial state is in the vacuum state @xmath37 of multimode harmonic oscillators .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath20 can be decomposed into a direct sum of many orthogonal subspaces @xmath38 as @xmath39 with an orthonormal basis @xmath40 , which satisfies the condition @xmath41 for each subspace @xmath38 .",
    "so we can regroup the summation in eq.([4 ] ) and define the quantum operation element @xmath42 as follows @xmath43 which acts on the hilbert space @xmath16 of the system .",
    "hereafter , @xmath44 stands for summation under the condition @xmath45 ; @xmath46 means that there are @xmath47 bosonic particles absorbed by the environment through the evolution over a finite time @xmath48 , and @xmath49 denotes the hermitian conjugate of @xmath46 .",
    "then eq.([4 ] ) can be rewritten by virtue of the operation elements @xmath46 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath49 as a concise form called the kraus representation  @xcite @xmath50 it is very easy to check that the elements @xmath46 satisfy the relation @xmath51 . in order to further give the solution of the operator @xmath46",
    ", we first use the number state @xmath52 of the system to define an orthonormal basis @xmath53 of the hilbert space @xmath16 of the system .",
    "then the matrix representation of the operator @xmath46 can be written as @xmath54 with the matrix element @xmath55 because the state @xmath56 can be written as @xmath57^{n}/\\sqrt{n!}|\\{0\\}\\rangle|0\\rangle$ ] . using the wigner - weisskopf approximation  @xcite ,",

    "we can use eq.([eq:9 ] ) to expand @xmath56 as many terms characterized by the particle number @xmath47 lost from the system , and each term with fixed @xmath47 can be expressed as @xmath65^{n - k}&&\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{k!}\\left ( \\begin{array}{c}n \\\\k \\end{array}\\right ) } \\sum_{i_{1}\\cdots\\neq i_{q}\\cdots \\neq i_{k}=0}^{\\infty } \\sum_{\\{l_{i}\\}}^{k}{'}\\ , \\frac{k!}{l_{1}!\\cdots l_{k}!}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times \\prod_{q=1}^{k } \\left(v^{*}_{i_{q}}(t)b^{\\dagger}_{i_{q}}(0)\\right)^{l_{q}}|\\ { 0\\}\\rangle|n - k\\rangle . \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using eqs.([7])-([9 ] ) , we can obtain the product of the matrix elements of @xmath66 and its hermitian conjugate as @xmath67^{(n - k)}[1-\\eta(t)]^{k}\\delta_{m , n - k}\\ ] ] with @xmath68 , where we have used the completeness of the subspace with fixed @xmath47 @xmath69 and condition @xmath70 , which comes from the commutation relation @xmath71=1 $ ] .",

    "using a single qubit @xmath8 defined by the bosonic number state @xmath81 as the computational basis states , we can simply demonstrate how to give its kraus representation when it suffers from the amplitude damping . by eq.([133 ] ) , it is very easy to find that the quantum operation on qubit @xmath8 includes only two operational elements @xmath82 and @xmath83 , that is    @xmath84    with    [ eq:166 ] @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the probability that the system lose one particle up to time @xmath48 .      in this subsection",
    ", we will demonstrate an application of the above conclusions about the kraus representation .",
    "we know that two kinds of logical qubits , whose computational basis states are defined by using the bosonic even and odd coherent states  @xcite or vacuum and bosonic single particle number states , are accessible in experiments . for brevity , we refer to qubits defined via the even and odd coherent states as the ( schrdinger ) cat - state qubits by contrast to the fock - state qubits defined by vacuum and single - photon states in the following expressions .",
    "it has been shown that the bit flip errors caused by a single decay event , which results from the spontaneous emissions , are more easily corrected by a standard error correction circuit for the logical qubit defined by the bosonic even and odd coherent states  @xcite than that defined by the bosonic vacuum and single particle number states .",
    "we know that the entangled qubit takes an important role in the quantum information processing .",
    "so in the following , we will study the effect of the environment on entangled qubits defined by the above two kinds of computational basis states when they are subject to at most one decay event caused by the amplitude damping .",
    "let @xmath87 be a bosonic coherent state ( we denote this single bosonic mode as a single - mode light field , but it can be generalized to any bosonic mode , for example , excitonic mode , vibrational mode of trap ions and so on ) . in general , if a single - mode light field , which is initially in the coherent state @xmath87 , suffers from amplitude damping , the kraus operation element ( [ 133 ] ) changes it as follows @xmath88 $ ] , can be written as @xmath89=|\\sqrt{\\eta}\\alpha\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which means that the coherent state remains coherent under the amplitude damping , but its amplitude @xmath90 is reduced to @xmath91 due to the interaction with the environment .",
    "now we define a logical zero - qubit state @xmath92 and a logical one - qubit state @xmath93 using the even and odd coherent states as @xmath94 and subscript @xmath95 denotes the logical state . if we know that the system loses at most one photon with the time evolution but we do not have the detailed information on the lost photons .",
    "then , we only need to calculate two kraus operators @xmath82 and @xmath83 corresponding to no - photon and single - photon decay events , respectively .",
    "no - photon decay event changes the logical qubits @xmath92 and @xmath93 as follows    @xmath96=n^{\\prime}_{-}\\left(|\\sqrt{\\eta}\\alpha\\rangle-     where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are normalized states of @xmath99 and @xmath100 with the normalized constants @xmath101 .",
    "it is obvious that no - photon decay event reduces only the intensity of the logical qubit , leaving the even and odd properties of the logical qubit states unchanged .",
    "a simple analysis of how the noisy channel affects the original quantum state can be made by calculating the fidelity defined as the average value of the final reduced density matrix @xmath102 with initial pure state @xmath103 , that is @xmath104 .",
    "the fidelity @xmath105 of the qubit state ( [ 16 ] ) with no - photon decay event can be obtained as @xmath106 with @xmath107 , which denotes zero - qubit state or one - qubit state .",
    "but for a single - photon decay event , we can have the following @xmath108,\\\\    n}[a_{2m}|0\\rangle_{l}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath109 , which means that the even number of photons decay event only reduces the intensity of the logical signal , and keeps the even and odd properties of the logical state unchanged ; but the odd number of photons decay event flips a qubit causing error and reduces the intensity of the qubit signal .",
    "if the coherent amplitude of the cat states is infinitely large , that is , @xmath110 , then we find that the fidelity @xmath111 with a larger @xmath80 , so under this condition , we can say that the no - photon decay event essentially leaves the logical qubit states unchanged and the single - photon decay event causes a qubit flip error .",
    "it means that the use of the even and odd coherent states as logical qubit states @xmath92 and @xmath93 is better than the use of the vacuum state @xmath2 and single - photon state @xmath3 as logical qubit states in the amplitude damping channel with a few photons loss .",
    "because the single - photon decay event changes vacuum and single - photon states to @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the single - photon decay event is an irreversible process for vacuum and single - photon states .",
    "an entangled pair of qubits , whose computational basis states are defined by the even and odd coherent states ( [ 16 ] ) , can be written as @xmath114 with @xmath82 an @xmath83 determined by eq.([133 ] ) , the entangled qubit ( [ eq:266 ] ) becomes the following mixed state @xmath115 with @xmath116 and the normalized constant @xmath117 the fidelity @xmath118 of the entangled qubit @xmath119 with at most one photon decay for each mode can be calculated as @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 . then we obtain the fidelity @xmath123 as @xmath124 we can find that the logical state @xmath92 and @xmath93 in eq.([eq:266 ] ) can be reduced to the vacuum state @xmath2 and single - photon state @xmath3 , respectively in the limit of the weak light field @xmath125 .",

    "when the qubit states , whose computational basis is defined by the even and odd coherent states , enter the phase damping channels , the even and odd properties will not be changed , however all off - diagonal terms of the qubit density matrices gradually vanish . then the originally pure states change into mixtures of states because of the random scattering of the environment on the system even without loss of photons .",

    "<S> by definition , the kraus representation of a harmonic oscillator suffering from the environment effect , modeled as the amplitude damping or the phase damping , is directly given by a simple operator algebra solution . </S>",
    "<S> as examples and applications , we first give a kraus representation of a single qubit whose computational basis states are defined as bosonic vacuum and single particle number states . </S>",
    "<S> we further discuss the environment effect on qubits whose computational basis states are defined as the bosonic odd and even coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> the environment effects on entangled qubits defined by two different kinds of computational basis are compared with the use of fidelity . </S>"
