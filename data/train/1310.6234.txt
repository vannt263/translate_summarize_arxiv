    "coulomb interaction and plasmarons in both single layer graphene@xcite and bilayer graphene@xcite have attracted recently a lot of interest .",
    "one of the reasons is that it was found experimentally that , for instance in monolayer graphene@xcite the accepted view of linear ( dirac - like ) spectrum does not provide a sufficiently accurate picture of the charge carrying excitations in this material .",
    "the concept of a quasiparticle named `` plasmaron '' , was introduced which is in fact a bound state of charge carriers with plasmons .",
    "the motivation behind the interest in this kind of studies is that exploring the physics of interaction between electrons and plasmons may lead to realizations of `` plasmonic '' devices which merge photonics and electronics . in earlier experiments ,",
    "this more complicated picture of the band structure was not observed because of the low quality and low mobility of old samples .",
    "the interest in similar phenomena in bilayer graphene is equally high .",
    "coulomb interaction and electronic screening was probed in bilayer and multilayer graphene using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) in ref .  .",
    "recently , sensarma _ _ et al.__@xcite investigated plasmarons and the quantum spectral function in bilayer graphene theoretically .",
    "the authors of that reference predicted a broad plasmaron peak away from the fermi surface .",
    "similar findings were reported in ref .   where thermal green s functions in both random phase approximation and self - consistent gw approximation were used to determine the spectral function .",
    "bilayer graphene shares some properties with both graphene and the two - dimensional electron gas found in common semiconductors .",
    "while the energy dispersion in graphene is linear in momentum , in bilayer graphene it is nearly quadratic .",
    "the advantage of bilayer graphene over usual semiconductors is that its charge carrier density can be controlled by the application of a gate voltage over orders of magnitude and this from electrons to holes .",
    "furthermore , the band gap can be tuned to meet requirements for several device applications .    in this paper",
    ", we employ an alternative approach in order to determine the energy spectrum of bilayer graphene .",
    "the approach is based on second order perturbation theory of the electron - plasmon interaction and the problem is cast into a field theoretical problem . by doing so , one is able to evaluate the correction to the band structure which comes as a consequence of the interaction of charge carriers with plasmons . as far as the interaction between plasmons and charge carriers",
    "is concerned , we generalize the overhauser approach@xcite to the two - dimensional electron gas in bilayer graphene .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in sec .  [",
    "theory ] we present the theoretical model and give pertinent expressions for the interaction and the coupling between electrons and plasmons in bilayer graphene . in the subsequent section , sec .",
    "[ results ] , the numerical calculations of the energy correction due to the interaction with plasmons are presented for various doping levels , i.e. charge carrier density .",
    "the influence of the doping level is analyzed and discussed .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and present the conclusions in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "if the relevant energy scale in bilayer graphene is smaller than the interlayer hopping parameter @xmath2 , one may use the low energy limit . in this limit",
    ", the problem can be reduced to the effective two - band model and the corresponding hamiltonian reads@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the fermi velocity and @xmath5 .",
    "the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ ham0 ] ) are well known and read @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "here we introduced the effective mass @xmath8 in the low energy limit , and @xmath9 .",
    "please note that we are interested in energies larger than @xmath10 such that the usual warping is not important .",
    "it is well known that graphene structures may sustain quanta of collective charge excitations of the electron gas , i.e. plasmons , due to the restoring force of the long - range @xmath11 coulomb interaction . however in contrast to the usual two - dimensional electron gas , the `` dirac plasma '' is manifestly of quantum nature@xcite .",
    "for instance , in single layer graphene the plasma frequency is proportional to @xmath12 , and does not have a classical limit independent of the planck constant . as far as bilayer graphene is concerned the plasma frequency ( in the long wavelength limit ) is given by@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dielectric constant of the material and is related to the one of the substrate , @xmath15 for @xmath16 substrate .",
    "the excitations of the electron gas are represented by a scalar field previously described by overhauser@xcite for the @xmath17d electron gas .",
    "the correction in the electron spectrum are calculated analogously as for the polaron problem where now a test charge interacts with the plasmon field .",
    "the interaction of an electron displaced from the graphene layer with plasmons was treated in our earlier work@xcite , and the interaction term of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 where the electron - plasmon interaction matrix element is@xcite @xmath19 its value can be determined using the @xmath20-sum rule applied to the case of interest .",
    "the starting point is the fact that the expectation value of the double commutator @xmath21|0\\rangle$ ] can be evaluated in two different ways@xcite .",
    "first , it is known that the relation @xmath22 holds for an arbitrary commutator with the hamiltonian , @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "second , it can easily be proven that @xmath24|0\\rangle=2\\sum_{n}\\hbar\\omega_{n0}|\\langle n|n_{\\mathbf{q}}|0\\rangle|^{2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "further , the explicit evaluation of the double commutator yields @xmath26 the @xmath20-sum rule then reduces to @xmath27 on combining relations in eqs .",
    "( [ vq1]-[vq4 ] ) we arrive at the expression for the interaction matrix element @xmath28 where @xmath1 is the electron concentration , @xmath29 .",
    "note that @xmath30 is not the bare plasmon frequency but is altered by the polarization of the electron gas .",
    "we need the dielectric function of the electron in order to determine @xmath30 .",
    "it can be shown that in the long wavelength limit ( @xmath31 ) and within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) the dielectric function can be approximated by the following relation@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the screening wavevector@xcite and given by @xmath34 while @xmath35 is the density of states of bilayer graphene , @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the degeneracy factors for spin and valley degrees of freedom . the previous relation , eq .",
    "( [ epsqe2 ] ) is obtained from the general relation @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the fourier transform of the two - dimensional coulomb interaction , and @xmath41 is the @xmath42d polarizability .",
    "finally , the actual plasmon frequency is given by@xcite @xmath43    now , we are ready to evaluate the correction in the energy spectrum due to the interaction between electrons and plasmons .",
    "this will be carried out by employing second order perturbation theory , and for the case of bilayer graphene it reads    @xmath44    where @xmath45 stands for the principal value .",
    "the cut - off value for the momentum @xmath46 was taken to be @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the lattice constant .",
    "note that this correction is given within non - degenerate rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory ( rspt ) .",
    "however , for certain values of the plasmon wavevector @xmath46 a degeneracy occurs when @xmath49 .",
    "because of this degeneracy , improved wigner brillouin perturbation theory@xcite ( iwbpt ) can be employed to tackle this problem . the main idea behind this method is to ensure enhanced convergence when the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ corre ] ) approaches zero , which is realized by adding the term @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is evaluated within rspt ) ,    @xmath52    equation .",
    "( [ correiw ] ) should be solved self - consistently since @xmath53 appears on both sides of the equation .",
    "note that @xmath54 due to the isotropic nature of the spectrum . in the following section the value of @xmath55 will be calculated numerically for concrete values of the doping level , permittivity and other parameters of the material . as pointed out in ref .",
    "the plasmon excitation in graphene of the dirac sea remains pretty much well defined even when it penetrates the interband particle - hole continuum .",
    "this is because the transitions near the bottom of the interband particle - hole continuum have almost parallel wavevectors @xmath56 and @xmath57 and therefore carry negligible charge - fluctuation weight .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for bilayer graphene . in practice",
    ", the damping can be important for very large momentum @xmath58 , but then the contribution to the energy shift , i.e. to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ correiw ] ) is small .",
    "the correction to the energy , @xmath55 , vs electron momentum @xmath59 , for three values of the doping level @xmath60 ( solid curve ) , @xmath61 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath62 ( dotted curve).,width=302 ]",
    "the numerical calculations are carried out for doped bilayer graphene , with varying electron concentration .",
    "first we give in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the results for the energy correction @xmath63 for three levels of doping@xcite : @xmath64 ( solid curve ) , @xmath61 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath65 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the shift increases with the electron momentum .",
    "the increase with @xmath56 is more rapid than in the case of single layer graphene@xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to what was found in refs .   and where a broad peak was attributed to plasmarons .",
    "while the explicit dependence on the concentration is the same @xmath66 , the interaction matrix element is related to the doping level also through the plasmon frequency .",
    "the latter in single layer graphene is mainly proportional to @xmath67 while in bilayer graphene is @xmath68 .",
    "further , the effective plasmon frequency is modulated through the polarization of the surrounding electron gas .",
    "one should not forget that a property of bilayer graphene , important for the present analysis , is the fact that the coupling parameter is a function of the carrier density @xmath69 ( while in single layer graphene it is independent of @xmath1 ) .",
    "more precisely , the strength of the coulomb interaction is tunable and depends on the level of doping . as for the comparison with earlier theoretical findings , we got @xmath70 for @xmath64 while the authors of ref .   obtained the value @xmath71 .",
    "the correction to the energy @xmath72 for @xmath73 , vs the electron concentration @xmath1.,width=302 ]    unlike the case of polarons in conventional semiconductors , here it is not straightforward to derive any approximate analytical relation for @xmath55 at small @xmath59 .",
    "this is due to the fact that plasmons here have a more complicated dispersion relation , and the fact that the interaction strength @xmath74 depends on @xmath46 in a non - trivial manner .",
    "thus we will treat eq .",
    "( [ corre ] ) numerically and one may write for small @xmath59 @xmath75 we fitted eq .",
    "( [ apprde ] ) to our numerical results within the range @xmath76 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath60 the fitting parameters are @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "ratio between the effective mass of the plasmaron band and the electron as a function of the electron concentration @xmath1 .",
    "the dashed curves show the low and high density asymptotics.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the result for the energy correction @xmath72 at @xmath73 , vs doping of bilayer graphene , i.e. the electron concentration @xmath1 . as can be seen , the absolute value of @xmath72 increases with the electron concentration .",
    "this is mainly the consequence of the dependence of the matrix element @xmath74 on @xmath1 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eqvq ] ) and ( [ epsqe1 ] ) ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier the relation is complicated since the plasmon frequency is modified through the polarization of the electron gas .",
    "we note that the obtained results for the energy shift on the concentration can be fitted ( for @xmath79 ) to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( @xmath1 is given @xmath85 and @xmath72 in @xmath86 ) .",
    "it would be instructive to determine the effective mass of the plasmaron band defined by @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the dependence of the effective mass ratio @xmath88 on the electron concentration .",
    "the ratio starts from a value around @xmath42 and and drops rapidly to @xmath89 while for @xmath90 it converges slowly to @xmath91 .",
    "the low and high density behavior fits are shown by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and were fitted respectively to the following expressions : @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , for @xmath95 .",
    "note that the large dispersion of the plasmaron band was also revealed in recent theoretical investigation of the spectral function@xcite , where it was determined that plasmarons do have a broad peak .",
    "in this paper we investigated the interaction between an electron and the collective excitation of the electron gas , i.e. plasmons , in bilayer graphene by using a field - theoretical approach .",
    "this interaction is modeled by generalizing the overhauser approach @xcite to the @xmath42deg in this material .",
    "we evaluated the energy correction , that is the shift in the energy spectrum as a result of this interaction .",
    "we employed second order perturbation theory in order to determine the energy of the plasmaron , which is a composite quasi - particle , i.e. a bound state of an electron with plasmons .",
    "the motivation behind the present study are the increased interest in the spectral function of bilayer graphene@xcite , and the prediction of the existence of a broad plasmaron peak away@xcite , but near the fermi surface .",
