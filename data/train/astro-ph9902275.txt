    "the so - called born approximation has been assumed ( see for a discussion ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath10 is a valuable quantity for cosmology .",
    "one can derive important constraints on the cosmological density parameters @xmath11 s through the dependence of @xmath10 on the global geometrical distances and the evolution of @xmath4 on the line cone .",
    "a commonly used statistic is its second moment @xmath12 , or the two - point correlation function @xmath13 .",

    "it is customary to consider @xmath15 as a function of angular scale @xmath16 , assuming @xmath10 is first smoothed on scale @xmath16 .",
    "however , future weak lensing surveys are likely to yield measurements of @xmath15 first on small angular scales , @xmath17 , both because the small - scale shear signal is stronger and also because of larger sampling fluctuations on large scales ( see e.g. , jsw ) . for sources at a redshift of @xmath18 , the peak contributions",
    "to the lensing signal will come from @xmath19 , which for @xmath20 translates into a comoving length scale of less than a few mpc that is generally comparable to or smaller than the nonlinear scale ( where the rms density fluctuation is of order unity ) .",
    "it is therefore expected that the perturbative treatment of bernardeau et al .",
    "@xcite would not hold for these angular scales of interest .",
    "this has in fact been explicitly demonstrated by jsw using the technique of ray - tracing n - body simulations ( see their fig .",

    "unfortunately , the prediction of skewness from n - body simulations can become prohibitively expensive , if one is interested in exploring a large number of cosmological models .",
    "there is therefore a need for alternative methods to predict accurately and efficiently the small - scale skewness .",

    ". we will then apply it to cosmological models that have not been considered before in the context of weak lensing .",
    "in particular , we will predict the small angular - scale skewness for a quintessence model , where quintessence is a component of the cosmological fluid that has negative pressure ( e.g. ) .",
    "such models , which include the cosmological constant dominated models as a limiting case , are currently in favor in part because of recent type ia supernova measurements ( ) .",

    ", we need to understand the nonlinear evolution of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the nonlinear behavior of @xmath48 can be described by a scaling ansatz introduced by hamilton et al .",
    "@xcite , which was later extended by jain et al . @xcite and peacock & dodds @xcite .",
    "we will employ the latest version set out in the latter .",
    "jain & seljak @xcite have considered the two - point version of @xmath59 using this ansatz .",

    ", it has been conjectured for some time that the following scaling approximately holds in the highly nonlinear regime ( e.g. ): @xmath69 where the three @xmath52 s form a closed triangle , and @xmath70 is a weak function of scale but independent of the triangle configuration .",
    "the above nonlinear hierarchical form ( sometimes called the hierarchical ansatz ) is also observed in n - body simulations ( see and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "the problem , however , was that , there has been for a long time no way to predict the amplitude of @xmath70 , other than by examining n - body simulations on a case by case basis .",
    "recently , scoccimarro & frieman @xcite introduced a method they named hyperextended perturbation theory which allows one to calculate @xmath70 analytically : @xmath71/[1 + 2^{n+1 } ] \\label{q3}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the _ linear _ power spectral index at the scale of interest @xmath73 .",
    "the above expression implies that @xmath70 is insensitive to cosmology , except through @xmath72 ( see ) .",

    "this approximation works in part because @xmath70 varies slowly with scale , on the relevant small scales .    in fig .",
    "[ skew_comp]a , we show a comparison of the skewness computed as described above with the skewness obtained from ray - tracing n - body simulations ( jsw ) , for sources at @xmath18 .",

    "three models are shown ( see table [ table ] ) .",
    "they are all normalized to match the cluster abundance today .",
    "the agreement is good , to better than @xmath77 for @xmath78 , and it remains reasonable at larger angular scales , although its exact level is somewhat uncertain because of the large dispersions of the n - body results .",
    "the agreement here is to be contrasted with the as much as @xmath79 discrepancy for the perturbation theory predictions , shown as points on the far left of fig .",
    "[ skew_comp]a .",
    "in particular , perturbation theory brings @xmath15 for ocdm and lcdm much closer than what it should be ( the good agreement of the perturbative @xmath15 with the actual value for lcdm seems to be a coincidence ) . it is interesting how nonlinear clustering makes it easier to tell them apart .",
    "there seems to be a complicated interplay of projection and nonlinear clustering ( e.g. ) .",
    "our ocdm predictions seem to be systematically a little higher than the n - body results , but it should be kept in mind that measurements at different scales are correlated and that a measurement - bias due to a division of estimators might be present ( ) .",
    "the accuracy of our method is actually somewhat surprising because of the inherent approximate nature of the prescription for @xmath70 ( eq . [ [ q3 ] ] ) and of the scaling ansatz for the power spectrum evolution .",
    "moreover , the weakly nonlinear fluctuations , which do not obey the hierarchical form with a configuration independent @xmath70 as in eq . ( [ q3def ] ) , must contribute at some level to the relevant integrals for @xmath15 . to check this , we perform an alternative integration for @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ s3cal ] ) by including only nonlinear modes : taking the lower limit of integration to be @xmath80 instead of @xmath81 , where @xmath80 satisfies @xmath82 .",
    "let us call the resulting integral @xmath83 , and define @xmath84 .",
    "we find that @xmath85 is very similar for all 3 models above , and is about @xmath86 at @xmath87 , reaching about @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "we therefore propose the following self - consistency check : @xmath85 should be less than about @xmath79 for our method to yield reliable estimates of @xmath15 .",

    "it is clear that such a survey can separate these 3 models very nicely .",
    "note , however , systematic errors have not been taken into account .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , we show in the same figure our prediction of @xmath15 for a cluster - normalized ( ) quintessence model ( qcdm , see table [ table ] ) . the equation of state ( @xmath92 ) is motivated by certain models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking ( e.g. ) .",
    "fluctuations in the quintessence component have been ignored , which is probably a good approximation on the small scales of interest ( ) .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite have argued that current observations can not tell apart qcdm models with @xmath93 from lcdm models , for @xmath94 .",
    "future microwave background experiments would be able to provide better constraints , but there exist significant degeneracies , especially if @xmath23 is allowed to vary ( ) . the skewness has the advantage that it is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "[ skew_comp]b shows that the small angular - scale convergence skewness ( especially at @xmath95 ) provides a promising way to disentangle qcdm and lcdm models : fixing @xmath0 , @xmath15 varies smoothly from the qcdm values shown to the lcdm values as @xmath96 changes from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , it is a very clean test , because the small - scale @xmath15 is almost independent of all cosmological parameters except @xmath11 s and @xmath96 .    to emphasize this point",

    "[ skewq ] @xmath15 s for 3 different qcdm models , with different @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "they all agree to within a few percent . from eq .",
    "( [ s3cal ] ) and ( [ q3def ] ) , it is not hard to see that the normalization of @xmath48 gets divided out in the combination for @xmath15 .",
    "however , this really refers to the normalization of the nonlinear @xmath48 .",
    "the normalization of the linear @xmath48 , @xmath100 , should have some effect on @xmath15 through its impact on the shape of the nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "however , we find that at the small scales which dominate the relevant integrals for @xmath15 , the nonlinear power spectra for most models have rather similar shapes : a slope around @xmath101 or so .",
    "together with the fact that the nonlinear @xmath70 is a weak function of scale , this explains why the small angular - scale @xmath15 is relatively insensitive to both @xmath100 and @xmath99 . by the same reasoning",
    ", @xmath15 is quite independent of the spectral tilt as well .",
    "nonlinear clustering seems to erase memory of the initial conditions in @xmath15 , as far as cdm - type power spectra are concerned .",
    "we therefore have in hand a powerful statistical measure : the small - scale @xmath15 is almost purely determined by the cosmological energy contents .",
    "how do we understand the cosmological dependence of @xmath15 ?",
    "the best way is to go back to the definition of the projected mass density @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ kappadef ] ) .",
    "observe that @xmath102 occurs three times in the numerator of @xmath15 and four times in the denominator ( eq . [ [ s3cal ] ] ) .",

    "@xmath15 scales as @xmath104 , the reciprocal of the total matter content .",
    "this means flat matter dominated models generally have lower @xmath15 compared to low density models , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ skew_comp ] .",
    "moreover , a @xmath2 or quintessence dominated universe has a larger volume out to @xmath18 , compared to an open universe , making @xmath102 larger and @xmath15 smaller .",
    "finally , the different fluctuation growth rates in different cosmologies also shift the skewness to some extent .",
    "we find that the following crude approximation works surprisingly well in reproducing our results from integrating eq .",

    "( [ gdef ] ) or its generalization to include quintessence , @xmath107 is taken to be @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is @xmath110 i.e. the power spectrum is assumed to obey a power - law with simply linear evolution .",
    "the assumptions of a constant @xmath70 and a power - law @xmath48 implies a scale - independent @xmath15 . the results of applying eq .",
    "( [ s3approx ] ) are shown as open circles in fig .",
    "[ skew_comp]b .    for more accurate results ,",
    "we recommend going back to eq .",
    "( [ s3cal ] ) , ( [ q3 ] ) and ( [ k3approx ] ) , which give @xmath15 accurate to within @xmath77 at @xmath111 , assuming the sources are at @xmath18 .",
    "we have also suggested in  [ skewness ] a useful consistency check : @xmath85 , a measure that quantifies the degree of linearity , should be less than about @xmath79 . for models that are too linear , the hierarchical ansatz with a configuration independent @xmath70 ( eq . [ q3 ] ) breaks down .",
    "an interesting example is provided by the @xmath112cdm model simulated by jsw , which is exactly the same as scdm except that @xmath113 and hence has less power on small scales . as explained before , the highly nonlinear @xmath15 should be insensitive to @xmath99 , and our method would predict a @xmath112cdm @xmath15 very close to that of scdm .",
    "jsw found that that the @xmath112cdm n - body results are in fact about @xmath79 higher than the scdm results at a few arcminutes . applying our consistency test shows that @xmath85 is 2 - 3 times higher for @xmath112cdm compared to all other models we have considered .",
    "hence , the somewhat large difference between @xmath112cdm and scdm seen in jsw is a reflection of their different levels of nonlinearity .",
    "models with as little small - scale power as @xmath112cdm are probably inconsistent with observations of the lyman - alpha forest ( ) .",
    "we have argued that deep lensing surveys , with a total area of several square degrees and background galaxies at @xmath114 , should be capable of distinguishing between cosmological models with different energy contents . in particular ,",
    "contrary to what is indicated by perturbation theory , the small - scale skewness can be used to differentiate between curvature and cosmological constant dominated models .",
    "moreover , @xmath15 also shows sensitivity to the equation of state , @xmath96 , of quintessence models as well , making them distinguishable from @xmath2 models . in practice , however , since we have only one observable in @xmath15 , one needs to impose extra constraints to restrict the range of models when engaging in model testing . for example",
    ", one can assume the class of flat tracker - field models ( ) where @xmath96 is determined by @xmath26 , and so the only free parameter is @xmath26 .",
    "another example : making use of the fact that for a given @xmath0 curvature dominated models yield higher @xmath15 than @xmath2 models , one can obtain lower limits on @xmath0 .",
    "additional constraints from other observations such as the microwave background and large scale structure are obviously useful .",
    "it should also be borne in mind that systematic errors , such as those due to the correction of an anisotropic point - spread - function , have not been taken into account ( ) .",
    "in addition , we have assumed that the galaxy redshifts are known , but this is likely achievable by photometric techniques .",
    "a few issues are worth further investigation .",
    "a fitting formula for the three - point function , which smoothly interpolates between the perturbative and the highly nonlinear regimes , could in principle be used to extend our calculation to cover all angular scales . at present ,",
    "no such formula exist for cdm - type spectra ( ) .",
    "moreover , our method can be easily generalized to @xmath115 for arbitrary @xmath116",
    ". such a calculation would be useful for the estimation of measurement errors from lensing surveys ( ) .",
    "lastly , our expressions are easily generalizable to measures such as the aperture mass ( ) , which corresponds to using a different smoothing kernel @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ s3def ] ) , and its fourier transform @xmath117 in the rest of our expressions .",
