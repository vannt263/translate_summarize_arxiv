    "sub - velocity precision can now be achieved for m - dwarfs resulting from stabilized spectrographs ( such as harps , * ? ? ?",

    "this increased sensitivity enables the detection of planets of a few - earth masses orbiting in the star s habitable zone . recently , statistical population analyses of the nasa / kepler mission @xcite , and ground - based doppler surveys @xcite suggests that every low - mass star has at least one ( or more ) planet with an orbital period less than 50 days .",
    "very small planets in very short - period orbits have recently been discovered by the kepler mission ( e.g.  koi-1843 , * ? ? ?",
    "we recently started the cool tiny beats survey to charaterise the doppler variability over short time - scales and search for such small planets in short period orbits around nearby low - mass stars .",
    "the program uses the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher spectrograph ( harps ) installed at the 3.6 m eso telescope at la silla / chile and its northern counterpart at the telescopio nationale galileo / la palma .",

    "at only 3.91 pc , kapteyn s star ( or gj 191 , hd 33793 ) is the closest halo star to the sun @xcite .",
    "it is subluminous with respect to main sequence stars of the same spectral type and was spectroscopically classified as an m1.0 sub - dwarf by @xcite .",
    "a radius of 0.291@xmath00.025 r@xmath1 was directly measured by @xcite using interferometry .",
    "this combined with an estimate of its total luminosity was then used to derive an effective temperature of 3570@xmath0156 k and its mass was estimated to be 0.281@xmath00.014 m@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite determined a metallicity of @xmath2 $ ] = -0.86 which coincides with several later estimates within 0.05 dex .",
    "we independently obtained estimates of its metallicity and temperature by comparing its observed colors ( b , v , j , h , and k ) to synthetically generated ones from the phoenix library @xcite , obtaining compatible values of @xmath3}=-0.89 $ ] and @xmath4 k. only an upper limit has been measured for its projected rotation velocity ( @xmath5 , * ? ? ? * ) , and its x - ray luminosity has been measured to be comparable to other multi - planet host m - dwarfs such as gj  876 and gj  581 @xcite .",
    "therefore , planets of a few earth - masses orbiting such an inactive m - star should be detectable using doppler spectroscopy @xcite . a precise age estimation of the star can not be obtained from models , as they change very little for m  @xmath6  0.6  m@xmath1 in the range of ages between 0.4 and 15  gyr @xcite . the low metallicity and halo kinematics suggest an ancient origin , which is consistent with its low - activity and slow rotation .",
    "the observations comprise both new and archival data from harps , hires and pfs spectrometers .",
    "harps is a stabilized high - resolution spectrometer ( resolving power @xmath7 110 000 ) covering from 380 to 680 nm .",
    "the harps data we use come from two programs ; the cool tiny beats survey and archival data from the first harps - gto survey . the cool tiny beats data were obtained in two 12 night runs in may 2013 ( 11 spectra ) and in dec 2013 ( 55 spectra ) .",
    "the harps - gto data contain 30 spectra taken between 2003 and 2009 .",
    "@xcite reported some possible signals on kapteyn s star , but no detection claim could be made at the time .",
    "doppler measurements were obtained using the least - squares template - matching approach as implemented by the harps - terra software @xcite . for each spectrum",
    ", we also use two measurements of the symmetry of the mean - line profile as provided by the harps - data reduction software .",
    "these are the bisector span ( bis ) and the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the cross - correlation function .",
    "bis and fwhm are known to correlate with activity induced features that can cause spurious doppler signals .",
    "for example , changes in the line - symmetry caused by co - rotating dark and magnetic spots induce changes in the symmetry of the lines that produce spurious doppler shifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the variability in the ca ii h+k emission lines was also measured by harps - terra through the s - index .",
    "the variability in the s - index is also known to correlate with magnetic activity of the star @xcite , and localized active regions such as spots .",
    "any doppler signal with a period equivalent to variability detected in the bis , fwhm and s - index is likely to be spurious .",
    "we include 30 doppler measurements spanning between 1999 and 2008 using the hires spectrometer at keck @xcite .",
    "these measurements were obtained using the iodine cell technique as described in @xcite .",
    "a new hires stellar template was generated by deconvolving a high signal - to - noise iodine - free spectrum of the star applying maximum likelihood deconvolution with boosting @xcite .",
    "the star is never at an altitude greater than 26 deg from hawaii , which could explain the lower accuracy compared to the harps measurements .",
    "the long baseline of hires puts strong constraints on the long - period variability and mitigates alias ambiguities in the harps data .",
    "we also included 8 new doppler measurements obtained with pfs @xcite at magellan / las campanas observatory , also using the iodine cell technique . while the statistical contribution of pfs is small , the significance of the preferred solution increases thus providing further support to the signals .",
    "all spectroscopic measurements used are given in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "the initial signal detection is performed using log - likelihood periodograms @xcite and tempered markov chain samplings using the delayed - rejection adaptive - metropolis method ( or dram , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as implemented in @xcite .",
    "these methods produce maps of the maximum likelihood and posterior densities as a function of the period being investigated . as in classic periodograms",
    ", preferred periods will appear as peaks ( local probability maxima ) .",
    "the significance is then assessed using the bayesian criteria described in @xcite .",
    "we say that a doppler signal is detected if 1 ) its period is well - constrained , 2 ) its amplitude is statistically significantly different from zero , and 3 ) inclusion of the signal in the model increases the bayesian evidence by a factor of @xmath8 , which is more conservative than usual because important effects might be missing in the model , especially when combining data from different instruments .",
    "the model of the observations is fully encoded in the definition of the likelihood function .",
    "in addition to the usual keplerian parameters , our model includes three nuisance parameters for each instrument ( ins ) : a constant offset @xmath9 , an extra white - noise term @xmath10 and a moving average coefficient @xmath11 that quantifies the amount of correlation between consecutive measurements .",
    "@xmath12 is bound between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( anticorrelation ) and a value consistent with zero implies no significant correlation .",
    "our model also assumes an exponential decay of the correlation that depends on a characteristic time - scale @xmath15 . adding it as a free parameter led to overparameterization , so a fixed value of @xmath16 days was set by default .",
    "linear trends caused by the presence of planets with periods much longer than the time - baseline is parameterized as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is also a free parameter of the doppler model and @xmath19 is an arbitrary reference epoch ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) .",
    "the log - likelihood periodograms use the same likelihood model but do not include correlations terms .",
    "false alarm probability assessments using likelihood periodograms ( or fap , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are also computed to double - check the significance of each detection .",
    "the search for signals in the doppler time - series is summarized in figure [ fig : periodograms ] .",
    "two very significant periods are detected at 121 and 48.6 days .",
    "the bayesian evidence ratios are @xmath20 for the one - planet model against the no - planet model , and @xmath21 for the two - planet solution against the one - planet model .",
    "these numbers are well in excess of the 10@xmath22 threshold indicating very confident detections .",
    "the faps as derived from the log - likelihood periodograms are @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , which are also very small further supporting the detections ( acceptable detection thresholds using periodogram methods are typically between 1% and 0.1% ) .",
    "the support of the signals by the three data sets is illustrated in the phase - folded curves in figure  [ fig : phased ] .",
    "the uneven sampling can produce biases in the significance estimates . to investigate this",
    ", we also performed the same analysis using nightly averaged measurements .",
    "the same two signals are detected well above our significance thresholds , thus providing further confidence in the detections .",
    "as for other stars , further follow - up over the next few years is desirable to confirm that both low - amplitude signals remain coherent over time .",
    "we investigated linear correlations with activity indices by including them in the likelihood model of the harps data . while we could still easily detect the planetary signals , these models had lower probabilities due to over - parameterization and are not included in the final solution",
    ". we also verified whether if any indicator of activity showed variability in similar time - scales as the doppler data .",
    "while the bis does not show any hint of temporal coherence , the fwhm and s - index do share similar periodogram structures with tentative peaks between 140 to 2000 days .",
    "however , neither had faps that were lower than 5% , indicating little significance .",

    "a log - likelihood periodogram analysis identified two significant signals at 340 and 1100 days , both with amplitudes of @xmath7 5 mmag .",
    "the signal at 1100 days is compatible with other reports of periodicities in activity indices of m - dwarfs @xcite , and the 340-day variability might be caused by seasonal systematic errors , or by a long rotation period .",
    "the periodogram structure of the photometry resembles those of the fwhm and the s - index , further supporting potential low - level activity changes happening at timescales of several hundred days .",
    "given that the activity and doppler signals appear uncorrelated , we conclude that the simplest interpretation of the doppler data is the presence of two planets ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) . with a period of 48.6 days",
    ", kapteyn  b lies well within the liquid water habitable zone of the star @xcite . assuming rocky composition , its properties and possible climates should be similar to those discussed for gj  667ce @xcite .",
    "kapteyn  c receives @xmath7 10% of earth s irradiance , implying that the possibility of it being able to support liquid water on its surface is less probable .",
    "we used optimal bls @xcite to search for possible transit events in the asas photometry .",
    "no trasits were found when searching for a signal in the range of parameters compatible with the doppler solution .",
    "further observations at the predicted transit windows are needed to put meaningful constraints on possible transit signals .",
    "the age of kapteyn star can be inferred from its membership to the galactic halo and peculiar element abundances @xcite . the current hierarchical milky way formation scenario suggests that streams of halo stars were originated as tidal debris from satellite dwarf galaxies being engulfed by the early milky way ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by the age estimations of the stars in the inner halo ( @xmath71012 gyr , * ? ? ? * ) , and globular clusters .",
    "the work by eggen and collaborators ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* as review summary ) established the existence of such high - velocity , metal - poor moving groups in the solar neighborhood .",
    "kapteyn s star is the prototype member of one of these groups , which has been recently investigated by @xcite among others .",
    "stars in kapteyn s group share a retrograde velocity of rotation around the galactic centre of about @xmath69 k@xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observation of 16 members has shown that the group likely originated from the same progenitor structure as the peculiar globular cluster @xmath34 centauri , but not from within the cluster itself @xcite .",
    "the origin of kapteyn s star within a merging dwarf - galaxy sets its most likely age around the young halo s one ( @xmath70 gyr ) and should not be older than 13.7 gyrs , which is the current estimate of the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "numerical integration of several possible orbits over 10@xmath22yr to 1  myr using _ mercury 6 _ @xcite shows very small changes in the orbital parameters . despite the the periods for the two planet candidates are compatible with a 5:2 period commensurability ( see table [ tab : parameters ] ) , the analysis of the resonant angles for the best fit solution did not support the presence of dynamical mean - motion resonances , which existence also depend on a number of other properties such total planet masses and mutual inclinations .",
    "we found , however , that the difference in periastron angles @xmath71 librates around 180 deg ; which corresponds to a long - term stable configuration called apsidal locking .",
    "this is sufficient to show that the proposed system is compatible with long - term physically - viable solutions .",
    "it has been suggested that two - planet systems that underwent weak dissipation ( slow migration ) should always end - up in absidal locking @xcite , which has consequences on the likely planet - formation scenario .",
    "a more thorough analysis to properly quantify the significance of the absidal locking and possible mean - motion ressonances requires a much more extended discussion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the detection of two super - earths here is consistent with the idea that low - metallicity stars are more prone to the formation of low - mass planets rather than gas giants @xcite .",
    "this is further supported by a significant paucity of lowest - mass planets in doppler searches of metal - rich stars @xcite , and non - comfirmation of previous claims of gas giants around extremely metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "these observational findings are compatible with recent population synthesis experiments such as those in @xcite .",
    "once the planets signals are included in the doppler model , the rv residuals variability are reduced to instrumental noise ( i.e.  extra jitter term is compatible with reported stability of harps , and correlation coefficients compatible with 0 ) .",
    "this indicates that the star is very doppler stable , possibly more stable than the instruments themselves .",
    "this indeed would be expected because pulsation and convective motions are thought to be much smaller in inactive low - mass stars than in earlier types . at the likely age of the system",
    ", most g and k dwarfs are evolving away from the main sequence into giants , which makes the doppler detection of small planets unfeasible due to increased activity levels ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ? * ) . as a result",
    ", original architectures of the first planetary systems can only be explored by observing venerable low - mass stars which are still on the main - sequence such as kapteyn s star .",

    "<S> the activity indicies and archival asas-3 photometry show evidence for low - level activity periodicities of the order of several hundred days . however , there are no significant correlations with the radial velocity variations on the same time - scales . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of planetary keplerian signals in the model results in levels of correlated and excess white noise that are remarkably low compared to younger g , k and m dwarfs . we conclude that kapteyn s star is most probably orbited by two super - earth mass planets , one of which is orbiting in its circumstellar habitable zone , becoming the oldest potentially habitable planet known to date . </S>",
    "<S> the presence and long - term survival of a planetary system seems a remarkable feat given the peculiar origin and kinematic history of kapteyn s star . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of super - earth mass planets around halo stars provides important insights into planet - formation processes in the early days of the milky way .    </S>",
