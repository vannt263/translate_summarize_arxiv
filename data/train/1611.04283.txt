    "it was for a long time to recognize a remarkable radio - loud / radio - quiet ( rl / rq ) dichotomy for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "rl - agns prefer to be associated with high - mass supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , i.e. , @xmath3 ( e.g. , laor 2000 ) . while , a very wide range of @xmath4 can be found for rq - agns .",
    "the rl / rq dichotomy is , however , challenged by the identification of dozens of rl narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , komossa et al .",
    "the special observational properties of nls1s enable most of authors believe that they are the objects at early evolutionary phase associated with low - mass smbh and very high eddington ratio ( e.g. , mathur 2000 ; zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "bh s spin is widely believed to play a crucial role in determining the radio emission from smbhs .",
    "a scenario that an energy extraction from a smbh spun up by a bh - bh merger ( e.g. , chiaberge & marconi 2011 ) is favored for high - mass smbhs .",
    "this spin - up scenario is , however , almost infeasible for low - mass smbhs , because they are believed to largely build from secular evolution driven by internal dynamical processes in the disk growth rather than from a merge of two bhs ( e.g. , kormendy & ho 2013 ) .",
    "the origin of angular momentum of these low - mass smbhs is therefore still a puzzle at present . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to address the puzzle from a different perspective based on the properties of the host galaxy that can provide a clue of evolutionary information through stellar dynamics and population .",
    "this aim naturally requires us to focus on radio - selected type ii agns with small @xmath4 in stead of their type i counterparts , because the obscuration of the central bright nuclei by the dust torus allows the stellar population and morphology of the host galaxies to be easily measured from ground observations for the type ii agns . in a type",
    "i agn , its host galaxy is typically overwhelmed by the agn s continuum and broad lines in optical wavelengths .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the sample selection and image analysis are described in  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the statistical results along with the implications are shown in  4 . a @xmath5cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8",
    "is adopted throughout the paper .",
    "a sample of radio - selected nearby seyfert 2 galaxies with small @xmath4 is selected as follows .",
    "we start from the value - added sdss data release 7 max - planck institute for astrophysics / johns hopkins university ( mpa / jhu ) catalog ( see heckman & kauffmann 2006 for a review ) . at the beginning , we require the objects with a redshift smaller than 0.05 to ensure their host galaxies can be resolved by the sdss image observations . given the line fluxes reported in the catalog , we then extract `` pure '' seyfert 2 galaxies from the selected low - z objects by using a series of demarcation schemes ( kewley et al . 2001 , 2006 ) based on the widely used three baldwin - phillips - terlevich diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. , veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) . to further avoid the contamination by low - ionization nuclear emission regions ( liners ) , we require the [ ] / [ ] line ratio throughout the paper . ] is larger than 3 according to the scheme proposed by heckman et al .",
    ".    objects with small @xmath4 are then extracted from the selected `` pure '' seyfert 2 galaxies according to the well - documented @xmath4-@xmath9 relationship ( e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "the values of velocity dispersion @xmath9 of the star component are taken from the mpa / jhu catalog .",
    "the objects with measured @xmath9 between 80 and 120@xmath10 are retained in our subsequent sample selection .",
    "this range of @xmath9 corresponds to a @xmath4 of @xmath11 , based the recent calibration of @xmath12 presented in mcconnell & ma ( 2013 ) .",
    "the calibration is valid for a sample of @xmath4 of @xmath13 .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath14 is used in our sample selection because of the instrumental spectral resolution of sdss of @xmath15 .",
    "the selected `` pure '' seyfert 2 galaxies with small @xmath4 are subsequently cross - matched with the first survey catalog ( becker et al .",
    "the cross - match follows the methods described in richards et al ( 2002 ) , in which a matching radius of 2  is adopted for compact radio sources , and a radius of @xmath16 for possible extended sources , the radius of @xmath16 corresponds to a physical size of @xmath17 that is close to the size ( @xmath18 ) of typical jets and lobs .",
    "in fact , all the objects listed in our final sample have redshifts larger than 0.01 ( see table 1 ) . ] . with the first limiting flux density ( 5@xmath19 ) of 1mjy",
    ", our cross - match finally returns 54 radio - selected seyfert 2 galaxies with small @xmath4 .",
    "the radio power at 1.4 ghz ( rest frame ) of each of the 54 selected objects is calculated from the observed integrated flux density @xmath20 through the formula @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the luminosity distance , @xmath23 the redshift , and @xmath24 ( e.g. , ker et al . 2012 ) the spectral slope defined as @xmath25 . the derived @xmath26 has a range from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",

    "figure 1 shows an anti - correlation between the calculated @xmath29}}$ ] and @xmath33 for all the selected 54 objects .",
    "the anti - correlation motivates us to exclude the objects at the right - bottom ( left - top ) corner for the current study , because the most large ( small ) @xmath33 of these objects are simply caused by their extremely low ( high ) accretion activities rather than powerful ( weak ) radio emission . with these considerations , we finally focus on the objects located within a bin of @xmath36}}=40.6 - 41.2 $ ] .",
    "the bin size is chosen by a compromise between the scatter of the @xmath29}}$ ] versus @xmath33 correlation and the size of our finally used sample .    in summary",
    ", we finally selected 31 radio - selected nearby ( @xmath0 ) seyfert 2 galaxies with small @xmath4 of @xmath11 , after removing the duplications .",
    "the properties of these objects are listed in table 1 , except for sdssj160151.51 + 024809.9 ( see section 3 for the details ) .",
    "at first , the sextractor package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) is performed for each of the sdss - corrected @xmath2-band frames to determine the detection threshold , and to define the area where the galaxy signal is above the determined threshold .",
    "a threshold of 1.5 times of the background noise is adopted in our data reduction . a stamp image centered on the object",
    "is therefore produced by the sextractor package . with the stamp images ,",
    "we perform a 2-dimensional bulge+disk decomposition by the publicly available gim2d package ( simard et al .",
    "2002 ) that is demonstrated to be valid for different galaxy samples ( e.g. , de jong et al .",
    "2004 ) , except for sdssj160151.51 + 024809.9 .",
    "the image shows that the host of the object is a heavily obscured edge - on disk galaxy . the surface brightness profile used in our decomposition",
    "is described by a combination of an exponential radial profile for the disk component and a sersic profile with an index of @xmath37 for the bulge component . a simple point spread function ( psf ) with a gaussian profile is adopted in the convolution of our modeling to account for the seeing effect .",
    "the resulted reduced @xmath38 is very close to unit for all the 30 host galaxies .",
    "table 1 tabulates some modeled parameters of the 30 host galaxies .",
    "the parameters are b / t ratio , the ratio of the disk scale length over the bulge effective radius @xmath39 and the sersic index @xmath37 .",
    "the reported uncertainties given by the gim2d package at a confidence level of 99% are based on the topology of the parameter space being built up in the fitting .",
    "two objects ( sdssj154559.09 + 270629.5 and sdssj162622.65 + 210542.8 ) are excluded from subsequent statistical analysis because their modeled bulge effective radius @xmath40 are extremely smaller than the size of the corresponding psf .",

    "the left panel shows a newly identified anti - correlation between @xmath33 and @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , the galaxies with @xmath42 generally tend to have a classical bulge with @xmath43 , while the ones with @xmath44 a pesudo - bulge with @xmath45 ( e.g. , kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; fisher & drory 2008 ) .",
    "a spearman rank - order statistical test yields a correlation coefficient of @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding probability of null correlation from two - tailed is calculated to be @xmath47 , which corresponds to a significant level at 2.81@xmath19 . as an additional test",
    ", a generalized kendall s @xmath48 correlation coefficient is calculated to be @xmath49 at a significance level of @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding probability of null correlation is inferred to be @xmath51 .",
    "a comparison of the plots in the middle and right panels clearly shows that it is the radio power , rather than the agn s accretion activity , depending on the modeled @xmath52 .",
    "figure 6 plots @xmath33 against various properties of host galaxy . at first",
    ", one can see from the plot that there is an independence of @xmath33 on the stellar population age as assessed by the parameter @xmath53 , although almost all the host galaxies are associated with relatively young stellar populations , i.e. , @xmath54 ( e.g. , heckman & best 2014 ) .",
    "another independence can be identified for @xmath33 on the measured bulge fraction b / t , which implies that the radio emission from the low - mass smbhs is not related with the morphology type of the host galaxies .",
    "we identify a moderate relation between @xmath33 and @xmath39 .",
    "objects with stronger radio emission tends to have larger bulge size .",
    "our statistical analysis returns a correlation coefficient of @xmath55 at a significance level of @xmath56 by adopting the spearman rank - order statistics .",
    "the corresponding probability of null correlation is determined to be @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , a correlation coefficient based on the kendall s @xmath48 method is obtained to be @xmath58 at a significance level of @xmath59 , which corresponds to a probability of null correlation of @xmath60 .",
    "one would argue that the powerful radio emission in the sample is emitted from starforming regions in the host galaxies rather than from the agns ( e.g. , kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "we estimate an upper limit of star formation rate ( sfr ) for each object through the calibration of @xmath61}}/10^{42 } \\mathrm{erg\\ s^{-1}}}{16.73 - 1.75[\\log(\\mathrm{o / h})+12 ] } m_\\odot\\ \\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ ] in kewley et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , by assuming the [ oii]@xmath62 line emission is fully contributed by the ongoing star formation .",
    "@xmath63 is the metallicity twice of the solar value that is usually used in agns ( e.g. , ho 2005 ) . with the estimated sfr , an upper limit of the radio power contributed by an underlying star formation @xmath64",
    "is then inferred for each object by a combination of the relationship of @xmath65 in condon ( 1992 ) and a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "the bottom - left panel in figure 6 shows the distribution of @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the observed radio power .",
    "the distribution indicates that the values of @xmath64 are typically lower than the observed ones by 1 - 2 orders of magnitudes , with the worst case of @xmath68 .",
    "previous studies have reported two possible problems with the @xmath4 estimated from the @xmath69 correlation for pesudo - bulges .",
    "the relationship of pesudo - bulge is either very weak ( e.g. , kormendy et al .",
    "2011 ) or shifted from that of classical bulge in both slope and intercept ( e.g. , hu 2008 ; mcconnell & ma 2013 ; ho & kim 2014 ) .",
    "these two problems have no essential effect on our results . at first , the values of @xmath4 listed in table 1 are only representative in sample description and not directly involved in the revealed @xmath70 anti - correlation .",
    "secondly , compared to the relationship of pesudo - bulges , the @xmath4 estimated from the global relationship tends to be systematically over - estimated , rather than under - estimated , which in fact reinforces our sample selection of objects with small @xmath4 .",
    "both orientation and intrinsic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the powerful radio emission in agns with small @xmath4 .",
    "the orientation mechanism attributes the observed powerful radio emission to either a significant underestimation of @xmath4 due to a disk broad - line region ( blr ) almost face - on ( e.g. , baldi et al .",
    "2016 ) or a boost in radio flux due to the beaming effect of a relativistic jet ( e.g. , yuan et al . 2008 ; liu et al .",
    "2016 and references therein ) . in the intrinsic mechanism",
    ", the powerful radio emission can be ascribed to an energy extraction from either a disk wind ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 ; wang et al .",
    "2003 ; cao 2016 ) or bh spin ( e.g. , blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "the identified correlation between radio power and host bulge profile at first allows us to exclude the orientation scenarios for the current sample , simply because the bulge profile is not related with the orientation of either a disk blr or a relativistic jet .",
    "in addition , our sample is selected on @xmath4 estimated from the @xmath69 relation , which allows us to completely avoid the underestimation issue mentioned above .",
    "we subsequently argue that the disk wind scenario is not applicable in the current sample , because our sample is selected on nuclear properties ( i.e. , accretion rate and @xmath4 ) .",
    "in fact , a direct statistical analysis does not reveal any relation between @xmath33 and eddington ratio @xmath71 assessed by @xmath72}}/\\sigma_{\\star}^4 $ ] that is usually used in type ii agns ( e.g. , heckman & best 2014 ) .    with the exclusion of the three possible scenarios",
    ", we finally argue that the @xmath73 anti - correlation favors the scenario in which a low - mass smbh is spun up by the gas accreted with significant disk - like rotational dynamics .",
    "an extraction of rotational energy of a bh plays an important role in launching powerful jets .",
    "the dependence of jet power on bh spin has been frequently suggested by various models ( e.g. , ghosh & abramowicz 1997 ; wang et al .",
    "2003 ) , although the details depends on the adopted accretion disk model and the parametrization of the poloidal magnetic filed .",
    "both bh - bh merger and disk accretion can efficiently shape the final bh spin ( e.g. , hughes & blandford 2003 ; volonteri et al .",
    "the revealed independence of @xmath33 on b / t ratio at first allows us to exclude the merger scenario for spinning - up the low - mass smbhs .    a host rotational dynamics - related bh spinning - up",
    "is then suggested by the revealed @xmath70 correlation . a clear bulgeless disk with @xmath74 is recently discovered in 2masxj23453268 - 0449256 , an unique rl massive spiral galaxy with a powerful jet of a scale of @xmath751.6 mpc ( bagchi et al .",
    "in fact , bh spin is suggested to relate with host dynamics by a recent theoretical study , in which a bh fueling flow attached to the dynamics of host galaxy at large scale is required to match the observed bh spin distribution well ( sesana et al . 2014 ) .",
    "observations indicate that the dynamics in pesudo - bulges is more dominated by rotation than in classical bulges ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "a low - mass smbh can be efficiently spun up by the bardeen - peterson effect ( bardeen & peterson 1975 ) that realign the bh - disk system through the interaction between the frame - dragging effect of the lense - thirring torque and the strong disk viscous strees ( e.g. , king et al 2005 ; perego et al 2009 ; li et al 2015 ) , if the gas accreted onto the smbh has not only significant disk - like rotational dynamics , but also a mass exceeding the alignment mass limit of accretion event .",
    "the alignment mass limit is roughly @xmath76 ( sikora et al . 2007 ) , where @xmath77 is the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath78 , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the schwarzschild radius and distance of wrap of the accretion disk , respectively . with the eq .",
    "( 22 ) in king et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for @xmath81 , the limit mass is reduced to @xmath82 , which implies that , with respect to a high - mass one , a low - mass smbh can be more readily spun up by a smaller mass increment .",
    "our results show that low - mass and high - mass smbhs are spun up by two entirely different mechanisms that are believed to relate with two evolutionary paths .",
    "a pesudo - bulge that is favored by a spinning - up of low - mass smbhs can be resulted from the secular evolution of disk galaxies ( e.g , silverman et al .",
    "2011 ; kormendy & ho 2013 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; fisher & drory 2011 ) , in which the pesudo - bulge might be related with either a second hump instability or a vertical dynamical resonance ( e.g. , sellwood 2014 ) .",
    "meanwhile , a classical bulge favored for high - mass smbhs is widely believed to be created through a `` dry '' merger of two galaxies ( toomre 1977),although this scenario is challenged by a recent identification of a rl and bulgeless spiral galaxy with a @xmath83 ( bagchi et al .",
    "we study the origin of spin of small smbh on a sample of radio - selected nearby ( @xmath0 ) seyfert 2 galaxies with a @xmath4 of @xmath1 , which allows us to identify a new dependence of radio power on host bulge surface brightness .",
    "the dependence favors a scenario that a low - mass smbh is spun up by the gas accreted with significant disk - like rotational dynamics .",
