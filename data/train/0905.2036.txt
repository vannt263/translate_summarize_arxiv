    "although the emphasis of experimental investigations has been primarily on the problem of resonance superfluidity , interacting fermi gases support other strongly - correlated phases including itinerant ferromagnetism .    in solid state condensed matter systems ,",
    "the problem of itinerant ferromagnetism has a long history dating back to the pioneering studies by stoner @xcite and wohlfarth @xcite .",
    "these early investigations proposed that , at low enough temperatures , a fermi gas subject to a repulsive interaction potential could undergo a continuous phase transition into an itinerant spin polarized phase  @xcite .",
    "this stoner transition reflects the shifting balance between the potential energy gained in spin polarization through pauli exclusion statistics , and the associated cost in kinetic energy .",
    "subsequent studies showed that fluctuations in the magnetization at low temperatures drive the second order transition first order at low enough temperatures  @xcite .",
    "such behavior is born out around quantum criticality in a variety of experimental solid state systems including @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath1  @xcite , mnsi  @xcite , @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath3  @xcite , and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "when subject to a magnetic field , the attendant increase in zeeman energy results in the bifurcation of the tricritical point separating the region of first and second order ferromagnetic transitions into two lines of metamagnetic critical points .    in the following",
    ", we will explore the potential implications of this itinerant magnetic phase behavior on the equilibrium properties of strongly interacting two - component atomic fermi gases ; here we refer to the pseudo - spin associated with the hyperfine states characterizing the two atomic populations .",
    "however , in contrast to the solid state system , the application of these ideas to the atomic fermi gas must address the features imposed by the trap geometry , and the constraints resulting from the inability of particles to transfer between different spin states  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "in the general case , one must consider atomic fermi mixtures in which an effective spin polarization is imposed by population imbalance  @xcite .",
    "the potential for itinerant ferromagnetism in atomic fermi gases has been already addressed in the literature , @xcite showed that an optical lattice would reduce the repulsive interaction strength required to realize ferromagnetism , and @xcite studied a trapped system in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "subsequently , @xcite developed a diagrammatic perturbative expansion in interaction strength to address the phase behavior of the balanced two - component fermi system . in the following",

    "here we have used a pseudo - spin index , @xmath11 , to discriminate the two components . as independent particles ( with no interconversion ) ,",
    "the density of the two majority / minority degrees of freedom must be specified by two chemical potentials . for convenience ,",

    "time of flight measurements of the expanding cloud with no external magnetic field @xmath150 are ballistic and so can provide the initial kinetic energy . if the magnetic field is present , @xmath151 , then interactions are significant during the expansion .",
    "collisions ensure that all of the interaction energy is converted into kinetic energy so the measurements reflect the total released energy . taking the difference between the @xmath151 and @xmath150 measurements",
    "therefore probes the interaction energy .",
    "an unmagnetized gas has interaction energy whereas the fully magnetized gas has zero interaction energy so time of flight measurements should allow the ferromagnetic state to be detected .",
    "radio frequency spectroscopy @xcite allows one to probe the spatial variations of scattering lengths by exciting the atoms from one spin state @xmath152 into some other state @xmath153 whilst leaving the atoms in the second spin state @xmath154 unaffected .",
    "the presence of atoms in state @xmath154 shifts the resonance @xmath155 by @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the scattering length between states @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "measurement of the resonance shift could allow the spatial distribution of the individual species to be probed .",
    "the presence of the ferromagnetic state could be inferred by looking for the characteristic density profiles outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : trappingpotentialuniformsystem ] .    a third simple method of detecting a ferromagnetic transition could be to monitor the size of the atomic cloud . in a harmonic trap",
    "the cloud size is proportional to the square root of the fermi energy .",
    "therefore , the size of the fully - magnetized state is @xmath160 larger than the unmagnetized .    on",
    "the repulsive side of the feshbach resonance three - body collisions can result in the formation of a molecular bound state of two atoms that might destroy the atomic gas before it has time to undergo ferromagnetic ordering . to overcome this obstacle an atomic gas spin",
    "could be polarized along the magnetic field direction and an rf @xmath161 pulse applied to rotate all the spins into the plane @xcite .",
    "the rate of precession of the spins is set by the magnetic field strength , which varies across the atomic gas due to field inhomogeneities .",
    "the precession rate of the atoms would however be kept locked together by the ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "furthermore the ferromagnetic phase has an antisymmetric wave function which inhibits collisions and so prevents the formation of molecular bound states .",
    "a signature of ferromagnetism is therefore the absence of molecular bound state formation .",
    "we now outline two possible ways to further our analysis .",
    "the first order phase transition leads to discontinuities in the density and magnetization leading to phase separation .",
    "such behavior could lead to a breakdown of the local density approximation , a potential source of inaccuracy in our analysis .",
    "this could be fixed through inclusion of a surface energy .",
    "the second is to investigate the possibility that magnetic texture could develop .",
    "textured modes may have been seen via the possible formation of a cdw / sdw in experimental results on the analogous solid state systems of itinerant electron ferromagnets @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath162 @xcite , and mnsi @xcite .",
    "our general formalism should be able to be extended to include the possibility of a textured phase which lies beyond the first order line in the putative paramagnetic regime .",
    "in conclusion we have developed a general formalism to describe itinerant ferromagnetic transitions in two - component fermionic cold atom systems with repulsive interactions , and potential population imbalance . at low population imbalance , we predict that the first order transition that characterizes the balanced system persists . however , when the imbalance is large the transition becomes continuous . in the trap geometry we found the first order phase transition led to discontinuities in density and magnetization .",
    "up to a critical total population imbalance , set by the possible total magnetization following a first order transition , the phases in the trap had the same density and magnetization profiles with increasing population imbalance , but in - plane magnetization fell .",
    "with population imbalance above this level , the system requires a chemical potential shift to generate a population imbalance ; however there is still a small range over which a first order phase transition is seen . in the two latter cases the local population imbalance displayed a characteristic minimum with radius .",
    "the authors acknowledge the financial support of the epsrc , and thank wolfgang ketterle and zoran hadzibabic for useful discussions .",
    "an important integral eq .   encountered in this paper has the form @xmath163 to evaluate this integral one could substitute @xmath164 , and then integrate over three parameters representing the lengths of vectors @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , and a minimum of three relative angles between these vectors , giving a total of six integration parameters .",
    "however , numerical integration generally becomes more prohibitive with increasing number of dimensions .",
