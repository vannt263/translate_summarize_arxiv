    "visual odometry is an important area of information fusion in which the central aim is to estimate the pose of a robot using data collected by visual sensors @xcite . because nearly all robotic tasks require knowledge of the pose of the robot , visual odometry plays a critical role in robot control , simultaneous localization and mapping ( slam ) and robot navigation , especially when external reference information about the environment ( such as gps data ) is unavailable .",
    "visual odometry can be viewed as a particular instance of the general pose tracking problem , which is the most fundamental perception problem in robotics @xcite .    to date",
    ", a variety of different visual odometry methods based on different sensor information have been studied and widely implemented .",
    "one of the most well - known methods is the iterative closest point ( icp ) algorithm @xcite , which estimates the robot s pose by minimizing the distance between corresponding points in two laser scanning snapshots .",
    "however , this method can easily become trapped in local optima if a good initial guess is not provided .",
    "in addition to the icp algorithm and its variants , odometry methods using camera images have also been studied @xcite @xcite .",
    "such methods usually extract point features from the camera images and match them through a series of steps , including descriptor matching , ransac and bundle adjustment . due to their expensive computational burden , these approaches are usually too slow for real - time application .",
    "one way of improving computational efficiency is to use sparse point features , but this approach does not fully exploit the available image data , ignoring much relevant information .    recently , with rgb - d cameras becoming smaller and cheaper , the opportunity has arisen to develop rgb - d odometry methods that exploit both intensity and depth information .",
    "one such method was proposed by the computer vision group at the technical university of munich ( tum ) . in this method ,",
    "a single - objective optimization problem is formulated to penalize the intensity difference between corresponding pixels in consecutive images @xcite @xcite .",
    "this method can be implemented in real - time even on a single - core cpu .",
    "however , the image depth information is only used to determine the relationship between corresponding pixels in consecutive images for intensity residual comparison ; depth residuals are not considered .",
    "thus , a new bi - objective optimization problem was subsequently proposed in @xcite to minimize both depth and intensity residuals , with the aim of improving estimation performance .    in this paper , we consider the same bi - objective optimization formulation as in @xcite .",
    "our aims are twofold : ( i ) to propose new computational approaches for solving this bi - objective optimization formulation ; and ( ii ) to explore and quantify the advantages of the bi - objective optimization formulation for improving estimation robustness .",
    "the first computational approach we investigate , the so - called weighted sum method , involves integrating the two objective functions into a single objective using a weighting factor .",
    "we derive a new formula for adaptive calculation of this weighting factor , which is crucial to estimation accuracy .",
    "our formula is based on a novel _ image complexity _ metric and differs from the corresponding formula in @xcite , which uses the ratio of median intensity and median depth values to calculate the weighting factor .",
    "the second computational approach we investigate , the so - called bounded objective method , involves optimizing one of the objective functions while the other objective function is bounded via a constraint .",
    "again , our new _ image complexity _",
    "metric is used , this time to determine an appropriate objective bound . to evaluate performance ,",
    "the open source tum rgb - d dataset @xcite was used .",
    "the computational results demonstrate that our new methods generally give results of superior accuracy compared with the methods in @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the camera motion in 3-d space has six degrees of freedom and can be denoted as @xmath0^{\\top},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the translation components of the motion and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the rotation components of the motion . to estimate @xmath7 , we consider a world point @xmath8 and assume that its brightness is the same in two consecutive images .",
    "this is the so - called photo - consistency assumption @xcite , which can be expressed mathematically by @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the mapping coordinate of the world point @xmath8 in the first image and @xmath11 represents the corresponding coordinate of @xmath8 in the second image when given the true value of the camera motion @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the brightness ( or intensity ) values of the specified coordinates in the first and second images , respectively .    based on the photo - consistency assumption",
    ", we can define the intensity difference corresponding to the motion estimate @xmath7 as @xmath15 according to the results in @xcite , the more accurate the camera motion estimate , the smaller the residual @xmath16 .",
    "thus , estimation quality in visual odometry can be assessed by considering the following least - squares objective function , which is the sum of residual squares for @xmath17 world points : @xmath18 then the problem of determining the camera motion can be formulated as a least - squares optimization problem , i.e. , @xmath19 to improve robustness , weighted residuals can be used to reduce the effect of noise and outliers in the image data .",
    "this motivates the following weighted objective function in quadratic form : @xmath20^{\\top}\\bm{\\omega}_{i}\\left [ \\bm{r}_{i}(\\bm{\\xi } ) \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a diagonal weight matrix and @xmath22^{\\top}.\\ ] ]",
    "[ fig:1 ]     traditional cameras only provide image intensity information .",
    "rgb - d cameras , on the other hand , provide image intensity and image depth information , both of which can be used for visual odometry .",
    "for example , in the odometry methods introduced by the tum computer vision group @xcite @xcite , the relationship between corresponding pixels in consecutive images is expressed in terms of the depth information in the first image , and the intensity information of both images is used to define the motion estimation residuals as in section [ single - objective optimization ] . more precisely , the relationship between corresponding pixels in consecutive images is defined by a warping function as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the depth value of the pixel in the first image and @xmath25 is the warping function for calculating the mapping coordinate @xmath26 in the second image . for the specific form of the warping function @xmath25 , we refer the reader to @xcite .    although single - objective optimization - based odometry methods are computationally fast and effective , they can produce poor results in some situations .",
    "for example , when textural features in the image sequence are poor , trajectory estimation accuracy will decrease dramatically .",
    "this is because the objective function @xmath27 only depends on image intensity information , and thus it can become non - convex when image textural features are lacking . in this case , the `` optimal '' motion estimates obtained by applying an optimization iterative procedure may only be locally optimal . to investigate this hypothesis",
    ", we applied the single - objective optimization approach ( implemented using the gauss - newton method ) to image sequences in the tum rgb - d dataset @xcite .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "1 . from the results",
    ", we see that the translation error of the motion estimates increases significantly when textural features are lacking .",
    "this motivates the new bi - objective optimization formulation proposed in @xcite , in which both image intensity and image depth residuals are minimized to improve robustness .",
    "the extension of rgb - d odometry using bi - objective optimization is inspired by the icp algorithm and its variants , which estimate the sensor motion by minimizing residual coordinate differences , instead of image intensity values .",
    "since rgb - d cameras can provide both intensity and depth information simultaneously , we want to take full advantage of this feature by comparing depth differences , just as the icp algorithm compares coordinate differences .",
    "thus , we now consider two residuals instead of one : @xmath28_{z } ,      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the depth values of the specified coordinates in the first and second images , and @xmath31 projects the 3-d coordinate of world point @xmath8 from the first camera coordinate system to the second camera coordinate system based on the homogeneous transformation matrix for @xmath7 .",
    "operator `` @xmath32_{z}$ ] '' selects the coordinate value along the @xmath33-direction .",
    "see the diagram in fig . 2 for an explanation of the notation .",
    "[ fig:2 ]   is the world point under consideration , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the pixels corresponding to @xmath8 , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the depth values corresponding to @xmath8.,title=\"fig : \" ]    based on @xmath38 defined in , we consider the following objective function : @xmath39^{\\top}\\bm{\\omega}_{d}\\left [ \\bm{r}_{d}(\\bm{\\xi } ) \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a diagonal weight matrix and @xmath41^{\\top}.\\ ] ] combining objectives and , we consider the following bi - objective optimization problem : @xmath42^{\\top}.\\ ] ]      the weighted sum method is the most common approach to solving multi - objective optimization problems . in this method ,",
    "the individual objective functions are assigned different weights and then added together to form a single objective function . more specifically , for individual objective functions @xmath43 and decision vector @xmath44 , the combined objective function is @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the weights .",
    "if all of the weights are positive , then the minimum of is pareto optimal for the original multi - objective problem @xcite .    in essence",
    ", the objective weights provide additional degrees of freedom in the optimization problem . for our odometry problem ,",
    "the new single - objective optimization problem is defined as @xmath47 notice that by dividing @xmath48 by @xmath49 , we can obtain an equivalent optimization problem as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we only need to consider a single weighting factor @xmath52 .",
    "problem can be solved using the gauss - newton method . to do this , we linearize the residuals @xmath53 and @xmath54 using the taylor expansion proposed in @xcite : @xmath55 where `` @xmath56 '' denotes the addition operator in lie group se(3 ) ( for more details , see @xcite ) ; and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the jacobians defined by @xmath59 then the objective function in can be approximated by a quadratic function of @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62^{\\top}\\bm{\\omega}_{j}\\bm{r}_{j}(\\bm{\\xi})$ ] , @xmath63^{\\top}\\bm{\\omega}_{j}\\bm{r}_{j}(\\bm{\\xi})$ ] and @xmath64^{\\top}\\bm{\\omega}_{j}\\bm{j}_{j}(\\bm{\\xi})$ ] ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "suppose that at iteration @xmath66 , we have the motion estimate @xmath67 . then the increment @xmath68 should be chosen to minimize @xmath69 . according to the gauss - newton method , by differentiating for @xmath70 , the optimal value of @xmath68 satisfies the linear system @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes @xmath73 with @xmath70 and @xmath74 denotes @xmath75 with @xmath70 . to solve this linear system , methods such as cholesky decomposition can be used . after solving ,",
    "the updated motion estimate is given by @xmath76 .",
    "this iterative process continues until convergence is achieved .",
    "the effectiveness of the weighted sum method depends crucially on the weighting factor @xmath52 , which must be selected a priori and reflects the preference of the decision maker . a good choice for @xmath52 can result in more accurate trajectory estimates when compared to single - objective odometry methods , but a poor choice for @xmath52 may lead to unacceptable results .",
    "systematic approaches to selecting the weights in multi - objective optimization problems have been developed ( see , for example , @xcite ) , but few of them have been investigated in the context of visual odometry .",
    "tykkala et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a method that determines @xmath52 based on the ratio of median intensity and median depth values : @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the list of intensity values and @xmath79 denotes the list of depth values .    to explore the importance of the weight @xmath52 , we conducted two computational experiments with the tum rgb - d dataset . for our first experiment",
    ", we formed two image sequences : one containing images with poor textural features and one containing images with rich textural features . the structural features in both image sequences were rich .",
    "we observed that for the first sequence with poor textural features , the error decreases as @xmath52 is increased , but for the second sequence with rich textural features , the opposite occurs ( see fig .",
    "we believe that this is because the intensity objective function @xmath80 tends to be non - convex when images lack textural features . in this case , large values of @xmath52 magnify the relative importance of the depth objective function @xmath81 , thus potentially preventing the overall objective function in from becoming non - convex .    for our second experiment",
    ", we again formed two image sequences : this time the first image sequence contained images with poor structural features and poor textural features , and the second image sequence contained images with rich structural features and poor textural features .",
    "as expected , the error decreases as @xmath52 increases for the image sequence with rich structural features ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) . this is because @xmath81 is likely to be convex when images contain rich structural information , and a large @xmath52 will increase @xmath81 s relative influence in the overall objective function .",
    "based on the experimental results in fig .",
    "3 , we believe that the key to finding an optimal @xmath52 is to design a metric to measure textural and structural information . to do this , we consider the concept of _ image complexity _ , which is a measure of the inherent difficulty of finding a true target in a given image @xcite . peters et al .",
    "@xcite has summarized many image complexity metrics for automatic target recognizers .",
    "unfortunately , image complexity is a task - dependent notion and there is no universal metric applicable to all situations . after testing several of the metrics in @xcite",
    ", we designed our own metric for intensity complexity defined as follows : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the number of pixel rows and pixel columns , respectively , and @xmath85 denotes the intensity value at the specified pixel . for depth complexity",
    ", we use the analogue of for the depth values : @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the depth value at the specified pixel . to standardize the intensity data @xmath78 and the depth data @xmath79 , we define the following scaling factor as the ratio of the variance between them",
    ": @xmath88 combining - , we calculate the value of weight @xmath52 as follows : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is as defined in and @xmath91 is an adjustable constant .",
    "notice that large values of @xmath92 indicate rich textural features , and large values of @xmath93 indicate rich structural features .",
    "thus , we have deliberately chosen the value of @xmath52 in to be inversely proportional to @xmath92 , and proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "the idea is to use large values of @xmath52 when the image sequence is rich in structure and/or poor in texture , and small values of @xmath52 when the image sequence is poor in structure and/or rich in texture .",
    "the bounded objective method is another method for solving multi - objective optimization problems @xcite . in this method ,",
    "we minimize one of the objective functions ( considered as the most important , or primary , objective ) , while the other objective functions are bounded using additional constraints .",
    "for our odometry problem , we select @xmath27 as the primary objective function .",
    "the bi - objective optimization problem in then becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an upper bound for the least - squares sum of depth residuals . to solve the optimization problem in",
    ", we can again use the first - order taylor expansions of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the optimal increment @xmath60 at point @xmath7 is then given by the solution of the following problem : @xmath98 where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are as defined in .",
    "problem is a _ quadratically constrained quadratic program _ ( qcqp ) .",
    "the general form for a qcqp is @xmath105 qcqps are of both theoretical and practical significance @xcite .",
    "because the matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 are positive semidefinite , problem is a convex qcqp . to solve this convex qcqp ,",
    "we first transform it into a _ second - order cone programming _ ( socp ) problem and then apply socp techniques @xcite .",
    "the general form for a socp problem is @xmath108 the norm appearing in the constraints is the standard euclidean norm , i.e. , @xmath109 .",

    "we can use ecos , an socp solver developed by domahidi et al .",
    "ecos implements an interior point method to solve socps in the following standard form @xcite : @xmath113 where @xmath44 is a vector of optimization variables , @xmath114 is a vector of slack variables and @xmath115 is the cone @xmath116 to reformulate into the standard form required by ecos , we set @xmath117,\\ ] ] and set @xmath118,~ \\bm{h}=\\left [      \\begin{array}{lcr }      0",

    "however , compared to @xmath52 , the upper bound @xmath95 has a more explicit mathematical meaning and is easier to select a priori .",
    "in fact , since the value of @xmath121 can be measured directly when the true value of the camera motion @xmath12 is plugged into @xmath121 , it can be used to estimate the range of @xmath95 and find a good @xmath95 for optimization . in our algorithm , we choose the value of @xmath95 according to the complexity of depth image as follow : @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 is an adjustable threshold and @xmath93 is the depth metric in .",
