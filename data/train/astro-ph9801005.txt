    "the evolution with redshift of the rate of supernovae ( sne ) contains unique information on the star formation history of the universe , the initial mass function ( imf ) of stars , and the nature of the binary companion in type ia events .",
    "all are essential ingredients for understanding galaxy formation , cosmic chemical evolution , and the mechanisms which determined the efficiency of the conversion of gas into stars in galaxies at various epochs ( madau 1996 ; madau 1997a ; a. renzini , this volume ) .",
    "while the frequency of `` core - collapse supernovae '' , sn  ii and possibly sn  ib / c , which have short - lived progenitors , is essentially related , for a given imf , to the instantaneous stellar birthrate of massive stars , type ia sne  which are believed to result from the thermonuclear disruption of c - o white dwarfs in binary systems  follow a slower evolutionary clock , and can then be used as a probe of the past history of star formation in galaxies ( ruiz - lapuente 1997 ; yungelson & livio 1997 ) .    the tremendous progress in our understanding of faint galaxy data made possible by the combination of _ hst _ deep imaging ( williams 1996 ) and ground - based spectroscopy ( lilly 1996 ; ellis 1996 ; cowie 1996 ; steidel 1996 ) , together with the recent detection of type ia sne at cosmological distances ( garnavich 1997 ; perlmutter 1997 ) , allow for the first time a detailed comparison between the sn rates self - consistently predicted by stellar evolution models that reproduce the optical spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies and the observed values ( madau 1997b ) . in this talk",
    "i will show how accurate measurements of the frequencies of type ii(+ib / c ) and ia sne at low and intermediate redshifts could be used as an independent test for the star formation and heavy element enrichment history of the universe , and significantly improve our understanding of the intrinsic nature and age of the populations involved in the sn explosions . at @xmath2 , the biggest uncertainty in our estimates of the star formation density",
    "is probably associated with dust extinction .",
    "a determination of the amount of star formation at early epochs is of crucial importance , as the two competing scenarios for galaxy formation , `` monolithic collapse ''  where spheroidal systems formed early and rapidly , experiencing a bright starburst phase at high-@xmath3 ( eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 )  and `` hierarchical clustering ''  where ellipticals form continuosly by the merger of disk / bulge systems ( white & frenk 1991 ) and most galaxies never experience star formation rates in excess of a few solar masses per year ( baugh 1997 )  make very different predictions in this regard .",
    "i will show how , by detecting type ii sne at high-@xmath3 , the _ next generation space telescope _ should provide a unique test for distinguishing between different scenarios of galaxy formation .",
    "i will model the emission history of field galaxies at ultraviolet , optical , and near - infrared wavelengths by tracing the evolution with cosmic time of their luminosity density , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the best - fit schechter luminosity function in each redshift bin .",
    "the integrated light radiated per unit volume from the entire galaxy population is an average over cosmic time of the stochastic , possibly short - lived star formation episodes of individual galaxies , and follows a relatively simple dependence on redshift .",
    "madau ( 1997a ) have shown how a stellar evolution model , defined by a time - dependent star formation rate per unit volume , @xmath6 , a universal imf , @xmath7 , and some amount of dust reddening , can actually reproduce the optical data reasonably well .",
    "in such a system , the luminosity density at time @xmath8 is given by the convolution integral @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the specific luminosity radiated per unit initial mass by a generation of stars with age @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a time - independent term equal to the fraction of emitted photons which are not absorbed by dust . the function @xmath13 is derived from the observed uv luminosity density , and is then used as input to the population synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1_a _ shows the model predictions for the evolution of @xmath14 for a salpeter function , @xmath15 with smc - type dust ( in this case , the observed uv luminosities must be corrected upwards by a factor of 1.4 at 2800  and 2.1 at 1500  ) , and a star formation history which traces the rise , peak , and sharp drop of the uv emissivity .",
    ", stars below 0.8 @xmath16 make only a small contribution to the emitted light .",
    "this introduces a significant uncertainty in our estimates of the total stellar birthrate .",
    "for example , in the case of a salpeter imf with @xmath17 , the inferred star formation rate , @xmath18 , would decrease by a factor of 1.86 . ]   for simplicity , the metallicity was fixed to solar values and the imf truncated at 0.1 and 125 @xmath16 .",
    "the data points show the observed luminosity density in six broad passbands centered around 0.15 , 0.20 , 0.28 , 0.44 , 1.0 , and 2.2 .",
    "the model is able to account for the entire background light recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels probed by the _ hubble deep field _ ( hdf ) , and produces visible mass - to - light ratios at the present epoch which are consistent with the values observed in nearby galaxies of various morphological types .",
    "the bulk ( @xmath19 by mass ) of the stars present today formed relatively recently ( @xmath20 ) , consistently with the expectations from a broad class of hierarchical clustering cosmologies ( baugh 1997 ) , and in good agreement with the low level of metal enrichment observed at high redshifts in the damped lyman-@xmath21 systems ( pettini 1997a ) .",
    "one of the biggest uncertainties in our understanding of the evolution of luminous matter in the universe is represented by the poorly constrained amount of starlight that was absorbed by dust and reradiated in the far - ir at early epochs . while the model of figure 1_a _ reproduces quite well the rest - frame uv colors of high-@xmath3 objects in the hdf ,",
    "the prescription for a `` correct '' de - reddening of the lyman - break galaxies is the subject of an ongoing debate ( pettini 1997b and references therein ) .",
    "figure 1_b _ shows the model predictions for a monolithic collapse scenario , where half of the present - day stars were formed at @xmath22 and were enshrouded by dust .",
    "consistency with the hdf `` dropout '' analysis has been obtained assuming a dust extinction which increases rapidly with redshift , @xmath23 .",
    "this results in a correction to the rate of star formation by a factor of @xmath24 at @xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath27 . while still consistent with the global history of light , this model appears to overpredict the metal mass density at high redshifts as sampled by qso absorbers .",
    "ultimately , it should be possible to set some constraints on the total amount of star formation that is hidden by dust over the entire history of the universe by looking at the cosmic infrared background ( g. de zotti and b. guiderdoni , this volume ) .    in the next section",
    "we shall compute the expected evolution with cosmic time of the type ia and ii / ib , c supernova frequencies for the two star formation histories discussed above . by focusing on the integrated light radiated by the galaxy population as a whole",
    ", our approach will not specifically address the evolution and the sn rates of particular subclasses of objects , like the oldest ellipticals or low - surface brightness galaxies , whose star formation history may have differed significantly from the global average .",
    "single stars with mass @xmath28 evolve rapidly ( @xmath29 myr ) through all phases of central nuclear burning , ending their life as type ii sne with different characteristics depending on the progenitor mass . for",
    "a salpeter imf the core - collapse supernova rate can be related to the stellar birthrate according to @xmath30\\ , \\rd.\\ ] ] it is worth noting at this stage that our model predictions for the frequency of type ii events are largely independent of the assumed imf .",
    "this follows from the fact that the rest - frame uv continuum emission  which is used as an indicator of the instantaneous star formation rate  from all but the oldest galaxies is entirely dominated by massive stars on the main sequence , the same stars which later give origin to a type ii sn .",
    "the specific evolutionary history leading to a type ia event remains instead an unsettled question .",
    "sn ia are believed to result from the explosion of c - o white dwarfs ( wds ) triggered by the accretion of material from a companion , the nature of which is still unknown ( see ruiz - lapuente 1997 for a recent review ) . in a _",
    "double degenerate _",
    "( dd ) system , for example , such elusive companion is another wd : the exploding wd reaches the chandrasekhar limit and carbon ignition occurs at its center ( iben & tutukov 1984 ) . in the _ single degenerate _ ( sd ) model instead , the companion is a nondegenerate , evolved star that fills its roche lobe and pours hydrogen or helium onto the wd ( whelan & iben 1973 ; iben & tutukov 1984 ) . while in the latter the clock for the explosion is set by the lifetime of the primary star , and , e.g. , by how long it takes to the companion to evolve and fill its roche lobe , in the former it is controlled by the lifetime of the primary star and by the time it takes to shorten the separation of the two wds as a result of gravitational wave radiation .",
    "the evolution of the rate depends then , among other things , on the unknown mass distribution of the secondary binary components in the sd model , or on the distribution of the initial separations of the two wds in the dd model .    to shed light into the identification issue and ,",
    "in particular , on the clock - mechanism for the explosion of type ia s , a more empirical approach will be adopted here .",
    "i will parametrize the rate of type ia s in terms of a characteristic explosion timescale , @xmath31  which defines an explosion probability per wd assumed to be _ independent _ of time  and an explosion efficiency , @xmath32 .",
    "the former accounts for the time it takes in the various models to go from a _ newly born _",
    "( primary ) wd to the sn explosion itself : a spread of `` delay '' times results from the combination of a variety of initial conditions , such as the mass ratio of the binary system , the distribution of initial separations , the influence of metallicity on the mass transfer rate and accretion efficiency , etc .",
    "the latter simply accounts for the fraction of stars in binary systems that , because of unfavorable initial conditions , will never undergo a sn ia explosion .",
    "we consider as possible progenitors all systems in which the primary star has an _ initial _ mass higher than @xmath33 ( final mass @xmath34 , weidemann 1987 ) and lower than @xmath35 : stars less massive than @xmath36 will not produce a catastrophic event even if the companion has comparable mass , while stars more massive than @xmath37 will undergo core collapse , generating a type ii explosion .    with these assumptions the rate of type ia events at any one time will be given by the sum of the explosions of all the binary wds produced in the past that have not had the time to explode yet , i.e. @xmath38 where @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 is the minimum mass of a star that reaches the wd phase at time @xmath11 , and @xmath41 is the standard lifetime of a star of mass @xmath42 ( all stellar masses are expressed in solar units ) . for a fixed initial mass @xmath42 , the frequency of type ia events peaks at an epoch that reflect an `` effective '' delay @xmath43 from stellar birth . a prompter ( smaller @xmath31 ) explosion results in a higher sn ia rate at early epochs .",
    "observed rates of sne are normally given in units of snu , one snu corresponding to 1 sn per 100 years per @xmath44 .",
    "since a galaxy luminosity depends on @xmath45 , there is a factor @xmath46 involved in the inferred sn frequencies . in figure 2",
    "we show the predicted type ia and ii(+ib / c ) rest - frame frequencies as a function of redshift .",
    "expressed in snu , the type ii rate is basically proportional to the ratio between the uv and blue galaxy luminosity densities , and is therefore independent of cosmology . unlike the sn frequency per unit volume , which will trace the evolution of the stellar birthrate , the frequency of type ii events per unit",
    "blue luminosity is a monotonic increasing function of redshift , and depends only weakly on the assumed star formation history .",
    "the type ia rates plotted in the figure assume characteristic `` delay '' timescales after the collapse of the primary star to a wd equal to @xmath47 and 3 gyr , which virtually encompass all relevant possibilities .",
    "the sn ia explosion efficiency was left as an adjustable parameter to reproduce the observed ratio of sn ii to sn ia explosion rates in the local universe , @xmath48 , @xmath49 for the adopted models .",
    "note how , relative to the merging scenario , the monolithic collapse model predicts sn ia rates ( in snu ) that are , in the @xmath50 gyr case , a factor of 1.6 and 4.9 higher at @xmath51 and 4 , respectively .",
    "we have investigated the link between sn statistics and galaxy evolution . using recent estimates of the star formation history of field galaxies and a simple model for the evolutionary history of the binary system leading to a type ia event ,",
    "i have computed the theoretical type ia and type ii sn rates as a function of cosmic time .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "* at the present epoch , the predicted type ii(+ib / c ) frequency appears to match quite well , to within the errors , the observed local value .",
    "the sn ii rate is a sensitive function of the lower mass cutoff of the progenitors , @xmath52 .",
    "values as low as @xmath53 ( chiosi 1992 ) or as high as @xmath54 ( nomoto 1984 ) have been proposed in the literature : adopting a lower mass limit of 6 or 11 @xmath16 would increase or reduce our type ii rates by a factor 1.5 , respectively .",
    "* at low and intermediate redshifts , a comparison between the predicted and observed rates shows that the best match is obtained for a class of type ia progenitors in which the explosion epoch is delayed by a characteristic timescale @xmath55 gyr after the collapse of the primary stars to a wd , and a sn ia efficiency of order @xmath56 .",
    "accurate measurements of sn rates in the range @xmath57 would dramatically improve our understanding of the nature and physics of sn  ia explosions .",
    "ongoing searches and studies of distant sne ( garnavich 1997 ; perlmutter 1997 ) should provide these rates in the next few years . + * at higher redshifts , @xmath58 , the detection of type ii sne must await the _ next generation space telescope _ ( ngst ) .",
    "a sn ii has a typical peak magnitude @xmath59 ( e.g. patat 1994 ) : placed at @xmath25 , such an event would give rise to an observed flux at 1.8  of 15 njy . at this wavelength ,",
    "the imaging sensitivity of an 8 m ngst is 1 njy ( @xmath60 s exposure and @xmath61 detection threshold ) , while the moderate resolution ( @xmath62 ) spectroscopic limit is about 50 times higher ( @xmath63 s exposure per resolution element and @xmath61 detection threshold ) ( stockman 1997 ) .",
    "the several weeks period of peak rest - frame blue luminosity would be stretched by a factor of @xmath64 to few months .",
    "figure 3 shows the cumulative number of type ii events expected per year per @xmath65 field .",
    "depending on the history of star formation at high redshifts , the ngst should detect between 7 ( in the merging model ) and 15 ( in the monolithic collapse scenario ) type ii sne per field per year in the interval @xmath58 , therefore providing a way to distinguish between different scenarios of galaxy formation .",
    "the possibility of detecting type ii sne at @xmath66 from an early population of galaxies has been investigated by miralda - escud & rees ( 1997 ) . by assuming these are responsible for the generation of all the metals observed in the lyman-@xmath21 forest at high redshifts , a high baryon density ( @xmath67 ) , and an average metallicity of @xmath68 , miralda - escud & rees estimate the ngst should observe about 16 sn ii per field per year with @xmath69 .",
    "note , however , that a metallicity smaller by a factor @xmath70 compared to the value adopted by these authors has been recently derived by songaila ( 1997 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the models discussed in this talk predict between 1 and 10 type ii sne per field per year with @xmath71 .",
