    "then , @xmath1 is called a _ planar billiard _ when @xmath0 is smooth enough to allow the law of reflection to hold , off of a set of measure zero ( where the measure is taken to be the arc length measure on @xmath0 ) .",
    "though the law of reflection implicitly states that the angles of incidence and reflection be determined with respect to the normal to the line tangent at the basepoint , we adhere to the equivalent convention in the field of mathematical billiards that the vector describing the position and velocity of the billiard ball ( which amounts to the position and angle , since we are assuming unit speed ) be reflected in the tangent to the point of incidence .. ] that is , employing such a law in order to determine the path on which the billiard ball departs after impact essentially amounts to identifying certain vectors .",
    "such an equivalence relation is denoted by @xmath18 and , in the context of a polygonal billiard , is discussed below in more detail .    for the remainder of the article , unless otherwise indicated , when @xmath0 is a simple , closed , connected and piecewise smooth curve so as to allow the law of reflection to hold ( off finitely many points ) , we assume @xmath0 is a closed and connected polygon .",
