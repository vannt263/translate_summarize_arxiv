    "economic analysis of digital commodities is often made difficult by the absence of any marginal cost to the distributor  @xcite .",
    "although some goods maintain their propriety , many others ",
    "open - source software being a widely - studied example  are distributed online at no direct cost to the consumer .",
    "there are competing theories to explain the latter seemingly - uneconomic behavior including , for instance , an expectation of reciprocity  @xcite and reputation - seeking by the producers  @xcite . in either case , in order to begin to study the producer s decision - making process , we must construct a theory of utility which justifies potentially significant fixed costs , the details of which will likely depend on the peculiarities of the market at hand .    in this work",
    "we will focus our attention on the exchange of social gratification in online communities .",
    "this situation evidently falls into the category described above in which a commodity is exchanged but at no marginal cost to the supplier .",
    "the literature has indeed identified the acquisition of social capital as a central motivation for social media use  @xcite .",
    "we will proceed using the utility function introduced in @xcite , to be recalled in the next section .",
    "this formulation offers a local method of measuring the centrality of a member of a social network based on the rate at which he or she receives `` likes , '' calculated relative to the centralities of the individual s social neighbors . in the author s previous work , the equilibrium effects of prestige - seeking across the social network were considered . here we will work with the mathematical formalism itself to gain deeper insight into how it is calculated ( for its definition is recursive ) and to identify related metrics which may be sociologically relevant .",
    "we will consider an online social network over an undirected graph @xmath0 of order @xmath1 .",
    "agents may bestow `` likes '' upon each other with a non - negative rate .",
    "labeling @xmath0 s vertices from @xmath2 to @xmath1 , we let @xmath3 be the @xmath4 matrix in which the entry @xmath5 represents the rate at which @xmath6 `` likes '' @xmath7 .",
    "we require that no transactions occur between a pair for which there is no edge in @xmath0 ; ie .  if @xmath8 then @xmath9 .",
    "next we will define a centrality measure similar in concept to the random walk betweenness centrality of newman @xcite .",
    "[ p ] let @xmath0 be a connected undirected graph of order @xmath1 with nodes of degree @xmath10 . define a matrix @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the diagonal matrix with the given entries and @xmath0 here is the adjacency matrix of the graph @xmath0 .",
    "we will denote as @xmath13 the normalized eigenvector of @xmath14 corresponding to the eigenvalue of maximum magnitude as given by the perron - frobenius theorem .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath14 is a stochastic matrix .",
    "repeated multiplication by it therefore models the markov chain of a memoryless random walk over the graph @xmath0 .",
    "the eigenvector @xmath13 , the steady - state probability distribution over the vertices of @xmath0 , will become of use to us later .",
    "we will now define another centrality measure , this time using the matrix @xmath3 as well .",
    "we proceed in analogy to the well - known eigenvector centrality , but now scaling by the centralities of the neighboring nodes .",
    "such an adjustment simulates the effect of an individual s centrality appearing greater or lesser when compared to those with whom he interacts .",
    "[ lcdef ] let @xmath0 be an undirected graph of order @xmath1 and @xmath3 a real @xmath4 matrix with the criteria above .",
    "furthermore , let a likedness centrality vector @xmath15 be any vector of positive components satisfying the recursive relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 entry of @xmath0 s adjacency matrix .",
    "we will often identify the coordinates of this vector with the respective vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "note that is unaffected up to a scaling of @xmath15 and @xmath3 so this definition can not be unique .",
    "we remedy this as follows .",
    "define the _",
    "unique _ likedness centrality to be the vector @xmath19 satisfying both and @xmath20 where @xmath13 is as in definition [ p ] .",
    "if @xmath0 is connected as specified in definition [ p ] , then the components of @xmath13 are nonzero and uniqueness can be achieved simply by normalization .",
    "it will greatly simplify our notation henceforth to define for a non - isolated node @xmath7 @xmath22 thus we can rearrange to obtain @xmath23 recalling that definition [ lcdef ] disallows @xmath24 , and therefore @xmath25 , to be zero .",
    "iteratively applying this formula @xmath26 times yields @xmath27 the product is only nonzero when all of the @xmath28 are positive , which we specified occurs only when all of the edges @xmath29 are included in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to sum over all paths on @xmath0 of length @xmath26 beginning at @xmath30 .",
    "that is , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mean over all @xmath26-paths on @xmath0 of the form @xmath33 .",
    "for now we will refer to the number of @xmath26-paths from @xmath30 as @xmath34 . to work with the second factor",
    ", we will consider what happens when @xmath26 becomes large .",
    "we begin by rearranging the product into the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the number of times the vertex @xmath7 and the edge @xmath18 appear in the path .",
    "we call upon the law of large numbers to reinterpret the expectation operator as a mean over many random paths beginning at @xmath30 .",
    "the product over @xmath7 weighs all steps of the walk equally so for @xmath38 , the choice of @xmath39 and therefore the value of @xmath40 approaches independence from the product .",
    "this independence permits us to invoke multiplicativity of the expectation operator .",
    "we defined the transition matrix for a markov walk over a graph in definition [ p ] whence we can evaluate @xmath41 exactly .",
    "@xmath42 furthermore , the distribution of vertices follows the probability distribution resulting from the markov random walk on @xmath0 for which @xmath14 is the transition matrix .",
    "therefore , noting that the frequency of an edge is the frequency divided by the degree of the starting vertex , we have @xmath43 observe that we can also express the number of @xmath26-paths in terms of a sum of powers of @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the location at each step is a probability distribution over the graph s nodes derived from the same markov process as before .",
    "the graph s degree distribution then gives the number of possible transitions from each vertex .",
    "thus , @xmath44 which we can rearrange to fit into our expression for @xmath45",
    ". @xmath46^{\\left(\\sum_{t=0}^n p^t\\right)_{i_0,i}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result is far more intuitive than it may appear , although the manner in which it is arranged may hint at some simplifications .",
    "the scaling factor is that which we required to define the unique likedness centrality .",
    "furthermore , recalling the definition of @xmath25 , we can interpret the first term in the product , @xmath47 , to be the mean likedness of the nodes connected to @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the second term in the product is simply the geometric mean of the rates at which @xmath7 is `` liked '' by its connections .",
    "thus we have , adjusting the indexing , @xmath48 recalling our earlier assumptions which provide that @xmath49 . the astute reader might notice that because @xmath14 is stochastic , the perron - frobenius theorem guarantees that it has an eigenvalue of 1 and its geometric series does not therefore converge .",
    "although this is true , some experimentation reveals that despite the exponents being unbounded , the bases distribution both above and below unity leads to convergence of the product itself .",
    "the result of the previous section provides a qualitatively different interpretation as to how likedness centrality is calculated .",
    "we originally defined it as a local measure of the prominence of a node relative to his immediate neighbors .",
    "instead , we now define a score for every vertex in the network based on its local prominence and incorporate each , scaled by its closeness to @xmath7 , into the computation @xmath50 .",
    "this score is in a convenient form in as it appears independently of both the length of the walk and the agent whose centrality is being calculated .",
    "it is therefore sensible to study it as a property of a node in its own right .",
    "define the neighbor desirability of a non - isolated vertex @xmath7 to be the ratio of the geometric mean of the rates at which @xmath7 receives `` likes '' to the arithmetic mean of the likedness centralities of those with whom @xmath7 is connected .",
    "the equations derived in the last section illustrate that this ratio quantifies the desirability of being near @xmath7 in the network .",
    "neighbor desirability resembles likedness centrality in all ways but the fact that the former metric decreases strictly with respect to the likedness centrality of the neighboring nodes , whereas the effect is non - strict for the latter .",
    "more explicitly , it is most desirable to be near those who , though highly `` liked , '' are among those with little prestige themselves .",
    "this `` big fish in a small pond '' observation is provided robustly by despite the complexity resulting from heavy interdependence of the centralities throughout a community .",
    "the emergence of a geometric , not arithmetic , mean of rates may come as a surprise .",
    "this is not merely a formal distinction ; the geometric mean uses a far more egalitarian weighing of the samples .",
    "that is , even if a node @xmath7 `` likes '' at a far greater rate than another @xmath6 does , perturbing either rate by a fixed proportion of its starting value has an equivalent effect on the result of the mean .    in order to examine the structural factors of a network that may affect a vertex s neighbor desirability",
    ", we conduct a computer experiment as follows . we randomly select a graph @xmath0 of order 100 according to the barabasi - albert random graph distribution , the result of which is shown in figure [ g ] .",
    "this model is known to produce networks with realistic characteristics including preferential attachment ( yielding a scale - free degree distribution ) and low average path length  @xcite . for this fixed graph",
    "we randomly generate 10,000 `` like '' rate ensembles and compute the likedness centrality vector in each case , effectively yielding 1,000,000 distinctly operating individuals to study .",
    "the rates of `` liking '' are assumed to follow an exponential distribution with @xmath51 .    ,",
    "generated with the barabasi - albert model with parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( employing the authors notation ) .",
    "communities are identified according to a modularity - based clustering metric . ]",
    "it should be noted that although appears straightforward , the denominator in the product depends on a number of structural features of the graph as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "we therefore examine the effect of various centrality measures on the neighbor desirability . because all the standard metrics prove to exhibit a qualitatively similar trend , only those with the least noise are shown in figure [ centralities ] .",
    "consistent with the latter part of our prior `` big fish in a small pond '' criterion for neighbor desirability , well - connected nodes suffer a clear deficiency in desirability , with depletion most nearly resembling a power law .    .",
    "robust negative trends are identified on the log - log scale . in particular , the relationship between a node s neighbor desirability and betweenness centrality is closely given by @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . ]    to investigate the `` big fish '' effect we might also study the relationship between an agent s likedness centrality and neighbor desirability .",
    "this may seem like a trivial consideration given that desirability is proportional to the mean of the incoming rates , but that is to neglect the reciprocal nature of likedness centrality . nonetheless , a strong positive correlation between the two measures of centrality is found and depicted in figure [ corr ] .",
    "( @xmath56 ) . ]",
    "finally , we wish to determine whether connected pairs of nodes are more or less likely to have like neighbor desirabilities .",
    "the first panel in figure [ pairs ] illustrates that the most desirable neighbors are themselves proximate to worse neighbors on average .",
    "this trend becomes even more pronounced when we take into account the sampling bias introduced by the underlying distribution of neighbor desirability , shown in the second panel of the same figure .",
    "this observation and the prior regarding centrality measures become apparent in figure [ colors ] which shows @xmath0 with its vertices and edges colored according to their neighbor desirability and mean neighbor desirability , respectively .     ( @xmath55 ) . ]     is again plotted , now with vertices colored by their neighbor desirability ( increasing from blue to red ) .",
    "the previously - observed effects including inverse correlation with centrality and anti - homophily are apparent .",
    "a neutral node ( of unitary neighbor desirability ) appears as yellow ( @xmath57 ) . ]",
    "our first key finding is , an equivalent formulation of definition [ lc ] .",
    "this result is remarkable in that it begins with likedness centrality in a quasi - eigenvector centrality form , which only directly depends on a node s neighbors , and produces a global metric , which considers a characteristic of every vertex in the graph and scales them according to their proximities to the vertex at hand .",
    "this characteristic is found to be useful in and of itself as a measure of a node s effect on the social prestiges of others .",
    "we were able to identify several robust properties of this so - called `` neighbor desirability . ''",
    "first , distinct from likedness centrality , it correlates negatively with traditional structural centrality metrics ( figure [ centralities ] ) .",
    "then , as would be expected , we saw that desirable neighbors have more social capital on average ( figure [ corr ] ) .",
    "finally , desirable nodes tend to have connections with less desirable nodes on average ( figure [ pairs ] ) .",
    "these three factors combine to what we call the `` big fish in a small pond '' criterion according to which the most desirable neighbors tend to be very prominent but within less - esteemed circles .",
    "we conclude with a remark on the limitations of this study s methods . throughout the _ in silico _ experiments of section iv",
    ", we assumed that the entries of @xmath3 are independent and identically - distributed , neglecting any strategic behavior by the agents .",
    "therefore , we may only consider this to be a study of the neighbor desirability metric itself and not of features of realistic communities which respond to it and its derivatives .",
    "strategic optimization of likedness centrality in particular has been investigated in @xcite , which shows that societies of prestige - seeking agents can produce some emergent network features .",
    "a similar analysis must be done for neighbor desirability , though the problem of finding equilibrium rate matrices is made difficult by the large number of variables and nonlinearity of likedness centrality .",
