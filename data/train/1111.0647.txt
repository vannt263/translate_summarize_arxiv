    "heavy quarks and quarkonia are hard probes of heavy - ion collisions ; they are produced in hard processes in the initial moments of the collision and exist at all stages of the event . as a result ,",
    "any calculation related to heavy quarks must consider nearly every aspect of heavy - ion physics : shadowing and anti - shadowing of the parton distribution functions , the perturbative cross sections , the finite - temperature evolution of heavy flavor , and finally , in - medium hadronization .",
    "any calculation which neglects any of these steps and compares with an observable must quantitatively justify why the step was ignored .    as a result ,",
    "the heavy quark and quarkonium observables in heavy - ion collisions now have a history beginning with qualitative understanding followed by scrutiny with simulation . as an example , consider the changes in @xmath1 yields caused by finite - temperature effects .",
    "these changes were first described as being caused by the non - abelian analog of the photo - electric effect @xcite , and were estimated to be small .",
    "a large @xmath1 suppression was also predicted because of debye screening of the @xmath2 potential , which had been seen in lattice calculations @xcite ; the result suggested so large an effect that @xmath1 suppression was hoped to be the  smoking gun \" for formation of quark - gluon plasma in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "an  anomalous \" suppression was indeed observed by the collaborations at the sps @xcite .",
    "however , the results from rhic indicate a more complicated suppression pattern than what can be described with the original results for large suppression @xcite : the suppression at rhic was small in comparison to expectations based on the results from sps .",
    "since then , heavy quark observables have been examined more carefully than had been done in the first semi - analytic predictions : the flow of heavy flavor has been estimated using hard thermal loop effective theory and a hydrodynamical description of heavy - ion collisions @xcite ; the rates for destruction and regeneration of @xmath1 particles at finite - temperature have been calculated using finite - temperature heavy quark effective theory and potentials from lattice qcd , and these rates were applied to the results at rhic and the lhc @xcite ; and finally , @xmath1 suppression was described with heavy quark diffusion and this description was integrated with a 2 + 1-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation for estimating changes in @xmath1 yields at rhic @xcite .",
    "most recently , the rates for thermal quarkonium suppression were calculated away from thermal equilibrium , for viscous plasmas , and applied to the suppression of bottomonium states at the lhc @xcite .",
    "event generation is a promising approach to keeping all of the steps under control while adding new physical considerations . in this paper , we describe modifications made to the martini event generator @xcite , which has been used successfully for examining jets and photons at rhic and the lhc @xcite .",
    "we cover the physics of heavy quarks  chronologically \" : in section [ production ] production , then in - medium evolution in section [ evolution ] , and finally hadronization in section [ hadronization ] .",
    "the new physical considerations of this paper are mostly in the section on hadronization , and their implementation in martini represents an important part of what monte carlo can do that is difficult analytically without many simplifying assumptions .",
    "we compute the results for observables at rhic and the lhc in section [ observables ] and make a prediction of the yields of @xmath0 mesons , which are produced in heavy - ion collisions almost entirely recombinantly .",
    "finally in the conclusions , areas where future work is needed are pointed out .",
    "because of the masses of charm and bottom quarks , which are large compared with @xmath3 and with the temperatures accessible in heavy - ion collisions , the processes producing these quarks have a large energy scale and can be described perturbatively .",
    "heavy quarks are like high - energy jets in that their initial production in a heavy - ion collision is some elaboration of the production in proton - proton collisions .",
    "also , the thermal production of charm and bottom quarks in heavy - ion collisions is likely small : t - channel gluon - gluon scattering which contributes most to the thermal heavy quark production is suppressed by two factors of the initial bose - einstein distributions of these gluons . for this reason , we consider only heavy quarks produced initially in the nuclear collision .    however , even perturbative production of heavy quarks is complicated by nuclear effects in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "first of all , the parton distribution functions in a heavy - ion collision are modified because of isospin . every nucleon s parton distribution can be described with the weighted average of the neutron and proton distribution functions , @xmath4 , to take this effect into account .",
    "an effect with greater significance for heavy quark production is the shadowing of the parton distribution functions by nucleons at the same point in the transverse plane , and the effect of anti - shadowing required by momentum conservation .",
    "these modifications have a satisfying description in color glass condensate effective theory , and if the saturation scale @xmath5 the color glass condensate would be the best tool for describing heavy quark production at rhic and the lhc @xcite .",
    "gluon saturation likely does cause some of the anomalous nuclear modification of @xmath1 production , however it can not explain all of the observed modification .",
    "another approach is more phenomenological and practical for event generation : parametrizing the parton distribution functions for nucleons in bound states , and simply evolving these according to leading - twist dglap evolution @xcite .",
    "another complication in the initial production arises at high-@xmath6 relative to the heavy quark s mass . in the factorized approach to heavy quark production ,",
    "the perturbative production at next - to - leading order contains terms depending on @xmath7 , which need to be resummed when @xmath8 . working with ",
    "massless \" fragmentation into hadrons can give the correct results at high @xmath6 while now neglecting terms proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "cacciari et al .",
    "effectively merged the results at fixed order in perturbation theory ( accurate at low @xmath6 ) and next - to - leading log order ( accurate at high @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "we use pythia8.1 to sample the six - dimensional momentum distributions of @xmath2 systems .",
    "this works only at leading - order in perturbation theory , as almost all state - of - the - art event generators do not include higher orders ; including all of the elements in pythia at higher orders is problematic because of increases in the complexity of phase spaces .",
    "however , some part of the higher - order behavior is considered by setting the total cross section of charm by hand ( we use 0.6 @xmath10 for proton - proton collisions at rhic and 3.0 @xmath10 for the lhc ) . the nuclear shadowing is taken into account using eks98 nuclear parton distribution functions , and isospin effects are taken into account by sampling from p+p , n+p , p+n , and n+n collisions .",
    "finally , the spatial dimensions of the phase - space distribution for the @xmath2 states must be sampled .",
    "we use the glauber model to determine the initial centers of mass of the pairs in the transverse plane .",
    "an important additional consideration is required by the non - zero thermalization time @xmath11 in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we evolve the heavy quarks during this time according to the equations of motion determined by the zero - temperature cornell potential :    @xmath12    these equations are not _ manifestly _ lorentz - invariant due to the frame - dependent @xmath13 , however , it is defined in the center - of - mass frame of the pair for reasons in section [ hadronization ] , making the equations of motion lorentz - invariant while neglecting radiative effects .",
    "the equations of motion in the following section generalize these for temperature - dependent potentials and diffusive effects .",
    "the leapfrog method is used to achieve sufficient numerical accuracy : simpler discretizations of the equations of motion were found to have unacceptably large rounding errors at forward rapidities .",
    "radiative  splittings \" of high - energy partons , which are a significant source of in - medium evolution for high-@xmath6 massless partons , are suppressed for heavy quarks because of the  dead - cone \" effect , already known from jet physics @xcite .",
    "the evolution of heavy quarks at finite temperature is approximated as being caused by elastic collisions in the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation of qcd . at the temperatures accessible in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "thermal heavy quarks exist in the  diffusive limit \" of dynamics . to understand qualitatively why this is so , consider a heavy quark with mass @xmath14 , with @xmath15 . in the hard thermal limit of qcd",
    ", the heavy quark suffers kicks leading to momentum transfers on the order of @xmath16 .",
    "the typical momentum transfer is therefore much smaller than the heavy quark mass , meaning that it takes many kicks to change significantly the momentum of the heavy quarks .",
    "the dynamics of heavy quarks undergoing elastic processes can thus be approximated as diffusive , and therefore _ differential _ in time .",
    "many general properties can be calculated directly from the langevin equation . in the rest frame of the medium , @xmath17 { \\rm , } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a drag coefficient , @xmath19 the stochastic force on the heavy quark , and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) the longitudinal ( transverse ) momentum diffusion coefficient .",
    "often we will approximate @xmath22 , which is true non - relativistically .",
    "these calculations , along with the requirement that an ensemble described by this equation thermalizes , leads to the einstein relation @xmath23 .",
    "however to simulate individual events , being able to calculate ensemble averages only is inadequate ; this stochastic differential equation needs to be discretized .",
    "the central limit theorem provides the means to do this : over a sufficiently long timestep @xmath24 , the _ sum _ of many random kicks is described by a gaussian with width @xmath25 . in the end",
    ", we use monte carlo also in solving the in - medium evolution equation .    in the diffusive approximation ,",
    "one physical parameter needs to be determined : @xmath26 , the spatial diffusion coefficient for the heavy quark .",
    "it can be related to @xmath27 and @xmath18 by examining the expectation value of @xmath28 with the eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) , and can be calculated in the non - relativistic limit as caused by a t - channel gluon exchange in the hard thermal approximation of qcd @xcite , which has been done at next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "it has also been calculated in supersymmetric large-@xmath29 qcd at strong coupling using gauge - gravity duality @xcite , as well as in gravity models of the dual for qcd @xcite .",
    "the gravity calculations , as well as the poor convergence of htl effective theory , point to a small diffusion coefficient , @xmath30 . in the simulations that follow we set @xmath31 and do not consider here the effects of tuning this parameter , which has large effects on open heavy flavor but smaller effects on the total quarkonium yields .",
    "the dead - cone effect causes brehmsstrahlung to be suppressed in the cone within an angle @xmath32 around the direction of a heavy quark s momentum .",
    "we would expect this cone to shrink at high momenta , causing the dead - cone effect not to be significant and the effect of brehmsstrahlung to be no longer negligible , and indeed , the momenta accessible at the lhc are well into this range .",
    "for this reason , a future paper will determine the effect of brehmsstrahlung on heavy quarks , as well as describe the heavy quarks at lower momenta without the diffusive approximation .",
    "there is one final consideration for the dynamics of heavy quarks that we need to make : the self - interaction of @xmath33 color singlets at finite temperature is not negligible , as can be seen with reliable lattice calculations of the correlation between two wilson lines at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the effect of temperature on the potential can not be neglected ; in fact , the earliest prediction of significant @xmath1 suppression was based entirely on changes in this potential with temperature .",
    "this raises another physical question : what thermodynamic potential of @xmath33 color singlets is appropriate to use , the internal energy used for adiabatic processes , or the free energy used for isothermal processes ?",
    "this question has been investigated by comparing potential model results for quarkonium correlation functions with the results from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "it remains difficult to distinguish which potential is best for quarkonium at finite temperature .",
    "we continue to use the internal energy as a function of temperature , as was done in @xcite , based on the reasoning in @xcite comparing the timescales of binary bound states , related to the binding energies of these states , to the relaxation times of the medium at finite temperature .",
    "heavy quarks hadronize into mesons with either one or two heavy quarks .",
    "because heavy quarks are produced almost entirely in flavor - conserving processes , heavy quarks are produced with an anti - quark of the same flavor and both of these possibilities for hadronic final states need to be considered , particularly at center - of - mass energies near thresholds for quarkonium ; the production of a given hadronic state should never be considered singly .",
    "first , consider open heavy flavor : a single heavy quark @xmath34 with momentum @xmath35 fragments into a hadron @xmath36 with momentum @xmath37 , leading to an energy difference @xmath38 between the initial and final state .",
    "general quantum - mechanical arguments lead one to estimate the probability for a given transition to be @xmath39 , leading to the peterson fragmentation formula @xcite : @xmath40 { \\rm .}\\ ] ] in martini , whenever heavy quarks are determined to lead to open heavy flavor mesons , this function is sampled to determine the momentum fraction of the resulting meson . at this point in time , for simplicity , the various open heavy flavor states are not distinguished .",
    "the previous argument assumed that the heavy quark was sufficiently energetic ( and slightly off - shell ) so that a final open flavor state was kinematically accessible . considering the possibility that this state is not accessible allows one to estimate the production of hidden heavy flavor states .",
    "given a heavy quark and anti - quark , with momenta @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , whose spatial separation in the lab frame is given by @xmath43 , we define the modified invariant mass of the pair to be @xmath44 where @xmath45 may be reasonably approximated at chemical freezeout with the cornell potential .",
    "this invariant mass determines what final states are kinematically accessible to the pair if it hadronizes adiabatically ; if @xmath46 , open heavy flavor would be kinematically inaccessible to the pair and the final state must be quarkonium .    in this way , our method of hadronization resembles the color evaporation model @xcite , which examines simply the invariant mass of the pair to determine whether or not quarkonium is formed .",
    "the color evaporation model is quite successful in determining the quarkonium yields in experiments using a range of targets and projectiles , however , it makes no predictions concerning the important observable of @xmath1 polarization .",
    "the color singlet model @xcite and applications of nrqcd @xcite make accurate predictions of the @xmath1 yields only with some tuning but after being calculated to higher orders in perturbation theory are yielding better agreement while describing polarization .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "the distinctions between the mesons are often ignored .",
    "specifically , peterson fragmentation leads to the production of @xmath47 mesons , without @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 mesons distinguished , and while the color evaporation model can use the invariant masses of the pairs to separate the quarkonium into various excited states , there is no distinction made between @xmath51 and the three polarizations of @xmath1 .",
    "these states can have similar masses but different quantum numbers leading to different decay channels .",
    "for this reason , the final yields calculated with martini need to be multiplied by well - defined correction factors before being compared with data , for example the yields of ground - state quarkonium , when being compared with @xmath1 yields , needs to be multiplied by a factor of 3/4 so that the @xmath51 particles are not included in the yields . for some processes , for example @xmath52 annihilation , such a factor would be inappropriate ( the @xmath51 has the wrong quantum numbers for this process and is not produced at all ) , however in heavy - ion collisions these quantum numbers are best estimated as entirely randomized , leading to each state s yields being proportional to its degeneracy .",
    "heavy - ion collisions lead to the possibility of _ recombinant _ quarkonium production . because of the masses of heavy quarks",
    ", there is at leading order only one hard process leading to heavy quark production per proton - proton collision ; the production of multiple heavy quarks is subleading in @xmath53 .",
    "however in a heavy - ion collision , there can be many such hard processes : in a typical central gold - gold collision at rhic @xmath5420 heavy quark pairs are produced and at the lhc @xmath54100 pairs .",
    "this forces us to consider the possibility that a heavy quark from one hard process and an anti - quark from a different hard process might have an invariant mass below the threshold of @xmath55 and may form quarkonium .    to determine recombinant production , we do not assume that the heavy quarks hadronize adiabatically ; instead the bulk of the collision is assumed to act like a heat bath at temperature @xmath56 , the chemical freezeout temperature for quarkonium .",
    "the possible final states for the heavy quarks are assumed to be open heavy flavor mesons and quarkonium ( baryons with open heavy flavor , while interesting , are subleading and not considered here ) .",
    "each possible  pairing \" of the @xmath57 heavy quarks and anti - quarks is determined by some @xmath58 , an element of the permutation group @xmath59 . finally , we associate with each of these pairings an energy : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is determined as in eq .",
    "( [ invariantmass ] ) .",
    "now that both an energy for each of these pairings and a temperature are defined , we can simply weight each pairing by its boltzmann factor to determine the yields for recombinant production .",
    "the previous argument applies well for an infinite volume cooling uniformly , however in heavy - ion collisions , this limit is not appropriate for estimating recombinant quarkonium production .",
    "heavy quarks reach their chemical freezeout surface at different times , and it is appropriate for a heavy quark @xmath34 to hadronize based on the phase space of heavy quarks _ at the time q hadronizes_. for this reason , the hadronization of heavy quarks is determined in martini according to this three step algorithm :    * when @xmath62 for a heavy quark @xmath34 , the modified color evaporation model is used to determine whether or not it forms quarkonium with the other heavy quark created in the perturbative process that created @xmath34 .",
    "if quarkonium is formed , then the hadronization stops here .",
    "this channel for quarkonium production is possible for heavy quark pairs produced in regions of the transverse plane at temperatures both above and below the deconfinement phase transition , and takes into account the heavy quark pairs that are not significantly affected by in - medium dynamics . *",
    "if quarkonium has not formed , then recombinant production is considered .",
    "all oppositely charged heavy quarks are checked with the color evaporation model for recombinant production with @xmath34 and all such heavy quarks are added to the list .",
    "if the set is non - empty , then one of these heavy quarks is sampled and a quarkonium state is formed with @xmath34 . in this situation",
    "the boltzmann factor for open heavy flavor production is so small that we neglect it .",
    "this channel for production is only available to heavy quarks that exist in qgp .",
    "this channel is also not available for the directly produced quarkonium ( quarkonium formed in the previous hadronization step ) as it is approximated as kinematically unavailable to the heavy quarks in these states . *",
    "if neither surviving or recombinant quarkonium has formed , the peterson fragmentation function for @xmath34 is sampled and an open heavy flavor meson is formed .",
    "notice that we use two thermodynamic limits for heavy quark hadronization : adiabatic for peterson fragmentation and color evaporation for direct production , and isothermal for recombinant production .",
    "while the use of these different limits is well - motivated physically , more work in this area can and should be done , especially since all hadronic observables are sensitive to this final step .",
    "we now apply martini to observables at rhic and the lhc . to maximize the understanding of these effects , we will not consider feed - down of excited quarkonium or @xmath0 mesons into ground states of quarkonium .",
    "vertex detection will allow semi - leptonic weak decays of @xmath0 and other b - hadrons to be observed relatively easily , and these hadrons to be identified , while the use of tracking should allow di - particle invariant mass distributions besides the dielectron invariant mass spectrum to be used to find excited quarkonium ; for example , the @xmath63 invariant mass spectrum can be used to determine the yields of @xmath64 in heavy - ion collisions . indeed",

    "@xmath67 denotes the  anomalous \" nuclear modification factor : a significant suppression is caused by inelastic scattering of quarkonium with the nucleons in the original gold nucleus , and this is not taken into account .",
    "the pattern of suppression in these plots is consistent with sequential quarkonium dissociation : excited quarkonium is destroyed more efficiently than is quarkonium in the ground state , due to the ground state s large binding energy relative to the temperature @xcite",
    ". however , this suppression pattern appears here without enforcing the sequential dissociation above predetermined dissociation temperatures for the quarkonium states by hand ; this pattern occurs simply because less energy has to be transferred from the medium to a @xmath2 system with a small binding energy to excite it above the @xmath68 threshold than needs to be transferred to a more more tightly - bound @xmath2 system . also noteworthy",
    "is the size of the recombinant contribution to production . it is larger than was estimated in @xcite .",
    "simple estimates of recombinant production fail to take into account the strong correlation of charm quarks in position , because of their scaling with number of collisions in the transverse plane which peaks sharply at the center .",
    "also , martini , by simulating the full event , correctly fluctuates the number of charm quarks per event and considers events with more charm quarks than average , taking into account the large recombinant production possible in those events .",
