    "replica exchange molecular dynamics ( remd ) is one of the most popular methods to accelerate the conformational sampling of large biomolecules and other complex molecular systems @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a generalization to molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of the replica exchange monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of remd is to evolve concurrently several copies ( or replica ) of the system , and periodically swap their temperatures in a thermodynamically consistent way .",
    "when a replica feels an artificially high temperature , it explores its conformation space much faster than it would at the physical temperature ; when it feels the physical temperature , equilibrium averages can be extracted from its dynamics . in theory , the efficiency of remd increases when the frequency of swaps is pushed up to infinity , but reaching this limit has proven difficult in practice  @xcite . recently in ref .",
    ", plattner _",
    "et al . _ have proposed a way to avoid this difficulty .",
    "the idea is to first establish analytically what the limiting dynamics of remd is at infinite swapping frequency , and then implement this dynamics directly instead of trying to increase the swapping frequency in the original remd .",
    "our main purpose here is to show that a natural reformulation of the technique of ref .",
    "leads to a simple method in which the various replica in infinite swapping remd evolve by standard md over a new potential that is a temperature - dependent mixture of the original one which couples all the replica .",
    "this new method is simple to implement , and reduces to a patch of standard md codes in which several replica of the system are evolved in parallel using forces that are the original molecular ones multiplied by factors that involve the energies of the replicas : these energies are the only quantities that must be communicated between the replicas as they evolve .",
    "the method gives a new perspective on how to optimally choose the temperatures ( including how many of them to pick ) , with implications for the original remd , by analyzing simple geometrical characteristics of the mixture potential .",
    "as we show below , it also permits to design generalizations of remd in which parameters other than the temperature are used to build the mixture potential .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we will consider first the case of a system governed by the overdamped langevin equation ( the generalization to standard md will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : reform ] below ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the instantaneous position of the system with @xmath2 particles , @xmath3 is the force associated with the potential @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the inverse temperature , @xmath6 is a @xmath7-dimensional white - noise and we set the friction coefficient to one for simplicity . the solutions of   sample the boltzmann equilibrium probability density , @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "assuming we only take two temperatures ( the generalization to more temperatures is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : ntemp ] below ) , the idea behind remd is to replace   by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the two replica , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two temperatures that alternatively swap between the physical @xmath15 and the artificial @xmath16 ( so that @xmath17 ) . these swaps are attempted with frequency  @xmath18 , and the ones from @xmath19 to @xmath20 are accepted with probability @xmath21 and similarly for the ones from @xmath22 to @xmath23 . is the standard acceptance probability used in metropolis monte carlo schemes and it guarantees that samples the following equilibrium probability distribution in @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the kronecker delta function , @xmath27 if @xmath28 and @xmath29 otherwise . summing over @xmath30 then gives the equilibrium density for the replica positions alone , which is a symmetrized version of the boltzmann densities at the two temperatures @xmath15 and @xmath31 : @xmath32 as a result the ensemble average at the physical temperature of any observable @xmath33 can be estimated from    @xmath34    where we defined the weight @xmath35 the estimator   is slightly different from the one traditionally used in remd  @xcite , but its validity can be readily checked by inserting   and   in  , and it will prove more convenient for our purpose . to quantify the efficiency of this estimator , notice that @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and we used the property that @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the variance of the estimator   is controlled by the variance of @xmath33 under the original density @xmath41 .",
    "this means that the efficiency of this estimator is determined by how fast the coupled system   converges towards equilibrium . as mentioned before , the higher @xmath18 , the faster this convergence is @xcite , but large values of @xmath18 requires one to make many swapping attempts , which slows down the simulations . the key observation made in ref .",
    "is that the limit @xmath42 can be taken explicitly . in this limit",
    ", the fast temperatures are adiabatically slaved to the positions of the slow replica , and these replica only feel their average effect .",
    "this leads to the following closed equation for the replica positions replacing  : @xmath43 thus , simulating with   instead of   is a concrete way to perform infinite swapping remd , and several strategies to perform these simulations were discussed in ref .  .",
    "here we would like to take advantage of these strategies but simplify their implementation by modifying  .",
    "how to do so is explained next .",
    "the system   is quite complicated to simulate because it involves a multiplicative noise . yet",
    "because this system satisfies detailed balance like the original remd   does , it has a specific structure that can be used to simplify it . to see how , note that the fokker - planck equation for the joint probability density of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath44 , can be written as @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote , respectively , the divergence and gradient operators with respect to @xmath48 , and we defined the mixture potential @xmath49 as well as the tensor @xmath50 : @xmath51 it is easy to check that the stationary solution of   is @xmath52 , confirming that the limiting equation   samples   like does and therefore can be used in the estimator  .",
    "the multiplicative nature of the noise in   is a direct consequence of the fact that the tensor @xmath53 in   depends on @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , a natural simplification is to replace @xmath53 by a constant tensor , which , for convenience , we will simply take to be the identity",
    ". this substitution does not affect the stationary solution of  , but it changes the system of overdamped langevin equations this fokker - planck equation is associated with . after some straightforward algebra , it is easy to see that this new system is @xmath56 this system of equations samples   like   does , and its solution can be used in the estimator  .",
    "but in contrast with  , the noise in   is simply additive like in the original equation  .",
    "the only things that have changed in   are the forces , which are the gradients with respect to @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the mixture potential  . as can be seen from  , these gradients involve the original forces , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , multiplied by scalar factors containing the weight  .",
    "this means that the only quantities that must be communicated between the replicas are the potential energies @xmath59 and @xmath60 that enter this weight .    in practice , rather than   one is typically interested in systems governed by the langevin equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the mass and @xmath63 the friction coefficient , in which case the generalization of   reads @xmath64 the solution of these equations can also be used in the estimator   and they can be simulated in parallel using a simple patch of a standard md code since they too only involve the modification of the forces discussed above .",
    "the extension to molecular dynamics using other heat baths is straightforward . in the sequel",
    ", we will analyze the performance of  , test it on several examples , and generalize this system to situations with more than two temperatures and where other parameters than the temperature are used to build the mixture potential .",
    "the simple form of or allows for a transparent explanation why these equations are more efficient than the original   or   at sampling the equilibrium density , and how to choose the artificial temperature @xmath66 to optimize this efficiency gain . to see this ,",
    "consider a situation in which the original potential @xmath4 has a minimum of energy at @xmath67 .",
    "then the mixture potential @xmath68 has a minimum at @xmath69 , with two channels connected to it along which this potential is a scaled down version of the original one , see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for an illustration . indeed , if the artificial temperature in   is much higher than the physical one , @xmath70 , then in the channel where @xmath71 we have @xmath72 in the region where @xmath73 , and similarly in the channel where @xmath74 .",
    "thus , along these channels , the equation for @xmath54 in   can be approximated locally by @xmath75 and similarly for @xmath55 .",
    "is like the original langevin equation   except that the force has been multiplied by a factor @xmath76 , meaning the energy barriers have been lowered by this same factor along the channels . in essence , by remaining close to a minimum of the energy , each replica helps the other to surmount barriers and explore the landscape towards other minima , and this is what accelerates the sampling .",
    "note however that , while a replica moves fast along a channel , its weight in the estimator   is close zero whereas the one of the replica that hovers near @xmath67 is close to one .",
    "indeed when @xmath54 moves and @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and similarly when @xmath55 moves and @xmath80 .",
    "thus we really need both replica to move in succession , with one of them hovering near a minimum while the other explores the landscape and vice - versa , to achieve proper sampling .",
    "concerning the choice of temperature , the form of   suggests that the optimal @xmath81 to pick is the highest energy barrier that the system needs to surmount to explore its landscape : at lower values of @xmath65 , crossing this barrier is still a rare event , and at higher values , we start to blur the sampling by having the system visit regions of too high energies . as we illustrate next on examples ,",
    "this intuition is correct , except that entropic effects also play an important role in high dimension and may slow down the sampling unless additional replicas with temperatures between @xmath82 and @xmath83 are introduced ( as will be done in sec .",
    "[ sec : ntemp ] ) .    to test and and verify the results above ,",

    "as mentioned in sec .  [ sec : efficiency ] , in high dimension entropic effects start to matter and slow down convergence unless more than two temperature are used . to analyze the impact of the dimensionality consider a system with @xmath104 dimensions moving on the following potential @xmath105 where @xmath106 are parameters controlling the curvature of the potential in the @xmath107 directions . in the original equation  , the dynamics in the @xmath104 directions are independent , but this is no longer the case for the limiting equation   over the mixture potential . when the dimensionality is large , @xmath108 , it has the effect that the replica moving in the channel by   seldom comes close to a local minimum of the potential because the basin around this minimum is quite wide ; at the same time , it has to come close enough to one such minimum to allow the other replica to starts moving in a channel . as can be seen in fig .",

[ ] ) but gives a different perspective on it .",
