    "<S> exists an @xmath18 such that for all sufficiently large @xmath12 , @xmath19    we treated the case @xmath20 in @xcite ( see also the overview in @xcite ) , where we obtained a similar statement with @xmath21 in place of @xmath22 . </S>",

    "<S> these results show that internal dla in dimensions @xmath29 is extremely close to a perfect sphere : when the cluster @xmath0 has the same size as a ball of radius @xmath12 , its fluctuations around that ball are confined to the @xmath22 scale ( versus @xmath21 in dimension @xmath30 ) . in  @xcite we explained that our method for @xmath20 would also apply in dimensions @xmath2 with the @xmath21 replaced by @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we outlined the changes needed in higher dimensions ( stating that the full proof would follow in this paper ) and included a key step : lemma  a , which bounds the probability of `` thin tentacles '' in the internal dla cluster in all dimensions . </S>",

    "<S> we remark that in @xcite we used an estimate from @xcite to start this iteration , while here we have modified the argument slightly so that this a priori estimate is no longer required .    </S>",
    "<S> one way for @xmath25 to deviate from the radius @xmath12 sphere is for it to have a single `` tentacle '' extending beyond the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the thin tentacle estimate ( * ? ? ? * lemma  a ) essentially says that in dimensions @xmath2 , the probability that there is a tentacle of length @xmath31 and volume less than a small constant times @xmath32 ( near a given location ) is at most @xmath33 . by summing over all locations </S>",
    "<S> , one may use this to show that the length of the longest `` thin tentacle '' produced before time @xmath1 is @xmath3 . to complete the proof of theorem [ thm : logfluctuations ] , we will have to show that other types of deviations from the radius @xmath12 sphere are also unlikely .    </S>",
    "<S> lemma a of @xcite was also proved for @xmath20 , albeit with @xmath33 replaced by @xmath34 . </S>",

    "<S> we bound these other fluctuations in higher dimensions via the same scheme introduced in  @xcite , which involves constructing and estimating certain martingales related to the growth of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out the quadratic variations of these martingales are , with high probability , of order @xmath35 when @xmath36 and of constant order when @xmath2 , closely paralleling what one obtains for the discrete gaussian free field ( as outlined in more detail in @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> the history of fluctuation bounds such as the one in corollary  [ cor : bound ] is as follows . in 1991 , lawler , bramson , and griffeath proved that the limit shape of internal dla from a point is the ball in all dimensions @xcite . in 1995 </S>",
    "<S> lawler gave a more quantitative proof , showing that the fluctuations of @xmath25 from the ball of radius  @xmath12 are at most of order @xmath37 @xcite . in december 2009 , the present authors announced the bound @xmath26 on fluctuations in dimension @xmath20 @xcite and gave an overview of the argument , making clear that the details remained to be written . in april 2010 , </S>",
