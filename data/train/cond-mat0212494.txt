    "recent advances in nanotechnology enable detailed investigations of a variety of quantum effects in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "these investigations are of primary interest because of fundamental importance of such effects as well due to rapidly growing number of their potential applications . a great deal of information",
    "is usually obtained from studying electron transport .",
    "additional / complementary information can be extracted from investigations of fluctuation effects , such as shot noise @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was demonstrated @xcite that the power spectrum of the shot noise in coherent mesoscopic conductors is expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath4 here and below @xmath1 stands for the transmission of the @xmath2-th conducting channel of a coherent conductor .",
    "thus , since transport measurements only allow to determine the combination @xmath5 studies of the shot noise provide additional valuable information about the transmission distribution of conducting modes .",
    "the above results apply to the situations when interaction between electrons can be neglected . in the presence of electron - electron interactions",
    "the landauer conductance ( [ landauer ] ) and the @xmath6 curve are modified in a non - trivial way .",
    "recently it was shown @xcite that the @xmath6 curve of a ( comparatively short ) coherent conductor with arbitrary transmission distribution @xmath1 in the presence of interactions can be expressed in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a _ universal _",
    "function to be defined below .",
    "this result holds in the limit of large conductances @xmath9 or , otherwise , at sufficiently high temperatures / voltages .",
    "it demonstrates that the magnitude of the interaction correction is controlled by _ the same _",
    "parameter @xmath10 ( [ landr ] ) which is already well known in the theory of shot noise .",
    "physically this result can easily be understood since both phenomena are related to discrete nature of the electron charge .",
    "hence , there exists a direct link between shot noise and interaction effects in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "it is obvious that not only the @xmath6 curve ( [ univ ] ) but also shot noise as well as higher moments of the current operator should be affected by electron - electron interactions .",
    "this paper is devoted to a detailed investigation of current fluctuations in mesoscopic coherent conductors in the presence of electron - electron interactions .",
    "previously various aspects of this problem have been studied for a particular case of tunnel junctions in the coulomb blockade regime , see , e.g. refs . .",
    "the effect of interactions on shot noise in 2d diffusive conductors at sufficiently high temperatures was recently addressed in ref . .    here",
    "we will employ a model of a coherent conductor @xcite . within this model",
    "we will demonstrate that interactions lead to two different corrections to the shot noise spectrum .",
    "one of these corrections scales with the parameter @xmath10 ( [ landr ] ) .",
    "this correction is always _ negative _ , similarly to that found in eq .",
    "( [ univ ] ) for the @xmath6 curve .",
    "it describes ( partial ) suppression of the current noise due to coulomb blockade .",
    "in addition to this correction we shall find another one , which is proportional to the parameter @xmath11 this second correction is _ positive _ , i.e. it leads to relative enhancement of the shot noise .",
    "the latter correction turns out to be important only at voltages exceeding both frequency and temperature and is negligible otherwise .",
    "thus , at sufficiently high voltages two interaction corrections  negative and positive  compete , for @xmath12 the second one wins and , hence , in this case an overall enhancement of the shot noise by interactions is predicted .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will describe the model and highlight our key results . a detailed derivation of these results",
    "is then performed in section 3 .",
    "our main conclusions are briefly summarized in section 4 .",
    "most of the technical details , such as the derivation of our effective action as well as a few other issues are presented in appendices a , b and c.",
    "similarly to refs . we will consider a coherent scatterer between two big reservoirs .",
    "the scatterer is described by an arbitrary distribution of transmissions @xmath1 of its conducting modes , and the corresponding landauer conductance @xmath13 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ landauer ] ) . the transmissions @xmath1 are assumed to be energy independent .",
    "phase and energy relaxation may take place in these reservoirs but not inside the scatterer , i.e. the scatterer is assumed to be shorter than both dephasing and inelastic lengths .",
    "the scatterer region has an effective capacitance @xmath14 .",
    "for simplicity we will also assume that the charging energy @xmath15 does not exceed the typical inverse traversal time .",
    "the scatterer is connected to the voltage source @xmath16 via linear external impedance @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a simple case @xmath18 .",
    "if necessary , generalization of our calculation to arbitrary @xmath19 can be performed in a straightforward manner .     and",
    "is connected to the voltage source @xmath16 via an impedance @xmath17.,width=288 ]    in what follows we will investigate the current noise and evaluate the correlation function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the current operator in the circuit of fig .",
    "1 . this correlator can be expressed in the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the noninteracting contribution to the current noise @xcite and @xmath24 is the correction due to electron - electron interactions inside the scatterer .",
    "this correction will be evaluated in the most interesting `` metallic '' limit @xmath25 here we introduced dimensionless conductances of the scatterer and the shunt , respectively @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( [ metal ] ) implies that at least one of these two dimensionless conductances is required to be much larger than unity .",
    "quite obviously , the latter correlator ( [ corr ] ) should depend on both @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we also introduce another correlator @xmath30 defined by the same eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) in which one should substitute the current operator across the scatterer @xmath31 .",
    "the two correlators @xmath32 and @xmath33 are not independent . with the aid of the current conservation condition and performing the fourier transformation with respect to @xmath34 ,",
    "one easily finds the relation @xmath35 where @xmath36 the second term is due the noise produced by the external resistor @xmath29 which has to be subtracted in order to arrive at @xmath37 .    in general",
    "also the correlator @xmath37 depends on both @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath38 the dependence on the shunt resistance is weak and can be neglected . in this case",
    "the interaction correction to the current noise spectrum @xmath39 depends only on the properties of the scatterer .",
    "below we will present our key results for @xmath39 only in this limit .",
    "more general expressions can be found in sec .",
    "3 .    let us define the average voltage across the scatterer @xmath40 and consider first the limit of relatively small voltages .",
    "at sufficiently large temperatures and/or frequencies we find @xmath41 these results apply as long as either temperature or frequency exceeds an exponentially small parameter @xmath42 . for even smaller frequencies and temperatures",
    "@xcite we get @xmath43 note that the above expressions could also be anticipated from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) combined with the results @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the limit of low voltages the current noise is described by the standard nyquist formula .",
    "hence , in order to satisfy fdt one should simply substitute the effective conductance ( [ univ ] ) into this formula . in this way one gets the interaction correction @xmath44 proportional to @xmath45 . for instance , in the low frequency limit one finds @xcite @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "combining these expressions with fdt one immediately reproduces eqs .",
    "( [ hight ] ) , ( [ intt ] ) and ( [ lowt ] ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that here we evaluate the current - current correlation functions directly and _ do not _ use the results @xcite together with fdt .",
    "however , it is satisfactory to observe that fdt is explicitly maintained in our calculation and the results derived here are fully consistent with those of ref . .",
    "now let us turn to the case of relatively large voltages @xmath52 where the shot noise becomes important .",
    "as it was already announced , in this case the correction to the noise power spectrum is proportional to the parameter @xmath53 in particular we obtain @xmath54 we note that this correction can be either negative or positive depending on the relation between the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , in contrast to the limit of low voltages ( nyquist noise ) , one _ can not _ conclude that shot noise is always reduced by interactions .",
    "this reduction occurs only for conductors with relatively low transmissions @xmath56 , while for systems with higher transmissions the net effect of the electron - electron interaction enhances the shot noise . in the important case of diffusive conductors",
    "one has @xmath57 , @xmath58 and , hence , @xmath59 in this case the shot noise is reduced by interactions .",
    "the above results have a transparent physical interpretation . at low voltages",
    "the power spectrum of the nyquist noise is proportional to the system conductance @xmath60 . since in the presence of interactions the conductance acquires a correction proportional to @xmath10 ,",
    "the interaction correction to the nyquist noise should scale with the same parameter ( [ landr ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "shot noise is determined by the combination @xmath61 .",
    "accordingly , the interaction correction to the shot noise power should consist of two contributions .",
    "one of them comes from @xmath62 and is again proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "another contribution originates from the interaction correction to @xmath63 which turns out to scale as @xmath64 . since these two corrections enter with the opposite signs we immediately arrive at the combination ( [ bg ] ) .",
    "we also point out that the third cumulant of the current operator for noninteracting electrons is known @xcite to be proportional to the parameters ( [ landr ] ) and ( [ bg ] ) respectively at low and high voltages .",
    "following the same arguments as above we can _ conjecture _ that the interaction correction to the third cumulant should scale as @xmath65 at low voltages , while in the limit of large voltages one can expect that this correction is governed by the combination @xmath66 , where @xmath67 this conjecture can also be generalized to higher cumulants of the current operator .",
    "we would like to emphasize that  although the above conjecture seems intuitively appealing ",
    "it should still be verified by means of a rigorous calculation which is beyond the scope of the present paper . in the next section",
    "we will concentrate on the current noise and will provide a detailed derivation of the results presented above .",
    "similarly to ref . we will use the effective action technique in order to evaluate the current - current correlator for the system depicted in fig .",
    "1 . it is convenient to introduce the quantum phase variable @xmath68 which is proportional to the integral of the fluctuating voltage ( see appendix a )",
    ". we will proceed within the keldysh formalism and introduce two phase variables @xmath69 related to the two branches of the keldysh contour . defining @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "one can denote the overall phase jumps across the scatterer as @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "correspondingly , the phase jumps across the ohmic shunt are @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
