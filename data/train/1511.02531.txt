    "according to bardeen s insight , conformal symmetry as a custodial symmetry can protect the higgs mass from large uv contributions @xcite , addressing the naturalness problem @xcite .",
    "such a possibility can be realized if the conformal symmetry is only softly broken and is restored sufficiently quickly , requiring the couplings to run to a fixed point at a high energy scale @xcite .",
    "moreover , the coleman  weinberg ( cw ) mechanism @xcite can dynamically generate natural scale hierarchies between the unification scale and the electroweak ( ew ) scale , through dimensional transmutation as in qcd @xcite . in this article",
    ", we make a connection between the fixed point required in the ( quantum ) conformal scenario and the notion of asymptotic safety ( as ) , which also requires a fixed point and was originally proposed to make the standard model ( sm ) and gravity valid up to arbitrarily high energy scales without any singularities @xcite .",
    "since there is no non - trivial fixed point within the sm , the requirement of a fixed point within the conformal scenario provides an excellent motivation for extending the sm .",
    "although different versions of the sm extensions with classical conformal symmetry have been proposed in the literature @xcite , none have incorporated as .    in this article , we implement the as principle in conformal hidden sector models and apply this formalism to the detailed example of a leptophobic @xmath5 model , and explore some phenomenological applications .",
    "this model is introduced in section ii .",
    "we regard asymptotic safety as providing deep motivation for the existing non - as flat scenarios proposed in @xcite , with an emphasis on the fixed points of the scalar couplings below the singularity to avoid landau poles and provide a stable higgs vacuum .",
    "we provide a categorization of different as scenarios according to the gravity contribution to the rg functions above planck scale .",
    "we use the rg equation as a bridge to connect the uv boundary conditions to ew / tev scale physics and explore implications for sm observables",
    ". the predictive power of as scenarios implies that most of the parameters in the model are uniquely determined , thereby providing interesting interrelationships among the couplings , the scale of the fixed point ( transition scale ) @xmath1 , and the generations of quarks coupled to the @xmath5 gauge field .",
    "furthermore , it is not necessary to associate the the transition scale @xmath1 with the planck scale ; indeed we find that @xmath1 is very sensitive to the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath3 , and for a fixed @xmath3 there exists an interesting range of values for @xmath1 .",
    "the details of the rg equation analysis are in section iii .",
    "section iv contains an application of these techniques to the potential diboson excess at the lhc @xcite .",
    "a diboson excess occurs naturally in the as scenarios we explore , although it does not always match the experimentally observed value .",
    "in addition , we find diboson excesses are also sensitive to @xmath3 and correlations among @xmath1 , @xmath3 and diboson excesses are provided .",
    "we find one of the as boundary conditions provides a diboson excess of around 4 fb , which is close to the current best fit value of 5 fb @xcite .",
    "this requires a top quark yukawa coupling @xmath6 which is consistent with current bounds ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and a transition scale @xmath7 , which is much lower than the planck scale . note that to avoid large threshold contributions to the higgs mass , we assume there is no extra - heavy particles at the transition scale @xmath1 .",
    "the model also admits the possibility of a dark sector that interacts with the @xmath5 gauge field through a purely vector coupling .",
    "we provide a brief discussion of the potential of this model to address the dark matter problem in section v. our results are summarized in section vi .",
    "we investigate the conformally symmetric complex singlet extension of the sm with an extra @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "the lagrangian of the scalar sector is written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath10 is the complex singlet and @xmath11 is the extended covariant derivative . in the basis where the two @xmath12 gauge kinetic terms are diagonal , the covariant derivative term is written as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the gauge couplings of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the @xmath20 hypercharge and the @xmath0 charge .",
    "we make explicit the mixing term proportional to @xmath23 that couples the @xmath24 field to sm hypercharge @xmath21 .",
    "dilepton constraints on new neutral gauge bosons are stringent , so we would like to avoid coupling the @xmath5 gauge group to sm leptons , making the model leptophobic . because we would like to focus on a leptophobic variant , we choose a special case of the gauge group @xmath25 where",
    "@xmath26 and the gauge group in our case can be denoted @xmath27 with charge @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "inclusion of a new gauge group generates a new set of perturbative anomalies . to cancel these anomalies , we include several particles charged under the new gauge group @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , we require a right handed neutrino @xmath29 and two ` spectator ' fermions @xmath30 and @xmath31 that are vectorlike under the sm gauge group .",
    "the neutrino also couples to the singlet field through a majorana yukawa - type term @xcite : @xmath32 .",
    "these spectator particles have no effect on the phenomenological conclusions .",
