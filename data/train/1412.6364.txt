    "all known families of exceptional op have a weight of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a classical op weight and where @xmath6 is a certain polynomial whose degree is equal to the number of gaps in the xop degree sequence , and which does nt vanish on the domain of orthogonality .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that the weight indeed takes the above form for every exceptional op family .",
    "the zeros of exceptional orthogonal polynomials are divided into two groups according to whether they lie in the domain of orthogonality .",

    "exceptional zeros_. for sufficiently high degree @xmath3 , the number of exceptional zeros is precisely equal to the degree of @xmath6 .",
