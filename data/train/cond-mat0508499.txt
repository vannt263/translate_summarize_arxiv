    "the thermodynamics and the dynamics of glass forming substances exhibit anomalous behaviors near the glass transition temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "as the sample which was prepared by rapid cooling below @xmath0 is heated , the specific heat exhibits an abrupt increment at @xmath0@xcite .",
    "it is also known that supercooled liquids near @xmath0 show several relaxation processes and that the relaxation time of the slowest process tends to diverge at a temperature below @xmath0@xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to construct a theory for the glass transition which gives a unified explanation for these dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies .",
    "the mode coupling theory ( mct)@xcite for the glass transition describes the liquid dynamics based on the generalized langevin equation and predicts an ergodic - to - nonergodic transition at a critical temperature , @xmath1 due to the nonlinear coupling between various modes .",
    "however , it is now believed that @xmath1 is much higher than @xmath0 . in addition",
    ", mct can not treat the thermodynamic singularities .",
    "mezard and parisi estimated thermodynamic properties of glassy state in quasi - equilibrium with the replica method @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the kauzmann temperature , @xmath2 , becomes an ideal glass transition temperature .",
    "however , @xmath2 is much lower than @xmath0 and the replica method can not treat the dynamics either . both theories",
    "thus can not give a unified explanation for the thermodynamic and dynamic singularities of supercooled liquids near @xmath0 .",
    "we have proposed the free energy landscape picture by which a unified understanding is given for the singularities near @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the free energy landscape is defined in the configurational space as a function of fictitious localized atomic positions and each point in the free energy landscape is determined by coarse - graining of the microscopic motion in the configurational space .",
    "the free energy landscape is expected to have many basins and the saddle points at low temperatures .",
    "the separation of the dynamics can be understood by the separation of the dynamics among basins and the dynamics within a basin .",
    "the thermodynamic and dynamic singularities near @xmath0 can also be explained by the free energy landscape picture .",
    "the trapping diffusion model@xcite and its generalization to dynamics in a landscape@xcite provide a unified understanding of the dynamical singularities near the glass transition .",
    "this model showed that the dynamical transition occurs at the temperature where the mean waiting time for escaping from a basin diverges .",
    "tao et al.@xcite proposed a model based on the free energy landscape picture to explain the specific heat anomaly at the glass transition .",
    "they showed that the anomaly of the specific heat occurs when the mean waiting time exceeds the observation time at low temperatures .",
    "it is now believed that the glass transition can be phenomenologically well explained by the free energy landscape picture .",
    "it is thus an important question how one can explicitly define and construct the landscape on the basis of the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "because of this lack of an explicit theory , the analysis of the dynamics in the landscape has been detered so far .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to define explicitly the free energy landscape using the microscopic hamiltonian . to this end",
    ", we exploit the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite .",
    "one of the key concepts to understand the glass transition singularity is the cooperatively rearranging region ( crr ) proposed by adam and gibbs@xcite .",
    "adam and gibbs succeeded in explaining the non - arrenius behavior in the temperature dependence of the viscosity for fragile glass forming liquids .",
    "however there is no clear common understanding of the physical meaning for the crr . from the present definition of the free energy landscape , the clear meaning of",
    "the crr emerges .",
    "in addition to the crr , the present construction of the landscape leads to a new concept of rearranging region , namely simultaneously rearranging region ( srr ) which is defined by the difference between the atomic configuration in two adjacent basins .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give a definition of the free energy landscape by the dft in sec 2 .",
    "to confirm the usefulness of this definition , we construct the free energy landscape for rearrangement of atoms in an fcc crystal of hard spheres in sec 3 .",
    "a relation between the free energy landscape and the crr is given in sec 4 .",
    "we also discuss the srr in sec .",
    "results are summarized in sec 5 .",
    "we define the free energy by the partition function which is obtained by the partial sum of the fast motion in the configurational space .",
    "the free energy becomes a function of the fictitious atomic positions and we call this free energy as the landscape .",

    "our definition of the crr is thought to be closely related to the idea of the crr by adam and gibbs@xcite , since the particles which are moved at the saddle point are thought to give the configurational entropy for the rearrangement proposed by adam and gibbs@xcite .",
