    "we also obtain a splitting formula for the scalar analytic torsion in terms of combinatorial torsion of a long exact sequence on cohomology , refining the result of y. lee in [ lee , theorem 1.7 ( 2 ) ] .",

    "this is done partly because the cheeger - mller theorem for manifolds with boundary and unimodular representations is not explicitly established for the time being .",
    "it seems , however , that the appropriate result can be established by an adaptation of arguments in [ l ] and [ mu ] .",
