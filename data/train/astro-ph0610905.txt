    "in the core - accretion model , gas - giant planets begin life as solid cores that grow by sweeping up small planetesimals @xcite .",
    "cores @xmath7 grow oligarchically : each radial zone in a protoplanetary disk contains a single core and many planetesimals @xcite .",
    "perturbations from a core control the orbital distribution of nearby planetesimals which then determines the core s growth rate .",
    "cores larger than mars acquire extended atmospheres of nebular gas . passing planetesimals are slowed by gas drag as a result , increasing the chance of capture @xcite .",
    "when a core reaches a critical mass @xmath8 , a static atmosphere can no longer be supported , and the core accretes a massive gas envelope , becoming a gas - giant planet @xcite .",
    "cores must grow to @xmath9 before the disk gas disperses , which typically happens in a few myr @xcite .",
    "a core of mass @xmath10 sweeps up planetesimals at a rate given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the core s orbital period and hill radius , and @xmath14 is the local surface density of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the collision probability @xmath15 depends on the relative velocity @xmath16 of passing planetesimals , which is a function of their mean eccentricity @xmath17 and inclination @xmath18 @xcite .    in the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) ,",
    "the solid and gas surface densities are : @xmath19 where @xmath20 g@xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath23 is the orbital radius ; @xmath24 is the surface density of rocky material at 5 au ; @xmath25 ; @xmath26 inside the snow line , and @xmath27 outside the snow line .",
    "most models for the formation of jupiter use mass - enhanced nebulae , with @xmath2825 g@xmath21 , in order to grow to @xmath9 before the gas disperses @xcite .",
    "a core generates spiral density waves in the gas which cause the core to undergo inward type - i migration at a rate given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the core s keplerian orbital velocity , @xmath31 is the gas sound speed , and @xmath32 is the stellar mass @xcite .",
    "( in this paper we consider only migration caused by the gaseous component of the disk ) .",
    "a @xmath33 core at 5 au in a mass - enhanced nebula will migrate into its star in 10,00030,000 years , much less than the time required to form a core in most models @xcite .",
    "growth and migration rates are both proportional to @xmath34 ( for a given disk metallicity ) , so this result is independent of the disk mass .",
    "a massive planet clears an annular gap in the disk and undergoes type - ii migration , moving inwards at the same rate that gas flows viscously towards the star : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the disk viscosity @xcite .",
    "observed disk accretion rates imply @xmath38 @xcite , so a planet at 5 au will migrate into its star in 0.5 myr .",
    "this is less than the lifetime of most disks @xcite .",
    "the existence of gas - giant planets suggests that : ( i ) giant - planet cores grow rapidly before type - i migration moves them into the star , and ( ii ) giant planets form at locations where the disk viscosity is lower than observed disk accretion rates would suggest",
    ".    core growth should be fastest when planetesimals are small for two reasons .",
    "small planetesimals experience strong gas drag , reducing @xmath17 and @xmath18 sufficiently for @xmath16 to be determined by keplerian shear in the disk @xcite . as a result , @xmath15 is much higher than in the dispersion - dominated regime considered by most models .",
    "in addition , small planetesimals are slowed when they pass through the atmospheres of large cores , increasing the capture probability @xcite .",
    "most previous models have considered planetesimals with radii @xmath39100 km @xcite .",
    "planetesimals would have this size if they formed via gravitational instabilities ( gi ) in the solid component of the disk @xcite .",
    "however , gi requires @xmath40 @xcite , which probably occurs under only limited circumstances .",
    "alternatively , planetesimals may form by pairwise coagulation of dust grains @xcite , but it is unclear how large these objects will be . regardless of the initial planetesimal size",
    ", @xmath3 probably becomes small once cores grow larger than ceres , due to collisional fragmentation @xcite .",
    "given these uncertainties , we will treat @xmath3 as a model parameter .",
    "we can gauge the importance of @xmath3 using a simple model for core growth based on equation  [ eq - dmdt ] .",
    "here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are determined assuming an equilibrium between excitation due to perturbations from nearby cores @xcite and damping due to gas drag @xcite .",
    "the core s capture cross section is calculated including the effect of its atmosphere using equations a7a12 of @xcite .",
    "core growth rates are assumed to be 50% higher than in equation  [ eq - dmdt ] due to collisions between neighbouring cores @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows the mass of a core growing at 5 au , neglecting migration , for 4 values of @xmath3 . here , @xmath41 g@xmath21 , solids have a density of 1.5 g@xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "core growth times are shorter when @xmath3 is small , as expected . when @xmath44 m , the core formation time is shorter than the type - i migration timescale , shown by the dashed line .",
    "dissipation of the nebular gas will slow type - i migration , and migration will speed up core growth by increasing the supply of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "hence , cores should survive when @xmath3 is somewhat larger than 100 m.    the source of viscosity in protoplanetary disks is unclear .",
    "one possibility is magneto - rotational instability @xcite , which is highly effective but probably confined mainly to the surface layers of a disk @xcite . near the midplane , where planets form , @xmath45 lower than in the surface layers @xcite , corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "similar values of @xmath46 can explain the size distribution of chondrules seen in meteorites @xcite .",

    ", the core opens a gap and type - ii migration begins .",
    "however , inward migration is offset by the angular momentum gained by absorbing smaller bodies that migrate into the core s vicinity .",
    "these collisions can be seen as jumps in the core s mass , shown in the lower panel of figure 2 .",
    "after 40,000 years , the core starts to acquire an envelope .",
    "envelope growth slows over time as @xmath73 decreases and @xmath10 increases , reducing accretion across the gap .",
    "a second core at 20 au undergoes rapid type - i migration , then opens a gap when @xmath81 au .",
    "this core acquires an envelope but its growth lags behind the body at 5 au .",
    "the core moves inwards by @xmath82 au due to type - ii migration , but migration slows when @xmath73 becomes small .",
    "a third core at 23 au grows and undergoes type - i migration , but remains too small to acquire an envelope before the gas disperses .",

    "most simulations generate radially ordered systems : 1 or 2 gas - giant planets with @xmath86 au , followed by 1 or 2 large cores containing little gas , and finally a disk of sub - earth - mass objects , akin to the kuiper belt .",
    "gas - giant planets produced in the model have solid - to - gas ratios similar to saturn but higher than jupiter .",
    "high solid fractions arise when the innermost planet absorbs other cores as they migrate inwards . in the model",
    ", closely spaced cores always coalesce .",
    "jupiter s low solid - to - gas ratio suggests it gravitationally scattered nearby cores rather than absorbing them . in most simulations ,",
    "several cores cross the disk s inner edge due to type - i migration .",
    "presumably such objects would be lost into the star .",
    "these bodies contain only a few earth masses and migrate rapidly , so their dynamical effect on nascent terrestrial planets is probably not severe .",
    "no planets are lost via type - ii migration unless @xmath87 .",
    "a gas giant migrating through the inner solar system would remove most of the solid material present .",
    "terrestrial planets that formed subsequently would contain mostly ice - rich material from the outer disk @xcite .",
    "the rocky compositions of the inner planets in the solar system suggest that no giant planets were lost this way and that @xmath46 was small .",
    "if @xmath88 at the disk midplane , type - ii migration times will be comparable to disk lifetimes . in a flared disk ,",
    "the migration rate is roughly independent of @xmath23 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq - type2 ] ) . hence",
    ", giant planets should be common everywhere between their formation location and the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the model predicts that this is the case .",
    "figure 4 shows the planets produced in 48 simulations with @xmath89 m and @xmath90 .",
    "giant planets are abundant at all distances from the inner edge of the disk out to 20 au .",
