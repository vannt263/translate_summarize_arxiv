    "in spite of its great experimental successes @xcite , the standard model ( sm ) of the electroweak interactions is still widely regarded as an incomplete theory .",
    "the reasons are manifold , including the existence of non - baryonic dark matter and non - zero neutrino masses in addition to the theoretical problems of triviality and naturalness related to the scalar higgs sector responsible for the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "there are many extensions of the sm that require the existence of color octet scalar particles , such as the extra component of the gluon field in models with extra dimensions @xcite or supersymmetric models with an adjoint chiral supermultiplet @xcite .",
    "the existence of color octet scalars have also been used to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . extended scalar sectors of the sm with color octet scalars that respect the principle of minimal flavor violation",
    "were also recently considered @xcite .",
    "color octet scalars may as well have important effects in the higgs boson production via gluon fusion @xcite .",
    "early studies on the existence of color octet scalars were done in the context of one - family technicolor models @xcite .",
    "both electroweak triplets ( @xmath0 ) and singlets ( @xmath1 , sometimes denoted also as technieta @xmath2 , a notation which we will adopt in this paper ) are present in the spectrum of the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) arising from the global @xmath3 spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the masses of the color octet pngb arise mainly from qcd contributions and are expected to be of the order of @xmath4 gev @xcite .",
    "the cross section for pair production of the color octet scalars is dominated by gluon fusion , which in turn is determined by gauge invariance @xcite and consequently , except for the gluon parton densities , is mostly model independent , being fixed by the masses of the particles .",
    "there could also be a model dependent enhancement due to the coupling of the scalars to color - octet vector resonances such as a technirho @xmath5 @xcite , which in turn couples to quarks and gluons .",
    "however , as shown by two of the present authors @xcite , a proper gauge invariant treatment of the @xmath5 results in a vanishing @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath6 coupling @xcite . hence , only the quark initial state can cause this enhancement .",
    "while models of a strongly interacting sector responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking fell in disfavor in the mid nineties due to tight bounds from electroweak precision measurements , they have experienced a recent resurrection due to the correspondence with weakly interacting models in extra dimensions @xcite . in this case , the @xmath5 could be interpreted as the kaluza - klein excitation of the gluon .",
    "pair production of color octet scalars at the lhc have been recently analyzed @xcite .",
    "their detection was discussed using the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels @xcite for a scalar mass of the order of a tev ( a recent analysis using a generic four - jet channel at the tevatron is discussed in @xcite ) . however , the low mass values suggested by technicolor models , typically below the @xmath10 threshold , can be more challenging to observe .",
    "we find it timely to extend the work done previously in @xcite , where rarer decay modes of the color octet ( pseudo)scalar are used , namely decays induced by the chiral anomaly into massless gauge bosons ( photons and gluons ) , to investigate the possibility of detecting these new states at the lhc .    in section",
    "ii we describe the details of our model , in particular the description of @xmath2 pair production and decay . in section iii we present the details and results of our simulations of @xmath2 pairs , produced in @xmath11 collisions at lhc energies and detected as @xmath12jet events ; we include a study of the background and the cuts required for a statistically significant signal .",
    "finally in section iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "when introducing massive vector bosons in a theory that contain gauge fields , care must be taken not to spoil the gauge symmetry . in our case , we need to describe qcd with the addition of color - octet vector bosons . following the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce two massive vector fields , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , each transforming as an octet under their respective @xmath15 and @xmath16 symmetry group , with a mixing term which is fixed in such a way that the resulting mass matrix has a zero eigenvalue .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector is identified with the physical gluon field .",
    "the orthogonal combination is identified with the physical color octet vector resonance @xmath5 .",
    "the physical @xmath17 gauge symmetry is the linear combination of the generators of @xmath15 and @xmath16 corresponding to the massless gluon .",
    "the color octet pseudoscalar @xmath2 is introduced as a matter field that transforms purely under gauged-@xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , quarks are introduced in the fundamental representation of the gauged-@xmath15 symmetry .",
    "hence , in the mass eigenbasis there is a direct coupling of quarks to the physical color octet resonance @xmath5 .    at this point",
    "the free parameters of the model can be taken as the masses of the color octet vector and scalar particles , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and a coupling constant @xmath20 that controls the strong interaction decay of the technirho into technietas , @xmath21 .",
    "one extra parameter , the pngb decay constant @xmath22 is necessary to describe the possible @xmath2 decays .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath23 decay is given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the gell - mann @xmath26 matrices .",
    "the color octet technieta couples to gauge bosons through the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly with an amplitude given by @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the polarization vector and momentum of the vector boson @xmath30 . for the cases we are interested",
    "one has : @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of technicolors , which we take as @xmath34 for definiteness .",
    "hence , our model is completely determined by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 . in the next section",
    "we perform a realistic simulation of the possibility to detect a pair of color octet technietas produced in the process @xmath35 at the lhc .",
    "the model was implemented in comphep @xciteusing lanhep @xcite .",
    "we used comphep for generating events for the double technieta production .",
    "subsequently , they were processed by a fortran code we wrote in order to generate the @xmath2 decay products .",
    "all the simulations were done for @xmath36 gev .",
    "we restricted ourselves to consider only @xmath19 below the top quark threshold because above that point the technieta width is strongly depend on the existence of a topcolor interaction .",
    "we considered two sources of standard model background : the production of a photon and three jets and the production of four jets with the possibility that a jet can be misinterpreted as a photon .",
    "we assume that the probability of such misidentification occurs is about @xmath37 .",
    "the background was generated using madgraph / madevent with cteq5l as parton distribution function .",
    "we considered gluons and all the ( anti-)quarks of the first two generations in the initial state and as sources of jets .",
    "all the possible tree level partonic subprocesses were taken into account in the calculation of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    in order to introduce some degree of realism in our calculations",
    ", we took into account the smearing of the final momenta .",
    "we used the following parametrization for the detector resolution :    @xmath40    in fact , it is expected that the resolution of atlas will be better than what we used and in that sense our estimate must be taken as conservative .",
    "the reconstruction of the technieta was done by studying the photon - jet invariant mass ( @xmath41 ) and the two jet invariant mass ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we addressed the combinatorics problem by taking the @xmath41 closer to @xmath43 as a `` technieta candidate '' .",
    "the background was reduced imposing the following set of kinematical cuts :    @xmath44    in figure [ fig : thefigure ] , we show the reconstructed technieta mass obtained by summing up the @xmath41 and @xmath42 distributions after the cuts were applied .",
    "the dashed line represents the direct background while the double - dotted - dashed line is the result obtained when a jet is misidentified as a photon .",
    "our signal is shown by the dotted - dashed line .",
    "assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath45 fb@xmath46 , we expect to observe about 21400 events with 4200 of them corresponding to our signal .",
    "that would correspond to a deviation from the sm with a statistical significance of 32@xmath47 .        in this analysis",
    ", we have used some cuts that depend on the technieta mass .",
    "this procedure may be uncomfortable from the experimental point of view since the mass of the searched particle is not known a priori and the whole possible range must be scanned .",
    "fortunately , in our case the mass interval is limited because , due to qcd contributions , the technieta can not be lighter than 300 gev and we do not expect that the channel considered in this work to be useful for discovery if the technieta is heavier than 350 gev .",
    "however , it is possible to devise a search strategy which is independent of the technieta mass . consider the following set of cuts :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the angle formed by a photon and a jet .",
    "the last cut comes from the fact that the technieta is a spin 0 particle and it decays isotropic in its rest system , while the background tends to have peaks at @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ fig : themasslessfigure ] shows the invariant mass distribution obtained with the new set of cuts .",
    "we expect to observe , integrating over the whole mass range , 12600 background events and 1100 events coming from the technietas with @xmath45 fb@xmath46 , corresponding to a @xmath51 signal .",
    "we studied the pair production and detection of color - octet pseudoscalar bosons at the lhc , which could be present in models of electroweak symmetry breaking induced by new strong interactions .",
    "we restricted our analysis to @xmath52 ( the color - octet pseudoscalar mass ) below @xmath53 , in which case the decay into @xmath54-@xmath55 is forbidden and consequently the detection is more challenging . in such cases , the color - octet pseudoscalar decays mainly into two gluons , induced by the anomaly , while the direct decay into @xmath56-@xmath57 has a fraction less than 20% .",
    "we perform simulations for the production and decay of pseudoscalar pairs , including background .",
    "we did not look for the dominant 4-jet mode , but for the suppressed 3-jet + photon mode , which has a much lower background .",
    "we used two different methods of analysis . in one method",
    "we assume @xmath52 to be known in our cuts , and obtain a number of events 32@xmath47 above the expected background , for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath46 . in our second method",
    ", we did not include any value of @xmath52 in our cuts , but relied only on the invariant mass reconstruction of the two decaying pseudoscalars , in which case the number of events resulted in a statistical significance of 10@xmath47 above the expected background .",
    "these results show that the lhc has the potential to detect or exclude the existence of such pseudoscalar colored bosons .",
