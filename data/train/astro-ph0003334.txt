    "starburst galaxies constitute an important class of extragalactic objects . they contribute a significant fraction of the total high - mass star formation in the local universe ( _ e.g. _ soifer _ et al .",

    "1982 ; kennicutt _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ; telesco , wolstencroft & done 1988 ; joseph 1990 ) further emphasizes the importance of starbursts in galaxy evolution .    despite the obvious importance of starbursts , a canvas of recent starburst galaxy studies",
    "suggests that a full `` prescription '' for these events has yet to be written .",
    "discrepancies exist even for the most massive stars formed , which represent the largest energy contributions .",
    "for instance , it has been suggested by some authors that the production of the highest mass stars may be suppressed in starburst galaxies , based on low measured values of diagnostic line ratios such as he i ( 2.06@xmath0m)/ hi(br@xmath5 ) and [ ne ii]/[ar iii ] detected in well - known starburst sources .",
    "these results have been interpreted as possibly indicating severe upper mass cutoffs to the initial mass function ( imf ) , some as low as @xmath125 - 30@xmath2  ( _ e.g. _ puxley _ et al .",

    "a lack of massive stars in starbursts is difficult to reconcile with a growing body of evidence for the formation of very massive stars in nearby regions of active star - formation . in recent studies of local high - mass star - forming regions at both high and low metallicity ,",
    "stars up to at least 100  @xmath2  are observed ; these regions include the galactic center ( e.g. krabbe _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; najarro _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; serabyn , shupe , & figer 1998 ; figer _ et al .",

    "_ 1998 ) , and the r136 cluster at the center of 30 doradus ( e.g. hunter _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , massey & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "there is also a growing body of indirect evidence for the presence of very massive stars in starbursts .",
    "_ hst _ optical imaging has revealed the presence of young compact `` super star clusters '' in several nearby starburst galaxies , including m82 ( oconnell _ et al .",

    "these super star clusters have extreme luminosities , and in some cases bright emission features characteristic of wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. , he ii 4696  emission ) ; such properties are difficult to explain without a large contribution from very massive stars ( m@xmath660@xmath2 ; see e.g. , gonzalez delgado _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; schaerer _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "several authors have recently argued that observed low - excitation nebular line ratios in starbursts may be due to aging effects rather than a severe upper mass cutoff ( _ e.g. _ rieke _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; genzel , hollenbach , & townes 1994 ; achtermann & lacy 1995 ; satyapal _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; engelbracht _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; see also vanzi & rieke 1997 ) .",
    "studying a sufficiently large sample of starbursts is therefore valuable in breaking the degeneracy between age and upper mass cutoff .",
    "as we are not likely to catch all starbursts at a `` late '' age , and the ultraviolet , optical , and far - infrared luminosities decline with time after the peak star formation activity , we can determine the relative importance of variations in star formation parameters and aging effects by studying a larger sample .",
    "in this work , we present results of a starburst modeling program to interpret mid - infrared ( mir ) spectroscopy from the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ; de graauw _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) aboard the infrared space observatory ( iso ; kessler _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . to this end , we have gathered atomic fine structure line fluxes ( in particular for the [ ne  ii ] 12.8@xmath0 m and [ ne  iii ] 15.6@xmath0 m lines ) for 27 starburst galaxies .",
    "this project is ideally suited for investigating the properties of the high - mass stellar population in heavily obscured star - forming regions of starburst galaxies , since the extinction at mir wavelengths is only a few percent of the optical extinction .",
    "this investigation thus constitutes an important contribution to the understanding of star formation in starburst systems , a field that has been dominated by studies in the optical and ultraviolet regimes in the intervening years between the iras and iso missions . as recent studies of the cosmic infrared background suggest a significant contribution from dusty starburst systems ( e.g. , puget _ et al .",

    "_ 1998 ; hauser _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; elbaz _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , the understanding of dusty starbursts is important in defining the picture of the most powerful star - forming events in the universe .",
    "we present the sample data in  [ sdata ] .",
    "we outline our modeling procedure and compare our iso - sws observations with model predictions in  [ smodels ] .",
    "we examine additional constraints on this starburst modeling study and examine the robustness of the modeling analysis in  [ sanalysis ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of our findings and summarize this work in  [ ssummary ] .",
    "the database for this project was created by combining data from the mpe guaranteed - time program on bright galactic nuclei ( 15 objects ) and an open - time observing proposal ( 12 objects ) , resulting in an iso - sws spectroscopic dataset for a total sample of 27 galaxies .",
    "the objects from the guaranteed - time program are all well - studied , infrared - bright starburst galaxies , and the open - time sample objects were selected on the basis of their 60@xmath0 m  flux densities ( s@xmath7 @xmath820  jy ) and their observability by iso in the last few months of the mission .    within these programs , we have targeted observations at a specific set of spectral lines , particularly the [ ne  ii ] 12.8@xmath0 m  and [ ne  iii ] 15.6@xmath0 m  fine structure lines ; in this work we will concentrate on the ratio of these two lines as a tracer of the massive star population , with additional lines introduced to constrain metallicities and gas densities .",
    "the neutral ne atom and the @xmath9 ion have ionization potentials of 21.56 ev and 40.95 ev respectively , making the [ ] / [ ] line ratio very sensitive to the spectral shape of the uv radiation field and thus to the properties of the most massive stars present .",
    "this information can be used to provide constraints on various star formation parameters , including the upper mass cutoff of the imf and the age and duration of the starburst ( see kunze _",
    "_ 1996 and rigopoulou _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 for earlier models using this and other mir line ratios ) .",
    "we have chosen the neon line ratio as the focus of this larger study , both for its sensitivity to massive , hot stars as well as the minimal uncertainties introduced in constructing the ratio of these two lines from iso - sws observations .",
    "the [ ] and [ ] lines span a wider range in ionization potential than other line ratios in this wavelength region , such as [ ] ( 10.5@xmath0m)/[](12.8@xmath0 m ) , [ ] /[](9.0@xmath0 m ) , [ ] /[](e.g . , achtermann & lacy 1995 ; beck , kelly , & lacy 1997 ; engelbracht _ et al .",

    ", kunze _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; rigopoulou _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . in addition , the [ ] / [ ] ratio has inherent uncertainties due to the determination of metallicities , and all of the alternatives listed above are subject to corrections for aperture size variations and/or systematic uncertainties due to measurements in different iso - sws bandpasses .",
    "systematic effects are minimized for the neon lines because they were observed with the same iso aperture and bandpass .",
    "in addition , because the wavelengths of the two mir neon lines are close , extinction effects can be neglected .",
    "for example , for a dust distribution in m82 which is well mixed with the stars and obeys a standard extinction law ( e.g. draine 1989 ) with a@xmath1050 mag ( mcleod _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ; schreiber 1999 ) , the observed line ratio is higher than the intrinsic line ratio by only a few percent .",
    "the same is true in the ultraluminous galaxy arp 220 for a uniform foreground dust screen providing a@xmath1050 mag for the starburst emission ( sturm _ et al .",
    "by contrast , extinction corrections can change line ratios such as [ ] / [ ] and [ ] / [ ] by 30 - 60% in similar conditions .",
    "furthermore , the [ ] and [ ] lines lie in the same spectral region as a broad silicate absorption feature at 9.8@xmath0 m , further complicating the measurement of line fluxes .",
    "the majority of the data described herein was taken in grating line scan mode sws02 , with data from some galaxies taken from full - grating - scan sws01 observations .",
    "data reduction was completed using the iso sws interactive analysis ( ia ) package , which includes interactive tools for dark current subtraction , flat fielding , and removal of fringing caused by interference within the detectors themselves ( see e.g. , schaeidt _ et al .",
    "the reduction completed    for this paper used post - mission calibration files ( june 1998 ) .",
    "line fluxes were determined by integration over the observed line profiles , which were generally close to gaussian in shape .",
    "the systematic calibration of line fluxes has an uncertainty of @xmath1130% ( schaeidt _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , though the effect of this uncertainty is minimized by comparing two lines from the same bandpass .",
    "the uncertainties in the measured fluxes range from  @xmath1110% for strong line sources to 30 - 40% for weaker sources ( generally from the open - time proposal ) . for comparison with models (  [ sanalysis ] )",
    ", we will assume uncertainties in the line ratios for the entire sample to be @xmath1250% .",
    "the aperture size for the bandpass containing the [ ne  ii ] and [ ne  iii ] lines is 14  x  27 . because of the weak sensitivity of this line ratio to extinction , no corrections for extinction were made ( though see  [ ssparams ] for other effects of dust ) .",
    "table [ tlines ] lists the mir neon line strengths for the galaxy sample .",
    "figure [ flines ] shows the corresponding neon line spectra , and figure [ flirvsratio ] shows the range of observed [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] ratios as a function of the infrared luminosity .",
    "the infrared luminosity @xmath13 is computed from the _ iras _ flux densities following the prescription of sanders & mirabel ( 1996 , their table 1 ) : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the flux density in jy in the band centered at wavelength @xmath16 . for several of the galaxies ,",
    "the sizes of the emission regions exceed the sws field of view , so we have applied a aperture - size correction to @xmath17 based on the spatial distribution of mir or radio continuum emission , millimetric co emission , or near - infrared hydrogen recombination line emission from the literature , assuming they all trace the same emission regions as the mir neon lines . for eight galaxies , the observed @xmath13",
    "was multiplied by a factor less than 0.5 to correct for the smaller sws field of view , and for two galaxies there was insufficient data to determine an aperture - size correction . for the remaining galaxies , 11 required no correction , and seven galaxies",
    "were corrected by factors between 0.5 and 1.0 .    in general , all of the sample objects have neon ratios between 0.05 and 1.0 ; however , the low - metallicity systems ngc  5253 and iizw40 have neon ratios of 3.5 and 12 , respectively . in  [ ssparams ] , we discuss the effects of metallicity on model line ratios , in order to address the observed range of emission properties for the entire sample .",
    "the sample presented in this paper includes nine objects for which [ ne ii ] line fluxes were measured by roche _",
    "( 1991 ) , who took observations from the ground in the 8 - 13@xmath0 m  atmospheric window .",
    "it is difficult to compare the fluxes derived from these two sets of observations due to differences in aperture size and the uncertain contribution of the broad 12.7@xmath0 m  pah feature at the end of the 8 - 13@xmath0 m  band .",
    "this is particularly true for galaxies such as m82 which exhibit strong pah features ( e.g. , roche _",
    "_ 1991 ; sturm _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) ; in the case of m82 , we estimate from the sws data that the broad 12.7@xmath0 m  feature could contribute a factor of 50% more flux to the apparent [ ne  ii ] line at the resolution observed by roche _",
    "et al . _ .",
    "in addition , for some objects in the roche _ et al . _ sample the [ ne ii ] line is redshifted out of the 8 - 13@xmath0 m  wavelength range and so can not be measured from the ground . however , for the 7 objects for which comparisons could be made , the line fluxes are consistent to within these rather large uncertainties .",
    "ngc  5253 and iizw40 were also singled out by roche _",
    "( 1991 ) as displaying high - excitation spectra , though the [ ne ii ] line was not detected .",
    "_ noted that these galaxies had little emission from broad pah features , which is consistent with high excitation and uv energy density in a low - metallicity environment ( see also vigroux 1997 ; thuan _ et al . _  1999",
    "; and madden 2000 ) .",
    "for further comparison , we include in figure [ flirvsratio ] the neon ratios for similar observations of w51 , 30 doradus , and the central parsec of the galaxy .",
    "the neon ratios for w51 and 30 doradus are higher than for the starburst galaxy sample , while that for the galactic center is lower ( a further discussion of the galactic center can be found in  [ ssgc ] ) .",
    "our iso - sws data thus generally confirm findings from nir and mir spectroscopy that powerful dusty starbursts exhibit low nebular excitation in comparison to galactic hii regions ( e.g. , doherty _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; cox _ et al .",
    "however , we find a range of values , with the most excited regions having neon ratios similar to those of young , galactic hii regions .",
    "the starburst modeling method presented here predicts mir spectral line ratios for evolving stellar clusters .",
    "observations of nearby starburst galaxies reveal that starburst regions are in fact composed of many individual units .",
    "in addition to the hst detections of super star clusters in starburst galaxies , bright compact sources seen in high - resolution near - infrared broad - band images have been interpreted as young clusters of red supergiants ( _ e.g. _ tacconi - garman , sternberg & eckart 1996 ; satyapal _ et al .",

    ", we present a set of models in which the starburst region is composed of a heterogeneous ensemble of recently - formed star clusters .",
    "therefore , we first lay the groundwork of modeling the emission from the hii region around stellar clusters .",
    "we have used the evolutionary synthesis code stars ( sternberg 1998 ) to model the integrated properties of individual stellar clusters .",

    "the integrated sed is obtained by summing over the contributions of all stars present .",
    "the sed assigned to each location in the @xmath18 diagram is taken from a hybrid grid created from two separate libraries , in order to best represent the properties of all stars .",
    "for very hot stars , the effects of line blanketing and blocking in rapidly expanding atmospheres are not well represented by lte models ; thus for stars with temperatures above 25,000  k ( m@xmath22 13@xmath2 ) , we have used new , non - lte seds by pauldrach _ et al . _",

    "the investigation of m82 by schreiber ( 1999 ) further shows that the effective ionization parameter is essentially independent of the location and the size of the regions studied , from individual burst sites @xmath49 in radius to the entire starburst core extending over @xmath50 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the regions of intense starburst activity in m82 , which dominate the nebular line emission , have very similar properties over a wide range of physical sizes . on average , the nebular conditions of the gas in the starburst regions of m82",
    "can thus be described locally and globally with the same parameters .",
    "a similar analysis is possible for the entire starburst regions of ngc3256 and ngc253 . by combining published data on the integrated lyman continuum luminosity from rigopoulou _ et al . _",

    "the computations are stopped when @xmath58 becomes smaller than @xmath59 ; at this point , the sfr has dropped down by several orders of magnitude compared to the initial sfr , and the stellar population produced by the starburst is expected to have faded away into the galaxy s background population .    with the nebular parameters determined above as constraints , the seds produced by stars are input into cloudy .",
    "approximating a thin shell around the distributed cluster geometry , cloudy was run with plane - parallel geometry and an ionization parameter specified by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "models for the burst timescales presented in this paper were computed by convolving the neon fluxes for the @xmath21=1 myr burst with an exponential sfr with the appropriate value of @xmath21 ,    @xmath60    where f@xmath61 is the flux in the line at wavelength @xmath16 .",
    "this method inherently assumes that u(@xmath20 ) is proportional to the ionizing photon rate produced in the 1 myr - timescale burst , rather than that indicated by the integrated q@xmath56 for the longer burst timescales .",
    "thus at later times , the [ ne iii]/[ne ii ] ratio will stay constant , as the line emission will be produced only by the most recently formed clusters .",
    "it is these recently - formed clusters which will dominate the ionizing radiation field at all ages , and are all assumed to have the same @xmath62 .      the model neon line ratios output by cloudy",

    "there is a slight decline in the computed ratio for @xmath20@xmath15  myr for the longest timescales , due to a build up of evolved clusters that soften the shape of the integrated ionizing radiation field .",
    "however , these evolved clusters must still be relatively young to affect the integrated ratio significantly .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the curves for timescales longer than @xmath67 can be attributed mainly to our choice of an exponentially decaying sfr , but also reflects the dominance of the youngest generations , for which @xmath52 is close to the maximum .    the vertical bar to the right of the plot represents the range of observed neon line ratios for all sample galaxies except the two low - metallicity blue dwarf galaxies ngc 5253 and iizw40 , which will be discussed separately in  [ ssparams ] . from the comparison with models , values of @xmath68 @xmath69",
    "can be ruled out for the entire sample .",
    "in addition , the largest neon ratios in the sample are consistent with upper mass cutoffs _ at least as large _ as @xmath70 , independent of the burst age and timescale .",
    "figure [ fsbmods ] shows clearly the degeneracy between age and @xmath27 : the range of observed neon ratios may either be due to true variations in the population of the most massive stars , or to short bursts of star formation where @xmath27  is always large but the sed is softened through aging . however , a similar modeling analysis of the nearby star formation sources plotted in figure [ flines ] ( thornley _ et al .",

    "these studies show that the number distribution of clusters in optical light and in ionizing luminosity follows a power - law lf , @xmath71 , with remarkably similar indexes in the range @xmath72 , down to the faintest luminosities observed .",
    "the typical completeness limits correspond to an absolute @xmath73-band magnitude of @xmath74 or to a lyman continuum luminosity of @xmath75 . hence only bright clusters are directly observed . for comparison ,",

    ", we must include the contribution from all clusters in a model starburst event .",
    "while this calculation is relatively straightforward in large , luminous clusters , it is more uncertain in lower - mass clusters where statistical fluctuations at the high - mass end of the imf become important : for instance , the formation of a single 20@xmath2   star instead of a single 15@xmath2   star could change the cluster luminosity by an order of magnitude . to determine the shape of the lf consistently for the brightest clusters as well as clusters fainter than @xmath110@xmath78  s@xmath79 , we ran a monte carlo simulation to determine the stellar contents of clusters of different masses using poisson statistics .",
    "our monte carlo simulation was run for a sample of 2x10@xmath80 clusters , with the number of stars per cluster ranging from 100 to 10@xmath81 and mass bins populated from @xmath82=0.1@xmath2  upward in accordance with the specified salpeter imf . in this way ,",
    "the upper mass cutoff of an individual cluster is dependent on both the total mass of the cluster and statistical variations in the population of the imf .",

    "the evolution of the lf with burst age for the ensemble of clusters is obtained by following the evolution of q@xmath84 for the clusters in each luminosity bin . for this purpose , we computed a library of cluster models for a @xmath21=1 myr burst using stars and cloudy .",
    "the monte carlo simulations described above provide the relation between q@xmath99 and @xmath100 , the mass of the most massive star in an individual cluster given a fixed imf and an input stellar count ( note that @xmath100 should be distinguished from an intrinsic , galaxy - wide upper mass cutoff of the imf , which we have thus far designated as @xmath27 ) .",
    "models were generated for @xmath21=1  myr and @xmath101=5 - 100  @xmath102 , in steps of @xmath103 .",
    "the range of q@xmath84 was divided in logarithmic bins of @xmath104q@xmath84 ) = 0.05  dex , and the models for intermediate @xmath100 were obtained by interpolation of the library models . at zero age , the clusters with different initial @xmath105 ( and q@xmath84 ) were distributed in the luminosity bins according to the lf . as the burst age increases ,",
    "the evolution of each cluster in q@xmath84 is followed ( using the library models ) , and the new lf at each time step is determined from the distribution of the clusters in the different q@xmath84 bins after evolution has taken place .",
    "the slope of the high - luminosity end of the lf ( @xmath106 ) changes very little during this evolution ; this is mainly due to the fact that these clusters contain stars with masses @xmath850@xmath2 .",
    "all such massive stars have similarly short main - sequence lifetimes ( _ e.g. _ schaller _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) , which implies that these luminous clusters move into lower q@xmath84 bins at similar rates .",
    "the constant slope of the high - luminosity end of the lf is thus consistent with the observed lf in various sources , which have presumably a range of ages and starburst histories .",
    "the neon ratio at any given age for the @xmath21=1  myr ensemble of clusters was obtained by summing over the [ ne  ii ] and [ ne  iii ] line fluxes of all the model clusters still contributing ; the integrated properties for longer burst timescales were again obtained by convolving those for the @xmath21=1 myr burst .",
    "the neon ratios predicted for an ensemble of clusters distributed according to the derived cluster lf are indicated , for the longest and shortest timescales we explored , by the dashed lines in the upper panel of figure [ fsbmods ] . as expected , the main effect of accounting for a cluster size distribution is that the smaller , less luminous clusters soften the integrated ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "in particular , the predicted [ ] / [ ] for an ensemble of clusters is lower than for a single cluster , assuming the same galaxy - wide @xmath27 .",
    "the effect of the lf is larger for higher @xmath27 , with a reduction in predicted ratios by a factor of @xmath12 for a galaxy - wide @xmath27=100  @xmath102 , and @xmath11.2 for @xmath27=25  @xmath107 .",
    "this dependence on @xmath27  reflects primarily the stellar properties themselves : the hardness of the ionizing spectrum decreases steeply as the stellar mass decreases .",
    "the magnitude of the effect of incorporating a cluster lf depends mainly on the power - law index for the lf and on the upper limit in q@xmath108 .",
    "the steep power - law we have adopted maximizes the differences between single and ensemble cluster models , in comparison with other plausible lfs with indices above the break of @xmath72 .",
    "the choice of a high upper limit in q@xmath108 is justified by observations in some starburst galaxies , notably ngc4038/4039 and m82 ( whitmore & schweizer 1995 ; oconnell _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) .",
    "although the `` down - weighting '' effects of the smaller clusters , which produce softer ionizing radiation , are measurable , they do not require a significantly different conclusion than that reached by comparison of our data with models of homogeneous clusters .",
    "accounting for a lf of the ionizing clusters which excite the observed nebular emission lines , we confirm that very high - mass stars can form in starburst galaxies , allowing @xmath109 even more easily in the sources with the highest measured ratios .",
    "if we posit that all starbursts form stars in the manner that nearby , massive star forming regions do , then the most plausible explanation for low observed line ratios is that starbursts are events of short duration ( figure [ fsbmods ] suggests @xmath21@xmath11  myr ) which produce very massive stars , but whose aging rapidly softens diagnostic ratios such as the ones we use here .",
    "our models show that as long as very massive stars are formed , even in small numbers , they strongly dominate the ionizing radiation field and thus maintain high neon line ratios .",
    "the ratios can only decrease to the observed range long enough after the exhaustion of starburst activity for the most massive stars to have evolved off the main sequence . for ratios near 0.1 , corresponding to stars with initial masses near @xmath111",
    ", this will take about 5  myr . in principle",
    ", the neon ratios will start declining very rapidly after the last massive stars have formed in the burst , so that the neon ratio alone does not fully constrain the timescale .",
    "however , by combining with other measurements which are indicative of starburst properties , we can explore the robustness of our conclusion that starburst timescales are generally quite short .",
    "the ratio of the bolometric to lyman continuum luminosities ( @xmath112/@xmath113 ) is a useful contrasting probe of the properties of massive stars : since this ratio is sensitive to a somewhat lower mass range than that to which [ ] 15.6@xmath114/[]12.8@xmath114  is sensitive , it varies significantly with time even for longer burst timescales .",
    "this reflects the buildup of a population of stars in a lower mass range which contribute more to @xmath112 , and which have longer main - sequence lifetimes .",
    "therefore , the combination of both diagnostics can help address the degeneracy between aging effects and variations in the upper mass cutoff .    as we are characterizing the properties of massive star forming regions , we assume @xmath115 ( as defined in  [ ssobs ] )",
    "this is usually a good approximation since a large fraction of the energy output of ob stars is absorbed by the surrounding interstellar dust , present in large amounts in starbursts , and re - emitted in the thermal infrared .",
    "we derived l@xmath56 using two different methods .",
    "first , we use measurements of hydrogen recombination line fluxes and thermal radio continuum emission , when such data were available from observations with the sws and in the literature . this allowed us to constrain simultaneously the extinction toward the sources from the comparison of observed and theoretical relative line fluxes .",
    "second , we used our own neon line fluxes corrected for extinction and assuming all neon atoms are either singly- or doubly - ionized .",
    "we assumed case b recombination coefficients and line emissivities ( hummer & storey 1987 ) , with an electron density of @xmath116 and temperature of @xmath117 , except when individual determinations were available in the literature . for the extinction correction , we adopted a composite extinction law made up of the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) law for @xmath118 0.9@xmath0 m   and the draine ( 1989 ) law for 0.9@xmath0m@xmath11940@xmath0 m .",
    "the effects of obscuration were neglected for @xmath120 40@xmath0 m . if sufficient data were available , we constrained the geometry of the emission sources and obscuring dust as well .",
    "two models were considered : a uniform foreground screen ( ufs ) of dust and a homogeneous mixture of dust and sources ( mix ) .",
    "otherwise , we considered only the ufs model .",
    "for the sources for which the determination from recombination lines was possible , the estimates from the hydrogen and neon lines agree to within a factor of three or better , and we adopted the average as the final l@xmath56 .",
    "the cases where the extinction could not be reliably constrained yield lower limits on l@xmath56 , and thus upper limits on l@xmath121/l@xmath56 .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fsbmods ] shows the models for l@xmath121/l@xmath56 obtained with stars . as in the upper panel ,",
    "the ratios expected for a homogeneous cluster population are shown as solid lines and those expected for a cluster ensemble defined by our lf are shown as dashed lines .",
    "the effect of including a cluster lf is of similar magnitude for @xmath13/@xmath113   as for the neon ratio .",
    "it is clear that the average neon and @xmath13/@xmath113  ratios are consistent with conditions where the clusters have high upper mass cutoffs , @xmath122 , and short burst timescales of a few million to @xmath110@xmath4 years . in fact , by plotting the neon ratios against the @xmath13/@xmath113  ratios in figure [ fsbmodsllyc ] , we see that the models suggest very short timescales , so short as to be difficult to produce even with the @xmath21=1 myr burst , the burst with the shortest timescale considered in this study . though this discrepancy is model - dependent , it is generally clear that short timescales are needed to reproduce the range of ratios observed in our starburst sample .",
    "the short timescales and ages inferred for the star forming activity in starburst galaxies are reminiscent of the ones in the young stellar clusters in the central parsec of our galaxy , and can be checked there on the basis of the existing stellar census .",
    "the observed [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is even lower than in most starbursts , despite the high ionization parameter log u = @xmath123 derived for the spatially resolved ionized region ( @xmath124  1  pc , lutz _",
    "the picture of a short but aged burst is supported by the direct stellar census @xcite which suggests a star formation event of age @xmath17 myr and duration approximately 4  myr .",
    "this event is most directly indicated by the presence of both cool red supergiants like irs7 and massive , moderately hot ( 20,000 to 30,000  k ) blue helium - rich supergiants or wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "we have computed models optimized for this galactic center region , assuming a single cluster with a salpeter imf , @xmath21=1  myr , @xmath27=100 , solar metallicity , and fixed log  u=@xmath123 , n=3000  @xmath64 as derived by lutz _ et al . _",
    "the burst timescale is somewhat shorter than that suggested by the stellar census and was chosen as a conservative assumption , since a shorter burst will produce softer radiation fields at late ages and thus minimize any need to invoke other effects for explaining the observed soft radiation .",
    "the decay of line ratios with time is similar to figure [ fsbmods ] , but the ratios at any given time are higher due to the higher log u in this smaller region . at the age of 7 myr preferred by the stellar census , the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is still about 1 to 2 , well above the value of 0.05 observed by lutz _",
    "the model reaches the observed value only after more than 13 myr , which is difficult to reconcile with the presence of evolved massive stars approaching 100 m@xmath125 ( najarro _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; ott , eckart , & genzel 1999 ) . while aging effects push the galactic center neon ratio more closely into agreement with models , they are not enough to fully account for the low observed neon ratio .",
    "the stellar census for the galactic center gives an independent view through direct analysis of the contributions of different stellar types to the ionizing continuum .",
    "figure  [ fgcmod ] presents an hertzsprung - russell diagram weighted by lyman continuum luminosity , derived from the same starburst model for an age of 7 myr .",
    "it is evident that most of the ionizing luminosity still originates in stars close to the main sequence at log t= 4.5 to 4.6 , with smaller contributions by stars somewhat evolved towards lower temperatures and a population of hot wr stars to the left of the main sequence .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the finding by najarro _",
    "( 1997 ) that 7 of their stars , found at log t @xmath126 4.5 and log l @xmath8 5.75 , contribute half of the ionizing luminosity of the galactic center .",
    "the same region holds less than 1% of the ionizing luminosity for the model in figure  [ fgcmod ] . at all other model ages ,",
    "this fraction does not exceed about 1% .",
    "the fact that the discrepancy between ` hard ' models and ` soft ' observations is seen both in the photoionization modelling and the stellar census leads us to the conclusion that this discrepancy is not primarily due to uncertainties in the hot star seds used for the photoionization models .",
    "such uncertainties affect mainly the shape of the ionizing flux and thus the fine structure line ratios , but much less the total ionizing flux of the star and the census .",
    "another possibility is that the adopted geneva stellar evolutionary tracks @xcite do not predict the large number of 20,000  k to 30,000k supergiants seen in the galactic center , or that there exists a mismatch between the stellar effective temperatures from evolutionary tracks and those from stellar atmosphere models .",
    "the corresponding region is populated by these tracks but only for short intervals , possibly because massive , post - main - sequence stars rapidly move off to hotter parts of the tracks .",
    "the disagreement between tracks and observations may be related to the difficulty of defining mass loss , atmospheres , and effective temperatures for late stages of massive star evolution governed by strong winds .",
    "our conclusions are unchanged when using evolutionary tracks with twice solar metallicity @xcite and higher mass loss @xcite , which might be adequate for the somewhat higher metallicity in the galactic center .",
    "the latter tracks in fact increase the disagreement by adding more very hot wr stars .",
    "in fact , wr stars may contribute to the uncertainties in the evolutionary tracks , as our knowledge of the ionizing spectra of wr stars is uncertain .",
    "indeed , there is both observational and theoretical evidence @xcite which suggests that the ionizing spectra of wr stars may be much softer than commonly assumed .",
    "the case of the galactic center has obvious implications for aging starbursts with similar populations .",
    "if the current geneva tracks , interpreted in the fashion described above , indeed mispredict the post - main - sequence evolution of massive stars by postulating very hot stars where the galactic center shows us a cooler luminous population , then starburst models will tend to predict too high values for ratios like [ neiii]/[neii ] .",
    "the resultant `` need '' to invoke low upper mass cutoffs ( or aging effects ) to explain soft radiation fields may be due to this effect .",
    "corrections for this effect would likely lower the neon ratios , and thus relax the stringent conditions of short burst time scales , leading to more plausible timescales of @xmath12410@xmath4 years .",
    "while a careful study is needed to test the reliability of current evolutionary tracks , this analysis of the galactic center supports our general conclusion that starbursts are `` normal '' star - forming environments , in the sense that they produce very massive stars just as local star forming regions do .",
    "starburst modeling is , by the very nature of the star formation process , a multi - parameter problem . to assess the robustness of the results we have presented",
    ", we now discuss the effects of varying the possible input parameters of our model , considering variations in starburst seds and nebular parameters .",
    "the most significant changes in a starburst sed will arise because of our choice of metallicity , model sed libraries for individual stars , or the shape of the imf .",
    "changes in nebular parameters have effects of similar magnitude as those of changes in seds .",
    "the most significant effects will be due to variations in the ionization parameter , though variations in the dust population as well as the density of the gas in these regions also have minor effects .",
    "for simplicity , these variations are illustrated for single - cluster models with @xmath27=100@xmath2  and @xmath21=1  myr in figure [ fvariation ] .      of the above effects , those of metallicity are the most significant .",
    "metallicity effects are twofold : at sub - solar metallicities , the stellar seds are harder due to reduced line blanketing and blocking ( e.g. , pauldrach _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , and the evolutionary track each star follows through the h - r diagram changes , producing a  hotter  main sequence . figure [ fvariation]a compares the neon ratios for two models , the hybrid sed grid at solar metallicity , and the corresponding hybrid grid with stars and gas at 0.2  @xmath26 , which is more appropriate for the two low - metallicity dwarf galaxies in our sample . lowering the metallicity results in considerably increased neon ratios : for z=0.2@xmath26 , the predicted neon ratios increase by factors of @xmath14 - 10 . the increase in neon ratios at low metallicity",
    "is dominated by changes in the evolutionary tracks and seds of model stars , with the corresponding changes to gas - phase abundances playing a relatively minor role .",
    "ngc 5253 and iizw40 have neon ratios 3 and 13 times higher , respectively , than in any of the other starbursts in our sample ; the observed ratio values are also plotted as horizontal grey lines in figure [ fvariation]a .",
    "therefore , even accounting for low metallicity , the neon ratios measured for these systems are consistent with a stellar population with @xmath27@xmath850 - 100@xmath2 .",
    "in contrast with the example of figure [ fvariation]a , models with z@xmath127 will have correspondingly lower predicted neon ratios ; this factor is worth considering if more accurate determinations of abundances become available .      if we were to choose kurucz instead of pauldrach seds to represent the most massive stars , the contribution of the softer kurucz spectra for high - mass stars would produce lower neon ratios ( cf .",
    "figure [ fseds ] ) .",
    "the significance of this effect can be seen in figure [ fvariation]b , which shows the neon ratio for two input stellar grids : the interpolated , hybrid grid we are using , and a standard kurucz model grid . at a burst age of @xmath13  myr , the predicted neon ratio using kurucz seds is a factor of @xmath12 lower than that predicted by our hybrid grid .",
    "comparison with our iso - sws data would suggest @xmath27@xmath850@xmath2   for more than half the sample , even at zero - age .",
    "we have taken a salpeter imf to be the most representative form of the initial mass function ; however , the universality of the imf is still debated ( see , e.g. , massey 1998 and scalo 1998 for contrasting views ) .",
    "some authors have suggested that the imf in active star - forming environments is well - represented by a salpeter form ( hunter 1995 ; massey & hunter 1998 ) . while the alternative model favored by scalo ( 1998 ) exhibits a steeper function at intermediate masses , it is similar to salpeter at the high - mass end ( m@xmath610@xmath2 ) , where the neon ratio is most sensitive . to illustrate the effects of changing the imf , we show the resulting neon ratios for a miller & scalo ( 1979 ) imf in figure [ fvariation]b , where this imf is represented as a power law with index @xmath128 for m=1 - 10@xmath2   and @xmath54 for m=10 - 100@xmath2 .",
    "the miller - scalo imf is generally steeper than salpeter , and thus there are fewer massive stars formed relative to a given number of low - mass stars .",
    "the net result is a softer composite sed and a prediction of lower neon line ratios .",
    "the decrease in the predicted neon ratio caused by changing the imf in this way is smaller than that caused by changing sed libraries .",
    "figure [ fvariation]c shows the predicted neon ratios for two alternate values of the ionization parameter : log u@xmath129 , the upper limit for u assuming that all clusters lie at the center of the starburst nebular emission region of m82 ( schreiber 1999 ) , and log u@xmath130 , a value more similar to that derived by wang , heckman , & lehnert ( 1997 ) for the diffuse ionized medium ( dim ) .",

    "this variation is smaller than the uncertainties in the measured neon line ratios , and negligible compared to the other parameter variations we have explored .",
    "we conclude therefore that we have introduced no significant uncertainties by neglecting dust in earlier sections .",
    "note , however , that the uncertainties are larger for determinations of l@xmath110/l@xmath56 , where dust could have a much more significant effect .    due to the large uncertainties in inferring the gas density from the siii ( 18.7/33.5@xmath0 m ) ratio ,",
    "we also show in figure [ fvariation]d the effects of increasing the gas density to 10@xmath133 @xmath64 .",
    "this is the highest density consistent with the range of measured sulfur ratios and their uncertainties . for the model shown , the neon line ratio increases by less than five percent over the entire age range , indicating that variations in gas densities have a negligible effect on the output neon ratios .",
    "however , we note that the ionization parameter changes inversely with gas density , such that this increase in gas density would also imply a drop in the ionization parameter to approximately log u@xmath134 , thus solidifying the case for very massive stars being present in the starbursts in our sample .",
    "the models we have presented thus far assume that the only contribution to the mir neon line fluxes comes from direct photoionization by stars in the starburst region itself . in this section",
    "we examine constraints , from iso spectroscopy , on the possible contributions of two other processes : excitation by active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and contributions from a diffuse ionized medium ( dim ) in the surrounding galaxy ( e.g. , lehnert & heckman 1994 ; wang _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "the mir spectra of agns are distinctive in their display of strong emission lines from highly ionized species , such as [ ne  v ] and [ o  iv ] , which require higher excitation that can be produced even by the hottest stars .",
    "the absence of these lines , or their weakness relative to lower excitation lines , has been used to demonstrate the dominant contribution of star formation to the power produced in ultraluminous ir galaxies ( lutz _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; genzel _ et al .",
    "though some starbursts show very weak [ o  iv ] emission , the most plausible explanation is ionizing shocks from supernovae or superwinds ( lutz _ et al .",
    "the sample presented here significantly overlaps with the lutz _",
    "( 1998 ) sample , and strong [ o  iv ] emission is generally not seen ; furthermore , the shock models which reproduce the weak [ o  iv ] fluxes show negligible contributions to the [ ne  ii ] and [ ne  iii ] lines analyzed here .",
    "there are two possible exceptions . in ngc  6240 ,",
    "faint [ o  iv ] emission is detected but it is stronger than that measured in `` normal '' starbursts . in ngc  7469 , a comparison of [ o  iv ] and [ ne  iii ] line profiles suggests some agn contribution to the [ ne  iii ] emission .",
    "we therefore consider the measured neon ratios for ngc  6240 and ngc  7469 to be upper limits to the emission arising from the starburst region . with these exceptions in mind",
    ", we consider the contribution from an agn to be unlikely across the sample , and any contribution must have a neglible effect on the results presented here .",
    "studies of the milky way and other nearby galaxies suggest the presence of a `` diffuse ionized medium '' ( dim ) , a gas component with a relatively low ionization state and large scale height which permeates the galaxy disk ( e.g. , reynolds 1990 ; dettmar 1992 )",
    ". it may be difficult to exclude a dim component as a contributor to the neon line fluxes measured for this sample .",
    "several studies have shown the existence of diffuse , ionized emission in the disks of galaxies , which is generally not associated with individual star forming regions .",
    "for the more distant objects in our sample , the aperture covers a large physical area ( the long axis of the sws aperture corresponds to linear diameters of 0.3 - 14  kpc for the galaxies observed ) , which may encompass non - starburst emitting regions elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "thus , we must consider the possibility that some form of dim emission may influence the integrated line fluxes .",
    "lehnert & heckman ( 1994 ) and ferguson _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) showed evidence that the dim may be produced by ionizing starlight escaping from hii regions in the disks of galaxies ; wang _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) measured its effects on large scale measurements of optical excitation ratios such as [ nii / h@xmath95 ] and [ sii / h@xmath95 ] .",
    "these studies suggest that the dim may contribute as much as 50% of the global , integrated h@xmath95 flux in spiral galaxies .",
    "if we assume that the dim consists of ionizing radiation escaping from young star clusters , with the same average parameters as derived by wang _",
    "( log u@xmath136 , n@xmath631 @xmath64 ) , then the model neon ratios could drop by a factor of two , making the effect of a dim contribution similar in magnitude to that of variations in the ionization parameter that were discussed in ",
    "[ ssparams ] .",
    "we can not exclude the contribution from a low - density component , as the [ s iii ] ratio generally provides only an upper limit to the density .",
    "however , we have a qualitative constraint supplied by the range of neon line ratios observed in our sample : the observed neon ratios show no correlation with distance , as seen in figure [ fneondist ] . if the dim were a significant contributor , we might expect the neon ratio to decrease with increasing source distance , as the aperture encloses an ever larger physical area . in the nearest galaxy in our sample ,",
    "ic 342 , the aperture encloses an area @xmath1200 pc in diameter , and for galaxies at a distance of 30 mpc the aperture still covers a region less than 5 kpc in diameter . thus ,",
    "unless we are observing objects in which the size of the starburst area grows in proportion to its distance , we conclude that any dim - like component in the sample galaxies does not make a significant contribution .",
    "any dim contributions will result in lower predicted neon ratios ; thus , our conclusion that the most massive stars are generally formed in all starburst environments is not affected .",
    "the cluster models that we have presented in this paper support the formation of very massive stars ( 50 - 100@xmath2 ) in starburst galaxies . while the quantitative estimate of @xmath27  for each galaxy is model - dependent , it is clear that the formation of very massive stars is necessary to explain the ionized line diagnostics observed in this starburst sample .",
    "this result suggests that while starbursts produce prodigious amounts of energy and stars , the high - mass stellar populations in starburst galaxies are not radically different than those in high - mass star - forming regions observed locally .      as illustrated in figures [ fsbmods ] and [ fsbmodsllyc ] ,",
    "the combination of the neon line ratio with the @xmath13/@xmath113  ratio strongly favors the scenario for starburst activity where very massive stars form , as in local smaller - scale starburst templates , and where the burst last typically a few million to @xmath110@xmath4 years .",
    "such timescales are shorter than previously thought ( 10@xmath137 ; e.g. , thronson & telesco 1986 ; heckman 1998 ) .",
    "it is clear that detailed modeling is required to secure this result , including additional constraints ( _ e.g. _ @xmath138-band luminosity , the rate of supernova explosions , the depth of the near - infrared co bandheads ) and spatially resolved information .",
    "it is nonetheless in agreement with other recent detailed studies of a few starburst galaxies , some of which are also included in our sample ( _ e.g. _ m82 , schreiber 1999 ; ngc253 , engelbracht _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . as a result of instrumental progress , there is now growing evidence that starburst activity occurs in individual burst sites on physical scales of a few tens of parsecs or less .",
    "short timescales are therefore naturally understandable locally .",
    "our data , in conjunction with the other studies cited above , provide evidence for short timescales on much larger scales , suggesting that starburst activity also occurs _ globally _ on short timescales , presumably as a result of one brief gas compression event , or of successive episodes of such events separated by more than one typical timescale .",
    "short burst durations thus imply strong negative feedback effects of starburst activity , globally as well as locally .    a simple argument can be invoked to explain the physical arguments behind this result .",
    "we can compare the cumulative kinetic energy injected in the ism by the supernova explosions over time ( @xmath139 ) with the binding energy of the gas ( @xmath140 ) , and assume the starburst activity will stop when @xmath141 just balances @xmath140 .",
    "this is a simplistic way of expressing the conditions for a starburst wind to break out of the galaxy ( _ e.g. _ heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) , but it is sufficient for order - of - magnitude estimates .    in order to relate @xmath141 to observed quantities , we have considered the relationship between the rate of supernova explosions @xmath142  and the bolometric luminosity @xmath112 .",
    "model predictions obtained with stars for a variety of star formation histories and upper mass cutoffs of the imf indicate that @xmath143 as soon as the massive stars start to explode as supernovae , and as long as substantial star formation takes place .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to assume that equation ( 4 ) holds for the bulk of the sample , likely having a range in age and timescale but all exhibiting signs of significant , recent starburst activity .    for simplicity , we here assume a spherical geometry for the starbursts , with uniform mass distribution .",
    "in addition , we assume that each supernova explosion liberates @xmath144 of mechanical energy , transferred as kinetic energy to the ism with an efficiency @xmath145 . the timescale @xmath146 for our condition above satisfies : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the rate of mechanical energy injection from the supernovae , @xmath149 is the gravitational constant",
    ", @xmath150 is the dynamical mass of the system , and @xmath32 is the radius of the starburst region . equation ( 5 ) can be re - written as @xmath151 where we have substituted @xmath13  for @xmath112 , appropriate for our sample galaxies . application of equation ( 6 ) to m82 ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) , yields @xmath155 , so for efficiencies @xmath156 , the estimated timescales are @xmath157 .",
    "our argument above is based on `` gas - disruption timescale '' estimates .",
    "this differs from the conventional `` gas - consumption '' arguments , which compare the star formation rates with the mass of the gas reservoir . in such estimates ,",
    "the star formation rates are based on comparison of absolute fluxes ( _ e.g. _ h@xmath95 fluxes , @xmath13 ) with predictions from starburst models .",
    "the estimates are thus very sensitive to the assumed age and history of the starburst .",
    "our estimates of the gas - disruption timescales are also model - dependent , but have the advantage of being based on a quantity ( @xmath158 ) which varies by smaller factors .",
    "neither point of view accounts for further fueling processes , or dynamical evolution of the systems ( _ e.g. _ starbursts in barred galaxies , interacting / merging systems , etc . ) .",
    "however , the discussion presented here gives an alternative perspective to the issue of global burst timescales , and provides a plausible explanation for our results .",
    "starburst models predicting the [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] ratio from iso - sws spectra of 27 starburst galaxies show that the observed data are consistent with the formation of very massive stars in starbursts , thus precluding the need for the restrictive upper mass cutoffs suggested by some earlier studies ( @xmath27@xmath125 - 30@xmath2 ) . combining the neon line ratios with starburst modeling and the consideration of the stellar content measured in local star forming regions , we find that starburst events may be generally described as short bursts of star formation which produce very massive stars , and which exhibit relatively soft integrated line ratios as a result of aging the stellar population .",
    "these results suggest strong negative feedback from starburst activity ; the galactic superwinds frequently observed in starburst galaxies are particularly striking examples of the consequences of such feedback .    in our analysis",
    ", we have examined the degeneracy between aging effects and model parameter variations in the assessment of upper mass cutoffs to the imf .",
    "there is still room for significant improvements in modeling the properties of starbursts : determination of metallicities and the radiation environment ( e.g. , for measurements of the ionization parameter u ) compete with the characterization of stellar properties ( seds , evolutionary tracks ) as the largest contributors to uncertainty in the modeling of star formation properties such as the upper mass cutoff .",

    "<S> we present new iso - sws data for a sample of 27 starburst galaxies , and with these data examine the issues of formation and evolution of the most massive stars in starburst galaxies . using starburst models which incorporate time evolution , new stellar atmosphere models for massive stars , and a starburst model geometry derived from observations of the prototypical starburst m82 </S>",
    "<S> , we model the integrated mid - infrared line ratio [ ne  iii](15.6@xmath0m)/[ne  ii](12.8@xmath0 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> this line ratio is sensitive to the hardness of the stellar energy distribution and therefore to the most massive stars present .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from our models , with consideration of recent determinations of the stellar census in local , high - mass star forming regions , that the [ ne  iii]/[ne  ii ] ratios we measure are consistent with the formation of massive ( @xmath1 50 - 100@xmath2 ) stars in most starbursts . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> , the low nebular excitation inferred from the measured line ratios can be attributed to aging effects . by including estimates of the ratio of infrared - to - lyman continuum luminosity for the galaxies in our sample , we further find that most starbursts are relatively short - lived ( 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4 years ) , only a few o - star lifetimes . we discuss a possible cause of such short events : the effectiveness of stellar winds and supernovae in destroying the starburst environment . </S>"
