    "the graal @xmath19-ray beam at the esrf is produced by the backward scattering in flight of laser photons on the relativistic electrons circulating in the storage ring .",
    "this technique , first used on a storage ring for the ladon beam on the adone at frascati @xcite , produces polarized and tagged @xmath19-ray beams with very high polarization and good energy resolution . at its maximum energy the beam polarization is very close to the one of the laser photons ( linear or circular ) @xcite and can be easily rotated or changed with conventional optical components changing the polarization of the laser light .",
    "it remains above 74% for photon energy above 70% of its maximum . with the 6.03 gev esrf accelerator and the 351 nm line of an argon ( ion ) laser , the maximum @xmath19-ray",
    "energy obtainable is 1487 mev and the spectrum is almost flat over the whole tagged spectrum .",
    "the energy resolution of the tagged beam is limited by the optics of the esrf magnetic lattice and is 16 mev ( fwhm ) over the entire spectrum .",
    "the graal apparatus has been described in several papers @xcite . a cylindrical liquid hydrogen ( or deuterium ) target is located on the beam and coaxial with it .",
    "the detector covers the entire solid angle and is divided into three parts .",
    "the central part , @xmath20 , is covered by two cylindrical wire chambers , a barrel made of 32 plastic scintillators and a bgo crystal ball made of 480 crystals which is well suited for the detection of @xmath19-rays of energy below 1.5 gev .",
    "the chambers , the barrel and the bgo are all coaxial with the beam and the target . the wire chambers detect and measure the positions and angles of the charged particles emitted by the target while the scintillating barrel measures their energy loss .",
    "the bgo ball detects charged and neutral particles and measures the energy deposited by them . for neutral particles it provides a measurement of their angles by its granularity ( 480 crystals : 15 in the @xmath21 direction and 32 in the @xmath22 direction ) .",
    "at forward angles , @xmath23 , the particles emitted from the target encounter first two plane wire chambers which measure their angles , then , at 3 meters from the center of the target , two planes of plastic scintillators , made of 26 horizontal and 26 vertical bars to measure the particles position , specific ionization and time of flight , and then a thick ( shower wall ) wall made of a sandwich of scintillators and lead to detect charged particles , @xmath19-rays and neutrons .",
    "the tof resolution of these scintillators is of the order of 560 ps ( fwhm ) for charged particles and 900 ps for neutrons .",
    "the total thickness of the plastic scintillators is 20 cm and the detection efficiency is about 20% for neutrons and 95% for @xmath19-rays .",
    "backward angles , @xmath24 , are covered by two disks of plastic scintillators separated by 6 mm of lead to detect charged particles and gamma - rays escaping in the backward direction .",
    "the energy of the @xmath19-rays is provided by the tagging set - up which is located inside the esrf shielding , attached to the esrf vacuum system .",
    "the electrons which have scattered off a laser photon and produced a @xmath19-ray have lost a significant fraction of their energy and therefore drift away from the equilibrium orbit of the stored electrons and finally hit the vacuum chamber of the storage ring . before hitting the vacuum chamber they are detected by the tagging system , which measures their displacement from the equilibrium orbit .",
    "this displacement is a measure of the difference between their energy and that of the stored electron beam and therefore provides a measure of the energy of the gamma - ray produced .",
    "the tagging system @xcite consists of 10 plastic scintillators and a 128 channels solid state microstrip detector with a pitch of 300 @xmath25 m .",
    "the plastic scintillators signals are synchronized by gaas electronics with the rf accelerating system , and provide a timing for the entire electronics of the graal apparatus with a resolution of 180 ps ( fwhm ) .",
    "this allows clear discrimination between electrons coming from two adjacent electron bunches that are separated by 2.8 ns .",
    "the microstrips provide the position of the scattered electron and therefore the energy of the associated gamma - ray .",
    "their pitch ( 300 @xmath25 m ) has been set in order to limit the number of tagging channels without appreciable reduction of the gamma - ray energy resolution imposed by the characteristics of the storage ring .",
    "the detector is located inside a shielding box positioned in a modified section of the ring vacuum chamber .",
    "the shielding box is positioned at 10 mm from the circulating electron beam .",
    "this limits the lowest tagged gamma - ray energy to about 550 mev .",
    "the data analysis is based on the following direct measurements : the energy , @xmath26 , of the incident photon measured by the tagging detector ; the energy , @xmath27 , of the proton measured in the bgo or by the tof in the forward wall ; the polar and azimuthal angles @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the proton and @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the pion measured by the planar and cylindrical mwpcs @xcite .",
    "the energy of the pion , @xmath32 , is obtained by the reaction energy balance neglecting the fermi energy of the neutron in the deuterium target ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the charged particle identification in the central part of the apparatus ( 25@xmath34155@xmath35 ) was performed using a cut in the bi - dimensional plot of the energy lost in the barrel versus the energy measured by the bgo calorimeter@xcite . in the forward direction",
    "( @xmath36 25@xmath35 ) it was obtained using the bi - dimensional cut on energy lost versus tof measured by the plastic scintillator wall@xcite .",
    "we also applied to each detected charged particle the condition that a coincidence of the signals from the three charged particle detectors is obtained .",
    "our simulation , based on geant3@xcite and on a realistic event generator@xcite has shown that , with the preliminary selection of the events obtained by the constraint that proton and pion are the only charged particles detected in the graal apparatus , the number of events coming from other reaction channels is lower than 14% .",
    "[ coplan ]    the quantities measured in the graal - experiment exceed the number required for a full kinematical reconstruction of the event in a ( quasi-)two - body kinematics .",
    "therefore it is possible to calculate all kinematic variables using only a subset of the measured ones .",
    "for example , the polar angle of the pion , @xmath37 , and the energy of the proton , @xmath38 , have been calculated from the other measured quantities and then compared with the results of their direct observations .",
    "[ fermiric ]    therefore the background from the other reaction channels was drastically reduced with the following constraints : + 1 .",
    "we reject all events with additional signals from neutral particles in the bgo or in the shower wall ; + 2 .",
    "we impose coplanarity of the p and @xmath18 by the condition @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the experimental variance of the distribution indicated in fig .",
    "[ coplan ] ; + 3 .",
    "we impose the condition : @xmath41 where : @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is the component of the fermi momentum of the target nucleon calculated from the measured kinematical variables neglecting its fermi energy ; @xmath44 is its value obtained at the end of a recursive process in which at each stage the fermi momentum is calculated by inserting into the energy - momentum conservation equations the value of the fermi energy derived by the value of the fermi momentum resulting from the previous iteration .",
    "the iterations stop when the difference of the modules of the fermi momentum in two successive iterations is less than 10 kev / c .",
    "the cut value , 10 mev / c , was suggested by the simulation in order to minimize the loss of good events ( see fig .",
    "[ fermiric ] ) ; +    [ thetene ]    \\4 .",
    "the last constraint is : @xmath45 where @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the measured angle of the @xmath18 while @xmath48 is the calculated value from the angle @xmath49 of the proton and the gamma - ray energy @xmath50 provided by the tagger ; @xmath51/@xmath52 , where @xmath52 is the measured value of the proton energy and @xmath38 is the calculated value from @xmath50 and @xmath30 ; @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the mean values and the variances obtained by a gaussian fit to the experimental distributions ; @xmath57 is the correlation parameter obtained by a combined best fit of @xmath58 and @xmath59 with a bidimensional gaussian surface(see figs .",
    "[ thetene ] ) .",
    "@xmath60 has been empirically set at 3 , after several attempts , to minimize the loss of good events and at the same time the acceptance of events from competing reactions . as a results",
    "the contribution of spurious events is less than 2.3% as indicated by the simulation .",
    "other systematic errors arise from our imperfect knowledge of the beam polarization due to the laser optics and other minor effects and do not exceed 2% in total .",
    "the wire chambers provide the distribution of the reaction vertex@xcite inside the deuterium target .",
    "fig.[vert ] shows that the source of our events is well localized inside the liquid d@xmath15 .",
    "[ vert ]    to check the invariance of our results with respect to the selection criteria in a independent analysis we have : i ) plotted alternatively @xmath61 vs. @xmath62 - 180@xmath35 which has the advantage that the physical quantities are not correlated as shown in fig .",
    "[ thetaphi ] ; ii ) applied an independent cut on the variable @xmath63 ; iii ) introduced a cut for @xmath64 250 mev / c instead of the condition 3 - inequality ( 1 ) .",
    "the results of the two procedures are consistent within one standard deviation @xcite .",
    "[ thetaphi ]    as a further check we have plotted ( see fig .",
    "[ fermicut ] ) the fermi momentum calculated for all events ( spurious included ) and that calculated for the `` good '' events ( those that have passed our selection ) .",
    "the effect of the cuts on the degree of coplanarity of the reaction products and on the fermi momentum is indicated in figs .",
    "[ coplan ] and [ fermicut ] respectively .",
    "[ fermicut ]    our simulation data show that the gaussian fit of the difference between the fermi momentum reconstructed by our detectors and the one generated by using the paris potential @xcite present a sigma of about 16.9 mev / c .",
    "the cuts provide a distribution of the fermi momentum consistent with our knowledge of the structure of the deuteron excluding the spurious events that would require an anomalously large fermi momentum to satisfy a quasi - two - body kinematic .",
    "fig.[fermiparis ] compares the experimental and simulated fermi momentum distributions . for the simulation we have used the paris potential @xcite and processed the simulated events through the same analysis software of our data .",
    "[ fermiparis ]    the beam polarization asymmetries have been calculated as we did in refs .",
    "@xcite using the symmetry of the central detector around the beam axis . in the same references",
    "are indicated the various checks performed to verify the stability of our results .",
    "more than 99% of the events that survived the cuts produce a reconstructed fermi momentum lower than 250 mev / c . for this reason the results presented in fig .",
    "[ asym ] and in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] were obtained without any direct cut on the reconstructed fermi momentum distribution .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a discussion of possible sources of systematic errors , in particular we have shown that we obtain the same asymmetries , in the overlapping region , using the green or uv laser lines .",
    "these lines produce gamma - ray beams with different spectra and polarizations and their comparison eliminates one main source of systematic errors .",
    "in this paper , we report on the first tagged measurement of the @xmath14 reaction by the graal collaboration in the energy range from 753  mev to 1438  mev .",
    "the available statistics allowed the determination of the angular sigma - beam asymmetry for 11 bins in the incident - photon energy and 9 angular bins .",
    "our results for the asymmetries are shown in fig .",
    "[ asym ] together with previous results  @xcite and some theoretical models .",
    "the graal data and the results from previous untagged measurements  @xcite appear to agree well in the overlapping energies . as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite but also in this analysis we have obtained the same asymmetries using independently two different set of criteria for the event selection .",
    "moreover the close similarity between the asymmetries measured on the free proton ( in hydrogen ) and those of quasi - free proton ( in deuterium ) encourages the assumption that the asymmetries measured on the quasi - free neutron ( in deuterium ) could be close to those on free neutrons .",
    "multipole amplitude analyses provide a powerful tool for extracting information about the reaction process in as nearly a model - independent manner as possible @xcite .",
    "this approach , in turn , facilitates the identification of s - channel resonances involved in the reaction process .",
    "said - ma09 is the solution that includes our results and recent graal results for @xmath13  @xcite in the best fit while said - sp09 does not include both of them  @xcite .",
    "the earlier maid2007 solution  @xcite is also included in fig .",
    "[ asym ] for comparison . the status of the maid database for the maid2007 solution is the same as for said - sp09 .",
    "the overall @xmath65/graal data is 483 , 2634 , and 8793 per 99 graal @xmath0s for said - ma09 , said - sp09 , and maid2007 solutions , respectively .",
    "the said - sp09 solution is consistent with our data in the forward angular region where previous results constrained the fit . in the backward region and at energies above 1100",
    "mev , the agreement becomes satisfactory only after inclusion of our data .",
    "the maid2007 solution agrees with our data in the forward region .",
    "both said - sp09 and maid2007 results exhibit structures not seen in the data and which explain the poor @xmath65 for both cases .",
    "neutron multipoles from the said - ma09 fit are compared to the earlier said - sp09 determinations in fig .",
    "3 . both ma09 and sp09 are quite similar , but significant differences between them in magnitude ( e.g. ,",
    "s@xmath66 , d@xmath67 , and f@xmath68 ) are seen . with the addition of graal @xmath18p and @xmath16n asymmetries ,",
    "the said solution is now far more reliable than in previously published analyses .",
    "extending our knowledge of the asymmetry to the backward directions , the results of this experiment constrain the models in the angular region where they had the largest variations and the major differences among themselves .",
