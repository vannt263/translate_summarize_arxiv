    "the second quantization of the string is one of the most important issue in the string theory .",
    "there has been considerable works for the second - quantization of the string theoy.@xcite especially the extension for the superstring theory@xcite needs complicated formulation since the superstring field theory suffers from many problems as picture - changing interactions and lorentz invariance.@xcite    on the other hand , the non - perturbative analysis for the string theory has been developed recently .",
    "the new ideas as d - branes and m - theory give more profound understanding for the strongly coupled string theory .",
    "therefore , there are many approach for the description of m - theory . some of them are matrix theory@xcite and matrix string theory.@xcite",
    "especially , matrix string theory describes m - theory in terms of a @xmath1 dimensional super yang - mills theory and this theory goes to the conformal field theory on the symmetric product space in the ir limit .",
    "the ir dynamics of the matrix string was well - analyzed in terms of super yang - mills theory.@xcite there are many progresses in this direction recently.@xcite    the analysis of the string theory on the symmetric product space was given for the closed string case.@xcite@xcite the twisted sector can be interpreted physically as the _ long string _ which is constituted from the _ string bits _ by connecting their edges .",
    "this interpretation can be established further by evaluating the partition function .",
    "the generating function of the partition function is expressed by exponential lifting of the one - body partition function .",
    "this nature of the partition function is the string theory version of the sum of the connected feynman diagrams for vacuum in the quantum field theory . as discussed by l.susskind@xcite",
    ", this partition function has the structure of the discrete lightcone quantization ( dlcq ) .",
    "thus this theory can be interpreted as the second - quantized string theory in dlcq .    in the previous work@xcite",
    ", we developed these ideas into the bosonic open string theory . in the open string case ,",
    "the twisted sector on the orbifold singularity of the symmetric product can be also interpreted as the long strings .",
    "but these long strings have two types , the long open strings and the long closed strings .",
    "furthermore , the annulus partition function can be interpreted as the annulus , mbius strip , klein bottle and torus partition function in terms of the long string sense .",
    "therefore this theory can be interpreted as the second quantization of the unoriented open / closed string theory . to establish this structure",
    ", we constructed the boundary states for this theory .",
    "these boundary states are classified into three types , the boundary states , the cross - cap states , and the joint states . here",
    "the joint states describes the connection of two strings at the boundary .",
    "the appearance of the cross - cap states means that this theory describes the unoriented theory and joint state implies the possibility of open / closed interactions .",
    "so the physical interpretation can be explained naturally from the closed string sector .",
    "finally we discussed the consistent chan - paton gauge group for the anomaly - free theory .",
    "this group can be determined from the dilaton tadpole cancellation , and the result was @xmath2 as ordinary string theory .    generally speaking , the representation of the second - quantized string theory by the symmetric product is much simpler than the string field theory .",
    "especially , as the superstring field theory has complicated formulation , we aim to describe open superstring theory in simple way . in this paper",
    ", we extended the ideas in the previous work@xcite to the open superstring case .",
    "we found the boundary condition for fermionic fields on the non - abelian orbifold by the @xmath3 extension of the bosonic boundary conditions and classified the solutions for the consistency conditions of the permutation orbifold .",
    "for these classified boundary conditions .",
    "we calculated the partition function and examined that the annulus , mbius strip , klein bottle and torus partition function for the superstring appears . in the closed string sector , we constructed the boundary / cross - cap states for the fermionic fields .",
    "the fermionic boundary states also describe the boundary , cross - cap and joint states and explain the change of the topology of the world - sheet . finally , from the dilaton tadpole",
    "cancellation condition , the chan - paton group can be determined to be @xmath0 as ordinary type i superstring .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the closed string on the symmetric product space . here",
    "we calculate the partition function for the superstring in detail as the preparation for the open string calculation . in section 3",
    ", we consider the consisteny condition for the periodicities and boundary conditions of non - abelian orbifold and classify the solutions .",
    "then we calculate the fermionic partition function for the irreducible sets .",
    "these considerations are made for the annulus , mbius strip and klein bottle diagrams .",
    "these results are summarized in the final subsection and we will calculate the the generating function for the partition functions . in section 4 , we construct the boundary / cross - cap states for fermionic string . after the classification for the irreducible combination of the periodicity and the boundary condition , we calculate the inner products of the boundary states which correspond to the situation of section 3 . in section 5",
    ", we consider the dilaton tadpole cancellation condition and determine the consistent chan - paton gauge group . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss about the interaction briefly and show some future direction of this work .",

    "therefore the boundary and cross - cap states for the long string is written as , @xmath474 thus the tadpole condition is satisfied when , @xmath475 and there is no constraint for @xmath471 .    for even @xmath371 ,",
    "the long string have two loose ends at one boundary and no loose end at another boundary .",
    "the boundary state @xmath476 which have no loose end does not give any contribution for the tadpole condition .",
    "therefore , we consider the tadpole condition for the boundary states which have two loose ends .",
    "we introduce the boundary states as , @xmath477 this condition is also factorized into the condition ( [ tadpole cond ] ) . therefore , if @xmath478 is satisfied , the tadpole for @xmath371 long strings is cancelled .    to determine chan - paton group , we consider the modular property for the partition functions calculated before .",
    "gathering all sectors , the inner products between the boundary states are written as , @xmath479 after the modular transformation , the amplitudes are written as , @xmath480 where we denoted @xmath481 .",
    "these expressions should be compared with the partition functions which calculated in the open string sector as , @xmath482 where @xmath14 is the rank of the chan - paton group and @xmath483 comes from the action of @xmath219 on the chan - paton group . when @xmath346 , this group is @xmath347 and when @xmath348 , this group is @xmath349 . since @xmath471 should not depend on the length factor , we need to impose @xmath484 .        under these correspondences and tadpole condition ( [ tadpole coeff ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the following relations , @xmath491 these equations can be solved as , @xmath492 thus the consistent chan - paton group is @xmath0 , and this is the standard gauge group for type i theory .    for r-@xmath140 sector , the tadpole cancellation condition can be found in similar way .",
    "the gso - projected boundary and cross - cap states for r-@xmath140 sector is written as , @xmath493 since the coefficient @xmath494 should not depend on the length of the long string , we set @xmath495 the boundary state for odd @xmath371 is expressed as the products of the boundary , cross - cap and joint states , latexmath:[\\ ] ] we depicted above interaction in figure 7 .",
    "however we do not know whether this interaction vertex becomes lorentz invariant and can be consistently introduced to our model .",
    "this is one of the most important issue which should be clarified in the future work .",
    "the intereting problem for the future work is as follows .",
    "the description of the second - quantized superstring theory is discussed in a slightly different way.@xcite the fermionic @xmath3-twisting is identified with the @xmath508 , and the supersymmetry is described in more compact way .",
