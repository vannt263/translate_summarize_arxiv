    "the idea of using a solid elastic sphere as a gravitational wave ( gw ) antenna is almost as old as that of using cylindrical bars : as far back as 1971 forward published a paper  @xcite in which he assessed some of the potentialities offered by a spherical solid for that purpose .",
    "it was however weber s ongoing philosophy and practice of using bars which eventually prevailed and developed up to the present date , with the highly sophisticated and sensitive ultra - cryogenic systems currently in operation see",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for reviews and bibliography . with few exceptions  @xcite , spherical detectors fell into oblivion for years , but interest in them strongly re - emerged in the early 1990 s , and an important number of research articles have been published since which address a wide variety of problems in gw spherical detector science . at the same time , international collaboration has intensified , and prospects for the actual construction of large spherical gw observatories ( in the range of @xmath0100 tons ) are being currently considered in several countries , even in a variant _ hollow _ shape  @xcite .",
    "a spherical antenna is obviously omnidirectional but , most important , it is also a natural _ multi - mode _ device , i.e. , when suitably monitored , it can generate information on all the gw amplitudes and incidence direction  @xcite , a capability which possesses no other _ individual _ gw detector , whether resonant or interferometric  @xcite . furthermore , a spherical antenna could also reveal the eventual existence of _ monopole _ gravitational radiation , or set thresholds on it  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical explanation of these facts is to be found in the unique matching between the gw amplitude structure and that of the sphere oscillation eigenmodes  @xcite : a general _ metric _ gw generates a _ tidal _ field of forces in an elastic body which is given in terms of the `` electric '' components @xmath1 of the riemann tensor at its centre of mass by the following formula @xcite :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 are `` tidal form factors '' , while @xmath4 are specific linear combinations of the riemann tensor components @xmath1 which carry all the _ dynamical _ information on the gw s monopole ( @xmath5=0 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath5=2 ) amplitudes .",
    "it is precisely these amplitudes , @xmath4 , which a gw detector aims to measure .    on the other hand , a free elastic sphere has two families of oscillation eigenmodes , so called _ toroidal _ and _ spheroidal _ modes , and modes within either family group into ascending series of @xmath5-pole harmonics , each of whose frequencies is ( 2@xmath5 + 1)-fold degenerate see  @xcite for full details .",
    "it so happens that _ only _ monopole and/or quadrupole spheroidal modes can possibly be excited by an incoming _ metric _ gw  @xcite , and their gw driven amplitudes are directly proportional to the wave amplitudes @xmath4 of equation  ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "it is this very fact which makes of the spherical detector such a natural one for gw observations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a spherical antenna has a significantly higher absorption _ cross section _ than a cylinder of like fundamental frequency , and also presents good sensitivity at the _ second _ quadrupole harmonic  @xcite .    in order to monitor the",
    "gw induced deformations of the sphere _",
    "motion sensors _ are required . in cylindrical bars , current state of the art technology",
    "is based upon _ resonant transducers _",
    "a resonant transducer consists in a small ( compared to the bar ) mechanical device possessing a resonance frequency accurately tuned to that of the cylinder .",
    "this _ frequency matching _ causes back - and - forth _ resonant energy transfer _ between the two bodies ( bar and resonator ) , which results in turn in _ mechanically amplified _ oscillations of the smaller resonator .",
    "the philosophy of using resonators for motion sensing is directly transplantable to a spherical detector only a _ multiple _ set rather than a single resonator is required if its potential capabilities as a multi - mode system are to be exploited to satisfaction .    a most immediate question in a multiple motion sensor system is : _ where _ should the sensors be ?",
    "the answer to this basic question naturally depends on design and purpose criteria .",
    "merkowitz and johnson ( m&j ) made a very appealing proposal consisting in a set of 6 identical resonators coupling to the _ radial _ motions of the sphere s surface , and occupying the positions of the centres of the 6 non - parallel pentagonal faces of a truncated icosahedron  @xcite .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of such layout is that there exist 5 linear combinations of the resonators readouts which are directly proportional to the 5 quadrupole gw amplitudes @xmath6 of equation  ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "m&j call these combinations _ mode channels _ , and they therefore play a fundamental role in gw signal deconvolution in a real , _ noisy _ system  @xcite . in addition , a reduced scale prototype antenna called _ tiga _ , for _ t_runcated _ i_cosahedron _ g_ravitational _ a_ntenna was constructed at louisiana state university , and its working experimentally put to test  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable success of this experiment in almost every detail  @xcite stands as a vivid proof of the practical feasibility of a spherical gw detector  @xcite .    despite its success ,",
    "the theoretical model proposed by m&j to describe the system dynamics is based upon a simplifying assumption that the resonators _ only _ couple to to the quadrupole vibration modes of the sphere  @xcite . while this is seen _ a posteriori _ of experimental measurements to be a very good approximation  @xcite , a deeper _ physical _ reason which explains _",
    "why _ this happens is missing so far .",
    "the original motivation for the research i present in this article was to develop a more general approach , based on first principles , for the analysis of the resonator problem , very much in the spirit of the methodology and results of reference  @xcite ; this , i thought , would not only provide the necessary tools for a rigorous analysis of the system dynamics , but also contribute to improve our understanding of the physics of the spherical gw detector .    pursuing this programme , i succeeded in setting up and solving the equations of motion for the coupled system of sphere plus resonators .",
    "the most important characteristic of the solution is that it is expressible as a _ perturbative series expansion in ascending powers of the small parameter @xmath7 _ , where @xmath8 is the ratio between the average resonator s mass and the sphere s mass . the dominant ( lowest ) order terms in this expansion appear to exactly reproduce merkowitz and johnson s equations  @xcite , whence a quantitative assessment of their degree of accuracy , as well as of the range of validity of their underlying hypotheses obtains ; if further precision is required then a well defined procedure for going to next ( higher ) order terms is unambiguously prescribed by the system equations .    beyond this ,",
    "though , the simple and elegant algebra which emerges out of the general scheme has enabled the exploration of different resonator layouts , alternative to the unique _ tiga _ of m&j . in particular",
    ", i found one  @xcite requiring 5 rather than 6 resonators per quadrupole mode sensed and possessing the remarkable property that _ mode channels _ can be constructed from the system readouts , i.e. , five linear combinations of the latter which are directly proportional to the five quadrupole gw amplitudes .",
    "i called this distribution _ phc _ see below for full details .",
    "the intrinsically perturbative nature of the proposed approach makes it also particularly well adapted to assess the consequences of small defects in the system structure , such as for example symmetry breaking due to suspension attachments , small resonator mistunings and mislocations , etc .",
    "this has been successfully applied to account for the reported frequency measurements of the _ lsu tiga _",
    "prototype  @xcite , which was diametrically drilled for suspension purposes ; in particular , discrepancies between measured and calculated values ( generally affecting only the _ fourth _ decimal place ) are precisely of the theoretically predicted order of magnitude .",
    "the method has also been applied to analyse the stability of the spherical detector to several mistuned parameters , with the result that it is not very sensitive to small construction errors .",
    "this conforms again to experimental reports  @xcite , but has the advantage that the argument depends on _ analytic _ mathematical work rather than on computer simulated procedures see",
    "e.g.  @xcite or  @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : ge ] , i present the main physical hypotheses of the model , and the general equations of motion . in section  [ sec : gff ] a green function approach to solve those equations is set up , and in section  [ sec : srgw ] it is used to assess the system response to both monopole and quadrupole gw signals . in section  [ sec : phc ] i describe in detail the _ phc _ layout , including its frequency spectrum and _ mode channels_. section  [ sec : hs ] contains a few brief considerations on the system response to a hammer stroke calibration signal , and finally in section  [ sec : symdef ] i assess how the different parameter mistunings affect the detector s behaviour .",
    "the paper closes with a summary of conclusions , and three appendices where the heavier mathematical details are made precise for the interested reader .",
    "with minor improvements , i shall use the notation of references  @xcite and  @xcite , some of which is now briefly recalled . consider a solid sphere of mass @xmath9 , radius @xmath10 , ( uniform ) density @xmath11 , and elastic lam coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 , endowed with a set of @xmath14 resonators of masses @xmath15 and resonance frequencies @xmath16 ( @xmath17=1,  ,@xmath14 ) , respectively .",
    "i shall model the latter as _ point masses _ attached to one end of a linear spring , whose other end is rigidly linked to the sphere at locations  @xmath18 see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the system degrees of freedom are given by the _ field _ of elastic displacements @xmath19 of the sphere plus the _ discrete _ set of resonator spring deformations @xmath20 ; equations of motion need to be written down for them , of course , and this is my next concern in this section .",

    "the purpose of a gw detector is to determine the latter coefficients on the basis of suitable measurements .",

    "we must solve them for the unknowns @xmath58 , then perform _ inverse laplace transforms _ to revert to @xmath59 .",
    "i come to this next .",
    "our concern now is the actual system response when it is acted upon by an incoming gw .",
    "it will be calculated by making a number of simplifying assumptions , more precisely :    1 .",
    "the detector is perfectly spherical .",
    "the resonators have identical masses and resonance frequencies .",
    "the resonators frequency is accurately matched to one of the sphere s oscillation eigenfrequencies .",
    "it will be shown below ( section [ sec : symdef ] ) that a real system can be appropriately treated as one which deviates by definite amounts from this idealised construct .",
    "therefore detailed knowledge of the ideal system behaviour is essential for all purposes : such is the justification for the above simplifications .",
    "the wave - functions @xmath60 of an elastic sphere can be found in reference  @xcite in full detail , and i shall keep the notation of that paper for them .",
    "the laplace transform of the kernel matrix  ( [ m3.10 ] ) can thus be expressed as see equation  ( [ a3.20 ] ) in appendix  [ app : a ] :    @xmath61    where the last term simply _ defines _ the quantities @xmath62 .",
    "note that the sums here extend over the _ entire _ spectrum of the solid sphere .",
    "the assumption that all the resonators are _ identical _ simply means that    @xmath63    the third hypothesis makes reference to the fundamental idea behind using resonators , which is to have them tuned to one of the frequencies of the sphere s spectrum .",
    "this is expressed by    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a specific and _ fixed _ frequency of the spheroidal spectrum .    in a gw detector",
    "it will only make sense to choose @xmath66=0 or @xmath66=2 , as only monopole and quadrupole sphere modes couple to the incoming signal ; in practice , @xmath67 will refer to the first , or perhaps second harmonic  @xcite .",
    "i shall however keep the generic expression  ( [ m4.6 ] ) for the time being in order to encompass all the possibilities with a unified notation .",
    "based on the above hypotheses , equation  ( [ m3.16 ] ) can be rewritten in the form    @xmath68\\,\\hat q_b(s ) = -\\frac{s^2}{s^2+\\omega^2}\\ ,",
    "\\hat u_a^{\\rm gw}(s ) + \\frac{\\hat\\xi_a^{\\rm gw}(s ) }     { s^2+\\omega^2}\\ , \\qquad   ( \\omega = \\omega_{n_0l_0 } )     \\label{m4.8}\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 is the laplace transform of  ( [ c.4 ] ) , i.e. ,    @xmath70    as mentioned at the end of the previous section , the matrix in the lhs of  ( [ m4.8 ] ) must now be inverted ; this will give us an expression for @xmath58 , whose _ inverse laplace transform _ will take us back to the time domain .",
    "a simple glance at the equation suffices however to grasp the unsurmountable difficulties of accomplishing this _",
    "analytically_.    thankfully , though , a _ perturbative _ approach is applicable when the masses of the resonators are small compared to the mass of the whole sphere , i.e. , when the inequality    @xmath71    holds .",
    "i shall henceforth assume that this is the case , as also is with cylindrical bar resonant transducers .",
    "it is shown in appendix  [ app : b ] that the perturbative series happens in ascending powers of @xmath7 , rather than @xmath8 itself , and that the lowest order contribution has the form    @xmath72    where @xmath73 stands for terms of order @xmath74 or smaller . here",
    ", @xmath75 is a _ transfer function matrix _ which relates _ linearly _ the system response @xmath58 to the gw amplitudes @xmath76 , in the usual sense that @xmath59 is given by the _ convolution product _ of the signal @xmath4 with the time domain expression , @xmath77 , of @xmath75 .",
    "the detector is thus seen to act as a _ linear filter _ on the gw signal , whose frequency response is characterised by the properties of @xmath75 .",
    "more specifically , the filter has a number of characteristic frequencies which correspond to the _ imaginary parts of the poles _ of @xmath75 .",
    "as also shown in appendix  [ app : b ] , these frequencies are the symmetric pairs    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the @xmath17-th eigenvalue of the legendre matrix    @xmath80    associated to the multipole ( @xmath66 ) selected for tuning see  ( [ m4.6 ] ) .",
    "these frequency pairs correspond to _ beats _ , typical of resonantly coupled oscillating systems we shall find them again in section  [ sec : hs ] in a particularly illuminating example .",
    "equation  ( [ 6.8 ] ) neatly displays the amplification coefficient @xmath81 of the resonators motion amplitudes , which corresponds to the familiar resonant energy transfer in coupled systems of linear oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the specific form of the transfer function matrix @xmath75 depends both on the selected mode to tune the resonator frequency @xmath82 and on the resonator distribution geometry .",

    "the _ phc _ admits an _ inscribed sphere _ which is tangent to each face at the central point marked in the figure .",
    "it is clearly to this point that a resonator should be attached so as to simulate an as perfect as possible spherical distribution .",

    "tiga _ for comparison .    the criterion leading to the _ phc _ proposal is of course not unique , and alternatives can be considered .",
    "for example , if the 5 faces of a regular icosahedron are selected for sensor mounting ( @xmath123=63.45@xmath124 ) then a four - fold degenerate pair plus a single non - degenerate pair is obtained ; if the resonator parallel is 50@xmath124 or 22.6@xmath124 away from the `` north pole '' then the three frequencies @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 are equally spaced ; etc . the number of choices is virtually infinite if the sphere is not milled into a polyhedric shape  @xcite .",
    "let me finally recall that the complete _ phc _ proposal  @xcite was made with the idea of building an as complete as possible spherical gw antenna , which amounts to making it sensitive at the first _ two _ quadrupole frequencies _ and _ at the first monopole one .",
    "this would take advantage of the good sphere cross section at the second quadrupole harmonic  @xcite , and would enable measuring ( or thresholding ) eventual monopole gw radiation .",

    "one might perhaps say that the _ phc _ gives rise to a sort of `` zeeman splitting '' of the _ tiga _ degenerate frequencies , which can be attributed to an _ axial symmetry breaking _ of that resonator distribution : the _ phc _ mode channels partly split up the otherwise degenerate multiplet into its components .",
    "so far we have made the assumption that the sphere is perfectly symmetric , that the resonators are identical , that their locations on the sphere s surface are ideally accurate , etc .",

    "it is as follows .    as seen in previous sections , the solution to the general equations  ( [ m3.16 ] )",
    "must be given as a _ perturbative _ series expansion in ascending powers of the small quantity @xmath7 .",
    "this is clearly a fact _ not _ related to the system s symmetries , so it will survive symmetry breakings .",

    "perfectly ideal _ spherical detector the system frequencies are given by equations  ( [ 5.2 ] ) .",
    "now , if a small departure from e.g. spherical symmetry is present in the system then we expect that a correspondingly small correction to those equations will be required .",
    "which specific correction to the formula will actually happen can be _ qualitatively _ assessed by a _ consistency _ argument : if symmetry defects are of order @xmath7 then equations  ( [ 5.2 ] ) will be significantly altered in their @xmath7 terms ; if on the other hand such defects are of order @xmath8 or smaller then any modifications to equations  ( [ 5.2 ] ) will be swallowed into the @xmath73 terms , and the more important @xmath7 terms will remain unaffected by the symmetry failure .",
    "one can say in this case that the system is _ robust _ against that symmetry breaking .",
    "more generally , this argument can be extended to see that the only system defects standing a chance to have any influences on lowest order ideal system behaviour are defects of order @xmath7 relative to an ideal configuration .",
    "defects of such order are however _ not necessarily guaranteed _ to be significant , and a specific analysis is required for each concrete parameter in order to see whether or not the system response is _ robust _ against the considered parameter deviations .",

    "an earth based observatory obviously requires a _ suspension mechanism _ for the large sphere . if a _ nodal point _",
    "suspension is e.g.  selected then a diametral _ bore _ has to be drilled across the sphere  @xcite .",

    "this is not really that surprising , though , as m&j explicitly state  @xcite that control of the general experimental conditions in which data were obtained had a certain degree of tolerance , and they actually show satisfaction that @xmath01% coincidence between theory and measurement is comfortably accomplished . but",
    "1% is _ two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath8 _ cf . equation ( [ 8.7]) , so failure to refine our frequency estimates to order @xmath8 is again fully consistent with the accuracy of available real data .",
    "a word on a technical issue is in order .",
    "merkowitz and johnson s equations for the _ tiga _",
    "@xcite are identical to the equations in this paper to lowest order in @xmath8 .",
    "remarkably , though , their reported theoretical estimates of the system frequencies are not quite as accurate as those in table  1  @xcite .",
    "the reason is probably this : in m&j s model these frequencies appear within an algebraic system of 5+@xmath14 linear equations with as many unknowns which has to be solved ; here instead the algebraic system has only @xmath14 equations and unknowns , actually equations  ( [ m3.16 ] ) .",
    "this is a very appreciable difference for the range of values of @xmath14 under consideration .",
    "while the roots for the frequencies _ mathematically _ coincide in both approaches , in actual practice they are _ estimated _ , generally by means of computer programmes .",
    "it is here that problems most likely arise , for the numerical reliability of an algorithm to solve matrix equations normally decreases as the rank of the matrix increases .",
    "we now assess the system sensitivity to small mismatches in resonators masses , locations and frequencies .",
    "if the _ masses _ are slightly non - equal then one can write    @xmath207    where @xmath8 can be defined e.g. as the ratio of the _ average _ resonator mass to the sphere s mass .",
    "it is immediately obvious from equation  ( [ 8.9 ] ) that mass non - uniformities of the resonators only affect the main equations in _ second order _ , since resonator mass non - uniformities result , as we see , in corrections of order @xmath7 to @xmath7 itself , which is the very parameter of the perturbative expansions .",
    "the system is thus clearly _ robust _ to mismatches in the resonator masses of the type  ( [ 8.9 ] ) .",
    "the same happens if the _ locations _ of the resonators have tolerances relative to a _ pre - selected _ distribution .",
    "for let @xmath21 be a set of resonator locations , for example the _ tiga _ or the _ phc _ positions , and let @xmath208 be the real ones , close to the former :    @xmath209    the values @xmath210 determine the eigenvalues @xmath114 in equation  ( [ 5.2 ] ) , and they also appear as arguments to the spherical harmonics in the system response functions of sections  [ sec : srgw][sec : hs ] .",
    "it follows from  ( [ 8.10 ] ) by continuity arguments that    y_lm(*n*_a ) & = & y_lm(*n*_a )",
    "+ o(^1/2 ) [ 8.105.a ] + _a & = & _ a + o(^1/2 ) [ 8.105.b ]    inspection of the equations of sections  [ sec : srgw][sec : hs ] shows that both @xmath114 and @xmath211 _ always _ appear within lowest order terms , and hence that corrections to them of the type  ( [ 8.105 ] ) will affect those terms in _ second order _ again .",
    "we thus conclude that the system is also _ robust _ to small misalignments of the resonators relative to pre - established positions .",
    "the resonator _ frequencies _ may also differ amongst them , so let    @xmath212    to assess the consequences of this , however , we must go back to equation ( [ m3.18 ] ) and see what the coefficients in its series solutions of the type  ( [ 4.11.a ] ) are .",
    "the procedure is very similar to that of section  [ s8.1 ] , and will not be repeated here ; the lowest order coefficient @xmath213 is seen to satisfy the algebraic equation    @xmath214    = 0      \\label{8.12}\\ ] ]    which reduces to  ( [ 5.1 ] ) when all the @xmath215 s vanish , as expected .",
    "this appears to potentially have significant effects on our results to lowest order in @xmath7 , but a more careful consideration of the facts shows that it is probably unrealistic to think of such large tolerances in resonator manufacturing as implied by equation  ( [ 8.11 ] ) in the first place . in the _ tiga _ experiment , for example  @xcite , an error of order @xmath7 would amount to around 50 hz of mistuning between resonators , an absurd figure by all means . in a full scale sphere ( @xmath040 tons , @xmath03 metres in diameter , @xmath0800 hz fundamental quadrupole frequency , @xmath8@xmath010@xmath216 )",
    "the same error would amount to between 5 hz and 10 hz in resonator mistunings for the lowest frequency .",
    "this is probably excessive for a capacitive transducer , but may be realistic for an inductive one . with this exception ,",
    "it is thus more appropriate to consider that resonator mistunings are at least of order @xmath8 .",
    "if this is the case , though , we see once more that the system is quite insensitive to such mistunings .    summing up the results of this section",
    ", one can say that the resonator system dynamics is quite _ robust _ to small ( of order @xmath7 ) changes in its various parameters .",
    "the important exception is of course the effect of suspension drilling , which do result in significant changes relative to the ideally perfect device , but which can be relatively easily calculated .",
    "the theoretical picture is fully supported by experiment , as _ robustness _ in the parameters here considered has been reported in the real device  @xcite .",
    "a spherical gw antenna is a natural multi - mode device with very rich potential capabilities to detect gws on earth .",
    "but such detector is not just a bare sphere , it requires a set of _ motion sensors _ to be practically useful .",
    "it appears that transducers of the _ resonant _ type are the best suited ones for an efficient performance of the detector .",
    "resonators however significantly interact with the sphere , and they affect in particular its frequency spectrum and vibration modes in a specific fashion , which must be properly understood before reliable conclusions can be drawn from the system readout .    the main objective of this paper has been the construction and development of an elaborate theoretical model to describe the joint dynamics of a solid elastic sphere and a set of _ radial motion _",
    "resonators attached to its surface at arbitrary locations , with the purpose to make predictions of the system characteristics and response , in principle with arbitrary mathematical precision .    the solutions to the equations of motion have been shown to be expressible as an ascending series in powers of the small `` coupling constant '' @xmath8 , the ratio of the average resonator mass to the mass of the larger sphere .",
    "the _ lowest order _",
    "approximation corresponds to terms of order @xmath7 and , to this order , previous results  @xcite are recovered .",
    "this , i hope , should contribute to clarify the nature of the approximations inherent in earlier approaches , and to better understand the physical reason for their remarkable accuracy  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the methods of this paper have permitted us to discover that there can be in fact transducer layouts alternative to the highly symmetric _ tiga _ , and having potentially interesting practical properties .",
    "an example is the _ phc _ distribution , which is based on a pentagonally symmetric set of 5 rather than 6 resonators per quadruopole mode sensed .",
    "this transducer distribution has the property that _ mode channels _ can be constructed from the resonators readouts , much in the same way as in the _ tiga _  @xcite . in the _ phc",
    "_ however a new and distinctive characteristic is present : different _ wave amplitudes _ selectively couple to different _ detector modes _ having different frequencies , so that the antenna s mode channels come at different rather than equal frequencies .",
    "phc _ philosophy can be extended to make a _ multi - frequency _ system by using resonators tuned to the first two quadrupole harmonics of the sphere _ and _ to the first monopole , an altogether 11 transducer set .",
    "the assessment of _ symmetry failure _ effects , as well as other parameter departures form ideality , has also been subjected to analysis .",
    "the general scheme is again seen to be very well suited for the purpose , as the theory transparently shows that the system is _ robust _ against relative disturbances of order @xmath8 or smaller in any system parameters , also providing a systematic procedure to assess larger tolerances up to order @xmath7 .",
    "the system is shown to still be robust to tolerances of this order in some of its parameters , whilst it is not to others .",
    "included in the latter group is the effect of spherical symmetry breaking due to system suspension in the laboratory , which causes _ degeneracy lifting _ of the sphere s eigenfrequencies , which split up into multiplets .",
    "a strong point is that , by use of mostly analytic algorithms , it has been possible to accurately reproduce the reportedly measured frequencies of the _ lsu _ prototype antenna  @xcite with the predicted precision of four decimal places .",
    "the also reported robustness of the system to resonator mislocations  @xcite is too in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the perturbative approach here adopted is naturally open to refined analysis of the system response in higher orders in @xmath8 .",
    "for example , one can systematically address the weaker coupling of non - quadrupole modes , etc .",
    "it appears however that such refinements will be largely masked by _",
    "noise _ in a real system , as shown by merkowitz and johnson  @xcite , and this must therefore be considered first .",
    "so the next step is to include noise in the model and see its effect .",
    "stevenson  @xcite has already made some progress in this direction , and partly assessed the characteristics of _ tiga _ and _ phc _ , but more needs to be done since not too high signal - to - noise ratios should realistically be be considered in an actual gw detector . in particular ,",
    "_ mode channels _ are at the basis of noise correlations and dependencies , as well as the errors in gw parameter estimation  @xcite .",
    "i do expect the analytic tools developed in this article to provide a powerful framework to address the fundamental problems of _ noise _ in a spherical gw antenna which , to my knowledge , have not yet received the detailed attention they require .",
    "i am greatly indebted with stephen merkowitz both for his kind supply of the _ tiga _ prototype data , and for continued encouragement and illuminating discussions .",
    "i am also indebted with curt cutler for addressing my attention to an initial error in the general equations of section  2 , and with eugenio coccia for many discussions .",
    "serrano gave me valuable help in some of the calculations of appendix  [ app : b ] below , and this is gratefully acknowledged , too .",
    "i have received financial support from the spanish ministry of education through contract number pb96 - 0384 , and from institut destudis catalans .",
    "where @xmath123 is a suitable label .",
    "it is recalled from reference  @xcite that , in such circumstances , a formal solution can be written down for equation  ( [ 2.1.a ] ) in terms of a _ green function integral _ , whereby the following orthogonal series expansion obtains :          here , @xmath219 and @xmath220 are the eigenfrequencies and associated normalised wave - functions of the free sphere . also , @xmath221 is an abbreviation for a multiple index @xmath44 .",
    "the generic index @xmath222 is a label for the different pieces of interaction happening in the system .",
    "i quote the result of the calculations of the terms needed in this paper :              where the label `` external '' explicitly refers to agents acting upon the system from outside .",
    "two kinds of such external actions are considered in this article : those due to gws and those due to a calibration hammer stroke signal . specifying *",
    "x*=@xmath18 in the lhs of  ( [ m3.6 ] ) and multiply on either side by @xmath21 , the following is readily found :              the following bare sphere responses to gws and hammer strokes ( equations!([1.1 ] ) and  ( [ 2.5 ] ) , respectively ) can be calculated by direct substitution .",
    "the results as best presented as laplace transform domain functions :                                    we must first isolate @xmath237 , then find inverse laplace transforms to revert to time domain quantities . substituting the values of @xmath238 and @xmath69 from  ( [ 6.2.a ] ) and  ( [ 4.85 ] ) into  ( [ a2.1 ] ) we find                  clearly thus , the _ poles _ of @xmath243 must be determined in the first place .",
    "it is immediately clear from equation  ( [ 6.4 ] ) that there are no poles at either @xmath245=0 , or @xmath245=@xmath172 , or @xmath245=@xmath246 , for there are exactly compensated infinities at these locations .",
    "the only possible poles lie at those values of @xmath245 for which the matrix in square brackets in  ( [ 6.4 ] ) is not invertible , and these of course correspond to the zeroes of its determinant , i.e. ,      there are infinitely many roots for equation  ( [ m3.18 ] ) , but _",
    "analytic _ expressions can not be found for them .",
    "_ perturbative _ approximations in terms of the small parameter @xmath8 will thus be applied instead .",
    "it is assumed that          since @xmath8 is a small parameter , the _ denominators _ of the fractions in the different terms in square brackets in  ( [ m4.9 ] ) must be _ quantities of order @xmath8 _ at the root locations for the determinant to vanish at them .",
    "a distinction however arises depending on whether @xmath251 is close to @xmath252 or to the other @xmath253 .",
    "there are accordingly two categories of roots , more precisely :      the coefficients @xmath213 , @xmath206 , ... and @xmath254 , @xmath254 , ... can be calculated recursively , starting form the first , by substitution of the corresponding series expansions into equation  ( [ m4.9 ] ) .",
    "the lowest order terms are easily seen to be given by          respectively",
    ". both equations  ( [ 5.1 ] ) and  ( [ 5.4 ] ) are algebraic eigenvalue equations .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ app : c ] , the matrix @xmath62 has at most @xmath257 non - null positive eigenvalues all the rest up to @xmath14 are identically zero .    as a final step we must evaluate  ( [ 6.6 ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished by standard textbook techniques ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; the algebra is quite straightforward but rather lengthy , and i shall not delve into its details here , but quote only the most interesting results .",
    "it appears that the _ dominant _ contribution to @xmath242 comes from the poles at the locations  ( [ 4.11.a ] ) , whereas all other poles only contribute as higher order corrections ; generically , @xmath242 is seen to have the form                  this appendix presents a few important properties of the matrix @xmath261 for arbitrary @xmath5 and resonator locations @xmath21 ( @xmath17=1,  ,@xmath14 ) which are useful for detailed system resonance characterisation .",
    "equation  ( [ ma.3 ] ) indicates that the _ rank _ of the matrix @xmath264 can not exceed @xmath257 , as there are only @xmath257 kets @xmath266 .",
    "so , if @xmath14@xmath269@xmath257 then it has at least @xmath270 identically null eigenvalues there can be more if some of the @xmath21 s are parallel , as this causes rows ( or columns ) of @xmath264 to be repeated .                in other words ,",
    "@xmath273 are the eigenvalues of the @xmath257@xmath265@xmath257 matrix @xmath276 , which is positive definite because so is the `` scalar product '' @xmath277 .",
