    "this paper arises from our attempt of understanding _ games _ using very foundationally unbiased tools , namely _ algebraic _ and _ coalgebraic methods_. of course , games arising in real life are extremely varied .",
    "they exhibit indeed a perfect example of a _ family resemblance _ in the sense of wittgenstein . furthermore ,",
    "in the past decades people have gone into the habit of describing , more or less conveniently , an extremely wide gamut of interactions and other dynamic phenomena using game - based _",
    "metaphors_. to make matters even more complex when we speak about games many related _ concepts _ and _ notions _ come about , _",
    "e.g. _ _ move _ , _ position _ , _ play _ , _ turn _ , _ winning condition _ , _ payoff function _ , _ tactics _ , _",
    "strategy_. none of these has a universal unique meaning , and according to the various presentations , these concepts are often blurred , sometimes taken as primitive sometimes explained and reduced to one another . and",
    "there are many more _ properties _ , which need to be specified more or less informally before actually having pinned down the kind of game one is interested in ; _",
    "e.g. _ _ perfect knowledge _ , _ zero - sum _ , _ chance _ , _ number _ of players , _ finiteness _ , _",
    "determinacy_.    we think that conway s approach to games provides a very elementary and sufficiently abstract notion of game , which nonetheless is significantly structured , because of the special rle that _ sums _ of games have in conway s theory . and",
    "algebraic - coalgebraic methods provide a convenient conceptual setting for addressing this key concept .    for these reasons , in this paper , we focus on conway games @xcite , that is _ combinatorial games _ , namely no chance 2-player games , the two players being conventionally called _ left _ (",
    "l ) and _ right _ ( r ) .",
    "such games have _ positions _ , and in any position there are rules which restrict l to move to any of certain positions , called the _ left positions _ , while r may similarly move only to certain positions , called the _",
    "right positions_. l and r move in turn , and the game is of _ perfect knowledge _ , _ i.e. _ all positions are public to both players .",
    "the game ends when one of the players has no move , the other player being the winner , the _ payoff _ function yielding only 0 or 1 .",
    "many games played on boards are combinatorial games , _",
    "e.g. _ _ nim _ , _ domineering _ , _ go _ , _ chess_. games , like nim , where for every position both players have the same set of moves , are called _",
    "impartial_. more general games , like domineering , go , chess , where l and r may have different sets of moves are called _",
    "partizan_.    many other notions of games such as those which arise either in set theory , or in automata theory , or in semantics of programming languages can be conveniently encoded in coalgebraic format , see @xcite .",
    "here are some of the most frequently asked questions and corresponding arguments",
    ".    which concept should be taken as primitive : moves or positions ?",
    "we think that one of the strong points of conway s format is that of focusing on positions .",
    "actually , in conway s theory , games , positions and moves essentially coincide .",
    "this approach is more general than others .",
    "of course , the situation is much nicer when positions can be inductively defined as finite sequences of more elementary tokens , namely moves , and hence positions can be viewed as special kinds of plays , or vice versa .    why do we need both a notion of player l and player r , which in turn can be either player i , the first player , or player ii , the respondent ?",
    "conway s choice arises from the fact that , as we pointed out above , a key ingredient in his theory is that of _ sum _ of games . in conway s approach",
    "there is a rigid _ alternation _ of moves between the two players in a sum game , but if we focus on a specific _ component _ of a sum game this might no longer be so : the notions of first player and respondent in a subgame can change many times , and even a strict alternation of moves breaks down .",
    "this is in general why one can only refer meaningfully to player l or r , notwithstanding the fact that any of the two can make an opening move in the game .    of course many games where alternation of players is not rigid",
    "escape a direct encoding in conway s games .",
    "however , in some cases these can be easily encoded in a coalgebraic format , as in some presentations of automata games , where alternation of players is not assumed , see  @xcite .",
    "sometimes , encodings are more roundabout , as in some card games , where the alternation between l and r is determined by a precise criterion , or as in _ normal form _ games , arising in economic theory , and in _ morra _ , where the two players play _ simultaneously_.    conway s approach clearly does not address the issue of a payoff function .",
    "furthermore , since the winning condition is the absence of possible moves , _",
    "i.e. _ no next positions to reach for the player whose turn is on , some encoding is necessary to account for many games where winning or losing depends on the sequence of positions , or moves .",
    "there are many games of this kind .",
    "some are rather silly , such as \" my father is richer than yours  where the two players in turn call a number and who call the largest is the winner . some are less silly such as the one where the two players call two numbers in turn and the first player wins if the sum is equal to , say , 1 mod 4 .",
    "some are extremely important , such as those which arise in set theory , in connection with the axiom of determinacy , or in automata theory , where we have to deal , however , with infinite plays .",
    "this is the last item we address : finite or infinite plays .",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is the study of non - terminating ( non - wellfounded ) games , _",
    "i.e. _ games on which plays are potentially infinite . especially in view of applications ,",
    "potentially infinite interactions are even more important than finite ones .",
    "the importance of games for computer science comes from the fact that they capture in a natural way the notion of _ interaction_. non - wellfounded games model in a faithful way _ reactive processes _ ( operating systems , controllers , communication protocols , etc . ) , that are characterised by their _ non - terminating _ behaviour and perpetual _ interaction _ with their environment .",
    "we take the `` natural '' view that all infinite plays are _ draws _ : on infinite plays , apparently , there are no losers , because each player can respond indefinitely .",
    "this naturally extends the winning condition on conway s games . in this paper , in fact , we shall address only games were all infinite plays are draws , _",
    "i.e. _ `` free '' games in conway s terminology ; we will not deal with games where certain infinite plays are set to be draws and others to be winning for one of the two players , namely `` mixed '' games , or with `` fixed '' games , where infinite plays are all winning for one of the two players , see _",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "since we take non terminating plays to be draws , the notion of _ winning strategy _ on hypergames has to be replaced by that of _ non - losing strategy_.    combinatorial game theory started at the beginning of 1900 with the study of the famous impartial game nim , which became also a movie star in the 60s , in the film ",
    "lanne dernire  marienbad \" by alain resnais and alain robbe - grillet . in the 1930s ,",
    "sprague and grundy generalized the results on nim to all impartial terminating ( _ i.e. _ well - founded ) games , @xcite . in the 1960s ,",
    "berlekamp , conway , guy introduced the theory of partizan games , which first appeared in the book `` on numbers and games '' @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the theory of games is connected to the theory of _ surreal numbers_.    in @xcite , the author focussed essentially on terminating games ,",
    "_ i.e. _ games on which all plays are finite .",
    "non - terminating games were intentionally neglected as ill - formed or trivial games , not interesting for `` busy men '' , and their discussion was confined to a single chapter , inspired by  @xcite .",
    "non - wellfounded games have been later considered in @xcite , chapters 11 - 12 , were free , fixed and mixed games have been discussed . in these chapters ,",
    "the authors also consider an interesting generalization of the grundy - sprague theory , originally due to smith @xcite , which provides natural notions of _ canonical forms_. however , not much attention has yet been paid to generalize the results in @xcite to non - terminating free games .",
    "possibly non - terminating games , which we call _ hypergames _ , can be naturally defined as a _",
    "final coalgebra _ of _ non - wellfounded sets _ ( _ hypersets _ ) , which are the sets of a universe of zermelo - fraenkel satisfying a suitable antifoundation axiom , see @xcite .",
    "this definition generalizes directly the original one in  @xcite , where games are taken to be _ well - founded sets_. once hypergames are defined as a final coalgebra , operations on conway s games , such as _ disjunctive sum _",
    ", can be naturally extended to hypergames , by defining them as _ final morphisms _ into the coalgebra of hypergames .",
    "our approach is different from other approaches in the literature , where games are defined as _",
    "graphs _ or _ pointed graphs_. viewing games as sets ( or points of a final coalgebra ) allows us to abstract away from superficial features of positions and to reason directly up - to graph bisimilarity .",
    "our approach is justified by the fact that all important properties of games in conway s setting , _",
    "e.g. _ existence of winning / non - losing strategies , are invariant under bisimilarity .",
    "our theory of hypergames generalizes the original theory on conway s games of @xcite rather smoothly , but significantly .",
    "two important results in our paper are _ determinacy _ and a _ characterization theorem _ of non - losing strategies on hypergames .",
    "the latter requires ( a non - trivial ) generalization of conway s partial order relation on games to hypergames .    on top of bisimilarity , various notions of _ equivalences _ and _ congruences _ on games and hypergames , arising by looking at strategies , are studied in this paper .",
    "in particular , we investigate various characterizations of the _ greatest congruence _ w.r.t .",
    "sum , refining the _ equideterminacy _ relation .",
    "one interesting result of our investigation is that this congruence coincides on conway s games with the equivalence induced by conway s partial order , and with the ( extended ) _ grundy semantics _ on impartial ( hyper)games . for the class of impartial hypergames , we revisit and extend in a coalgebraic setting the theory of grundy - sprague and smith based on the canonical _ nim games _ , by introducing suitable _",
    "canonical @xmath0-hypergames_. we show that such canonical hypergames can be construed in our setting as a truly _ compositional semantics _ of impartial hypergames , _ fully abstract _",
    "w.r.t . the greatest behavioral congruence .",
    "such semantics is given via a suitable _ generalized grundy function _",
    ", which we define on the whole class of hypergames .",
    "our approach extends other approaches in the literature , where the generalized grundy function is defined only on certain classes of finite cyclic graphs , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "this paper is a revised and extended version of @xcite .",
    "the parts on game and hypergame equivalences , and semantics are new .",
    "the section on impartial hypergames has been substantially revised and extended .",
    "in section  [ tcg ] , we provide a presentation of conway s games as an initial algebra , and we introduce hypergames as a final coalgebra for the same functor .",
    "we discuss determinacy of games , and we prove characterization theorems for winning and non - losing strategies . in section  [ gcon ] ,",

    "we would like to thank the anonymous referees for many useful comments , which helped in improving the paper .",
    "in this section , first we present conway s games as an _ initial algebra _ for a suitable functor , then we introduce hypergames as a _ final coalgebra _ for the same functor .",
    "we take infinite plays to be _ draws _ , and hence conway s notion of _ winning strategy _ has to be generalized by that of _ non - losing strategy_. in this section , we present fundamental results on hypergames , generalizing corresponding results on conway s games .",
    "in particular , we discuss _ determinacy _ of games , _",
    "i.e. _ existence of winning / non - losing strategies , and we prove _ characterization theorems _ for winning and non - losing strategies , which extend in a non - trivial way corresponding results on conway s games .",
    "we recall that conway games are 2-player games , the two players are called _ left _",
    "( l ) and _ right _ ( r ) .",
    "such games have _ positions _ , and in any position @xmath1 there are rules which restrict left to move to any of certain positions , called the _ left positions _ of @xmath1 , while right may similarly move only to certain positions , called the _",
    "right positions _ of @xmath1 .",
    "since we are interested only in the abstract structure of games , we can regard any position @xmath1 as being completely determined by its left and right options , and we shall use the notation @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denote sets of positions .",
    "games are identified with their initial positions , and they can be represented as the tree of all positions generating from the initial one . left and right move in turn , and the game ends when one of the two players does not have any option .",
    "all games are terminating , _",
    "i.e. _ infinite sequences of moves can not arise .",
    "however , there can be possibly infinite moves at any position .",
    "contrary to other notions of games , where only player i ( the player who starts the game ) and player ii are considered , conway distinguishes also between l an r. both the case where l starts the game , _ i.e. _ he acts as player i , while r acts as player ii , and the case where l acts as player ii and r as player i are considered .",
    "this extra complexity allows for a definition of the _ sum operation on games _ , which is central to the theory of conway games , and which is such that the alternance of player i and player ii can break in any single component .",
    "thus the need of considering , at each step , all the possible moves of both l and r on the games where l and r have different sets of moves .",
    "conway s games can be viewed as an _ initial algebra _ of a suitable functor .",
    "although such games are well - founded , in view of extensions to non - wellfounded games , we work in the category @xmath4 of classes of possibly non - wellfounded sets ( hypersets ) and functional classes . , and the category whose objects are the sets with _ hereditary cardinal _ less than @xmath5 , and whose morphisms are the functions with hereditarily cardinal less than @xmath5 .",
    "we recall that the _ hereditary cardinal _ of a set is the cardinality of its transitive closure , namely the cardinality of the downward membership tree which has the given set at the root . ]",

    "then we define the games @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "intuitively , in the game @xmath20 , the player who starts will lose ( independently whether he plays l or r ) , since there are no moves .",

    "finally , the game @xmath27 has a winning strategy for player i , since he has a move to @xmath20 , which is losing for the next player . intuitively , a strategy for a given player is a function which , for any position where the player is next to move , gives , if any , a move for this player .",

    "we plan to pursue this approach .",
    "notice that also in this case some encoding is necessary for representing such games as conway s games to avoid the collapse into the self - singleton @xmath0 .",

    "game semantics has been used for modeling a variety of programming languages and logical systems , and more recently for applications in computer - assisted verification and program analysis , @xcite . in game semantics ,",
    "2-player games are considered , which can be encoded as conway games , despite the different presentation . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",

    "all the operations on games , _",
    "e.g. _ tensor product , linear implication , satisfy this condition .",

    "is presented in  @xcite .",
    "such unifying framework allows us to capture the common nature of games arising in different settings .      in @xcite",
    ", joyal showed how conway ( finite ) games and winning strategies can be endowed with a structure of a traced category .",
    "this provides an alternate account of the contextual equivalence @xmath183 ; namely , existence of a morphism between the corresponding games .",

    "generalizations of joyal s category to hypergames are investigated , based on the new notion _ balanced _ non - losing strategy .",
    "interestingly , when this construction is extended to mixed loopy games ( see  @xcite ) , the categorical equivalence coincides with the loopy equivalence of  @xcite .",
    "however , a categorical construction capturing the contextual equivalence on hypergames is still missing .      in @xcite ,",
    "a simple coalgebraic notion of game is introduced and utilized .",
    "it is folklore that bisimilarity can be defined as a 2-player game , where one player tries to prove bisimilarity , while the other tries to disprove it , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "after some encoding , this game turns out to be a fixed game in the sense of @xcite , where infinite plays are winning for the player who tries to prove bisimilarity .",
    "notice that all our notions and methods could be given on graphs rather than graphs up - to bisimilarity .",
    "the former approach can be convenient in applications , because computing the minimal graph with respect to bisimilarity could be complex , however the latter approach is conceptually more perspicuous .",
    "conway s numbers @xcite amount to conway s games @xmath1 such that no member of @xmath400 is @xmath272 any member of @xmath401 , and all positions of a number are numbers .",
    "thus , once we have defined hypergames and the relations @xmath272 , @xmath207 , we can define the subclass of _ conumbers _ , together with suitable operations extending those on numbers . it would be interesting to investigate the properties of such a class of hypergames .",
    "an intriguing point is whether it is possible to define a partial order , since , as seen in this paper , the relation @xmath272 is not transitive on hypergames .      in this paper , we have considered the ( disjunctive ) sum for building compound games .",
    "however , there are several different ways of combining games , which are analyzed in @xcite , chapter 14 , for the case of finite games",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate such theory of compound games in the setting of hypergames .",

    "in particular , proposition  [ corcon ] gives an alternative efficient characterization of the contextual equivalence for impartial hypergames .",
    "for general partizan hypergames , where we do not have an analogue of grundy semantics , alternative efficient characterizations of contextual equivalence would be even more useful .",
    "this issue is investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the theory of impartial games , as shown in section  [ img ] is quite nice . in particular , impartial games admit canonical forms given by generalized grundy numbers .",
    "a question which naturally arises is about canonical forms for general partizan games . in @xcite ,",
