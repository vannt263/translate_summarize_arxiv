    "these dirac points the quasiparticles obey the massless dirac equation .",
    "in other words , they behave as massless dirac particles leading to a linear dispersion relation @xmath0 ( with the characteristic velocity @xmath1 .",
    "this difference in the nature of the quasiparticles in graphene from conventional 2deg has given rise to a host of new and unusual phenomena such as anomalous quantum hall effects and a @xmath2 berry phase@xcite .",
    "besides the fundamental interest in understanding the electronic properties of graphene there is also serious suggestions that it can serve as the building block for nanoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "since dirac electrons can not be confined by electrostatic potentials due to the klein s paradox it was suggested that magnetic confinement be considered @xcite .",
    "technology for this already exists as the required magnetic field can be created by having ferromagnetic or superconducting layers beneath the substrate @xcite .    in conventional 2deg systems ,",
    "electron transport in the presence of electric@xcite and magnetic modulation@xcite has continued to be an active area of research . in graphene , electrical transport , density of states , bandwidth , thermodynamic properties and collective excitations in the presence of electrical modulation have been considered and theoretical predictions made @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study the affects of the magnetic modulation on the dirac electrons in a graphene monolayer and investigation in this direction has recently been carried out @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the effects of magnetic modulation on the bandwidth ( @xmath3 ) and the density of states ( dos ) of the dirac electrons in graphene .",
    "both these quantities are essential ingredients in studying problems such as electron transport , collective excitations and thermodynamic properties etc .",
    "we consider an external magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene monolayer that is modulated weakly and periodically along one direction .",

    "we employ the landau gauge and write the vector potential as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the period of the modulation . the hamiltonian given by eq .",

    "hence the energy eigenvalues in the presence of modulation are @xmath39 with  @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we observe that the degeneracy of the landau level spectrum of the unmodulated system with respect to @xmath41 is lifted in the presence of modulation with the explicit presence of @xmath41 in @xmath42 the @xmath43 landau level is different from the rest of the levels as the energy of this level vanishes and no modulation induced broadening of this level occurs .",
    "the rest of the landau levels broaden into bands .",
    "the landau bandwidths @xmath44 oscillate as a function of @xmath23 since @xmath38 are oscillatory functions of the index @xmath23 .",
    "before we begin the calculation of the density of states and the bandwidth , it is necessary to discuss the regime of validity of the perturbation theory presented here . for large",
    "@xmath23 the level spacing given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) goes as @xmath45 and the width of the @xmath23th level given by eq.(6 ) goes as @xmath46 there is therefore a value of @xmath23 at which the width becomes equal to the spacing and the perturbation theory is no longer valid .",
    "this occurs when @xmath47 where @xmath48 for a fixed value of @xmath49 . for a fixed electron density and the period of modulation",
    "this suggests the maximum value of the magnetic modulation @xmath6 above which it is necessary to carry out a more sophisticated analysis .    at this stage",
    "we can compare the energy spectrum of dirac electrons in magnetically modulated graphene with both the electrically modulated graphene system and the electrically modulated standard electron system .",
    "the differences are :    @xmath50 the standard electron unperturbed energy eigenvalues depend linearly on the magnetic field and the quantum number @xmath23 while they depend on the square root of both the magnetic field and @xmath23 for the dirac electrons in graphene .",
    "@xmath50 in magnetically modulated graphene , we have the difference of two successive laguerre polynomials while for standard electrons and electrically modulated graphene , we have the sum and average of the two successive laguerre polynomials respectively .",
    "@xmath50 in magnetically modulated graphene the perturbed energy eigenvalues due to modulation are multiplied by the square root of the landau band index @xmath51 that was absent in the expression for the electric case .",
    "these differences will affect the density of states and the band width as we show in the next section .",
    "note that for a weak magnetic modulation case under consideration the quantum numbers @xmath23 can be referred to as the magnetic landau band indices and are equivalent to the landau level quantum number @xmath23 for the unmodulated system . thus the magnetic modulation induced",
    "broadening of energy spectrum is non - uniform , a feature which will be of significance in understanding the behavior of dirac electrons in modulated graphene .",
    "it is well known that in the absence of both the magnetic field and modulation , the dos consists of a series of delta functions at energies equal to @xmath52 .",
    "the addition of a weak spatially periodic magnetic modulation however modifies the former delta function like dos by broadening the singularities at the energies(@xmath52 ) into bands .",
    "the density of states is given by@xmath53 the sum on @xmath23 extends over all occupied landau levels and @xmath54 is area of the sample . by using the energy eigenvalues given in equation ( 7 ) , we can express @xmath55 as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and a factor @xmath58 is due to spin degeneracy .",
    "evaluation of the @xmath59integral in the above equation yields the zero temperature density of states of the density modulated two - dimensional dirac electrons ( dm2dde ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the heaviside unit step function .",
    "here we can see that the one - dimensional van hove singularities of the inverse square - root type exist on either side of the low and high energy edges of the broadened landau bands forming a double peak like structure .",
    "the dimensionless density of state as a function of energy at @xmath62 is shown graphically in fig.(1 ) as a function of @xmath63 , for both the magnetically and electrically modulated graphene using the following parameters @xcite : @xmath64 , @xmath65 m@xmath66 , @xmath67 nm , @xmath68 = 1 mev , and @xmath69 being the fermi wave number of the unmodulated system in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the modulation induced pronounced oscillations are apparent in the weak magnetic field regime , these are the weiss oscillations , superimposed on sdh - type oscillations in the high field regime that are not induced in our results but it is interesting to highlight their characteristics",
    ". the origin of these two types of oscillations can be understood by a closer analytic examination of equation ( 10 ) . in the regime @xmath70 @xmath71 ,",
    "the unit step function vanishes for all but the highest occupied landau band corresponding , say , to the band index @xmath72 .",
    "hence the sum over @xmath23 is trivial .",
    "the analytic structure primarily responsible for the weiss type of oscillations is the function @xmath73 , which jumps periodically from zero ( when the fermi level is above the highest occupied landau band ) to unity ( when the fermi level is contained with in the highest occupied landau band ) , these oscillations are with constant period in @xmath63 similar to the sdh type of oscillations in case of electrically modulated graphene but are out of phase and larger in amplitude@xmath74 on the other hand , modulation of the amplitude of the weiss oscillations displayed in fig .",
    "( 1 ) is largely a consequence of the oscillatory factor @xmath75 , which exhibits commensurability oscillations .",
    "we also find that the minima of the density of states in the magnetically modulated system occur at the maxima of the electrically modulated one with the result that the oscillations in the density of states in the two systems are out of phase .",
    "we also observe that broadening of the landau levels is greater in magnetically modulated graphene compared to electrically modulated graphene .",
    "in addition , van hove singularities forming double peak like structures appear at the low and high energy edges of the broadened landau levels .",
    "to better appreciate the modulation of the amplitude of weiss oscillations we plot the bandwidth as a function of the magnetic field in fig .",
    "the width of the @xmath23th landau level is given as@xmath77\\label{11}%\\ ] ] this is clearly different from the electrically modulated graphene and magnetically modulated standard electron result @xcite .",
    "the bandwidth is plotted for @xmath78 where @xmath79  is the landau level index at the fermi energy similar to the electrically modulated graphene system[to compare @xmath80with @xmath81 for standard electrons in 2deg ] . in fig.(2 ) we present the bandwidths as a function of the magnetic field for both the magnetically modulated graphene and electrically modulated graphene .",
    "the parameters used in the figures are : @xmath64 , @xmath65 m@xmath66 , @xmath67 nm , @xmath68 = 1 mev , and @xmath69 . the bandwidths as a function of the magnetic field for the magnetically modulated graphene and magnetically modulated 2deg are shown in fig.(3 ) .",
    "for the low magnetic fields under consideration , the magnetic modulation induced bandwidth in graphene is out of phase and larger in amplitude ( @xmath82 times larger at magnetic field @xmath83 ) than the electric modulation induced bandwidth in graphene .",
    "in addition , it is in phase but with smaller amplitude ( @xmath84 times smaller at magnetic field @xmath83 ) compared to the magnetically modulate 2deg system.@xcite .",
    "an analysis of the observed change in amplitude of the oscillations in the bandwidths of the three systems considered here is presented in the next section .",
    "the asymptotic expression of bandwidth can be obtained by using the folowing asymptotic expression for the laguerre polynomials in the limit of large @xmath23 as@xmath85 using @xmath86 and substituting the asymptotic expression given by equation ( 12 ) into equation ( 11 ) yields the asymptotic expression for the bandwidth@xmath87@xmath88 where we have rewritten equation ( 11 ) containing @xmath37 in terms of the ratio of the semi - classical orbital radius @xmath89 and the modulation period @xmath14 .    to better understand the increase in amplitude in the magnetically modulated graphene system compared to the electrically modulated one we consider the difference in bandwidths in the two cases @xcite .",
    "important feature is the additional @xmath90 term and a factor of @xmath51 in the perturbed energy eigenvalues for the magnetically modulated case which is absent in the electrically modulated case . for large value of @xmath23",
    ", @xmath90 can be taken to be equal to @xmath91 and the amplitude of the oscillations in the bandwidth of the magnetically modulated graphene becomes smaller due to this factor compared to the magnetically modulated 2deg .",
    "the result is that the bandwidth in the magnetically modulated @xmath92 case is approximately greater by a factor of @xmath93compared to the electrically modulated @xmath94 graphene system at magnetic field strength @xmath4=@xmath95 tesla and it is smaller by a factor of @xmath96 compared to the magnetically modulated ( @xmath97 standard electron gas .",
    "we now give a classical explanation of the asymptotic expression of bandwidth obtained in equation ( 13 ) which is essentially a large @xmath23 expression .",
    "the classical equations of motion along the @xmath98 and @xmath32 directions are @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively , where @xmath101 , is the cyclotron frequency for dirac electrons , @xmath89 is the cyclotron orbit radius in graphene while @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the center coordinates and @xmath104 is the phase factor . note that @xmath81 for standard electrons which is not the same as what we have for dirac electrons given above . now without loss of generality we may take @xmath105 thus the increase in the average energy of the cyclotron motion due to the magnetic modulation is evaluated as@xmath106 where @xmath107 is the period of the orbit .",
    "substituting @xmath108 yields@xmath109 with @xmath110 the bessel function of zero order .",
    "for @xmath111one can approximate the bessel function @xmath112 by a cosine function as follows@xmath113 with the result@xmath114 which is the classical expression for the bandwidth .",
    "this is the same as obtained in equation ( 13 ) in the limit of large @xmath23 which is to be expected as the large @xmath23 limit corresponds to classical results .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the electronic spectrum of graphene subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene layer and a unidirectional periodic magnetic modulation .",
    "we have determined the density of electronic states and the bandwidth of this system .",
    "we have also considered the asymptotic expression of bandwidth and its relation to a classical description . to highlight the effects of modulation on the density of states and bandwidth ,",
    "we have plotted these quantities as a function of the magnetic field for experimentally relevant parameters . we have found that oscillations in the density of states and the bandwidth are out of phase and larger in amplitude compared to the electrically modulated graphene .",
