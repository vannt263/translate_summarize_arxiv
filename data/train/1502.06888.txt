    "in @xcite an explicit construction is given proving that this minimum number is at most @xmath10 .",
    "the best lower bound we know is @xmath11 given by a simple local consideration : the ternary sequences defined by @xmath3-colorings of the @xmath12 edges connected to any fixed vertex should all be different .",
    "there seems to be no reason to believe that such a simple lower bound obtained by a local argument would be sharp .    in this note",
    "we consider an analogous problem involving orientations in place of colorings .",
    "the question here is the minimum number of orientations of the edges of the complete graph @xmath1 such that each triangle becomes cyclically oriented in at least one of them .",
    "a simple lower bound can be given here , too , by just looking at orientations locally : if the condition is satisfied then any pair of the @xmath12 edges attached to a fixed vertex should be oriented in opposite directions ( when viewing them from the common vertex ) in at least one of our orientations .",
    "this gives the lower bound @xmath0 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , in this case , this simple lower bound is sharp .",
    "in fact , even the more general statement of theorem  [ main ] below is true .",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath1 be the complete graph on vertex set @xmath14=\\{0,1,\\dots , n-1\\}$ ] .",

    "the minimum number of orientations in a weakly or increasingly @xmath2-cycling family for @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "[ main ] @xmath21    note that the following corollary immediately follows by setting @xmath22 .",
    "( it was proven as a predecessor of the general theorem by the first author in @xcite . )",
    "note also that @xmath23 is trivial , because all cyclic triangles are `` increasingly cyclic '' .",
    "we denote this common value by @xmath24 .",
    "[ triang ] ( @xcite ) @xmath25    the next section is devoted to the proof of the above theorem , while in section  [ problems ] we discuss some variants of the problem .",
    "all logarithms are meant to be of base @xmath7 .",
    "first we prove the easy fact that the right hand side of ( [ exact ] ) is a lower bound for @xmath19 which obviously bounds @xmath20 from below .",
    "assume we have @xmath26 orientations that satisfy the requirements .",
    "fix a vertex @xmath27 and consider the @xmath12 edges adjacent to @xmath27 .",
    "define a binary sequence of length @xmath28 for each of these edges as follows .",
    "let the @xmath29 bit of the sequence belonging to edge @xmath30 be @xmath5 if the edge is oriented from @xmath27 to @xmath31 in the @xmath32 orientation .",
    "if it is oriented from @xmath31 to @xmath27 then the corresponding bit is @xmath6 .",
    "we claim that at most @xmath33 edges adjacent to @xmath27 can get the same @xmath28-length binary sequence this way .",
    "indeed , if there were @xmath34 edges connecting @xmath27 to @xmath35 and all oriented towards @xmath27 or all oriented away from @xmath27 then we could not have a cyclic @xmath2-cycle on vertices @xmath36 .",
    "this is because that would need a pair of edges @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that one is oriented towards @xmath27 and the other away from @xmath27 .",
    "thus we have at least @xmath39 different binary sequences , so the length of these should be at least @xmath40 .      to prove that the right hand side of ( [ exact ] ) is also an upper bound we give a construction .",

    "we orient the edge @xmath62 from @xmath63 to @xmath64 in the @xmath65th orientation if @xmath66 .",
    "this definition is meaningful since @xmath67 implying @xmath68 , thus @xmath69 for all @xmath65 , that is @xmath66 holds if and only if @xmath70 .",

    "to show that such an @xmath74 exists first note that @xmath75 thus we have @xmath76 . if there was no @xmath65 for which all @xmath71 , then we would have at least one @xmath6-digit at every position making @xmath77 contradicting the previous formula",
    "this contradiction proves the statement . @xmath78",
    "there are several ways to generalize or modify the problems treated above . here",
    "we mention two of them and give some preliminary results .",
    "the following notions often come up in introductory texts on algebraic topology , in particular when introducing simplicial homology cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "( we mention this only to motivate the following definitions , no knowledge of algebraic topology is needed for what follows . )",
    "an ordering of the vertices @xmath79 of an @xmath80-dimensional simplex ( a simplex with @xmath42 vertices ) determines an orientation of the simplex .",
    "two orderings determine the same orientation if an even permutation of the vertices transforms one to the other .",
    "in particular , there are two possible orientations of a simplex , one belonging to odd , the other to even permutations of the indices of vertices .",
    "the orientation defined by the permutation @xmath81 is denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "the opposite orientation is denoted by @xmath83 .",
    "_ example _ : let @xmath84 be a @xmath3-dimensional simplex with vertices @xmath85",
    ". the orderings @xmath86 and @xmath87 belong to the same orientation ( both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are odd permutations ) , while @xmath90 determines the _ opposite _ orientation .",
    "so @xmath91    as usual , the @xmath92-dimensional faces of a @xmath93-dimensional simplex are called its _",
    "facets_.    an orientation @xmath94 of the simplex with vertices @xmath95 _ induces _ the orientation @xmath96 on its facet @xmath97 .",
    "two facets @xmath98 and @xmath99 are oriented _ consistently _ if their orientations can be induced by the same orientation of the original simplex . in other words , orientations @xmath100 and @xmath101 are consistent if they induce opposite orientations on their common face @xmath102 .",
    "_ example _ : let @xmath84 be a @xmath3-dimensional simplex with vertices @xmath85 .",
    "the orientations @xmath103 and @xmath104 are consistent , because the first induces orientation @xmath105 while the second induces @xmath106 on the face @xmath107 of @xmath84 .",
    "note that the above two orientations can be the induced orientations of the orientation @xmath108 .",
    "now the question generalizing the one answered by corollary  [ triang ] is the following : what is the minimum number of orientations of the ( @xmath109-dimensional facets of the @xmath80-dimensional simplices defined by @xmath42-element subsets of @xmath14 $ ] if we want that for every such simplex there is at least one orientation where all its facets are oriented consistently with each other ?    we will use the notation @xmath110 for the number answering the above question .",
    "note that the function @xmath24 of corollary  [ triang ] is just @xmath111 .",
    "_ example _ : for @xmath112 we want to orient the @xmath6-dimensional ( i.e. @xmath7-element ) faces and for each @xmath7-dimensional face ( i.e. triangle ) there is an orientation where all its facets ( the edges ) are oriented consistently .",
    "the latter means that at each vertex of the triangle one of the two edges `` comes in '' and the other `` goes out '' , i.e. the corresponding triangle is cyclically oriented .",
    "corollary  [ triang ] gives the solution for this case .",
    "for @xmath113 we can think about the cyclic orientations of triangles .",
    "a @xmath114-set ( @xmath3-dimesional simplex ) is `` satisfied '' if the @xmath114 triangles it contains get cyclical orientations so that for all @xmath115 pairs formed by these triangles , the common edge of the pair is traversed in the opposite direction by the given cyclic orientations of these neighboring triangles .",
    "we can not answer the previous question completely for @xmath116 but give some estimates .",
    "let us call an orientation of all @xmath80-subsets of @xmath14 $ ] a _ round_. ( that is , it is a function @xmath117\\choose r-1}\\to \\{+,-\\}$ ] . )",
    "our problem is to determine the minimum number of rounds where for each @xmath42-set there is a round where all its @xmath80-subsets are oriented consistently .",
    "[ gnr ] @xmath118    * proof .",
    "* the lower bound is a straightforward generalization of the lower bound in corollary  [ triang ] .",
    "fix an @xmath119-element subset of @xmath14 $ ] , we may assume it is @xmath120 .",
    "for an orientation of each @xmath80-element subset containing @xmath121 we attach a @xmath122 or @xmath123 sign according to whether it induces the orientation @xmath124 or @xmath125 on @xmath121 . since for any two @xmath80-subsets of @xmath14 $ ] containing @xmath121 we must have a round where one of them gets a @xmath122 while the other a @xmath123 sign , we must have at least @xmath126 rounds .",
    "the upper bound is obtained by a simple application of the lovsz local lemma ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . we will orient the @xmath80-subsets of @xmath14 $ ] randomly in @xmath8 rounds .",
    "let @xmath127 be the event that the @xmath80-element subsets of the @xmath32 @xmath42-subset of @xmath14 $ ] are not oriented consistently in any of the @xmath8 rounds .",
    "each @xmath80-subset has two orientations , so for a fixed @xmath42-subset there are @xmath128 possible sets of orientations of its @xmath80-element subsets out of which @xmath7 satisfies our consistency requirement .",
    "so the probability that the requirement is not satisfied for a fixed @xmath42-subset in a given round is @xmath129 . for @xmath8 independent rounds we get @xmath130 .",
    "we want to avoid the events @xmath131 . a pair of events @xmath132 and @xmath133 are mutually independent unless the @xmath134 and @xmath135 @xmath42-subset of @xmath14 $ ] have a common @xmath80-subset .",
    "so in the dependency graph ( formed by the events @xmath136 as vertices two being adjacent if they are not mutually independent ) the degree of every vertex is @xmath137 .",
    "the local lemma says ( its original form is enough for our purposes ) that if @xmath138 then all the bad events can be avoided simultanously .",
    "so we need @xmath139 .",
    "this is satisfied if @xmath140    thus @xmath110 is bounded from above by the smallest @xmath8 satisfying the previous inequality and this proves the claimed upper bound .",
    "@xmath78    note that proposition  [ gnr ] gives @xmath141 , while for @xmath142 it gives @xmath143 as an upper bound .",
    "_ remark 1 .",
    "_ we note that the lower bound in proposition  [ gnr ] , though tight for @xmath112 can not be tight in general .",
    "it is already not so for @xmath113 and @xmath144 .",
    "it is not hard to check that we can not make more than two of the five @xmath114-vertex simplices have their facets oriented consistently in one round .",
    "thus at least @xmath3 rounds are needed , while the lower bound is @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath145      in section  [ thmproof ] we considered only some special @xmath2-cycles of complete graphs , namely those that we called increasing .",
    "this property was crucial when proving the upper bound in theorem  [ main ] .",
    "here we look at the problem , where all @xmath2-cycles are considered .",
    "fix a @xmath146 .",
    "now our question is the following . what is the minimum number of orientations of the edges of @xmath1 needed if we want all the @xmath2-cycles being oriented cyclically in at least one of these orientations",
    "?    we do not know the exact answer to this question for @xmath147 .",

    "@xcite , and obtain some bounds by applying existing results on the latter .

    "an arbitrary orientation of @xmath1 can be encoded by an @xmath168-length sequence of @xmath5 s and @xmath6 s : we attach a @xmath5 or a @xmath6 to every edge depending on whether it is oriented the same way as in @xmath167 or in the opposite direction .",
    "consider a maximum matching of size @xmath169 .",
    "taking an arbitrary orientation of @xmath170 of its edges , it can be extended to a cyclically oriented cycle of length @xmath2 . since this cycle ( or its reverse ) must be present at some orientation we give , the following must be true .",
