    "the observation of bose - einstein condensation @xcite in trapped systems has given rise to an extensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite study of weakly interacting dilute bose - condensed gases .",
    "recent measurements of the elementary excitations @xcite permit the detailed comparison with different theoretical approaches . due to the existence of a number of essential experimental parameters in the trapped systems , e.g. the trap frequencies , scattering length , size of the condensate and temperature , the validity of different approximations depending on these conditions can be examined .",
    "most of the theoretical approaches go back to the 1960s , and were originally derived for spatially homogeneous systems in view of their application to superfluid helium . for their application to the modern bose - einstein condensates in traps",
    "many of these approaches are now being extended to inhomogeneous systems and new approaches are also being developed . in the present paper",
    "we wish to explore such a new approximation scheme .",
    "it is of interest for the modern bose - einstein condensates , because measurements of quasi - homogeneous properties can also be made there @xcite",
    ".    from the theoretical point of view taking the homogeneous limit implies a great simplification . due to the translation symmetry",
    "complicated integral equations reduce to algebraic equations ; essential requirements like a gap - less single - particle spectrum ( which applies only in the homogeneous system ) and the particle number conservation can be expressed in the form of algebraic identities ( _ hugenholtz pines theorem @xcite , generalized ward identities @xcite , compressibility sum - rule @xcite , etc . _ ) . in this form",
    "they provide important tests for the consistency of approximations obtained by selecting certain subsets of feynman diagrams .",
    "having defined an approximation or ` model ' in this way analytical or numerical solution is possible in the spatially homogeneous case without the need for further approximation and all branches of the collective modes - damped , strongly damped and even over - damped ( purely damped ) - can be exhibited .",
    "this is a great advantage over the corresponding calculations for the spatially inhomogeneous system , where further approximations are unavoidable and a similarly complete picture usually can not be attained .    the purpose of this paper is to examine the homogeneous limit of an approximation previously derived for and applied to the inhomogeneous case @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the previous perturbative solution in the case of a harmonic trap @xcite we shall now avoid all further approximations , after setting up the model by selecting the relevant class of feynman diagrams , and derive and study all the excitation branches appearing in the homogeneous model .",
    "furthermore , a number of exact theorems for the homogeneous system will be checked for their validity within our model approach .",
    "for example , in general the poles of the density autocorrelation function and the single - particle green s function must coincide in the bose - condensed region ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "physically this is a consequence of the existence of the order - parameter describing the spontaneously broken gauge - symmetry . in our approximation",
    "the required coincidence of the poles is a direct consequence of the derivation of the model within the dielectric formalism , which is designed to ensure just that .",
    "in contrast to a previous model studied within this formalism ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) and therefore sharing this crucial property , the approximation or model studied here ( and in @xcite for the trapped system ) takes into account the contributions of both the hartree terms _ and _ the fock ( exchange ) terms in the selected graphs . both types of terms are in fact of equal magnitude for the interaction via @xmath0-wave scattering in the experimentally realized dilute weakly interacting bose condensates .    in the next section we present the basic diagrammatic building blocks within the dielectric formalism as an approximation of the full system .",
    "the basic relations of the dielectric formalism are then used to obtain the final density autocorrelation and green s functions determining the excitation spectrum .",
    "we also state there the _ generalized ward identities _ , which are exact relations ensuring the particle number conservation law in cases of spontaneously broken symmetries .",
    "we prove in the appendix that these identities continue to hold in our model , which is a corner - stone of our model - building , because it provides an important consistency check .",
    "a further consistency check is the fulfillment of the compressibility sum - rule , which is demonstrated at the end of section ii . in section [ sec : numerics ] we present the numerical results for the excitation branches at long wavelengths . besides the modes we studied previously for the inhomogeneous system we find additional excitation branches belonging to excitations of mainly the thermal density .",
    "the behavior of these thermal branches will be studied in detail . for weak interaction",
    "they can be accurately approximated by simple analytic expressions , which is done in section [ analytic ] . for stronger interaction",
    "only numerical results are obtainable .",
    "they may suggest explanations for the appearance of the two different branches measured at jila @xcite .",
    "section [ conclusion ] contains some conclusions and further remarks .",
    "here we shall give some necessary background on the so - called ` dielectric formalism ' at finite temperature , which was introduced for analyzing interacting bose - condensed systems @xcite .",
    "an excellent exposition of the formalism and a complete list of references is given by griffin @xcite .",
    "the presence of a bose condensate breaks the gauge - symmetry of the system . as a consequence",
    "the density fluctuation spectra appear in the one particle excitation spectra and vice versa . in the dielectric formalism",
    "the corresponding coupling mechanism is explicitly exhibited .",
    "for sake of simplification we adopt the natural unit @xmath1 throughout the paper . in the bose - condensed phase the usual decomposition of the bose field operator @xmath2 in a condensate wave function @xmath3 and the fluctuation operator @xmath4 with vanishing expectation value @xmath5 is made .",
    "@xmath6 denotes the thermal averaging @xmath7 the condensate wave function can in general be complex , but in the absence of vortices it can be chosen as real , without restriction of generality , and we shall consider this case in the following , for simplicity . the value of the chemical potential @xmath8 is fixed by the average number of particles in the system and is connected with the density of particles in the condensate @xmath9 by requiring @xmath10 imposing @xmath11 we have the additional appearance of anomalous green s functions and it is useful to introduce the matrix green s function @xmath12\\rangle \\label{eq : gfdef}\\ ] ] with field operators in matsubara representation @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to these one particle correlation functions we need the density autocorrelation function : @xmath15\\rangle .",
    "\\label{eq : chidef}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 denotes the density deviation operator .",
    "the exact green s function @xmath17 can be obtained from dyson s equation , i.e. by summing up a geometric series in terms of the green s function @xmath18 of the noninteracting system and the self - energy @xmath19 : @xmath20 the self - energy insertions are by definition _ irreducible _",
    "i.e. _ can not be split into two parts by cutting a single particle line_. different model approximations can be classified by the different kinds of interaction processes included in @xmath19 .    beyond the definition of irreducible quantities it is equally useful to consider the _ proper _ contributions .",
    "diagrams are called proper if they _ can not be split into two parts , each connected to an external vertex or line , by cutting a single interaction line_. they will be denoted by an additional _ tilde_. the total density autocorrelation function @xmath21 can be easily recovered from the proper contributions @xmath22 by just summing up a geometric series : @xmath23 here @xmath24 on the one hand denotes the matsubara - frequency @xcite @xmath25 . on the other hand it is understood that the analytic continuation in @xmath24 from the positive imaginary axis yields the retarded correlation functions , and therefore , if this is our purpose , @xmath24 will in the following always be assumed to lie in the upper half of the complex plane .",
    "@xmath26 denotes the 2-particle t - matrix . in the whole temperature - domain of relevance here",
    "it can be taken as independent of @xmath27 and be expressed by the s - wave scattering length @xmath28 as @xmath29 the importance of the use of the t - matrix in place of the bare interaction was first stressed in this context in beliaev s work @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion of ladder diagrams within the dielectric formalism at finite temperature . )",
    "as is well known since then the use of the 2-particle t - matrix in place of the bare interaction implies that a sum is implicitly performed over the ladder - diagrams of the two - particle interaction , and care has to be taken not to sum up the same class of diagrams again later - on , see e.g. @xcite .    in the dielectric formalism the approximations for @xmath19 and for @xmath22 are related to each other via irreducible vertex functions @xmath30 describing single processes of excitations out of the condensate and of relaxations into the condensate where the energy and momentum transfer is described by an additional out - going interaction line . unlike in the usual green s function approach , where approximations are defined by the diagrams kept in the self - energies and @xmath22 as basic building blocks , in the dielectric formalism an approximation ( or ` model ' ) is defined by introducing building blocks for the proper and irreducible parts of the three quantities @xmath19 , @xmath31 and @xmath30 . in the following we call",
    "_ irreducible and proper _ quantities to be _ regular _ and denote them with an @xmath32 in brackets .",
    "thus we start with specifying the building blocks @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 and expressing all necessary quantities in terms of these three basic quantities , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we begin with the decomposition of the proper quantities @xmath36 and @xmath22 . since a green s function is proper",
    "if and only if all the self - energy insertions are proper we get @xmath37 with @xmath38 $ ] where @xmath39 is the mass of the atoms and we use the abbreviation @xmath40 or -1 if the index @xmath41 takes the values 1 or 2 , respectively .",
    "next we consider the contributions to @xmath22 , which can be written in the form : @xmath42 here we have both , irreducible contributions @xmath33 and contributions which contain at least one proper green s function @xmath43 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath44 and @xmath19 are obtained by summing up the corresponding geometric series : the result for @xmath31 was already given in ( [ chiser2 ] ) , and we can immediately turn to the elements of @xmath19 , which we decompose into their proper and their improper parts as follows : @xmath45    @xmath46 implies that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the sum of the regular diagrams with one external line ( tadpole - diagrams ) .",
    "in addition the conservation laws and corresponding sum rules must be woven into the formalism by ensuring that the approximate expressions for the regular parts still satisfy the exact generalized ward identities .",
    "the identities we want to consider in the following are a consequence of particle number conservation which becomes nontrivial because of the broken gauge - symmetry . within the dielectric formalism",
    "the corresponding ward - identities were first introduced by wong and gould @xcite at temperature @xmath49 and later developed further for finite temperature ( see e.g. @xcite and further references given there ) and used as exact relations between the building - blocks of the dielectric formalism to be satisfied by any consistent approximation .",
    "they can be obtained by inserting the continuity equation @xmath50 into the expressions for various time - ordered correlation functions @xcite,@xcite and read : @xmath51 -\\sqrt{n_c}\\left[{\\sigma}^{(r)}_{1,\\alpha}(\\bbox{q},\\omega ) -{\\sigma}^{(r)}_{2,\\alpha}(\\bbox{q},\\omega)\\right],\\\\ \\label{ward2 } % \\hbar \\omega{\\chi}^{(r)}_{\\rm nn}(\\bbox{q},\\omega)&=&\\frac{|\\bbox{q}|}{m } { \\chi}^{l\\,(r)}_{jn}(\\bbox{q},\\omega)- % \\hbar \\sqrt{n_c}\\left [ { \\lambda}^{(r)}_1(\\bbox{q},\\omega)-{\\lambda}_2^{(r ) } ( \\bbox{q},\\omega)\\right],\\\\ \\label{ward3 } % \\hbar \\omega{\\chi}^{l\\,(r)}_{jn}(\\bbox{q},\\omega)&=&\\frac{|\\bbox{q}|}{m } [ { \\chi}^{l\\,(r)}_{jj}(\\bbox{q},\\omega)+ % \\hbar m(n_c+n_{\\rm th})]- % \\hbar \\sqrt{n_c}\\left [ { \\lambda}^{l\\,(r)}_1(\\bbox{q},\\omega ) -{\\lambda}^{l\\,(r)}_2(\\bbox{q},\\omega)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the demonstration that eqs([ward1]-[ward3 ] ) are satisfied by our model approximation is crucial for ensuring its consistency and given in the appendix .",
    "a further important requirement for the consistency of any approximation is the compressibility sum - rule @xcite @xmath52 to these exact requirements should in our opinion be added a further one , which is a consequence of galilei - invariance and will be discussed in the final section .",
    "we shall now introduce and motivate the particular approximation ( or model ) within the framework of the dielectric formalism we wish to study in this paper .",
    "our aim here is to give a self - consistent hartree - fock theory of the bose - gas , not a perturbation theory in the coupling constant to any given order .",
    "this aim seems legitimate in view of the success of the hartree - fock approximation in many - body physics in general , its limitations as a mean - field theory notwithstanding .",
    "let us first consider the bose - gas in the non - condensed phase .",
    "previously this system was studied in the framework of the dielectric formalism within the hartree - approximation @xcite , which corresponds to the self - consistent theory summing all the bubble - diagrams , but neglecting exchange - contributions in the thermal cloud .. here we would like to go a step further and study the self - consistent hartree - fock theory summing the bubble - diagrams _ and _ the exchange - bubble diagrams . for the uncondensed phase this approximation is , of course , standard , both for the single - particle green s function , where it corresponds to the standard hartree - fock approximation , and for the density response - function , where the summing of the exchange - bubbles is discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the thermal cloud is described by the hartree - fock green s function , which takes the form @xmath53 with @xmath54    with these green s functions the lowest order contributions to the regular density autocorrelation function @xmath55 ( see fig.[fig : chila ] ) are given by the so - called bubble - diagram @xmath56 for the sake of better readability we will use the abbreviations @xmath57 representing the momentum @xmath58 and the matsubara frequency @xmath59 .    in order to treat the exchange - contribution of the two - particle scattering in @xmath60 on the same footing as the direct contribution we have to sum up the diagrams for @xmath55 as in fig.[fig : chila ] , which define a simple geometric series . since the interaction @xmath26 is given here just by a constant the result can be written in terms of the expression ( [ eq : chi0 ] ) in the form @xmath61 when this result for @xmath62 is substituted in eq.([chiser2 ] ) it yields simply @xmath63 i.e. a doubling of the effective coupling constant in the denominator . concerning this treatment",
    "one may legitimately ask , why the hartree - fock green s functions rather than the free - particle green s functions are used for the internal propagators in the bubble and exchange - bubble diagrams .",
    "the reason is one of consistency . without the use of hartree - fock propagators",
    "one could not achieve consistency between statics and dynamics , which is incorporated in the compressibility sum - rule ( [ csr1 ] ) ( nor , as we may add , the consistency with galilei - invariance , as we discuss in the final section ) .",
    "let us now turn to the description of our approximation , or model , also for the condensed phase .",
    "it is defined as the natural extension of the hartree - fock model we use in the uncondensed phase .",
    "thus , for the internal lines we use again the hartree - fock propagators . in this way",
    "we again achieve consistency with the compressibility sum - rule as will be shown later .",
    "furthermore , we again sum up the bubble and exchange - bubble diagrams for all proper quantities , which now also include the proper vertex function @xmath64",
    ". therefore we find @xmath65 which is almost the same expression as found in the uncondensed phase , see also @xcite .    for the proper vertex function @xmath66 the zero - loop diagram is given by the trivial vertex function @xmath67 . by the same reasoning as for @xmath55",
    "we obtain a further geometric series : @xmath68 illustrated in fig.[fig : vertexla ] .",
    "the regular self - energy contributions given by @xmath69 are presented in fig.[fig : selfla ] , where @xmath70 @xmath71    we now simply insert the expressions ( [ tsigma0 ] ) , ( [ tsigma1 ] ) , ( [ tlambda ] ) and ( [ chirser ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ sigmadef ] ) , and obtain straightforwardly the expressions for @xmath72 of our approximation , which are not written out here to conserve space . using our results for @xmath73 and @xmath74 it can be easily checked that the hugenholtz - pines theorem @xcite @xmath75 is satisfied .",
    "the tadpole diagrams are given in fig.[fig : tadp ] .",
    "the condition @xmath76 leads to a relation which can be solved for the chemical potential @xmath77 where we added the chemical potential @xmath78 of the ideal bose - gas , which vanishes in the bose - condensed phase , in order to make the expression valid also in the uncondensed phase , and where we define @xmath79 that @xmath80 is consistently interpreted as the thermal density of the particles in our approximation will be shown by checking the ward - identities and the compressibility sum - rule .",
    "one might raise the question why in the diagrams for @xmath81 and the diagonal elements @xmath82 exchange - ladder terms with two condensate lines at the same interaction line are not also included .",
    "the reason is that because of our use of hartree - fock propagators in the internal lines these exchange - diagrams are already contained in the first - order proper exchange - diagram . as a result the chemical potential @xmath8 in eq.([mu ] )",
    "is simply given by the lowest order terms , but of course these must be evaluated with the hartree - fock propagators .",
    "using the building - blocks we have specified it is now straight - forward to obtain the explicit expressions for the green s function , namely @xmath83 with the denominator @xmath84 the density autocorrelation function can be given similarly as @xmath85 the poles of the green s function and the density autocorrelation function are given by @xmath86 . in the uncondensed phase",
    "we can put @xmath87 and the result ( [ auto ] ) reduces to eq.([ch ] ) with the poles given by @xmath88 .",
    "these dispersion - relations will be analyzed in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "it is manifest from our explicit expressions that the poles of the green s function in the bose - condensed phase are indeed the same as those of the density autocorrelation function . on the other hand , because of @xmath87 the poles of @xmath89 and @xmath90 become different in the uncondensed phase : the factor @xmath91 then cancels from the numerator and denominator of @xmath90 and the remaining single - particle poles at @xmath92 are those of the free bose - gas .",
    "it is important to remark here , that summing up the bubble and exchange - bubble diagrams , after a suitable rearrangement of the resulting expressions , has not lead us to terms of higher than the first loop order in the numerator and denominator , both in the condensed and the uncondensed phase , if note is made of the fact that the quantity @xmath93 is of zeroth loop - order in the condensed phase .",
    "however , our treatment is not a perturbation theory in the coupling g , i.e. loop - order is not the same as order in the coupling @xmath26 , because a self - consistently determined propagator , namely the hartree - fock propagator , is used in the bubble - diagram defining @xmath94 , which depends itself on @xmath26 .",
    "rather , we claim that the theory given here is the self - consistent hartree - fock theory also in the condensed phase .",
    "this claim is based on the fact that the theory satisfies all consistency checks , namely the identity of the poles of the greens- and density response - function , the ward - identities , which also contain the f - sum rule , the compressibility sum - rule , and of course the hugenholtz - pines theorem .",
    "in addition it satisfies a consistency check derived from galilei - invariance , as discussed in the final section .",
    "it should be noted that , apart from the hugenholtz - pines theorem , none of these consistency checks are satisfied in the usual popov approximation .",
    "( but it is interesting to remark that they can also be shown to be satisfied in the simpler hartree - model @xcite within the dielectric formalism , for which our treatment therefore provides the logical consistent extension which includes exchange ) .",
    "surprisingly for us the comparison of our result ( [ auto ] ) for the density autocorrelation function with corresponding results given by minguzzi and tosi @xcite yields complete agreement .",
    "this is nontrivial , since the theories are formulated in quite different ways and arrive at the result for the density autocorrelation function in very different manners and after considerable rearrangements .",
    "it is interesting to learn from this agreement that the theory formulated by minguzzi and tosi @xcite has a foundation within the dielectric formalism and permits a description in terms of the feynman diagrams from which we derived our results .",
    "this is a strong hint that there is just one consistent hartree - fock theory not only in the uncondensed but also in the condensed phase .",
    "an obvious advantage of the dielectric formalism over the linear response theory used in @xcite is the fact that besides the density response - function the green s function is also obtained explicitly as displayed above , which would be outside the scope of the theory given in @xcite . with the green s function",
    "our theory gives explicit expressions for autocorrelation functions of amplitude and phase of the order - parameter .",
    "the former equals @xmath95 , the latter @xmath96 , with @xmath97    we still need to evaluate the thermal density @xmath80 , the chemical potential @xmath8 and @xmath98 .",

    "the effective chemical potential @xmath106 coincides with the chemical potential @xmath78 of the ideal bose - gas . for the condensed phase ,",
    "using @xmath107 , the effective chemical potential is @xmath108 and @xmath109 . for a given total density @xmath110 the equation of state in the condensed phase",
    "is therefore given by the implicit equation , which is equivalent to the equation of state derived first by huang et al .",

    "amounts to @xmath120 of the total density , so it can not be neglected by any means .",
    "the coexisting values of the total density for given values of the chemical potential in the two - phase region have to be determined from the maxwell - construction and will be discussed below .",
    "let us first consider the correlation functions in the static limit , i.e. at @xmath121 , in more detail .",
    "we find with or without condensate @xmath122 with a condensate @xmath123 and this correlation function displays the usual infrared singularity @xmath124 associated to the spontaneously broken gauge - symmetry . for the amplitude autocorrelation function at @xmath121 we obtain in the uncondensed and the condensed phase , respectively , and displaying also the asymptotics for @xmath125 , @xmath126 with @xmath127    we examine the stability of the model below @xmath114 .",

    "for small @xmath193 one can expand @xmath196    when we ask for solutions of ( [ sound.below],[sound.above ] ) , we are looking for eigen - modes of the system , which , for physical reasons , have to decay ( rather than grow ) exponentially and the poles we look for have therefore to be located in the lower complex half - plane . in eq .",
    "( [ sound.below ] ) the analytical continuation of the integral ( [ chi.dimlos ] ) from the upper to the lower complex half - plane of @xmath0 has therefore to be used .",
    "with this explicit representation of the response function we are now able to determine the solutions of ( [ sound.below ] ) and of ( [ sound.above ] ) below and above the phase transition numerically . since the terms in the sum in ( [ chi.resd ] ) decay only as @xmath197 the sum converges very slowly and it is not possible to cut the sum at some large finite @xmath198 instead we can use a continuum approximation integrating over all terms in the range @xmath199 as a numerical check we have reproduced all our data with the alternative representation of the response function by performing integral ( [ chi.dimlos ] ) numerically with @xmath0 in the lower complex half - plane and subtracting the term for the analytical continuation : @xmath200 the numerical solutions are plotted in figs.[v0=0.1.hf],[v0=0.3.hf ] .",
    "these figures show the real- and imaginary parts of @xmath183 for various branches of damped modes as a function of temperature above and below the phase - transition , and how these branches bifurcate as the poles corresponding to these modes move in the complex plane . for the weakest interaction strength , shown in fig.[v0=0.1.hf ] ,",
    "various approximations are possible to permit an analytical understanding of most of the structure shown .",
    "this will be described in the following section . here",
    "we discuss the numerical results shown in the figures .",
    "we use the condensation temperature @xmath201 of the ideal bose - gas as a convenient energy - scale near which the phase - transition occurs .",
    "let us begin with the case of weak interaction with @xmath202 for our two models , shown in fig.[v0=0.1.hf ] . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath203 we typically get complex solutions for @xmath183 with @xmath204 and with finite real and imaginary part . then , at a certain temperature @xmath205 , which is above @xmath114 for very weak interaction but moves below @xmath114 for stronger ones as seen in fig .",
    "[ v0=0.3.hf ] , the real part of the velocity of sound vanishes , the mode becomes over - damped below @xmath114 , and the imaginary part bifurcates into two different branches , as seen in fig .",
    "[ v0=0.1.hf ] .",
    "density - waves with a certain wave vector no longer propagate , but decay as a mere relaxation with two different decay - rates describing a short - time decay and a long - time decay .",
    "both damping - rates are proportional to the wave vector .",
    "an analytical understanding of the bifurcation based on a suitable approximation to the response function for large arguments @xmath206 will be provided in the next section .    the finite jump ( [ ncond.disc ] ) of the condensate density at the first order transition in the model results in discontinuities of the two purely imaginary thermal branches .",
    "the discontinuity in the lower branch is visible in fig .",
    "[ v0=0.1.hf ] , while in the upper branch it is very small and not discernible . even at lower temperatures",
    "this upper branch hardly deviates from the result above @xmath114 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ v0=0.1.hf ] .",
    "the reason for this is that for weak interaction ( [ c.im.upper ] ) also implies @xmath207 , and the dispersion - relation ( [ sound.below ] ) below @xmath114 reduces to the equation ( [ sound.above ] ) above @xmath208 .",
    "so @xmath183 from ( [ c.im.upper ] ) turns out to be also a solution of ( [ sound.below ] ) below @xmath114 and can be seen in fig .",
    "[ v0=0.1.hf ] as the solution independent of the temperature for the whole condensed region .    below the phase - transition",
    "a new propagating branch with non - vanishing real part of @xmath183 appears , which is the bogoliubov mode and , as discussed in the next section , has a velocity close to @xmath209 , as is also visible in fig.[v0=0.1.hf ] . in the units chosen in the figures this bogoliubov branch for @xmath210 converges to the value @xmath211 .",
    "let us now turn to the case of slightly stronger interaction in fig .",
    "[ v0=0.3.hf ] .",
    "the most remarkable new feature compared to the very weakly interacting case is , that the bifurcation of the thermal branch occurs now at some temperature @xmath205 below the phase transition .",
    "we can see the real parts of the propagating thermal branch and the bogoliubov branch crossing at some temperature between @xmath205 and @xmath114 . though the mode described by the thermal branch is still propagating it is strongly damped , its real part being smaller than its imaginary part .",
    "the bifurcation of the bogoliubov branch near @xmath114 does not occur anymore , the bogoliubov sound remains propagating at the phase transition .",
    "again the smaller of the two damping rates which have bifurcated from the thermal branch is still larger than the damping of the bogoliubov sound .",
    "however , the discontinuity in the condensate density at the phase transition already amounts to @xmath212 of the total density , so this behavior near @xmath114 has only a restricted physical meaning .",
    "the bifurcation shown in fig.[v0=0.1.hf ] can be understood by the following approximation to the response function : for large arguments @xmath206 we can expand the integrand in ( [ chi.num ] ) in powers of @xmath213 and get as the dominant behavior for large @xmath214 @xmath215 for weak interaction @xmath216 and for @xmath217 the real part of @xmath0 is much smaller than the imaginary part , as seen numerically , and the full response function can be approximated by the second term in ( [ chi.ssgg ] ) only .",
    "this approximate response function , taken as a function of a purely imaginary argument , is a real convex function , and only if condition ( [ sound.above ] ) is fulfilled at its minimum , a purely imaginary solution is possible .",
    "from the temperature dependence of the chemical potential above @xmath114 it follows , that this is possible only below some temperature @xmath218 which one can determine as @xmath219 for @xmath220 for example .",
    "above @xmath205 the approximate response function gives rise to the characteristic growth of the real part of @xmath183 , see fig .",
    "[ v0=0.1.hf ] . in the limit",
    "@xmath206 we even can approximate @xmath221 and the simple solution independent of the temperature follows as @xmath222 this can be seen as the upper branch of the bifurcated imaginary part for small temperatures in fig .",
    "[ v0=0.1.hf ] .",
    "the lower branch decreases linearly with temperature and finally enters the opposite region with @xmath223 . in this region",
    "the behavior can be described by a different approximation of the response function @xcite .",
    "the first three leading terms of ( [ chi.resd ] ) in @xmath224 ordered by magnitude can be summarized as @xmath225    from the dominant , first two terms the approximate solution in the limiting case @xmath226 above the phase transition follows as @xmath227 except at high temperatures this expression agrees very well with the numerically determined data in figs.[v0=0.1.hf ] . the behavior linear in @xmath228 is given by the first term in the numerator , since the chemical potential can be expanded as @xmath229 , the offset is given by the second term in the numerator .",
    "finally we note , that the bifurcations discussed above can also be followed analytically if use is made of the approximation ( [ chi.ssll ] ) for the density response function .",
    "let us turn to the region below @xmath114 and show that in both of our models we have a branch with @xmath183 very close to @xmath209 . in the limit @xmath226 we can use again the approximate response function ( [ chi.ssll ] ) . according to the bogoliubov theory at vanishing temperature sound propagates with the bogoliubov speed @xmath209 . using this in ( [ chi.ssll ] ) we see , that @xmath230 is of the order @xmath231 with @xmath232 .",
    "so with @xmath233 it follows from ( [ sound.below ] ) , that one solution is near the bogoliubov speed of sound @xmath234 .",
    "the corresponding numerically determined solutions can be seen in fig.[v0=0.1.hf ]    being close to @xmath209 the bogoliubov - branch can be determined analytically from perturbation theory . to this purpose",
    "we consider the right hand side in ( [ sound.below ] ) with the response function ( [ chi.ssll ] ) as a perturbation to the bogoliubov speed of sound @xmath235 .",
    "we get the complex correction @xmath236 the first term gives the leading order in @xmath26 and is proportional to the temperature .",
    "the damping rate of bogoliubov sound waves with wave vector @xmath237 due to this term is @xmath238 with the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath28 from @xmath239 this damping rate is of the same order as the damping previously determined in @xcite , which only differs in the numerical prefactor of one instead of @xmath240 and also agrees approximately with the damping rate in the beliaev approximation extended to finite temperatures by _ shi and griffin _",
    "@xcite , but obtained also by other methods in the intermediate temperature region @xcite .",
    "the difference is that in ( [ dampf.hf ] ) the prefactor @xmath241 should be replaced by @xmath242 . for the frequency shift",
    "we obtain @xmath243 , a result which is in good agreement with a result of fedichev and shlyapnikov @xcite , who obtain @xmath244 , and also of giorgini @xcite , who gets @xmath245 this shift , which is negative and linear in the temperature , reduces the speed of sound compared to the bogoliubov approximation .",
    "these results are in agreement with the measurements of temperature dependent frequency shifts of discrete modes @xcite , which were found to have negative sign for the @xmath246 mode , and also for the @xmath247 mode at intermediate temperatures . using the full response function and taking the inhomogeneity of the system into account an explanation of these frequency shifts and the damping rates",
    "was already given in @xcite .",
    "let us briefly summarize the results of this paper and then draw some further conclusions .",
    "we have presented here within the framework of the dielectric formalism a consistent microscopic model of the weakly interacting bose - gas including exchange .",
    "we have shown that a consistent treatment of exchange processes is achieved by using hartree - fock propagators for the internal lines of diagrams and summing up the _ same _ classes of diagrams for _ different _ quantities . as far as the density correlation function",
    "is concerned we obtain results which , on the general level , are equivalent to earlier reults by minguzzi and tosi @xcite .",
    "this agreement is nontrivial , because our starting point is quite different from their s .",
    "however our treatment is more general than that in @xcite because it also gives the single - particle green s functions , which by construction have the same poles as the density - correlation function , displaying a gapless single - particle spectrum , i.e. satisfying the hugenholtz - pines theorem .",
    "the agreement of our result for the density correlation with that in @xcite uncovers the diagrammatical basis of the equations written down there and therefore opens up the possibility for future systematic improvements .",
    "the rational basis of our model or approximation is its consistency with general requirements , which are very nontrivial to be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "thus we demonstrated explicitely that the compressibility sum - rule is satisfied , ensuring the consistency between statics and dynamics of the model ; and the ward - identities , were checked , ensuring the consistency between particle number conservation ( and the f sum - rule ) and the spontaneously broken gauge - symmetry .    to these consistency checks , which were in detail discussed , a further one",
    "may be added which we have not yet discussed , but which we deem to be of no less importance , because it derives from a further symmetry of the system - galilei - invariance .",
    "galilei - invariance is most easily considered in a spatially confined system , because it then simply implies the free motion of the center of mass , if the confined system as a whole moves . in bose - condensed systems",
    "spatial confinement is naturally achieved by imposing an external , but spatially fixed trapping potential .",
    "the system can then not move as a whole , but can still move in the external potential .",
    "the motion of the center of mass is then no longer free , and in general it is not even separable from the other degrees of freedom in quantum mechanics .",
    "however in the special case of an external harmonic potential the center of mass motion is separable and is simply a harmonic oscillation in the external potential .",
    "this fact is the content of the kohn - theorem @xcite . in the limit where the spring - constants of the external harmonic potential are sent to zero the harmonic oscillation of the center of mass tends to the free motion required by galilei - invariance",
    "therefore , if the system satisfies the kohn - theorem in a fixed external harmonic potential ( possibly with infinitesimal spring - constants ) , galilei - invariance is ensured if the external potential is switched off .",
    "we wish to point out here , that in addititon to the other consistency - checks already discussed , also this check is passed by the approximate model discussed in the present paper .",
    "this has been shown in @xcite , where the fulfillment of the kohn - theorem within the approximate model was explicitely demonstrated .",
    "it can be seen from the proof given there that this test is quite sensitive and would e.g. fail if .",
    "another definition of @xmath80 would be chosen , e.g. by using in the definition the full green s function rather than the hartree - fock propagators , or if propagators different from the hartree - fock propagators would be used in the internal lines .",
    "let us briefly discuss also the limits of validity of our treatment .",
    "the theory we have given is a mean - field theory and therefore restricted to the collisionless domain @xmath248 , where @xmath249 is the mean collisiontime .",
    "it is also restricted to sufficiently high temperature @xmath250 , because in the low - temperature domain @xmath251 scattering processes at wave - number smaller than the inverse bogoliubov coherence length @xmath252 make an important contribution , and our use of the hartree - fock propagator for the internal lines would lead to a qualitatively wrong temperature - dependence .",
    "the mean - field character of our theory also prohibits its application close to the phase transition , which occurs at a temperature close to @xmath114 for the weakly interacting bose - gas .",
    "the ginzburg - criterion for the validity of a mean - field description here takes the form @xcite @xmath253 . indeed ,",
    "our model , if extrapolated to temperatures near @xmath114 , would predict a first - order transition within the transition - region specified by this criterion , but since this is clearly outside the limit of validity , it is of course not a prediction of the model . for some purposes , like following the fate of the various excitation branches as the phase - transition temperature",
    "is crossed , it would certainly be nice to have also a mean - field model including exchange and satisfying all the consistency checks we have discussed _ and _ also giving a second - order mean - field transition at a critical temperature near that of the ideal bose - gas .",
    "this goal , however , is not met by the approximation we have discussed here , and further work may be required to achieve it eventually .    in summary ,",
    "the results obtained here identify the model we introduce as a rather satisfactory while still manageable microscopic description of a weakly interacting bose - gas in the collisionless regime , except at very low temperatures and very near to @xmath114 .",
    "besides checking in detail the consistency of our approximations , we have presented and discussed a detailed numerical and partially also analytical study of the dispersion relation of the _ joint _ single - particle and density fluctuation modes below and the _ separate _ single - particle and density fluctuation modes above @xmath114 .",
    "the results for the complex ratio @xmath254 have been summarized in figs.[v0=0.1.hf],[v0=0.3.hf ] .",
    "the dispersion relation found depends qualitatively on the strength of the coupling . if the latter is weak like in fig.[v0=0.1.hf ] , then purely damped modes exist from a region above @xmath114 down to the low - temperature regime , besides the propagating and weakly damped bogoliubov - mode which exists only below @xmath114 . for stronger coupling , like in fig.[v0=0.3.hf ] , there is a propagating , damped mode from above @xmath114 down to a finite temperature @xmath205 somewhat below @xmath114 . only below @xmath205",
    "this mode also becomes purely overdamped , like for the weak - coupling case .",
    "the bogoliubov mode in the condensed phase exists also for strong coupling , only with higher frequency and larger damping .",
    "though the main purpose of the present work has been a theory for the homogeneous bose gas it is interesting to contrast the results presented here with the measurements of and theoretical results for the temperature dependence of discrete frequencies for trapped condensates @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the results for the real part of the velocity of sound in fig.[v0=0.3.hf ] are similar to measurements of the frequency shifts and damping - rates for the @xmath247 and @xmath246 modes at intermediate temperatures @xcite .",
    "the measured frequency of the @xmath247 mode was found to first decrease with increasing temperatures for low temperatures , but then it suddenly increased again at higher temperatures @xmath255 it was suggested , that the increase might be due to the crossing of the bogoliubov mode with another mode of the thermal cloud @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "such a second mode was actually found in @xcite,@xcite using a solution of the kinetic equations .",
    "here we also found a second branch of the velocity of sound for the homogeneous system , see fig.[v0=0.3.hf ] , but it is found to be strongly damped , in qualitative distinction from what is found in the trapped system .",
    "however , a measurement along the lines of @xcite , testing the local properties of the bose - gas , could actually check our results for the thermal branch of the collective modes in the homogeneous system .",
    "in fact it was already remarked in @xcite that above @xmath114 there was no clear evidence for a propagating sound - wave , which is in qualitative agreement with the non - propagating nature of the collective mode above @xmath114 which we have found in the present paper .",
    "the research results were attained with the assistance of the humboldt research award to one of us ( p.sz . ) and through support by a project of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and the hungarian academy of sciences under grant no 130 .",
    "support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft within its sonderforschungsbereich 237 unordnung und grosse fluktuationen , and by the hungarian national research foundation under grant no otka t029552 is also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we wish to show here that the identities ( [ ward1]-[ward3 ] ) are indeed fulfilled in our model approximations .",
    "the specific choice of the building blocks for the vertex functions @xmath256 and @xmath257 simplifies the structure of these identities considerably .",
    "first the second term on the right hand side of the second ward identity vanishes due to the agreement of @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "second , rewriting @xmath256 and @xmath257 in the forms : @xmath260 ( compare fig.[fig : vertexla ] and fig.[fig : curvertla ] ) we obtain @xmath261= % \\hbar \\sqrt{n_c}\\,[{\\lambda}^{l\\,0}_1-{\\lambda}^{l\\,0}_2]= % \\hbar    @xmath262.\\ ] ] furthermore , in the first ward identity the terms @xmath263 and @xmath264 appearing in the bracket on the right hand side are cancelled by the contributions @xmath265 and @xmath266 respectively . since the contributions of @xmath267 are independent of @xmath41 and @xmath268 the difference @xmath269 vanishes .",
    "additionally we note that the differences of the gross - pitaevskii self - energies are given by @xmath270 resulting in a simplified expression of the first ward identity @xmath271 recalling the decomposition in eqs .",
    "( [ tlam],[tlaml ] ) and dividing @xmath272 and @xmath273 by their common factor @xmath274 the proof of the first and second ward identities is reduced to the check of the relation @xmath275 using the decompositions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chila ] and [ fig : curchila ] ) @xmath276 we just have to demonstrate the equivalent relation @xmath277 , which can be done in a similar way as in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) by replacing the free - particle green s functions used there by the hartree - fock green s functions @xmath112 of eq.([ghf ] ) . in completing this proof",
    "we only need an energy dispersion law of the form @xmath278 $ ] valid for the free - particle green s function and the hartree - fock green s function used by us .",
    "the third ward identity can be simplified by the decompositions ( fig .",

    "<S> the dielectric formalism is used to set up an approximate description of a spatially homogeneous weakly interacting bose gas in the collision - less regime , which is both conserving and gap - less , and has coinciding poles of the single - particle green s function and the density autocorrelation function in the bose - condensed regime . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation takes into account the direct and the exchange interaction in a consistent way . </S>",
    "<S> the fulfillment of the generalized ward identities related to the conservation of particle - number and the breaking of the gauge - symmetry is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics at long wavelengths is considered in detail below and above the phase - transition , numerically and in certain limits also in analytical approximations . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit form of the density autocorrelation function and the green s function is exhibited and discussed . </S>"
