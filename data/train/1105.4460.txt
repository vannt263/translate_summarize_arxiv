    "recent analyses of the neutrino oscillation data @xcite indicate that the tribimaximal mixing ( tbm ) pattern for three flavors of neutrinos @xcite can be regarded as the zeroth order leptonic mixing matrix @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a diagonal matrix of phases for the majorana neutrino .",
    "however , properties related to the leptonic violation remain completely unknown yet .",
    "the large values of the solar and atmospheric mixing angles , which may be suggestive of a new flavor symmetry in the lepton sector , are entriely different from the quark mixing ones .",
    "the structure of both charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices could be dedicated by a flavor symmetry , for example , the @xmath9 discrete symmetry , which will tell us something about the charged fermion and neutrino mixings .",
    "if there exists such a flavor symmetry in nature , the tbm pattern for the neutrino mixing matrix may come out in a natural way .",
    "it is well known that there are no sizable effects on the observables from the renormalization group running for the hierarchical mass spectrum in the standard model  @xcite .   in the minimal supersymmetric model ,",
    "all three mixing angles may change significantly  @xcite . ] hence , corrections to the tribimaximal neutrino mixing from renormalization group effects running down from the seesaw scale are negligible in the standard model .",
    "the so - called pmns ( pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ) leptonic mixing matrix depends generally on the charged lepton sector whose diagonalization leads to a charged lepton mixing matrix @xmath10 which should be combined with the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath11 ; that is , @xmath12 in the charged fermion ( quarks and charged leptons ) sector , there is a qualitative feature which distinguishes the neutrino sector from the charged fermion one .",
    "the mass spectrum of the charged leptons exhibits a similar hierarchical pattern as that of the down - type quarks , unlike that of the up - type quarks which shows a much stronger hierarchical pattern .",
    "for example , in terms of the cabbibo angle @xmath13 , the fermion masses scale as  @xmath14 ,  @xmath15   and  @xmath16 .",
    "this may lead to two implications : ( i ) the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite is mainly governed by the down - type quark mixing matrix , and ( ii ) the charged lepton mixing matrix is similar to that of the down - type quark one .",
    "therefore , we shall assume that ( i ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is associated with the diagonalization of the down - type ( up - type ) quark mass matrix and @xmath20 is a @xmath21 unit matrix , and ( ii ) the charged lepton mixing matrix @xmath22 has the same structure as the ckm matrix , @xmath23 .",
    "very recently , a non - vanishing mixing angle @xmath24 has been reported firstly from daya bay and reno collaborations  @xcite with the results given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the previous data from the t2k , minos and double chooz collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results of the non - zero @xmath24 indicate that the tbm pattern for the neutrino mixing should be modified .",
    "moreover , properties related to the leptonic cp violation remain completely unknown yet .    in this work",
    ", we shall assume a neutrino mixing matrix in the tbm form , @xmath27 we will neglect possible corrections to @xmath28 from higher dimensional operators and from renormalization group effects",
    ". then we make a simple _ ansatz _ on the charged lepton mixing matrix @xmath29 , namely , we assume that @xmath29 has the same structure as the qin - ma ( qm ) parametrization of the quark mixing matrix , which is a wolfenstein - like parametrization and can be expanded in terms of the small parameter @xmath30 . unlike the original wolfenstein parametrization , the qm one has the advantage that its _ cp_-odd phase @xmath31 is manifested in the parametrization and approximately maximal , i.e. @xmath32 . as we shall see blow , this is crucial for a viable neutrino phenomenology .",
    "it turns out that the pmns leptonic mixing matrix is identical to the tbm matrix plus some small corrections arising from the charged mixing matrix @xmath29 expanded in terms of the small parameter @xmath30 .  , where the bimaximal matrix @xmath33 leads to @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "] schematically , @xmath36 consequently , not only the solar and atmospheric mixing angles given by the tbm remain valid but also the reactor mixing angle and the dirac phase can be deduced from the above consideration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the parameterizations of quark and lepton mixing matrices and pick up the one suitable for our purpose in this work . after making an ansatz on the charged lepton mixing matrix we study the low - energy neutrino phenomenology and emphasize the new results on the reactor neutrino mixing angle and the _ cp_-odd phase in sec .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in the weak eigenstate basis , the lagrangian relevant to the lepton sector reads @xmath37 when diagonalizing the neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we can rotate the fermion fields from the weak eigenstates to the mass eigenstates , @xmath40 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath66 therefore , the -odd phase is approximately maximal in the sense that @xmath67 . because of the freedom of the phase redefinition for the quark fields , we have shown in @xcite that the qm parametrization is indeed equivalent to the wolfenstein one   and the qm parameters @xmath68 are shown in @xcite . ] and pointed out that @xmath69 where the three angles @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the unitarity triangle are defined by @xmath73 and they satisfy the relation @xmath74 . since @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 inferred from the current data @xcite , the phase @xmath31 in the qm parametrization is thus very close to @xmath78 .",

    ", we shall consider a particular qm parametrization obtained by rephasing @xmath82 and @xmath83 quark fields : @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 as we will show in the next section , it will have very interesting implications to the lepton sector .",
    "let us now discuss the low energy neutrino phenomenology with an _ ansatz _ that the charged lepton mixing matrix @xmath22 has the similar expression to the qm parametrization given by eq .",

    "nevertheless , we shall assume that @xmath30 is a small parameter and that @xmath31 is of order @xmath78 . as we will see below , this matrix accounts for the small deviation of the pmns matrix from the tbm pattern .",
    "we have emphasized in @xcite that the phases of the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath10 play a key role for a viable neutrino phenomenology .",
    "especially , we have found that the solar mixing angle @xmath50 depends strongly on the phase of the element @xmath89 .",
