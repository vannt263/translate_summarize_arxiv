    "ngc 6822 is a typical magellanic dwarf irregular galaxy located at 500 kpc from the sun , and after the magellanic clouds , is our closest neighbor more luminous than m@xmath1 = 16 .",
    "the optical appearance of this galaxy is dominated by a bar , mapped by @xcite , about 8@xmath2 long and with a position angle ( pa)of 10@xmath3 while its hi content forms a huge disk at a pa @xmath4 130@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) and dwarf spheroidal / elliptical galaxies ( dsph / des ) differ primarily by their baryonic content , with the virtual absence of a stellar population younger than a crossing time and no significant hi disk in dsph / des ; the known exceptions , such as ngc 205 , bear marks of a tidally disturbed past .",
    "dirrs , on the other hand , are marked by a photometrically dominant population of young stars unevenly distributed over the inner portions of a pronounced hi disk that often extends ( at 10@xmath5 cm @xmath6 ) well beyond their holmberg radii . in terms of their surrounding environment the dsph",
    "/ des are found concentrated toward regions of high galaxy density in clusters where mean times to harassing encounters are significantly less than a hubble time .",
    "the dirrs are found preferentially in isolated environments where the mean time for a tidally harassing encounter is long , so that for their intrinsic observed velocities the likelihood of encountering a `` neighbor '' of comparable or greater mass in less than a hubble time is esteemed to be minute .",
    "a currently fashionable scenario envisions these two classes as sharing a common origin , with transitions of dirrs and small spirals into dsph / des types arising from ram pressure stripping @xcite or galaxy harassment @xcite by more massive neighbors . with the long relaxation time of dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the former mechanism does not significantly modify the disk angular momenta while the latter may do so when a sufficient number of harassments accumulates .",
    "it is worth contrasting this view with an alternate relying on numerical simulations initiated by alar and juri toomre @xcite .",
    "these demonstrate that tidally generated tails of interacting galaxies may leave debris mixtures of some variety .",
    "the internal dynamical signatures of this debris , such as spin , velocity dispersion and orbital angular momentum would almost certainly be distinct from those of dwarf systems of primordial origin .",
    "observations suggesting the current formation of such stellar debris during a tidally disruptive encounter are well known @xcite .",
    "observational properties of a dwarf galaxy are not unambiguously indicative of which formation mechanism is relevant . consequently it becomes risky to propose cosmological inferences from dynamical traits observed in dwarf galaxies whose dynamical histories are no longer uniquely determined .",
    "the most irritating aspect of this conundrum is the difficulty in accounting for the presence or absence of system spin .",
    "recent surveys , over large angular areas , of local group galaxies have revealed that these galaxies , being spiral or dirrs are much bigger than previously thought .",
    "s halo and disk have recently expanded @xcite , the disk of ngc 300 has been detected up to 10 scale lengths @xcite .",
    "our local group carbon survey reveals the existence of two distinct scenarios : 1 ) a stationary environment , i.e. , wlm , ngc 3109 , ngc 185 @xcite where all the c stars lie within a few scale lengths from the center ; 2 ) scenarios where we see dynamical violence in their past history . the primary examples of the latter are the magellanic clouds @xcite , ngc 6822 @xcite and ic10 @xcite with carbon stars found beyond seven scale lengths .",
    "the lmc is quite extended with fragments of the disk seen by @xcite 7@xmath3 to the north .",
    "for the last twelve years we have identified c stars in several local group galaxies ( see @xcite for a summary ) for eventual use as dynamical test particles in the outer parts of galaxies @xcite , to facilitate tracking of angular momentum .",
    "the photometric data set , discussed in this letter , corresponds to r@xmath2 and i@xmath2 images taken with megaprime / megacam in queue observing mode in may and june 2004 on the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "the wide field imager megacam consists of 36 2048 @xmath0 4612 pixel ccds , covering nearly a full 1@xmath7 field .",
    "it offers a resolution of 0.187 arcsecond per pixel .",
    "four slightly overlapping fields were observed , the galaxy located at the common corners , to cover essentially a 2@xmath8 area centered on ngc 6822 .",
    "the data distributed by the cfht have been pre - reduced , corrected for bias , flat fielded , etc .",
    "the photometric reductions were done by terapix , the data reduction center dedicated to the processing of extremely large data flow .",
    "the terapix team , located at the institut dastrophysique de paris , matches and stacks all images taken with the same filter and , using sextractor @xcite , provided magnitude calibrated catalogues of objects in each of the combined images .",
    "the spectroscopic data consist of two sets of observations .",
    "spectra of carbon stars ( identified by @xcite ) were obtained with two telescopes .",
    "fifty stars were observed with the wfccd spectrograph , in its chellette mode , at the du pont 2.5 telescope of las campanas observatory in august 2002 .",
    "the fwhm resolution is 1.7   over the spectral region 7850 to 8760  .",
    "sixty stars were observed with dolores multi - object spectrograph ( fwhm = 3.1  ) attached to the telescopio nazionale galileo located on cerro de los muchachos , la palma .",
    "the surface density of stars in the direction of ngc 6822 is high because of its relatively low galactic latitude ( b = 18.4@xmath3 ) . in order to increase the contrast between its low density periphery and the foreground field , we selected only stars with ( r@xmath2  i@xmath2)@xmath9 colors and magnitudes corresponding to the ngc 6822 red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "the reddening of the entire field has previously been mapped to deredden each star @xcite .",
    "this giant star selection yields some 150,000 stars , most of them members of ngc 6822 .",
    "the whole field is then covered by a 50 @xmath0 50 pixel wide grid and stars are counted over a circular 500 pixel sampling area , centered on each intersection of the grid .",
    "this is done to smooth out major irregularities ( mainly due to bright foreground stars that locally prevent the detection of fainter members of ngc6822 ) .",
    "this density map is transformed into a density image that is analyzed with iraf / stsdas / analysis / isophote / ellipse to fit isodensity ellipses , determine their position angles and ellipticities .",
    "this technique has previously been employed by us to map the structure of ic 10 @xcite .",
    "figure 1 presents the isodensity contours of the rgb stars .",
    "contours corresponding to 3,10,20,30 sigmas above the average count level are shown .",
    "the inner ellipse fits the 3@xmath10 contours while the larger one corresponds to 1.2@xmath10 and is the outermost one identified by the iraf ellipse task , it has a semi - major axis of 36@xmath2 .",
    "one can see that the major axis of the ellipse is nearly orthogonal to the hi disk , represented by the dashed line .",
    "this spheroid density profile is well fitted by a two - exponential law with scale lengths of 3.8@xmath2 and 10@xmath2 , which are interpreted as follow . beyond the freeman radius of roughly 5 scale lengths ( of 3.8@xmath2 )",
    "we perceive a change in slope , a flattening , that in very roughly corresponds to the radius where tidal deformations from interactions might be expected .",
    "n - particle simulations should eventually clarify this interpretation .",
    "the two ellipses in fig",
    ". 1 are characteristic of the whole family of ellipses of various major axes than can be traced .",
    "indeed , from 10@xmath2 to 35@xmath2 the pa of the major axis varies from 80@xmath3 to 65@xmath3 while the ellipticity range from 0.24 to 0.38 . more details can be found in our forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "this figure shows that the bulk of the spheroidal population stars in ngc 6822 , surrounding its bright central bar is comparable in size to the hi disk , mapped by @xcite , but oriented quite differently .",
    "radial velocities of 110 carbon stars observed within 15@xmath2 of the hi major axis from an earlier survey @xcite are described here .",
    "the spectra covered the spectral domain from 7500 to roughly 9000  , relying on roughly 50 night sky lines for wavelength calibration , and four template carbon stars from @xcite ; velocity variability affect these n - type carbons , limiting the system precision to @xmath1115 km s@xmath12 .",
    "their mean distribution , referred to ti 0357 + 0908 , lies between + 10 and 70 km s@xmath12 .",
    "figure 2 shows the radial velocities plotted as a function for the spheroid major axis .",
    "even so , carbon stars as kinematic `` test particles '' airport the advantage of freedom from contamination the galactic foreground might otherwise impose .",
    "telluric absorption features ( from primarily h@xmath13o and o@xmath13 ) were used to compensate for possibly uneven illumination of the slit masks that might otherwise introduce an arbitrary velocity shift .",
    "the spatial distribution of these carbon stars fits the spheroid better than the hi . quite apart from this spatial distribution",
    ", however , it was found that the coordinate system x , y that yielded the minimal residuals in rotation velocities is directed toward pa of between 63 and 67 degrees , and so places the rotation axis of the system of carbon stars at very nearly right angles to that of the hi disk and close to the minor axis of the spheroid .",
    "figure 3 shows the variation of the dispersion residuals with trial orientations of the x , y frame .",
    "our conclusion is that the carbon stars ( 1 ) show no preference for the hi disk and ( 2 ) demonstrate that they form part of a stellar population rotating at nearly right angles to the hi disk , leading to the suggestion that the hi disk is a structure more reminiscent of a polar ring .",
    "the close similarity between the morphology and kinematics of ngc 6822 and classical polar ring galaxies ( prg s ) suggests analogous formation scenarios , which we explore briefly ( with our thanks to the referee ) .",
    "foremost among these similarities are the nearly perpendicular orientations of two systems of angular momenta .",
    "also , investigators of prg s have commented that almost all such systems show indications of recent formation , possibly within the last two gyr @xcite .",
    "last , and from our perspective the most significant , is the severe dissimilarity between the population types of these two components : one being virtually gas - free , while the other shows little evidence for the existence of an older component ( represented by an rgb ) .",
    "more explicitly , the absence of carbon stars in the hi disk on the one hand , and simultaneously the absence of gas and a young stellar population in the spheroid on the other carries important connotations for time scales .",
    "the presence of carbon stars in a dominated by rgb stars spheroidal component of ngc 6822 bears similarities with other spheroids of the local group @xcite even though major differences must be noted .",
    "no other spheroid of the local group shows comparable spin ; for ngc 205 ( m@xmath1 = 16.3 ) the spin found by @xcite is one seventh that detected here , and a comparison with dwarf ellipticals of the virgo group by @xcite places the spheroid of ngc6822 far above the upper limit of their sample ( their fig .",
    "4 ) . comparing the luminosity function of the spheroid s rgb with that of fornax @xcite yields an m@xmath1 = 14.6 , or m@xmath14 = 15.8 then locates the spin of ngc6822 s spheroid within one standard deviation of the infrared tully - fisher relation as given by @xcite .",
    "this suggests interpretation that , instead of a spheroid , we are seeing a dwarf disk that has lost its original gaseous and young population component .",
    "an inspection of the distribution of the young population associated with the hi disk may help to put constraints to possible scenarios .",
    "these stars fill a narrow elongated ellipse close to the outer hi periphery @xcite .",
    "the outer envelope of this distribution is the same , and comparably populated , for stars of @xmath4 500 myr age ( as determined from isochrone fittings ) as is found for extremely young stars of @xmath4 50 myr , suggesting that the last traces of transient tidal phenomena had extinguished completely at some prior epoch , leading to the conclusion that whatever tidal event produced the polar ring phenomenon must be significantly older .    in their descriptions of the classical prg s @xcite",
    "comment on the population dissimilarity between the two components .",
    "we note also an observation from @xcite that strikes us as crucially relevant . to start a merger or accretion process that initiates a hiatus or break of duration longer than a crossing time of the spheroid or the polar ring without going to completion requires incredibly finely tuned dynamical starting conditions of low orbital energies .",
    "such low orbital energy differences between two neighboring galaxies in a cluster such as where s0 galaxies are observed is an exceedingly unlikely occurrence .",
    "more problematic , if what is seen are incomplete mergers , why are such detained mergers observed only when one member ( generally the more massive ) is an almost gas - free system , not far in the hubble sequence from the s0 types , and the other always gas rich ? if the orbital energetics of such finely tuned merging encounters are the determining factor for the formation of prg s , then all hubble types should be represented , and this is not seen .    from our work of carbon stars as dynamical test particles in interacting disruptive encounters between the magellanic clouds ,",
    "another formation scenario for prg s , not treated by @xcite in their exploration of likely formation processes , strikes us as capable of generating `` gentle '' merger conditions thought significant by the toomre s and simultaneously to account for the population dissimilarity between the two components . in this concept a disk galaxy striking the outer envelope of a more massive perturber experiences a purely gravitational though relatively mild impulse to its stellar component , but additionally another incremental impulse to its gaseous component .    in the case of the smc traversing the lmc disk",
    "decreased the orbital angular momentum of the gaseous component more so that the purely gravitational tidal impulse , so as to lag behind the stellar component by almost 2 kpc some 300 myr later @xcite ; other manifestations separating the gas component trajectories from those of the stellar are apparent in much of the region between the magellanic clouds .",
    "we recall the case of ugc7636 , a dwarf galaxy which , after interacting with the elliptical ngc 4472 left its entire gas component several system diameters behind in orbit @xcite a more aggravated interaction of similar sort . without asking with which of the two separated components of ugc7636 a dm halo might remain , we note that as an instance scaled somewhere in between the smc episode and that of ugc7636 , the prg s syndrome would appear best represented by an incomplete tidal disruption in which the prg hiatus is now more easily placed into context phenomenologically , accounting entirely for the dissimilarity between the population contents of the two components .",
    "we conclude noting that whichever scenarios for a prg formation one prefers , encounters with massive neighbors are always needed .",
    "this is quite a puzzling circumstance since ngc 6822 is considered to be a typical isolated dwarf galaxy .",
    "further investigations are needed to solve the riddle of the missing culprit .",
    "this research is funded in parts ( s. d. ) by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ."
