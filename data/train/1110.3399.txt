    "is the space - time geometry discrete , or is it continuous , but equipped by quantum properties ?",
    "the quantum properties associate with some portions , quanta and discreteness .",
    "however , it seems intuitively , that the space - time geometry is rather discrete , than it has mystic quantum properties , because the concept of discreteness does not contain anything mysterious . nevertheless if one consider the scales , which are much more , than the elementary length @xmath0 ( characteristic length of the discrete geometry ) , it is of no importance , whether the space - time geometry is discrete or continuous .",
    "contemporary space - time geometry is a differential geometry .",
    "all concepts of the differential geometry are based on the concept of continuity .",
    "such concepts ( manifold , dimension , coordinate system , differential equations of dynamics ) can be introduced and used only in a continuous space - time geometry . besides , a discrete geometry is nonaxiomatizable geometry .",
    "it means , that a discrete geometry can not be obtained as a logical construction , because the equivalence relation is intransitive , in general , in a discrete geometry . in its turn the intransitivity of",
    "the equivalence relation is a corollary of the following circumstance . for determination of a vector @xmath1 at the given point @xmath2 , which is equivalent to a given vector @xmath3 at the point @xmath4",
    ", one needs to solve two algebraic equations ( condition of vectors parallelism , condition of equality of their lengths ) .",
    "the number of coordinates ( four ) of the point @xmath5 is more than the number of equations . as a result",
    "there are many solutions , in general .",
    "there are many vectors @xmath1 , @xmath6 , ... at the given point @xmath2 , which are equivalent to the vector @xmath3 at the point @xmath4 , but vectors @xmath1 , @xmath6 , ... are not equivalent between themselves .",
    "such a situation means intransitivity of the equivalence relation for vectors .",
    "hence , a discrete geometry can not be a logical construction , because in any logical construction the equivalence relation is transitive .",
    "it can not be constructed by the euclidean method , which is used for construction of the proper euclidean geometry .    on the other hand , the euclidean method of a geometry construction",
    "is used longer , than two thousands years , and we do not know any other method .",
    "the only euclidean method of a geometry construction is learnt in all schools . as a result",
    "we perceive hardly the idea of alternative method of a geometry construction .",
    "we can not imagine , how one can construct a discrete space - time geometry , if it is nonaxiomatizable and one can not use the conventional euclidean method .",
    "it seems to be simpler to consider continuous space - time geometry , equipping it by mystic quantum properties , which imitate discreteness .",
    "this imitation appeared to be very successful .",
    "unfortunately , this imitation is not complete ( as well as the imitation of thermal phenomena by means of the thermogen ) , and we are forced to return to idea of discrete space - time geometry , if we want to describe physical phenomena in microcosm .    a geometry is a science on geometrical objects , on their shape and on their disposition in the space or in the space - time .",
    "the proper euclidean geometry is the first geometry , which has been constructed .",
    "geometrical objects of the euclidean geometry are usually constructed as combination of fundamental blocks ( point , segment of straight , angle ) .",
    "properties of these fundamental blocks and the rules of their combination at the construction of geometrical objects were formulated as axioms of some logical construction .",
    "the proper euclidean geometry was studied in the form of a logical construction in the last two thousand years . as a result practically all scientists believe , that any geometry is a logical construction , and that any geometry is to be constructed as a logical construction .",
    "it is supposed , that any geometry can be deduced from a system of properly chosen axioms , and there are no geometries which can not be deduced from a proper chosen axiomatics .",
    "this fact is formulated as follows .",
    "only axiomatizable geometries do exist and there are no nonaxiomatizable geometries . in other words ,",
    "a geometry is identified with a logical construction .",
    "the belief in the identity of a geometry and a logical construction was so large , that one uses the term `` geometry '' with respect to disciplines , which have a logical structure of the euclidean geometry , but have no relation to the science on geometrical objects and their shape ( for instance , symplectic geometry ) .",
    "a geometry , identified with a logical construction ( axiomatizable geometry ) will be referred to as a mathematical geometry .",
    "the proper euclidean is a mathematical geometry .",
    "a geometry as a science on geometrical objects , on their shape and on their disposition is described completely by a distance function @xmath7 between any two points @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a point set , where the geometry is given .",
    "it is more convenient to use world function @xmath10 instead of the distance function @xmath11 , because the world function @xmath12 is real in any geometry ( even in the space - time geometry of minkowski ) .",
    "the geometry , which is described completely by their world function will be referred to as a physical geometry , because physicists are not interested in the way of the geometry construction .",
    "they are not interested in the circumstance , whether or not the physical geometry is axiomatizable .    the proper euclidean geometry as well as the geometry of minkowski are continuous geometries .",
    "however , there may exist discrete geometries , where the distance between any two points of the space - time is larger , than some elementary length @xmath0 .",
    "if characteristic scale of the problem is much larger , than the elementary length @xmath0 , one may set @xmath13 and consider a continuous geometry .",
    "however , in microcosm , where characteristic scale is of the order of @xmath0 , one should consider a discrete space - time geometry .    at the conventional construction of the euclidean geometry one uses such concepts as manifold , dimension ,",
    "coordinate system , linear vector space , which might be used only in continuous geometries . constructing a discrete geometry as a generalization of the proper euclidean geometry",
    ", one may not use these concepts .",
    "the only concept , which may be used in both continuous geometry and in the discrete one , is the distance @xmath11 .",
    "but the distance @xmath11 is to be introduced as a fundamental quantity . in the riemannian geometry",
    "the distance @xmath11 is introduced as an integral along the geodesic from the infinitesimal distance @xmath14such a method of introduction of the distance @xmath11 is inadequate in the discrete geometry , because it uses infinitesimal distance , which does not exist in the discrete geometry .",
    "besides , in the case , when there are several geodesics , connecting two points , one obtains many - valued expressions for the distance or for the world function .",
    "many - valued world function is inadmissible in a geometry .    to construct a discrete geometry",
    ", one needs to represent the proper euclidean geometry in terms of the distance @xmath11 ( or in terms of the world function @xmath10 ) and to use this representation for generalization of the proper euclidean geometry @xmath15 on the case of a discrete geometry @xmath16 .",

    "these relations are to use for definition of such quantities as @xmath17 } $ ] , @xmath20 , @xmath23 and linear dependence , because these definitions do not refer to dimension , coordinate system , linear vector space and other means of description of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "these definitions contain only such a fundamental geometrical quantity as the world function .",
    "these definitions are written in the coordinateless invariant form .",
    "as a result these definitions may and must be used as definitions of any physical geometry , i.e. a geometry described completely in terms of the world function .",
    "any geometrical object can be described in terms of the world function .",
    "the geometrical object properties are calculated on the basis of its @xmath12-immanent representation ( representation in terms of the world function ) and of the world function form .",
    "generalization of these expressions on the case of the discrete geometry @xmath33 is obtained by means of the replacement @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the world function of the discrete geometry @xmath33 .",
    "we are to be ready , that properties of concepts ( [ c1.1 ] ) - ( [ c1.5 ] ) in @xmath33 differ strongly from their properties in @xmath15 .",

    "if one demands coincidence of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the case equivalence of @xmath45 and  @xmath46 , then an elimination of one point @xmath18 from the point set @xmath43 turns the geometry @xmath47 into geometry @xmath48 , which appears to be not equivalent to the geometry @xmath45 . such a situation seems to be inadmissible , because a geometry on a part @xmath49 of the point set @xmath43 appears to be not equivalent to the geometry on the whole point set @xmath43 .",

    "thus , the relation of equivalence is intransitive , in general .",
    "the space - time geometry may vary in different regions of the space - time .",
    "it means , that a physical body , described as a geometrical object , may evolve in such a way , that it appears in regions with different space - time geometry .",
    "the space - time geometry of minkowski as well as the euclidean geometry are continuous geometries .",
    "it is true for usual scales of distances .",
    "however , one can not be sure , that the space - time geometry is continuous in microcosm .",
    "the space - time geometry may appear to be discrete in microcosm .",
    "we consider a discrete space - time geometry and discuss the corollaries of the suggested discreteness .",
    "the distance function @xmath60 of a discrete geometry @xmath33 satisfies the condition@xmath61which means that in the geometry @xmath33 there are no distances , which are shorter , than the elementary length @xmath0 .",
    "the distance @xmath62 is admissible .",
    "this condition takes place , if @xmath63 .",
    "note , that the condition ( [ a1.1 ] ) is a restriction on the values of the distance function , but not on values of its argument ( points of @xmath9 ) , although one considers usually a discrete geometry as a geometry on a lattice .",
    "it is true , that the geometries on a lattice are discrete geometries , but they form a very special case of the discrete geometries .",
    "besides , such a discrete geometry can not be uniform and isotropic . a general case of a discrete geometry takes place , when restrictions are imposed on the admissible values of the world function ( distance function )",
    ".    the simplest case of a discrete space - time geometry @xmath16 is obtained , if @xmath64 is given on the manifold @xmath65 , where the geometry of minkowski @xmath66 is given .",
    "the world function @xmath35 is chosen in the form@xmath67where @xmath68 is the world function of the geometry of minkowski .",
    "it is easy to verify , that @xmath69 , defined by ( [ a1.2 ] ) satisfies the constraint ( [ a1.1 ] ) .",
    "such a discrete geometry is uniform and isotropic as well as the geometry of minkowski    besides , in the discrete space - time geometry ( [ a1.2 ] ) a pointlike particle can not be described by a world line , because any world line is a limit of the broken line , when lengths of its links tend to zero .",
    "but in the discrete geometry @xmath33 there are no infinitesimal lengths , and a pointlike particle is described by a world chain ( broken line ) instead of continuous world line . description of a pointlike particle state by means of the particle position and its momentum becomes inadequate , because in the continuous space - time geometry the particle 4-momentum @xmath70 is described by the relation@xmath71where @xmath72 , @xmath73 is an equation of the world line .",
    "the limit in the formula ( [ a1.3 ] ) does not exist in @xmath33 , and the 4-momentum @xmath70 is not defined ( at any rate in such a form ) . in general , the mathematical formalism , based on the infinitesimal calculus ( differential dynamic equations ) , is inadequate in the discrete space - time geometry .",
    "the world chain @xmath74 of a particle has the form @xmath75where vector @xmath76 is an ordered set of two points @xmath77 .",

    "the world chain @xmath74 describes the free motion of the pointlike particle , if in addition to the relation ( [ a1.5 ] ) the adjacent links of the chain are parallel@xmath84where @xmath85 is the @xmath12-immanent expression for the scalar product of two vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "relations ( [ a1.5 ] ) and ( [ a1.7 ] ) means that adjacent vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 are equivalent . according to ( [ a1.5 ] ) the equation ( [ a1.7 ] ) may written in the form@xmath88the scalar product of vectors in the discrete geometry @xmath33 has the same form ( [ c1.2 ] ) , but the euclidean world function @xmath24 is replaced by the world function @xmath89 of the discrete geometry ( [ a1.2 ] ) . in the limit @xmath90 the world function @xmath91 and the scalar product in @xmath33 turns to the scalar product in the geometry of minkowski .    fixing points @xmath92 and @xmath93 and solving equations ( [ a1.5 ] ) , ( a1.7a ) to determine the point @xmath94 , one obtains many solutions for the point @xmath94 .",
    "this circumstance is explained by the fact , that one has only two equations for determination of four coordinates of the point @xmath94 .",
    "it means that the links of the world chain ( [ a1.4 ] ) wobble , and the shape of the world chain appears to be random ( stochastic ) .    statistical description of random world chains leads to the schrdinger equation @xcite , provided the elementary length @xmath0 has the form @xmath95where @xmath96 is the quantum constant , @xmath97 is the speed of the light , and @xmath98 is the universal constant , defined by the relation ( [ a1.6 ] ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation describes a motion of free stochastic ( quantum ) particle , and this description contains the particle mass @xmath81 , although the classical description of a free particle motion does not contain a reference to the particle mass .",
    "explanation of quantum effects ( the schrdinger equation ) as geometrical effects of the discrete space - time geometry is very important , because it shows , that introduction of quantum principles is overabundant .",
    "this result suggests to resolve between two paradigms : either discrete space - time geometry , or continuous space - time geometry equipped by quantum principles .",
    "it is evident , that discrete space - time geometry is the simplest and more natural solution , than an invention of quantum principles , whose meaning is unclear .",
    "note , that replacing in quantum mechanics the classical momentum by an operator or be a matrix , one imitates a multivariance ( indeterminacy ) of the particle momentum , described by the relation ( [ a1.3 ] ) in @xmath33 .",
    "besides , the discrete space - time geometry admits one to describe both the indeterministic motion of a single particle and the deterministic motion of an statistically averaged particle , whereas the quantum paradigm admits one to describe only the statistically averaged particle motion . in application to the theory of elementary particles the statistically averaged particle motion does not give a possibility to penetrate in the elementary particle structure , whereas the single particle motion ( even indeterministic ) gives a hope to understand the elementary particles structure .",
    "formally it means that the conception of particle dynamics in the discrete space - time geometry distinguishes from the particle dynamics conception in the space - time geometry of minkowski , because in the space - time geometry of minkowski the formalism of the particle dynamics uses essentially the continuity of the space - time geometry .",
    "this formalism can not be used in the discrete space - time geometry .",
    "in a physical geometry there is the only basic quantity ( world function ) , which describes completely all geometric objects of the geometry .",
    "all geometrical objects are described uniformly in all physical geometries .",
    "such geometrical objects as straight segment and angle are fundamental objects in conventional presentation of the proper euclidean geometry .",
    "their properties are formulated as axioms and they are used at the construction of more complicate geometric objects . in the physical geometry the straight segment and the angle are derivative objects , which are constructed in terms of the world function .    in the @xmath12-immanent presentation of the proper euclidean geometry",
    "the straight segment @xmath17 } $ ] between two points @xmath18 and @xmath19 is described by the relation ( [ c1.1 ] ) .",
    "the angle @xmath99 between two vectors @xmath1 and @xmath3 is described by the formula@xmath100where the scalar product @xmath20 is defined by the formula ( [ c1.2 ] ) .",
    "if we try to construct the discrete geometry @xmath33 , defined by the relation ( [ a1.1 ] ) , starting from the axioms , which describe properties of the segment and of the angle , we could not determine , what are properties of the segment @xmath17 } $ ] in arbitrary geometry ( for instance , in a discrete geometry ) . starting from the axioms of the proper euclidean geometry , it is very difficult to imagine , that the straight segment can be a tube ( surface ) , but not a one - dimensional line .",
    "starting from these axioms , one can not obtain the formula ( [ c1.1 ] ) for the straight segment in the discrete space - time geometry . as a result the version of the discrete space - time geometry was not developed .",
    "one developed the continuous space - time geometry , equipped by quantum principles instead of the discrete space - time geometry .",
    "this approach was founded on the supposition , that all geometrical objects can be constructed as combination of fundamental blocks ( point , segment , angle ) .",
    "this supposition means , that a geometry is a logical construction ( axiomatizable geometry )",
    ". the axiomatizability condition may be too restrictive for real space - time geometry . at any rate",
    ", it was not reasonable to impose this constraint from the beginning .",
    "almost all basic concepts of differential geometry ( manifold , dimension , coordinate system , linear dependence of vectors ) are used at the supposition , that the geometry is continuous . only concept of distance function",
    "is an exception , which may be defined in a discrete geometry . using the distance function as an only basic quantity of a geometry , one may hope to describe both continuous and discrete geometries .",
    "the idea to describe a geometry in terms of a distance function is an old idea .",
    "the following conditions were imposed on the distance function @xmath101@xmath102@xmath103@xmath104such a geometry is known as the metric geometry .",
    "the condition ( [ a2.5 ] ) admits only such geometries , where the straight segment ( [ c1.1 ] ) is a one - dimensional point set .",
    "the condition ( [ a2.3 ] ) forbids an application of the metric geometry to the space - time .",
    "there were attempts to introduce so called distant geometry @xcite , which is free of restriction ( [ a2.5 ] ) .",
    "note , that the triangle axiom ( [ a2.5 ] ) means , that the straight is an one - dimensional set of points .",
    "however , blumental @xcite could not overcome the concept of the euclidean geometry , that the straight line has no thickness , although a formal obstruction in the form of the triangle axiom ( [ a2.5 ] ) has been overcome .",
    "from the logical viewpoint the fact , that in the euclidean geometry a straight is an one - dimensional point set , does not mean , that the straight is a one - dimensional point set in any geometry .",
    "nevertheless , blumental introduced a curve as a continuous mapping of interval @xmath105 onto the space @xmath9 .",
    "he has introduced an additional fundamental concept ( continuous mapping ) , which can not be formulated in terms of a distance . as a result",
    "the distant geometry lost its monistic character , when the geometry is described completely in terms of a distance .",
    "the physical geometry distinguishes from the conventional presentation of the euclidean geometry in the relation , that it is a monistic conception , which is described completely in terms of the world function ( or distance ) .",
    "there is no necessity to reconcile different fundamental concepts of the geometry , because there is only one fundamental quantity .",

    "formalism of the discrete geometry is very simple . it does not contain theorems with complicated proofs",

    "the discrete geometry was not developed in the twentieth century , although the discrete space - time was necessary for description of physical phenomena in microcosm .",

    "we try to answer this important question .",
    "the discrete geometry was not developed , because it could be obtained only as a generalization of the proper euclidean geometry .",

    "supposition , that any geometry is to be axiomatizable , was the second obstacle on the way of the discrete geometry construction .",
    "in general , the fact , that the proper euclidean geometry is a degenerate geometry , was another obstacle . in particular , being a physical geometry , the proper euclidean geometry is an axiomatizable geometry , and this circumstance is an evidence of its degeneracy .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain a general conception as a generalization of a degenerate conception , because many quantities of the general conception coincide in the degenerate conception .",

    "i did not know the papers of synge and introduced the world function for description of the riemannian space - time in general relativity .",

    "this equation put the question .",
    "let a world function does not satisfy the equation .",
    "does this world function describe a nonriemannian geometry or it does describe no geometry ?",
    "it was very difficult to answer this question .",
    "on one hand , the formalism , based on the world function , is a more developed formalism , than formalism based on a use of metric tensor , because a geodesic is described in terms of the world function by algebraic equation ( [ c1.1 ] ) , whereas the same geodesic is described by differential equations in terms the metric tensor .",
