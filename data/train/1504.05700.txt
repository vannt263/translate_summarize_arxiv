    "solar flares are a phenomenon in which a huge amount of magnetic energy stored in the coronal field is rapidly released by magnetic reconnection . where magnetic reconnection is a physical process in which a magnetic field in a highly conducting plasma changes its connectivity due to finite resistivity .",
    "the rapid energy release is accompanied by various plasma dynamics , like shock waves and the chromospheric evaporation . for more details about solar flares ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "flares similar to solar flares have been observed from many stars and other astrophysical objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since many of those flares and solar flares have many common features , solar flare models have been applied to those astrophysical flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that there should be differences in the plasma parameters between those flares and solar flares , like the plasma density , alfven speed , and system size .",
    "since these values determine the time scales of different processes , this can make the evolution of different flares distinct .",
    "therefore , to comprehensively understand the flare physics in the universe , we need to explore various flares in a wide range of the plasma parameters .",
    "there are many attempts to model solar and stellar flare loops .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) hydrodynamic models have been widely developed to study the thermal evolution and flows in a single loop .",
    "depending on the assumed main energy transfer process , the models can be categorized into two branches : conduction - heating models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and electron - beam - heating models ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general , the results of both models agree with observed emissions well .",
    "@xcite developed a pseudo-2d loop model based on 1d hydrodynamic calculations , and gave a simple description of observed soft x - ray emissions ( see @xcite for further development of this kind of models ) .",
    "the first 2d magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of a solar flare based on a reconnection model with the heat conduction was performed by @xcite , and they studied the thermal evolution in the post - flare loops and the physics that determines the flare temperature .",
    "@xcite performed mhd simulations of reconnection with the heat conduction to study the coronal mass ejections and associated giant arcade , where they do not include the chromosphere .",
    "@xcite carried out a mhd simulation of chromospheric evaporation jets formed as a result of reconnection between emerging magnetic flux and a coronal ambient field .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite developed a theoretical model in which the dynamics of a reconnected field line is considered .",
    "shocks in and above the post - flare loops can be important for both the non - thermal particle acceleration and evolution of the thermal structure . the above - the - looptop hard x - ray source found by @xcite has posed problems about the electron acceleration mechanism ( for recent progress , see ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and @xcite ) .",
    "one of the promising scenarios is the acceleration by fast shocks which are expected to be formed above the soft x - ray post - flare loops @xcite .",
    "recently acceleration from contracting plasmoids @xcite and acceleration in plasmoids interacting with fast shocks @xcite have been also proposed .",
    "it has been argued that a high - density region can be formed as a result of the shock - shock interaction at the top @xcite and by the compression at termination shocks @xcite .",
    "@xcite carefully analyze shocks in a plasmoid in a ideal 2d mhd simulation . despite the importance",
    ", the shock formation in and above the post - flare loops has not been yet investigated in detail .",
    "how post - flare loops evolve in many astrophysical systems is one of our central interests .",
    "since reconnection produces hot and high - speed plasma flows , it is expected that the thermal structure should be determined by a coupling among the plasma flows , shocks , and heat conduction .",
    "the heat conduction is essential to drive the hot high - speed evaporation flows .",
    "however , the calculation of the plasma dynamics with the heat conduction effects is computationally expensive .",
    "this makes the extensive parameter survey in the multi - dimensional mhd simulations difficult .",
    "the development of a simplified post - flare loop model based on a reconnection model is therefore desired .",

    "to understand the shock formation in 2d systems , a 2d mhd simulation of a solar flare has been carried out .",
    "we found new shock structures in and above the post - flare loops , which were not well resolved in the previous work by @xcite . to study the dynamics of flows along the reconnected magnetic field in detail ,",
    "kinematics and energetics of the plasma are investigated along selected field lines .",
    "it is found that shocks in the post - flare loops are crucial to determine the thermal and flow structures in the post - flare loops . on the basis of the results of the 2d mhd simulation",
    ", we have developed a new post - flare loop model which we call the pseudo-2d mhd model .",
    "the model is based on the 1d mhd equations , and has been developed to model a 3d reconnected field line . through a comparison , it is found that the shock formation and thermal evolution in the pseudo-2d mhd model are similar to those in the 2d mhd model .",

    "note that the variation of the total energy remains within @xmath62  % .",
    "the field line rooted at @xmath63 also gives a similar result .",
    "the small variation in the total energy reflects the fact that the compressive and expanding motions by the surrounding plasma are localized in time and space ( see figure  [ fig : ro_te_vp_divv_2dmhd ] ) .",
    "therefore , the compressive motion of the reconnected flux tube is found to be not significant with respect to the total energy variation .",
    "through the analysis of the 2d mhd simulation , we found that the field - aligned plasma motions ( particularly evaporation flows and slow shocks ) and heat conduction seem to mainly determine the dynamics in the post - flare loops .",
    "fast shocks are important for converting the kinetic energy of the reconnection outflow to the heat and for locally changing the cross - sectional area , but they do not largely change the total energy of the field lines ( figure  [ fig : energy_line_2dmhd ] ) . on the basis of the results , we aim to model the multi - dimensional reconnection and flare processes in a simplified mhd scheme .    what is important for conduction - heating - type flare modeling would be 1 . to model a reconnected field line , 2 . to model the reconnection inflow and outflow , 3 . to include mhd waves ( since mhd waves can carry a large amount of the released energy from the reconnection sites @xcite ) , 4 .",

    "we developed a model based on the 1d mhd equations , where all the variables depend on one space dimension and all the three components of the magnetic and velocity fields are considered .",
    "we regard our model as a pseudo-2d mhd model .",

    "when we integrate the energies , we drop off the term @xmath102 in the integrand because in the pseudo-2d mhd model the variation of the cross - sectional area is not considered .",
    "figure  [ fig : energy_line_p2dmhd ] is the same as figure  [ fig : energy_line_2dmhd ] but for the pseudo-2d mhd model .",
    "it is shown that @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , which is similar to the results of the 2d mhd model .",
    "previously a formula that determines the post - flare loop temperature was derived under the assumption that the energy input to a loop balances with the conduction cooling rate @xcite .",
    "the formula is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the volumetric heating rate and @xmath108 is the half length of the magnetic field line of a post - flare loop .",
    "the heating rate by magnetic reconnection is determined by the poynting flux : @xmath109 . using this ,",
    "the temperature can be written as @xmath110 by assuming that @xmath111 .",
    "this scaling law was derived by @xcite .",
    "we checked whether the scaling law based on a magnetic reconnection model holds in our pseudo-2d mhd model .",
    "figure  [ fig : scaling ] shows the numerically - obtained @xmath36-@xmath112 , @xmath65-@xmath112 and @xmath5-@xmath112 relations .",
    "@xmath113 denotes the temperature in the reconnection outflow .",
    "@xmath114 denotes the maximum temperature after the pair of the two slow shocks generated by the chromospheric evaporation flows collides at the apex . as shown in figure  [ fig : scaling ] , it is found that the temperature in the loop obeys the scaling law well .",
    "in this paper we investigated the flow structure , shock formation and thermal evolution in the post - flare loops using mhd simulations . on the basis of the 2d simulation result",
    ", we have developed a new post - flare loop model ( the pseudo-2d mhd model ) .",
    "we compare the flow structure , shock formation and energetics of a specific field line in the 2d calculation with those in the pseudo-2d mhd model , and then we find that they give similar results . here",
    "we summarize the results and compare our results with previous studies .    performing a 2d mhd simulation",
    ", we found new shock structures .",
    "the termination shock consists of two oblique fast - mode shocks and sometimes a horizontal fast - mode shock ( figure  [ fig : pr_top ] ) .",
    "a hump is formed as a result of the collision of the downflow and the chromospheric evaporation flow .",
    "after the collision , the fronts of the evaporation flow and downflow become slow shocks , and then the hump appears as a dense region behind the two slow shocks ( figure  [ fig : ro_hump_2dmhd ] ) .",
    "the upward slow shock finally interact with the slow shock coming from the other side at the top , forming the high - density region .",
    "note that the high - density region is separated from the blob in @xcite and is formed below it ( figure  [ fig : ro_looptop_2dmhd ] ) .",
    "we found that the strength of the termination shock in the 2d mhd model shows a quasi - periodic oscillation , which is a multi - dimensional feature .",
    "in addition , the shock reflection and mach reflection are sometimes observed in a concave magnetic structure , which could be important for understanding the heating in the loop - top .",
    "these complicated structures at the top will be detailed in our future papers .",
    "we observe no prominent shocks nor waves propagating back and forth from end to end .",
    "in addition , no prominent standing slow - mode waves are observed within the calculated time range . by performing 2d mhd simulations without the heat conduction",
    ", we confirmed that without the heat conduction the slow shocks formed at the fronts of the downflows from the top propagate back and forth from end to end .",
    "thus the propagation of the slow shocks in the post - flare loops is found to be significantly affected by the heat conduction and evaporation flows .",
    "the slow shocks are damped by the heat conduction .",
    "the propagation speed of the slow shocks is reduced by the evaporation flow ( doppler effect ) , which makes the shock propagation time longer .",
    "therefore it is essential to consider the flows resulting from reconnection ( particularly downflows from the top ) for understanding the behavior of magneto - acoustic waves in the post - flare loops .    in fully 3d situations , reconnection can be intermittent in space and time , which could affect the shock structures found in this study .",
    "3d component reconnection , where reconnecting magnetic field lines are not perfectly anti - parallel , can result in the reconnection outflow jet with a speed insufficient for the formation of the fast shock above the loop top .",
    "however , in the case that the reconnection outflow speed exceeds the fast mode phase speed in the outflow region , we expect the formation of the termination shock found as in our 2d mhd model .",
    "we also expect that the slow shocks presented in the 2d mhd model will be formed in 3d , since the field - aligned plasma flows which are essential to form slow shocks are well treated in our mhd flare modeling scheme .    from the 2d simulation",
    ", we found that the field - aligned plasma motions ( particularly evaporation flows and slow shocks ) and heat conduction mainly determine the dynamics in the post - flare loops . considering this , we construct the pseudo-2d mhd model which is basically a 1d mhd model .",
    "the pseudo-2d mhd model is compared with the 2d mhd model , and we found that the dynamics ( particularly flow structure and shock formation ) and the energetics are similar between the two models .",
    "the scaling law for the temperature based on a reconnection model is also examined , and it is found that the scaling law holds in the pseudo-2d mhd model .",
    "these facts indicate that our pseudo-2d mhd model captures important features of a reconnection model of solar flares .",
    "1d hydrodynamic models , like @xcite and @xcite , have been used for the post - flare loop modeling .",
    "the models are useful to study the thermal evolution and flows in the flare loops , but the energy input ( in many cases the heat input ) must be done by hand .",
    "our model includes many features of the multi - dimensional mhd processes related to magnetic reconnection , like the heating by the petschek slow shocks and conversion of the kinetic energy of the reconnection outflow to the heat .",
    "another important point is that our model can treat mhd waves and shocks generated in the post - flare loops , which could be important to understand the flow structure in the loops .",
    "we note that all the previous 1d hydrodynamic models lack the strong downflows from the top ( for example , see figure  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "we showed that the downflows play important roles in forming the humps and slow shocks ( figures  [ fig : ro_hump_2dmhd ] and [ fig : ro_looptop_2dmhd ] ) .",
    "our pseudo-2d mhd model naturally produces the downflows from the top , allowing us to study the dynamic evolution of the thermal structure .    a theoretical model in which field lines shorten after localized 3d reconnection based on the thin flux tube approximation was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the plasma has always low-@xmath36 .",
    "our 2d mhd simulation demonstrates that , because of the shock heating and compression , the plasma @xmath36 becomes larger than unity not only in the reconnection outflow but also in a large part of the post - flare loops ( see figure  [ fig : ro_te_ent_beta_2dmhd ] ) . in such regions ,",
    "we need to consider the effects of the gas pressure to understand the flow and shock structures .",
    "our pseudo-2d mhd model can treat the high-@xmath36 plasma .",
    "@xcite model could be valid in the situation in which the shock heating does not break the low-@xmath36 assumption ( e.g. in the situation in which the guide - field is much stronger than the reconnection field ) . regarding this issue ,",
    "see also appendix  [ ap : b ] .",
    "the high-@xmath36 condition could lead to disordering of the magnetic field when turbulence is important so that the geometrical assumptions made for our pseudo-2d mhd model are not met .",
    "we found no evidence that turbulence is important in the current sheet in our 2d mhd model .",
    "our model will be useful to model the reconnected field lines in such a situation in which turbulence is not important .    as a result of the approximations made for the pseudo-2d mhd model , some multi - dimensional processes such as termination shock formation and turbulence can not be modeled . however , the pseudo-2d mhd model are able to treat plasma flows and waves / shocks ( slow - mode waves / shocks and alfven waves ) along the magnetic field , which could be useful to understand the plasma motions in the post - flare loops .",
    "our pseudo-2d mhd model requires much smaller computational cost than other multi - dimensional mhd models .",
    "this model will allow us to study the evolution of the flare loops in a wide parameter space without expensive computational cost .",
    "also , it will be much easier to include detailed physics like the non - equilibrium ionization effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we modify the time step splitting method to calculate the heat conduction flux by @xcite . using the mhd energy flux @xmath115 and heat conduction energy flux @xmath116 , we can write the energy equation as follows : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the total energy .",

    "let us consider the situation without the guide field component ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "since the magnetic field vectors in the initial states are in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane , the rotational discontinuities will not appear in the solutions .",
    "due to the initial discontinuity , one contact discontinuity , two slow shocks , and two fast rarefaction waves are generated .    from the jump condition across the contact discontinuity",
    ", the tangential magnetic field , @xmath30 , should be equal to zero in the region between two slow shocks .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to have either the switch - off slow shock ( ss ) or the switch - off fast rarefaction wave ( frw ) . in the former case ( see the left panels of figure  [ fig : wave_structure ] ) , the exact solution consists of the switch - off ss and frw . on the other hand , in the latter case ( the middle panels of figure [ fig : wave_structure ] ) , the exact solution consists of the pure hydro shock ( hs ) and switch - off frw .",
    "there are two parameters in the symmetric mhd riemann problems : plasma beta @xmath36 and the reconnection angle @xmath68 .",
    "a sophisticated procedure to derive the exact solutions of more general mhd riemann problems was developed by @xcite .",
    "we utilize the procedure to derive the exact solutions of our problems .",
    "the result is summarized in the phase diagram of figure  [ fig : divide_region ] , where @xmath36 and @xmath68 are the key parameters . here",
    "the heat conduction is neglected .",
    "the @xmath68-@xmath36 space is divided into two regions : switch - off slow shock regime and pure hydro shock regime .",
    "the parameter set of the example introduced in this paper is within the switch - off slow shock region .",
    "if we include the heat conduction effect , the pure hydro shock region will become slightly wider .",
    "figure  [ fig : reconrate_1d ] displays the normalized reconnection rate in the @xmath68-@xmath36 diagram , where the normalized reconnection rate is defined by @xmath132 . where @xmath133 is the outflow speed , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "the maximum reconnection rate observed in solar flares and simulations is of the order of 0.1 . to take the reconnection rate similar to 0.1 in our model , we need to choose a reasonable parameter set from this diagram .",
    "if a guide field exists , the rotational discontinuities ( rd ) will appear in addition to ss and frw . in this case",
    "it is necessary to have either the switch - off ss , switch - off frw , or rd because of the boundary condition at the contact discontinuity ( @xmath136 ) . among them",
    ", only the solution with rd ( the right panels of figure  [ fig : wave_structure ] ) meets the requirement that the continuity condition of @xmath137 at the contact discontinuity should be satisfied @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that pure hydro shocks can be formed in a reconnected flux tube even when a guide field exists .",
    "however , considering the analysis here , pure hydro shocks will not appear when a guide field exists .",
