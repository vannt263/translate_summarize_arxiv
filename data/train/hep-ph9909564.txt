    "the weak phase @xmath3 enters through the interference of these two ( `` tree '' and `` penguin '' ) contributions . because of a fortunate interplay of isospin , fierz and flavor symmetries , the theoretical description of the charged modes @xmath0 is very clean despite the fact that these are exclusive nonleptonic decays @xcite . without any dynamical assumption ,",

    "only cp - averaged branching ratios are needed for this purpose .",
    "varying the strong phases @xmath33 and @xmath40 independently we first obtain an upper bound on the inverse of @xmath64 . keeping terms of linear order in @xmath41 , we find @xcite @xmath71 provided @xmath64 is significantly smaller than 1 , this bound implies an exclusion region for @xmath68 , which becomes larger the smaller the values of @xmath64 and @xmath52 are .",
    "it is convenient to consider instead of @xmath64 the related quantity @xcite @xmath72 because of the theoretical factor @xmath73 entering the definition of @xmath52 in ( [ eps ] ) this is , strictly speaking , not an observable .",
    "however , the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath74 is so much smaller than the present experimental error that it is justified to treat this quantity as an observable .",
    "the advantage of presenting our results in terms of @xmath74 rather than @xmath64 is that the leading dependence on @xmath52 cancels out , leading to the simple bound @xmath75 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rbound ] we show the upper bound on @xmath74 as a function of @xmath76 , obtained by varying the input parameters in the intervals @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( corresponding to using @xmath79 in ( [ delta ] ) ) .",
    "note that the effect of the rescattering contribution parameterized by @xmath41 is very small .",
    "the gray band shows the current value of @xmath74 , which clearly has too large an error to provide any useful information on @xmath3 .",
    "deviation from 1 indicated by the first preliminary cleo result has not been confirmed by the present data .",
    "] the situation may change , however , once a more precise measurement of @xmath74 will become available .",
    "for instance , if the current central value @xmath80 were confirmed , it would imply the bound @xmath81 , which would mark a significant improvement over the limit @xmath82 obtained from the global analysis of the unitarity triangle including information from @xmath83@xmath84 mixing @xcite .",
    "so far , as in previous work , we have used the inequality ( [ rbound ] ) to derive a lower bound on @xmath76 . however , a large part of the uncertainty in the value of @xmath43 , and thus in the resulting bound on @xmath76 , comes from the present large error on @xmath85 . since this is not a hadronic uncertainty , it is more appropriate to separate it and turn ( [ rbound ] ) into a constraint on the wolfenstein parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 . to this end",

    "ultimately , the goal is of course not only to derive a bound on @xmath3 but to determine this parameter directly from the data . this requires to fix the strong phase @xmath33 in ( [ expr ] ) , which can be done either through the measurement of a cp asymmetry or with the help of theory .",
    "a strategy for an experimental determination of @xmath3 from @xmath0 decays has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "it generalizes a method proposed by gronau , rosner and london @xcite to include the effects of electroweak penguins .",
    "the approach has later been refined to account for rescattering contributions to the @xmath28 decay amplitudes @xcite . before discussing this method",
    ", we will first illustrate an easier strategy for a theory - guided determination of @xmath3 based on the qcd factorization theorem derived in @xcite .",
    "this method does not require any measurement of a cp asymmetry .      in the previous section the theoretical predictions for the nonleptonic @xmath15 decay",

    "this determination is unique up to a sign .",
    "note that for small values of @xmath33 the impact of the strong phase in the expression for @xmath64 in ( [ expr ] ) is a second - order effect , since @xmath102 . as long as @xmath103 , the uncertainty in the value of @xmath104 has a much smaller effect than the uncertainty in @xmath52 . with the present value of @xmath52 ,",
    "this is the case as long as @xmath105 .",
    "we believe it is a safe assumption to take @xmath106 ( i.e. , more than twice the value obtained to leading order in @xmath2 ) , so that @xmath107 .    solving the equation for @xmath64 in ( [ expr ] ) for @xmath68 , and including the corrections of @xmath108",

    "figure  [ fig : ckmfit ] shows the allowed regions in the @xmath67 plane for the representative values @xmath88 , 0.75 , and 1.25 ( from right to left ) .",
    "we stress that with this method a useful constraint on the wolfenstein parameters is obtained for _ any _ value of @xmath74 .",
    "it is important that , once more precise data on @xmath0 decays will become available , it will be possible to test the theoretical prediction of a small strong phase @xmath33 experimentally .",
    "to this end , one must determine the cp asymmetry @xmath65 in addition to the ratio @xmath64 . from ( [ expr ] )",
    "it follows that for fixed values of @xmath52 and @xmath43 the quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 define contours in the @xmath116 plane , whose intersections determine the two phases up to possible discrete ambiguities @xcite . figure  [ fig : contours ] shows these contours for some representative values , assuming @xmath89 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . in practice , including the uncertainties in the values of these parameters changes the contour lines into contour bands .",

    "however , for typical values of @xmath64 it turns out that often only four solutions exist , two of which are related to the other two by a change of signs . the theoretical prediction",
    "that @xmath33 is small implies that solutions should exist where the contours intersect close to the lower portion in the plot .",
    "other solutions with large @xmath33 are strongly disfavored theoretically .",
    "moreover , according to ( [ expr ] ) the sign of the cp asymmetry @xmath65 fixes the relative sign between the two phases @xmath3 and @xmath33 .",
    "if we trust the theoretical prediction that @xmath33 is negative @xcite , it follows that in most cases there remains only a unique solution for @xmath3 , i.e. , _ the cp - violating phase @xmath3 can be determined without any discrete ambiguity_.    = 6.1 cm    as an example , consider the hypothetical case where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "in the presence of new physics the theoretical description of @xmath0 decays becomes more complicated . in particular , new cp - violating contributions to the decay amplitudes",
    "may be induced .",

    ", it is particularly sensitive to isospin - violating new physics contributions .",
    "the isospin - conserving effects parameterized by @xmath129 enter only through interference with the isospin - violating terms proportional to @xmath42 in ( [ ampls ] ) and hence are suppressed .",
    "new physics can affect the bound on @xmath3 derived from ( [ rbound ] ) as well as the value of @xmath3 extracted using the strategies discussed in the previous section .",
    "we will discuss these two possibilities in turn .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath138 in ( [ rbound ] ) and the corresponding bound on @xmath74 shown in figure  [ fig : rbound ] are model - independent results valid in the standard model .",
    "note that the extremal value of @xmath138 is such that @xmath139 irrespective of @xmath3 .",
    "a value of @xmath140 exceeding this bound would be a clear signal for new physics @xcite .",
    "consider first the case where new physics may induce arbitrary cp - violating contributions to the @xmath15 decay amplitudes , while preserving isospin symmetry .",
    "then the only change with respect to the standard model is that the parameter @xmath129 may no longer be as small as @xmath108 . varying the strong phases @xmath33 and @xmath132 independently , and allowing for an _ arbitrarily large _",
    "new physics contribution to @xmath129 , one can derive the bound @xcite @xmath141 note that the extremal value is the same as in the standard model , i.e. , isospin - conserving new physics effects can not lead to a value of @xmath140 exceeding @xmath142 . for intermediate values of @xmath3 between @xmath143 and @xmath144",
    "the standard model bound on @xmath74 is weakened .",

    "the important point to note is that with isospin - violating new physics contributions the value of @xmath140 can exceed the upper bound in the standard model by a potentially large amount .",
    "for instance , if @xmath148 is twice as large as in the standard model , corresponding to a new physics contribution to the decay amplitudes of only 1015% , then @xmath140 could be as large as 2.6 as compared with the maximal value 1.8 allowed in the standard model .",
    "also , in the most general case where @xmath131 and @xmath129 are nonzero , the maximal value @xmath140 can take is no longer restricted to occur at the endpoints @xmath149 or @xmath150 , which are disfavored by the global analysis of the unitarity triangle @xcite .",

    "if @xmath74 turns out to be larger than 1 ( i.e. , one third of a standard deviation above its current central value ) , then an interpretation of this result in the standard model would require a large value @xmath152 ( see figure  [ fig : rbound ] ) , which may be difficult to accommodate .",
    "this may be taken as evidence for new physics .",
    "if @xmath153 , one could go a step further and conclude that the new physics must necessarily violate isospin @xcite .",
