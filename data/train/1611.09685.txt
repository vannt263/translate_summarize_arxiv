    "in particular , the dynamics of the transversal ridge instabilities seen with the kmc model on large time and length scales ( compared to the microscopic one of individual hopping events ) is consistent with the transversal instabilities as analysed in the thin - film model : a comparison of the fourier analyses of typical time evolutions of single ridges has shown that in both models one can identify long regimes of exponential growth followed by droplet pinch - off .",

    "likewise , we have demonstrated a qualitative agreement of the evolution pathway in the two - stripe system where in both models an antisymmetric droplet pattern evolves from the transversal instability .",

    "the focus of the present work has been on the qualitative agreement of a stochastic discrete and a deterministic continuum modeling approach in the context of a specific , experimentally relevant system . however , we would like to add a few remarks on the nature of the agreement between the approaches and outline how a quantitative mapping may be reached between averaged kmc simulations and a mesoscopic gradient dynamics ( or thin - film ) model for the evolution of the film height profile .    as already emphasized in the introduction , to reach a quantitative correspondence between the two models",
    "is a non - trivial task , since the underlying physical assumptions about the system are not identical .",
    "while the kmc model assumes a diffusive dynamics with exclusively short - ranged particle interactions , the thin - film model is derived from the standard equation for overdamped hydrodynamics , namely the stokes equation .",
    "a first step in order to achieve a quantitative mapping between the models would be to map the models in terms of their equilibrium behaviour , i.e. , their statics / energetics .",
    "here , one may consider a mean field approximation of the kmc model in terms of a classical lattice density functional theory ( dft ) approximation .",
    "this could be done for the case of different homogeneous substrates to then apply the results to the heterogeneous case .",
    "in @xcite , it is shown how one is able to extract the interface tension and the effective wetting potential from appropriate lattice dft theories with different interaction ranges ( cf .",
    "@xcite for an alternative approach via a molecular dynamics md simulations ) . the resulting interface hamiltonian ( or free energy ) is then incorporated into a mesoscopic continuum theory in gradient dynamics form and it is shown that height profiles of mean field droplets obtained from the lattice dft are accurately reproduced . as explained above , the effective wetting potential directly gives the derjaguin ( or disjoining ) pressure that appears in the thin - film equation .",
    "such a mapping on a purely energetic level does not only allow one to investigate static ridge and droplet states but also to assess their stability either via a second variation of the free energy or via a dynamical approach .",
    "for the latter one assumes that the dynamics follows a gradient dynamics on the interface hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , for a thin - film equation like eq .",
    "( [ thinfilmequation ] ) , @xcite shows that the threshold of the transversal instability is entirely encoded in the energy functional . to fully account for the dynamics one needs to take a further step and extract from stochastic discrete models as the kmc model the full mobility functions that enter the thermodynamic fluxes in the gradient dynamics form of the thin - film type model eq .",
    "( [ thinfilmequation ] ) . this could be done by a direct numerical fitting process or analytically , starting from a cahn - hilliard type dynamical mean field model such as the one discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the employed stochastic model(s ) should allow for the extraction of all effective transport parameters , i.e. , diffusion constant , slip length and viscosity to fully account for transport by diffusion at very small ( sub - monolayer ) film height and by advection at larger film height .",

    "<S> we employ kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations and a thin - film continuum model to comparatively study the transverse ( i.e. , plateau - rayleigh ) instability of ridges formed by molecules on pre - patterned substrates . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the evolution of the occurring instability qualitatively agrees between the two models for a single ridge as well as for two weakly interacting ridges . in particular , it is shown for both models that the instability occurs on well defined length and time scales which are , for the kmc model , significantly larger than the intrinsic scales of thermodynamic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is further evidenced by the similarity of dispersion relations characterising the linear instability modes . </S>"
