    "since its theoretical prediction in 1973 @xcite and experimental discovery in 1977 @xcite , the bottom quark has been serving as a unique probe in studying various aspects of modern particle physics .",
    "special b factories , e.g. , babar and belle , were built and established cp violation in mesons involving @xmath2 quarks ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) . moreover , a dedicated lhc experiment , lhcb , aimed to further improve our knowledge of the origin of cp violation , was set up at cern .",
    "another important point is new physics ( np ) , which can manifest itself in rare ( flavor - violating ) decays of b mesons .",
    "the latter , being suppressed in the standard model ( sm ) , are very sensitive to contributions from beyond - the - sm ( bsm ) theories and at the moment play a very important role in constraining parameter spaces of np scenarios .",
    "finally , both the sm higgs boson and the top quark prefer to decay into @xmath2 quarks . due to this ,",
    "the properties of the bottom quark deserve to be carefully investigated and analyzed .",
    "theoretical descriptions of the above - mentioned processes usually involve several different scales , ranging from the long - distance ( qcd ) scale @xmath7  gev over the electroweak ( ew ) scale @xmath8  gev up to np scales @xmath9  gev ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "since the scales are well separated , one can make use of effective field theories ( efts ) ( see , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and `` factorize '' physics relevant to strong ( long - distance ) qcd dynamics , which are difficult to calculate , yet not very interesting from the fundamental point of view , from short - distance effects due to ew or np interactions .    in the sm ,",
    "the @xmath2-quark mass is generated via the higgs mechanism due to the yukawa interaction of the @xmath2 quark with the higgs field condensate @xmath10 .",
    "however , a well - known fact is that strong interactions prevent quarks from being observed as `` free '' particles , so that the notion of physical mass is ill - defined in this case ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in such a situation , one can choose a convenient mass definition depending on the problem considered .",
    "among these definitions are the pole mass @xmath4 @xcite , the running mass @xmath1 and various `` threshold '' masses , such as the 1s mass @xmath11 @xcite , the potential - subtracted ( ps ) mass @xmath12 @xcite , the renormalon - subtracted ( rs ) mass @xmath13 @xcite , etc .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in principle",
    ", all these mass parameters can be related to each other and to the yukawa coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the latter enters the fundamental sm lagrangian and is definitely very important for precise theoretical predictions both of @xmath14-hadron decay properties and the sm higgs decay width .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the direct measurement of the @xmath2-quark yukawa coupling is very challenging @xcite .",
    "the estimated uncertainty for the lhc is about 20% , and a linear collider is needed to reduce it by an order of magnitude @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the problem of the extraction of the running ) scheme .",
    "] yukawa coupling @xmath15 in the sm from a @xmath2-quark mass parameter .",
    "our goal is to improve a well - established relation between @xmath15 and @xmath4 @xcite at the two - loop order of perturbation theory ( pt ) by trading the ill - defined pole mass for a short - distance mass parameter @xmath16 defined in the @xmath0 renormalization scheme .",
    "the latter plays the role of an independent lagrangian parameter of the qcd eft with five active quark flavors , which is valid significantly below the ew scale .",
    "this mass parameter is not sensitive to long - distance physics and can be extracted from experiment with much higher precision .",
    "the value of @xmath17  gev quoted by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite will be used here as an input for the determination of @xmath15 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : running_mass_in_sm ] , we consider various definitions of running quark mass , all of which are proportional to the running yukawa couping @xmath15 , but differ from each other by the treatment of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath18 . in section",
    "[ sec : matching ] , we describe our procedure , which allows us to obtain the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath19 at a certain ( matching ) scale @xmath20 . section  [ sec : numerics ] is devoted to our numerical analysis of different corrections to this relation and the comparison of the latter with the corresponding contributions to the @xmath5-@xmath4 relation . finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , some discussions and conclusions can be found . in [ sec : eft_rge ] , three - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the qcd@xmath3qed effective theory , utilized to relate the values of @xmath21 and @xmath19 , are presented . in [ sec : zm_nm ] , we also include the three - loop relation between the running mass @xmath22 and @xmath4 in six - flavor qcd , with the account of the heavy top quark .",
    "the latter can be used to extract the running mass of the @xmath2 quark in the sm from its given pole mass .",
    "fermion masses are not fundamental parameters of the sm lagrangian , but are induced in the spontaneously broken phase and are proportional to the corresponding yukawa couplings : @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting leptons and quarks , respectively .",
    "the higgs field expectation value @xmath18 corresponds to a minimum of the full effective potential @xmath25 @xcite for the neutral component of the higgs doublet @xmath26 , @xmath27 the vev @xmath18 is a nonperturbative quantity that should be a function of fundamental sm lagrangian parameters , i.e. , dimensionless gauge and yukawa couplings together with the higgs self - coupling @xmath28 and mass @xmath29 from the tree - level higgs potential @xmath30 .",
    "the fact that @xmath18 corresponds to a minimum guarantees the absence of `` tadpoles , '' which are nothing but @xmath31 .",
    "this simple picture is spoiled by several `` technical '' obstacles .",
    "first of all , it is very difficult to calculate @xmath32 beyond the tree - level and to find an analytic expression for @xmath18 .",
    "another well - known issue is the gauge dependencies @xcite of @xmath32 ( away from extrema ) and the field value @xmath18 at its minimum . due to this , various approximations for @xmath18 are on the market , which may lead to different pt series if expressed in terms of dimensionless running couplings and @xmath33 .    from the practical point of view , it is possible to avoid the explicit calculation of @xmath32 by adjusting the definitions of the parameters ( equivalently , the counterterms ) to cancel tadpoles order by order ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the on - shell formulation ) .",
    "one can distinguish two , yet related , options ( for a comprehensive discussion , see also refs .",
    "the first option is to write @xmath34 and move terms due to @xmath35 to the interaction part of the sm lagrangian in the broken phase , so that all tree - level masses ( c.f .",
    "are proportional to @xmath36 , which satisfies the tree - level minimization condition , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "the shift @xmath35 can be determined order by order in pt from the requirement that the tree - level tadpole for the neutral higgs field @xmath26 , which can be written as @xmath38 , \\qquad m_h^2 \\equiv 2 \\lambda \\vtree^2 ,      \\label{eq : ltad}\\ ] ] cancels the loop - generated ones . in spite of the fact that the one - point function for the higgs field is zero , in accordance with minimization condition , tadpoles in this scheme manifest themselves in every vertex in which we make the shift @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that such a kind of contributions can be conveniently taken into account by considering one - particle - reducible diagrams in which a neutral - higgs propagator is allowed to be terminated by a tadpole .",
    "this approach was advocated by fleischer and jegerlehner ( fj ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also the recent discussion in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "another prescription , the `` tadpole - free '' scheme , allows one to avoid the explicit introduction of @xmath35 and implicitly assumes that @xmath18 corresponds to a gauge - dependent field value at the minimum of @xmath32 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the tree - level tadpole again precisely cancels the loop - generated ones , but eq .",
    "is rewritten as @xmath40 and there is no explicit contribution due to @xmath35 . due to this ,",
    "the tree - level masses of the would - be goldstone boson @xmath41 and the higgs boson @xmath42 are given by @xmath43 in the broken phase , with @xmath44 . since it is a common choice to assume that all tree - level particle masses in the sm are proportional to a vev , the terms due to @xmath45 in eqs .",
    "are moved from from the quadratic part of sm lagrangian to the interaction part and are traded for loop - generated tadpoles .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that @xmath46-loop contributions to the higgs one - point functions considered in the two above - mentioned approaches , although being formally of the same loop level , are different , due to the fact that they are expressed in terms of different `` tree - level '' running masses . in addition , in the fj scheme , higgs tadpole insertions are allowed , while , in the `` tadpole - free '' scheme , only scalar masses are shifted due to tadpoles .",
    "the advantage of the first option is an explicit control of the gauge dependence of the result , while , in the latter case , the landau gauge , @xmath47 , is usually chosen for the calculation of @xmath32 . in what follows ,",
    "we routinely use the fj tadpole scheme .    for the time being , we say nothing about the utilized regularization and our choice of renormalization scheme .",
    "this is done intentionally , since the reasoning is equally applicable if eqs .",
    " are written in terms of either bare or minimally renormalized parameters . for the fj prescription",
    ", one defines a running vev @xmath48 , the rge for which can be simply obtained from those of the unbroken theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a related quantity , @xmath49 ) , is introduced ( see below ) , and the rges are provided in terms of running masses in the fj tadpole scheme .",
    "all running particle masses are gauge independent in this case and are proportional to @xmath50 @xcite . in addition",
    ", the running higgs mass is directly related to @xmath33 of the unbroken lagrangian , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "one can also define a ( gauge - dependent ) running vev @xmath52 obtained by minimization of the effective potential of the higgs field , renormalized in the @xmath0 scheme at scale @xmath20 , so that @xmath53 .",
    "the scale dependence of @xmath52 is more involved than that of @xmath36 , but , in the landau gauge , it is given by the higgs field anomalous dimension ( see the discussion in refs .",
    "the latter can also be calculated in the unbroken theory .    to summarize , we have discussed the following options to define a running quark mass in the sm renormalized in the scheme :    * gauge - independent running mass @xmath54 : @xmath55 * gauge - dependent running mass @xmath56 : @xmath57    the anomalous dimensions @xmath58 for both quantities , defined as @xmath59 can be expressed as sums of the beta function @xmath60 for @xmath15 and the anomalous dimensions @xmath61 of the corresponding vevs @xmath18 : @xmath62 in the fj case , we have @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the `` tadpole - free '' scheme , there is no such simple relation between the corresponding anomalous dimension and rg functions in a general @xmath66 gauge , but , in landau gauge , we have @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the anomalous dimension of the higgs doublet @xmath69 , computed from the higgs field propagator renormalization constant @xmath70 .",
    "the difference in running between @xmath52 and @xmath50 within the sm was studied numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , contrary to `` tadpole - free '' scheme , all the gauge - fixing parameter dependences of calculable quantities are explicit in the fj approach .",
    "however , the corresponding expressions in the fj scheme involve tadpole contributions , which typically scale like powers of @xmath71 $ ] with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 denoting the masses of the top quark , the @xmath75 boson , and the higgs boson , respectively . in the `` tadpole - free '' scheme , ( most of ) these dangerous terms",
    "are effectively absorbed in @xmath52 .    as was stated earlier",
    ", we routinely use the fj scheme to define running masses .",
    "nevertheless , there is a way to improve the corresponding pt series in a gauge - invariant way by trading @xmath50 for an `` on - shell '' vev , @xmath76 which , by definition , is related to a measured quantity , the fermi constant extracted from muon decay , @xmath77 @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we treat @xmath78 as a non - renormalizable four - fermion coupling of the effective low - energy fermi theory valid at scales much less than the ew one ( for a discussion of different definitions of the fermi constant in the sm , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the relation is motivated by the tree - level matching of the sm to the fermi theory , i.e. , a @xmath75-boson exchange at low momentum transfer leads to @xmath79 where the @xmath75-boson mass is proportional to the su(2 ) gauge coupling @xmath80 .",
    "going beyond the tree - level approximation , one needs to perform a more sophisticated matching by comparing the qed - corrected and , at higher orders , also qcd - corrected muon lifetime in the eft with the corresponding expression in the sm @xcite .",
    "the corrections to the tree - level matching in eq .",
    "are usually accumulated in the quantity @xmath81 @xcite @xmath82    the fermi constant can be treated as a wilson coefficient of an effective non - renormalizable operator , which , in general , can be scale dependent .",
    "we recall that wilson coefficients are indeed scale dependent if the corresponding operator involves four external quarks @xcite .",
    "however , muon decay is described by an effective operator with external leptons , @xmath83 \\left [ \\bar e \\gamma^\\alpha ( 1 - \\gamma_5 ) \\nu_e\\right]$ ] , and the corresponding wilson coefficient turns out to be scale independent due to qed ward ",
    "takahashi identities ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath78 can be treated as a scale - independent `` observable '' in the sm .    if the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is expressed in terms of @xmath0 parameters , one can invert it in pt to express @xmath84 in terms of @xmath78 and other ( dimensionless ) parameters .",
    "again , @xmath18 can be either @xmath50 or @xmath52 .",
