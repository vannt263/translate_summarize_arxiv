    "after more than two decades of intensive studies of high  temperature superconductors ( htscs ) ,  it is now  well accepted that magnetic exchange interactions  in the cuprates play a fundamental role . despite a general lack of consensus on the pairing mechanism in the cuprates , it is believed to be of magnetic origin @xcite . in support of this scenario ,",
    "a direct relationship @xmath2 between @xmath3 and the in - plane exchange interaction @xmath4 was extracted from magnetic measurements for one family of the cuprates in ref .",
    "@xcite . despite vast efforts devoted to understanding the magnetic properties of the cuprates @xcite-@xcite , there are still several important issues which need to be clarified . among them",
    "is the long range nature of the exchange interactions @xmath4  between the cu - ions , and its effect on the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath5 and the critical temperature  t@xmath0 .",
    "studies of model hamiltonians , such as the t  j model show a strong dependence of the calculated properties on the value of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "in particular , numerical calculations suggest a direct relationship  between the magnitude of the magnetic exchange coupling and the pair binding energy@xcite . therefore ,  obtaining accurate estimates for the exchange constants and studying their trends across different htscs including their doping dependence and influence on @xmath1  and t@xmath0  is an interesting problem which we address in the present work .",
    "experiments provide estimates for the magnitude of the exchange interaction , but despite  many studies there is a spread in obtained values even for the nearest  neighbor magnetic coupling @xmath6 in the most studied compound la@xmath7cuo@xmath8 where it varies from 110 to 150 mev @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the latter result does not only depend on the experimental technique being used but also on how the results are fitted , i.e. , depending on whether higher order exchange terms are included .",
    "nevertheless , based on recent  high  resolution inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments , there is an overall agreement that at least for the undoped la@xmath9cuo@xmath8@xcite , a simple nearest ",
    "neighbor heisenberg model is not sufficient and the high - order magnetic exchange interaction is quite important .",
    "however , all high  order terms have similar effects on the spin  wave dispersion and its intensity dependence , therefore , even ins , the most powerful technique for exploring magnetic excitations , can not determine the magnetic exchange coupling very accurately .",
    "worse than la@xmath9cuo@xmath8 , for most other htsc compounds , the difficulty in synthesizing large single crystals limits the capability of performing accurate measurements .",
    "thus , the experimental  information on the exchange interactions is very limited .",
    "in addition to the experiment , the magnetic interactions of the undoped cuprates have been studied in a number of theoretical works@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , most of them use a cluster approximation and map the total energy differences obtained by a first principle calculation to a model hamiltonian which prevents detailed studies of the long range nature of the @xmath4 s .",
    "it is , for example , well known that the long  range hopping integrals are very important for the electronic properties in the cuprates@xcite and even the effective third nearest neighbor hopping t \"  has a considerable effect on the interatomic exchange@xcite .",
    "therefore it is desirable to re - investigate the exchange interaction in cuprates by a first principle calculation .",
    "in contrast to the undoped cuprates , investigations of @xmath4 s in doped htscs are scarce , regardless the superconductivity actually happens only after introducing doping . based on a model calculation , si",
    "et al . _ , suggested that @xmath10 will decrease rapidly with doping@xcite . on the other hand , the commonly used t ",
    "j model uses the same @xmath4 for different doping levels@xcite , therefore study the effect of doping on the exchange interaction based on a first principle calculation is quite interesting . unfortunately , _ ab initio _ techniques for extracting @xmath4 s ( like the cluster approximations mentioned above ) are not efficient for the doped case , and there are no extensive calculations of this type reported in the literature . in this work",
    ", we use a recently developed linear response approach @xcite , and perform detailed studies of exchange interactions for both parent and doped htscs . beyond this , we  also investigate the effect of the long  range j s  on the spin susceptibility @xmath11 and the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath0 within the framework of the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) for the t  j model .",
    "we perform our electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory ( dft )  within the full potential linearized - muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) method@xcite . to take into account the effect of the on  site electron ",
    "electron interaction we supplement the local density approximation ( lda ) to dft by adding a correction due to hubbard u using so  called lda+u approach@xcite , with the parameters u@xmath1210 ev and j@xmath121.20 ev for the cu @xmath13 orbitals as deduced from the constrained lda calculation@xcite .",
    "experimental lattice parameters have been used for all materials .    with the electronic structure information",
    ", one can evaluate the magnetic exchange parameters @xmath4  of a heisenberg model @xmath14 based on a magnetic force theorem@xcite which assumes a rigid rotation of atomic spin . in this formalism , the interatomic exchange constant @xmath4 is given as a second derivative of the total energy difference induced by the rotation of moments at sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17_{\\alpha } |\\psi _ { \\mathbf{% \\text{k}+q}j^{^{\\prime } } } \\rangle   \\notag \\\\ & \\times & \\langle \\psi _ { \\mathbf{\\text{k}+q}j^{^{\\prime } } } |[\\sigma \\times   \\mathbf{b}_{\\tau ^{^{\\prime } } } ] _ { \\beta } |\\psi _ { \\mathbf{\\text{k}}j}\\rangle e^{i\\mathbf{\\text{q}}\\cdot ( \\mathbf{\\text{r}}-\\mathbf{\\text{r}^{^{\\prime } } } % ) } ,   \\label{j}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and * b * are the fermi function , pauli matrix , and the effective magnetic field in the calculation given by the difference in the electronic self - energies for spin - up and spin - down electrons , respectively .",

    "1 ) decrease rapidly with increasing distance between two cu ions . after taking into account the effect of quantum renormalizationrenormalization , the measurement of two  magnon raman scattering gives @xmath27=116 mev@xcite , which is slightly larger than our numerical @xmath27 ( 109 mev ) as shown in table i. early neutron scattering experiments give a larger value of @xmath28130 mev@xcite@xcite , which may be partially due to the use of only a nearest ",
    "neighbor heisenberg model to fit their spin - wave velocities .",
    "our @xmath10 agrees very well with one cluster calculation ( 105 mev)@xcite but is smaller than the result of other calculations ( @xmath29140 mev)@xcite .",
    "turning to the discussion of the next nearest neighbor coupling , our calculated @xmath25 is slightly larger than the one deduced from neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the early cluster calculationstheory lco-3 , our @xmath25 is ferromagnetic ( fm ) and thus enhances the antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "since well  defined spin  wave excitations throughout the brillouin zone have been observed by the ins@xcite , it is interesting to perform the comparisons with our calculated spin  wave dispersions . for cuprates the quantum fluctuations",
    "may  be large due to the smallness of the spin s=@xmath30 and the low dimensionality d=2 .",
    "on the basis of the holstein ",
    "primakoff transformation using 1/s expansion , it has been found that a renormalization factor is necessary for the spin  wave excitation energy@xcite in order to compare it with the result of standard linear spin ",
    "wave theory@xcite . with this correction ,",
    "the spin  wave dispersion can be expressed as : @xmath31where @xmath32-j_{3}[1-\\frac{% 1}{2}(\\cos ( 4\\pi q_{x})+\\cos ( 4\\pi q_{y}))],$ ] @xmath33,$ ] and @xmath34 is the renormalization factor , respectively .",
    "here based on the above formula with the quantum renormalization factor @xmath34=1.18@xcite , and using the obtained numerical @xmath10 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , we calculate the spin  wave dispersion for la@xmath9cuo@xmath8 , and display the result in fig.2 by the solid line . for comparison , in fig .",
    "2 we also show the ins data by symbols@xcite .",
    "our results agree well with the experiments near the zone center .",
    "a small discrepancy exists around the zone boundary which may be due to the  four  particle cyclic exchange interaction @xmath35 which recently attracted much attention@xcite .",
    "the triangles and squares are the experimential results at t=10 k and 295 k , respectively @xcite.,height=240 ]    we now turn to our predictions of exchange interactions for other htsc materials where the experimental values of @xmath4 are limited .",
    "the experiment@xcite@xcite shows the @xmath10 of sr@xmath9cuo@xmath9cl@xmath9 is about 10 mev smaller than that of la@xmath9cuo@xmath8 .",
    "this is reproduced by our numerical calculation as shown in table i. the @xmath10 of yba@xmath9cu@xmath36o@xmath37 has been measured by neutron scattering , and the obtained value is about 120 mev@xcite@xcite . after considering the quantum renormalization effect@xcite , the experimental @xmath38 will be reduced to 100 mev , which is very close to our numerical result 93 mev .",
    "it is interesting to note that our theoretical study reproduces the experimental trend  across the materials studied ( la@xmath9cuo@xmath39 has largest @xmath10 , sr@xmath9cuo@xmath9cl@xmath9 is intermediate , and @xmath27 in yba@xmath9cu@xmath40o@xmath41 is smallest@xcite@xmath42 ) as it is seen from table i ,  all parent htscs have almost the same @xmath10 ( around 110 mev ) regardless of their number of cuo@xmath9 layers and their different t@xmath0 s .",
    "@xmath25 is also similar and shows fm  behavior while @xmath26 is afm like . using the quantum renormalization factor@xcite and linear spin  wave theory ,",
    "we also calculate the spin  wave dispersion for all other compounds and show the results for hgba@xmath9cacu@xmath9o@xmath41 , sr@xmath7cuo@xmath9cl@xmath9 and yba@xmath9cu@xmath40o@xmath41 in fig.3 .",
    "since different compound have similar exchange interactions the shape of the spin  wave curve is quite similar while yba@xmath9cu@xmath40o@xmath41  has smaller spin  wave excitation .",

    "applying pressure reduces the lattice parameter , and , as a result , increases the magnitude of @xmath4 , but this enhancement is too weak to relate it with rising t@xmath0 .",
    "for example , we find the values of @xmath10 are 114.3 and 116.4 mev at 3 and 8 gpa , respectively , which is very close to the value at ambient pressure as shown in table i.      it is believed that the apical oxygen has a dramatic effect on t@xmath0apical o 1,apical o 2,andersen prl , w.ku .",
    "however , there is a debate on whether t@xmath0 is positively correlated with the magnitude of the effective next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath44 @xcite , or if an intersite super - repulsion term is important @xcite .",
    "we therefore study the effect of the position of the apical oxygen on the exchange interaction . the apical oxygen in la@xmath9cuo@xmath8 is located at the ( 0,0,z@xmath45 ) site . by adjusting the internal atomic coordinate z@xmath45  we perform the calculation for different distances d@xmath46 between the apical oxygen and cu .",
    "our results are shown in table ii .",
    "in contrast to the hopping integral , which is quite sensitive to the position of the apical oxygen@xcite , the magnitude of the exchange interaction in the cuo@xmath9 plane only slightly increases with d@xmath46  as shown in table ii . in the hg - based cuprates with d@xmath47   @xmath4",
    "is found smaller than the one in la@xmath9cuo@xmath8  with the same d@xmath46 , so it is likely that the exchange interaction is more sensitive to the detail of the electronic structure , rather than just to the distance d@xmath46 .",
    ".experimental @xmath48 ( k ) , and calculated exchange interactions ( mev )  for parent htsc materials .",

    "now , we aim to address the following questions : ( 1 ) can the variation in exchange parameters for different materials explain the difference in @xmath50 ? ( 2 ) what is the effect of varying exchange parameters on the dynamic spin fluctuation spectrum ? to answer these questions , we use a dynamic cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite to calculate the properties of a t - j model .",
    "a similar study was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    ", a combined dft - lda and dca - qmc approach was used to study the parameter dependence of @xmath50 in a three - band hubbard model .",
    "these calculations showed that @xmath50 is a very strong function of the hopping parameters , and very sensitive to even small variations in the long - range hopping integrals .    here , we want to study the dependence of @xmath50 on the exchange parameters @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore consider a two - dimensional t ",
    "j model @xmath51where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a projected fermion operator defined as @xmath54 .",
    "the general idea of the dca is to map the bulk lattice problem onto an effective periodic cluster embedded in a self  consistent dynamic host designed to represent the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "correlations within the cluster are treated explicitly , while those beyond the cluster size are treated on the mean  field level .",
    "the hybridization of the cluster to the host accounts for fluctuations arising from the coupling between the cluster and the rest of the system .",
    "the mean - field nature of the approach allows us to study transitions to symmetry broken phases such as the superconducting state even in small clusters .",
    "for example , using a dynamic cluster quantum monte carlo approximation for a small four  site 2@xmath552 cluster , the properties of a 2d hubbard model were calculated in ref .",
    "the obtained phase - diagram is remarkably similar to the universal cuprate phase diagram , exhibiting antiferromagnetic and @xmath13-wave superconducting phases as well as pseudogap behavior . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a four  site cluster dca calculation provides a mean - field result for the transition to a superconducting state with a @xmath56-wave order parameter .",
    "dca calculations for larger cluster sizes show a reduction in the superconducting @xmath50 due to the inclusion of pair - field phase fluctuations , but the qualitative aspects of the results including the pairing mechanism are similar to the four  site cluster results @xcite .    here",
    ", we have used a non  crossing approximation maier : edca , maier : dcanca , haule07 ( nca ) to determine the spin susceptibility @xmath5 and @xmath48 for a four  site 2@xmath552 cluster .",

    "@xmath50 is determined by the temperature where the the anomalous green s function vanishes .",
    "similar calculations for fixed near - neighbor exchange integral @xmath57 were performed in ref .",
    "many results of this study were shown to be reminiscent of experiments in the cuprates . here , we focus on the effect of varying longer - ranged exchange parameters on the spin - susceptibility and the superconducting @xmath50",

    "consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : pairint ] ) , one finds that the magnitude of @xmath48 tracks the magnitude of the spectral weight in @xmath77 for @xmath60 .",

    "note , however , that the third  nearest neighbor exchange @xmath26 is not directly represented on a 4site 2@xmath552 cluster . in this approximation ,",
    "the spins on the cluster only know about @xmath26 through their effective coupling to the spin  fluctuation host .",
    "therefore , it is possible that larger variations in @xmath48 would be found in larger cluster simulations .",
    "> from the present results , however , we conclude that the differences in the long  ranged exchange terms can not explain the differences in @xmath48 between different cuprates .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the magnetic exchange interactions for a series of htsc cuprates using the lda+u based linear response approach .",
    "our calculated spin wave dispersions were found in good agreement with high - resolution  inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "our simulations show that for different parent htscs ,  the nearest neighbor and next  nearest neighbor exchange constants are similar , while the third nearest neighbor @xmath4 appears to be material dependent .",
    "furthermore , we find that @xmath10 is insensitive to the hole doping , which agrees with recent experiments and supports the implicit assumption of the t  j model with a fixed magnitude of @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to the hopping integral , which strongly depends on the position of the apical oxygen , our results show that the magnetic exchange  interaction is rather insensitive to the position of the apical oxygen . in addtion to the lda+u calculations , we studied the dependence of the dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath5 and superconducting transition temperature t@xmath0 on the exchange parameters in a t  j model using a dynamic cluster approximation .",
    "we find that both @xmath1 and @xmath48 are only weakly affected by variations in the exchange parameters beyond nearest neighbor .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that differences in long - range exchange terms between different materials can not explain their different superconducting transition temperatures .",
