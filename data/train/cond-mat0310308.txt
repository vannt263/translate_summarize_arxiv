    "<S> motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in layered na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o compound , we investigate theoretically the spin dynamics in the superconducting state with three possible @xmath3- , @xmath4- , and @xmath5-wave pairing symmetries in two - dimensional triangular lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a spin resonance peak , which is elaborated to have a close relevance to the relative phase of the gap function and the geometry of the fermi surface , appears in both in - plane and out - of - plane components of the spin susceptibility @xmath6 for the spin - singlet @xmath4-wave pairing , while only in the out - of - plane(in - plane ) component of @xmath6 for the spin - triplet @xmath3-wave ( @xmath5-wave ) pairing . because the pairing symmetry in this compound is still hotly debated at present , this distinct feature may be used to probe or determine it unambiguously with future neutron scattering experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the superconductivity with @xmath7k is found in the coo@xmath2-layered material , na@xmath0coo@xmath8h@xmath2o  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this compound consists of two - dimensional(2d ) coo@xmath2 layers where co atoms form a 2d triangular lattice and is separated by a thick insulating layer of na@xmath9 ions and h@xmath2o molecules . </S>",
    "<S> although its @xmath10 is relatively low , it has still attracted much attention because it shares some similarities with high-@xmath10 cuprates , in particular it may be another unconventional superconductor evolving from the doped mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the investigation of this compound is expected to give insight on the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity . so far , </S>",
    "<S> several quite different theoretical proposals  @xcite for its pairing symmetry , such as the spin - singlet @xmath4-wave and the spin - triplet @xmath3-(or even @xmath5-)wave , have been put forward . on the other hand , experimental results on the pairing symmetry reported by different group </S>",
    "<S> have also been controversial , even with the same experimental method  @xcite .    in unconventional @xmath11- and @xmath12-wave superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> the gap function @xmath13 changes the sign(phase ) around the fermi surface and thus would lead to zeros(nodes ) in the superconducting(sc ) energy gap @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can in principle determine the gap function and consequently the pairing symmetry , by measuring the distribution of the phase and/or node positions . in practice , it is the node positions rather than the phase that can be inferred in usual thermodynamic , transport , and nmr experiments . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the probe of the node position has been mostly used in the clarification of the pairing symmetry in unconventional superconductors  @xcite . however , the much debated pairing symmetries so far proposed for the sc state of na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o are the broken - time - reversal - symmetry @xmath4- and @xmath3- waves . in this case , the energy gap @xmath15 is nodeless . </S>",
    "<S> so , a probe which is directly related to the phase is of special importance for the determination of the pairing symmetry in this compound as well as in other unconventional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this is evident by noting the crucial impact of the tricrystal phase - sensitive experiment  @xcite on the determination of the dominating @xmath16 pairing symmetry in high-@xmath10 superconductors . in this letter , by noting that a spin resonance peak appears in different components of the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath6 for all three possible pairing symmetries in the 2d triangular lattice with the nearest - neighbor(n.n . ) </S>",
    "<S> pairing interaction , we show that the identification of the spin resonance peak in the sc state , which can be carried out by neutron scattering experiments , may also provide an unambiguous clue to probe / determine the pairing symmetry in this compound . </S>",
    "<S> we elaborate that the occurrence of the spin resonance peak in a specific component of the dynamical spin susceptibility exclusively corresponds to a _ </S>",
    "<S> definite _ change of the phase of @xmath13 .    to handle both the spin - singlet and spin - triplet superconductivity in the same model as well as to capture the essential physics of electron correlation </S>",
    "<S> , we employ a phenomenological @xmath17 model  @xcite on a 2d triangular lattice , in which an effective n.n . pairing interaction ( @xmath18 ) is responsible for superconductivity and an on - site hubbard @xmath19 for the electron correlation . after choosing the mean - field parameter @xmath20 , we can write the effective hamiltonian as , @xmath21+u\\sum_{i}n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{<ij </S>",

    "<S> note that the actual superconducting pairing mechanism is still unclear at present and thus is not specified in this phenomenological model .    in the triangular lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion of quasiparticles is @xmath22-\\mu\\ ] ] for 2d triangular lattices with the n.n . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting pairing interaction , only @xmath23-wave , @xmath24-wave , and @xmath5-wave pairing states may exist  @xcite : i ) @xmath25+i{\\sqrt3 }    \\sin(k_{x}/2)\\sin({\\sqrt3}k_{y}/2)\\}$ ] , ii ) @xmath26+i{\\sqrt3 } \\cos(k_{x}/2)\\sin({\\sqrt3}k_{y}/2)\\}$ ] , and iii ) @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> given the attractive interaction @xmath18 and with @xmath28  @xcite , the mean - field calculation of eq.(1 ) shows that nearly degenerate singlet @xmath4- and triplet @xmath5-wave solutions are favored at doping @xmath29 , while the triplet @xmath3-wave is stable at @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the average electron number per site  @xcite . in order to compare the results for different pairing symmetries with roughly the same sc gap , </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen @xmath32 for @xmath29 and @xmath33 for @xmath30 , which gives @xmath34 for @xmath5-wave , @xmath35 for @xmath36-wave ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath37 for @xmath38-wave ( @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effective on - site hubbard interaction is assumed to be @xmath39  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> near @xmath49 , only the first term in eq.(3 ) with the coherence factor @xmath50 , involving the creation of quasiparticle pairs , contributes to the spin susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> an essential difference in the coherence factors between the spin - singlet pairing(or the component @xmath51 for spin - triplet pairing ) and the component @xmath52 for spin - triplet pairing is a sign difference in front of re@xmath53 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this sign difference is the key point for our later discussions .    </S>",
    "<S> the many - body correction to the spin susceptibility is included by the random phase approximation  @xcite . in this way , </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized spin susceptibility is given by , @xmath54^{-1}.\\ ] ]    the momentum dependences of the dynamical spin susceptibility for @xmath55 in the sc state ( @xmath56 ) are presented in fig.1 . for the @xmath3-wave pairing , a peak near @xmath57 can be seen . while , for the @xmath5-wave and @xmath4-wave pairings , a peak near @xmath58 appears . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious feature , seen from the figure , is that these peaks depend only on the doping density and is irrespective of the symmetry of the pairing spin state and the components of im@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that these peaks arise from the nesting of fermi surface which is determined only by the doping . </S>",
    "<S> the nesting wavevectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 which correspond to these two peaks are denoted as dashed lines with arrows in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a much sharper peak occurs around @xmath61 for the in - plane component im@xmath52 in the case of the spin - triplet pairing . </S>",
    "<S> this peak already presents in the normal state(not shown here ) and reflects an enhanced ferromagnetic fluctuations which may arise from the substantial density of state at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is suppressed highly for spin - singlet pairing and for the out - of - plane component in the spin - triplet pairing as shown in fig.1 . in fig.3(a ) , we present the frequency dependence of im@xmath6 at @xmath59 for the spin - triplet @xmath3-wave pairing . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that a spin resonance peak occurs near @xmath62 for the out - of - plane component im@xmath51 , but is absent for the in - plane component im@xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in sharp contrast , the spin resonance peak appears in the in - plane component of im@xmath52 rather than in the out - of - plane component for the spin - triplet @xmath5-wave pairing(fig.3(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the spin resonance peak can be found in both components for @xmath4 pairing , via the relation @xmath63 which holds for a spin - singlet state . </S>",
    "<S> these distinctly different features for all three possible pairing states are significantly important because they may be used as an unambiguous clue to probe / determine experimentally the pairing symmetry in this compound .    to understand our observation clearly , we plot the bare spin susceptibility im@xmath64 in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that a peak is evident at the spin gap edge followed by a step - like decrease just below the gap edge in the channels in which there is a spin resonance peak . using the kramers - kroenig relation , </S>",
    "<S> we will obtain a logarithmic singularity in its real part re@xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rpa correction will further magnify this effect and lead to a sharp peak near the gap edge . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that a peak just above the spin gap edge is the source of the spin resonance .    from the bcs theory , </S>",
    "<S> the density of states(dos ) is divergent just above the sc gap edge , which is expected to affect some physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect is limited by the coherence factor . the most evident effect of the coherence factor [ eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) ] is for energies @xmath66 and @xmath67 near the quasiparticle gap edge @xmath68 , in which it is either @xmath69 or @xmath70 , depending on the relative sign of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , @xmath50 is negligible unless @xmath71 and @xmath72 are of opposite signs for the spin - singlet pairing  @xcite and for the out - of - plane component in the spin - triplet pairing , or of the same sign for the in - plane component in the spin - triplet pairing . with these general considerations , </S>",
    "<S> let us now address why a peak appears in one component of the spin susceptibility , but is absent in the other . in fig.2 , we plot the phase(@xmath73 sign denotes the phase @xmath74 , @xmath75 sign the phase @xmath76 ) and node position(dotted lines ) for various terms of the three possible pairing symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface for @xmath30 , where the @xmath3-wave is favored , is a circle around @xmath77 point . for either the @xmath78 or @xmath79 term </S>",
    "<S> , the two half circles separated by the line nodes will have the opposite(different ) sign(phase ) of the gap function @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for the wave vector @xmath81 , @xmath71 and @xmath82 have the opposite sign . according to eqs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) , the coherence factor @xmath50 is appreciable for @xmath42 and vanishes for @xmath44 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the dos peak shows up in the out - of - plane component im@xmath51 and does not in the in - plane component im@xmath52 , as shown in fig.4(a ) . also for the spin - triplet pairing but with the @xmath5-wave , @xmath71 and @xmath83 connected by @xmath58 are of the same sign(phase)[fig.2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dos peak exists in im@xmath52 , instead of in im@xmath51[fig.4(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the most definite demonstration of this argument can be found in the case of the @xmath4 wave , where an appreciable coherence factor @xmath50[eq.(4 ) ] requires that @xmath71 and @xmath72 have the opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> however , from fig.2 one can see that , though the @xmath71 s connected by wave vector @xmath59 satisfy the requirement for the @xmath84 term , those for the @xmath11 term do not . to see their effect , we have calculated the results for @xmath11 and @xmath84 terms , separately . as shown in the inset of fig.3(b ) , we find no peak for the @xmath11-wave term , but a sharp peak for the @xmath84-wave term . </S>",
    "<S> remembering that the term re@xmath85=\\delta^{d}_{k}\\delta^{d}_{k+q}+\\delta^{d'}_{k}\\delta^{d'}_{k+q}$ ] , one will expect that it is the effect of @xmath84 term dominates for the @xmath4 wave . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference between the cases of @xmath11- and @xmath84-wave pairings is their sign ( phase ) of the gap function . </S>",
    "<S> so , it shows definitely that the spin resonance peak depends _ uniquely _ on the relative phase of the gap functions connected by the transition wave vector , when the fermi surface is given . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the spin resonance peak appears in specific components of the dynamical spin susceptibility with distinctly different ways for the proposed possible pairing states . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that neutron scattering experiments can probe the above mentioned spin resonance peak , as done for high-@xmath10 cuprates  @xcite , and thus to identify the pairing symmetry of na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o superconductors .    before concluding the paper , </S>",
    "<S> let us use the above idea to address the anisotropic suppression of the spin response at @xmath86 shown in fig.1 . at @xmath87 , the two gap functions connected by @xmath88 will surely have the same phase . </S>",
    "<S> so , the coherence factor @xmath50 will be negligible for the spin - singlet pairing and the out - of - plane component of the spin - triplet pairing , but it is not for the in - plane component . </S>",
    "<S> thus , comparing with that in the normal state and in the latter case , the spin response in the former case is strongly suppressed .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the spin resonance peak exists in distinctly different ways for three possible pairing symmetries proposed for newly discovered coo@xmath2 layer materials na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o , and suggested to use it as an unambiguous clue to probe / determine the pairing symmetry in future inelastic neutron scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have elaborated that the spin resonance peak has a close relevance to the relative phase of the gap function and the geometry of the fermi surface .    </S>",
    "<S> after the completion of this work , we noticed a preprint  @xcite by li and jiang , in which a spin resonance peak was predicted only for the spin - singlet @xmath4-wave pairing in the framework of the @xmath89 model on triangular lattices and by using the slave - boson approach . </S>",
