    "the wall - crossing in four - dimensional supersymmetric theory @xcite has been a subject of interests to many string theorists and mathematicians .",
    "this phenomenon of discontinuity in the bps spectrum across walls of marginal stability , as one changes either parameters or vacuum expectation value of a theory , has been a source of enormous difficulty in understanding the detailed structure of theories like @xmath6 seiberg - witten theories and calabi - yau compactified type ii string theories .    for bps states in four - dimensional theories ,",
    "this phenomenon has been understood in various physical viewpoints , such as from geometric realization of bps states in string theory @xcite , from solitonic dynamics @xcite and quantum bound states thereof @xcite , from a classical soliton picture of the low energy effective theory @xcite , and also later from supergravity attractor flow @xcite . from the spacetime viewpoint ,",
    "the wall - crossing occurs simply because the wavefunction of the bps state in question becomes so large ( as one approaches a wall of marginal stability ) that the state in question can not be regarded as a one - particle state anymore @xcite . despite this simple and compelling physical picture , a systematic and practical approach to the wall - crossing phenomenon which can cover all part of the moduli space had not been available .",
    "recently , there appeared a new remarkable development in this regard .",
    "it states that such discontinuities of spectrum across walls of marginal stability is actually necessary for the continuity of the vacuum moduli space metric .",
    "according to gaiotto , moore and neitzke ( gmn ) @xcite , the continuity of the vacuum moduli space metric of @xmath7-compactified seiberg - witten theory implies the so - called kontsevich - soibelman relations @xcite among bps dyons across any given wall of marginal stability , which in turn tells us how the bps spectra would change across such walls .",
    "cecotti and vafa @xcite has recently suggested another interesting explanation of kontsevich - soibelman s formulae with spin refinement @xcite , using the partition function of a - model topological string .",
    "while the derivation by gmn was intended for @xmath6 seiberg - witten theory , the idea itself must be applicable to all wall - crossing phenomena .",
    "this new machinary is also important in that for the first time we have a systematic and local prescription for computing bps spectrum .",
    "although there were powerful methods which allowed explicit construction / counting of bps states in certain regions of the moduli space @xcite , this new wall - crossing formula is far more comprehensive in its potential applications .",
    "this observation that discontinuity of bps spectra is related to continuity of some physical quantity has , on the other hand , a previously known analog in the context of two - dimensional @xmath8 theories .",
    "cecotti and vafa @xcite noted some time ago that if one assumes continuity of a twisted partition function @xmath9 throughout parameter space of the theory , this necessarily implies ( dis-)appearance of bps topological kinks across walls of marginal stability . here",
    "@xmath10 is the fermion number , and @xmath11 s are the parameters of the theory .",
    "the above twisted partition is in turn related to the natural metric in the parameter space , and obeys the so - called @xmath12 equation @xcite .",
    "in fact , gmn also noted that some of mathematical structures of @xmath12 equation is very closely mirrored by those that appear in their formulation of the four - dimensional wall - crossing .",
    "independent of this , another interesting similarity between @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath0 @xmath8 theories was noted in the literature : it has been conjectured @xcite that two - dimensional @xmath6 qed with @xmath2 massive chiral multiplets possesses a bps spectrum which is related to that of @xmath13 seiberg - witten theory with @xmath2 massive flavors at the root of the baryonic branch . in view of the new development in the seiberg - witten theory concerning the wall - crossing , and given its analog in @xmath12 system , it is of some interest to clarify the precise correspondence and potential differences . in this article",
    ", we aim to study the two - dimensional theory with care given to precise bps multiplet countings , and compare their wall - crossing phenomena against that of the seiberg - witten theory .",
    "@xmath8 qed with @xmath2 chiral multiplets with twisted masses has been studied much previously .",
    "initial studies by hanany and hori @xcite and also by dorey @xcite concentrated on implications of effective superpotential of the gauge - multiplet and its similarity to certain seiberg - witten spectral curve of @xmath5 theory .",
    "later works @xcite refined this relationship further by giving physical reasonings , if somewhat sketchy , for the correspondence and also looked at @xmath0 spectrum more closely by considering massive excitations of simple kink solutions .    in this paper , we expand on these existing works and solve for all possible flavored kinks .",
    "we give precise criteria for existence of such flavored kink states , set up the low energy dynamics of kinks , count their degeneracies , and provide wall - crossing formula .",
    "this allows a more refined look at the proposed `` equivalence '' of the spectra .",
    "we also hope that it will provide a playground for understanding wall - crossing phenomena in @xmath0 when conserved charged other than the topological ones are present .    in section 2 and 3 , we review the theory and search for all possible kink soliton solutions .",
    "although kinks are simple and well - known objects , global charge allows the variety of kink solutions to increase greatly .",
    "apart from simple `` dyonic '' kinks whose flavor charge is proportional to the topological charge , there are much more flavored kinks whose central charges and stability criteria mimics those of the @xmath4 open string webs @xcite . in section 4 ,",
    "we quantize these solitons , elevate them to quantum bps states , and count their degeneracy .",
    "these bps states exhibit wall - crossing behavior , just as open string web does , which we put in the context of general @xmath0 and @xmath8 theories following cecotti and vafa s results . in section 5",
    ", we compare this spectra to its conjectured counterpart in @xmath5 seiberg - witten theory .",
    "although , the two sides have some common features , essentially due to the open string web analogy , absence of `` angular momentum '' in the @xmath0 theory leads to quantitatively different spectra .",
    "however , a set of distinct dyons with different quark contents are mapped to a single type of favored kink ; interestingly , if one sum over the relevant indices of the former , the result matches precisely with the degeneracy of the flavored kink .",
    "we rely on the four - dimensional wall - crossing formula to reach this conclusion .",
    "we close with conclusion .",

    "after lengthy computations , we finally arrive at wall - crossing issues at large mass limit of this massive @xmath0 qed .",
    "since @xmath313 , there is a wall of marginal stability for these flavored kink at @xmath314 , details of which would follow once we compute the metric and the potential on the moduli space .",

    "the latter two objects exist on both side of this particular wall , so the jump in the spectrum is only for the bound state , and we have the simple jumping formula @xmath317 as we saw in section 2 , the marginal stability wall is , as always , defined by the phase alignment of the two central charges of the flavored @xmath315-kink and the flavored @xmath316-kink .",
    "in fact , this simple wall - crossing formula is a special case of general wall - crossing where we are considering bound states of two bps particles with unit degeneracy . for this , let us review a result from @xcite .",

    "note that , as we vary the parameters of the theory , wall - crossing will occur somewhere and this contribution from single particle bps states will have to be disappear in a discontinuous manner .    on the other hand , @xmath323 also receives contributions from many particle sectors .",
    "in particular , with the decomposition of the central charge as , @xmath324 , the two - particle contribution is of some interests .",
    "following cecotti et.al .",
    ", we also finds that , when the pair of bps states @xmath325 backscatter , what one means by forward - scattering and backward - scattering can be somewhat ambiguous when particles can change species .",
    "however , we are mostly interested in situations when two particles in question are clearly distinct , with different masses for example , so that the particles are unambiguously labeled . in this context",
    ", backscattering means the sign flip of the relative rapidity before and after .",
    "] there is a contribution from the two - particle sector of the type @xmath326 where @xmath327 and @xmath328 are the number of such bps supermultiplets of central charge @xmath325 .",
    "recall that the wall of marginal stability would be at @xmath329 where the two central charges line up in the complex plane .",
    "because of the logarithm , the two - particle expression @xmath330 also has a discontinuous imaginary part , and in fact @xmath331 so that @xmath332 although individual contributions are discontinuous , the twisted partition function @xmath323 itself can be continuous provided that @xmath17 state exists as a one - particle bps state only on the @xmath333 side .",
    "the continuity of the twisted partition function seems reasonable , and this would then imply a rather general wall - crossing behavior .",
    "assuming such a continuity of @xmath334 , and since @xmath335 , we the find the general wall - crossing formula across @xmath336 walls of marginal stability , @xmath337 for flavored domain walls in the massive @xmath338 theory , we found @xmath339 , which is easily explained by this wall - crossing formula , since elementary excitations and simple kinks all have unit index , @xmath340 .",
    "building more complicated flavored kinks out of them can only generate flavored kinks with @xmath340 because the wall - crossing formula ( [ 2dwc ] ) is so simple .",

    "this conjecture was further extended by dorey , hollowood , and tong @xcite .",
    "the most compelling reason for this conjecture comes from the exact central charge ( [ central1 ] ) of the bps states , obtained from effective superpotential @xmath344 after integrating over all chiral multiplets of ( [ glsmlag2 ] ) in the parameter region @xmath345 . in @xcite , it has been pointed out that the periods @xmath346 ( [ central3 ] ) are in perfect matching with those of the seiberg - witten curve at baryonic root of the corresponding @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath13 gauge theory with massive @xmath2 quarks .",
    "this latter observation , strictly speaking , tells us only that the set of central charges in the two theories may coincides , not necessarily the actual particle content . nor does not say much about degeneracies of general bps states on the two sides .",
    "yet , one may go a bit further and hope that at least hypermultiplets of seiberg - witten theory may match against @xmath0 spectra , since these can be potentially massless somewhere in the moduli space ( or parameter space for @xmath0 ) and can be associated with singular structure of the latter .",
    "this is precisely the conjecture of dorey and his collaborators .    now that we found a very rich spectrum of flavored kinks , counted their degeneracy , and found the wall - crossing behavior , let us come back to this conjecture and see how it lives up to its promise .",
    "in generic seiberg - witten theory of rank large than one , typical bps dyons are not in the hypermultiplet .",
    "rather they come with large angular momentum which is already evident in the classical soliton solutions .",

    ", we saw that @xmath428 is the first such hypermultiplet . with flavors present , this need not be true anymore . in fact the original conjecture on equivalence of @xmath0 and @xmath5 spectra relied heavily on the fact that the two theories share the same spectral curve , suggesting that at least hypermultiplet content of @xmath5 theory should be faithfully reflected in @xmath0 theories .",
    "this leads us to guess that the first hypermultiplet is the purely magnetic bound state , @xmath423 , namely a magnetic monopole of charge @xmath429 .",
    "our objective here is to reproduce the rest of bps spectra from this single assumption .",
    "we may naively repeat the analysis of the pure case . from the wall - crossing formula",
    ", we deduce that @xmath430 which , as promised , shows that quarks can bind to a monopole at most once . using the wall - crossing formula one more time , we find @xmath431 note that individual spectra of these dyons are rather nontrivial and come with high angular momentum content .",
    "however , tt is intriguing that the sum of these two indices is rather simple @xmath432 and actually coincides with the @xmath0 counting of flavored kinks , up to a sign .",
    "more generally , for dyons with magnetic charge @xmath368 , the relevant indices are @xmath433 where @xmath434 is a subset of @xmath435 .",
    "the map to @xmath0 flavored kink follows the same rule as before ; these dyons are mapped to flavored @xmath263-kinks with @xmath436-flavor charges @xmath308 being equal to either @xmath437 ( when @xmath438 ) or @xmath439 . summing over the indices for fixed @xmath440 s , we find @xmath441 which is the same as @xmath442 we thus find that under the proposed map ( [ 2d4d ] ) , @xmath0 indices equal precisely to the sum of @xmath5 indices of all corresponding dyons , possibly up to a sign .",
    "note that this cancellation among @xmath5 indices , and the resulting match against @xmath0 index , is possible only upon very fine - tuned relationships among these dyons with different quark contents .",
    "in this paper , we reviewed @xmath0 @xmath8 qed with twisted masses , with emphasis on bps spectra in the large mass limit . with @xmath2 chiral matter fields ,",
    "one finds bps kink solutions endowed with @xmath163 flavor charges , whose stability criteria mimics those of @xmath5 @xmath6 dyons . in the classical limit",
    ", this also coincides with that of open string web , or equivalently 1/4 bps dyons of @xmath164 yang - mills theory , giving us a pictorial way to determine the marginal stability walls .",
    "we quantized these solitons to obtain degeneracies , which turned out to be unit for all such solitons .",
    "this result is consistent with general wall - crossing behavior expected in @xmath0 @xmath8 theories , namely , @xmath443 wall - crossing of @xmath0 topological kinks has been studied in depth where @xmath12 equation makes a prominent appearance .",
    "it would be very interesting to explore further how this could be refined to situations with conserved charges ( such as flavor charges ) other than topological charges .",
    "we also compared the spectrum to the conjectured @xmath5 counterpart , i.e. , that of the @xmath13 seiberg - witten theories with @xmath2 massive fundamental hypermultiplets , at the root of the baryonic branch .",
    "due to the special nature of this point in the moduli space , where the gauge symmetry and the flavor symmetry are locked , one type of flavored kink is mapped to several different kind of dyons with different quark contents .",
    "the degeneracies of the latter , as counted by the second helicity trace , can be complicated and large unlike those of the kinks .",
    "however , this difference is remedied miraculously once we sum over the indices of all the corresponding dyons with different quark content , which gives at the end , latexmath:[\\[\\label{= }    that exists on the left hand side and for all the corresponding dyons on the right hand side .",
    "one can not really say that spectra of the two theories are equivalent , since various dyons that are mapped to one type of flavored kink will generally carry mutually different electric and flavor charges .",
    "note also that in this map only a subset of @xmath5 bps dyons participate . a topological charge of a kink is always mapped to a dual root of the gauge group ;",
    "since general dyons may carry more general ( magnetic ) weight that lie in the dual root lattice , there must be dyons that do not fit in this correspondence .",
    "given such obvious differences , the agreement ( [ = ] ) is all the more remarkable .    the question of whether and how wall - crossing behaviors and indices of @xmath0 theories and those of @xmath5 theories might be related deserves further study .",
    "@xmath5 wall - crossing received much attention lately , as we noted already , and some of mathematical tools there have uncanny resemblance to those of @xmath12 equations . whether such a mathematical resemblance has anything to do with the present example is unclear , but it still begs for a clarification . in particular , the partial agreement ( [ = ] ) of @xmath0 and @xmath5 indices , despite vastly different bps spectra with their different - looking individual indices , needs to be understood better . in a recent study @xcite , gaiotto pointed out a relationship between surface operators in @xmath5 @xmath6 gauge theories and @xmath0 sigma model whose uv theory is @xmath8 qed with massive chiral matters",
