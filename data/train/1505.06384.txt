    "[ fig1 ]    the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) are a very interesting class of layered superconductors that exhibit many features strikingly similar to those seen in the high - transition temperature @xmath16 cuprates , mgb@xmath2 , the organic layered superconductors , the cobaltates , and the iron - based pnictides @xcite .",
    "pristine tmds are constructed from either the octahedral or trigonal prismatic topologically inequivalent t@xmath17 building blocks , as sketched in fig .",
    "1 , where t is a group iv , v , or vi transition metal and @xmath18 is a chalcogen , either s , se , or te@xcite . because of the small differences in formation energies , the tmds form in many polytypes .",
    "the most common polytypes of tise@xmath2 , nbse@xmath2 , and mos@xmath2 are respectively the 1@xmath19 , 2@xmath5(a ) , and 2@xmath5(b ) forms , which respectively consist of identical octahedral layers and two types of trigonal prismatic double layers .",
    "tas@xmath2 also exists in many other polytypes consisting of ordered one - dimensional arrays of these two building blocks . with only a very few exceptions , the tmds exhibit one or more charge - density waves ( cdws ) @xcite , which can even exhibit nodes in their energy gaps @xcite .",
    "one tmd is presently known not to exhibit any cdws , but instead exhibits two distinct superconducting energy gaps .",
    "these features occur in the absence of any observable magnetism .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy have revealed that the cdw and superconducting orderings coexist , and compete for fermi surface and/or saddle band gap formation area in pristine tmds . upon intercalation with a large variety of elements or compounds ,",
    "the cdws are removed , and the resulting superconductors are often extremely anisotropic in their normal and superconducting state properties , even exhibiting clear signs of dimensional - crossover effects .",
    "the tmds are produced in vapor phase transport reactions , by adding either a small amount of @xmath20 or excess chalcogen compositions to the stochiometric elemental mix , to facilitate the vapor phase transport in a two- or three - zone furnace @xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of layers of the two @xmath21 configurations are generally very different . in all",
    "known examples of the 1@xmath19 polytype , such as @xmath0-tas@xmath2 , @xmath0-tis@xmath2 , @xmath0-tise@xmath2 , and @xmath0-vse@xmath2 , the pristine materials were never found to be superconducting at ambient pressure @xcite , and the normal state transport properties were found to be either semiconducting or semi - metallic within the layers at temperatures @xmath19 approaching or above room temperature .",
    "this non - metallic behavior is due to the formation of a cdw that opens up a gap or pseudogap over most of the surprisingly complex fermi surface for @xmath19 in the vicinity of room temperature @xcite , resulting in the complex set of transitions apparent in the in - plane resistivity @xmath22 of @xmath0-tas@xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]    with about 2 gpa of applied pressure , @xmath0-tas@xmath2 becomes superconducting , and with increased pressure , both the mott phase and nearly commensurate cdw are suppressed , and superconductivity persists up to the transition temperature @xmath16  @xmath23  5 k for pressures up to 25 gpa @xcite .    [ fig3 ]    in the @xmath1-tmds , the two layers are in one of two orientations of trigonal prismatic @xmath21 configurations ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and the normal state behavior is considerably more varied than in the @xmath0-tmds . in @xmath1(a)-tas@xmath2 ,",
    "usually written as 2@xmath5-tas@xmath2 , there is only one cdw transition at @xmath24 k , which is weakly first - order , as indicated resistively in fig . 3 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the cdw opens up a gap on the saddle - shaped hole band below @xmath3 , changing the hall constant from positive to negative , @xcite , and the @xmath10-axis resistivity @xmath25 has a minimum followed by a rise as @xmath19 decreases down to @xmath4  @xmath23  0.6 k @xcite , where the compound goes superconducting at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the magnetic susceptibility @xmath26 for @xmath27 decreases sharply and continuously below @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "since no long - range magnetic order was ever detected in this material , this continuous decrease in @xmath26 below @xmath3 can presumably be attributed to the decrease in the density of states on the hole band due to the opening of the cdw gap @xcite .",
    "the first fermi surface measurements on @xmath1-tas@xmath2 were made using de haas shubnikov and de haas van alphen oscillations , indicating that the fermi surface is not as 2d as is that of 4@xmath5(b)-tas@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was shown using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite , that the cdw gap in 2@xmath5-tas@xmath2 actually appears to exhibit a node on the fermi surface , as detailed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]    [ fig5 ]    in @xmath1-tase@xmath2 , an incommensurate cdw forms below 125 k , and the cdw becomes commensurate with the lattice below 90k , but @xmath1-tase@xmath2 also becomes superconducting at @xmath28 k , below which the commensurate cdw and the superconductivity coexist @xcite .",
    "one of the most unusual of the @xmath1-tmds is @xmath1-nbs@xmath2@xcite , which has @xmath29 k @xcite .",
    "most striking is that there is no evidence for any cdws .",
    "the hall constant is positive and nearly independent of @xmath19 for @xmath30 , and there are no anomalies in @xmath22 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "but , since there are two fermi surfaces , neither one of which is gapped by cdws , there might be different superconducting gaps on these different fermi surfaces .",
    "recently , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments were performed on @xmath1-nbs@xmath2 by guillamn _",
    "et al._. the authors did not observe the star - shaped cdw that was found by stm in 2@xmath5-nbse@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , they did observe two superconducting gaps 0.53 and 0.97 mev in magnitude , as shown in fig .",
    "this behavior is similar to that seen in mgb@xmath2 and in pnictide superconductors @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 in @xmath1-nbs@xmath2 was raised from 6 k to 8.9 k by applying 20 gpa of hydrostatic pressure @xcite .",
    "the most studied tmd is 2@xmath5-nbse@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the best samples were made by oglesby _",
    "@xcite , which were large enough for inelastic neutron scattering studies of the vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "but in comparison with the other tmds , the most interesting facts about it are : ( 1 ) it has the highest @xmath4 value , 7.2 k , of any pristine tmd , ( 2 ) there is an incommensurate cdw below @xmath31 k which could consist of one or two components , in addition to a superconducting gap , and ( 3 ) there may be pseudogaps associated with these one or possibly two cdw components that extend very far above @xmath3 .",
    "direct evidence for the cdw coexisting in the superconducting state was presented by hess @xcite .",
    "the first magnetothermal oscillation evidence of the fermi surface changes due to the cdw was presented by graebner and robbins @xcite , and their proposed fermi surface distortion is shown in fig .",
    "possible arpes evidence for the two cdw gaps and their pseudogap features well above @xmath3 was first presented by borisenko",
    "_ et al._@xcite .",
    "this behavior is strikingly similar to the pseudogap behavior commonly seen in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "however , it should be remembered that no evidence for any magnetic ordering has been presented in any of the many studies of @xmath1-nbse@xmath2 , only a very small selection of which have been cited here .",
    "the superconductivity is not particularly anisotropic , as @xmath32 and @xmath33 are about 13.5 and 54 @xcite .",
    "in addition , application of hydroscopic pressure raises @xmath4 up to about 8.0 k @xcite , and it suppresses the cdws , as @xmath3 decreases linearly with increasing @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "uniaxial pressure along the @xmath10-axis decreases the resistivity anisotropy to a factor of 5 , and both @xmath35 and @xmath36 exhibit knees at about 30 kbar @xcite . @xmath37nb knight shift measurements on @xmath1-nbse@xmath2 were hampered by broad lines at low @xmath19@xcite , but @xmath38se knight shift measurements yielded @xmath39 consistent with the standard model of the electron spin susceptibility , indicating spin - singlet superconducting pairing in @xmath1-nbse@xmath2@xcite .",
    "more recently , the cdw state above @xmath4 was probed by @xmath37nb and @xmath38se knight shift measurements in @xmath1-nbse@xmath2@xcite .",
    "@xmath40 was strongly increasing for @xmath41@xcite , opposite to the usual yosida behavior .",
    "the amplitude of the cdw could be measured from the line width of the @xmath38se signal@xcite , and fit a bardeen , cooper , schrieffer ( bcs ) @xmath19 dependence .",
    "the first stm evidence of a star - shaped cdw pattern in superconducting 2@xmath5-nbse@xmath2 was presented by hess _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "although there have been many stm studies of 2@xmath5-nbse@xmath2 since then , a notable one by guillamn _",
    "_ observed the sc gap anisotropy from 0.6 to 1.4 mev .",
    "in addition , the conductance curves showeds locking of the sc order parameter onto the six - fold planar anisotropic cdw order parameter at 0.75 and 1.2 mv , as shown in fig .",
    "this is extremely unusual , and indicates the intricate interplay between these two orderings .",
    "hence , the sc order parameter is highly anisotropic , and it appears that this anisotropy may be directly related to the preexisting six - fold star - shaped cdw anisotropy , which competes for the same fermi surface with the sc order parameter .",
    "but the most direct evidence for an overall @xmath6-wave orbital symmetry of the superconducting order parameter was obtained by stm with a superconducting tip@xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "these authors succeeded in forming a josephson junction between the pb / ag stm tip and the nbse@xmath2 , but noted that the gap anisotropy they measured with a non - superconducting tip , from 0.7 to 1.4 mev , could not account for the low value of @xmath7 they obtained .",
    "this value was about 20% lower than that calculated from the minimum nbse@xmath2 gap , suggesting that the presence of the cdw could diminish the value from the anticipated ambegaokar - baratoff result for two isotropic superconductors in the absence of a cdw .",
    "those authors noted that this was similar to the results obtained in the cuprates.@xcite    [ fig8 ]    resistivity measurements on 4@xmath5(b)-tas@xmath2 @xcite , with alternating layers of octahedral and trigonal prismatic t@xmath17 configurations , were found to exhibit strong evidence for two non - superconducting transitions , with finite discontinuous drops in @xmath22 at 315 and 21 k , well above the superconducting transition at @xmath42 k @xcite . in six of eight samples studied , @xmath25 increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath19 , without any hint of anomalies at 315 and 22 k , until it drops suddenly to zero at @xmath4 . the similarity with the behavior seen in fig .",
    "2 for @xmath1-tas@xmath2 strongly suggests that these higher transitions are likely to be cdw transitions .",
    "under hydrostatic pressure , the 22 k cdw @xmath43 anomaly is suppressed by 8.5 kbar , the 315 k cdw @xmath43 anomaly is suppressed by 35 kbar , and @xmath4 increases to 4.35 k by 28 kbar . @xcite .",
    "de haas shubnikov oscillations indicated that the fermi surface of 4@xmath5(b)-tas@xmath2 is very 2d , or cylindrical @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of the upper critical field of @xmath44(b)-ta@xmath45nb@xmath46se@xmath2 is weak and nearly independent of temperature @xcite .",
    "the first example of intercalation of tmd s with organic molecules was made by weiss and ruthardt using 2@xmath5-tis@xmath2 and aliphatic amides @xcite . trying a similar reaction on a superconducting tmd , gamble _ et al . _",
    "( including this author ) found that by immersing crystalline @xmath1-tas@xmath2 in liquid pyridine at 200@xmath47 c , the tmd crystals grew visibly , and the nominal composition of the intercalated tmd was found to be tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 @xcite , with a @xmath16 that had increased upon intercalation to 3.5 k from 0.6 k in pristine @xmath1-tas@xmath2 .",
    "subsequently , it was found that a large class of lewis bases could intercalate into a variety of tmds @xcite .",
    "this class included octadecylamine , which when intercalated into tas@xmath2 , led to a @xmath10-axis repeat distance of 5.7 nm .",
    "however , @xmath16 did not change significantly upon the length of the carbon chain of aliphatic amine intercalants @xcite .",
    "intercalation of paramagnetic cobaltocene into both @xmath1-tas@xmath2 and snse@xmath2 led to superconducting compounds @xcite .",
    "nearly all organic or organometallic intercalation compounds of @xmath1-tas@xmath2 had onset @xmath16 values close to 3.5 k. the increase in @xmath16 upon intercalation of @xmath1-tas@xmath2 with lewis bases was found to be due to the suppression of the cdws by the intercalation process in that material @xcite .",
    "curiously , when @xmath1-nbs@xmath2 was intercalated with pyridine and other organic lewis bases , @xmath16 decreased from its pristine value of 5.8 - 6.3 k to 3 - 4 k , nearly the same as for the intercalation compounds of @xmath1-tas@xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath1-nbs@xmath2 does not give rise to cdw formation , but instead has different superconducting gaps on the two major fermi surfaces @xcite , one might suppose that one of these superconducting gaps might have been at least partially suppressed upon intercalation . however , there is to date no direct evidence of this .",
    "[ fig9 ]    since it was clear that such intercalation chemistry involved charge transfer from the intercalant to the host tmd , gamble _ et al . _ first imagined that a possible structure of tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 would involve the unpaired electrons on the nitrogen atoms in the pyridine molecules being located as close as possible to the host tas@xmath2 layers @xcite . in the case of tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 ,",
    "the charge of about one electron for two pyridine molecules was determined to be transferred @xcite , leading to the possible formation of bipyridyl within the intercalant layers @xcite .",
    "the charge transfer was found to be facilitated by the presence of water , which can produce pyridinium ( h@xmath2o)@xmath48 ions @xcite .",
    "intercalation of @xmath1-tas@xmath2 with pyridine was found to be much more complicated than originally imagined by the author and his co - workers .",
    "electron microscopy studies revealed screw dislocations in the host tas@xmath2 layers , due to the difficulty in making single - phase @xmath1-tas@xmath2 without annealing it from @xmath44(b)-tas@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these screw dislocations cause the @xmath1-tas@xmath2 layers to exfoliate upon intercalation .",
    "in addition , the original intercalation procedure led to a mixed composition of nominal tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 , with the different @xmath10-axis values @xmath49 and 1.193 nm , respectively @xcite . by dissolving excess sulfur in the pyridine , thompson found that the `` single phase '' intercalation compound with only @xmath49 nm and a greatly reduced tendency for exfoliation upon intercalation was obtained @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering , electron diffraction , and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies of nbs@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 and tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 indicated that the nitrogen atoms in the intercalant pyridine molecules were midway between the tmd layers , so that the planes of the pyridine molecules were perpendicular to the tas@xmath2 layers @xcite . the mixed phase @xmath50 nm material obtained by immersion the tmd in pure pyridine involved a horizontal shift of the tmd layers , so that the s atoms lay directly above one another after intercalation , which was not the case in the pristine @xmath51 polytype @xcite .",
    "second , parry _ et al . _ found that this procedure led to a pyridine superlattice that was commensurate with the tas@xmath2 lattice on both sides of each pyridine layer , with the superlattice cell dimensions of 13@xmath52 in terms of the @xmath53 hexagonal planar lattice constant of @xmath1-tas@xmath2 , and actual composition tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath54 @xcite .",
    "however , kashiwaya and yoshioka found that in addition to this superlattice , there was a second superlattice of cell dimensions @xmath55 and composition tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath56 , and the two superlattices of pyridine - intercalated tas@xmath2 formed from pure pyridine contained domains of both commensurate pyridine superlattices @xcite .",

    "this room temperature resistivity anisotropy of about @xmath68 for tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 is almost certainly limited by electrical shorts due to screw dislocations and exfoliations , so that the actual resistivity anisotropy is likely to be much larger than this .",
    "proton spin - lattice relaxation rates in tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 and in nbs@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 were measured @xcite .",

    "the schematic electronic structure of the pristine 1@xmath19-tise@xmath2 above and below the commensurate charge density wave transition @xmath122 was semiempirically determined by rossnagel , and are pictured in fig .",
    "the phase diagram of the intercalated cu@xmath14tise@xmath2 materials is shown in fig .",
    "15@xcite . in this work ,",
    "small amounts of cu as an intercalant suppress the cdw and the semi - metallic state in pristine tmd , allowing for superconductivity in ticu@xmath14se@xmath2 for @xmath123 , with a maximum @xmath124 k at @xmath125 .",
    "from the conventional specific heat peak and the measured @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 only differing by about a factor of 11 , the data suggest that ticu@xmath129se@xmath2 is a rather ordinary anisotropic type - ii superconductor @xcite .",
    "no measurements of critical field anisotropies were reported .",
    "this enhancement of superconductivity by transition metal intercalation is similar to the much earlier iron intercalation of @xmath1-tas@xmath2 , which raised @xmath16 from 0.6 k to about 3k in tafe@xmath130s@xmath2@xcite .",
    "although @xmath127 showed an anomalously large amount of upward curvature , the @xmath131 anisotropy @xmath132 was nearly the constant value of 35 .",
    "the upward curvature therefore observed in @xmath71 could not really be associated with dimensional crossover effects @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath1-tas@xmath2 was intercalated with cu , and tacu@xmath133s@xmath2 was produced and studied by nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "another class of tmd intercalation compounds is the hydrates with transition metal ions as intercalants into @xmath1-tas@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these compounds have the general composition @xmath117(h@xmath2o)@xmath134 , where @xmath19 can be either ta or nb , @xmath95 s , and @xmath88 can be an alkali or a rare earth ion . usually the compounds are made by electrolytic intercalation processes .",
    "the resulting compositions sometimes do not include water , or can involve alkali hydroxides in place of @xmath88 and h@xmath2o .",
    "typical @xmath16 values range from 2.1 to 5.6 k. few superconducting experiments were performed , other than to measure @xmath4 and possibly some @xmath131 data .",
    "no order parameter symmetry experiments were performed . however , since these are non - stoichiometric compounds , the @xmath10-axis tunneling through the ion - water layers is most likely incoherent .",
    "these compounds are very similar to the cobaltates such as na@xmath14coo@xmath15h@xmath2o , which also contain intercalant water layers with dissolved na ions and remarkably similar @xmath4 values and anisotropic normal state and superconducting properties@xcite .",
    "the transition metal dichalcogenides are very complicated materials , which mimic many of the features seen in the high-@xmath16 cuprates , pnictides , the organic layered superconductors , the cobaltates , and mgb@xmath2 .",
    "nearly all of them are complicated by one or more cdws , which can be either commensurate or incommensurate with the underlying lattice , can exhibit gap nodes ( although such nodes are rare ) , can possibly persist as pseudogaps well above the onset of long - range cdw order , and compete directly with the superconductivity for fermi surface gapping area below @xmath4 . with sufficiently strong applied pressure or by intercalation with a variety of organic or inorganic materials ,",
    "the cdws are suppressed , and the superconductivity either appears or is enhanced .",
    "@xmath1-nbs@xmath2 is the exception , as it does not exhibit any cdw formation , but instead has two , rather isotropic , superconducting gaps , presumably on different fermi surfaces . in this case",
    ", intercalation reduces @xmath16 , but hydrostatic pressure increases @xmath16 , which might be due to fermi surface pressure changes . scanning tunneling microscopy with and without a superconducting tip provided josephson junction evidence of a highly anisotropic @xmath6-wave superconducting order parameter in 2@xmath5-nbse@xmath2 , although the strength of the josephson coupling was weaker than expected , and attributed to possible interactions with the cdw .",
    "pristine @xmath1-nbse@xmath2 has a complicated star - shaped cdw gap structure that coexists with the superconductivity , and possible pseudogaps well above the onset of cdw order , as in some cuprate superconductors .",
    "the cdw in @xmath1-tas@xmath2 has a node on the fermi surface .",
    "both the intrinsic misfit compound ( lase)@xmath8(nbse@xmath2 ) and a number of organic intercalates of @xmath1-tas@xmath2 and @xmath1-nbs@xmath2 , are not only free of any cdws , but exhibit strong @xmath71 evidence for dimensional crossover from 3d to 2d behavior below @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , @xmath82 for ( lase)@xmath8(nbse@xmath2 ) appears to violate the ordinary pauli limit by the factor of 8.4 , which is very unconventional , especially since the gap @xmath135 fits the bcs curve for an isotropic @xmath6-wave superconductor accurately .",
    "as do the organic intercalates of @xmath1-tas@xmath2 and presumably those of @xmath1-nbs@xmath2 , ( lase)@xmath8(nbse@xmath2 ) has incoherent @xmath10-axis transport , and exhibits dimensional crossover at a temperature below which it behaves as a stack of intrinsic josephson junctions , precisely as do bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath11 and the organic layered superconductor @xmath12-(et)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br @xcite .",
    "thus , the transition metal dichalcogenides and their intercalates , while @xmath6-wave superconductors , contain many examples that are not at all conventional in their superconducting and normal state properties .    99 r.a .",

    "<S> transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) are quasi - two - dimensional layered compounds that exhibit strongly competing effects of charge - density wave ( cdw ) formation and superconductivity ( sc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the weak van der waals interlayer bonding between hexagonal layers of octahedral or trigonal prismatic tmd building blocks allows many polytypes to form . in the single layer </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 polytype materials , one or more cdw states can form , but the pristine tmds are not superconducting . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 polytypes have two or more fermi surfaces and saddle bands , allowing for dual orderings , which can be coexisting cdw and sc orderings , two sc gaps as in mgb@xmath2 , two cdw gaps , and possibly even pseudogaps above the onset @xmath3s of cdw orderings . </S>",
    "<S> higher order polytypes allow for multiple cdw gaps and at least one superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> the cdw transitions @xmath3s usually greatly exceed the superconducting transitions at their low @xmath4 values , their orbital order parameters ( ops ) are generally highly anisotropic and can even contain nodes , and the sc ops can be greatly affected by their simultaneous presence . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the cdws ubiquitously seen in tmds are remarkably similar to those of the pseudogaps seen in the high-@xmath4 cuprates . in 2@xmath5-nbse@xmath2 , for example , the cdw renders its general @xmath6-wave sc op orbital symmetry to be highly anisotropic and strongly reduces its josephson coupling strength ( @xmath7 ) with the conventional sc , pb . hence , the pristine tmds are highly `` unconventional '' in comparison with pb , but are much more `` conventional '' than are the ferromagnetic superconductors such as urhge . applied pressure and intercalation generally suppress the tmd cdws , allowing for enhanced sc formation , even in the @xmath0 polytype materials . the misfit intercalation compound ( lase)@xmath8(nbse@xmath2 ) and many @xmath1-tmds intercalated with organic lewis base molecules , such as tas@xmath2(pyridine)@xmath9 , </S>",
    "<S> have completely incoherent @xmath10-axis transport , dimensional - crossover effects , and behave as stacks of intrinsic josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> except for the anomalously large apparent violation of the pauli limit of the upper critical field of ( lase)@xmath8(nbse@xmath2 ) , these normal state and superconducting properties of these intercalation compounds are very similar to those seen in the high-@xmath4 superconductor , bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath11 and in the organic layered superconductor , @xmath12-(et)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br , where et is bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene . electrolytic intercalation of tmds with water and metallic ions leads to compounds with very similar properties to cobaltates such as na@xmath14coo@xmath15h@xmath2o . </S>"
