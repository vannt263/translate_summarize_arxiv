    "in the last decade , several methods have become available to prepare molecules in the gas phase at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "going beyond thermalization with a cold environment , these methods allow for a precise control of the external and internal degrees of freedom in molecular samples .",
    "cold molecules with translational temperatures in the range 100mk1k may then find applications in precision spectroscopy  @xcite and in the study of chemical reactivity at very low collision energies and very high energy resolution  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , they may also represent the starting point for further cooling steps toward the ultracold regime below 1mk  @xcite .",
    "the choice of the cooling method depends on the properties of the species of interest  @xcite . in the case of paramagnetic atoms and molecules which can be entrained in a supersonic beam ,",
    "multistage zeeman deceleration  @xcite and related techniques  @xcite are the methods of choice : the phase - space density of atoms and molecules in supersonic beams is high and is preserved by a phase - stable operation of the decelerator  @xcite , the method can be quantum - state selective  @xcite , the final velocity of the particles can be controlled and tuned over a wide range  @xcite , and the decelerated particles can be loaded into a magnetic trap  @xcite for observation of slow decay processes or spectroscopic measurements requiring long observation times .",
    "we describe here the use of multistage zeeman deceleration to generate slow and velocity - tunable beams of he@xmath9 molecules in the metastable @xmath10 state ( referred to as he@xmath11 hereafter ) in a setup tailored for future applications in precision spectroscopy .",
    "we also demonstrate the possibility to use the cold molecular samples to study the rovibrational energy - level structure of the @xmath10 state of he@xmath9 and the @xmath12 ground state of he@xmath5 by photoionization and photoelectron spectroscopic methods .",
    "being three- and four - electron systems , respectively , he@xmath9 and he@xmath5 represent attractive systems to test the accuracy of _ ab - initio _ quantum - chemical methods . in the two - electron systems h@xmath9 , hd , and d@xmath9 ,",
    "the results of _ ab - initio _ calculations of dissociation energies and rovibrational energy levels which include adiabatic and nonadiabatic corrections to the born - oppenheimer approximation as well as quantum - electrodynamics corrections up to the leading ( one - loop ) contribution to the term proportional to @xmath13 were found to be in agreement with experimental results within the combined uncertainties of the experimental and theoretical determinations  @xcite .",
    "such calculations become increasingly challenging as the number of electrons increases , and the magnitudes of the relativistic and quantum - electrodynamics corrections are not accurately known for he@xmath5 . in a recent high - resolution",
    "spectroscopic study of the threshold ionization spectrum of he@xmath11 , the level spacings between the lowest four rotational levels of he@xmath5 could be determined at an accuracy of 100mhz  @xcite .",
    "comparison with the latest _ ab - initio _ calculations neglecting quantum - electrodynamics corrections  @xcite did not reveal significant deviations from the experimental results at this level of accuracy , except perhaps for the highest rotational level observed experimentally . in future , we would like to improve the accuracy of these measurements by using a slow beam of metastable he@xmath9 , which motivated us to develop a he@xmath11 source better suited to precision spectroscopic experiments .    as a starting point ,",
    "a supersonic beam of @xmath14 was produced with a pulsed source operated at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "the velocity of the molecules was subsequently reduced to @xmath15100 m/s by coupling the cryogenic beam source to a multistage zeeman decelerator . from pulsed - field - ionization zero - kinetic - energy ( pfi - zeke ) photoelectron spectra of the @xmath16 transition",
    ", we have determined the internal - state distribution of the cold molecules in the beam and found rotational states up to @xmath2 to be populated .",
    "deceleration experiments with these molecules enabled the study of the rotational state selectivity of the deceleration process and a comparison with the deceleration of molecular oxygen ( @xmath17 ) in the @xmath18 state , for which full selectivity of the spin - rotational state @xmath19 was achieved  @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is formed in a gas of pure helium under conditions where the density allows for three - body collisions on the relevant time scales and collision partners of sufficiently high energy are available to excite helium atoms to their metastable states .",
    "such conditions typically prevail in plasmas , such as those generated by striking an electric discharge through helium gas  @xcite .",
    "the large ratio of magnetic moment to mass makes @xmath14 particularly attractive for multistage zeeman deceleration .",
    "moreover , the predicted radiative lifetime of 18s of @xmath14  @xcite is sufficiently long that no decay takes place on the millisecond timescale of the deceleration process .",
    "however , the high velocity ( about 2000 m/s ) of a supersonic expansion of pure he from a reservoir held at room temperature poses a problem . for the multistage zeeman decelerator used in our experiments , the deceleration - solenoid geometry and the 8@xmath20s switching times of the pulsed deceleration magnetic fields limit the maximal initial velocity of the particles to be decelerated to about 700 m/s  @xcite .",
    "the common approach to produce low - velocity supersonic beams consisting of seeding the species of interest in a heavy rare gas is not an option in the case of @xmath21 and @xmath14 because these metastable species carry sufficient internal energy to cause the penning ionization of all other rare gases  @xcite .",
    "the operation of the pulsed - valve assembly , including discharge electrodes , at cryogenic temperatures is therefore the only viable option to reduce the initial velocity of the supersonic beam to below 700 m/s .    to produce slow and velocity - tunable beams of metastable helium molecules at low speed",
    ", we have combined a pulsed cryogenic supersonic beam source with a multistage zeeman decelerator in the experimental setup depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ]  ( a ) .",
    "the setup consists of the pulsed - valve assembly with discharge electrodes , the actual multistage zeeman decelerator , and a detection region where the metastable molecules are photoionized with uv laser radiation and the ions or electrons are extracted in the direction perpendicular to the beam propagation axis toward a microchannel - plate ( mcp ) detector .",
    "the zeeman decelerator was described in detail in ref .",
    "consequently , only the beam source is presented in detail in the following description of the experimental setup and procedure .",
    "rotational ground state of @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the low - field - seeking states , for which the deceleration pulse sequence is optimized , are indicated in red . ]",
    "the pulsed supersonic beam is created by expanding helium gas into vacuum from a reservoir held at high stagnation pressure ( typically 26bar ) through the 250@xmath20m - diameter ceramic orifice of a modified even - lavie valve  @xcite . to efficiently cool the valve , its entire housing , originally made of stainless steel ,",
    "was replaced by copper components .",
    "the valve assembly is mounted onto the copper baseplate of a @xmath150.7l cylindrical container which can be filled with cryogenic liquids , either liquid nitrogen for operation at 77k , or liquid helium for operation down to 4k .",
    "the temperature of the valve assembly is monitored with a silicon diode ( lakeshore dt-670 ) directly attached to it . throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to the temperature measured with this sensor as the `` source temperature '' .",
    "starting with the valve assembly at room temperature , it takes about two hours until the valve and discharge operate stably at about 10k .",
    "once the desired final temperature is reached , the nozzle - assembly temperature is actively stabilized with a resistive heater attached to the valve . with feedback from a closed - loop proportional - integral - derivative ( pid )",
    "controller ( lakeshore 336 ) , the source temperature fluctuates by less than 0.1k and conditions remain stable for several hours .",
    "the metastable helium molecules are generated by striking a discharge and forming a plasma in the expansion region .",
    "for this purpose , the expanding gas passes through a 10mm - long , 1.6mm - diameter channel defined by two cylindrical electrodes directly attached to the front plate of the valve and separated by an electrically insulating sapphire spacer ( 2 mm length , inner diameter of cylindrical channel 2 mm ) .",
    "the discharge is ignited by applying a typically 5@xmath20s long , @xmath24v pulse to the front electrode as soon as the density of the helium beam in the channel is sufficiently high . in the discharge ,",
    "the metastable @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 states of atomic helium are populated , and the metastable helium dimer molecules are formed . to facilitate ignition of the discharge during the short duration of the gas pulse ( typically a few tens of microseconds ) , the discharge is seeded with electrons emitted from a hot tungsten filament  @xcite and attracted toward the channel by a @xmath28v bias on the front electrode . without the filament , ignition of the discharge required much higher electric tensions , which unnecessarily heated the beam .",
    "the discharge and nozzle operation parameters ( electric tension , timing , stagnation pressure ) were optimized by monitoring the yield of @xmath14 with the methods described in section  [ sec : setup : detection ] .",
    "we have also tested other discharge - electrode designs ( e.g. , high electric tension applied to a sharp tip in the expansion region  @xcite , cylindrical electrodes surrounding a glass capillary ) and found the best yield of @xmath14 with the channel described above .",
    "all discharge configurations produced beams of metastable helium atoms , but @xmath29 was only observed in the configuration described above .    in the experiment",
    ", we observed a strong influence of the discharge electrode temperature on the final velocity of the beam of metastable helium atoms and molecules .",
    "this observation may be explained by the discharge electrodes being part of the channel through which the gas expands , thus constituting a virtual gas reservoir for the expansion and beam - formation process . to cool this critical part of the setup to the lowest possible temperatures ,",
    "the discharge assembly was mechanically connected and thermally linked to the copper front plate of the valve body . moreover ,",
    "the valve and discharge assembly were surrounded by a thermal shield cooled with liquid nitrogen , which served the purpose of minimizing the heat load of thermal radiation from the hot filament and from components of the vacuum chamber at room temperature .    for fast data acquisition in spectroscopic experiments",
    ", the source can be operated at the full repetition rate of 25hz of the nd : yag - pumped dye - laser system used to detect the metastable molecules . in this case , a 650l / s ( nominal pumping speed for he ) turbo molecular pump sufficed to maintain the pressure in the source vacuum chamber in the @xmath30 mbar range .",
    "after the formation of he@xmath11 molecules , the supersonic beam passed through the 2mm - diameter hole of a skimmer , which separates the source chamber from the multistage zeeman decelerator or the photoelectron spectrometer used to characterize the beam properties and guarantees efficient differential pumping .",
    "the multistage zeeman decelerator used in the present work consists of an array of deceleration solenoids to which current pulses are applied and was described in ref .",
    "the deceleration results from the force @xmath31 that acts on a paramagnetic atom or molecule with magnetic moment @xmath32 and zeeman energy shift @xmath33 in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath34 .",
    "particle - trajectory simulations indicated that 55 deceleration stages operated at a current of 300a suffice to fully decelerate a beam of @xmath14 with an initial velocity of about 500 m/s .",
    "the 55 solenoids ( length 7.2 mm , 64 windings in four layers , 7.0 mm inner diameter ) used as deceleration stages were grouped in two modules of each twelve stages and one module of 31 stages .",
    "these modules were separated by pumping towers , as depicted in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the zeeman effect in the lowest rotational level @xmath35 of the metastable @xmath10 state of he@xmath9 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ]  ( b ) , where the low - field - seeking magnetic sublevels ( @xmath36 , drawn in red ) suitable for deceleration experiments have a magnetic moment corresponding to two bohr magnetons .",
    "because the spin - rotation coupling constant of low vibrational levels of the @xmath10 state of he@xmath9 is very small  @xcite , the zeeman effect in higher rotational levels follows the same pattern as in the @xmath37 level ( see also discussion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) . to generate beams of he@xmath11 with velocities in the range 100150 m/s ,",
    "the decelerator was operated at a repetition rate of 8.3hz by applying 250a current pulses to the deceleration solenoids , resulting in maximal magnetic fields on the decelerator axis of about 1.8 t and zeeman shifts of about 1.6@xmath38 for the low - field - seeking magnetic sublevels .",
    "the pulse sequences were precalculated to reach the desired final velocities for molecules in these sublevels .",
    "optimal conditions were obtained for phase angles between 35@xmath39 and 45@xmath39 , as in our previous deceleration experiments with deuterium atoms  @xcite , metastable ne  @xcite , and o@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the electric discharge described in section  [ sec : setup : cryo ] leads to the production of metastable he atoms in the @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 states and of metastable @xmath0 molecules in the @xmath10 state .",
    "because both atoms and molecules are entrained at the same velocity in the supersonic expansion , they can not be distinguished on the basis of their times of flight to a detector placed along the propagation axis of the supersonic beam . to observe the atoms and the molecules",
    "separately , they were photoionized with uv laser radiation produced by second - harmonic generation of a nd : yag - pumped pulsed dye laser and the photoions were extracted through a field - free time - of - flight tube toward a microchannel - plate detector using an electric - field pulse in the range 10002000v / cm . the uv wave number ( 34467@xmath40 )",
    "was chosen to be above the ionization threshold of the metastable @xmath10 state of he@xmath9 , in a region free of autoionization resonances , and also above that of the metastable ( 1s)(2s ) @xmath41 state of he .",

    "high - resolution photoelectron spectra of @xmath29 were recorded using the technique of pfi - zeke photoelectron spectroscopy  @xcite following the same procedure as in our earlier study of the he@xmath45 photoionizing transition  @xcite .",
    "the internal state distribution of the metastable molecules was deduced from the rotational structure of the photoelectron spectra and the analysis of the rydberg series observed in the photoionization spectra , as explained in section  [ sec : results : source ] .",
    "the flight times of the metastable molecules from the point where they were generated in the discharge to the point where they were photoionized by the uv laser ( called `` neutral - tof spectra '' hereafter ) were obtained by monitoring the resulting @xmath44 signal as a function of the delay time between the ignition of the discharge and the photoionization laser pulse . from the measured tof distributions , the velocity distribution of the metastable molecule in the beam can be determined .",

    "the higher signal - to - noise ratio obtained at a nozzle - assembly temperature of 10k indicates that the density of he@xmath11 is almost an order of magnitude larger than when the nozzle assembly is operated at room temperature .",
    "whereas the rotational - line - intensity distribution of the spectrum recorded following expansion from the 300k nozzle is well described by a rotational temperature of about 150k , the spectrum of the @xmath29 sample obtained with the 10k nozzle assembly is characterized by a bimodal rotational intensity distribution , with a cold component corresponding to a temperature of about 150k for levels with @xmath59 and a much hotter ( nonthermal ) component corresponding to rotational levels in the range",

    "when the nozzle assembly and the discharge electrodes are cooled down to about 10k , the he@xmath11 molecules are entrained in a supersonic beam with a mean velocity of @xmath63 m/s , which is well below the maximal initial velocity tolerated by our zeeman decelerator .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : setup : zeeman ] , 55 deceleration stages grouped in three modules suffice to decelerate he@xmath11 to final velocities of 100 m/s .",

    "the neutral - tof distributions presented in fig .  [ fig : decel ] demonstrate the possibility to tune the final velocity of the decelerated beam in the range between 100 and 150 m/s .",
    "although the present setup allows for the deceleration to lower final velocities in a straightforward way , either by operating the decelerator at a larger phase angle or by applying larger deceleration magnetic fields , the detection of these slow molecules becomes increasingly difficult .",
    "in particular , the rather large distance of 60 mm between the last solenoid of the decelerator and the detection volume inevitably reduces the particle density by transverse defocussing and longitudinal dispersion effects , which play a larger role at lower final velocities  @xcite . for the efficient generation of beams with velocities below 100 m/s , deceleration pulse sequences with optimized phase angles , such as those already used for trap - loading schemes  @xcite , might be useful to focus and bunch the molecules into the detection region .          the maximum intensity of the peak in fig .

    "unfortunately , it was not possible to record pfi - zeke photoelectron spectra in the region beyond the last coil of the decelerator .",
    "indeed , the detection of the photoelectrons following extraction in the direction parallel to the beam propagation axis was hindered by the background signal originating from metastable atoms and molecules and electrons generated by the discharge . the stray magnetic fields along the decelerator axis further prevented the detection of electrons extracted in the direction perpendicular to the beam propagation axis .",
    "the internal - state distribution of the decelerated sample had therefore to be determined from the photoionization spectrum of @xmath29 , which is dominated by contributions from autoionization resonances in the vicinity of the ionization thresholds ( see fig .",

    "the low translational temperature of the decelerated sample ( less than 100mk ) and the broad range of populated rotational levels ( @xmath8 ranging from 1 to 21 ) makes this source ideally suited to measurements of the rydberg spectrum of @xmath0 , of the ionization energy of @xmath29 and of the rovibrational structure of @xmath44 by high - resolution photoionization and photoelectron spectroscopic methods .",
    "unexpectedly , the population of metastable molecules in the supersonic expansion were found to be distributed over many more rotational levels when the valve was cooled down to low temperature than when it was operated at room temperature .",
    "we interpret this observation as arising from the fact that the rotational spacings in @xmath29 are much larger than the thermal collision energy when the nozzle assembly is held at low temperature , which effectively hinders rotational cooling .",
    "the broad range of rotational levels in the supersonic expansion enabled us to study how the zeeman deceleration process affects the rotational - state distribution .",
    "in contrast to o@xmath9 , for which multistage zeeman deceleration led to the formation of slow beams of molecules in a single magnetic sublevel of a single spin - rotational level of the ground electronic state  @xcite , we did not observe any rotational state selectivity in the multistage zeeman deceleration of @xmath29 .",
    "the reason for the very different behaviors observed in o@xmath9 and @xmath29 lies in the different nature of the zeeman effect in these two molecules , which itself results from the fact that @xmath29 has a much larger rotational constant than o@xmath9 ( @xmath62  @xcite vs. @xmath79  @xcite ) and spin - rotational splittings more than two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the zeeman effect in the ground vibrational level of @xmath74 @xmath18 and @xmath0 @xmath10 are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeemancomparison ] . in @xmath74 ,",
    "the paschen - back regime is not reached at the magnetic fields up to 2 t used in our experiments because of the large fine - structure splitting of the rotational levels .",
    "moreover , interactions between magnetic sublevels of the same @xmath80 values but belonging to different rotational levels cause strong nonlinearities and avoided crossings already below 5 t . in @xmath29 ,",
    "the paschen - back regime is already reached at fields of less than 0.1 t , and the large rotational spacings prevent any avoided crossings even at fields in excess of 15 t .",
    "consequently the low - field - seeking magnetic sublevels of the different rotational levels of @xmath29 are subject to almost identical zeeman shifts at the fields used in our deceleration experiments , which makes the deceleration process completely insensitive to the degree of rotational excitation .",
    "consideration of the zeeman effect in the rotational levels of the @xmath10 of @xmath0 , however , reveals that none of the magnetic sublevels of the spin - rotational levels with @xmath6 are low - field seeking ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zeemancomparison ]  ( d ) ) .",
    "multistage zeeman deceleration of @xmath29 therefore acts as a filter which selects the two spin - rotational components with @xmath81 and rejects the third .",
    "this property will represent an advantage in studies of the very congested rydberg spectrum of @xmath0 .",

    "<S> @xmath0 molecules in the metastable @xmath1 state have been generated by striking a discharge in a supersonic expansion of helium gas from a pulsed valve . when operating the pulsed valve at room temperature , 77k , and 10k , the mean velocity of the supersonic beam was measured to be 1900 m/s , 980 m/s , and 530 m/s , with longitudinal velocity distributions corresponding to temperatures of 4k , 1.9k , and 1.8k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the characterization of the population distribution among the different rotational levels of the @xmath1 state by high - resolution photoelectron and photoionization spectroscopy indicated a rotational temperature of about 150k for the beam formed by expansion from the room - temperature valve and a bimodal distribution for the beam produced with the valve held at 10k , with rotational levels up to @xmath2 being populated . </S>",
    "<S> a 55-stage zeeman decelerator operated in a phase - stable manner in the longitudinal and transverse dimensions was used to further reduce the beam velocity and tune it in the range between 100 and 150 m / s . </S>",
    "<S> the internal - state distribution of the decelerated sample was determined by recording and analyzing the photoionization spectrum in the region of the lowest ionization threshold , where it is dominated by resonances corresponding to autoionizing @xmath3p rydberg states belonging to series converging to the different rotational levels of the @xmath4 ground state of he@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the deceleration process did not reveal any rotational state selectivity , but eliminated molecules in spin - rotational sublevels with @xmath6 from the beam , @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the total and the rotational angular momentum quantum number , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of rotational state selectivity is attributed to the fact that the paschen - back regime of the zeeman effect in the rotational levels of the @xmath1 state of @xmath0 is already reached at fields of only 0.1 t . </S>"
