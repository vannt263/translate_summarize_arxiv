    "observations of metallicity evolution in galaxies provide important constraints on the histories of gas consumption and star formation , because the global densities of gas , metals , and stars are closely coupled .",
    "most cosmic chemical evolution models ( e.g. , pei & fall , 1995 ; malaney & chaboyer 1996 ; pei , fall , & hauser 1999 ; tissera et al . 2001 ; somerville , primack & faber 2001 ) predict that the global mean interstellar metallicity in galaxies rises from nearly zero at high redshifts to nearly solar at @xmath3 .",
    "the present - day mass - weighted mean metallicity of local galaxies is also nearly solar ( see , e.g. , kulkarni & fall 2002 ) .",
    "it is of great importance to determine whether the global mean metallicities of galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts agree with predictions of the cosmic chemical evolution models .",
    "there is a long history of using damped lyman - alpha absorbers ( dlas ) to measure the gas phase abundances over the age of the universe .",
    "it has been believed that dlas constitute most of the neutral gas in the galaxies at high redshifts , enough to form all stars visible today ( wolfe et al .",
    "furthermore , dlas were also believed to provide an unbiased sample of normal galaxies as they are selected only through the presence of large amounts of neutral hydrogen .",
    "recent data have raised questions regarding the validity of both these assumptions ( boisse et al .",
    "1998 ; rao & turnshek , 2000 ; kulkarni et al . 2001 ; rao et al . , 2003 ) . presence of dust and gravitational lensing can also affect the dla statistics ( fall & pei , 1993 ; bartelman & loeb , 1996 ) .",
    "however , dlas are still the primary source of information about the chemical abundances in galaxies over @xmath4 of the age of the universe .",
    "a large number of elements have been observed in dlas . in particular ,",
    "fe , zn , si , s and o have been used as probes of the metallicity in these systems .",
    "we prefer to use zn to determine the total ( gas + solid phase ) metallicity in dlas .",
    "this is because ( i ) zn tracks fe in most galactic stars ( e.g. , mishenina et al .",
    "2002 ) ; ( ii ) it is relatively undepleted on interstellar dust grains ; and ( iii ) the lines of the dominant ionization species zn  ii are most often unsaturated .",
    "abundances of depleted elements such as cr , fe or ni relative to zn probe the dust content of the absorbers ( e.g. , pettini et al . 1997 ; kulkarni , fall , & truran 1997 ) .",
    "dlas are thus useful for testing predictions of cosmic chemical evolution models and are expected to show a rise in the global mean metallicity with decreasing redshift , if they indeed trace an unbiased sample of galaxies selected only by @xmath5 . however , it is unclear whether or not dlas actually show such a trend .",
    "there has been great debate about this issue , with most studies advocating no evolution in the global mean metallicity ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; prochaska & wolfe 1999 ; vladilo et al .",
    "2000 ; prochaska & wolfe 2000 ; savaglio 2001 ; prochaska 2001 ; prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) . in a reexamination of this issue for 57 zn measurements in the range @xmath6 , kulkarni & fall ( 2002 ) found",
    "that the slope of the metallicity - redshift relation is @xmath7 , consistent at @xmath82 - 3@xmath9 level with model predictions ( @xmath100.25 to @xmath100.61 , pei & fall , 1995 ; malaney & chaboyer , 1996 ; somerville et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as with no evolution . a similar slope ( -0.25@xmath11 ) was also found more recently by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "one reason for the ambiguity in the metallicity - redshift relation is the large intrinsic scatter in the data .",
    "it is important to determine if the scatter apparent in the existing samples is cosmic scatter or is caused by errors of interpretation of the data .",
    "it is also important to observationally investigate whether dla samples are being affected by dust obscuration .",
    "we address both these issues in this paper .",
    "the other reason for the lack of accurate metallicity - redshift relation is the small number of measurements available , especially at @xmath12 .",
    "most previous dla zn studies have focused on @xmath13 because the zn ii @xmath14 2026 , 2062 lines lie in the ultraviolet ( uv ) for @xmath15 , and likewise for lyman-@xmath16 for @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the zn ii lines can be accessed with ground - based telescopes , but lie in blue wavelengths where many spectrographs have lower sensitivity .",
    "it is very important to obtain more data at @xmath12 , because this regime spans @xmath19 of the age of the universe ( for @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the mean comoving matter density and vacuum energy density of the universe , respectively , in units of the critical energy density of the universe ) .",
    "the low-@xmath24 data provide great leverage on the slope of the metallicity - redshift relation , and can clarify the relation of dlas to present - day galaxies .",
    "a lack of metallicity evolution would contradict the high global star formation rate at @xmath25 inferred from the galaxy surveys such as the canada france redshift survey , hubble deep field , as well as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( e.g. lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ; glazebrook et al . 2003 ) .",
    "it would imply that either dlas systematically trace only metal - poor dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies , or that the more metal - rich and dustier dlas obscure their background quasars . clearly , it is necessary to pin down the shape of the metallicity evolution in a more definitive way .    as a first step toward improving the statistics of the metallicity - redshift relation at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "we have recently started a survey of element abundances for dlas or strong dla candidates ( hereafter , cdlas ) at @xmath12 discovered with the sdss or the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . here",
    "we report the results of this survey for a sample of 11 dlas with @xmath26 .",
    "our observations and data reduction are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 explains the determination of column densities .",
    "notes on individual objects are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 describes our results .",
    "finally , a discussion of our results and implications for the redshift evolution of dust content and metallicity are presented in section 6 .",
    "our sample consists of quasar absorbers at @xmath26 , for which either a damped lyman-@xmath16 line is observed in hst spectra , or a strong dla is expected on the basis of mg ii or fe ii lines ( rao & turnshek , 2000 ) available in the sdss early data release ( edr ) spectra ( schneider et al . 2002 ; york et al .",
    "in particular , we have chosen systems that have @xmath27  and some other indicator of high @xmath5 ( fe i , c i , mg i , mn ii , ni ii , ca ii , cr ii , zn ii or si ii @xmath28 ) . for six of these sdss systems @xmath29  . in the case of the @xmath30 system in sdss1727",

    "a 1.0@xmath35 wide slit was used . in order to achieve the required s / n while avoiding cosmic rays , we took several exposures of each object of durations 1800 s or 2700 s depending on their magnitudes .",
    "each exposure was preceded and followed by he+ne+ar lamp exposures as well as quartz lamp flat field exposures to get accurate wavelength calibration and flat fielding .",
    "biases , additional quartz flats , and spectra of bright stars were taken in the beginning and end of each night .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard spectrographic reduction packages of iraf .",
    "instrumental resolution was obtained from gaussian fits to the lamp lines near the wavelengths of all lines to be analyzed in the object spectra .",

    "the continuum - fitted spectra with line identifications for the confirmed dlas and cdlas are given in figs .",

    "table 4 lists the rest - frame equivalent widths , with 1 @xmath36 errors , of the various heavy element lines measured for each system . for lines which are blended with stronger lines of other systems , we give the equivalent width of the blend as an upper limit . for weaker ( below the 3 @xmath36 detection limit ) lines of those species",
    "for which the stronger lines have been observed , we give the 3 @xmath36 upper limit on the equivalent width , obtained assuming the line to be three pixel wide .",

    "this @xmath37 is given in units of 10@xmath38 , so , for instance an entry of 5 at z of 1 corresponds to 7.5 km s@xmath39 or 0.1  at 4000  , about 1/4 of a pixel width ( 832 l / mm grating , 2@xmath40 order ) or 1/5 of a pixel width ( 1200 l / mm grating 1@xmath41 order ) .",
    "the reasonably high values of s / n for our data made it possible to perform profile fitting analysis using the package fits6p ( welty et al .",

    "the lines of zn ii and cr ii are often strong , stronger than those detected in some other studies . for instance , our average rest frame equivalent widths of the blend of zn ii and mg i lines at 2026  and of cr ii line at 2056  are 182 m and 152 m respectively , while those of pettini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) are 92 m for both lines",
    ". this may be partly due to the fact that in order to ensure the dla nature of the absorbers , we have chosen systems from the sdss spectra that have strong mg ii and fe ii lines and some other indicator of high n@xmath42 ( c i , mg i , si ii @xmath28 , mn ii , ni ii , ca ii , cr ii , or zn ii ) .",
    "we thus could have chosen dlas at the high column density end ( which after all dominate the n@xmath43-weighted global mean metallicity ) . however , in principle , it is also possible that , due to chemical evolution , the abundances at lower redshift are higher than the abundances at the redshifts ( @xmath44 2 ) observed , e.g. , by pettini et al .",

    "therefore , in determining the column densities of zn ii and cr ii , we have used information about other lines of mg i , wherever necessary , and of cr ii . for mg",

    "it is possible that the mg i column density as obtained from the @xmath33 2853 line may be affected by saturation effects , however , no other line of mg i is detected .",

    "the general method followed for the analysis of the zn ii , cr ii , mg i lines between 2025  and 2070  was as follows .",

    "\\4 . sometimes , when it was not possible to fit the cr ii @xmath33 2056 line because of noise or a blend , and so it was not possible to determine the @xmath46 value , we took the @xmath46 value for the zn ii , cr ii and mg i lines to be the same as that for si ii or for fe ii . in principle the effective @xmath46 value for",

    "the 1 @xmath36 uncertainties in the parameters were computed simultaneously . in cases",
    "where the effective @xmath46 values were assumed to be the same as those of fe ii or si ii lines , we determined the uncertainties in column densities , due to the uncertainty in @xmath46 , by varying the effective @xmath46 value by @xmath48 as obtained for the fe ii or si ii lines used .",
    "we also investigated the effect of relaxing the constraints of same @xmath46 value and same central velocity for lines of different ions i.e. zn ii , cr ii and mg i and also , the effect of varying the mg i column density ( whenever it was taken from the sdss data ) to within its 1 @xmath36 range .",

    ", we used the observed @xmath112 colors of the quasars and calculated the excess @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the median @xmath112 color for the sdss quasar composite at the redshift of the quasar , taken from table 3 of richards et al .",
    "we then use the smc reddening law , a@xmath119 ( prevot et al .",
    "1984 ) to obtain the @xmath120 from the observed @xmath121 values .",
    "taking @xmath122 and @xmath123 to be 4657.98  and 7461.01  respectively , this gives @xmath124 , z being the redshift of the absorber . to obtain the @xmath114 for individual dlas toward sdssj1727 + 5302 we assumed them to be in proportion to the h i column densities in these systems .",
    "the @xmath120 values are given in table 7 .",
    "it is not clear whether the reddening in any of our targets ( estimated by either of the above methods ) is caused by dust intrinsic to the quasar or dust in the intervening absorbers .",
    "indeed , the 2200  bump has been observed in a few quasar spectra at the redshifts of the quasar and/or the intervening absorbers ( wang et al .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using sdss data , have shown the reddening to be dominated by smc type dust at the qso redshifts . in any case , the observed @xmath116 or @xmath120 values can be used to constrain the amounts of reddening that could be caused by the intervening dlas . from these , assuming the @xmath114 to be caused by the dla absorber and assuming it to be equal to n@xmath125 ( ignoring possible presence of h@xmath53 ) one can either obtain the h i column densities in the absorbers assuming a value of the constant @xmath126 for a specific extinction curve , or obtain the value of @xmath126 if n@xmath127 is known .",
    "these column densities , together with the observed zn ii column densities , can then be used to constrain the metallicities for the dlas for which n@xmath127 is not yet known .",
    "table 8 lists the n@xmath128 values inferred from hst spectra ( where available ) , along with estimates of n@xmath128 from the reddening @xmath120 , assuming d = 4.6@xmath129 @xmath65 mag@xmath39 for the smc extinction curve .",
    "the table also includes the corresponding values / estimates of the abundances of zn and ti .",
    "we note , however , that the h i column densities obtained from the @xmath114 values for sdss1107 + 0048 and sdss1323 - 0021 differ considerably from their hst values .",
    "the h i column densities obtained from the @xmath114 can , therefore , only be taken to be tentative values .",
    "we , thus , do not include the metallicity obtained in this manner for sdssj2340 - 0053 in our calculations for metallicity evolution , presented in the next subsection . using the hst values of h i column densities",
    "we get the values for d of 2.0@xmath129 , 1.0@xmath130 and 1.1@xmath131 for the dlas in sdss1107 + 0048 , sdss1323 - 0021 and sdss",
    "1727 + 5302 respectively .",
    "11 plots the two estimates of reddening for the sdss quasars in our sample vs. the [ cr / zn ] in the corresponding dlas .",
    "the circles show the @xmath116 values while the squares show the @xmath120 values .",
    "the filled symbols are for quasars with single dlas , while the unfilled symbols are for a quasar ( sdssj1727 + 5302 ) with two dlas along the line of sight , treated as described above to estimate the individual contributions of the two systems . there may be some anti - correlation between [ cr / zn ] and the reddening , such as may be expected if the reddening arises primarily in the absorbers , and the absorbers with the higher depletion of cr are also the ones with the greater reddening , and vice versa .",
    "the correlation is less clear if the double sight line is included , but the reddening estimates for such absorbers are less certain because of the assumption of the same extinction law for both systems in the sight line . clearly , it is necessary to obtain element depletions in many more sdss sight lines and to employ more robust estimators of the reddening to determine whether the correlation possibly present in fig .",
    "11 is truly significant .",
    "finally , we study the implications of our mmt data for the metallicity evolution of dlas .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on the methodology outlined in kulkarni & fall ( 2002 ) and uses the data compiled therein along with the more recent data referred to in section 5.2 as well as the data presented in this paper .",
    "we binned the combined sample in redshift and calculated the global n@xmath132-weighted metallicity in each bin .",
    "the last two columns of table 8 give the estimated abundances of zn and ti . in most systems",
    "the abundances of zn and ti are smaller than a tenth of the corresponding solar abundances except in the case of sdss1323 - 0021 , for which the zn abundance has a very high value .    for the sample of 41 dlas mentioned above ( section 5.2 ) , the @xmath133-weighted mean metallicity in the @xmath134 range is @xmath135 , and the linear regression slope of the metallicity - redshift relation is @xmath136 for the redshift range 0.7 @xmath137 3.4 . considering only zn measurements , irrespective of whether or not cr was measured ,",
    "a total of 83 dlas ( 51 detections , 32 limits ) are currently available from our mmt data and data from the literature .",
    "we constructed two samples for these 83 dlas : a `` maximum limits '' sample where the zn limits are treated as detections , and a `` minimum limits '' sample , where the zn limits are treated as zeros .",
    "for an individual system these extreme cases cover the full range of possible values the zn column densities can take in the case of the limits .",
    "the @xmath138-weighted mean metallicity in the redshift range @xmath139 is @xmath140 for both the `` maximum limits '' sample and the `` minimum limits '' samples .",
    "the linear regression slope of the metallicity - redshift relation for the redshift range @xmath141 is @xmath142 for the `` maximum limits '' sample , and @xmath143 for the `` minimum limits '' sample .",
    "the corresponding estimates for the intercept of the metallicity - redshift relation are @xmath144 for the `` maximum limits '' sample and @xmath145 for the `` minimum limits '' sample .    thus our data seem to indicate that there is no strong evolution of the global metallicity with redshift .",
    "we note that we have only one value at @xmath1460.6 in our data set .",
    "measurements at lower redshifts are important for better determination of the global metallicity evolution .",
    "kulkarni et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have taken steps in this direction by obtaining hst data at @xmath147 .",
    "the issues of dust depletion and associated selection effects , and the evolution of metallicity in dlas are not yet fully understood .",
    "the large samples of dlas or cdlas becoming available from the sdss can be used to improve the statistics of both element abundances and dust reddening . in this paper , we have presented results for 7 cdlas discovered in the sdss and have doubled the zn and cr samples at @xmath148 .",
    "our data suggest weak evolution of1 metallicity and dust content in the absorbers with redshift .",
    "kulkarni & fall ( 2002 ) , using 57 zn measurements in the redshift range @xmath6 , found the slope of the @xmath138-weighted mean metallicity - redshift relation to be @xmath7 .",
    "a very similar value of the slope was also obtained by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2003b ) using metallicity estimates for 121 dlas with @xmath149 .",
    "ten of these are based on zn , six on fe ( corrected by adding an assumed level of dust depletion ) , one on the x - ray absorption , and the remaining on si , s , or o. the estimates of the metallicity - redshift relation presented in our study are also consistent with both of these results .",
    "we note that we have used only zn as a tracer of metallicity for several reasons : ( a ) this avoids complications ( present in the case of si , s , or o ) of significant nucleosynthetic differences from the common metallicity indicator fe .",
    "( b ) zn allows direct metallicity estimates nearly free from dust depletion corrections which can be significant for fe .",
    "( c ) the use of one element also makes the study of metallicity evolution more uniform .",
    "nevertheless , it is very interesting that results based on zn alone agree with those based on other elements .",
    "we also note that out of the 121 dlas in the sample of prochaska et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , only 9 have @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the metallicity estimate for the lowest redshift system in that sample ( @xmath150 ) is based on x - ray absorption measurement of junkkarinen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , not on zn , and there could be systematic differences between metallicity estimates based on zn and those based on x - ray absorption .",
    "thus , our mmt measurements at @xmath151 are a significant addition to the existing abundance data at intermediate redshifts .    in a recent study , nestor et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have averaged sdss spectra at the positions of the zn ii and cr ii lines , all deredshifted to the rest frame of the absorber , as found from the mg ii lines .",
    "they found [ cr / zn]= -0.44@xmath152 at redshifts averaged from 0.9 to 2.2 .",
    "these values are similar to the values in the literature , summarized above , and also with our values obtained from the analysis of individual spectra of sdss objects . however , the variation of the ratio [ cr / zn ] from system to system is large , as we confirm here for @xmath1531.5 , and as has been observed for @xmath154 .",
    "it is important to determine if this variation is caused by a variation in the dust - to - gas ratio and if that correlates with variation in the extinction .",
    "overall , our observations have demonstrated the potential of the sdss , combined with higher resolution follow - up spectra , to study the chemical evolution of the dlas .",
    "further studies of a large number of sdss dlas at @xmath12 will help to determine the low-@xmath24 end of the cosmic metallicity - redshift relation to a much higher accuracy than before .",
    "such studies will help to understand whether or not dla observations agree with predictions of cosmic chemical evolution models , and whether dust extinction effects are significant .",
