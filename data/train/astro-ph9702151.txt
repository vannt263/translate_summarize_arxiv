    "active galaxies and quasars are thought to be powered by the presence of massive black holes ( bhs ) in their nuclei ( e.g. , rees 1997 ) .",
    "such bhs are believed to exist in a large fraction of quiescent galaxies as well ( e.g. , tremaine 1996 ) .",
    "the best dynamical bh detections in active galaxies come from studies of gas kinematics ; in quiescent galaxies only stars are generally available as a tracer of the gravitational potential .",
    "ground - based stellar kinematical studies have yielded tentative detections for bhs in a handful of nearby quiescent galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) , and this evidence is now being improved with the superior spatial resolution of the hubble space telescope ( hst ; kormendy 1996a , b ; van der marel 1997a ) .",
    "however , the interpretation of the observed stellar motions is never straightforward ; only projected quantities are observed and the three - dimensional orbital structure is unknown .",
    "construction of detailed dynamical models is therefore required .",
    "axisymmetric models currently provide the state - of - the - art for this application . in such models ,",
    "the phase - space distribution function ( df ) generally depends on three integrals of motion ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) , the two classical integrals , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( the binding energy and the angular momentum component along the symmetry axis , both per unit mass ) , and the third integral , @xmath12 .",
    "the latter can not generally be expressed analytically in terms of the phase - space coordinates , which makes the construction of models with ` three - integral ' dfs , @xmath13 , complicated and time - consuming , although not impossible ( dehnen & gerhard 1993 ; cretton 1997 ; gebhardt 1997 ) . as a result",
    ", significant attention has been given in recent years to a special class of axisymmetric models , those in which the df depends only on the two classical integrals of motion , @xmath1 .",
    "the attraction of these ` two - integral ' models lies in the fact that their properties are tractable semi - analytically ( e.g. , hunter & qian 1993 ; dehnen & gerhard 1994 ) .",
    "these models can be viewed as the axisymmetric generalization of spherical isotropic models : the velocity dispersions in the meridional plane are isotropic , i.e. , @xmath14 , and the flattening of the models ( when oblate ) is due to an excess of azimuthal motion .    the present paper deals with the nearby e3 galaxy m32 , which has been a strong candidate for containing a bh for many years .",
    "the highest spatial resolution ground - based data are well fit by an @xmath7 model with a 2@xmath15 bh ( van der marel 1994 ; qian 1995 ; dehnen 1995 ; bender , kormendy & dehnen 1996 ) .",
    "such a model fits the observed line - of - sight velocity profile shapes without any adjustable parameters , suggesting that the df of m32 is indeed close to the @xmath7 form .",
    "we recently completed the most detailed study to date of m32 ( van der marel 1997a ) , using new hst data ( van der marel , de zeeuw & rix 1997b ) and fully general three - integral modeling ( van der marel 1997c ; hereafter vdm97c ) .",
    "the main results of these studies are that : ( i ) m32 _ must _ have a central dark mass in the range @xmath16 ( at the formal @xmath17% confidence level ) , enclosed within @xmath18 , most likely a bh ; and ( ii ) the best - fitting models have a dynamical structure that is indeed similar ( although not identical ) to that of an @xmath7 model .",
    "although dynamical models with @xmath7 dfs can reproduce most features of the m32 data , they must also be stable if they are to be physically meaningful .",
    "only limited research has been done on the stability of @xmath7 models .",
    "bending modes and lopsided modes in extremely flattened systems ( axial ratio @xmath19 ) were discussed by merritt & fridman ( 1995 ) .",
    "kuijken & dubinski ( 1994 ) performed n - body simulations of models with a king - type mass density profile and an axial ratio varying between @xmath20 in the center and @xmath21 in the outer parts .",
    "models with little or no mean streaming were stable , but rapidly rotating models were found to be unstable to the formation of a bar .",
    "preliminary results on the bar - stability in @xmath7 models with central density cusps , but without central dark objects , were presented by dehnen ( 1996 ) .",
    "his n - body simulations indicate that : ( i ) non - rotating models are stable , even if they are as flat as @xmath8 ; and ( ii ) maximally rotating models tend to be bar - unstable if they are flatter than @xmath22 . the most detailed study to date of the stability of @xmath7 models has been that for a family of kuzmin - kutuzov models by sellwood & valluri ( 1997 ) .",
    "they identify all the most important unstable modes as a function of shape and rotational support .",
    "their results confirm the main conclusions on bar modes found by earlier authors , and they also present detailed studies of lopsided , bending and other unstable modes . the introduction of their paper provides a useful reference to other recent work on the stability of hot stellar systems ( see also the introductory chapter of robijn 1995 ) .",
    "none of the previous studies included both a central density cusp and a central black hole , as is appropriate for m32 .",
    "if m32 is being viewed edge - on , its intrinsic axial ratio is @xmath23 .",
    "the galaxy must be intrinsically flatter if it is inclined with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the observed rotation velocities imply that , over the radial range @xmath24 for which kinematical data is available , 8590% of the stars ( more - or - less independent of the assumed inclination ) must have the same sense of rotation around the symmetry axis ( van der marel 1994 ) .",
    "the previous work on the stability of @xmath7 models suggests that the m32 models should certainly be stable to , e.g. , lopsided and bending modes ( unless for extreme inclinations ) , but that they might be unstable to bar modes .",
    "we therefore tested the stability of the @xmath7 models for m32 through n - body simulations on a parallel supercomputer .",
    "our results are described in what follows .",
    "section  2 summarizes our choice of models , sections 3 describes the n - body technique , and section  4 discusses the results of the simulations .",

    "the parameters are set to @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the distance to m32 is assumed to be @xmath38 .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 is the luminosity density , and @xmath40 is the average v - band mass - to - light ratio of the stellar population . both @xmath40 and @xmath27 are assumed to be constant with radius .",
    "this model provides an accurate fit to the observed surface brightness profile of m32 , including the available hst photometry in the central few arcsec ( lauer 1992 ) . the adopted constant",
    "@xmath41 provides a good approximation in the central @xmath42 , although at larger radii the observed ellipticity increases slowly to @xmath43 at @xmath44 .",
    "the model has finite mass , and two free parameters : the inclination @xmath28 and the mass - to - light ratio @xmath40 .",
    "the results of this paper do not depend on the particular parametrization  ( [ massdens ] ) that is used to characterize the m32 luminosity density .",
    "the ( positive ) gravitational potential of m32 is assumed to be @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the potential generated by the luminous matter with mass density  ( [ massdens ] ) , and @xmath47 is the potential of a nuclear massive dark object .",
    "the latter is taken to be the ` softened point mass ' potential @xmath48 this is the potential generated by a cluster with a plummer model mass density ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "for the case of a nuclear bh ( i.e. , a point mass ) the potential is keplerian and @xmath49 .",
    "we do not include the potential of a dark halo around m32 ; there are no ( strong ) observational constraints on the possible presence and characteristics of such a dark halo .",
    "also , if anything , adding a dark halo probably has a stabilizing effect ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ; stiavelli & sparke 1991 ) , and omitting a dark halo is therefore conservative in the present context .    in vdm97c , models with two- and three - integral dfs",
    "are constructed to interpret the available kinematic m32 data .",
    "two - integral models do not reproduce all features of the data , but come close .",
    "the more general three - integral modeling shows indeed that the best - fitting models do not have two - integral dfs .",
    "however , they have a similar dynamical structure : @xmath50 , whereas for two - integral models @xmath51 . because the construction of @xmath52-body initial conditions is significantly more complicated for three - integral than for two - integral dfs",
    ", we restrict ourselves here to testing only the stability of the two - integral models for m32 .",
    "we do not expect the results to be much different for more general models .    for a given gravitational potential",
    "there is a unique _ even _",
    "df @xmath53 that reproduces the mass density @xmath54 . for our models we calculated this df as described in vdm97c .",
    "the _ total _",
    "df is the sum of the part @xmath55 that is even in @xmath11 and the part @xmath56 that is odd in @xmath11 . in principle @xmath56",
    "is determined completely by the mean streaming velocities @xmath57 , but these are not constrained well enough by the data to make an inversion feasible .",
    "we therefore adopt a convenient parametrization for the odd part : @xmath58 , \\label{fodddef}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the maximum angular momentum at a given energy .",
    "the function @xmath60 is a smoothed step function as defined in van der marel ( 1994 ) , with the parameter @xmath61 regulating the step - smoothness .",
    "for any given potential , the free parameters @xmath62 and @xmath61 can be specified so as to best fit the observed rotation velocities .",
    "our results should not depend sensitively on the particular choice of parametrization adopted here .",
    "we chose to simulate models with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , using @xmath2512,000 particles .",
    "the use of a softened dark object in this context ( rather than a point mass ) was motivated by numerical considerations .",
    "however , the adopted value of @xmath66 is not inconsistent with the kinematic observations ( vdm97c ; the size of the smallest hst / fos aperture is @xmath67 ) .",
    "there are no independent constraints on the inclination of m32 , and we therefore studied models with two representative values : @xmath3 ( edge - on ) and @xmath4 .",
    "these models have intrinsic axial ratios @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . for both inclinations we characterized the odd part of the df by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which provides an adequate fit to the observed rotation velocities .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio was chosen to be @xmath70 for @xmath3 , and @xmath71 for @xmath4 . a more complete study of the influence of the assumed inclination on the stability of the models would be interesting , but also expensive in terms of computing resources .",
    "appendix  a describes how initial conditions were generated from the df .",
    "the most straightforward approach is to use equal - mass particles .",
    "however , even with @xmath2512,000 equal - mass particles , the resolution near the center is poor .",
    "the solid histogram in figure  1 shows the number of particles as function of radius @xmath72 for the @xmath4 model with equal - mass particles . to improve the resolution it is useful to adopt a spectrum of particle masses , such that particles near the center are on average less massive",
    "this can be achieved by choosing the particle mass @xmath73 to be a decreasing function of the binding energy @xmath10 .",
    "a convenient choice is @xmath74 \\ > / \\ > [ r_{\\psi}(e)+r_1 ]                            \\",

    "after some experimentation , a mass spectrum was adopted with parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this yields a particle distribution that well samples the density cusp around the dark nuclear object , as well as the main body of the galaxy ( figure  1 , dotted curve ) . for these multi - mass models",
    "( with @xmath2512,000 ) , particles with @xmath81 have @xmath82 , while particles with @xmath83 have @xmath84 .",
    "figure  2 shows a scatter plot of the particle mass @xmath73 as a function of radius for the @xmath4 multi - mass model .",
    "we performed n - body simulations on the cray t3d parallel supercomputer at the pittsburgh supercomputing center .",
    "the ` self - consistent field ' ( scf ) code developed by hernquist & ostriker ( 1992 ) was used , implemented for parallel architectures as described in hernquist , sigurdsson & bryan ( 1995 ) and sigurdsson ( 1997 ) .    to improve the accuracy of the particle integration near the black hole , and to allow the smoothing length for the black hole to be small , the previously used standard time centered leap - frog integrator was replaced by a fourth order hermite integration scheme ( makino 1991 ; makino & aarseth 1992 ) . while the leapfrog has the virtue of being both simple and symplectic , a fixed time step leapfrog is vulnerable to spurious numerical scattering of orbits when potential gradients are large , e.g. , in steep density cusps and deep in keplerian potentials .",
    "choosing a small enough fixed time step for the leapfrog integrator to be completely free of numerical scattering in the center is highly inefficient .",
    "a hermite scheme provides a higher order , but relatively cheap integration scheme which excels at adapting to rapidly changing force terms . since the hermite scheme is not symplectic , global energy conservation is limited by the poisson noise in the global potential due to the discrete realization of the potential field ( see sigurdsson & mihos 1997 for a discussion ) .",
    "a variable time step scheme was used , where the minimum time step was set by the minimum time step for any particle , using aarseth s condition on the force derivatives ( aarseth 1985 ; makino & aarseth 1992 ) . to improve accuracy near the center ( where time scales are short ) ,",
    "while not slowing down the entire calculation too much , a modified two level ` multistep ' approach was used ( sigurdsson & mihos 1997 ) in which the accelerations due to the central massive object and the self - gravity of the innermost group of particles are updated more often than for the bulk of the particles at large radii .",
    "this approach speeds up the calculations by an order of magnitude relative to a single step integration .",
    "compared to the multistep approach that we used previously ( hernquist , sigurdsson & bryan 1995 ) this approach is about twice as fast at fixed integration precision .",
    "the adaptive time step scheme is essential when the cusp is well resolved by the particle realization and the black hole smoothing length is small , to follow the particles near the center where forces and jerks are large .",
    "the expansion uses a hernquist ( 1990 ) model as its lowest order term , for which @xmath85 at small radii . for the case of m32 the scale - length of this model",
    "was chosen to be @xmath86 .",
    "this minimizes the contribution to the potential from the higher - order terms in the expansion .",
    "the calculations are done with units in which @xmath87 . in these dimensionless units ,",
    "the smoothing length is @xmath88 , and the central dark mass is @xmath89 . in this system of units ,",
    "time is measured in units of @xmath90 yrs , and the periods of circular orbits at radii of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "we performed small simulations with 25,600 and 51,200 particles to test the dependence of the results on the number of radial and angular terms in the scf expansion .",
    "based on these results we adopted @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the final simulations .",
    "non - zero @xmath99 terms were included in the expansion to allow any non - axisymmetric instabilities to develop .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the accuracy of the scf expansion , by comparing its circular velocity to that of the true model potential . at small radii the _ stellar _ contribution to the circular velocity is poorly represented , due to the finite number of radial terms in the scf expansion ; in fact , increasing @xmath100 by a small amount does not lead to a significantly improved fit .",
    "however , the _ total _ circular velocity is well represented for all @xmath101 , because it is dominated by the central dark object at the small radii where the scf expansion fails . only at radii @xmath102",
    "does the numerical approximation to the total circular velocity become poor , and only as a result of the numerically imposed softening ( which causes the circular velocity at @xmath103 to be dominated by the stellar density cusp , rather than by the dark object ) .    in principle",
    ", the potential could have been represented more accurately by using another set of basis functions .",
    "a basis set that has @xmath104 at small radii for its lowest order term , with @xmath30 as in equation  ( [ massdens ] ) , would probably provide a better description for m32 .",
    "such basis sets can indeed be constructed ( saha 1993 ; dehnen 1996 ; zhao 1996 ) , but in practice are generally more difficult to implement and slower in use . the fact that in our application the potential at small radii is dominated by the dark object , justifies our use of the more conventional hernquist & ostriker ( 1992 ) basis set .",
    "we also used smaller simulations to make a proper choice for the time integration parameters . in the final simulations the smallest step size ( near the center )",
    "was typically @xmath105 in dimensionless units , with the step size at larger radii being @xmath10650 times larger .",
    "global energy conservation was about 0.5% over @xmath107 .",
    "one of the more useful diagnostics to monitor in the simulations is the evolution of the axial ratios of the mass distribution as a function of radius . for this we used an iterative scheme similar to that used by dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) .",
    "a mass bin is adopted that contains a fixed fraction of the total mass ( e.g. , the central 010% ) .",
    "the moment of inertia tensor is calculated for the particles that fall in the bin , and diagonalization then yields the axial ratios @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( the eigenvalues of the tensor ) and the angles of the principal axes with respect to the initial coordinate axes .",
    "iteration is required because the sorting of the particles in the ellipsoidal radial coordinate depends on the angles and axial ratios .",
    "we found that the algorithm has convergence problems when the number of particles is small , or at small radii .",
    "to improve this , we made modifications to the basic algorithm to allow the mass fraction to vary , to ensure that the centroid of the particles in the bin was at all times well inside their mean ellipsoidal radius .",
    "iteration was done by taking the geometric mean of the derived axial ratio and the previously derived axial ratio .",
    "this provides for stabler convergence of the shape parameters , and allowed sensible axial ratio estimates to be obtained for a large range in radius ( see also sigurdsson & mihos 1997 ) .",
    "we ran an equal - mass model and a multi - mass model for each inclination .",
    "the equal - mass simulations were run to @xmath110 for the @xmath3 model , and to @xmath111 for the @xmath4 model , to explore global stability and stability at large radii .",
    "the multi - mass models were run to @xmath112 to explore stability at small radii .",
    "the main result is that _ the models for both inclinations are dynamically stable .",
    "_ we illustrate this by discussing and displaying the time evolution for the @xmath4 model .",
    "the results for the edge - on model are similar .",
    "figure  4 shows the initial and final mass densities .",
    "figure  5 shows the evolution of the axial ratios @xmath108 and @xmath109 for four radial bins . at small radii we display the results from the multi - mass models , and at large radii those from the equal - mass models .",
    "there are no evolutionary trends in the mass distribution .",
    "the axial ratios are constant at their values for the continuous limit ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) , to within the accuracy imposed by the finite number of particles .",
    "the orientation of the principal axes of the mass distribution also showed no trends with time .",
    "a more sensitive diagnostic of possible instabilities is provided by an analysis of the individual expansion terms of the mass distribution .",
    "such an analysis is straightforward , because the scf technique makes a harmonic decomposition of the density and potential at each time step .",
    "figure  6 shows the time evolution of some of the expansion terms , in particular those that could have been expected to show signatures of an instability . however , there is no sign of even a weak lopsided ( @xmath115 ) or bar ( @xmath116 ) instability .",
    "other expansion terms showed the same result of constant amplitudes with time , to within the noise limits imposed by the discreteness of the model .    not only the mass distribution is stable , but also the phase - space structure of the model .",
    "figure  7 shows for the multi - mass model the initial and final mean azimuthal velocity @xmath117 , and the rms velocities @xmath118^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath119^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath120^{1/2}$ ] , all as a function of the spheroidal radius @xmath99 .",
    "there is some evolution in the velocities at radii close to the softening scale @xmath66 , due to small number statistics and the finite resolution of the scf expansion .",
    "overall , however , the velocity structure of the model is stable .",
    "the equality of @xmath119^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath120^{1/2}$ ] is consistent with the @xmath7 form of the df .",
    "figure  8 shows that the model remains in virial equilibrium throughout , as expected from the stability of both the mass distribution and the kinematic structure .",
    "two integral @xmath7 models with a central bh provide a reasonable fit to the observed kinematics of m32 .",
    "previous work indicated that @xmath7 models with as much rotation as m32 could be bar - unstable , but none of the previous studies took into account both a central cusp in the mass density and a central bh .",
    "we therefore constructed particle realizations of @xmath7 models for m32 , and calculated their time evolution using a scf n - body code on a cray t3d parallel supercomputer .",
    "models were studied for two representative inclinations , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , corresponding to intrinsic axial ratios of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . both these models were found to be dynamically stable .",
    "this result has two implications .",
    "first , the equilibrium models that best fit the kinematic data for m32 are stable , and therefore physically meaningful .",
    "second , imposing the requirement of stability on the models does not put very stringent constraints on the inclination or the intrinsic axial ratio of the models .    previous work on the stability of @xmath7 models has shown that the @xmath116 bar - mode is the only mode that might be unstable for systems rounder than @xmath8 , and that the susceptibility to this instability increases with flattening and rotation rate ( dehnen 1996 ; sellwood & valluri 1997 ) . here",
    "we have shown that @xmath7 models for m32 as flat as @xmath6 are stable .",
    "combined with the fact that m32 has a higher rotation rate @xmath121 than nearly all other elliptical galaxies ( m32 rotates more rapidly than an oblate isotropic rotator ; van der marel 1994 ) , this suggests that all @xmath7 models with @xmath9 that are constructed to fit real galaxies will generally be stable .",
    "this might in fact be true even for flatter models , but that is not something that can be addressed with the results presented here .",
    "nonetheless , the general applicability of @xmath7 models to real galaxies remains unclear .",
    "two independent lines of observational evidence suggest that elliptical galaxies , especially those flatter than e2 , can not have @xmath7 dfs .",
    "the models tend to possess too much motion on the major axis relative to the minor axis ( binney , davies & illingworth 1990 ; van der marel 1991 ) , and line - of - sight velocity profiles that are too flat - topped ( bender , saglia & gerhard 1994 ) .",
    "either way , the relative simplicity of these models and their demonstrated use for the case of m32 , are likely to leave them as a popular tool for the interpretation of stellar kinematic data for some time to come .",
    "a more detailed study of the general stability properties of @xmath7 models is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , it will certainly be of interest to study the influence of a central dark object on the stability of flattened rotating models , and , more generally , to search for evolution in the region close to the dark object as it grows with time .",
    "parallel n - body integration algorithms such as those used here are well suited to address these issues .",
    "the longest simulation we ran covered @xmath122 yrs .",
    "this is many dynamical times in the central region of m32 , and therefore sufficient to test dynamical stability .",
    "however , it is only 1% of the hubble time , and therefore insufficient for a study of very slow secular evolution .",
    "although collisionless secular evolution need not necessarily be present , m32 will certainly suffer some secular evolution as a result of two - body relaxation ; the relaxation time in the inner regions is only @xmath123 yrs , independent of radius ( lauer 1992 ) .",
    "simulations that address the effects of this relaxation using a hybrid direct / scf n - body code are in progress ( hemsendorf , spurzem & sigurdsson 1997 ) .",
    "more complicated simulations are required to also include the effects of mass loss due to stellar evolution and stellar collisions , which operate on similar time scales .",
    "we are grateful to tim de zeeuw , kathryn johnston , chris mihos , gerry quinlan , hans - walter rix and rainer spurzem , for helpful discussions , useful comments , and for collaboration in various related projects .",
