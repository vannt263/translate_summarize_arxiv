    "experiments with the clas detector at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) have accumulated extensive and accurate data of meson electroproduction reactions on protons .",
    "detailed experimental data have now become available for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 exclusive channels @xcite .",
    "in addition first electroproduction data for the channels with smaller cross sections , such as the @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , have also been obtained with clas @xcite .",
    "review of these clas experimental results may be found in the papers @xcite .",
    "these data combined will allow us to determine the electromagnetic transition amplitudes for the majority of nucleon resonances ( @xmath10 ) in a wide range of photon virtualities @xmath2 from 0.2 to 5.0 gev@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath2 evolution of these amplitudes contains information on the relevant degrees of freedom in the nucleon resonance structure at varying distance scales .",
    "it also allows to explore the strong interaction mechanisms responsible for baryon formation and their relationship to qcd @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 exclusive channels are two major contributors to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 reactions in the resonance excitation region .",
    "they are strongly coupled through hadronic interactions of the final @xmath11 and @xmath12 states @xcite thus an understanding of the reaction mechanisms for these two channels is vital for extracting the @xmath15-@xmath10 transition amplitudes at various photon virtualities .",
    "it is also a necessary first step towards the exploration of @xmath16 s in the mass region above 1.5 gev using other exclusive channels with smaller cross sections , such as @xmath8 , @xmath17 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the cross sections of these weaker channels can be affected considerably by the @xmath11 and @xmath12 channels because of unitarity condition .",
    "the mechanisms of the @xmath11 electroproduction have been extensively studied .",
    "the most comprehensive recent studies are by the efforts at mami @xcite , gwu @xcite and jlab @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the study of @xmath12 electroproduction mechanisms is still limited . in this work",
    "we try to improve the situation by analyzing the recently published clas data of @xmath0 channel @xcite .",
    "the world data on @xmath7 electroproduction in the resonance excitation region were rather scarce before the clas experiments .",
    "they were limited to integrated cross sections , various invariant mass distributions , and @xmath18 angular distributions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the large binning in @xmath4 and @xmath2 does not allow the determination of @xmath16 parameters from these data .",
    "first detailed measurements of @xmath0 electroproduction cross sections with clas were reported in @xcite . the new clas @xmath0 data @xcite use binnings of @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 0.05 gev@xmath21 , and are much more precise than the previous data .",
    "for the first time nine sets of 1-fold differential cross sections were determined in the region of 1.3 @xmath1 w @xmath1 1.6 gev and 0.25 @xmath1 q@xmath3 @xmath1 0.60 gev@xmath3 .",
    "they consist of invariant mass distributions of the final @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and the angular distributions for all final state particles , as will be described in the section  [ xsect ] .",
    "all cross sections measured in this reaction and in others clas experiments may be found in @xcite .",
    "several models have been developed for analyzing the double pion photoproduction @xcite and electroproduction @xcite reactions in the nucleon resonance excitation region , beginning with the pioneering effort of @xcite .",
    "they are based on the tree - diagrams of effective meson - baryon lagrangians and have been reasonably successful in describing the very limited data of the fully integrated cross sections and the invariant mass distributions .",
    "it remains to be seen , to what extent these models can describe the recent clas data .",
    "a comparison between these model predictions and @xmath12 cross sections ( e.g.  @xcite ) clearly showed the necessity for further improvements of reaction models in order to isolate the resonant contribution and to determine nucleon resonance parameters from the data .",
    "comprehensive clas data on various differential @xmath0 cross open up new opportunities for phenomenological data analysis . by studying the kinematic dependencies of the differential cross section and their correlations we are able to establish the presence and strength of the relevant reaction mechanisms and to achieve reliable separation of resonant and non - resonant contributions .",
    "in this paper we apply a phenomenological approach developed in the past several years by the jefferson laboratory - moscow state university ( jm ) collaboration @xcite , to analyze the clas data @xcite on @xmath0 electroproduction at @xmath4 @xmath1 1.6 gev . within the jm model developed up to 2005 ,",
    "called jm05 , the major part of @xmath0 production at @xmath4 @xmath1 1.6 gev is due to contributions from the @xmath25 isobar channels . the @xmath26 ( 1232 )",
    "resonance is clearly seen in all @xmath23 mass distributions at w @xmath27 1.4 gev , while other mass distributions do not show any structures .",
    "the contributions from all other isobar channels @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 included in jm05 @xcite are negligible in the near - threshold and sub - threshold regions . thus these channels are not included to this work . the @xmath32 production amplitude within jm05",
