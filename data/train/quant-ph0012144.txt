    "classically , a beam of light falling on a mirror exerts a force and the force can be written as the integral of the maxwell stress tensor .",
    "when we treat this problem quantum mechanically , then the force undergoes fluctuations .",
    "this is a necessary consequence of the fact that physically realizable quantum states are not eigenstates of the stress tensor operator .",
    "these radiation pressure fluctuations play an important role in limiting the sensitivity of laser interferometer detectors of gravitational radiation , as was first analyzed by caves  @xcite .",
    "his approach is based on the photon number fluctuations in a coherent state , and we will refer to it as the photon number approach .",

    "this requires the correlation function of a pair of stress tensor operators , which will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : emtf ] .",
    "there it is shown that the correlation function can be decomposed into three parts , a term which is fully normal - ordered , a state independent vacuum term , and a `` cross term '' which can be viewed as an interference term between the vacuum fluctuations and the matter content of the quantum state .",
    "it is this cross term which will be of greatest interest in this paper , as it is responsible for the radiation pressure fluctuations in a coherent state .",
    "these fluctuations will be discussed in sect .",

    "the analysis will be done first using the photon number approach , and then using the stress tensor approach . in the latter case ,",
    "we show how the calculations may be performed in coordinate space , where an integration over space and time is needed to remove a singularity in the cross term .",
    "we then show how to obtain the same result more simply using a othonormal basis of wavepacket modes . in sect .",

    "we first study the effects of mutiple bounces in a single arm , and reproduce the result  @xcite that the effect of the radiation pressure fluctuations grows as the square of the number of bounces .",
    "we also show how our approach may be used to discuss the situation where the interferometer arms are fabry - perot cavities .",

    "it is well known that stress tensor operators can be renormalized by normal ordering : @xmath0 which is subtraction of the minkowski vacuum expectation value . however , the quantity @xmath1 is still divergent in the limit that @xmath2 .",
    "the divergent part of this quantity can be decomposed into a state - independent part and a state - dependent part .",
    "to do so , we may use the following identity , which follows from wick s theorem @xmath3 here the @xmath4 are free bosonic fields and @xmath5 denotes the minkowski vacuum expectation value .",

    "the singularity of the cross term is of particular significance because , unlike the vacuum term , it is state - dependent .",
    "the fully normal - ordered term will not contribute to the fluctuations so long as the quantum state is a coherent state .",
    "the pure vacuum term will also not contribute so long as we restrict our attention to the differences between a given quantum state and the vacuum state .",
    "if the quantum state is other than a coherent state , there are also state - dependent stress tensor fluctuations in the fully normal ordered term . these fluctuations were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , especially in a context where the stress tensor is the source of gravity .",
    "the normal ordered term is always finite and does not present a divergence problem , in contrast to the cross term .",
    "the latter term can only be made meaningful if one examines space or time integrated quantities and has a prescription for defining the resulting integrals .",
    "we may schematically express the expectation value of a product of stress tensor operators as @xmath13 where the three terms of the right hand side are , respectively , the fully normal ordered term , the cross term , and the vacuum term .",
    "for a single mode coherent state @xmath14 , @xmath15 in such a state , the fluctuations of the stress tensor are described by quantities of the form @xmath16 if we are interested only in the changes in @xmath17 when the quantum state is varied , then the pure vacuum term can be ignored , and only the cross term is important : @xmath18    note that we do not mean to suggest that there is no physical meaning to the pure vacuum term",

    "more precisely , if one measures a spacetime averaged component , the result of the measurement should undergo fluctuations which vary as an inverse power of the size of the averaging region .",
    "however , in a non - vacuum state , the magnitude of the cross term will grow as the mean energy density in the state .",
    "thus there will be a regime in which the effects of the cross term dominate those of the vacuum term .",
    "we must resolve the issue of the state - dependent divergences in the cross term if it is to have any physical content .",

    "the radiation pressure should undergo fluctuations about this mean . in the photon number viewpoint ,",
    "these fluctuations arise from fluctuations in the rate of photons striking the surface . in the stress tensor viewpoint ,",
    "the fluctuations arise because the quantum state of the radiation field is not an eigenstate of pressure .",

    "it is well known that one can calculate the force on a surface by integration of the relevant component of the stress tensor over that surface .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to expect that the fluctuations in this force can also be computed from the quantum stress tensor .",
    "there is , however , a problem which needs to be resolved in this approach .",
    "this is that products of stress tensor operators are not well defined at coincident points .",
