    "the energy  density  functional ( edf ) theory was developed in nuclear physics in the last decades . in this theoretical framework , the energy of the system is computed by using functionals of the density , which are usually derived from effective interactions @xcite , with some exceptions ( see , for instance , the work reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . mean  field  type models constitute the basis on which this theory was constructed starting from the 70s .",
    "such models represent have strong analogies with the leading order of the many  body dyson perturbative expansion @xcite , based on the independent  particle approximation , and are currently applied to numerous many  particle systems .",
    "mean  field  based models are extensively employed in the study of medium  mass and heavy nuclei , and are particularly successful in describing with a good accuracy a large number of known masses and radii . despite this success ,",
    "more sophisticated beyond  mean  field models are necessary , for instance , to perform accurate spectroscopic analyses for nuclear ground states or to provide reliable descriptions of the physical fragmentation of nuclear excitations . in these cases , additional correlations , with respect to what is contained in a mean  field picture , have to be included in the theoretical scheme .",
    "going beyond the mean field , with respect to the many ",
    "body dyson perturbative expansion , implies including higher orders .",
    "this is a challenging task to accomplish for several reasons : among them , the highly increased numerical cost , and the conceptual problems implied by the choice of the interaction to be used . some of these problems are mentioned in what follows . within the edf theory ,",
    "the currently used density functionals are usually produced by phenomenological interactions or lagrangians in the non relativistic and relativistic cases , respectively .",
    "skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite forces are the most used interactions in the non relativistic framework . the fitting procedure of their parameters is performed with mean  field calculations for nuclear matter and some chosen nuclei .",
    "it is obvious that , if such interactions are used in cases where higher orders are explicitly included in the theoretical models , double  counting problems arise . furthermore , in those cases where the effective interactions have a zero range",
    ", ultraviolet divergences may occur beyond the mean field and have to be treated .",
    "our objective is to construct a generalized edf framework , where new effective interactions are introduced , which are now designed to treat both matter and finite nuclei in beyond ",
    "mean  field models , avoiding double  counting problems and regularizing ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we started this work with the skyrme interaction moghraprl , moghra2012 - 1,moghra2012 - 2 .",
    "second  order calculations were performed to compute the equation of state ( eos ) of symmetric , neutron , and asymmetric matter .",
    "first , only symmetric matter and a simplified form of the skyrme interaction ( contact interaction with a density  dependent coupling constant ) were analyzed @xcite .",
    "this simplified skyrme model corresponds to the so  called @xmath0 model , where the velocity ",
    "dependent , the spin ",
    "orbit , and the tensor terms of the skyrme force are omitted .",
    "the second  order contribution was evaluated analytically and its cutoff  dependent part was identified .",
    "the divergent part was found to have a linear asymptotic behavior with respect to a momentum cutoff .",
    "the set of parameters ( three in that case ) were adjusted on a benchmark eos for several values of the cutoff .",
    "these parameter sets were recently employed in a simplified test ",
    "calculation for the nucleus @xmath1o @xcite .",
    "the second  order correction to the total binding energy was evaluated in this nucleus and encouraging results were found indicating a reasonable convergence with respect to the chosen cutoff .",
    "we then performed the same type of procedure ( analytical derivation of the second  order contribution and adjustment of the parameters ) by including also the velocity  dependent terms in the skyrme interaction .",
    "two directions were explored , namely : ( i ) keeping the cutoff  dependent terms @xcite , and ( ii ) applying the dimensional regularization technique to extract only the finite part @xcite .",
    "we have recently realized that some aspects of the formal derivation on which both studies @xcite and @xcite were based are not correct and we aim here at providing the correct full formulae and results . for the sake of clarity and to present a self - contained reference on the topic , we provide here all the needed details referring previous literature , new formulae and , for an easy comparison with refs .",
    "@xcite , the same type of figures .",
    "in addition , we illustrate the effect on the eos related to the inclusion of the proper rearrangement terms at second order .",
    "rearrangement terms were neglected in refs .",
    "the general way of computing them in beyond ",
    "mean  field models was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet divergence at second order is handled in two ways : ( i ) by using a cutoff regularization , as in ref .",
    "moghra2012 - 1 .",
    "the cutoff  dependent results are adjusted on a benchmark eos and several sets of parameters are generated for each chosen value of the cutoff ; ( ii ) by applying the dimensional  regularization procedure .",
    "only the finite parts of the second  order corrections are thus extracted as in ref . @xcite and the cutoff ",
    "dependent part is eliminated by the dimensional regularization .",
    "a unique set of parameters is thus produced by adjusting on a benchmark eos .",
    "as a first approximation , in the first part of the article we replace the effective mass @xmath2 with the bare mass @xmath3 , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite ( this approximation will be abandoned in the last part of the article ) .",
    "we find in this case that the finite part of the eos calculated for symmetric and neutron matter is coherent with the recent results shown in ref .",
    "kaiser . differently from ref .",
    "@xcite : ( 1 ) tensor and spin ",
    "orbit parts are omitted for simplicity in the interaction . for the tensor part , this is first justified by the fact that many currently used skyrme interactions do not contain such terms .",
    "spin  orbit and tensor terms do not contribute to the first ",
    "order eos . in principle",
    ", they contribute when the second order is included ; , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the parameters that tune the spin ",
    "orbit ( @xmath7 ) and tensor ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) terms introduced in ref . @xcite . ] ( 2 ) we also calculate the cutoff ",
    "dependent part in the second  order contribution because we perform a cutoff regularization ; ( 3 ) also asymmetric matter is treated here ; ( 4 ) the density  dependent part of the skyrme interaction is not omitted .",
    "it is well known that this term is necessary to reproduce the correct saturation point of symmetric matter at first order . in ref .",
    "kaiser it is stressed that this term is indeed necessary for properly reproducing the saturation density of symmetric matter also at second order .",
    "the second  order curves obtained there by omitting the density  dependent term do not reproduce at all the saturation point providing a saturation density of @xmath8 0.22 @xmath9 . it is well known that the inclusion of such term may be problematic in many respects ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "several drawbacks related to the density dependence were identified such as , for instance , the existence of pathologies in some applications of the generator ",
    "coordinate method @xcite .",
    "our pragmatic choice is to use density  dependent interactions as a starting point in our work because of their good performance , and we leave for a future work the discussion of the associated problems .",
    "note that , despite the explicit density dependence in the interaction , the hugenholtz - van howe theorem @xcite is satisfied in the skyrme case whenever the proper rearrangement terms ( associated to the density dependence ) are explicitly introduced , as is usually done within the random  phase approximation ( rpa ) and as was recently done also in the specific case of the second rpa @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite pointed out that the matrix elements of the interaction used for the computation of the energy in second ",
    "order perturbation theory are related to @xmath10 rpa matrix elements .",
    "the rpa residual interaction ( second derivative of the hartree - fock energy functional @xcite , which automatically includes the rearrangement terms ) has thus to be used to calculate the second  order energy correction . as a first approximation , as done in refs . @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we neglect rearrangement terms .",
    "we then include them ( together with the effective mass ) in the last part of the article for symmetric and neutron matter and provide sets of parameters where their effect is taken into account .",
    "such sets of parameters may be considered a very reasonable starting point to construct a bridge between infinite matter , where our effective regularized interactions are presently adjusted , and finite nuclei , where we eventually plan to employ them .",
    "we analyze here the second  order integrals using two choices for the momentum cutoff .",
    "while the numerical monte carlo integration is performed with a cutoff ( @xmath11 ) on the transferred momentum @xmath12 , it turns out that the use of a cutoff ( @xmath13 ) on the outgoing relative momentum @xmath14 is more convenient for the analytical derivation .",
    "this choice is analogous to that adopted for instance in the low  momentum interaction @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the analytical derivation is performed here only for symmetric and pure neutron matter . for asymmetric matter",
    ", we solve numerically the second  order integrals with the monte carlo method . to present a coherent analysis of the obtained results and discuss figures with a unique choice for the momentum cutoff , we show in this article , in the case of the cutoff regularization , second  order eos s obtained in all cases numerically , with a cutoff equal to @xmath11 .",
