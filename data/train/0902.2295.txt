    "the study of @xmath1 resonances can provide us with critical insight into the nature of qcd in the confinement domain  @xcite . in the study of the @xmath1 resonances ,",
    "there are two long - standing central issues .",
    "first , many @xmath1 states predicted by quark models have not been observed in experiments  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , so - called missing @xmath1 problem .",
    "second , the properties of the lowest well - established @xmath1 resonances , @xmath3 and @xmath7 , are still not well determined experimentally  @xcite and not well understood theoretically  @xcite .",
    "as the lowest excited nucleon state , the roper resonance @xmath3 was first deduced by @xmath8 phase shift analysis ; its structure has been arousing people s interests intensely all the time ; _ i.e. , _ it is lighter than the first odd - parity nucleon excitation , the @xmath7 , and has a significant branching ratio into two pions . up to now , although the existence of the roper resonance is well established ( four - star ranking in the particle data book ) , its properties , such as mass , width , and decay branching ratios , still suffer large experiment uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "there are many models on this roper resonance . in classical quark models ,",
    "the roper resonance has been associated with the first spin - parity @xmath9 radial excited state of the nucleon  @xcite . in the bag  @xcite and skyrme models",
    "@xcite , it was interpreted as surface oscillation , also called breathing mode . it has also been predicted as a monopole excitation of the nucleon with the gluonic excitation  @xcite or as dynamically generated from meson - nucleon interactions  @xcite . but",
    "these predictions always reach either a larger value for its mass or a much smaller one for its width and also meet difficulties in explaining its electromagnetic coupling  @xcite .    up to now",
    ", our knowledge on @xmath1 resonances has been mainly coming from @xmath8 and @xmath10 experiments .",
    "then those unobserved missing @xmath1 resonances may be due to their weak couplings to @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "even for the well - established roper resonance , its properties can be extracted only by detailed partial - wave analysis .",
    "no corresponding peak has been observed from the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum because of its nearby strong @xmath12 peak .",
    "a difficulty in extracting the @xmath1 information from these experiments is the isospin decomposition of @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 reactions have been used to study @xmath1 resonances with claimed observation of the roper resonance peak  @xcite due to their isospin filter effect  @xcite .",
    "however , because of the presence of large interfering contributions from other resonances , there is still considerable model dependence in extracting its properties .",
    "moreover , the data  @xcite from @xmath17 reaction are based on a preliminary analysis of the limited phase space , suffering a strong model dependence , and may have changed quite a bit in the course of the analysis , as suggested in a more recent paper by the same collaboration  @xcite .    in this work , we propose to study the roper and other @xmath1 resonances with the @xmath18 reaction , where thanks to the absence of the @xmath19 state , the contribution of the @xmath12 excitation is much smaller than that in the @xmath20 reaction .",
    "it is found that for the beam energy around 1.5 gev , the contribution of the roper resonance @xmath3 produced by the t - channel @xmath4 exchange dominates over all other contributions because of its known large coupling to @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this will provide the cleanest place for studying the properties of the roper resonance and the best place for looking for other missing @xmath1 resonances with large coupling to @xmath6 .",
    "such a reaction can be studied by the scheduled experiments on the proton antiproton detector array ( panda ) at the gsi facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) with the antiproton beam of kinetic energy ranging from 1 to 15 gev  @xcite .",
    "the detector with an almost @xmath21 detection coverage for both charged particles and photons can detect @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the final state .",
    "the neutron can be reconstructed from a missing mass spectrum against the @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "hence we suggest the panda collaboration pay good attention to the study of @xmath1 resonances , considering its unique advantages found in this work .    in the next section",
    ", we present the formalism and ingredients for the calculation of the @xmath18 reaction by including various intermediate @xmath1  and @xmath2 resonances .",
    "then in the sec.[s3 ] we give the numerical results of the calculation , compare this reaction to the @xmath24 reaction , and discuss the results .",
    "we study the @xmath25  reaction within an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "all the basic feynman diagrams involved in our calculation for this reaction are depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the formalism and ingredients are very similar to those used in the study of the @xmath26reaction  @xcite , where only @xmath3 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 resonances are found to play significant roles for the beam energy around @xmath30 gev . with the experience on the @xmath26reaction",
    ", we investigate here the contribution from these resonances to the present @xmath25reaction for the beam energy @xmath31 gev .",
    "first , we give the effective lagrangian densities for describing the meson-@xmath32 vertices : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the usual isospin-@xmath13 pauli matrix operator , and the coupling constants are all listed in table  [ tab1 ] . at each vertex , we need a relevant off - shell form factor for the exchanged meson . in this paper",
    ", we use the same form factors as assumed in the previous literature  @xcite : @xmath35 here m represents @xmath36 , @xmath4 , or @xmath37 mesons .",
    "the @xmath38 parameters as used in refs.@xcite for the @xmath39 reaction are also listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "note that for @xmath32 elastic scattering , the square of the four - momentum vector @xmath40 is equal to its corresponding three - momentum squared with a minus sign ; hence , in some literature , such as in the bonn model  @xcite , an equivalent formula of the form factor with the three - momentum is used .",
    "and ( b ) @xmath41 to the @xmath42 total cross sections with two sets of parameters : the same parameters as in ref.@xcite(solid curves ) and some parameters replaced by those in table.[tab3](dashed curves ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   and ( b ) @xmath41 to the @xmath42 total cross sections with two sets of parameters : the same parameters as in ref.@xcite(solid curves ) and some parameters replaced by those in table.[tab3](dashed curves ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    results with these parameters without adjustment to fit data from ref.@xcite are plotted for various mass spectra of the @xmath42 reaction at @xmath43 and @xmath44 gev , as shown by the dashed curves in figs.[fg3 ] and [ fg4 ] as a comparison to those results ( solid curves ) with the parameters of ref.@xcite . although quantitatively there are about 30%@xmath4550% uncertainty about the relative production rates of @xmath12 and @xmath3 resonances , qualitatively the main conclusion of the study is rather firm , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath41 should be clearly seen in the @xmath46 reaction and dominates the reaction at @xmath47 gev .    with a clear advantage for studying @xmath1 of the large @xmath6 coupling by the @xmath25  reaction ,",
    "finally let us discuss the experimental accessibility of this reaction .",
    "we know that the @xmath48 reaction will be studied by the panda ( anti - proton annihilation at darmstadt ) collaboration at fair with the @xmath23 beam energy in the range of 1.5 to 15 gev and luminosity of about @xmath49  @xcite . for our proposed @xmath1 study with the @xmath25  reaction ,",
    "the best beam energy range is 1.5 - 4 gev , with a cross section around 8 mb , which corresponds to an event production rate of @xmath50 per second at panda / fair .",
    "the panda is supposed to be a @xmath21 solid angle detector with good particle identification for charged particles and photons . for the @xmath25  reaction ,",
    "if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are identified , then the neutron can be easily reconstructed from the missing mass spectrum against @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "so this reaction should be easy accessible at panda / fair .    in summary , we find that the @xmath25  reaction provides an excellent place for studying properties of the roper @xmath41 resonance and any other @xmath1 resonances ( including some missing ones ) with large couplings to @xmath6 ; and the reaction is easily accessible by the forthcoming experiments at the panda / fair . with a large amount of data on the final states including",
    "baryon and antibaryon , the panda / fair could play an important role in the study of @xmath1 and hyperon excited states .    *",
