    "multi - pixel geiger - mode avalanche photodiodes ( g - apds ) are solid - state photodetectors based on a technology developed since early 1990 s @xcite .",
    "their gain is typically 10@xmath0 per photoelectron .",
    "their main features are : the small size , the efficiency comparable to the one of vacuum photomultipliers , the insensitivity to magnetic field , a low bias voltage and a reasonable price .",
    "currently , the g - apds find an application in many fields of physics , high - energy , neutrino , astroparticle and medicine .",
    "this paper describes the results of a comparative study performed in the same experimental conditions , on different g - apds , to allow an optimal choice with a view to a given application .",
    "we refer to elsewhere for a complete description of measurements and analysis methods  @xcite .",
    "a g - apd consists of a large number of identical microcells ( silicon diodes , pixels ) with a common anode .",
    "the microcells are located on a common substrate with a typical size of @xmath1 .",
    "once photoelectron are produced an electron avalanche multiplication may occur under a reverse bias , @xmath2 , above the breakdown voltage , @xmath3 and the charge induced during the avalanche discharge is proportional to the overvoltage ( @xmath4 -@xmath3 ) .",
    "the number of fired pixels is proportional to the initial number of photoelectrons , as long as this is on average less than one per pixel .",
    "this implies a low - intensity light source in the measurement setup . the gain ( g )",
    "is determined by the charge released in one pixel .",
    "other characteristics of the g - apd response to light deserve a few words .",
    "after - pulses ( ap ) appear when the quenching ( mechanism to stop the avalanche process by temporally reducing the cell voltage ) does nt drain all the charge in the sensitive area , and the cell fires again shortly after the original pulse .",
    "cross - talk takes place when in a geiger discharge , some of the electrons generated in the avalanche process reach the adjacent pixel , where another geiger discharge might be triggered .",
    "this results in a pulse with a larger amplitude ( nearly a factor two ) and in a distortion of the linear response of the device .",
    "every detector can only convert a certain percentage of incident photons in signals .",
    "this g - apd efficiency is given as product of three factors : @xmath5 where qe is the g - apd quantum efficiency , function of the incident photon wavelength , @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is a geometrical factor ( fill factor ) indicating which fraction of the device is sensitive to photons ; @xmath8 is the probability to trigger a geiger discharge and is function of @xmath2 .",
    "pde decreases with the pixel size .",
    "then , the g - apd response can be written as a product of few factors :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the number of incident photons ; g , the gain ; @xmath11 , the cross - talk probability and @xmath12 , the after - pulse probability .",
    "it should be noticed that in the above equation , g , pde , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are all increasing with @xmath2 , implying a complex dependence of the g - apd response on the bias voltage .",
    "figure [ fig : setup1 ] shows the scheme of the pde measurements .",
    "the light from a light - emitting diode ( led ) operating in a pulse - mode with a waveform generator ( agilent 33220a ) was delivered to an optical filter .",
    "the latter corresponded to the peak wavelength of the led and had a bandwidth of @xmath13 3 nm . by changing the led",
    ", a few wavelengths in the 380 @xmath14 650 nm range were investigated . for low intensity sources ( 380 nm , 400 nm , 565 nm ) the led light was not filtered .",
    "the filtered light was routed to a light - tight thermostabilized box with inside two photo - detectors : the g - apd and the reference photodetector .",
    "the box temperature was controlled at @xmath15 during the data taking . as a reference photodetector a photomultiplier tube ( pmt )",
    "h5783p produced and calibrated ( for this reference ) by hamamatsu was used . for each wavelength @xmath16 from the efficiency of the reference photodetector for the peak wavelength , as provided by the manufacturer , is derived the efficiency of the reference device , @xmath17 , for our light source , taking in account the filter bandwidth or the led full width half maximum .",
    "r0.5        the signal from g - apd is read out with a charge - sensitive preamplifier and digitized with an integrating adc ( caen qadc v792n ) .",
    "the led pulse of about @xmath18 duration and the adc gate of about @xmath19 width were synchronized by means of a common trigger .",
    "the integration time was long enough to contain most of g - apd signal . in case of the reference photodetector",
    "the direct signal from pmt was amplified with an external amplifier ( nim ortec 450 ) and digitized with the same adc .",
    "due to a high sensitivity to voltage variations , the g - apd bias voltage was provided by a high precise and stable in time voltage source ( keithley 6487/e ) .",
    "the measurements refer to the samples listed in tab . [",
    "tab : samples ] .",

    "since their contribution to the total noise is about 2% of the pedestal , the thermogeneration effect can be neglected in the signal fit .",
