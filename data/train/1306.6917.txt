    "the wormhole is a tunnel - like spacetime structure by which a shortcut or travel to disconnected world is possible .",

    "the earlier works are shown in the book written by visser@xcite and review paper by lobo@xcite . however , it is not trivial what is the mathematically rigorous and physically reasonable definition of wormhole in general situation , although we may find a wormhole structure in each individual case .",
    "hayward gave an elegant definition of wormhole by using trapping horizon and showed that the violation of the null energy condition is a necessary condition for the existence of the wormhole in the framework of general relativity , where the null energy condition is @xmath0 for any null vector @xmath1@xcite .",

    "it is very important to study the stability of wormhole model in order to know whether it is traversable .",
    "the stability against linear perturbations is a necessary condition for the traversable wormhole , but it is insufficient .",
    "the investigation of non - linear dynamical situation is necessary , and there are a few studies in this direction@xcite . in this paper , we study the condition that a wormhole persists even if it experiences non - linear disturbances . in our model , the wormhole is assumed to be supported by a spherical thin shell composed of the exotic matter , and hence the wormhole itself is also assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "the largest merit of a spherical thin shell wormhole is the finite number of its dynamical degrees of freedom . by virtue of this merit",
    ", we can analyze this model analytically even in highly dynamical cases .",
    "the thin shell wormhole was first devised by visser@xcite , and then its stability against linear perturbations was investigated by poisson and visser@xcite .",
