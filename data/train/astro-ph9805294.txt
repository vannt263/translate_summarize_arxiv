    "since the early papers on the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( cmb ) by peebles &  yu ( 1968 ) , doroshkevich , zeldovich , &  sunyaev ( 1978 ) , wilson &  silk ( 1981 ) and others , it has been evident that the cmb anisotropies are sensitive to fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "these include parameters that define the background cosmology ( such as the geometry and matter content ) and parameters that define the nature of irregularities in the early universe ( such as the amplitude and shape of the fluctuation spectrum ) .",
    "early attempts to constrain the parameters of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models were made by bond &  efstathiou ( 1984 ) and vittorio &  silk ( 1984 ) .",
    "more recently , the parameters of cdm - type models have been constrained using the @xmath1dmr data alone ( e.g. bennett 1996 , bunn , scott &  white 1995 , stompor , grski &  banday 1995 , grski 1998 ) , and @xmath1 combined with degree - scale measurements of cmb anisotropies ( e.g. hancock 1997 , lineweaver 1997 , bond & jaffe 1997 ) .    in the near future ,",
    "long - duration balloon flights and satellite experiments promise to provide a wealth of high quality data on the cmb anisotropies .",
    "this has stimulated a number of theoretical investigations on the determination of cosmological parameters from observations of the cmb anisotropies ( jungman 1996 , bersanelli 1996 , bond , 1997 , zaldarriaga 1997 , efstathiou &  bond 1998 , eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1998 ) .",
    "these studies have confirmed that many cosmological parameters , or combinations of parameters , can be determined by future satellite missions to unprecedented precisions of a few percent or better .",
    "however , these studies have identified some degeneracies between sets of cosmological parameters estimated from the linear cmb power spectra alone .",
    "since the entire statistical information on the cmb anisotropies in gaussian theories is contained in the power spectrum , such parameter degeneracies impose serious limitations on the ability of cmb experiments to constrain cosmological parameters without invoking additional external constraints .    in particular , bond ( 1997 ) and zaldarriaga ( 1997 )",
    "have emphasized that cosmological models with identical fluctuation spectra , matter content and angular diameter distance to the scattering surface ( see section 2.1 below ) will produce statistically almost indistinguishable power spectra of cmb fluctuations .",
    "this property ( which we call the _ geometrical degeneracy _",
    "hereafter ) means that in the limit of validity of linear perturbation theory , cmb measurements can not set strong independent bounds on the spatial curvature and cosmological constant and hence can not unambiguously constrain the spatial geometry of the universe .",
    "in fact there are many additional observational constraints that can be used to break the geometrical degeneracy .",
    "examples include accurate measurements of the hubble constant , the age of the universe and the geometrical constraints imposed by type ia supernovae light curves [ see figure [ fig1 ] and the more detailed discussions by white ( 1998 ) , tegmark , eisenstein &  hu ( 1998 ) and efstathiou &  bond ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "however , before invoking more conventional astronomical observations , it is worthwhile analysing whether there are non - linear contributions to the cmb anisotropies that can break the geometrical degeneracy .",
    "if such effects are present , then it may be possible to break the geometrical degeneracy using measurements of the cmb alone . in this paper , we analyse the effect of gravitational lensing on the cmb anisotropies .",
    "although acknowledged to be small ( blanchard &  schneider 1987 , cole &  efstathiou 1989 , sasaki 1989 , seljak 1996 ) , the gravitational lensing effect may be detectable by the high precision observations of the cmb anisotropies expected from future satellite experiments .",
    "the possibility of utilising gravitational lensing to break the geometrical degeneracy has been noticed independently by metcalf &  silk ( 1998 ) . in this paper , we analyse the effects of gravitational lensing on the temperature , polarisation and temperature - polarisation cross - correlation power spectra and assess whether it is possible to observe these effects with the map ( bennett 1997 ) and planck ( bersanelli 1996 ) satellites .",
    "in this paper we restrict ourselves to cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies with adiabatic scalar perturbations , an arbitrary value of the curvature ( @xmath2 ) and cosmological constant ( @xmath3 ) . following bond ( 1997 )",
    "we use physical densities , @xmath4 , to define the matter content of the universe , in units of @xmath5 . ] with @xmath6,b , c,@xmath7,@xmath8 , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11,@xmath8 are the density parameters of baryons , cold dark matter ( cdm ) , photons etc .",
    "we assume the standard thermal history throughout this paper with recombination at redshift @xmath12 ( peebles 1968 ) and ignore the possibility of reionization . in the numerical examples described below ,",
    "we have assumed a scale - invariant ( harrison - zeldovich ) power spectrum of primordial scalar and adiabatic fluctuations @xmath13 where a wavenumber @xmath14 is the separation constant of the helmholtz equation ( e.g. harrisson 1967 ) .",
    "as is well known , the power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies in such models displays prominent ` doppler ' peaks ( see , figures 2a , b ) .",
    "the shape of the cmb power spectrum and , in particular , the locations and relative heights of the peaks , depend sensitively on cosmological parameters ( e.g. hu &  sugiyama 1995 ) . the doppler peak structure is imprinted into the present day cmb power spectrum at the time of recombination .",
    "since recombination occurs at a high redshift , no plausible value of the cosmological constant or spatial curvature can influences the dynamical evolution of the universe at that time .",
    "the statistical properties of the cmb anisotropies at the time of last scattering are therefore determined by the form of the initial fluctuations spectrum ( mode , shape and amplitude ) and by the physical densities that determine the sound speed prior to recombination .",
    "after last scattering , ( assuming that the universe remains neutral ) the only mechanism that can affect a freely - falling cmb photon is the gravitational interaction with the evolving matter field . in the linear approximation this is sometimes called the integrated sachs - wolfe effect [ see , e.g. the review by bond ( 1996 ) ] and is of importance only for temperature fluctuations on the largest angular scales .",
    "since the large - scale anisotropies have large statistical uncertainties ( cosmic variance ) , the integrated sachs - wolfe effect can not break the geometrical degeneracy except for extreme values of the cosmological parameters [ see efstathiou &  bond ( 1998 ) for detailed calculations ] . in linear theory ,",
    "the geometrical degeneracy can be assumed to be exact for most practical purposes .",
    "two models will have statistically indistinguishable temperature , polarisation and cross - correlation linear power spectra as a result of the geometrical degeneracy if they have :    \\(i ) identical matter content of those components that determine the sound speed at recombination , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , ... ;    \\(ii ) identical comoving distance to the last scattering surface ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 , % \\nonumber \\label{rlss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath19 ( bond 1997 ) . in equation ( [ rlss ] ) we have assumed an open universe ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the upper limit in ( [ rlss ] ) is the value of the scale factor @xmath21 at the present epoch and the lower limit is the value at the time of the last scattering [ for which we use the fitting formula of hu &  white ( 1997 ) ] ;    \\(iii ) identical fluctuation spectra normalised to have the same amplitudes at the time of recombination .",
    "if the above conditions are satisfied , the cmb power spectra of the two models will be indistinguishable on small angular scales , but will differ at large angles because of geometrical effects on near curvature scales and , in the case of temperature anisotropies , through the integrated sachs - wolfe effect . however , these effects are weak discriminators of models . in the analysis that follows , when we compare two models , we normalise them so that the root mean square mass deviation computed within a top hat window of radius @xmath22mpc [ denoted hereafter @xmath23 is the same _ at the time of last scattering _ ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this prescription determines the relative normalisations of any two models that we wish to compare , but does not determine the absolute normalisation .",
    "the effects of gravitational lensing depend , of course , on the absolute normalisation of the matter fluctuations .",
    "we therefore normalise a given target model so that the rms mass fluctuations within a sphere of @xmath25mpc at the present day ( @xmath26 ) reproduces the abundances of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "we therefore impose the constraint , @xmath27 from the recent analysis of eke , cole &  frenk ( 1996 ) .",
    "the normalisation of scale - invariant models derived from ( [ cluster ] ) is usually lower than that inferred from the 4 year cobe - dmr data ( e.g. grski 1998 ) .",
    "however , equation ( [ cluster ] ) provides a more direct measure of the amplitude of the mass fluctuations which generate gravitational lensing effects at recent epochs .",
    "we give the @xmath28 uncertainty in equation ( [ cluster ] ) , though this is sufficiently small that it has no significant effect on results described below .",
    "some authors , e.g. viana &  liddle ( 1996 ) deduce slightly larger values of @xmath29 for low density models , in which case our analysis will underestimate the effects of gravitational lensing on the cmb .    in summary ,",
    "we pick a specific set of cosmological parameters to define a target model and we use equation ( [ cluster ] ) to set the absolute normalisation of the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "when we compare models with a different set of cosmological parameters , we choose a normalisation so that the fluctuation spectra have the same amplitude at the time of recombination , so preserving the geometrical degeneracy .",
    "these points are illustrated in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2a ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows degenerate loci in the @xmath30 , @xmath31 plane ( @xmath32 ) for models with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "figures 2a , b show the linear cmb power spectra for two sets of models satisfying the geometrical degeneracy plotted as filled circles in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "these have been computed using a version of the cmbfast code developed by seljak &  zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) which we have modified to gain an improvement in accuracy ( see section 4.2 ) .",
    "clearly , the spectra for each set of models are almost indistinguishable .",
    "the only significant deviations are at low multipoles ( @xmath35 ) and are a consequence of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect described above .",
    "in fact , the numerically computed spectra in figures 2a , b also show some residual differences at high @xmath36 ( illustrated by the dashed line in the middle panels of figure 2a , b )",
    ". however , these differences are dominated by residual numerical inaccuracies in cmbfast ( see the discussion in section 4.2 ) . for models with reasonable normalisations [ reproducing cluster abundances as inferred from equation ( [ cluster ] ) ] these numerical errors are much smaller than differences arising from gravitational lensing .      if we keep all of the parameters of a target model fixed but vary @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the geometrical degeneracy will be satisfied if @xmath37 where the subscript @xmath38 on any quantity denotes that it is computed assuming the parameters of the target model .",
    "we can define two new parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41\\equiv \\l [ \\begin{array}{c c } \\displaystyle{\\cos\\phi }   & \\displaystyle{\\sin\\phi}\\\\ \\displaystyle{-\\sin\\phi } & \\displaystyle{\\cos\\phi } \\end{array } \\r ] \\l [ \\begin{array}{c } \\displaystyle{\\delta\\omega_k } % \\medskip \\\\ % \\medskip \\displaystyle{\\delta\\omega_\\lambda } \\end{array } \\r ] , \\label{newpars}\\ ] ] where @xmath42}$ ] is the angle between a degenerate curve plotted in figure [ fig1 ] and the @xmath30 axis .",
    "models satisfying @xmath43 thus have the same value of @xmath17 for small variations of parameters and therefore satisfy the geometrical degeneracy .",
    "hereafter we call any direction with @xmath43 a degeneracy direction .",
    "if the geometrical degeneracy were perfect , the derivative of the cmb power spectrum along a degeneracy direction should be exactly equal to zero .",
    "the numerical derivatives of linear power spectra are discussed in section 4.2 ( see also efstathiou &  bond 1998 ) and shown in figures 4 &  8 .",
    "the gravitational lensing contribution to the temperature power spectra has been computed in the past by several authors ( e.g. blanchard &  schneider 1987 , cole &  efstathiou 1989 , sasaki 1989 , seljak 1996 , martnez - gonzlez , sanz &  cayn 1997 , zaldarriaga &  seljak 1998 ) . here",
    "we follow the approach of seljak ( 1996 ) and zaldarriaga & seljak ( 1998 ) .",
    "we denote the linear power spectra as @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 for temperature , polarisation ( e - component only ) and their cross - correlation respectively .",

    "the gravitational lensing correction to the cmb anisotropies depends on the full matter power spectrum , including non - linear contributions from small spatial scales .",
    "previous calculations ( e.g. cole & efstathiou 1989 , seljak 1996 , zaldarriaga &  seljak 1998 ) have suggested that the contribution of non - linear modes introduces only minor corrections to the gravitational lensing contribution computed using the linear form of the matter power spectrum . to check whether non - linear evolution affects our analysis",

    "there is , however , a possibility that the lensing contributions to the cmb anisotropies can be mimicked by variations in other cosmological parameters thereby defining a new degeneracy direction .",
    "it is unlikely that such a degeneracy would be perfect , but it is possible that the the total power spectra including lensing corrections are partially degenerate with respect to variations of other parameters , limiting their usefulness as a diagnostic of the geometry of the universe . to examine this possibility",
    "we have therefore computed the fisher matrix for a more realistic six parameter space defined by the following cosmological parameters : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath94 , @xmath15 , the scalar spectral index @xmath95 and the amplitude @xmath96 of the mass fluctuations at the time of recombination .",
    "we have explicitly ignored a tensor component since any tensor component would have a negligible amplitude at the high multipoles at which gravitational lensing of the cmb is significant .",
    "the results of the fisher matrix analysis for a planck - type experiment are listed in table [ multidim ] .",
    "the errors on @xmath31 and @xmath30 for the standard cdm model in the six parameter example are usually larger than those of the idealized two parameter example described in the previous subsection .",
    "for example for models @xmath97",
    "( @xmath98-dominated , spatially flat universe ) and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 , open universe ) , the errors on @xmath31 and @xmath30 in the six - dimensional case are about @xmath101 times those derived for the two - dimensional case .",
    "however , no new near - degeneracy is found suggesting that it is feasible to separate the geometrical dependence of the lensing contributions of the cmb power spectra from the changes caused by varying other cosmological parameters .",
    "observations of the cmb anisotropies promise a dramatic improvement in our knowledge of the formation of cosmic structure and of the values of fundamental cosmological parameters that define our universe . according to linear perturbation theory , however",
    ", there exists a near exact geometrical degeneracy that makes it nearly impossible to disentangle the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 from observations of the cmb anisotropies alone . in reality",
    ", the cmb temperature and polarisation anisotropies will be modified by gravitational lensing caused by the irregular distribution of matter between us and the last scattering surface .",
    "the effects of gravitational lensing , although small , might be detectable by the planck satellite for reasonable values of the amplitude of the present day mass fluctuations ( values that reproduce the present day abundance of rich clusters of galaxies ) .    in this paper , we have computed the effects of gravitational lensing on both the temperature and polarisation pattern and demonstrated that lensing can break the geometrical degeneracy inherent in the linear cmb power spectra .",
    "we have performed a fisher matrix analysis to show how gravitational lensing affects estimates of cosmological parameters .",
    "the fisher matrix requires derivatives of the cmb power spectra with respect to the cosmological parameters . since numerical errors in these derivatives",
    "can artificially break real parameter degeneracies , we have made a detailed analysis of numerical errors in our computations and shown that they are small .",
    "the results of our fisher matrix analysis are summarized in tables 3 &  4 for an idealized two dimensional space of @xmath31 and @xmath30 and for a more realistic space of six cosmological parameters .",
    "these show that gravitational lensing is detectable by a planck - type experiment and must be taken into account when estimating the values of cosmological parameters .",
    "the effects of gravitational lensing are detectable in both the temperature and polarisation anisotropies .",
    "for some experimental parameters , the effects of lensing are more easily detectable in the polarisation signal ( because of the sharpness of the peaks and minima in the polarisation power spectrum ) than in the temperature power spectrum , even though the anisotropies are polarised at only the few percent level .",
    "gravitational lensing of the cmb anisotropies breaks the geometrical degeneracy and so it should be possible to set limits on the values of @xmath31 and @xmath30 from observations of the cmb anisotropies alone .",
    "for example , from the 6 parameter analysis in table 4 for model 1a ( a spatially flat @xmath98-dominated universe ) it should be possible to set @xmath28 limits of @xmath104 and @xmath105 using temperature and polarisation measurements and limits of @xmath106 and @xmath107 from observations of temperature anisotropies alone .",
    "this shows that for certain target models a planck - type experiment is capable of setting tight limits on the geometry of the universe .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of detecting gravitational lensing adds to the scientific case for measuring cmb polarisation at high sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "the lensing constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath30 are sensitive to the normalisation of the present day mass fluctuations and the growth rate of the matter fluctuations hence we find less stringent limits for a standard cdm model normalised to @xmath108 ( tables 3 and 4 ) .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case , a planck - like experiment can set @xmath109 errors of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the geometrical degeneracy can be broken by applying constraints derived from more conventional astronomical techniques .",
    "for example , accurate measurements of the hubble constant , age of the universe , the luminosity distances of type 1a supernovae , measurements of large - scale galaxy clustering can be used , with various assumptions , to break the geometrical degeneracy ( see efstathiou &  bond 1998 ) . however , as described in this paper , gravitational lensing breaks the geometrical degeneracy and so one can disentangle the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 from accurate observations of the cmb anisotropies .",
    "comparison of results of cmb - based experiments with those obtained with more conventional techniques can provide consistency checks and tests of possible systematic errors .",

    "<S> gravitational lensing , caused by matter perturbations along the line - of - sight to the last scattering surface , can modify the shape of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the detectability of lensing distortions to the temperature , polarisation and temperature - polarisation cross - correlation power spectra and we analyse how lensing might affect the estimation of cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for cold dark matter - like models with present - day matter power spectra normalised to match the abundances of rich clusters of galaxies , gravitational lensing causes detectable distortions to cosmic variance limited cmb experiments sampling high multipoles ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational lensing of the cmb , although a small effect , allows independent determinations of the curvature of the universe and the cosmological constant , breaking the so - called _ geometrical degeneracy _ in cmb parameter estimation discussed by bond , efstathiou &  tegmark ( 1997 ) and zaldarriaga , spergel &  seljak ( 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> gravitational lensing of the cmb temperature and polarisation patterns should be detectable by the planck surveyor satellite leading to useful independent constraints on the cosmological constant and spatial curvature .    </S>",
