    "this approach enables us to define a ( co)homology theory for biracks with a fully combinatorial formula for the boundary map , which we are able to employ to identify the degenerate subcomplex associated to @xmath0-phone cord moves for arbitrary biracks of finite characteristic , generalizing the previous cases of quandle , @xmath0-reduced rack , and yang - baxter ( co)homology . as an application we use @xmath0-reduced augmented birack 2-cocycles to define cocycle enhancements of the birack counting invariant .",

    "@xmath6 the names are chosen so that if we orient a crossing , positive or negative , with the strands oriented upward , then the unbarred actions go left - to - right and the barred actions go right - to - left , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 standing for `` above '' and `` below '' .",
    "thus , @xmath9 is the result of @xmath10 going above @xmath11 left - to - right and @xmath12 is the result of @xmath11 going below @xmath10 from right - to - left .",
