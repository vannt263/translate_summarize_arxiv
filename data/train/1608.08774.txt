    "the composition of cometary nuclei ( mainly ices , silicate dust and organics ) is known primarily from observations of their comae @xcite .",
    "the structure of a cometary coma is often expressed in terms of a uniform , spherically - symmetric outflow .",
    "the volatile species are either parent species , sublimated directly from the nucleus , or daughter species , produced in the coma @xcite .",
    "the picture is complicated by chemical processes , temporal evolution and the sublimation of icy aggregates . in situ spacecraft observations of several comets",
    "have allowed their nuclei to be imaged and the gas and dust properties of their coma to be studied in great detail .",
    "more specifically , the sublimation of icy grains has been detected in the ejecta of comet 9p / tempel 1 after the impact with the deep impact spacecraft @xcite and in the coma of comet 103p / hartley 2 during the deep impact extended investigation ( dixi ) @xcite . + since its discovery in 1969 , comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ( 67p ) has been observed from ground - based observatories during its 7 apparitions . from 2008 - 2009 ,",
    "i.e. during its last perihelion , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite monitored a highly anisotropic outgassing where many jets were detected .",
    "the esa ( european space agency ) rosetta spacecraft was launched on march 2 , 2004 , to reach comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ( 67p ) . since march 2014 , images of the nucleus and the coma ( gas and dust ) of the comet have been acquired by the osiris ( optical , spectroscopic , and infrared remote imaging system ) camera system @xcite using both the wide angle camera ( wac ) and the narrow angle camera ( nac ) .",
    "the orbiter is expected to remain in close proximity to the nucleus of the comet until post - perihelion in september 2016 . to date , more than 2 years of continuous , close - up observations of the gas and dust coma have been obtained and have helped to characterize the evolution of comet gas and dust activity ( outgassing effect ) during the approach to the sun . for the first time , we were able to follow the development of a comet s coma from a close distance , and we were able study the dust - gas interaction searching for indications of ongoing sublimation of icy aggregates .",
    "many studies have shown evidence of sublimation on 67p @xcite + from july 2014 onwards , the morphology , the location and the temporal variation of the comet s jets have been observed with the osiris cameras .",
    "@xcite analyzed three osiris data sets in july and august 2014 and found active regions in hapi , hathor , anuket , and aten ( highly spatially resolved ) .",
    "the nucleus map ( shown in figure [ map_thomas ] ) which indicated the regions , was taken from @xcite .",
    "@xcite further studied osiris sequences between august and september 2014 . during the two months of observations , the cometary distance ranged from 98.7 to 106.1 km and the spatial resolution of the nucleus and",
    "the jets was high ( < 10 m @xmath8 ) .",
    "these jets ( mostly originating from the hapi region ) did not appear to be associated with specific morphologies but followed insolation @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( may to august 2015 ) and @xcite ( august 2014 to may 2015 ) showed that the jets appeared to rotate with the nucleus and followed the solar illumination . over the above period ( july 2014 to august 2015 ) , the comet passed from northern summer to southern summer with the equinox on may 10 2015 .",
    "@xcite noted that some jets observed in the northern summer on 67p appeared to be morphology - dependent .",
    "+        the present work analyzes if the sublimation of icy aggregates would explain the brightness profile of the jets observed with the osiris data .",
    "we analyze the observations acquired at the end of may 2015 with the wac very shortly after the southern vernal equinox .",
    "we study the brightness distribution of the jets ( @xmath9 [ w @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 ) as a function of the distance from the nucleus ( @xmath13 [ km ] ) .",
    "first , we present the observations obtained with the osiris cameras .",
    "we describe the method we used to obtain the photometric profile of the dust jet from the wac images .",
    "the temporal variation of the jet after one rotation of the nucleus is studied and the location of the jet is determined .",
    "additionally , we describe the model of sublimation of icy aggregates which is adapted from the model of sublimation described in @xcite .",
    "we follow the evolution of aggregates once they are ejected into the coma until they sublimate completely .",
    "given an aggregate velocity , we determine at which radial distance from the nucleus the sublimation occurs . finally , we compare the measured radial profile of the jet with the synthetic radial profile of the sublimating icy aggregates .",
    "the osiris cameras , composed of the wac and nac , were dedicated to mapping the nucleus of comet 67p and to characterizing the evolution of the comet s gas and dust @xcite .",
    "the wac ( 230 - 750 nm ) was principally used to study the coma of dust and gas , while the nac ( 250 - 1000 nm ) was mainly used to investigate the structure of the nucleus .",
    "we typically monitored activity of gas and dust with the wac approximately once every two weeks at heliocentric distances greater than 2 au and once per week afterward .",
    "the nominal sequence for these observations had a set of observations once per hour for a full comet rotation @xcite .",
    "the rotation period of the nucleus decreased by 0.36h during its last perihelion @xcite .",
    "as both rosetta and the comet approached earth , the data volume available increased , and we updated the observational sequence to one set of observations every 20 min , for 14h .",
    "this provided coverage of the diurnal and seasonal evolution of the coma .",
    "+ rosetta started to observe 67p , during the long northern summer , while the southern hemisphere was almost in total darkness . in march 2015 , as the equinox ( 10 may 2015 ) was approaching , we started to observe new regions becoming active close to the equator in the nut , serqet , maat and imhotep regions @xcite .",
    "these regions , shown in figure [ map_thomas ] , had been in darkness , so we expected the release of fresh material during the equinox , because sublimation is strongly correlated with the local insolation @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to section [ jet_location ] for a further explanation of the source location of the jet ( imhotep region ) , but we point out here that we chose to analyze a jet for which the latitude of the base of the jet was almost identical to the sub - solar latitude , i.e. , the sun passes directly overhead at noon .",
    "thus the base of the jet receives the maximum duration of sunlight in simple geometries and in this case the geometry allowed the jet - base to be illuminated for a long time each day .",
    "therefore , we chose the dust monitoring observations on may 30 and 31 , 2015 utilizing the wac ( mtp016/stp058 dust mon 005 ) to compare with our model . + we began by analyzing data from a sequence covering 16h , from ut 15:43:38 , may 30th 2015 until ut 07:28:22 , may 31st 2015 .",
    "we exclude data taken during the night time ( darkness ) at the source of the jet . only images taken when the big lobe is illuminated , i.e. , when the parts of imhotep that are in the southern hemisphere were illuminated , were used ( 11 images ; figure [ image_jet_coma ] ) . on may 30 , 2015 the time interval was 30 min .",
    "we did not consider images between ut 20:55:13 may 30th 2015 and ut 3:46:49 may 31st 2015 because the base of the jet was in darkness . on may 31 , 2015 the time interval between images was 30 min for the images between ut 04:16:49 - 04:46:49 and ut 06:58:22 - ut 07:28:22 , separated by a 2h interval without observations .",
    "the image ids and the relevant circumstances are listed in table [ obs_visible ] . for all images",
    "the heliocentric distance is 1.53 au , and the resolution is 1.01 @xmath3 @xmath14 rad @xmath8 . for @xmath15 around 200 km , the wac field of view is ( fov ) = 40 @xmath3 40 km .",
    "no binning was used in collecting or downlinking the images .",
    "the dust monitoring sequence includes multiple filters , but we use primarily images taken with a narrow - band filter in the red ( visible ) , designed to minimize any gaseous emission lines ( center wavelength = @xmath16 = 610 nm , fwhm = 9.45 nm ) .",
    "it provides a better signal to noise than images in a filter for the near - ultraviolet ( 375 nm , uv ) .",
    "the red continuum filter was usually used to obtain both a short and a long exposure time , of which we use the longer exposure time , 6.2 sec .",
    "+    .the osiris dust monitoring campaign - wac images - visible filter ( f18 ) .",
    "only images when the south hemisphere is illuminated are taken into account .",

    "we used wac images from the osiris cameras with the visible filter shortly after the southern vernal equinox on may 30 and 31 , 2015 at @xmath0 = 1.53 au ( table [ obs_visible ] ) , as explained in section [ obs_section ] .",
    "we studied the temporal variation of the brightness of the jet and the background coma and found that the jet rotates with the nucleus ( figure [ image_jet_coma ] ) .",
    "the key result of this work is the determination of the brightness slopes of the jet ( 1.31 @xmath17 0.17 ) which is much steeper than that of the background coma ( 0.74 @xmath17 0.06 ) , as determined in section [ rad_pro ] ( figure [ vis_jet_coma ] ) .",
    "this is a first indication of sublimation as also suggested by @xcite with miro . from osiris observations at @xmath0 = 3.5 au ( from august to september 2014 )",
    ", @xcite found similar results for both the slope for the background and for the jet .",
    "even if the heliocentric distance is different , the similar results between these studies are remarkable .",
    "nonetheless , more data analysis on the osiris images has to be done to fully understand the composition and morphology of the jets .",
    "furthermore , the slope we derived for the background coma was consistent with results from various instruments on comet 67p @xcite and 103p / hartley 2 @xcite .",
    "+ we determined , in section [ jet_location ] , that the jet arose from the eastern side of the imhotep region .",
    "the source of the jet we are studying was at the boundary between the smooth edge of the imhotep plains and rougher terrains where evidence of water ice on the surface havd been found ( section [ jet_location ] , figure [ imhotep_jet ] ) .",
    "bright features in the imhotep region , which might be indicative of ice and water ice in particular @xcite , have been detected on the imhotep region with osiris @xcite , and virtis @xcite .",
    "the bluer regions looked exceptionally active with jets @xcite or outbursts rising from the bright patches .",
    "all these studies confirmed the presence of water ice on the surface and subsurface of comet 67p ( and probably indicated a mixture of ice and dust ) .",
    "+ in section [ model_subli ] , we described an updated model of sublimation of icy aggregates @xcite .",
    "as explained in the present paper , even if the temperature of the aggregates with a dirt contamination was similar ( figure [ temperature ] ) , the amount of ice played an important role in the lifetime of the aggregates of icy grains and at which distance from the nucleus the sublimation occured .",
    "table [ compo ] , in section [ model_parameter ] , allowed us to constrain both the composition ( dirty grains ) and the size ( radius 5@xmath6 m - 50@xmath6 m ) of the icy aggregates . in the study of the jet , observed near the southern vernal equinox on may 2015 , we supposed a length scale of the jet around 10 km @xcite .",
    "the jet brightness is below the background noise after 10 km . in section [ model_comparaison ]",
    ", we compared the model with the osiris images . the major result of this article",
    "is that by sublimation of the aggregates of dirty grains , we can explain the decline beyond 4 km from the nucleus in the radial brightness profile of a jet ( section [ model_comparaison ] , figure [ method_plot ] ) .",
    "however , other intimate mixtures with different radii might be able to reproduce the curve of the radial brightness of the jet . to reproduce the data we needed @xmath18 between 8.5 @xmath3 @xmath4 and 8.5 @xmath3 @xmath5 for a = 5@xmath6 m and 50@xmath6 m respectively , or an initial mass of @xmath7 ice around 22 kg ( table [ size_nb ] ) .",
    "our total number of aggregates of radius 50 micron is in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite proposed a nomenclature of mechanisms for producing jets .",
    "his type i jet appeared to be related to the sublimation of water with the release of dust due to the sublimation of icy grains below the surface .",
    "the cosima instrument , aimed to collect comet particles @xcite they reported both the detections of particles with a radius @xmath19 50@xmath6 m and a porosity much higher that the porosity of the nucleus at @xmath0 = 3.57 au @xcite .",
    "although no ice was detected , it could indicate that the ice component already sublimated before the cosima images were taken .",
    "if the ice was below the surface , we needed efficient gas drag to remove the dust which covered the surface for many years .",
    "however , closer to the sun the volatiles underneath the dust layers could lift the overlying dust .",
    "our work showed that coordination of rosetta data , ground - based observations and numerical models will help to have a better understanding of the jet s activity .",
    "however , the mechanisms creating the jets is complex and will need further analysis .",
    "furthermore , we need to compare the radial profile of jets from others regions of the nucleus with our model to have a better understanding of the structure and composition of the nucleus . +",
