    "in the theory of atomic structure due to thomas and fermi @xcite integrals arise @xcite which contain the airy function @xmath0 and its derivative @xmath1 @xcite@xmath2  a typical example of these integrals being@xmath3\\,dx,\\]]where @xmath4 is given by @xmath5the value of the integral ( to 8 figures ) obtained by numerical methods is -0.26363171 .",
    "however , it would be useful and within the spirit of thomas fermi ( tf ) theory if an exact or at least an analytic expression for this integral and others like it could be obtained .  with this in mind",
    ", this paper presents methods which attempt to move towards that goal .  in anticipation of the work which follows we set@xmath6and rewrite the integral above as @xmath7integration by parts gives @xmath8\\,x(z)\\,dz .",

    "the derivatives within @xmath13 can in turn be given by the fa di bruno formula for the ( k-1)@xmath19 derivative of a composite function @xcite as expressed in terms of the incomplete bell polynomials @xmath20 @xcite i.e.@xmath21 _ { x=0}b_{k-1,\\,p}(u^{(1)}(0),u^{(2)}(0),\\ldots , u^{(k - p)}(0)),\\]]where @xmath22 _ { x=0}.\\]]the expression for @xmath13 can be quickly reduced to terms involving the gamma function @xmath23 @xcite to get @xmath24the derivatives of the function @xmath25 can easily be obtained since the power series for @xmath1 is well known @xcite i.e.@xmath26using the latter expression we get @xmath27 \\,{\\small 3}% ^{i\\,/3}\\,\\tfrac{\\gamma ( \\frac{i+1}{3})\\sin ( \\frac{2}{3}[i+1]\\pi ) } { ( i+2)}.\\end{aligned}\\]]finally the integral is given by@xmath28 } { ( k+2)(k+4)}s_{k } ,   \\label{eq3}\\]]where @xmath29 is defined as@xmath30and the reduced quantities @xmath31 are given by      in obtaining the expression in ( 3,4 ) we have used the homogeneous scaling properties @xcite of the incomplete bell polynomials i.e.@xmath33to rewrite the bell polynomials in terms of the reduced quantities @xmath34      the infinite sum representation for the integral @xmath16 in ( 3 ) is a slowly varying function of @xmath35 .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath16 given by a partial sum containing the first ten terms is only 91 % of the value obtained bynumerical evaluation of the integral .",
    "although a complete analysis ( or estimate ) of the convergence behavior of this sum does not appear to be possible , it is likely that ( 3 ) is an asymptotic series representation of the integral @xmath16 .",
    "nevertheless , in an attempt to increase the rate of convergence i.e. accelerate the assumed convergence of the sum , we note that the magnitudes ( figure 1 ) of the summands @xmath36@xmath37 } { % ( k+2)(k+4)}s_{k},\\]]in ( 3 ) are small for values of @xmath35 greater than 10 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath29 is plotted ( figure 2 ) versus @xmath35 for values of @xmath38 it can be seen to vary like powers of @xmath39 i.e.@xmath40where regression analysis yields @xmath41 = 0.751653834 , @xmath42 = 2.25325549 , @xmath43 = -6.815672901 .      using the curve fitted expression for @xmath29 the expression for @xmath16 becomes@xmath44 } { ( k+2)(k+4)}s_{k}+i_{remainder},\\]]where @xmath45 } { % k\\;(k+2)\\;(k+4)}\\right\\ } + b\\left\\ { \\sigma _ { 2}-\\sum_{k=1}^{10}\\tfrac{\\left [ \\psi ( 3)\\,-\\,\\psi ( k/2 + 3)\\right ] } { k^{2}\\;(k+2)\\;(k+4)}\\right\\ }   \\label{eq5 } \\\\ & & + c\\left\\ { \\sigma _ { 3}-\\sum_{k=1}^{10}\\tfrac{\\left [ \\psi ( 3)\\,-\\,\\psi ( k/2 + 3)\\right ] } { k^{3}\\;(k+2)\\;(k+4)}\\right\\ } { \\large ] } .",
