    "the mass parameter of the higgs field in the standard model ( @xmath4 ) gives the appearance of being ",
    "anthropically tuned \" @xcite . that is ,",
    "if one imagines the other parameters of the standard model to be fixed , and considers what the universe would look like for different values of @xmath4 , one finds that organic life may only be possible if @xmath4 is negative and has a magnitude very close to the value actually observed . from the physics point of view",
    "this might be just a coincidence , though a remarkable one .",
    "on the other hand , as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , it might have a physical explanation in the context of  many - domain \" ,  multiverse \" ,  landscape \" scenarios .",
    "( these are equivalent names for the same idea . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite . ) an explanation of that sort would account for the closeness of the strong - interaction and weak - interaction scales ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , something not yet explained by any other scenario .",
    "( the nearness of the weak - scale to the strong scale results in the lightest quarks having masses small compared to @xmath7 , which in turn leads to the existence of nonperturbative bound states of quarks , pseudogoldstone pions , and the the richness of hadronic and nuclear physics , and consequently of chemistry . )    in this paper we extend the analysis of @xcite to a slightly more general higgs structure and show that a possible anthropic explanation of the fact that @xmath8 emerges .",
    "we also reconsider the crucial case of positive @xmath4 , and point out that one of the anthropic arguments proposed in @xcite to exclude most of the @xmath9 region is invalidated by the existence of dark energy ( which had not yet been discovered when @xcite was written ) .",
    "however , we show that the existence of dark energy makes possible a very different set of arguments that reach even stronger conclusions .    the papers of ref",
    ". 1 assumed that the only parameter of the standard model that varies among domains and is anthropically tuned is @xmath4 .",
    "several facts suggest the possibility that the observed value of @xmath4 may be acounted for in a different way than the values of the other parameters of the standard model .",
    "first , @xmath4 is the only dimensionful parameter of the standard model lagrangian .",
    "second , it is the most highly tuned of the standard model parameters , being @xmath10 of its  natural \" value .",
    "( the next most tuned parameter is @xmath11 , which is less than @xmath12 of its natural value . )",
    "third , the smallness of @xmath4 is so far the most intractable of the naturalness problems of the standard model .",
    "various plausible mechanisms of a more conventional sort have been proposed for explaining the smallness of other standard model parameters .",
    "( for example , the smallness of @xmath11 can be explained by the peccei - quinn mechanism @xcite or by spontaneously broken cp or p @xcite ; and various symmetry schemes have been proposed to explain the smallness of the yukawa couplings of the light quarks and leptons ) . by contrast",
    ", attempts to explain the smallness of the weak scale by technicolor or similar ideas are plagued by a variety of well - known difficulties . and",
    "low energy supersymmetry does not by itself explain the magnitude of the weak scale , though it protects it from radiative correction .    since the focus of ref .",
    "1 was on the mass parameter of the higgs field , the question naturally arises how things would be different if there were two or more higgs doublets .",
    "two higgs doublets appear in a wide variety of theoretical contexts : in theories with supersymmetry ; in peccei - quinn models ; and in many grand unified models ( such as @xmath13 , if the @xmath14 of higgs fields is assumed to be complex ) .",
    "the simplest possibility , which is typical of the above - mentioned scenarios , and which avoids problems of higgs - mediated flavor - changing processes , is that one doublet ( @xmath15 ) couples to the up - type quarks , while the other doublet ( @xmath16 ) couples to the down - type quarks and charged leptons @xcite .",
    "it is this situation we will analyze in this paper .",
    "thus , at high scales we have    @xmath17    with two higgs doublets , there are several dimensionful higgs - mass parameters that may vary among domains , with the consequence that @xmath18 and @xmath19 may vary independently .",
    "this means that there is the possibility of explaining not only the magnitude of the weak scale , but also the relative magnitudes of the masses of the up - type and down - type quarks .",
    "in particular , we shall see that an explanation of the size of @xmath20 and thus a partial explanation of @xmath21 emerges .",
    "much of our analysis would apply equally to models with or without low - energy supersymmetry , and would apply in fact to any model where in effect both @xmath22 and @xmath23 vary among domains .",
    "thus , the  anthropic \" considerations given in this paper are not proposed as an alternative to low - energy supersymmetry . indeed",
    ", they may shed light eventually on supersymmetry - breaking and the @xmath24 problem .",
    "however , in this paper we will consider for purposes of concreteness a non - supersymmetric two - higgs - doublet model .",
    "in such a model , the parameter @xmath4 is replaced by a two - by - two hermitian mass matrix @xmath25 , @xmath26 , with four real parameters . to make the weak - scale small , still only one tuning is required , namely of the determinant of @xmath25 , since only one higgs doublet needs to remain light to break @xmath27 .",
    "the other doublet has no reason to be light , and in fact would be expected to be of superlarge mass .",
    "the doublet that is light ( whose mass - squared we shall call @xmath4 ) is a linear combination of @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . the mixing angle @xmath30 enters into the relative magnitudes of the up - quark masses and down - quark masses .",
    "in particular , the ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 are proportional to @xmath31 . if @xmath25 varies in the landscape ( or  scans \" ) , then so does @xmath31 .",
    "we shall see that ",
    "anthropic \" considerations strongly favor the observation of values of @xmath20 that are of order ( but somewhat smaller than ) 1 and thus of values of @xmath21 much larger than 1 ( assuming , as we shall , that quark and lepton yukawa couplings are fixed , i.e. do not vary among domains ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that in published models or scenarios that do not invoke  anthropic \" or",
    " landscape \" considerations the relations @xmath8 and @xmath32 are generally not accounted for but are simply assumed to hold .",
    "( however , there have been a few attempts to explain @xmath33 in more conventional ways , such as @xcite . )",
    "it seems that anthropic and non - anthropic explanations are somewhat complementary : those relationships that seem most resistant to conventional dynamical or symmetry explanations ( which would include not only @xmath8 , but also @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are also those that are most straightforwardly accounted for  anthropically \" .    in this paper , as in ref . 1",
    ", we assume that the dimensionless parameters of the lagrangian are fixed , i.e. do not vary among domains .",
    "( more precisely , we assume that their values at some high scale are fixed , since their low - scale values will be slightly influenced through renormalization group running by the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . ) if this is assumed , then the inter - family ratios of yukawa couplings are known , e.g. the ratios of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "we will also assume that the yukawa couplings of the third family are all of order 1 .",
    "this is plausible , given that schemes that unify all the fermions of a family , such as @xmath13 , relate these three couplings ; and the simplest such schemes give @xmath40 .",
    "the relative values of the yukawa couplings of the up - type and down - type quarks are shown in a log plot in fig 1 .    .",
    "the up - type quarks have a much steeper family hierarchy .",
    "the scale on the left is @xmath41 . ]",
    "since the mass hierarchy among the up - type quarks is much steeper than that among the down - type quarks , normalizing @xmath42 implies that @xmath43 .",
    "that is ,    @xmath44    in the scenario we are discussing , the relative normalization of the up - type masses and down - type masses is free to  scan \" , i.e. vary among domains .",
    "the consequence of this , as we shall see , is that @xmath45 is anthropically selected to be close to but somewhat larger than 1 , and therefore @xmath21 ends up ( in anthropically viable domains ) being much larger than 1 , as shown in fig 2 .",
    "is anthropically set so @xmath8 , then @xmath46 due to the steeper hierarchy of the up - type quarks .",
    "the scale on the left is @xmath47 . ]",
    "it is in this sense that one can anthropically  explain \" the largeness of @xmath21 .",
    "of course , this assumes the pattern of interfamily mass ratios shown in fig 1 , i.e. the greater steepness of the hierarchy for up - type quarks than for down - type quarks .",
    "there exist many interesting and plausible theoretical schemes for explaining that pattern .",
    "one example is the model of @xcite , where the hierarchy among the up - type quarks is quadratic and the hierarchy among the down - type quarks is linear in the same small parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we shall call domains of the universe where organic life based on chemistry is possible  viable \" , and we shall call the values of parameters in such domains  anthropically allowed \" . in section 2 of this paper , we shall examine the consequences for  viability \" of different values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 and graphically display the anthropically allowed and forbidden regions of the @xmath50-@xmath51 plane . in section 3 , we shall look at the probability distributions of @xmath52 that arise from certain simple assumptions about the higgs mass matrix @xmath25 . in section 4",
    "we will use the probability distributions derived in section 3 to analyze the @xmath53 region of parameter space in light of the existence of dark energy and the anthropic requirement that it be fine - tuned to be small .",
    "in this section we will discuss anthropic constraints on @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "most of these constraints have been discussed in slightly different contexts in @xcite and @xcite , and much of the discussion in this section makes use of their results .",
    "the vacuum expectation @xmath55 that breaks the weak interactions and gives @xmath1 and @xmath0 their masses is that of the lighter higgs doublet @xmath56 , whose mass - squared parameter we are calling @xmath4 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath57 has a superlarge  natural \" scale @xmath58 , which is of order @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 , it does not matter for our analysis which ) .",
    "there are two qualitatively very different cases , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "smaller @xmath55 corresponds to more fine - tuning of @xmath64 . on the other hand , if @xmath62 , the breaking of the weak interactions is only induced by the coupling of @xmath56 to the quarks , which acquire condensates through the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry by qcd , so that @xmath65 . in this case , the natural scale of @xmath55 is @xmath66 , and _ larger _",
    "@xmath55 corresponds to more fine - tuning .",
    "one sees that the maximum and minimum values of @xmath55 are different by a factor of @xmath67 . in other words , if @xmath68 , @xmath55 can range over 60 orders of magnitude .",

    "4 is a blow - up of that region of parameter space .    since we are assuming that the yukawa couplings of the quarks and leptons do not vary among domains , and that both the down - type quarks and charged leptons get mass from the same higgs doublet @xmath16 , the electron mass is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a fixed ratio ( up to logarithmic dependence on @xmath22 and @xmath23 through the running of parameters ) .",

    "a very similar condition comes from requiring that the deuteron be stable against the weak decay @xmath122 , namely @xmath123 . in @xcite",
    "the binding energy of the deuteron was parameterized by    @xmath124    where energies are in mev and the parameter @xmath125 is very sensitive to the model of the internucleon potential . using two different models , @xcite obtained @xmath126 mev and @xmath127 mev . using eq . ( 3 ) , the condition for the deuteron to be stable against weak decay becomes @xmath128 . for @xmath126 mev ,",

    "it is possible that lepto / baryogenesis leads to asymmetries for @xmath0 , @xmath176 , and @xmath3 quarks that differ in sign .",

    ", the possibility of such exotic viable light-@xmath176-quark or light-@xmath136-quark domains would not affect the anthropic explanation of the observed values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 being explored in this paper .      in domains where @xmath62 the vacuum expectation value of @xmath210 is of order @xmath211 and therefore extremely small compared to its value in our domain .",
    "this means , of course , that in these domains the quark and lepton masses are correspondingly small .",
    "( for example , if @xmath212 and @xmath31 is the same as in our domain , then the electron mass is only about @xmath213 ev . )",
    "this has important consequences for life based on chemistry .",
    "the reason is that the energies of typical atomic and molecular transitions are of order , or smaller than , @xmath214 , and therefore so are the temperatures needed for biological processes to occur .",
    "( that is why in our domain the temperature needed for life is about 300 k @xmath215 . )",
    "it follows that before life based on chemistry can appear the universe has to have cooled down to a temperature much smaller than @xmath214 .    because @xmath216 is so small in positive-@xmath4 domains",
    ", it was argued in @xcite that by the time the universe cools sufficiently for chemistry - based life to exist in those domains various disasters might already have occurred , such as all baryons having decayed away or all stars having burned out .",
    "those arguments depended crucially on the assumption that universe expands as a power of @xmath2 .",
    "however , it now appears that after dark energy comes to dominate the universe will expand exponentially in @xmath2 .",
    "once the expansion becomes exponential , it does not take long for the universe to reach extremely small temperatures .",
    "for example , consider a domain where @xmath217 ev .",
    "if there were no dark energy , it would take such a domain about @xmath218 years to reach temperatures of order @xmath219 . on the other hand ,",
    "if there were the observed amount of dark energy , it would take only about @xmath220 years .",

    ", this comports with the idea that all the dimensionful parameters of the lagrangian are determined anthropically . in that case one",
    "has to consider simultaneously the probability distributions of @xmath4 , @xmath31 and @xmath229 .",
    "this will be done in section 4 .",
    "it will be seen that the viability of a significant part of the positive @xmath4 parameter space is left unaffected by the  planet argument \" .",
    "however , most of that part of parameter space can be anthropically ruled out by a second argument , which is based on structure formation .",
    "that second argument assumes that structure can not begin to form until recombination occurs .",
    "if by the time of recombination the density of the universe is already dominated by the cosmological constant , then structure will never form .",
    "the recombination temperature @xmath232 is about @xmath233 , so the constraint is that structure can not form unless    @xmath234    this appears to be a much more stringent constraint than the one in eq .",
    "however , it is not clear that it can be used for @xmath216 smaller than about 20 ev .",
    "the point is that , if @xmath235 ev , then when matter begins to dominate over radiation ( at @xmath236 ev ) the electrons will still be almost relativistic , and the thermal number density of electrons and positrons will be larger than that of the baryons by a factor of about @xmath237 .",

    "in fact , we have presented such arguments in section 2 .",
    "what makes the region of parameter space with @xmath303 less viable is a combination of constraints coming from reactions in hydrogen - burning stars like the sun , as one sees from fig .",

    "specifically , the lighter higgs doublet has the coupling @xmath306 .",
    "after qcd chiral symmetry breaking this produces a linear term in the effective potential for @xmath56 that is of the form @xmath307 . since we have assumed that @xmath308 , the coefficient @xmath309 is a slowly varying function of @xmath30 that is of order 1 .",

    "thus we will get qualitatively the right behavior for @xmath316 if we treat @xmath317 as a constant , which we will now do for simplicity . then following the same steps as before one ends up with    @xmath318    and , in terms of the variables @xmath319 and @xmath320 ,    @xmath321    the probability contours for both positive and negative @xmath4 that we have just derived",

    "it is easy to see that the region to the left of the vertical orange line or below the slanted orange line are more fine - tuned than our domain , i.e. @xmath398 .",
    "the shape of the orange line arises from the fact that when @xmath399 , the expression in eq .",

    "positive-@xmath4 region either as not viable or as more improbable than our domain , if the anthropic explanation of the observed values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is to be tenable .",
    "other arguments that were suggested in @xcite hold some promise of being able to do this .",
    "for example , as noted there , it might be that the peculiarities of nuclear physics in the positive-@xmath4 region may lead to runaway nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , the situation for @xmath53 has many unclear aspects , and more thought must be given to it .",
    "we have investigated the possibility that the entire mass matrix of the higgs fields in a two - higgs - doublet model varies among domains of a  multiverse \" .",
    "this means that both the weak scale @xmath403 and @xmath404 vary among domains . making plausible assumptions about probability distributions of parameters in the  landscape \" and about the requirements for life",
    ", we have found that almost all of the @xmath209 space is either anthropically non - viable or much more fine - tuned ( and therefore more rare in the multiverse ) than our domain .",
    "the potentially viable regions are islands in parameter space .",
    "one of these islands is ours , and it is a very small island indeed , as seen in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "if this is the only island of viability , there is the possibility of accounting for two otherwise not easily understood facts about the world we observe , namely that the weak scale is comparable to the strong scale , and that @xmath8 .",
    "whether this is in fact the only island of viability is not yet clear .",
    "there are possible islands of viability in the  light-@xmath136-quark \" and  light-@xmath176-quark \" regions .",
    "however , even if islands of viability do exist in those parts of parameter space they are less probable in the landscape than the island of viability in which our domain is located , according to the analysis of section 3 .",
    "more significant is the possibility of an island of viability in the @xmath53 region of parameter space .",
    "an interesting new twist has been given to the discussion of the positive-@xmath4 case by the discovery of dark matter / cosmological constant .",
    "this discovery ties together the anthropic analysis of the higgs mass given in @xcite and @xcite and the anthropic analysis of the cosmological constant given in @xcite . we have seen that some of the @xmath53 constraints are invalidated by the existence of dark energy , but other and equally strong constraints that depend on the existence of dark energy come into play .",
    "however , the constraints we have discussed are not by themselves enough to rule out the entire @xmath53 region as non - viable .",
    "this seems to be the main loophole at present in the attempt to explain @xmath33 and the value of the weak scale anthropically .",
    "however , it seems probable that much stronger arguments exist for the case of @xmath53 , and that the entire positive-@xmath4 region of parameter space is non - viable .",
    "we have assumed that only the dimensionful parameters of the lagrangian  scan \" , i.e. vary in the multiverse , and that only they are anthropically tuned . this seems like a comparatively conservative assumption , since the dimensionful parameters of our current theories are the least well understood , are the most ( apparently ) fine - tuned , and are the most amenable to anthropic explanation .",
    "however , obviously , other assumptions are possible .",
    "the question for us is whether there exists at least some set of plausible assumptions under which the observed relation @xmath33 can be anthropically explained .",
