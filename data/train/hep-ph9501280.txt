    "this paper is the detailed exposition of our previous letter @xcite on chiral - symmetry breaking in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional qed with @xmath0 flavors of four - component dirac fermions ( hereafter called qed3 ) .",
    "such a model of qed3 is chirally symmetric in the absence of a bare fermion mass term , @xmath1 , in sharp contrast to the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory with two - component fermions , where we can not define chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "similarly to the four - dimensional case @xcite , the chiral symmetry of qed3 may be broken spontaneously due to the dynamical generation of a fermion mass . however the pattern of dynamical symmetry breaking is shown to be qualitatively different from the four - dimensional counterparts .",
    "recently , qed3 has found a vast region of application in condensed matter physics as an effective theory in the long wavelength ( or low - energy ) limit of a more realistic microscopic model @xcite . especially , since the discovery of high-@xmath2 superconductivity and fractional quantum hall effect , a peculiarity of three - dimensional gauge theory , i.e. , the existence of a chern  simons ( cs ) term @xcite @xmath3 has been a basic ingredient in these applications .",
    "the cs term gives the gauge field a mass without destroying the gauge invariance . and",
    ", even if there is no bare cs term in the original lagrangian , a cs term can be generated by radiative corrections in three dimensions . in the presence of a cs term",
    ", parity is broken explicitly , but the lagrangian still keeps the chiral symmetry when @xmath4 .",
    "the parity violation is a very important factor for the anyonic model to be a candidate theory of high-@xmath2 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "a field - theoretic realization of such an anyonic model consists of fermions interacting with an abelian statistical gauge field whose dynamics is governed by a cs term .",
    "in contrast to the chiral symmetry , it is known that the dynamical breakdown of parity does not occur in qed3 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we pay attention to the breaking of chiral symmetry in the presence of a cs term within the framework of the schwinger ",
    "dyson ( sd ) equation @xcite . in momentum space ,",
    "the sd equation for the full fermion propagator @xmath5 is written as @xmath6 which should be solved self - consistently and simultaneously with other sd equations for the full photon propagator @xmath7 and the full vertex function @xmath8 . in order to solve these sets of sd equations actually , however , we adopt some kind of approximations as exemplified below .",
    "there are several quantities we must specify to write down the closed sd equation for the fermion propagator @xmath5 , namely , the full photon propagator @xmath7 and the vertex function @xmath9 , and we also have to choose a suitable gauge . in general , both the photon propagator and the vertex satisfy their own sd equation , and both depend on the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath10 , if the covariant gauge - fixing lagrangian @xmath11 is taken .",
    "there are also additional constraints on these @xmath12-point functions , coming from relations such as the ward ",
    "takahashi ( wt ) identity @xmath13 now one of the problems in qed3 is to find a consistent truncation scheme for the sd equation : as a consequence of the wt identity the wave - function renormalization should be equal to the vertex renormalization , which puts a constraint on the bare vertex approximation . by using @xmath14^{-1 } \\,,\\ ] ] the sd equation for @xmath5 is decomposed into two integral equations for @xmath15 , the wave - function renormalization , and @xmath16 .",
    "although with a bare vertex it is not possible to satisfy the wt identity exactly , we should make sure to satisfy the constraint @xmath17 when using the bare vertex approximation .",
    "first of all , we restrict our attention to qed without cs term . in the quenched case , in which the vacuum polarization to the photon propagator is completely neglected",
    ", the simplest treatment is to choose the landau gauge @xmath18 and to take the bare vertex @xmath19 .",
    "this quenched approximation is equivalent to taking the @xmath20 limit in the sd equation for the fermion propagator , since this limit eliminates the radiative correction to the photon propagator coming from the internal fermion loops ( with @xmath0 species ) .",
    "then the above sd equation leads to no wave - function renormalization : @xmath21 , irrespective of @xmath16 , see e.g. @xcite . in this case",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that quenched qed3 resides in only one phase where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , in agreement with the monte carlo simulation of non - compact lattice qed3 @xcite .    in the quenched case ,",
    "the bare vertex approximation is justified in the landau gauge @xmath22 , because this choice is approximately consistent with the wt identity and satisfies the requirement that the wave - function renormalization and the vertex renormalization are equal . in gauges other than the landau gauge",
    "however , we can not take the bare vertex , since @xmath15 deviates from one .",
    "in order to study the sd equation in a general gauge , we must modify the vertex in such a way that the result is gauge - covariant , i.e. , independent of the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath10 .",
    "this problem persists in the three - dimensional case @xcite as well as in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "such a modified vertex has to satisfy the wt identity exactly .",
    "now we can raise the question whether the chiral symmetry restores at a certain non - zero value of @xmath0 . in the presence of the one - loop vacuum polarization ( @xmath23 )",
    "the simple procedure mentioned above can not be applied , since there is no simple gauge choice @xmath10 such that @xmath21 . nevertheless , under the bare vertex approximation in the landau gauge , appelquist , nash and wijewardhana ( anw ) @xcite have shown that there is a finite critical number of flavors @xmath24 , above which the chiral symmetry restores . based on a leading - order @xmath25 expansion @xcite ( @xmath26 with @xmath27 being kept fixed ) for the vertex and the photon propagator in the sd equation , they gave the critical value @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , nash @xcite claimed that the leading - order _ gauge - invariant _ critical number of flavors is given by @xmath29 and that , when @xmath30 corrections are included , @xmath24 coincides approximately with this result .",
    "however , such a simple treatment of the vertex function and the wave - function renormalization function @xmath31 was criticised by pennington and webb @xcite and atkinson , johnson and pennington @xcite .",
    "they claimed that , if the vertex is correctly improved , using the wt identity , and the coupled equations for @xmath15 and @xmath16 are solved together , the finite critical number of flavors does not exist .",
    "this implies that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in qed3 for all values of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "the monte carlo simulation @xcite of lattice non - compact qed3 seems to support a finite critical flavors : limit ( with @xmath27 being kept finite ) corresponds to the weak - coupling limit @xmath33 in the lattice gauge theory defined on a lattice with lattice spacing @xmath34 . ]",
    "@xmath35 , see also @xcite . however , it is numerically very difficult to confirm the exponential decrease of the dynamical mass for increasing @xmath0 found in @xcite .",
    "the origin of this controversy stems from the fact that in the unquenched case @xmath21 can not be deduced as a simple consequence of the sd equation by choosing the landau gauge , in sharp contrast with the quenched case .",
    "nakatani @xcite has proposed to use a nonlocal and momentum - dependent gauge function , instead of the usual gauge - fixing term , in order to keep @xmath36 and thus to overcome the inconsistency one has using the bare vertex approximation in the landau gauge .",
    "actually the nonlocal gauge found in @xcite can play exactly the same role as the landau gauge in the quenched case , in the sense that @xmath36 follows by choosing the appropriate nonlocal gauge in the bare vertex approximation and that the nonlocal gauge @xmath37 as a function of the photon momentum @xmath38 reduces to the landau gauge in the quenched limit @xmath20 .",
    "taking into account only the leading and next - to - leading order terms in the infrared region , which is the essential region in qed3 @xcite , yields a finite critical number of flavors @xcite @xmath39 which is the same as the leading - order result obtained by nakatani , and coincides with the result obtained by nash in a different way @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the nonlocal gauge as derived in @xcite .    in the present paper the existence of a finite critical number of flavors is confirmed by solving numerically the nonlinear sd equation , using a bare vertex and the nonlocal gauge as derived in @xcite in order to keep @xmath21 , without further approximation .",
    "the parity - conserving and chiral - symmetry - breaking fermion mass is dynamically generated in qed3 and there occurs a chiral - symmetry - restoring phase transition at @xmath40 .",
    "the order of the chiral phase transition is infinite in the sense that the dynamical fermion mass @xmath41 and the chiral order parameter @xmath42 exhibit an essential singularity at the critical point @xmath43 , @xmath44\\,.\\ ] ]    in the presence of cs term , as already reported in @xcite , the chiral phase transition turns into a first - order transition , in sharp contrast to the @xmath45 case .",
    "this result is obtained by both a numerical study of the full sd equation and an analytical study of approximated equations using the same scheme as in the absence of cs term .",
    "we have also determined the critical line @xmath46 for this transition in the @xmath47 plane , the two - dimensional phase diagram . in this paper",
    "we give the detailed exposition of this result @xcite based on the framework of @xcite .",
    "the first - order transition implies that the chiral order parameter as well as the dynamical fermion mass show a discontinuous change at the critical point on the whole critical line extending from @xmath48 in the phase diagram @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , the critical number of flavors @xmath49 decreases as the cs coefficient @xmath50 increases .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ two ]",
    "we give a description of qed3 with a cs term .",
    "we start from the formulation of qed3 using four - component fermions in the reducible representation of the clifford algebra for the @xmath51-matrices in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions .",
    "we define the chiral and the parity transformations for this theory , and our decomposition of the fermion propagator into scalar functions .",
    "we also discuss the structure of the gauge boson propagator with the nonlocal gauge and give an explicit expression for the vacuum polarization in the leading order of @xmath25 expansion .",
    "after these preliminaries , we first discuss qed without the cs term and subsequently study the effect of the explicit cs term . in section [ secpure ]",
    "we write down the sd equation for the fermion propagator explicitly .",
    "the sd equation is solved both analytically and numerically .",
    "next , in section [ explcs ] , we study the effect of the explicit cs term by solving the nonlinear sd equation numerically . in section [ csanal ]",
    "detailed comparison of numerical and analytical result is given and the numerical results in section [ explcs ] are confirmed by the analytical treatment . in order to study the stability of the chiral - symmetry - breaking solution , we evaluate the effective potential of cornwall  jackiw ",
    "tomboulis @xcite in section [ cjtefpot ] .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in appendix",
    "a , we give integration formulae which are necessary to perform the angular integration to obtain the integration kernel in the sd equation . in appendix b , we supplement details on the calculation of the ultraviolet boundary condition . in appendix c",
    ", it is shown that at the stationary point the effective potential obtained in section [ cjtefpot ] actually gives the sd equation for the fermion mass function in the nonlocal gauge .",
    "in euclidean space the lagrangian is @xmath52 we use four - component spinors for the fermions , and accordingly a four - dimensional representation for the @xmath51-matrices of the clifford algebra @xmath53 : @xmath54 with @xmath55 being the pauli matrices ; furthermore we have the matrix @xmath56 , defined by @xmath57    with such a representation we can define chirality just as in four - dimensional qed , but now there are two independent chiral transformations possible , which are defined by the @xmath58 matrices @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath61 without an explicit mass @xmath62 for the fermions , the lagrangian is chirally symmetric , but the mass term @xmath63 breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "note that the other mass term , @xmath64 , is chirally invariant .    in this representation ,",
    "the parity transformation is defined by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "then the mass term @xmath64 is odd under a parity transformation .",
    "also the cs term is odd under this parity transformation , so in the presence of a ( bare ) cs term parity is always broken , even if @xmath68 .",
    "the other terms in the lagrangian , including the chiral - symmetry - breaking mass term , are invariant under a parity transformation .",
    "the inverse full fermion propagator can be written as @xmath69 the functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are scalar functions of the absolute values of the momenta , and their bare values are @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . in order to study the fermion propagator",
    "nonperturbatively it is useful to define the matrix ( projection operator ) @xmath74 which allows us to rewrite the full propagator as @xmath75 where we have defined @xmath76 and @xmath77    in this paper we study the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry , using the sd equation for the fermion propagator .",
    "perturbatively this will not happen , but just as in pure qed ( without cs term ) , chiral symmetry can be broken dynamically due to nonperturbative effects , starting with a chirally symmetric lagrangian .",
    "so in the remainder we have put both explicit masses @xmath62 and @xmath78 equal to zero , and study the behavior of @xmath79 nonperturbatively . note that in terms of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , chiral symmetry means @xmath82 , which gives @xmath83 .",
    "the order parameter connected with the chiral phase transition is the chiral condensate . in the presence of a cs term",
    "there are two types of condensates : a parity even condensate @xmath84 and a parity odd condensate @xmath85 . using the decomposition of the propagator in terms of @xmath86 ,",
    "we can write these condensates as @xmath87 where @xmath88    the general sd equation is given by @xmath89\\,,\\\\   a_\\pm(p^2 ) & = & 1 + \\frac{e^2}{p^2 } \\int\\!\\frac{{\\rm d^3}k}{(2\\pi)^3 }        \\frac12 { \\rm tr}[{\\,\\not\\!p } \\gamma_\\mu",

    "the coupling constant @xmath90 has the dimension of mass , and we use the large @xmath0 limit in such a way that @xmath91 and the product @xmath92 remains fixed : @xmath93 with @xmath27 fixed . in this approximation scheme ,",
    "the full vertex is replaced by the bare vertex , because that is the leading - order contribution in @xmath25 . in order to be consistent with the wt identity , or at least with the requirement that the vertex renormalization and the fermion wave - function renormalization are equal",
    ", we use a suitable nonlocal gauge function .",
    "we use a lagrangian with a so called nonlocal gauge - fixing term for the gauge field , namely @xmath94 which has certain advantages above the normal gauge - fixing term : it allows for a momentum - dependent gauge parameter in the gauge boson propagator .",
    "it is easy to show that this lagrangian leads to the following inverse bare photon propagator @xmath95 where we have defined the momentum - dependent gauge parameter in the following way @xmath96 so if we can simplify the actual calculations by choosing a specific momentum - dependent gauge @xmath97 , we can justify this afterwards by specifying the gauge - fixing term as @xmath98 with @xmath99 the conventional ( local ) gauge can be recovered by the choice @xmath100 , as can easily be seen from the above formulae .",
    "we can show that identities relating the different green s functions , like the wt identity , hold with this nonlocal gauge in exactly the same way as with a constant gauge parameter .",
    "for the ( full ) photon propagator this implies in momentum space @xmath101 this means that also with this nonlocal gauge the gauge - dependent part of the photon propagator is not affected by the interactions , and that the longitudinal part of the vacuum polarization is zero .",
    "therefore we can write the full photon propagator as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 correspond to the decomposition of the vacuum polarization tensor @xcite : @xmath105    in the @xmath25 expansion the one - loop vacuum polarization has to be taken into account , because this vacuum polarization is of order one : there are @xmath0 fermion loops contributing to the vacuum polarization and each loop is of the order @xmath106 . starting with massless fermions , e.g. both the parity odd and parity even mass equal to zero",
    ", there is no parity odd part of the vacuum polarization .",
    "the transverse part of the vacuum polarization is @xmath107 therefore the inclusion of this vacuum polarization leads to the following gauge boson propagator @xmath108 this is the photon propagator we will use in this paper , with a suitable choice for @xmath97 in order to keep the wave - function renormalization equal to one .",
    "without the cs term in the lagrangian , we have no explicit parity breaking terms , and the full fermion propagator will also be parity even : there will be no spontaneous breaking of parity @xcite .",
    "that means that we only have to deal with one set of two coupled integral equations for @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "the condition that the wave - function renormalization is equal to one leads to @xcite @xmath111 the sd equation for the fermions thus reduces to only one nonlinear integral equation for the dynamical mass function , which we call @xmath112 .",
    "after the angular integration , which can be done analytically ( see appendix a ) , the radial integration kernel becomes @xmath113 and the equation for the mass function is @xmath114 this nonlinear integral equation can be solved numerically without further approximations , or it can be solved approximately by using a series expansion for the logarithms .",
    "this last method makes it possible to convert the integral equation into a second - order differential equation , and to study dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking analytically .      in order to solve the equation",
    "analytically we make the replacement @xmath115 , which is a good approximation both for small momenta ( where @xmath116 is almost constant ) , and for relatively large momenta ( where both @xmath117 and @xmath118 are negligible w.r.t .",
    "@xmath119 ) . one can also show that this replacement is in agreement with bifurcation analysis , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for very large momenta ( @xmath120 ) we neglect @xmath121 with respect to @xmath119 in the denominator completely .",
    "another approximation , which is commonly made @xcite , uses the fact that the integral is heavily damped for momenta larger than the mass scale @xmath27 .",
    "all the essential physics comes from the infrared part of the nonlinear interal equation .",
    "therefore one uses a series expansion for the logarithms in eq .",
    "( [ kernpure ] ) for momenta @xmath122 , and introduce a cutoff at @xmath123 . however , we are interested in the behavior of the mass function for momenta @xmath124 as well , especially when we include the cs term . therefore we will adopt a slightly different approximation , which takes into account the ultraviolet tail of the integral as well .    for this purpose",
    "we expand the integration kernel @xmath125 in powers of @xmath126 . to leading order",
    "this gives @xmath127 differentiating eq .",
    "( [ massintpure ] ) with this kernel leads to a second - order differential equation @xmath128 with @xmath129 and two boundary conditions , infrared and ultraviolet ones , just as in the usual approximation scheme .",
    "it is easy to show that the behavior of this differential equation in the infrared region is exactly the same as one would obtain by expanding @xmath130 and @xmath131 for small momenta directly .    for momenta",
    "@xmath132 we expand the functions @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which gives to leading order in @xmath135 @xmath136 to solve this we substitute a solution @xmath137 and again taking into account leading order only we find @xmath22 or @xmath138 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath22 is the solution corresponding to explicit chiral - symmetry breaking , since this leads to @xmath139 in the ultraviolet region . without a bare mass ,",
    "the correct solution is @xmath140 , which shows that the dynamical mass function falls off very rapidly in the ultraviolet region .",
    "this is also consistent with the ultraviolet boundary condition , but it does not provide a normalization condition .    with this knowledge",
    "we now consider integral equation in the infrared region , _ without neglecting the ultraviolet tail of the integral _ : we use @xmath141 for @xmath142 , based on the ultraviolet behavior we have just found , and normalized in such a way that the solution is continuous at @xmath143 ( we do not require the continuity of derivative , @xmath144 , at @xmath143 ) . using the usual approximation @xcite for @xmath145 , we arrive at the integral equation @xmath146 which finally reduces to @xmath147 this leads to exactly the same second - order differential equation in the infrared region @xmath148 as that obtained by neglecting the ultraviolet tail completely , with also the same infrared boundary condition @xmath149    the general solution of eq .",

    "this boundary condition now becomes @xmath153 due to the inclusion of the ultraviolet tail of the integral .",

    "this is not the only solution for the boundary condition ; it is known that there are infinitely many solutions if @xmath159 which behave in general as @xmath160 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] close to the critical number of fermion flavors .",
    "the solution with the largest value of @xmath161 corresponds to the ground state , since this has the lowest energy .",
    "that means @xmath162 in the above equation , and one can also show that the other solutions have an oscillating behavior at large momenta ; only the solution with @xmath162 is a nodeless solution .      alternatively , we can solve the nonlinear integral equation for the mass function , eq .",
    "( [ massintpure ] ) , numerically , without further approximations .",
    "the integral can be calculated numerically without any cutoff , since the integrand falls off rapidly for large momenta and the integral is finite .",
    "solving the integral equation iteratively leads to qualitatively the same result as the previous analysis .",
    "there is a critical number of fermion flavors below which there is a chiral - symmetry - breaking solution .",
    "the critical number is the same as we have just found analytically @xmath163 and also the behavior of the infrared mass @xmath154 is similar as before . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have plotted the infrared mass , or actually @xmath164 , versus @xmath165 for the full integral equation together with the analytical result .",
    "we can see that in both cases the mass behaves like @xmath166 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the only difference is the value of the constants @xmath167 .",
    "the analytical result is @xmath168 and @xmath169 , whereas the full nonlinear equation gives @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "so the main difference between the analytical solution of the approximated equation and the numerical solution of the full equation is an overall normalization factor .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that in the first case we have made several approximations , but these approximations turn out not to be essential for the behavior of the infrared mass near the critical point .",
    "both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet region the numerical and analytical solutions have the same behavior , see fig .",
    "of course , these approximations do make a difference in the region where @xmath135 is of order @xmath27 , but this is to be expected since we expand to leading order only in @xmath172 and @xmath173 respectively .",
    "the order parameter of the chiral phase transition is the chiral condensate @xmath174 in order to get an explicit analytical formula for the condensate , we can use eq .",
    "( [ massexppure ] ) , which allows us to write the condensate in terms of the mass function at @xmath143 . using the same linearization",
    "as before we get @xmath175 from this equation we can calculate how the chiral condensate behaves close to the critical number of fermion flavors , see appendix b , @xmath176 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] alternatively , we can calculate the condensate numerically , using the numerical solution of the full nonlinear integral equation , which shows a similar behavior , see fig .",
    "in this section we add a cs term for the gauge field to the lagrangian .",
    "this breaks the parity explicitly , and gives rise to a parity odd mass term for the fermions , as well as a parity odd part of the gauge boson propagator .",
    "we use the gauge boson propagator as discussed in section [ twosubtwo ] , with the inclusion of the leading - order vacuum polarization .",
    "again we will use a nonlocal gauge - fixing term . for the momentum - dependent gauge function",
    "we use @xcite @xmath177 which leads to a wave - function renormalization almost equal to one , the deviation of one is proportional to @xmath178 , which can be kept very small .      with the above gauge boson propagator and gauge function ,",
    "the sd equation can be rewritten into two decoupled sets of two coupled integral equations for @xmath179 and @xmath80 , respectively for @xmath180 and @xmath81 .",
    "this leads to the following set of equations : @xmath181 the even and odd parts of the scalar function @xmath16 are @xmath182 and @xmath183 in terms of @xmath184 , and similar for @xmath15 . in analyzing these equations",
    "it is important to observe that once we have found a solution for @xmath185 and @xmath186 , we _ automatically _ have also a solution for @xmath187 and @xmath188 : namely the set @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "that means that we can always construct a chirally symmetric ( but parity odd ) solution of the sd equation , with @xmath83 . the question of dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking turns into the question whether or not there exist _ two _ ( or more ) solutions of the set of integral equations .    without the cs term",
    "there is dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking only for @xmath191 as we have just seen .",
    "we therefore expect a similar situation in the presence of the cs term , at least if the parameter @xmath50 is small .",
    "that means that for @xmath192 we have only the chirally symmetric solution of the above equations , but for @xmath159 we expect that there are ( at least ) two solutions for both @xmath80 and @xmath81 possible , which can be distinguished by their behavior under the chiral and parity transformations and by their behavior in the limit @xmath193 .",
    "it is also essential to note that in the presence of an explicit cs term for the gauge field in the lagrangian there is no trivial solution @xmath194 , as there would be without the explicit cs term . due to the explicit breaking of parity",
    ", the fermions always acquire a parity - odd mass @xmath195 , even if the explicit odd mass @xmath78 is zero . at large momenta",
    "the cs term in the sd equation dominates ( at least if there is no explicit mass term present ) , which leads to an ultraviolet behavior of the mass functions @xmath196 at a perturbative level , whereas in the absence of the cs term the mass function @xmath112 falls off like @xmath197 , as we have seen in the previous section .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail when we are studying the breakdown of chiral symmetry analytically .",
    "we have first solved the set of coupled integral equations eq .",

    "it should be remarked that the trivial solution @xmath395 as a trivial stationary point ( equivalently the trivial solution of the sd equation ) is possible only when @xmath45 .",
    "although the symmetric solution @xmath280 gives lower effective potential than the symmetry - breaking solution @xmath386 , we have shown that it is possible to take the limit of removing the external source , @xmath396 , so that the _ spontaneously _ chiral - symmetry - breaking solution @xmath394 is realized .",
    "however it is not yet clear whether they give local minima , local maxima , or possibly a saddle point of the effective potential and whether or not @xmath280 gives the absolute minimum . in order to confirm this issue ,",

    "it is well known @xcite that the nontrivial continuum limit can be possibly taken only at the second- and higher - order transition point where the correlation length diverges ( in units of the lattice spacing ) .",
    "hence our result implies that the meaningful _ continuum _ limit from the broken phase in the nonperturbatively regularized three - dimensional gauge field theory can be taken only at the point @xmath393 , i.e. in the absence of the bare cs term .",
    "this is a novel feature of the three - dimensional gauge field theory with a bare cs term , which seems to be overlooked so far .",
    "our result may have important implications in the application of the three - dimensional gauge theory in condensed - matter physics as a long - wavelength effective theory of the microscopic model .",

    "this result is obtained by using a consistent expansion of the full gauge boson propagator and the vertex in @xmath25 . in order to satisfy the wt identity ( up to terms of order @xmath25 and of order of the dynamically generated mass ) , we have adopted the nonlocal gauge function which allows us to neglect effect from the wave - function renormalization .",
    "a more accurate approximation would include a full @xmath30 calculation , similar to the analysis in @xcite in pure qed . since in pure qed",
    "these @xmath30 corrections do not change the result qualitatively , but only quantitatively ( leading to a slightly different critical number of fermion flavors ) , we do not expect that those corrections will change our present result essentially .",
    "the question of gauge covariance can ( in principle ) be recovered by applying the landau ",
