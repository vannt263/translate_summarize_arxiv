    "the superstring offers the exciting possibility of predicting all the parameters of the standard model in terms of a single parameter , the string tension . however in order to realise the full predictive power of the superstring it is necessary to determine the origin and effects of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "only after susy is broken are the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of moduli determined and these determine the couplings of the effective low energy theory . also susy breaking must be responsible for the splitting of supermultiplets allowing for the superpartners to be heavier than their standard model partners .",
    "in supergravity theories soft susy breaking terms may be added to the lagrangian without introducing new divergences and thus need not spoil the supersymmetric solution to the hierarchy problem . if susy breaking is dominated by the f term of a specific field the soft terms may be related in a model independent way if supersymmetry breaking occurs in a hidden sector with coupling to the visible sector via gravitational effects only@xcite . in this letter",
    "we will investigate the predictions for the moduli and soft terms in superstring theories in which the origin of susy breaking is through a gaugino condensate in the hidden sector .",
    "gaugino condensation offers a very plausible origin for susy breaking for it is very reasonable to expect such a condensate to form at a scale between the planck scale and the electroweak breaking scale if the hidden sector gauge group has a ( running ) coupling which becomes large somewhere in this domain .",
    "non - perturbative studies in effective supergravity theories resulting from orbifold compactification schemes suggest the dynamics of the strongly coupled gauge sector is such that the gaugino condensate will form and trigger supersymmetry breaking .    the advantage of gaugino condensation as the underlying supersymmetry breaking trigger is twofold . in the first place it is generic in 4d - superstring theories to have an hidden sector with a gauge group given by @xmath0 or smaller . for such asymptotically free gauge theories",
    "the coupling usually becomes strong at low scales so gaugino condensation may be expected - thus there is no need to postulate an additional source of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "secondly the scale of gaugino condensation and the associated supersymmetry breaking scale are dynamically determined and thus the mechanism offers an explanation for the magnitude of the hierarchy of masses scales .",
    "thus , when combined with the radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry , the resultant theory not only protects the electroweak and supersymmetry breaking scales from receiving large radiative corrections proportional to the unification or planck scale ( the usual hierarchy problem ) but also predicts the supersymmetry breaking and electroweak breaking scales in terms of the planck scale and the multiplet content of the theory .",
    "in addition , after supersymmetry breaking , the moduli of the theory are fixed giving a prediction for the value of the gauge couplings and the yukawa couplings .    in order to realise the full predictive power of the 4d- superstring theory ,",
    "it is necessary to compute the non- perturbative effects leading to gaugino condensation .",
    "the complete solution is clearly beyond our present - day technology so we are forced to employ approximation methods . in this paper",
    "we will consider the implications for the soft susy breaking parameters in the case that gaugino condensation is the source of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we parameterise the strong binding effects in the hidden sector by a simple effective ( locally supersymmetric ) 4-gaugino coupling .",
    "we then are able to use nambu - jona - lasinio ( n - j - l ) techniques @xcite to obtain non- perturbative information about the gaugino binding .",
    "this shows that a reasonable pattern of supersymmetry breaking is possible with a single gaugino condensate .",
    "we generalize the discussion of reference @xcite to consider an orbifold model which includes different moduli fields and we determine the tree level potential and the one - loop radiative corrections due to strong gaugino binding .",
    "we show that minimization of the potential leads to vacuum expectation values ( v.e.v.s ) for the moduli which either take dual invariant values or have a common value related to the v.e.v . of the dilaton .",
    "this naturally allows for squeezed orbifolds which were found to be better candidates for minimal string unification",
    ". we also include chiral matter fields in the visible sector and determine the soft susy breaking terms . unlike results obtained",
    "previously we find that the radiative corrections stabilise the potential for vanishing v.e.v.s of the matter fields .",
    "we also find values for the soft parameters which lie outside the favoured range of `` model '' independent parameterisations of the soft terms due to our inclusion of large non - perturbative effects beyond string tree level in the effective potential .",
    "of course , due to the simplicity of our model for strong binding , our results should be considered as only indicative of those to be expected in a complete gauge theory .",
    "however , they do show the importance of including the full nonperturbative effects of gaugino binding before extracting predictions for susy breaking phenomena .",
    "we start with the effective theory following from a 4-d superstring orbifold model .",
    "it is specified by the kahler potential @xmath1 and the gauge kinetic function @xmath2 given by k =- ln(s+|s+2_ik_a_gs^ilnt_ri)- _",
    "iln(t+|t)_i + _ i k^i_i(t,|t)|_i|^2 , w = w_0+w_m , and f_0=s+2_i(b^i_a - k_a^i_gs)ln ( ( t_i)^2 ) where @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the quadratic casimir operator of the gauge group @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the level of the corresponding kac - moody lalgebra for the gauge group @xmath5 and @xmath7 is the green - schwarz term needed to cancel the gauge independent part of the duality anomaly .",
    "@xmath8 in eq.([eq : w ] ) is the scalar potential due to the gaugino condensate ( see below ) and @xmath9 the matter superpotential .",
    "the subscript , 0 , on the gauge kinetic function @xmath2 indicates that it is given at the string scale and the form of eq.([a8 ] ) includes the contribution from the massive kaluza - klein modes .",
    "the normalization of the kinetic term for the chiral matter superfields is given by @xmath10 which is a polynomial function of the moduli fields , k^i_i=_ja_it_rj^n_ij where @xmath11 a constant ( in most cases @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is the modular weight of the superfield @xmath14 with respect to the real part , @xmath15 , of the moduli @xmath16 .",
    "eq.([a7 ] ) was derived for @xmath17 .",
    "note that the kahler potential includes the green - schwarz term and the dilaton transforms under duality in a non - trivial way ( @xmath18 ) so that @xmath19 is duality invariant .",
    "the form of this effective theory is fixed by the requirement that it should correspond to the strongly coupled theory in the hidden sector .",
    "we have suggested a simple approximation to this structure which , we hope , captures the essentials of the strong binding effects leading to gaugino condensate .",
    "the basis of this approximation is to start with a ( n=1 locally supersymmetric ) four fermion description of the strong hidden sector interaction and to use nambu - jona - lasinio techniques to compute the non- perturbative effects responsible for gaugino condensation .",
    "the model is defined by w_0=_i^-2(t_i ) f = f_0+ln(/ ) where @xmath20 is an auxiliary chiral superfield and @xmath21 .",
    "duality invariance fixes the mass parameter @xmath22 in eq.([a12 ] ) to be @xmath23 with @xmath24 duality invariant .",
    "we choose @xmath25 so that the parameter @xmath22 becomes , at the field theoretical limit , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the compactification scale . since @xmath22 is non - holomorphic , consistency with supersymmetry requires to interpret @xmath22 as wave function renormalization of the dilaton field .",
    "in such a case @xmath22 would appear in the kahler potential and not in the kinetic function .    from the classical equation of motion the scalar component of the auxiliary field @xmath20",
    "is given in terms of the gaugino bilinear by = |_r _ l while the fermion component is given in terms of the gaugino and chiral fermions .",
    "for the choice of @xmath32 and @xmath2 given in eq.([a11 ] ) and eq.([a12 ] ) the f - terms for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 fields are h_s =- e^g/2g_s+ f_s |_l_r = e^k/2w_0 and h_t_i = e^kw_0where @xmath33 .",
    "the tree level scalar potential is then v_0=m^2_3/2 b_0 with b_0= and @xmath34 the eisenstein modular form with weight 1/2 .",
    "the gravitino mass is given by m^2_3/2=e^k_i|(t_i)|^-4||^2 . clearly susy will be broken and a non - zero gravitino mass will result only if there is a non - vanishing v.e.v for @xmath35 generating a non - zero @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "eq.([a18 ] ) ) . assuming this to be the case and solving eq.([a12 ] ) gives a parameterisation of gaugino condensation equivalent to that derived by other methods @xcite- . to this extent the form of eq.([a20 ] ) is just a re - parameterisation of the usual model of gaugino condensation .",
    "where we depart from this analysis is our inclusion of radiative corrections in the effective potential .",
    "summing these effects to all orders shows that the gaugino condensate dynamically forms .",
    "using eq.([a13 ] ) the scalar potential may be written in terms of the gaugino field v_0=||_r_l|^2 where the factor of @xmath37 in the denominator in eq.([e29 ] ) appears because we have rescaled the gaugino fields appearing in this equation to have canonical kinetic terms .",
    "thus we see that the choice of @xmath32 and @xmath2 in eqs.([a11 ] ) and ( [ a12 ] ) leads to a four - fermion interaction with strength proportional to @xmath38 .    in a pure gauge theory",
    "the running gauge coupling is related to @xmath2 by @xmath39 with = + b_aln()+_a where @xmath40 is the level of the corresponding kac - moody algebra for the gauge group @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the n=1 @xmath43-function coefficient and @xmath44 the number of chiral fields in a representation @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the renormalization scale below which the coupling constants begins to run m^2_a=_i(t_ri)^_aim_s^2 where @xmath47 and the constants @xmath48 is model and gauge dependent .",
    "_ ai= in the case of a single overall ( 1,1 ) moduli @xmath49 , @xmath50 , with @xmath51 one obtains the `` naive '' field theoretical expression for @xmath52 .",
    "the existence of an infinite number of massive states ( kaluza and winding states ) , above the string scale , give rise to string threshold contribution @xmath53 which are relevant to the determination of the coupling constant at the string scale ( cf .",
    "eq.([a8 ] ) ) . in the effective four fermion theory defined by eqs.([a11 ] ) to ( [ e29 ] ) @xmath38 sets the scale for the strength of the interaction ( cf .",
    "eq.([e29 ] ) ) .",
    "if the theory is to model the strong binding effects due to a gauge interaction it clearly should be related to the gauge coupling @xmath54 .",
    "thus @xmath38 does indeed run like @xmath55 .",
    "however this running gives rise to an unphysical singularity in @xmath38 related to the landau singularity which we will choose to regulate when applying eq.([a13 ] ) .",
    "below the scale at which the running coupling becomes large the hidden sector states are confined and have a mass of @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus we expect the 4 fermion effective interaction to be pointlike at scales below @xmath57 and so we cutoff the growth implied by eq.([e29 ] ) when the strength of the interaction reaches @xmath58 .",
    "the tree level potential for @xmath35 , given by eqs.([a20]),([a21 ] ) and ( [ a22 ] ) , has no stable solution .",
    "this is consistent with the observation @xcite that gaugino condensation as usually parameterised does not occur in models with a single hidden sector gauge group factor .",
    "however we have argued it is essential to go beyond tree level to include non - perturbative effects in the effective potential which may allow for a non - trivial minimum even in the simple case of a single hidden sector gauge group . this non - perturbative sum ( equivalent to the njl sum )",
    "is readily obtained simply by computing the one loop correction to v. if these destabilise the potential the resultant minimum will correspond to a cancelation of tree level and one - loop terms which , as noted above , is necessarily non - perturbative in character @xcite .",
    "the one - loop radiative corrections may be calculated using the coleman - weinberg one - loop effective potential , v_1= str d^2 p p^2 ln(p^2+m^2 ) where @xmath59 represents the square mass matrices and @xmath60 the supertrace . as discussed above the 4 fermi interaction",
    "has a form factor which falls rapidly above @xmath57 effectively giving a momentum space cutoff at the condensation scale defined as the scale where the gauge coupling constant ( cf .",
    "eq.([a1 ] ) ) becomes strong .",
    "the leading contribution to the one - loop potential @xmath61 comes from the supersymmetry breaking mass of the gaugino fields and keeping only these terms one has v_1=-_c^4j(x_g ) with j ( x)=x+x^2 ln()+ln(1+x ) @xmath62 ( @xmath63 the dimension of the hidden gauge group ) and @xmath64 . the tree level gaugino mass is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 given in eq.([a21 ] ) and the factor @xmath67 in eq.([a30 ] ) is due to non - canonical kinetic terms for the gauginos .",
    "in addition there should be a supersymmetric contribution to the mass of the hidden sector states , gauginos and gauge bosons , generated by the strong hidden sector forces which ( in analogy with qcd ) may be expected to be confining . since the inclusion of these supersymmetric masses only results in a shift of the v.e.v . of the dilaton field",
    "we will not consider them in this paper .",
    "we now consider the minimisation of the full effective potential , @xmath68 . as discussed in @xcite , a supersymmetry breaking solution with non zero @xmath35",
    "is found for a large four fermion coupling . to regulate the unphysical divergence coming from the vanishing of @xmath69 we cut off its evolution at @xmath70 , the point at which the gauge coupling becomes large .",
    "this is done to give the dimensionally correct form for the effective four fermion interaction at low energies , @xmath71 . with this",
    "there is a well defined minimum with the condition @xmath72 being satisfied through a cancelation of tree level with one loop terms . as such it is necessarily non- perturbative and shows that , within our four fermion approximation , gaugino condensation is dynamically generated .",
    "the condition @xmath73 can be satisfied either for @xmath31 at the dual invariant points ( @xmath74 ) or for large values of @xmath75 corresponding to squeezed orbifolds . in the latter case",
    "only if @xmath76 it is possible that different moduli @xmath31 and @xmath16 have a large v.e.v and their v.e.v.s will necessarily be the same ( up to modular invariant transformations ) , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "we see that it is thus only possible to have a large overall moduli @xmath78 if all three @xmath79 have the same value , as in the case for a @xmath80 or @xmath81 orbifold where all @xmath79 vanish . for an orbifold with two completely rotated planes then only one @xmath79 is ( possibly ) different than zero in which case the v.e.v . for",
    "the moduli attached to this plane will be different than those of the other two .",
    "a squeezed orbifold may thus naturally be obtained .",
    "the v.e.v . of @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    "are given in terms of the dimension of the hidden gauge group , its one - loop n=1 @xmath43-function coefficient and @xmath84 by y=8 and x_gln(x_g)=(3 - 1 ) from eq.([eq : e ] ) we obtain the value of the moduli _ i(1-_i)t_ri=- ln(q ) where the sum in eq.([a37 ] ) is over all moduli that acquire a v.e.v different from the dual invariant points and @xmath85 .",
    "if the gauge group is broken down from @xmath86 to a lower rank group such as @xmath87 with @xmath88 ( as can be easily done by compactifying on an orbifold with wilson lines ) a phenomenologically interesting solution can be obtained with only one gaugino condensate . the value of the dilaton is mainly given by the dimension of the hidden gauge group and for a phenomenologically interesting solution one needs @xmath89 .",
    "in particular if the hidden sector gauge group is @xmath90 the gauge coupling constant at the unification scale would be @xmath91 . using eq.([a36 ] ) , the fine structure constant at the unification scale is given by ^-1_gut=()^-1 .",
    "for an @xmath90 gauge group @xmath92 .",
    "this value is consistent with minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) unification .    on the other hand , the v.e.v . of the moduli fields",
    "does depend on @xmath48 , the v.e.v . of the dilaton and @xmath93 .",
    "the value of @xmath84 is approximately @xmath94 if either the modular weight of the hidden matter fields is @xmath95 ( i.e. untwisted fields ) or if the dominant term in the n=1 @xmath43-function coefficient for the hidden gauge group @xmath93 is given by the quadratic casimir operator @xmath4 , in which case from eq.([alpha ] ) ( taking @xmath96 ) @xmath97 if we only consider the three diagonal ( 1,1 ) moduli ( which are always present in orbifold compactification ) then , for a gravitino mass of order @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath100 depending on whether three , two or one moduli get a `` large '' v.e.v . , respectively . in the case discussed above of a large overall modulus @xmath101 .",
    "note that this result is quite different from the values previously obtained @xmath102 .",
    "clearly the discrepancy is due to the inclusion of the strong gaugino binding effects in @xmath61 ( cf .",
    "eq.([a29 ] ) ) .      up to now",
    "we have only considered the scalar potential for gauginos in the hidden sector , dilaton and moduli fields .",
    "we would now like to include the contribution from matter superfields .",
    "in general the matter superpotential is given as a power series expansion in the chiral superfields @xmath105 suppressed by the planck mass . in the absence of linear and quadratic terms , the leading term in the superpotential is cubic in the matter superfields since one assumes that the matter fields at most get a small v.e.v .",
    "compared to the planck mass to be consistent with the kahler expansion in eq.([a7 ] ) , i.e. @xmath106 . the gaugino condensate term @xmath8 will then give the dominant contribution to the scalar potential and the v.e.v .",
    "of the dilaton and moduli fields obtained in eqs.([a36 ] ) and ( [ a37 ] ) will remain valid .    for a generic matter superpotential @xmath9 , using the kahler potential of eq.([a7 ] ) , the tree level scalar potential is v_0=e^k((k^-1)^s_s|f_sw_0 + k_s w_m|^2 + _ i(k^-1)^i_i|f_iw_0+_i|^2 - 3|w_0+w_m|^2 ) where @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath93 is the one - loop beta function coefficient for the hidden gauge group , @xmath110 is the derivative of the gauge kinetic function with respect to the i - field and the index @xmath111 runs over all matter and moduli fields . the first term in eq.([a45 ] ) is just the square of the auxiliary field of the dilaton @xmath36 while the second term is a sum of the squares of the auxiliary fields of the moduli @xmath112 and chiral matter fields @xmath113 .    to determine the vacuum structure one has to include quantum corrections and the main contribution to the one - loop potential",
    "is again given by the gaugino - loops .",
    "we would like to emphasise again that , although we are just calculating the one - loop potential , the final result is necessarily non - perturbative , since by solving the mass gap equation one is stabilizing the tree level potential by the one- loop potential , and one is effectively summing an infinite number of gaugino - bubbles .",
    "one can easily determine the contribution of these loops by calculating the gaugino mass at tree level and then using eq.([a29 ] ) .",
    "since all dependence on the gaugino bilinear in eq.([a13 ] ) is given in @xmath8 one has , m_g = e^k/2h with hf^s(k^-1)^s_s(f_s w_0+k_sw_m)+f^i(k^-1)^i_i(f_i w_0+_i)-3(w_0+w_m ) .",

    "the leading contribution from the superpotential of eq.([eq : cc ] ) is through the auxiliary field of @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) .",

    "it is in fact this term that gives the main contribution to the scalar potential even for non - vanishing v.e.v . of @xmath127 and since it is positive it allows for the cancellation of the cosmological constant by fine tuning @xmath130 .",
    "while such a tuning is unnatural , it does demonstrate that it is possible to have a zero cosmological constant with supersymmetry broken at a phenomenologically realistic value .",
    "it is now straightforward to compute the soft supersymmetry breaking masses in the visible sector .",

    "there are two reasons for this . in the first place the mechanism explored here , being nonperturbative , necessarily requires that loop corrections to the potential be as important as the tree level contribution .",

    "this is welcome since one - loop diagrams , associated to the complex phases of the trilinear terms , contribute to the electric dipole moment of the neutron . for @xmath177 ,",
    "this contribution is about @xmath178 bigger than the experimental values .",
    "furthermore an @xmath179 minimizes the unification scale and allows for unifying the standard model gauge groups with the hidden sector one and the fine tuning parameter @xmath154 is smallest .",
    "thus , from all the range of possible values for the parameters @xmath180 and @xmath84 , consistency with the mssm and electroweak breaking , selects a very narrow band .",
    "it is remarkable that the values of all soft supersymmetric terms improve within this band taking quite acceptable values .        to summarise ,",
    "we have considered the phenomenological implications of susy breaking triggered by a gaugino condensate in the hidden sector . in a supergravity theory the strong binding effects play a role in all sectors of the theory and must be included .",
    "here we have modelled these effects via a simple ( n=1 locally supersymmetric ) four gaugino interaction which allowed us to use n - j - l techniques to estimate the nonperturbative physics .",
    "we thus constructed the modular invariant effective potential which determines the magnitude of the gaugino condensate and also the moduli of the theory .",
    "we have generalized the work in by including several moduli fields . as a result of minimizing the scalar potential we found that the v.e.v . of the dilaton",
    "is mainly given by the dimension of the hidden sector gauge group .",
    "for reasonable hidden sector gauge groups a large mass hierarchy can arise together with an acceptable value for the fine structure constant at the string scale with only one gaugino condensate .",
    "we found that the extremum eqs .",
    "for the moduli are solved for a unique value of the parameter @xmath84 ( cf .",
    "eq.([alpha ] ) ) and thus the v.e.v . of the moduli",
    "take a common value ( @xmath77 ) related to @xmath183 and the v.e.v of the dilaton or they take the dual invariant values ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "this result naturally accommodates the squeezed orbifold solutions which are better candidates for minimal string unification .",
    "we also showed that it is possible to fine tune the cosmological constant to zero while having susy broken at a phenomenologically interesting value . incorporating chiral matter fields we computed the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "the ratio between the scalar and gaugino mass is given and it depends on @xmath183 and the v.e.v . of the dilaton .",
    "the numerical values for phenomenologically interesting solutions are consistent with results obtained from requiring acceptable values for the gauge couplings , electroweak breaking , dark matter abundance and @xmath185 assuming a minimal unification of the mssm@xcite .",
