    "they are uniquely determined by an invariance property : their measure is unchanged under left and right conjugation by real orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic unitary matrices respectively .",
    "significantly , it was found by explicit calculation that in the bulk scaling limit the two - point correlation functions for the two classes of ensembles are identical . extrapolating this to the conjecture that for a given @xmath6 , all statistical properties of the bulk states of the circular and gaussian ensembles are identical was important at the time , as it allowed calculations to be carried out on the computationally simpler circular ensembles , with the aim of answering questions relating to gaussian hermitian matrices .",

    "the proof of the conjecture that for @xmath22 and 4 the bulk states of the circular and gaussian ensembles are the same became possible after another landmark paper of dyson @xcite . in this work",

    "the quaternion determinant in ( [ 4 ] ) is then given in terms of a pfaffian according to @xmath31 .",

    "a second such generalization is @xcite @xmath43 this describes a boltzmann factor of a so - called generalized plasma : the couplings ( exponents on the products of differences ) @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 for the two species ( r)oman and ( g)reek no longer satisfy @xmath47 as they do in ( [ 4.2 ] ) . with the complex exponentials replaced by general complex coordinates ,",

    "are in the existing literature .",
    "one is the exact evaluation of the normalization , @xmath50 and the other is an exact evaluation of the two - point correlations .",

    "we generalize this pfaffian formula to a form suitable for application to the second problem , but we leave the required subsequent working to a later work .",
    "the previously computed two - point correlations ( [ 10])([12 ] ) hold in the bulk scaling limit .",
    "we obtain the corresponding @xmath42-point correlation functions by taking the bulk scaling limit of our finite system results . in the work @xcite",

    "in physical terms these say that upon fixing a roman species particle , the other roman species particles collectively redistribute to exactly cancel out the density of this particle .",

    "the sum rules ( [ 13a ] ) say that the effect of fixing a single @xmath37 charge species is for both the @xmath37 and @xmath39 charges to collectively respond to exactly cancel out this charge density , and similarly the effect of fixing a @xmath39 charge species .",
    "notice that ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 13a ] ) involve the truncated two particle correlations .",
    "in general the @xmath42-point correlation @xmath191 does not decay for large distances in any of its arguments and consequently can not be integrated over @xmath192 with respect to any one of its arguments .",
    "however , by adding suitable linear combinations of lower order correlations to @xmath193 a quantity @xmath194  the fully truncated @xmath42-point correlation  can be obtained , which has the property of decaying when any one particle coordinate is taken to infinity .",
    "the simplest case is when @xmath195 and we have for example @xmath196 .",
    "a significant feature of the pfaffian form ( [ mr2 ] ) for the correlation functions is that it allows for @xmath197 in the general case to be written in the structured form ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.1.2 ) @xmath198 where @xmath199 , @xmath200 refers to the species of coordinate @xmath201 ( thus @xmath202 , @xmath203 ) and the operator @xmath204 refers to @xmath205 .",
    "for the two - component plasma the general truncated @xmath3-point correlation satisfies a generalization of the sum rules ( [ 13a ] ) ( * ? ? ? * ( 14.20 ) ) , @xmath206 here the factors of 2 are due to the charge density being the fundamental quantity .",
    "this sum rule is equivalent to the requirement that upon fixing @xmath37 charges at @xmath207 and @xmath39 charges at @xmath208 , the charge density of the system responds to exactly cancel these fixed charges .",
    "we know that for the generalized plasma , in the case of the two - point functions , the stronger sum rules ( [ 13 ] ) hold true .",
    "we will see that the existence of stronger screening rules is restricted to @xmath209 , while more generally @xmath210 in contrast to ( [ 13b ] ) there are no factors of 2 indicating that screening is due to the total particle density rather than total charge density . the sum rule ( [ 13c ] ) is corollary of the following integration formulas for the matrix kernels ( cf .",
    "4.7 ) ) .",
    "we have @xmath211    proof .",

    "the derivation of the remaining formulas in ( [ 54a ] ) proceeds similarly .",
    "@xmath93    we see that indeed that after substituting ( [ 14 ] ) in the lhs of ( [ 13b ] ) and using the integration formulas ( [ 54a ] ) that the rhs of ( [ 13c ] ) results . in the case of species",
    "@xmath216 only , we similarly deduce the stronger result @xmath217 on the other hand , in the case of species @xmath94 only , while @xmath218 satisfies the stronger sum rule in ( [ 13 ] ) , it follows from ( [ f1 ] ) that we do not have for example that @xmath219 is equal to @xmath220 .",
    "a possible limit of the two - component system is to take the density of one of the species to infinity , while keeping the density of the other species fixed .",
    "it turns out that this limit applied to the two - point correlations reveals a dramatic difference between the true log - potential plasma system ( [ 4.2 ] ) and the generalized plasma ( [ 5.1 ] ) .    for the generalized plasma ,",
    "we see from ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) that @xmath221 on the other hand , the explicit form of the two - point correlations for the true log - potential plasma system ( [ 4.2 ] ) @xcite allows us to compute that @xmath222 where it is assumed @xmath223 .",
    "thus in the latter case the fixed density species become uncorrelated when placed in a sea of the other species .",
    "this contrasts to the behaviour exhibited by the generalized plasma , in which for this setting the fixed density species still exhibits slowly decaying correlations .",
    "some insight into the reason for this is that , in the notation for the couplings of the generalized plasma introduced below ( [ 5.1 ] ) , arguments based on the direct correlation function were used to obtain the predictions for the large distance asymptotic forms @xmath224 where @xmath225 .",
    "these are independent of the particle density .",
