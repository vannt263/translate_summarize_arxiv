    "launching surface plasmon - polaritons ( spp ) along metal surfaces has recently attracted a lot of interest for its possible application in integrated optical devices.@xcite one of the most common configurations used employs systems with translational symmetry in one direction , as a subwavelength slit@xcite or a line defect@xcite .",
    "very recently , several studies have been devoted to finding simple analytical models for the electromagnetic ( em ) field radiated by a single slit , which provides insight into the relevant physical processes.@xcite it has been found that the field at the surface presents a rich behavior as a function of both frequency and distance to the slit . typically , at distances less that 2 - 3 wavelengths , the field presents a complex spatial dependence@xcite ( which is sometimes phenomenologically described as composed of a spp plus a  creeping \" or  quasi - cilyndrical \" wave , cw @xcite ) . at larger distances , there is an intermediate regime where the em field is dominated by the spp contribution , and a long - distance regime where the spp has become negligible and the field is that of a norton wave ( nw ) .",
    "all the previously cited works focused on the case of field propagation perpendicular to the slit , and did not addressed the situation of non - normal incidence of light into the defect .",
    "this is a serious deficiency as spp scattering effects are easier to detect when the spp is launched obliquely , i.e. , when its wavevector has a component along the slit axis .",
    "@xcite        in this paper we fill this gap , presenting an analysis of the em fields on the metal surface obliquely launched by a subwavelength one - dimensional aperture .",
    "such a launching could be realized by illuminating a subwavelength slit in a thick metal film by a plane wave in the conical mount , where the incident wavevector and the electric field have a non - zero components along the slit axis and across the slit , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . from now on",
    ", we will denote this configuration as  oblique incidence \" .",
    "the subwavelength slit `` filters '' the em field inside it , so that only a capacitor - like fundamental mode transfers the energy to the outgoing face of the film , all other modes inside the slit being exponentially suppressed . for oblique incidence",
    ", the @xmath1-vector of the fundamental mode has a finite projection along the slit axis and therefore the field emerging from the outgoing aperture gains both @xmath2- and @xmath0-polarization components .",
    "here we do not consider the part of the problem related to the transmission and reflection efficiencies , but concentrate on the electric field pattern on the outgoing face of the film .",
    "we thus only need to know the green s function of our system and the field at the outgoing face of the slit .",
    "for this we apply the mathematical methods described in ref .  , which have been previously used for obtaining the field at the metal surface radiated both by a single slit for @xmath3@xcite and by a subwavelength hole@xcite .",
    "anticipating things , we would like to stress that the situation where @xmath4 , presents two main differences with the case @xmath3 : ( _ i _ ) the transmitted electric fields have components parallel to the slit axis and ( _ ii _ ) the propagation length of the excited spp along the direction across the slit diminishes approximately as @xmath5 .",
    "the latter fact favors bringing closer to the slit the region where norton waves dominate .",
    "let us consider a plane monochromatic wave incident onto a thick metallic film with a subwavelength slit centered at @xmath6 .",
    "the wavevector of the incident wave is @xmath7 , forming an angle @xmath8 with respect to the oy axis , and the wave is polarized perpendicularly to the slit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . if the incoming dielectric media has the dielectric permittivity @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 . due to the translational symmetry of the system ,",
    "the @xmath12-component of the wavevector is conserved in the transmission process .",
    "this places constrains onto the angular interval where transmitted radiation can be found .",
    "if the outgoing half - space has dielectric permittivity @xmath13 , the range of the allowable angles is given by @xmath14 , or @xmath15 ( otherwise , the field has evanescent character in the outgoing region ) .",
    "for example , if the field is incident from the glass substrate with @xmath16 and the outgoing medium is vacuum , the permissible angles are @xmath17 .",
    "let us start with a note on the notation used : throughout the paper , distances in lower case letters are expressed in dimensionless units , defined as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the dimensionless wavevector components are denoted as @xmath20 ( so that , for instance , the light cone in vacuum corresponds to @xmath21 ) .    starting from lippmann - schwinger integral equation and taking into account that the field in the slit points along the @xmath22-direction @xmath23 , the expression for the transmitted field simplifies to ( see appendix for details ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the dielectric constants of dielectric in the outgoing region and the metal are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and @xmath28 is the skin depth in the metal .",
    "the integration in @xmath29 is performed across the slit area .",
    "the cyclic dependency upon the coordinate @xmath12 , @xmath30 is omitted here and in what follows .",
    "@xmath31 is the @xmath22-column of the green s dyadic , @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 being unitary vector along @xmath34 axis ) , whose angular representation for the case of arbitrary @xmath35 reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 , indices `` @xmath2 '' and `` @xmath0 '' stay for corresponding polarizations and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fresnel transmission coefficients for the metal - dielectric interface , given by @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the branches of @xmath44 , @xmath45 must be chosen in accordance with the radiation conditions @xmath46 .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath47 the integrals transform to the case of in - plane launching ( see refs . ) and @xmath0-components of the fields vanish .    for narrow ( subwavelength ) slits , the field inside the slit can be taken as independent of @xmath22 and , therefore , the outgoing slit aperture is equivalent to the effective two - dimensional electric dipole located on the metal surface@xcite : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the width of the slit ( in dimensionless units ) .    the numerical computation of the integrals in eq .",
    "are notoriously difficult , due to the simultaneous presence of poles , branch cuts , and strongly oscillatory factors .",
    "using a special mathematical treatment based on the steepest descent method,@xcite an accurate analytical representation of the asymptotic behavior of the field is possible .",
    "we present here the final result for the field at the metal surface @xmath51 ; the mathematical details can be found in the appendix . introducing the following notation @xmath52 we have in the region @xmath53 : @xmath54 .",

    "the factor @xmath58 , appearing in the argument of the complementary error function , @xmath59 , is the position of the pole in the complex plane where the steepest - descent integration is made ( see appendix ) .",
    "it has an important significance , being responsible for the asymptotic expansion of the error function , whose argument is the the square root of the so called numerical distance introduced by sommerfeld .",
    "another property of @xmath60 is that @xmath61 quantify the distance in complex @xmath62space between the spp pole and the branch - point placed at @xmath63 ( i.e. at @xmath64 ) .",
    "the terms in eq .",
    "containing @xmath65 come from the singular part of the integrals in eq .   appearing for @xmath2-polarization .",
    "@xmath65 are the residues at @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "finally , @xmath69 are contributions to the algebraically - decaying term , that in this 1d geometry go like @xmath70 , which dominate the far - field region at the surface ( unless the system is completely absorptionless ) @xmath71    it is remarkable that the region for validity of the solution - is much less restrictive than @xmath53 ( i.e. @xmath72 ) , similarly to what occurred in the case of @xmath47@xcite .",
    "notice , nevertheless , that as @xmath73 increases this formal condition is fulfilled for larger values of @xmath22 , which explains that , at a fixed distance , the relative error in the field increases with @xmath73 . to characterize the relative error , we have introduced the following function @xmath74 with @xmath75 , where @xmath76 correspond to precise numeric calculations and @xmath77 is given by eqs .  - .",
    "except for @xmath78 this error is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath79 , and , therefore , almost independent of wavelength ( from the optical region to longer wavelengths ) .",
    "we have checked that the relative error does not exceed a few percents for distances as small as @xmath80 , and already for @xmath81 of order of a wavelength the error has reduced down to 0.1% at @xmath47 ( and @xmath82 at @xmath78 ) , see fig .",

    "then the electric field at the surface is perpendicular to it and , for a very thin slit , can be analytically calculated using directly eqs .",
    ", : @xmath86 with @xmath87 being hankel function of first order .",
    "the pec limit of the asymptotic expansion has to be taken with care , as the green s dyadic tends to zero as @xmath88 .",
    "this is natural , since the dipole placed on the metal interface and oriented along it , can not radiate due to cancellation of the field by the image dipole",
    ". however , the effective dipole of the slit diverges as @xmath89 , so that the product @xmath90 remains finite . if we substitute eqs .  - into eq .",
    "and perform the pec limit , we arrive at the asymptotic expansion for eq .  .",
    "this expansion consists of just one term , where the hankel function is replaced by its asymptotic term @xmath91 .",

    "all fields are normalized to @xmath105 , which is taken as a representative value in the near field.,width=302 ]    the fields for both vacuum - gold and vacuum - pec interfaces are shown , under the assumption that they are launched by slits with the same amplitude of the electric field on their exit apertures .",
    "the spatial dependence of the field is quite different in these two cases . instead of the cylindrical wave - type algebraic decay @xmath106 along the pec surface ,",
    "the field along the vacuum - gold interface shows two different behaviors , separated at the crossover distance , @xmath107 .",
    "it must be stressed that the chosen wavelength , @xmath103 nm , and the type of the metal ( gold ) does not represent a special case with some particular properties , but corresponds to a small value of @xmath107 .",
    "otherwise , the physics for this case is as rich as for other wavelengths .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in a very close vicinity to the slit @xmath108 , the behavior of the field is complex and contains the contribution from all the angular spectrum of the green s function , or in other words , from all the density of em states .",
    "phenomenologically , the field in this region has been represented by a spp plus an additional contribution ( defined as the total field minus the spp one ) denoted either `` creeping wave '' or `` quasi - cylindrical wave '' ( cw , see refs .  ) .",
    "as mentioned before , eq .   faithfully represents the field ( and thus the cw ) for @xmath109 . as @xmath81 increases ,",
    "all the smooth parts in the angular spectra in the integral are progressively canceled out due to integration with the oscillatory factor @xmath110 , so that only the sharp regions ( with width @xmath111 ) of the spectrum give a finite net contribution .",
    "these regions correspond to the vicinities of either the pole @xmath112 ( which is a feature of a finite width ) or the kink @xmath21 ( which has zero width in @xmath113-space ) .",
    "the field in the region where these two contributions dominate , can be found by asymptotically expanding eq .  ,",
    "see subsection  [ sff ] .    the electric field corresponding to the spp and nw terms",

    "[ fig3 ] . at distances from the slit of order of one wavelength , both field amplitude and phase [ see inset ( a ) in fig .  [ fig3 ] ]",
    "are well approximated by the spp contribution , and the influence of the nw is weak .",
    "the field is locally enhanced comparing to the pec case , and the efficiency of the spp excitation depends upon wavelength . in the region close to the asymptote in the spp dispersion relation ( @xmath114 ) , the density of electromagnetic states increases and so it does the local field enhancement . however , while the mode becomes both slower and more confined , due to the increase of its wavevector , the absorption increases as well and the spp mode is quenched at a smaller distance from the source .    .",
    "the wavelength is @xmath103 nm . the normalization of the fields is the same as in fig .",
    "the inset ( a ) shows the dependency of the ratio between the crossover distance and spp propagation length ratio , @xmath115 , as a function of @xmath73 and for different wavelengths .",
    "the continuous curves are for @xmath116 , while the discontinuous ones are for @xmath117 .",
    "the inset ( b ) renders the normalized spp propagation length , @xmath118 and the nw field modulus @xmath119 , together with its @xmath2- and @xmath0-polarization components , all of them normalized to @xmath120.,width=302 ]    at distances large enough so that , due to the absorption , the spp is sufficiently damped , the contributions from spp and nw are comparable , see inset ( b ) in fig .",
    "this typically occurs at @xmath121 , with @xmath122 being the spp propagation length . in the vicinity of @xmath107 , the spp and nw fields have similar amplitudes ,",
    "so the modulus of their sum presents an interference behavior , leading to a set of maxima and minima .",
    "notice that , in the optical region the spp wavevector is close to the light cone , thus close to the nw one .",
    "however , @xmath123 largely increases close frequencies such that @xmath114 ( which , for good metals , occur at @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the plasma frequency ) , in which case the total field given by eq .   presents a fanciful two - scaled oscillatory behavior .",
    "the third region is located beyond @xmath107 , where the contribution from the spp field is negligible ( see inset ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the field then reaches its asymptotic behavior , which is given by the nw , oscillating with the spatial period given by the free - space wavelength and decaying algebraically as @xmath70 .",

    "fig .   shows the spatial dependencies of the fields in the direction perpendicular to the slit for different @xmath73 .",
    "there are two tendencies with the increase of @xmath73 : the amplitude of the field decreases , and the crossover distance @xmath107 diminishes .",
    "to explain this behavior , we represent @xmath107 as a function of @xmath73 ( inset ( a ) to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . as can be seen from the curves where @xmath107 is normalized to the constant ( @xmath62independent ) value @xmath126 , the distance after which the nw dominates decreases as @xmath73 increases . however , the value of @xmath117 increases as @xmath73 increases , meaning that the crossover occurs at smaller absolute distances , but at larger spp propagation lengths , specially close to @xmath127 .    the inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the nw amplitude as a function of @xmath73 .",
    "this behavior is due to the dependence with @xmath73 of the space - independent prefactors in the amplitude of the nw ( which for @xmath128 , goes as @xmath129 , and thus decreases as @xmath73 increases ) .",
    "by contrast , in the case of a spp this prefactor is practically independent of @xmath73 .",
    "however , the spp propagation length scales as @xmath130 , so the spp decays faster for larger values of @xmath73 . as a result , as @xmath73 increases , the nw overtakes the spp closer to the slit , but with a smaller amplitude .    as follows from eqs .",
    ", , the @xmath0-polarization component of the nw has a non - monotonic dependency upon @xmath73 , @xmath131 .",
    "nonetheless , the contribution of this component is always much smaller than that from @xmath2-polarization ( see inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "notice that , as the nw presents the same algebraic decay for all @xmath73 ( @xmath132 ) , the normalization to @xmath120 makes the quantities represented in the inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] independent upon distance .",
    "thus , even for oblique incidence , nws are virtually @xmath2-polarized waves along the interface , i.e. , present the same polarization as spps .     upon distance from the slit for different values of @xmath73 .",
    "the wavelength is @xmath103 nm and the considered metal is gold.,width=302 ]    it is also interesting to study the ratio @xmath133 , i.e. the polarization of the tangential - to - the - interface component of the field . for the case of in - plane launching ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath134 , and the field in the plane of the metal surface",
    "has only @xmath22-component .",
    "when the excited waveguide mode gains non - zero momentum in the direction along slit , the scattered electric field possesses a finite @xmath12-component in both far- and near - field regions .",
    "[ fig5 ] illustrates the spatial dependency of @xmath135 for different @xmath73 , showing that this ratio increases with @xmath73 .",
    "according to eqs .",
    ", for a spp the ratio @xmath133 scales as @xmath136 . for a nw , from eq .   and neglecting the contribution from the @xmath0-polarization ( which scales as @xmath137 ) , it follows that this ratio scales in a similar way : @xmath138 .",
    "notice that crossover distance is slightly different for @xmath22 and @xmath12-components of the electric field and , also , that the amplitudes of @xmath139 and @xmath140 are different at the crossover . for these reasons , the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] present dips at distances close to the corresponding crossovers , where both @xmath139 and @xmath140 are strongly suppressed , but @xmath140 dominates .",
    "to conclude , in this paper we have presented the asymptotic expression for the em field along the metal interface , launched by a subwavelength slit in the conical mount .",
    "these expressions are very accurate for the region down to a tenth of a wavelength .",
    "the field presents different contributions , which can be assigned to specific regions in the angular spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0-polarization component , although present for oblique incidence , not influence significantly the behavior of the field .",
    "we have studied the dependencies of the fields upon angle of incidence ( i.e. , component of the em wavevector along the slit axis ) . in the far field region ,",
    "the distance from the slit at which the algebraic behavior of the field overcomes the exponential decay decreases as @xmath73 increases .",
    "this could favor experimental studies of the norton waves .",
