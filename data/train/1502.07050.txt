    "the quality of cvd - grown films is inferior to those produced by exfoliation , since gas phase deposition leads to simultaneous growth of graphene flakes that eventually interconnect , forming grain boundaries with a defective , haeckelite - like structure  @xcite consisting of non - hexagonal carbon rings  @xcite .",
    "pure haeckelite structures and their hybrids with graphene have a significantly lower thermal conductivity than pure graphene  @xcite .",

    "most theoretical studies have focused on the equilibrium structure , stability and growth stability of haeckelites   and found these systems to be either metallic , semi - metallic or semiconducting  @xcite .    with continuing interest in cvd - grown graphene as an electronic material , increased attention must be given to carrier scattering at haeckelite - like grain boundaries connecting defect - free graphene regions .",
