    "neutrinos are unique astronomical messengers",
    ". the observation of extra - galactic high energy astrophysical neutrinos would imply a hadronic origin of cosmic rays .",
    "moreover , unlike photons or charged particles , they travel across the universe without deflection by interstellar magnetic fields or absorption by intervening matter . existing and upcoming neutrino detectors ( see for example  @xcite ) are expected to eventually observe high - energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei , gamma ray bursts , gzk processes and other feasible sources .",
    "high - energy cosmic neutrinos are also unique messengers of physics of and beyond the standard model . with a typical baseline of inter - galactic scales ,",
    "neutrinos propagate incoherently such that the transition probabilities between the flavor eigenstates are described only by the elements of the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "the flavor composition at the earth thus carries important information on the lepton flavor structure  @xcite , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "furthermore , the long baselines and high energies allow for interesting discussions of exotic possibilities such as neutrino decay  @xcite , pseudo - dirac neutrinos @xcite , lorentz and cpt violation  @xcite , which may show an effect in flavor ratio deformations of the diffuse spectrum  @xcite .    since the ultra - high energy neutrinos span a wide range of energies , they can be sensitive to the glashow resonance ( gr )  @xcite , which refers to the resonant formation of an intermediate @xmath12 in @xmath13 collision at the anti - neutrino energy @xmath14 gev .",
    "this is a particularly interesting process  @xcite , unique in its sensitivity to only anti - neutrinos . in particular , because the relative @xmath15 content of @xmath4 and @xmath16 collision final states is very different , the question of which of these two processes lie at the origin of high energy neutrinos can , in principle , be tested well with gr events .",
    "indeed , earlier works have focused mainly on the resonance detection via shower events and on how the gr can be used as a discriminator of the relative abundance of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 sources .",
    "our emphasis in this work is not just on the detectability of the resonance itself , but also on its feasibility as a tool to detect the first extra - galactic diffuse neutrino signals .",
    "we recalculate expected gr event numbers and their dependence on the relative contribution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 sources .",
    "our work updates and generalizes the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . to calculate the number of events",
    ", we use the waxman ",
    "bahcall @xmath17 spectrum  @xcite as a benchmark neutrino spectrum .",
    "recently icecube , the construction of which has been completed in december 2010 with 86 strings , has improved the upper bound of the cosmic neutrino flux  @xcite .",
    "the current limits on the diffuse neutrino flux are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icecube - bounds ] .",
    "if the neutrino flux is to be observed , it is reasonable to assume that it will emerge above the atmospheric background while staying below the current experimental upper bounds .",
    "the present status of these limits leads us to believe that this is likely to happen at energies of @xmath18 gev or greater , close to region of the glashow resonance .",
    "therefore , it is useful and timely to revisit this resonance region carefully to reassess its potential as a tool to detect the cosmic diffuse neutrinos .",
    "in addition , we point out that there are two types of distinctive resonant processes besides the standard shower signatures from @xmath19 and @xmath20 considered in the literature .",
    "we call these new signatures `` pure muon '' and `` contained lollipop '' events .",
    "a pure muon event occurs when only a muon track ( and nothing else ) is created inside the detector volume by the resonant process @xmath21 .",
    "we sketch the signature in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] . unlike the neutrino ",
    "nucleon charged current scattering @xmath22 ( and its charge conjugated counterpart ) , the pure muon track is not accompanied by any shower activity at its starting point .",
    "we note that in @xmath22 processes with pev neutrino energies , about @xmath23% of the initial neutrino energy is transfered to the kicked quark , which turns into a hadronic cascade  @xcite .",
    "thus , a muon track from @xmath22 is accompanied by a @xmath24 radius shower at the interaction vertex for @xmath25 neutrino energies .",
    "this is clearly distinguishable from the muons of the pure muon event @xmath2 .",
    "a possible background against this signal is the non - resonant electroweak process @xmath26 .",
    "the cross section is however three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath27 at the resonant energy .",
    "the pure muon is therefore essentially background free in the neighborhood of the resonance energy and even one event implies discovery of the resonance and signals the presence of diffuse extra - galactic flux .",
    "a contained lollipop event occurs for @xmath28 : a tau is created and decays inside the detector with a sufficient length of the tau track , see fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "again , due to the lack of shower activity at the initial vertex , the contained lollipop is also clearly separated from the standard double bang  @xcite signature induced by the @xmath29 charged current scattering , and it is therefore also essentially free from background .",
    "+    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ x - sec ] , we briefly review the cross sections associated with the gr , in section  [ flux ] , we discuss the expected neutrino flux for @xmath4 and @xmath5 sources , keeping their relative flux ratio as a free parameter . in section",
    "[ event ] , the event rate and the signal - to - background ratio are studied , and finally , conclusions are presented in section  [ conc ] .",
    "ultra - high energy electron anti - neutrinos allow the resonant formation of @xmath12 in their interactions with electrons , at @xmath30 pev .",
    "this process , known as the glashow resonance  @xcite has , in the resonance energy band , several notably high cross - sections for the allowed decay channels of the @xmath12 . in particular , the differential cross - section for @xmath2 is given by @xmath31 and , for hadrons one may write @xmath32 the above expressions hold in the lab frame where @xmath33 electron mass , @xmath34 muon mass , @xmath35 mass , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the total width of the @xmath38 .",
    "table  [ tab1 ]  @xcite lists the total cross - sections at @xmath39 pev .",
    "we note that for the leptonic final states , one expects ( very nearly ) equal cross - sections regardless of whether one produces @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 .    in the right panel of table  [ tab1 ]",
    "we list , also at @xmath43 pev , the possible non - resonant interactions which could provide backgrounds to the interactions listed in the left panel of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we note that the total resonant cross - section , @xmath44 is about @xmath45 times higher than the total neutrino - nucleon cross - section , @xmath46 .",
    "the cross - section for @xmath47 is about @xmath48 times its non - resonant hadron producing background interaction @xmath46 .",
    "even the resonant leptonic final state interactions have cross - sections about 40 times that of the total @xmath49 cross - section .",
    "finally we note that the  pure - muon \" and  contained lollipop \" resonant processes discussed in the sec .  [ intro ] have negligible backgrounds .",
    "for example , the process @xmath50 ( pure muon ) has a cross - section about @xmath51 times higher than its non - resonant counterpart @xmath52 .",
    "given these considerations and the fact that the present bounds shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : icecube - bounds ] restrict observational diffuse fluxes to energies above @xmath18 gev ( _ i.e. _ , close to the gr region ) , the gr , in spite of its narrow span of energy , may be an important discovery tool for the yet to be observed extra - galactic diffuse neutrino spectrum .",
    ".resonant gr cross - sections for electron anti - neutrino  ( left panel ) and non - resonant  ( right panel ) interactions at @xmath53 pev .",

    "we have studied the glashow resonance in the high - energy astrophysical neutrino observatory icecube . besides the standard hadronic / electromagnetic cascade , the pure muon from @xmath2 and the contained lollipop signatures from @xmath28 were identified as clear signals of the resonance . applying a waxman - bahcall @xmath17 flux in agreement with recent limits ,",
    "the event numbers for general @xmath4 and @xmath5 sources were evaluated .",
    "if the neutrino fluxes are positioned with such intensities as presently conjectured , the confirmation of the resonance is possible with several years of data collection at icecube .",
