    "in quantum computation the concepts of quantum superposition states and quantum entanglement are crucial .",
    "we want to study quantum entanglement in the most simple case , namely a system consisting of two entangled spin @xmath3 the quantum entity consisting of two entangled spin @xmath4 is described in the tensor product of the two dimensional complex hilbert spaces that describe the single spins .",
    "let us refer to the first spin as the ` left spin ' and to the second spin as the ` right spin ' .",
    "it is well known that for the two spins being in the singlet state , the typical epr correlations are encountered , meaning that if the left spin collapses in a certain direction under the influence of a measurement , then the right spin collapses in the opposite direction .    our aim is to study in detail the entanglement for an arbitrary tensor product state that is not necessarily the singlet state , by making use of the sphere model representation for the spin of a spin @xmath5 particle that was developed in brussels within the ` hidden measurement approach ' to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "we do this by introducing ` constraint functions ' that describe the behavior of the state of one of the spins if measurements are executed on the other spin .",
    "we will consider two types of measurements : ( 1 ) noncollapse measurements , of which the action on a mixture of states is described by luder s formula , and ( 2 ) collapse measurements , of which the action is described by von neumann s formula .",
    "we will show that ( 1 ) an arbitrary noncollapse measurement on one of the two spins does not provoke any change in the partial trace density matrix of the other spin , i.e. , the spins behave as separated entities for noncollapse measurements ; ( 2 ) an arbitrary collapse measurement on one spin provokes a rotation and a stretching on the other spin , which can be described in detail by means of the sphere model .",
    "in the sphere model representation a ray state of the spin is represented by a point of a sphere with radius 1 in the three dimensional real space @xmath6 , such that the direction of the point towards the origin of the sphere coincides with the direction of the spin in three dimensional space as measured for example by a stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "let us denote the point @xmath7 of @xmath6 by the vector @xmath8 .",
    "the ray state @xmath9 vector of @xmath10 , is then represented by @xmath11 vector of @xmath6 , and point of the sphere with radius 1 and center in @xmath12 .",
    "we remark that this part of our sphere model is nothing else but the well known poincar representation of @xmath10 .",
    "a density state of the spin is represented by an interior point of the sphere , which is a convex linear combination of points of the surface of the sphere , in such a way that the weights of the convex combination coincide with the weights of the statistical mixture that corresponds with the density state .",
    "it is not difficult to calculate the density state @xmath13 that corresponds with an arbitrary interior point , @xmath8 , @xmath0,\\theta \\in [ 0,\\pi ] , \\phi \\in [ 0,2\\pi ] $ ] , of the sphere .    to do this we remark that also a ray state has a density representation , where in this case the density matrix is the orthogonal projection on the ray .",
    "this means that the density matrix representing the ray state @xmath14 is given by : @xmath15 the ray state orthogonal to @xmath16 is @xmath17 , and this state is represented by the point @xmath18 of the sphere , corresponding to the opposite spin direction .",
    "we have : @xmath19 to find the general representation for @xmath8 we remark that the center of the sphere , hence the point @xmath20 , can be written as the convex combination @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the density matrix that represent the center of the sphere is given by : @xmath22 we further have that : @xmath23 and hence : @xmath24 which gives us the representation of a general density state @xmath25 by means of the interior point @xmath8 of the sphere ( see figure 1 ) .     by means of the interior point @xmath8 of the sphere . ]",
    "we can see that the part of the sphere model that we developed in brussels that relates to the representation of the density and ray states of the spin , is the bloch representation .",
    "additionally to this state part of the representation , we however also developed a representation for the measurements in our sphere model .",
    "before we explain the way in which measurements are represented , let us identify some of the special points of this sphere representation .",
    "we have seen already that the center of the sphere , hence the point @xmath26 represents that density state @xmath27 the north pole of the sphere , hence the point @xmath28 , represents the state @xmath29 which is the orthogonal projector on the first canonical base vector @xmath30 of @xmath10 , while the south of the sphere , hence the point @xmath31 , represents the state @xmath32 which is the orthogonal projector on the second canonical base vector @xmath33 of @xmath10 .",
    "an arbitrary point of the straight line connecting the north pole with the south pole of the sphere , hence @xmath34 or @xmath35 , represents the density states @xmath36    without loss of generality we can demonstrate the effect of a measurement by considering states that are on the straight line connecting the north and the south pole of the sphere .",
    "so , suppose that the spin is in density state @xmath37 , and that a measurement of the spin is executed with a stern gerlach apparatus in the direction @xmath38 .",
    "quantum mechanics prescribes the way , by means of luder s formula , in which we calculate the density state of the spin after this measurement .",
    "@xmath39 where @xmath40 is the projector on the ray state @xmath41 .",
    "we know that @xmath42 .",
    "if we make this calculation we find @xmath43 let us see which point of the sphere corresponds with this density state . to do this ,",
    "let us first suppose that @xmath44 $ ] . in this case we can introduce @xmath45 and we have @xmath46 this means that for @xmath44 $ ] we have that @xmath37 transform into @xmath47 , if a measurement with a stern gerlach in direction @xmath48 is executed .",
    "consider now the case where @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "we can put then @xmath50 and find @xmath51 which means that for @xmath49 $ ] the density state @xmath37 transforms into @xmath52 , if a measurement with stern gerlach in direction @xmath48 is executed .",
    "if we consider the sphere we can see easily that in both cases the point @xmath53 is transformed into the point @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the scalar product in @xmath6 of the vectors @xmath53 and @xmath38 .",
    "this means that we have identified a very simple mechanics to describe the quantum measurement effect in our sphere model .",
    "the effect is just an ordinary orthogonal projection on the direction of the stern gerlach apparatus of the point that represents that ray or density state of the spin in the sphere model ( see figure 2 ) .    .",
    "]    let us formulate the general case .",
    "suppose that we have a spin state represented by the point @xmath56 and we perform a measurement with a stern gerlach apparatus in direction @xmath48 .",
    "we denote the orthogonal projection on the straight line with direction @xmath48 in @xmath6 by @xmath57 .",
    "then the new state after a quantum mechanical measurement with stern gerlach in direction @xmath48 , when the state of the spin before the measurement is represented in the sphere model by the point @xmath56 , is given by @xmath58 and we have @xmath59 \\\\ e(\\theta , \\phi ) u(s,\\alpha , \\beta ) & = & u(s\\cos ( \\pi -\\theta ) , \\pi -\\theta , \\phi + \\pi ) \\ \\mathrm{if}\\ |\\alpha -\\theta |\\in [ { \\frac \\pi 2},\\pi ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is possible to give a nice geometrical presentation of how the spin state changes under the influence of measurements in different directions ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "consider a little sphere inside the big sphere of the model , such that the north pole of the little sphere is in the point @xmath56 , the point that represents the spin state , and the south pole is in the center of the big sphere .",
    "consider now a straight line with direction @xmath48 through the center of the big sphere , representing the direction of the stern gerlach apparatus .",
    "the point where this line cuts the little sphere is the point where the spin state will be transformed to under influence of the measurement .",
    "this also means that the points of the little sphere are the points that represent the states where under arbitrary angles for the measurement the spin state can be transformed to .",
    "the entity consisting of two entangled spin @xmath60 is described by means of the tensorproduct @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are two copies of @xmath64 , that we label with indices @xmath65 and @xmath66 with the sole purpose of identifying them .",
    "this means that the ray states of this entangled spin @xmath60 entity are described by the rays of @xmath61 and the density states by the density matrices of @xmath61 .",
    "suppose that we consider an arbitrary unit vector @xmath67 .",
    "then it is always possible to write @xmath68 as the sum of product vectors @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are a bases respectively of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "let us consider a measurement on the first spin .",
    "this measurement provokes the first spin to collapse with a certain probability into a spin state described by a unit vector @xmath75 .",
    "the state @xmath68 of the entangled spins is transformed in the state @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the orthogonal projector of @xmath73 on @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the unit operator of @xmath74 .",
    "the result is that the entangled spins end up in a product state that is the following : @xmath80 this means that as a consequence of the spin measurement on the first spin , making its state collapse in the state @xmath78 , the spin state of the second spin collapses to the state @xmath81 in an analogous way we can show that if a measurement is performed on the second spin that makes its state collapse to the state described by the unit vector @xmath82 , the state of the first spin collapses to the state described by the vector @xmath83    let us consider the functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 defined in the following way @xmath86 we call @xmath84 and @xmath85 the constraint functions related to @xmath68 .",
    "these constraint functions map the unit vectors describing the state where the entangled spin collapses to by a measurement on one of the spins to the vector describing the state that the other spin collapses to under influence of the entanglement correlation .",
    "a detailed study of the constraint functions can give us a complete picture of how the entanglement correlation works as an internal constraint .",
    "before we arrive at this complete picture , let us proof some properties of the constraint functions that we need to derive the picture .",
    "the constraint functions are canonically defined    proof : indeed , consider other bases @xmath87 of @xmath73 , and @xmath88 of @xmath74 , such that @xmath89 we have @xmath90 and hence @xmath91 from this follows that @xmath92 hence we have @xmath93 which proves that the definition of @xmath84 does not depend on the chosen bases . in an analogous way we prove that @xmath85 is canonically defined .",
    "@xmath94    the constraint functions are conjugate linear    proof : consider @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we have @xmath97 the conjugate linearity of @xmath98 is proven in an analogous way @xmath99    let us calculate @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the partial trace density matrix to @xmath73 and @xmath104 is the partial trace density matrix to @xmath74 .",
    "proof : let us first calculate @xmath103 directly .",
    "we have @xmath105 and hence @xmath106 this means that @xmath107 let us now calculate @xmath108 .",
    "we have @xmath109 this proves that @xmath110 in an analogous way we prove @xmath111 @xmath94    the constraint functions are related in the following way . for @xmath75 and @xmath82",
    "we have @xmath112    proof : we have @xmath113 and @xmath114 @xmath94    to derive a complete view of how the entanglement between the two spins works as an internal constraint , let us derive the way in which the schmidt diagonal form is related to the constraint functions .",
    "it is always possible to choose a base in @xmath73 and a base in @xmath74 such that @xmath68 becomes very simple .",
    "this special form for @xmath68 is often called the schmidt diagonalization form .",
    "let us explain how this works . since @xmath103 is a density matrix , it is of the form    @xmath115    we choose the base @xmath116 then in this new base , we have @xmath117 define now @xmath118 we have then : @xmath119 and @xmath120 similarly , one can show that @xmath121 and @xmath122 hence this shows that @xmath123 , respectively @xmath124 is a normalized eigenvector of @xmath104 with eigenvalue @xmath125 respectively @xmath126 . from this",
    "follows that @xmath104 has the form @xmath127 in the base @xmath128 .",
    "let us write now @xmath68 in the base @xmath129 of @xmath130 , hence @xmath131 we have then @xmath132 which shows that @xmath133 and hence @xmath134 which is the schmidt diagonal form of @xmath68 adapted to our sphere model of the spin @xmath5 .",
    "let us now see what the result of a non collapse measurement is on the density state , using luder s formula .",
    "let us write the state in the schmidt diagonalization form : @xmath135 and choose coordinates such that @xmath136 in @xmath137 and @xmath138 in @xmath139 the density state @xmath140 corresponding with the pure state @xmath141 is given by : @xmath142 the projector operator for a measurement along direction @xmath143 is given by @xmath144 i.e. , @xmath145 and its orthogonal by @xmath146 i.e. , @xmath147 to obtain the density state @xmath148 after a non collapse measurement we use luder s formula , with the following result : @xmath149    from this , we can calculate @xmath150 i.e. , the partial trace density matrix to @xmath73 and we obtain @xmath151 this is the same density matrix as we found for a measurement on a single spin @xmath3    also , we can calculate @xmath152 i.e. , the partial trace density matrix to @xmath74 and we find : @xmath153 which is independent of @xmath154 this means that a noncollapse measurement on one spin does not provoke any change in the partial trace density matrix of the other spin : the spins behave as separated entities for noncollapse measurements .",
    "let us now study the effect of a non collapse measurement using the constraint functions .",
    "again , the state @xmath68 is written in the schmidt diagonalization form : @xmath135 with @xmath155,$ ] and we use @xmath156 respectively @xmath157 , as basis for @xmath158 respectively @xmath159 .",
    "these two orthonormal basis are related by the following expressions : @xmath160 which in the sphere representation means that the north pole of the first sphere is mapped onto the north pole of the second sphere , and the south pole of the first sphere is mapped to the south pole of the second sphere ( in the bases @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) .",
    "let us now study the mapping @xmath84 for the other states . from ( [ x21 ] ) and ( [ x22 ] ) it follows immediately that @xmath84 does not preserve the norm .",
    "let us calculate the norm of @xmath163 for an arbitrary vector @xmath164 : @xmath165 if we consider for a moment the angle @xmath166 as a variable , we see that the square of the norm varies between @xmath167 and @xmath168 , depending on the value of @xmath166 . for @xmath169 , and hence the state represented by the north pole of the sphere , we have : @xmath170 and for @xmath171 , and hence the state represented by the south pole of the sphere , we have : @xmath172    not only the norm , but also orthogonality is in general not conserved by @xmath84 .",
    "let us consider for example an orthonormal base @xmath173 .",
    "we can use the conjugate linearity of @xmath84 to obtain :    @xmath174    therefore , for @xmath175 we find that orthogonal states are mapped onto orthogonal states iff :    @xmath176    translated on the sphere this gives that diametrical opposite points are mapped to diametrical opposite points only in the special case @xmath177 ( except the north and south pole which are always mapped onto the north and south pole of the second sphere ) .",
    "we consider now the following situation .",
    "take vector @xmath178 representing the point @xmath179 on the sphere .",
    "consider now : @xmath180 which is the normalized vector .",
    "this means that there are @xmath181 and @xmath182 such that : @xmath183 we want to find out where the corresponding point @xmath184 lies on the sphere .",
    "therefore we compare the inproduct of @xmath185 with @xmath123 with the inproduct of @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "we have : @xmath188 only in the case when @xmath189 ( i.e. , the singlet state ) we have that the inproducts are equal ( and consequently , antipodal points on the sphere are mapped to antipodal points , as mentioned before ) .",
    "an interesting case is when @xmath190 .",
    "then we find : @xmath191 and @xmath192 to see what this gives on the sphere , we use the following formula : @xmath193 for @xmath194 ( hence @xmath195 ) and @xmath196 .",
    "so we get : @xmath197 and as a consequence : @xmath198 this means that on the sphere , the elements of the equator are mapped onto a cone that makes an angle @xmath199 with the north south axis of the second sphere , such that : @xmath200 and indeed , only for @xmath189 this is again an equator ( and hence conserving the angle between the elements of the equator and the north pole ) . for @xmath201 0,1\\right [ $ ]",
    "we get a cone with an angle @xmath202 , which means that the equator has ` raised ' to the north . for @xmath203 approaching @xmath65 the sphere",
    "is stretched more and more to the north pole of the second sphere .",
    "remember that in this limit case the superposition state becomes a product state , and this fits with the fact that for product states indeed the map @xmath84 @xmath204maps the first element of the product to the second .    to see the general scheme we use    @xmath205    in the relation ( [ productrelation ] )",
    "to obtain : @xmath206 which yields @xmath207    from formula ( [ endresult ] ) it follows that straight lines through the center of the left sphere are mapped onto straight lines through the point @xmath208 along the north south axis in the second sphere , which gives a nice geometrical representation of this ` stretching ' on the second sphere ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "this also shows that indeed only for @xmath189 antipodal points of the first sphere are mapped onto antipodal points of the second sphere .     along the north south axis in the second sphere .",
    "we have studied the quantum entity consisting of two entangled spin @xmath209 which in standard quantum mechanics is described in the tensor product of the two dimensional complex hilbert spaces that describe the single spins .",
    "we have introduced ` constraint functions ' that describe the behavior of the state of one of the spins if measurements are executed on the other spin . by making use of the sphere model representation for the spin @xmath4 s that was developed in brussels , we studied in detail the entanglement for an arbitrary tensor product state , which is not necessarily the singlet state .",
    "we considered two types of measurements : ( 1 ) noncollapse measurements , of which the action on a mixture of states is described by luder s formula , and ( 2 ) collapse measurements , of which the action is described by von neumann s formula .",
    "our result is that ( 1 ) an arbitrary noncollapse measurement on one spin does not provoke any change in the partial trace density matrix of the other spin : the spins behave as separated entities for noncollapse measurements ; ( 2 ) an arbitrary collapse measurement on one spin provokes a rotation and a ` stretching ' on the other spin , which gives a nice geometrical representation of how entanglement works as an internal constraint .",
    "we conclude by remarking that our study is a further elaboration of earlier studies of the entanglement influence as constraint , more specifically to be found in @xcite .",
