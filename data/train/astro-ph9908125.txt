    "jura ( 1991 ) measured the far - ir excess of this wide binary using _ iras _ data .",
    "jura ( 1995 , 1998 ) associated the excess with the a0 primary and derived the ratio of the far - ir to stellar luminosity , @xmath1 @xmath2 . in 1998 , two groups reported extended thermal emission at @xmath3 = 20 @xmath4 m from a dusty disk with an inner hole at @xmath0 4070 au assuming the _ hipparcos _ distance of 67 @xmath5 3.5 pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "kenyon & luu ( 1999 ; kl99 hereafter ) estimate formation times of 1040 myr for pluto at 35 au from the sun . achieving shorter timescales at 70 au in hr",
    "4796a requires large initial masses , which might conflict with masses derived from ir observations . in the inner solar system",
    ", planet formation can not be confined to a narrow ring , because high velocity objects in adjacent annuli interact and ` mix ' planetary growth over a large area ( @xcite ) .",
    "this problem may be reduced at larger distances from the central star , where planetary growth is `` calmer '' .",
    "our goal in this paper is to develop planetesimal accretion models that can lead to the dusty ring observed in hr 4796a .",
    "we begin in  2 with monte carlo calculations to constrain the geometry and optical depth of dust in the ring . in  3 , we derive plausible initial conditions which produce the observed dust distribution on 10 myr timescales .",
    "these models also satisfy constraints on the dust mass from _ iras _ observations and lead to a self - consistent picture for ring formation .",
    "we conclude in  4 with a brief summary and discussion of the implications of this study for planet formation in other star systems .",
    "current data constrain the geometry and optical depth of the ring .",
    "near - ir images measure the amount of scattered light from the ratio of the 1.11.6 @xmath4 m radiation to the stellar luminosity , @xmath9 @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the far - ir luminosity limits the amount of stellar radiation absorbed and reradiated . to construct a physical model ,",
    "we assume an annulus of width @xmath11 and height @xmath12 at a distance @xmath13 = 70 au from the central star .",
    "the luminosity ratios depend on the solid angle @xmath14 , the radial optical depth @xmath15 , and the albedo @xmath16 : @xmath17 = @xmath18 and @xmath19 = @xmath20 .",
    "these equations assume gray opacity and scattering in the geometric optics limit . if the annulus contains planetesimals and dust in dynamical equilibrium , @xmath21 1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "anticipating the results of our coagulation calculations , where @xmath22 @xmath23 , we then have @xmath24 0.3  close to observed values in @xmath7 pic ( @xcite )  and @xmath25 1 .",
    "we construct scattered light images using a 3d monte carlo code ( @xcite ) with forced first scattering ( witt 1977 ) and a `` peeling - off '' procedure ( yusef - zadeh , morris , & white 1984 ) .",
    "we adopt a dust number density , @xmath26 , where the scale height @xmath27 and scale length @xmath28 are in au .",

    "model images with @xmath30 = constant are identical in the optically thin limit .",
    "figure 1 compares several models with the nicmos 1.1 @xmath4 m image ( from fits data kindly sent by g. schneider ) .",
    "we convolved monte carlo images with a gaussian point - spread function with fwhm = 012 to approximate the 012 resolution of nicmos ( @xcite ) .",
    "model images with @xmath31 5 au ( fwhm = 14 au ) or @xmath32 10 au ( fwhm = 27 au ) are more extended than the data ( @xcite ) . our preferred model with @xmath33 au , @xmath34 au , and @xmath30 = 0.25 reproduces the size and shape of the nicmos image as well as the limb brightening observed towards the ring edges .",
    "these results match nicmos flux ratios best for our adopted geometry ; larger @xmath27 implies smaller @xmath30 .",
    "the 3@xmath35 limit , @xmath30 = 0.120.35 , agrees with previous estimates ( cf .",

    "we disagree , however , with the @xmath36 of schneider _ et al . _ ; their result is valid only for scattering in a spherical shell .",
    "to calculate dust evolution in hr 4976a , we use a coagulation code based on the particle - in - a - box method ( @xcite ) .",
    "this formalism treats planetesimals as a statistical ensemble of bodies with a distribution of horizontal and vertical velocities about keplerian orbits ( @xcite ) .",
    "we begin with a size distribution of @xmath37 bodies having total mass @xmath38 in each of @xmath39 mass batches .",
    "collisions among these bodies produce ( i ) growth through mergers along with cratering debris for low impact velocities or ( ii ) catastrophic disruption into numerous small fragments for high impact velocities .",
    "inelastic collisions , long range gravitational interactions ( dynamical friction and viscous stirring ) , and gas drag change the velocities of the mass batches with time . the code has been tested against analytic solutions of the coagulation equation and published calculations of planetesimal growth .",
    "although inappropriate for the last stages of planet formation , our approach well - approximates the early stages ( @xcite ) .",
    "we model planetesimal growth in an annulus of width @xmath11 = 12 au centered at @xmath13 = 70 au .",
    "the central star has a mass of 2.5 .",
    "the input size distribution has equal mass in each of 38 mass batches with initial radii @xmath40 = 180 m. for a minimum mass solar nebula with mass @xmath41 , the total mass in the annulus is @xmath42 15 @xmath43 ; the initial number of bodies with @xmath40 = 1",
    "m is @xmath44 .",
    "all batches start with the same initial velocity .",
    "the mass density @xmath45 = 1.5 g @xmath46 , intrinsic strength @xmath47 @xmath48 erg g@xmath49 , and other bulk properties of the grains are adopted from earlier work ( see kl99 ) .",
    "planetesimal growth at 70 au follows the evolution described previously ( kl99 ) .",
    "the 80 m bodies first grow slowly into 1  km objects . during this slow growth phase ,",
    "frequent collisions damp the velocity dispersion of all bodies .",
    "`` runaway growth '' begins when the gravitational range of large objects exceeds their geometric cross - section .",
    "these bodies grow from 1  km up to @xmath0 100 km in several myr . during runaway growth , collisional debris , dynamical friction , and viscous stirring increase the velocity dispersion of small bodies from @xmath0 1  m  s@xmath49 up to @xmath0 40  m  s@xmath49 .",
    "this evolution reduces the gravitational range of the 100  km objects and ends runaway growth .",

    "models with smaller @xmath50 take longer to make `` pluto '' . plutos form more quickly for @xmath54 , because gravitational focusing factors are larger .",

    "collisional damping cools the bodies during the slow - growth phase ; @xmath27 remains small .",
    "@xmath27 increases dramatically during runaway growth , when dynamical processes heat up the smallest bodies .",
    "once runaway growth ends , @xmath27 slowly increases to 0.30.6 au independent of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and other input parameters .    when @xmath27 begins to increase , high velocity collisions",
    "produce numerous `` dust grains '' with sizes @xmath57 1 m. we do not follow explicitly the evolution of these bodies . instead , we assume that collisional debris is ( i ) swept up by 1 m or larger objects , ( ii ) ejected by radiation pressure , or ( iii ) dragged inwards by the poynting - robertson effect .",
    "grains with sizes exceeding 45 @xmath4 m are stable against radiation pressure ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "poynting - robertson drag reduces the mass in small grains on a timescale @xmath58 1.0 myr ( @xmath59 m ) . with the short collision times",
    ", @xmath60 yr , in our model annulus , 1 myr seems a reasonable estimate of the timescale for collisions to produce 4 @xmath4 m grains which are removed by radiative processes . for this paper",
    ", we calculate the accretion explicitly and adopt a 1 myr timescale for dust removal .",
    "figure 2(c ) shows the dust mass as a function of time .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the adopted mass distribution for grains with @xmath61 4 @xmath4 m or to factor of 23 variations in the removal timescale .",
    "the dust mass is initially large due to the starting conditions",
    ". the dust mass decreases with time , because ( i ) collisional damping of the smaller bodies leads to less collisional debris and ( ii ) radiative processes and accretion by large bodies remove dust .",
    "once runaway growth begins , collisions between small bodies produce more dust .",
    "the dust mass then reaches a rough equilibrium between collision debris and dust removed by radiation forces and by the larger bodies .",
    "these results indicate that large dust masses correlate with runaway growth and the formation of 1 or more plutos in the outer parts of the disk .",
    "to predict the amount of radiation absorbed and scattered by dust and larger bodies , we compute @xmath15 from the model size distribution . we assume the geometric optics limit because @xmath62 . for the large bodies @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number density in mass batch @xmath39 , @xmath65 is the extinction cross - section , and @xmath66 is the number of mass batches . we adopt @xmath67 and a volume @xmath68 to compute @xmath69 and hence @xmath15 for material with @xmath61 1 m.    estimating @xmath15 for small particles requires an adopted cumulative size distribution , @xmath70 .",
    "we consider three choices : ( i ) @xmath71 , the collisional limit for coagulation ; ( ii ) @xmath72 , equal mass per mass interval ; and ( iii ) @xmath73 , the approximate distribution for grains in the interstellar medium .",
    "our calculations produce @xmath74 for 1100 m bodies .",
    "we expect a slightly steeper mass distribution for smaller bodies , because collisions between smaller bodies produce fewer mergers and more debris .",
    "figure 2(d ) shows how @xmath15 evolves for a single model .",
    "the large bodies initially have modest radial optical depth , @xmath75 0.2 .",
    "this optical depth decreases with time , except for a brief period when runaway growth produces 10100 km objects with small scale height above the disk midplane .",
    "the large bodies are transparent once a pluto forms .",
    "the small grains are also initially opaque .",
    "this dust is transparent at late times if most of the mass is in the largest grains , @xmath76 2.8 .",
    "the dust is opaque for @xmath77 3 .    table 1 summarizes results for various initial conditions . models with @xmath42 1020 @xmath41 and @xmath78 @xmath79@xmath52 achieve @xmath80 in 10 myr .",
    "less massive disks produce less dust on longer timescales .",
    "the results are not sensitive to other input parameters , including the size distribution and the bulk properties of the bodies",
    ".    table 1 also shows why dust in hr 4796a lies in a ring . in disks with surface density @xmath81 , the pluto formation timescale which produces large dust masses . ]",
    "is @xmath82 13 myr @xmath83 @xmath84 .",
    "once an annulus at @xmath13 begins to form dust , material at @xmath85 must wait a time , @xmath86 , to reach the same state .",
    "this result sets a hard outer limit to the ring , @xmath87 0.10.2 , if @xmath88 is the time for @xmath27 to double in size during runaway growth , 23 myr .",
    "we expect a hard inner edge , because particle velocities reach the shattering limit of @xmath0 100 m s@xmath49",
    "( kl99 ) or planets sweep up the dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) or both .",
    "our results indicate that the dusty ring in hr 4796a is a natural outcome of planetesimal evolution .",
    "planet formation at 70 au in 10 myr is possible with an initial disk mass of 1020 @xmath41 .",
    "dust production associated with planet formation is then confined to a ring with @xmath89 715 au .",
    "the optical depth in this ring satisfies current constraints on scattered light at 12 @xmath4 m and on thermal emission at 10100 @xmath4 m if the size distribution of the dust is @xmath70 with @xmath90 for @xmath91 1 m. models with disk masses smaller than 10 @xmath41 fail to produce planets and an observable dusty ring in 10 myr .",
    "an uncertainty in our model is the timescale to produce 180 m bodies from small dust grains in a turbulent , gaseous disk .",
    "cuzzi ( 1993 ) show that grains grow very rapidly once they decouple from eddies in the disk .",
    "the decoupling timescale depends on the unknown disk viscosity at 70 au .",
    "our model makes several observational predictions .",
    "we expect @xmath17 = constant for @xmath92 5 @xmath4 m ; current data are consistent with this prediction at the 1.5@xmath35 level .",
    "better measurements of the ring flux at @xmath93 1.6 @xmath4 m would test our optical depth assumptions and yield interesting constraints on grain properties .",
    "deep images at @xmath93 1020 @xmath4 m with high spatial resolution should detect material outside the ring .",
    "we predict @xmath94 0.1 in large bodies for @xmath95 80 au ; the surface brightness and temperature of this material should decrease markedly with radius .",
    "this material should have negligible mass in small objects , because coagulation concentrates mass in the largest objects when @xmath27 is small .",
    "we also expect a flux of dust grains into the central star , although we can not yet compare quantitative predictions with observations .",
    "future calculations of radiative processes within the ring will address this issue .    applying this hr 4796a model to other stars with circumstellar disks is challenging due to small number statistics and unfavorable circumstances .",
    "nearby companion stars probably influence the dynamics of dusty rings in hd 98800 and hd 141569 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in hr 4796a",
    ", the m - type companion lies well outside the ring radius and can not modify ring dynamics significantly .",
    "older systems like @xmath7 pic and @xmath8 lyr require time - dependent treatment of dust to allow the ring to spread with time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to incorporate this time - dependent behavior in future calculations to see whether the ring in hr 4796a can evolve into a debris disk ( as in e.g. @xmath7 pic and @xmath8 lyr ) on a timescale of 100200 myr .",
    "the main alternative to _ in situ _ ring formation at 70 au is migration of a planet formed at a smaller radius .",
    "weidenschilling & marzari ( 1996 ) show that gravitational interactions can scatter large objects into the outer disk in less than 1 myr .",
    "migration reduces the required ring mass by a factor of 10100 .",
    "however , the scattered body has a large eccentricity , @xmath96 .",
    "dynamical friction might circularize the orbit in 10 myr , but would induce large eccentricities in smaller bodies .",
    "the width of the dusty ring would probably exceed observational constraints .",
    "future calculations can address these issues .",
