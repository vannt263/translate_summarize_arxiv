    "the decay @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) provides unique information about the dynamics of the strong interactions .",
    "it has been a testing ground for such theories as current algebra , pcac , chiral perturbation theory(chpt ) .",
    "the study of this decay has a particular interest in view of new two - loop order ( @xmath18 ) calculations for k@xmath19 decays in chpt @xcite .",
    "the high - order chpt calculations make a definite prediction for the quadratic term in the vector @xmath20 form - factor and link the scalar @xmath21 form - factor linear and quadratic slopes to the @xmath22 corrections . in turn",
    ", @xmath22 is known to be crucial for the @xmath23 measurements .",
    "in fact , the latest measurements do not report any visible non - linearity in the form - factors @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a high - statistics measurement ( @xmath24  919k events ) of the dalitz plot density in this decay . the description of the experimental setup , trigger and reconstruction procedure can be found in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the current analysis is based on the high - statistics data collected during run in winter 2001 . in total ,",
    "332 m events were logged on tapes .",
    "this statistics is complemented by about 160 m mc events generated with geant3 @xcite monte carlo program .",
    "the mc generation includes a realistic description of the setup with decay volume entrance windows , tracking chambers windows , chambers gas mixtures , sense wires and cathode structures , erenkov counters mirrors and gas , the shower generation in em calorimeters , etc .",
    "the events with one charged track identified as electron and two or three additional showers in the electromagnetic calorimeter are selected for further processing .",
    "it was observed , that the main background contribution ( about 95%  of the background events ) is related to the decay @xmath25 , when the hadronic interaction of the charged pion simulates the electromagnetic shower in the calorimeter . following the method of angular selection used in our analysis of the @xmath26 decay @xcite",
    ", we choose the angle between the beam particle direction and the vector sum of momenta of the final state track and photons as the variable to perform signal - background separation .    the expected distribution over this angle is shown in fig.1 together with the real data .",
    "one can observe a clear background peak at small values and a good agreement of the data and monte - carlo .",
    "the cut value was selected in the region where the maximum of the function @xmath27 is reached .",
    "after that , the momenta of the final state particles were refined with 2c @xmath28 kinematic fit . only the convergence of the fit",
    "was required .",
    "the missing energy @xmath29 after 2c fit is shown in fig.2 .",
    "this variable should exhibit a strong peak at @xmath30 in the presence of noticeable background contributions .",
    "the complete absence of any enhancement at small values of the missing energy proofs the quality of the selection procedure .",
    "figure 1 : angle between the beam track and the vector sum of final state particles momenta .",
    "the points with errors are data and the solid histogram is mc .",
    "the shaded area shows the background contribution .",

    "the shaded area shows the surviving background contribution .",
    "the signal monte - carlo events for figures 1 and 2 are weighted with the @xmath31 matrix element where we use @xmath32 ( fixed from our preliminary measurements @xcite ) .    finally , 919k events were selected .",
    "we estimate the surviving background contribution to be around 2.1% .",
    "the most general lorentz - invariant form of the matrix element for the @xmath33 decay is @xcite : @xmath34\\gamma^{\\alpha } + i \\frac{2f_{t}}{m_{k } } \\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}p^{\\alpha}_{k}p^{\\beta}_{\\pi}]v(p_{l})\\ ] ] it consists of scalar , vector , and tensor terms .",
    "the @xmath35 form - factors are the functions of @xmath36 . in the standard model ( sm )",
    ", the w - boson exchange leads to the pure vector term .",
    "the scalar and/or tensor terms which are `` induced '' by ew radiative corrections are negligibly small , i.e nonzero scalar or tensor form - factors would indicate the physics beyond the sm .",
    "the term in the vector part , proportional to @xmath37 , is reduced ( using the dirac equation ) to the scalar form - factor . in the same way",
    ", the tensor term is reduced to a mixture of the scalar and vector form - factors .",
    "the redefined vector ( v ) and scalar ( s ) terms , and the corresponding dalitz plot density in the kaon rest frame ( @xmath38 ) are @xcite : @xmath39 with the selected number of events we can not neglect the @xmath40 interference term proportional to the electron mass .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath41 is neglected in our analysis .",
    "for further analysis we assume a general quadratic dependence of @xmath42 on t : @xmath43    the procedure of the extraction of the form - factor parameters starts with the subdivision of the dalitz plot region @xmath44 @xmath45 into @xmath46 bins .",
    "the signal mc was generated with the constant matrix element and the amplitude - induced weights should be calculated during the fit procedure .",
    "one can observe that the dalitz - plot density function @xmath47 in ( 2 ) can be presented in the factorisable form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are simple bilinear functions of the form - factor parameters and @xmath50 are the kinematic functions which are calculated from the mc - truth information . for each @xmath51 ,",
    "the sums of @xmath50 over events are accumulated in the dalitz plot bins ( i , j ) to which the mc events fall after the reconstruction .",
    "finally , every bin in the dalitz plot gets weights @xmath52 and the density function @xmath53 which enters into the fitting procedure is constructed : @xmath54    this method allows one to avoid the systematic errors due to the `` migration '' of the events over the dalitz plot due to the finite experimental resolution and automatically takes into account the efficiency of the reconstruction and selection procedures .    to take into account the finite number of mc events in the particular bin and strong variation of the real data events over the dalitz plot , we minimize a @xmath55 function defined as @xcite : @xmath56 + 2\\sum_j ( n_j+m_j+1)\\ln\\left ( \\frac{1+\\frac{r_j}{m_j}}{1+\\frac{n_j}{m_j+1}}\\right),\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all populated bins , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the number of data events , expected events and generated monte carlo events respectively . for large @xmath59 eq .",
    "( 8) reduces to the more familiar expression @xmath60\\ ] ]    the radiative corrections were taken into account by re - weighting every monte - carlo event , using mc - truth information , according to the recent calculations in @xcite .",
    "the minimization is performed by means of the `` minuit '' program @xcite .",
    "the errors are calculated by `` minos '' procedure of `` minuit '' at the level @xmath61 , corresponding to 68%   coverage probability for 1 parameter .",
    "a fit of the @xmath17 data with @xmath62 gives @xmath63 .",
    "the total number of bins is 6991 and @xmath64 .",
    "the quality of the fit is illustrated in figures 3 and 4 where the projected variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 are presented .",
