    "this paper describes a statistical procedure to extract resolution estimates on a track by track basis .",
    "the method was developed for the amanda neutrino telescope at the south pole  @xcite , which uses a 3-dimensional grid of photosensors imbedded in highly transparent ice to provide spatial and time resolution of cherenkov photons , that e.g. arise from long muon tracks .",
    "the knowledge of track resolutions is of particular importance in the search for localized sources , such as distant galaxies .",
    "the resolution information can in addition be used to suppress mis - reconstructed tracks , that typically are less well defined .",
    "the method is not limited to muon reconstruction in neutrino telescopes and can be applied to any experiment in which tracks have been reconstructed with a likelihood approach .",
    "in all following paragraphs a _ pattern of hits _ in an event will be modelled by an infinitely long oriented straight line .",
    "it will be parameterized by an arbitrary point @xmath0 on the track and the zenith @xmath1 $ ] and azimuth @xmath2 $ ] angles in a given detector coordinate system .",
    "the procedure presented operates on likelihood functions , thus a likelihood based reconstruction must be available . for any given hypothesis @xmath3 and an observed pattern of hits @xmath4 , a likelihood @xmath5 must be calculable .",
    "the hypothesis @xmath6 with the highest value of @xmath7 is considered to be the best estimate for the true values .",
    "it is assumed that this extremum has already been found .",
    "the uncertainties , which are to be determined , are in essence the errors of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is mandatory to use the optimal coordinate system for each event and to consider the errors in the determination of @xmath0 as well .    in order to arrive at a confidence ellipse in the two dimensions of track direction , the set in parameter space",
    "is being searched for , where the value of the negative logarithmic likelihood function has changed by @xmath10 with respect to @xmath11 : @xmath12 after discussing the coordinate systems used , the dimension of the problem will be reduced to the two dimensions of direction by eliminating the three dimensions of the location of @xmath0 .",
    "this is done using a numerical minimization process .",
    "the remaining @xmath13-minimization is done analytically to obtain the uncertainty estimators .",
    "the shape of the negative log - likelihood function around its minimum is considered gaussian .",
    "the tests described in section  [ section : tests ] prove that this assumption is realistic .      .",
    "the direction towards the track s origin is described with standard spherical coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "the downward orientation of the @xmath15-axis follows the amanda standards  @xcite . in b ) a rotated coordinate system @xmath16 is presented , where the @xmath17-axis is defined by the track . to describe directions that are close to the track s direction",
    ", relative coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 are introduced .",
    "they are approximately the coordinates in the tangent plane , as shown in c ) . ]",
    "there are two sets of coordinate systems used in the method presented here .",
    "the first system uses all five coordinates @xmath20 , which are connected to the 3-dimensional cartesian detector coordinate system as illustrated in figure  [ fig : coordinates ] a ) . in the second system the problem is reduced to the 2-dimensional subset of angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the complication with @xmath8 and @xmath9 is that the first has boundaries and the second is periodic .",
    "moreover , at the boundaries of @xmath8 the variable @xmath9 becomes meaningless . in a mathematical sense ,",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are locally orthogonal . however ,",
    "if one looks at these coordinates in the area surrounding a point , they are distorted - in particular close to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "as the behaviour of the likelihood function around the well known best track estimate @xmath25 is to be investigated , the coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 should be as close to being orthogonal as possible _ at that particular direction _",
    "hence the 3-dimensional detector coordinate system is rotated such that the new x - axis , @xmath17 , is defined by the track .",
    "this results in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : coordinates ] b ) , where the distortion is minimal .    here and in the following section  [ section : spaceangle ] only _ relative _ coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 will be referred to .",
    "this can be thought of as local coordinates in the tangential plane to the unit sphere at @xmath26 with the origin at the point , where the plane touches the sphere for distances less than @xmath33 . ] . by choosing a proper rotation",
    ", it is assured that the @xmath22-direction is parallel to the @xmath8-coordinate , i.e. towards the negative @xmath34-axis .",
    "the rotation must be such that the track , the @xmath15-axis , and the @xmath35-axis are in the same plane .",
    "the local coordinates are displayed in figure  [ fig : coordinates ] c ) .",
    "the location of the point @xmath0 is of no concern for the discussion of where a track points to .",
    "nevertheless the correlations of the errors in direction with the errors in determining @xmath0 need to be considered .",
    "the reduction procedure of the dimension shall first be discussed assuming only one spatial dimension @xmath36 and one directional dimension @xmath22 .     and a spatial coordinate @xmath36 .",
    "the rectangle around the ellipse has the size @xmath37 by @xmath38 . finding for each @xmath22 the corresponding @xmath36 with extremal likelihood , one arrives at the line shown.,width=302 ]",
    "consider the two - dimensional confidence ellipse in @xmath39-space ( figure  [ fig : ellipsewinkel ] ) .",
    "it is tilted versus the @xmath22-axis , which indicates a correlation of @xmath22 and @xmath36 . for each @xmath22 one",
    "determines the value of @xmath36 for which the common likelihood function gets maximal . in the strictly gaussian case ,",
    "the result is a straight line .",
    "the likelihood function along this line is again a gaussian as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "the width of this gaussian is @xmath40 as can be seen by straight forward calculation . in this error estimator",
    "@xmath40 the correlation @xmath41 is included by construction .",
    "the extension to three spatial and two directional dimensions is straight forward : first one determines a set of points in @xmath42 .",
    "for each point , the best guess , i.e. the best likelihood @xmath43 , is found with respect to @xmath0 .    in the gaussian approximation",
    "these points @xmath44 form a paraboloid .",
    "its parameters are found by analytic minimization , which is discussed next .      in order to find the paraboloid that best fits the points @xmath44 ,",
    "an analytic @xmath13-minimization is performed .",
    "the paraboloid @xmath45 is parameterized in its polynomial representation : @xmath46 the constant parameter",
    "is represented by @xmath47 and the parameters in first order by @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the symmetric @xmath50-matrix @xmath51 contains the second order parameters .",
    "using the method of least squares one calculates @xmath52 and requires the minimization conditions @xmath53 this leads to a six - dimensional inhomogeneous system of linear , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath54 , which are to be determined . ]",
    "equations : @xmath55 one can choose the set of points @xmath56 in a suitable way to simplify equation  ( [ eq : solveme6 ] ) . if for each point @xmath56 also @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are added to the set corresponds to @xmath60 . ] , one arrives at @xmath61 this leads to three equations : @xmath62 and a three - dimensional system @xmath63 which can easily be solved .",
    "the error estimators sought are contained in the parameters of the paraboloid .",
    "the three degrees of freedom of @xmath47 and @xmath64 correspond to the position of the minimum of the curve .",
    "the three parameters in @xmath54 contain the curvature of the paraboloid , which are functions of the resolution , as the covariance matrix @xmath65 of the gaussian approximation is the inverse of @xmath54 . from @xmath66",
    "one obtains : @xmath67     and @xmath21 can be represented either by @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and the covariance @xmath70 or by the major and minor axes @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and the rotation angle @xmath73 of the ellipse between the major axis and the @xmath22-direction.,width=302 ]    the results can also be represented in a more intuitive way using the major and the minor axes @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the confidence ellipse , and its rotation angle @xmath73 with respect to the @xmath21-axis ( figure  [ fig : ellipsedefinitions ] ) . in order to find this alternative representation ,",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath65 needs to be diagonalized .",
    "that leads to @xmath74 choosing @xmath75 , the rotation angle @xmath73 is then given by the expression @xmath76 in the following discussion a third representation @xmath77 will be used , where @xmath78 is connected to the area of the ellipse and @xmath79 is its excentricity : @xmath80 the rotation angle @xmath73 is the same as in the previous parameterization .",
    "this procedure can lead to unphysical , negative values for the variance estimators .",
    "this happens whenever the basic track finding procedure has not arrived at a good minimum in likelihood space .",
    "the search for the minimum should then be repeated more carefully .",
    "note , that the resolution estimates are calculated for each pattern of hits",
    "still they are not the _ true _",
    "values for the discrepancies of true and reconstructed direction , but estimates of the _ average _ discrepancy for a set of events , which are similar to the one under consideration .",
    "for a neutrino telescope it is common to quote the median @xmath81 of the spatial angle @xmath82 between true and reconstructed track direction in order to describe its resolution .",
    "this section is devoted to the connection of the error ellipse parameters to the space angle uncertainty @xmath83 .",
    "it is convenient to choose the representation of the ellipse using @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with @xmath73 not playing a role in this special context .",
    "the true direction lies within the area given by the error ellipse with a probability of @xmath84 .",
    "the median of a distribution corresponds to a @xmath85-probability .",
    "hence as a first step the ellipses need to be enlarged correspondingly .    in order to obtain @xmath83",
    ", one considers the gaussian likelihood function in its diagonal form , where the coordinates and @xmath86 are connected to @xmath21 and @xmath22 by a rotation of the angle @xmath73 . ]",
    "are @xmath87 and @xmath86 : @xmath88 to obtain the median @xmath89 , the function @xmath90 must be integrated from the center @xmath91 outwards until a cumulated probability of @xmath92 is reached .",
    "this integral is done in polar coordinates ( radius @xmath93 and angle @xmath94 ) @xmath95 for the special case of @xmath96 ( i.e. @xmath97 ) , the calculation can be carried out analytically and yields @xmath98 .     and",
    "varying @xmath79 , the _ equivalent radius _ @xmath89 is displayed , such that the true direction lies within a circle of radius @xmath89 with a probability of @xmath85.,width=302 ]    for the general case ( with arbitrary @xmath79 ) the integration must be carried out numerically . this has been done for the case of @xmath99 and the result is shown in figure  [ fig : excen_corr ] .",
    "the median @xmath89 scales linearly with @xmath78 .",
    "the curve is symmetric with respect to the exchange of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . to improve the speed of the program",
    "an approximation proportional to @xmath100 has been applied which results in the _ excentricity corrected spatial angle resolution estimation _ : @xmath101 the fit is also shown in figure  [ fig : excen_corr ] .",
    "the deviation in the interval @xmath102 $ ] is below @xmath103 . for applications where this is too coarse an approximation ,",
    "the exact results of the numerical integration can be stored in appropriate tables .",
    "the above algorithms have been tested within the framework of the amanda neutrino telescope .",
    "the estimates perform in a stable and reliable way and produce sensible results .      1 .   for @xmath40 and @xmath104 its _ pull _ has been studied .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the difference of true and reconstructed direction over the resolution estimator .",
    "if the estimation is good , the pull should be gaussian distributed , centered at zero and with unit width .",
    "this investigation can only be done in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "2 .   for the spatial angle resolution",
    "the pull is not a sensible quantity , because angles in space can only be positive .",
    "hence one can study ensembles of events with the same @xmath78 or @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "the median of the true deviation can then be compared to the corresponding @xmath78 . again",
    "this can only be done in the simulation .",
    "3 .   in data the true directions are not known .",
    "thus another approach is being followed .",
    "each event is split into two subevents by assigning every second hit to subevent 1 and the remaining hits to subevent 2 . each subevent undergoes reconstruction and is subjected to the resolution estimation algorithm .",
    "that leads to directions @xmath106 , @xmath107 and errors @xmath108 und @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "+ the pull @xmath111 should also be a gaussian distribution centered at zero with unit width . for @xmath112",
    "the difference in azimuth angles must be multiplied by @xmath113 to make up for the differences in the rotated and not rotated coordinate systems : @xmath114 of course this last check can also be done in the simulation .        1",
    ".   often one applies quality cuts to the data set , which rely on additional information that is not reflected in the construction of the likelihood function itself .",
    "hence this information is also not used in obtaining the resolution parameters . in this case one",
    "expects the selected tracks to be on average closer to the true direction than from the likelihood analysis alone .",
    "consequently one observes a pull with a width smaller than 1 . 2 .",
    "the resolution parameters - such as @xmath78 - can efficiently be used as cut variables , as misreconstructed events on average have a worse resolution than correctly reconstructed ones .",
    "3 .   the resolution estimation on an event - per - event basis can be used as additional input in point source searches .",
    "the information is hard to be included in the commonly used binned search algorithms @xcite .",
    "an appropriate procedure based on maximum likelihood methods that can integrate the new information in a natural way will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "i wish to thank the amanda collaboration for their support in obtaining the method described herein .",
    "i thank lutz kpke and alexander holfter for many an illuminative and productive discussion .",
    "i would also like to thank the german research foundation ( dfg ) and the german ministry of research and education ( bmbf ) for financial support of the amanda project ."
