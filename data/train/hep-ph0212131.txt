    "parton production in hard processes is normally followed by final - state radiation and subsequent hadronization , giving rise to collimated jets of hadrons as observed in experiments .",
    "the hadron distributions inside a jet known as jet fragmentation functions can be defined as the vacuum expectation values of the parton fields and the hadronic interpolating fields @xcite .",

    "one not only has to consider parton emission but also parton absorption @xcite in describing the evolution of the fragmentation functions .",
    "such a medium effect is closely related to the radiative parton energy loss , which also leads to modified fragmentation functions @xcite . in most of the studies of parton energy loss ,",

    "one can replace the mean free path by a transport parameter @xcite and eliminate the infrared problem by using a hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) resummed gluon propagator @xcite .",
    "however , it is still theoretically interesting to study the problem within the framework of field theory at finite temperature .",
    "this paper is our first attempt to study medium - modified fragmentation functions within qcd field theory at finite temperature .",
    "we will first extend the definition of the fragmentation functions to include the scenario of parton propagation inside a thermal bath .",
    "we will calculate the first order corrections to the parton fragmentation functions in a thermal medium in the leading logarithmic approximation and derive the corresponding modified evolution equations .",
    "we will find that the modified evolution equation can be cast into a similar form as the dglap equations in the vacuum .",

    "our distinct parton degrees of freedom lose energy to the medium mainly through the direct bremsstrahlung process . in order to obtain an explicit expression for this contribution to the energy loss",

    "for illustrative purposes , we choose the hard cut - off @xmath217 , where @xmath218 governs the thermalization of partons introduced to our thermal medium .",

    "( [ linear ] ) is quite striking since it dominates all other corrections as @xmath221 .",
    "this term is generated by the divergent behavior of the soft gluon emission rate . since @xmath222 as @xmath223 , the fractional energy carried by soft gluons saturates .",
    "this causes the amount of energy absorbed by the bath to be proportional to the size of the energy window that thermalizes with the bath , which is dictated by the temperature @xmath54 .",
    "such a linear term will appear in the asymptotic expansion ( as @xmath224 ) for any choice of assimilation function satisfying the requirements as we have given before .",
    "putting all of this together and performing similar calculations in the gluon sector , we rewrite eq.([ansatz ] ) as    [ nansatz ] @xmath225    as before , the linear term in the gluon sector is generated by the divergence of the soft gluon bremsstrahlung rate .",
    "these expressions indicate that the parton energy which contributes to a hadronic jet is reduced by an amount approximately proportional to the temperature of the thermal medium as the transverse momentum cut - off of the jet is increased .",
    "the effect is slightly smaller at lower energies due to absorption processes .",
    "this phenomenon arises from the fact that increasing the momentum cut - off increases the amount of transverse phase space available to partonic sub - processes , which increases the amount of energy lost to the bath .",
    "although our result was derived from a constant input distribution and rather simplistic assimilation functions , the qualitative effect of evolution is expected to be similar to that of a more realistic calculation . in particular , the dominant behavior of the thermalization mechanism over the phenomena of induced emission , absorption , annihilation and pauli blocking",
    "is expected to persist in a complete calculation .",
    "fluctuations in the thermal medium can also screen the quark flavor of a jet .",

    "at finite temperature , the leading quark in a jet can scatter into the thermal bath or annihilate with an anti - quark in the bath .",
    "as before , these processes generate a dependence of the quark number on both scale and parton energy . eq.([tev1 ] ) leads to the evolution equation @xmath230 for @xmath228 .",
    "as before , we illustrate the effect of this evolution equation at high energy by considering @xmath231 at the scale @xmath205 .",
    "this gives @xmath232 using the same assimilation function as above , we arrive at the expression @xmath233 which indicates a net transfer of flavor from the jet to the bach as the momentum scale is increased .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the effect of the medium on energy loss becomes larger with the energy of the leading parton , its effect on flavor loss diminishes as the energy is increased .",
    "this is essentially because the _ fractional _ rather than absolute energy loss is comparable to the net flavor loss .",
    "we can also consider the energy loss of a quark propagating through a thermal medium from a slightly different point of view .",
    "our interpretation of eq.([tevolution ] ) indicates that @xmath234 represents the probability that a leading quark of energy @xmath66 will split into a quark with energy between @xmath68 and @xmath235 and transverse momentum between @xmath236 and @xmath237 and a gluon .",
    "the effective energy loss of the leading quark can be summarized as the expectation value of the emitted gluon s energy .    to obtain a number for this quantity ,",

    "its sign indicates that it represents energy _",
    "gain _ to the quark when the energy is large .",

    "the result is that the energy _ per quark _",
    "the third term corresponds to energy that comes from the medium directly either from absorption / emission processes or via soft quark thermalization .",
    "this contribution indicates that the absorptive processes in the plasma overcome the emissive processes in the absence of thermalization ( @xmath244 ) , leading to a net energy gain .",
    "the details of the calculation depend on our choice of assimilation function , as well as transverse momentum cut - offs , but the results are nonetheless interesting .",

    "in this paper we have taken a first step in the study of parton fragmentation functions in a thermal qcd medium via thermal field theory .",
    "we extended the definition of the parton fragmentation functions to the case of a thermal medium with finite temperature which will reduce to the conventional fragmentation functions in the zero temperature limit .",
    "we then calculated the radiative corrections to these fragmentation functions within the framework of perturbative qcd at finite temperature and derived the corresponding dglap evolution equations .",
    "the modified evolution equations can be written in the same form as at zero temperature . however , the effective ( or medium modified ) splitting functions depend explicitly on the temperature and contain terms corresponding to various physical processes such as radiation , absorption , backward and forward scattering , etc .",
    "the introduction of the temperature causes the effective splitting functions to depend explicitly on the value of the initial parton energy .",
    "this complicates the renormalization group analysis of the effective fragmentation functions and causes us to modifiy their intepretation slightly .",
