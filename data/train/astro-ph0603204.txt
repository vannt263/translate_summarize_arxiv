    "when two black holes merge , the gravitational waves they produce will carry away net linear momentum , barring conditions of special symmetry ( e.g. , two equal - mass nonspinning black holes receive no kick ) .",
    "the magnitude of the resulting recoil is important in a variety of astrophysical contexts , including the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes @xcite and the growth and retention of intermediate - mass black holes in dense stellar clusters @xcite .",
    "there is therefore a long history of analytical estimates of this recoil @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that almost all of the recoil occurs in the strong gravity regime , inside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "this is precisely where analytical treatments are least reliable .",
    "an accurate estimate of the recoil kick therefore requires full numerical simulations of the final phase of the inspiral , merger , and ringdown of the coalescence of two black holes .    until recently ,",
    "numerical simulations were not stable and accurate enough for such estimates .",
    "this situation has changed dramatically in the past year , with several groups developing codes that have allowed the evolution of binary black hole spacetimes from close to the isco through merger and ringdown .",
    "most of these codes utilize techniques which allow the black holes , with their inherent singularities , to move successfully through the computational domain .",
    "one approach @xcite is to excise the singular region in the ( physically inaccessible ) interior of the black hole .",
    "in contrast , our method allows the singular region to be approximately represented in the computational domain @xcite .",
    "these new techniques have led to dramatically more effective numerical simulations of binary black hole systems , recently allowing us to determinate accurate waveforms for the final orbits and merger of equal mass systems @xcite , which we generalize here for nonequal masses .",
    "while some preliminary numerical calculations of recoil from mergers of non - spinning black holes have been reported @xcite , the initial separations have been too small and the resolutions too coarse for reliable and precise numbers .",
    "here we report the first precise fully numerical estimates of the kick received from the merger of two nonspinning black holes .",
    "we choose a 1.5:1 mass ratio because it is close to the analytically estimated optimal mass ratio for maximum kick @xcite , but is also close enough to equal mass that resolution issues are not serious impediments to the numerical evolution . in ",
    "2 we describe our numerical method and results , including convergence tests .",
    "we discuss the astrophysical implications of these results in   3 .",
    "reliable simulations of binary black hole mergers require the specification of constraint - satisfying initial field data followed by stable evolution of the einstein equations .",
    "the evolution variables hold information about gravitational fields in the form of tensor fields representing the curvature of a vacuum spacetime .",
    "einstein s equations , together with a crucial specification of gauge ( i.e. , coordinate ) conditions , then govern the evolution of these fields in time .",
    "we utilize the `` puncture '' approach @xcite to specify constraint - satisfying initial field configurations for black holes on an approximately circular inspiral trajectory within a few orbits of merger .",
    "specifically , we consider three initial separations of coordinate distances @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total initial gravitational mass of the system , and we use units where newton s gravitational constant @xmath7 and the speed of light @xmath8 are set to unity so that all quantities can be represented in terms of their mass - scaling .",
    "further , we try several slight variations in the initial angular momentum for the largest separation .",
    "these data begin our simulations as the system approaches the isco , allowing about 1 - 3 orbits before the formation of a common horizon representing the final black hole .",
    "this data is evolved by our finite - differencing code , hahndol @xcite , on an adaptive mesh refinement structure implemented via paramesh @xcite .",
    "the punctures are allowed to move freely through the grid and are evolved according to a variant of the bssn formulation of einstein s equations and gauge conditions as described in @xcite .",
    "we interpret our numerical results by studying the gravitational radiation generated by the merger which carries gauge - invariant information away from the strong - field region . in our simulations ,",
    "radiation is represented by a component of the space - time weyl curvature tensor , @xmath9 . in terms of @xmath9",
    ", the time rate of change of radiated momentum can be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath10 we compute @xmath9 numerically , and extract it from the simulation data on a sphere of radius @xmath11 , which we have found is sufficiently large enough to give precise results .",
    "our main numerical results are given in figure  [ fig : kickplot ] , which shows the net speed of the center of mass as a function of time for several runs .",
    "to compare runs at different initial coordinate separations we have shifted the time axis so that the kick speed peaks at @xmath12 .",
    "note that these curves are representative of a much larger body of simulation data .",
    "we have varied , for example , the finest grid spacing from @xmath13 to @xmath14 for the @xmath3 runs , and from @xmath13 to @xmath15 for the @xmath5 runs , and in either set of runs found the kick results of different resolutions agree to within @xmath16 , thus confirming our numerical precision .",
    "( and we have found that numerical error in these runs converges away at an acceptable rate ; see @xcite for previous convergence tests of our code . )",
    "we have also varied the extraction radius from @xmath17 to @xmath18 and , disallowing cases where the extraction radius significantly intersects refinement boundaries , we have found agreement across extraction radii to better than @xmath16 . we have also varied the initial , orbital angular momentum in the @xmath5 runs by as much as @xmath19 , resulting in a @xmath20 variation in the final kick values .",
    "our full range of final kick values is 86 - 116  km  s@xmath0 . excluding only the @xmath3 case on the grounds that it starts with too little initial separation ,",
    "our astrophysically relevant range of kick values is 86 - 97  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the selection of our initial momenta and centers of mass was informed by previous work on quasicircular initial data based on minimization of an effective potential @xcite , and further refined by trial and error .",
    "the most astrophysically relevant simulations were presumed to be those with the smoothest , monotonic radiation frequencies and time derivatives thereof . by these criteria",
    "our most reliable run gave a final kick of 92  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : kickplot ] is a post - newtonian result for the kick , as integrated from a low - frequency cutoff . because our simulation starts from a finite orbit , the resulting radiation has an effective low - frequency cutoff , which we have used in the post - newtonian calculation for consistency .",
    "we integrate , specifically , a 2pn formula for the orbital frequency @xcite and use the resulting frequency as a function of time in a 2pn formula for the radiated momentum @xcite . for most of the first orbit ,",
    "the agreement of the @xmath5 simulation represented in figure  [ fig : kickplot ] with the post - newtonian calculation is better than @xmath21 .",
    "recently , two groups have made refined analytic estimates of the kick from the merger of nonspinning black holes , both with precise answers but differing in magnitude by a factor of three .",
    "@xcite predict a speed of 155@xmath2225  km  s@xmath0 for a 1.5:1 mass ratio , whereas @xcite predict 48  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "our result is between these estimates but inconsistent with either one .",
    "we note , however , that blanchet , qusailah , & will ( 2005 ) integrate only until the horizons overlap , which is close to the peak of our kick . at that point , our most reliable run ( i.e. , with the widest initial separation and least apparent eccentricity ) gives a kick of @xmath23  km  s@xmath0 , which is encouragingly close to the analytic estimate .",
    "this points out the importance of the @xmath24% post - peak reduction in the kick .",
    "this reduction can also be seen in figure  5 of damour & gopakumar ( 2006 ) .",
    "we attribute it to the evolution by more than @xmath25 radians of the phase of the emitted momentum during the merger , which thus partially opposes the vector kick that exists at the time of horizon overlap .",
    "it is also noteworthy that , integrating only up to isco , blanchet , qusailah , & will ( 2005 ) obtain a kick of @xmath26  km  s@xmath0 for a mass ratio of 1.5:1 , and in our most reliable run we also obtain a kick of @xmath26  km  s@xmath0 at isco .",
    "an initial numerical estimate for 1.04:1 and 1.18:1 mass ratios was made by @xcite ( albeit at much lower resolution and starting much closer than our simulations ) , and they find kick speeds of 9  km  s@xmath0 and 33  km  s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "one can compare results at different mass with reference to the @xcite fitting formula @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mass ratio , @xmath29 is the symmetric mass ratio and @xmath30 is the fractional mass difference .",
    "although originally derived in the context of a leading order post - newtonian approximation , this formula is suggested to be a good approximation by perturbative schwarzschild calculations @xcite , and it also closely agrees with more recent post - newtonian results @xcite . by fitchett s formula , the @xcite results would imply @xmath31  km  s@xmath0 for a mass ratio of 1.5:1 , closer to our final value than the analytic estimates .",
    "our range of @xmath32  km  s@xmath0 ( and best estimate of @xmath33  km  s@xmath0 ) for the kick received in a 1.5:1 merger of nonspinning black holes has important implications for the assembly of supermassive black holes in the early universe ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is because as dark matter halos merge in the process of hierarchical structure assembly , their central black holes are also presumed to merge if the halo mass ratio is not too extreme ( otherwise dynamical friction on the halos is likely to be inefficient ; see @xcite ) .",
    "if black hole masses are linked to the mass of their host halos , it is therefore expected that in the early universe , black hole mergers are likely to involve comparable - mass objects . if the resulting kick exceeds the escape speed of the merged dark matter halo , the halo is left without a black hole .",
    "this could , therefore , have a significant impact on the number of black hole mergers in the early universe .",
    "in addition , if mergers between comparable - mass halos are common at redshifts @xmath1 , these ejections might reduce substantially the fraction of halos that host black holes",
    ".    a full appraisal of the consequences of recoil will require detailed numerical studies of the effects of black hole spin and mass ratio , which will be our subject in future papers .",
    "we can make initial guesses by focusing on nonspinning black holes and by adopting as before the @xcite formula for the dependence of kick speed on mass ratio .",
    "setting @xmath34  km  s@xmath0 fixes the curve .    to estimate the escape speed from a dark matter halo , we follow the treatment of @xcite .",
    "the escape speed from a halo of virial mass @xmath35 is @xmath36 , where as before we set @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the concentration parameter for the halo , @xmath38^{-1}$ ] , and we define @xmath39 as the radius inside which the average density is @xmath40 for a flat universe , where @xmath41 ( see @xcite , equation 6 ) . the critical density for a flat universe is @xmath42 \\approx 10^{-29}$ ]  g  @xmath43 ( e.g. , @xcite , section 3.2 ) .",
    "we use @xmath44 and @xmath45 . > from equation ( 18 ) of @xcite , the concentration parameter scales as @xmath46^{-0.13}(1+z)^{-1}$ ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : escape ] we plot the minimum halo mass as a function of redshift such that @xmath47 for the listed mass ratios of 1.5:1 , 3:1 , 5:1 , and 10:1 , as projected from our results by the fitchett scaling .",
    "note that the low power of @xmath35 in the escape speed means that the minimum halo mass depends sensitively on the kick speed .",
    "for example , if the kick speed at a 1.5:1 mass ratio were 200  km  s@xmath0 instead of 92  km  s@xmath0 , the threshold halo mass at @xmath48 for this mass ratio would jump from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "this would in turn reduce the number density of halos massive enough to retain their black holes by a factor @xmath51 ( see @xcite for a pedagogical discussion of how to estimate halo number densities ) .",
    "this points out the importance of estimating kick speeds accurately .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , kicks are also important in the current - day universe for low - mass concentrations of stars .",
    "their figure  2 is a useful summary of escape speeds from the centers of galaxies and globular clusters . from their figure",
    ", we see that comparable - mass mergers with kick speeds @xmath52  km  s@xmath0 will cause ejection from globulars and some dwarf galaxies , but that more massive galaxies will retain the remnant . using the @xcite scaling with mass ratio , we find that black holes that are @xmath53 times more massive than their companions are not ejected from globular clusters with escape speeds of a few tens of km  s@xmath0 .",
    "coincidentally , this is approximately the same mass ratio required to protect a massive black hole from cluster ejection from three - body interactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , if an intermediate - mass black hole of @xmath54 is formed in a cluster , it can stay and potentially grow through future interactions .",
    "stellar - mass binary black holes ( @xmath55 ) will be ejected from such clusters prior to merger by newtonian three - body interactions @xcite , hence recoil is not so important for low - mass black holes in this context .",
    "however , mergers of black hole binaries in low - density galactic disks could produce a population of high - speed coalesced black holes .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a reliable and precise , fully numerical estimate of the gravitational recoil produced by the merger of two unequal mass nonspinning black holes .",
    "our best estimate of 92@xmath226  km  s@xmath0 for a 1.5:1 mass ratio is intermediate between the recent analytic estimates of @xcite , who suggest 155@xmath2225  km  s@xmath0 for this mass ratio , and @xcite , whose formulae would imply 48  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "our results are thus an important step in accurately evaluating the astrophysical consequences of gravitational radiation recoil in dense stellar clusters and the early universe .",
