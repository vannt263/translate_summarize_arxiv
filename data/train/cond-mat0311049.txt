    "physics of two ionic solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane is of wide interest in cell biology and colloids science @xcite .",
    "a thermodynamical study of this problem was first carried out by f. g. donnan @xcite , considering the two fluids phases ( here referred as @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) in the following way : ( i ) the @xmath0-phase contains two ( small ) ionic species , ( ii ) the @xmath1-phase contains the same ionic species as the @xmath0-phase plus one macroion species .",
    "the two fluid phases are separated by a membrane which is permeable to the small ions and impermeable to macroions , therefore , they interchange small ions whereas macroions are restricted to the @xmath1-phase . the permeability condition is imposed by assuming ( in both phases ) a constant chemical potential of the permeating species . in this simple model ,",
    "donnan derived an expression for the osmotic pressure ( in terms of the ionic charge , concentration and excluded volume ) which well describes systems close to ideality .",
    "historically , this problem has been known as donnan equilibrium .",
    "more recently some theories have been proposed to interpret osmotic pressure data @xcite .",
    "these theories consider phenomenologically the macroion - macroion and ion - macroion many - body interactions , and provide a better fit for the osmotic pressure of macroions solutions than donnan theory .",
    "the surface of a biological membrane has a net charge when it is in aqueous solution @xcite thus , at a fluid - membrane interface a broad variety of phenomena occur .",
    "it is known that ionic solutions in the neighborhood of a charged surface produce an exponentially decaying charge distribution , known as the electrical double layer .",
    "low - concentrated solutions of monovalent ions are well described by the gouy - chapman theory ( poisson - boltzmann equation ) @xcite .",
    "however , multivalent ions display important deviations from this picture @xcite and more powerful theories from modern statistical mechanics ( such as molecular simulation @xcite , density functionals @xcite and integral equations @xcite ) have been implemented for studying ions adsorption and interfacial phenomena .",
    "macroions adsorption is a subject of current interest : in molecular engineering , the macroions adsorption mechanisms are basic in self - assembling polyelectrolyte layers on a charged substrate @xcite and novel colloids stabilization mechanisms @xcite .    by means of integral equations ,",
    "a previous study of donnan equilibrium has been carried out by zhou and stell @xcite .",
    "they used the method proposed by henderson _",
    "@xcite , which can be described as follows : starting from a semipermeable spherical cavity @xcite , the planar membrane is obtained taking the limit of infinite cavity radius . within this model",
    ", they obtained the charge distribution and mean electrostatic potential .",
    "however , due to the approximations used , they end up just with the integral version of the linear poisson - boltzmann equation",
    ". a general shortcoming of the poisson - boltzmann equation is that ionic size effects ( short range correlations ) are completely neglected , in consequence , the description of interfacial phenomena and computation of thermodynamical properties is limited and valid only for low values of charge and concentration .    from previous studies of two fluid phases separated by a _",
    "permeable _ membrane , it is known that the adsorption phenomena are strongly influenced by the membrane thickness @xcite . on the other hand , short range correlations influence effective colloid - colloid interaction @xcite , thermodynamical properties @xcite and adsorption phenomena @xcite in colloidal dispersions . from these antecedents",
    "it is seen that there are several relevant aspects not considered in previous studies of donnan equilibrium which deserve a proper consideration . in this study",
    "we consider explicitly the following effects : many - body ( short and long range ) correlations , the membrane thickness and the surface charge densities on each of the membrane faces .",
    "we use _ simple _ model interactions and our study is carried out by means of integral equations .",
    "the theory gives the particles distribution in the neighborhood of the membrane , from which , the osmotic pressure is calculated .",
    "there are two points that we will address in this study : the adsorption of macroions at the membrane surface and the computation of the osmotic pressure for macroions solutions . concerning the adsorption phenomena , we observe a broad variety of phenomena : charge reversal , charge inversion and macroions adsorption on a like - charged surface due to the fluid - fluid correlation .",
    "the computed osmotic pressure is compared with experimental results for a protein solution , obtaining an excellent agreement over a wide regime of concentrations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ theory ] we describe the integral equations method and the membrane and fluid models . in the same section ,",
    "we derive the _ hypernetted chain / mean spherical _ ( hnc / ms ) integral equations for the semipermeable membrane and the equations to compute the osmotic pressure . in section [ results ] a variety of results are discussed and finally in section [ conclusions ] some conclusions are presented .",
    "the method that we use to derive integral equations for inhomogeneous fluids makes use of a simple fact : in a fluid , an external field can be considered as a particle in the fluid , i. e. , as one more species infinitely dilute .",
    "this statement is valid in general , however , it is particularly useful in the statistical mechanics theory for inhomogeneous fluids @xcite described below .",
