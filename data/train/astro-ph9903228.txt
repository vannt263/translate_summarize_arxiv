    "the hard x - ray transient v0332 + 53 ( x0331 + 53 ) was first detected by the _",
    "vela 5b _ satellite during a bright outburst in 1973 ( terrel & priedhorsky 1984 ) .",
    "it was rediscovered ten years later by _ tenma _ during a series of smaller outbursts ( tanaka et al .",
    "_ exosat _ observations were used to determine that the source pulsates with a period of 4.4 s ( stella et al . 1985 ) .",
    "doppler shifts in pulse arriving times indicate that the pulsar is in a 34.25-d binary orbit with an eccentricity @xmath3 ( stella et al .",
    "the optical counterpart was identified by honeycutt & schlegel ( 1985 ) as the heavily - reddened early - type star bq cam .",
    "this object was observed to display highly variable h@xmath1 emission ( corbet , charles & van der klis 1986 , and references therein ) and infrared excess ( coe et al .",
    "these characteristics are typical of a be / x - ray binary .    in this subclass of massive x - ray binaries ,",
    "the x - ray emission is believed to be due to accretion of matter from a be star by a compact companion ( see white , nagase & parmar 1995 ; negueruela 1998 ) . the name `` be star '' is used as a general term describing an early - type non - supergiant star , which at some time has shown emission in the balmer series lines ( slettebak 1988 , for a review ) .",
    "both the emission lines and the characteristic strong infrared excess when compared to normal stars of the same spectral types are attributed to the presence of a circumstellar disc .",
    "most be / x - ray binaries have relatively eccentric orbits and the neutron star companion is normally far away from the disc surrounding the be star . due to their different geometries and the varying physical conditions in the circumstellar disc ,",
    "be / x - ray binaries can present very different states of x - ray activity ( stella , white & rosner 1986 ) . in quiescence , they display persistent low - luminosity ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) x - ray emission or no detectable emission at all .",
    "occasionally , they show series of periodical ( type i ) x - ray outbursts ( @xmath6 erg s@xmath5 ) , at the time of periastron passage of the neutron star ( e.g. , a0535 + 26 , motch et al .",
    "more rarely , they undergo giant ( type ii ) x - ray outbursts ( @xmath7 erg s@xmath5 ) , which do not show clear orbital modulation .",
    "some systems only display persistent emission , but most of them show outbursts and are termed be / x - ray transients .    like most other be / x - ray transients , v0332 +",
    "53 has shown both types of outbursts .",
    "the 1973 outburst lasted @xmath8 days and peaked at @xmath9 crab near july 10 .",
    "it was clearly a type ii outburst , even though whitlock ( 1989 ) found an underlying orbital modulation when the main trend was removed .",
    "on the other hand , the three weak outbursts separated by the orbital period observed in 1983 are type i outbursts . during these outbursts ,",
    "the pulsed fraction was small ( @xmath10% ) and the temporal behaviour was dominated by random rapid fluctuations ( makishima et al .",
    "the spectrum was fitted with a power - law modified by cyclotron absorption .",
    "unger et al . ( 1992 ) found that the pulse profile varied between a double - peaked and a single - peaked structure .",
    "the equivalent hydrogen column density remained relatively constant at @xmath11 atom @xmath12 .",
    "a prominent absorption feature at 28.5 kev , if attributed to electron cyclotron resonance , implies a magnetic field at the surface of the neutron star of @xmath13 g ( makishima et al .",
    "1990b ) .",
    "a new outburst was discovered by @xmath14 in september - october 1989 .",
    "the source remained very bright for more than two weeks , indicating that this was a type ii outburst .",
    "a quasi - periodic oscillation , possibly implying the presence of an accretion disc , was detected ( takeshima et al . 1994 ) .",
    "v0332 + 53 has not been detected by the batse experiment since the _ cgro _ satellite started operations in april 1991 ( bildsten et al .",
    "it is not detected with any significance by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on board _ rxte _ either , according to the quick - look results provided by the _",
    "rxte_/asm team .",
    "stella et al . (",
    "1986 ) interpret the lack of quiescence emission as an effect of centrifugal inhibition of accretion .",
    "we present data obtained as a part of the southampton / valencia / saao long - term monitoring campaign of be / x - ray binaries ( see reig et al .",
    "1997a ) , consisting of optical spectroscopy , infrared and optical broad - band photometry of bq cam , the optical counterpart to v0332 + 53 .",
    "the source was observed on august 14 , 1997 using the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , la palma , spain . the blue arm was equipped with the loral1 ccd and the r1200r grating , which gives a nominal dispersion of @xmath15  / pixel .",
    "a second observation was taken on november 14 , 1997 . on this occasion",
    "the blue arm was equipped with the r1200b grating and the eev#10 ccd , giving a nominal dispersion of @xmath16  / pixel over @xmath17  . a composite spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : blue ] .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the august spectrum is relatively low .",
    "the loral camera introduces several artifacts in the range @xmath18 41504250  , where the spectrum could well be dominated by noise .",
    "a very strong spurious feature was present at the wavelength where heii @xmath18 4200    should be found . between @xmath18 4320   and",
    "@xmath18 4500  , where both spectra overlap , all the features look very similar and only the higher quality november spectrum is shown .",
    "we have monitored the source since 1990 , using the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope ( int ) and 4.2-m wht , both located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos , and the 1.5-m telescope at palomar mountain ( pal ) .",
    "a log of observations , together with some parameters measured , is presented in table [ tab : halpha ] .",
    "the palomar spectra have relatively low snr and the error in ew , arising due to the difficulty of determining the continuum , is @xmath19 .",
    "the line shapes are also difficult to establish . in contrast , the int and wht spectra have all relatively high resolution and errors in the ew of h@xmath1 are @xmath20",
    ". the double - peaked structure of h@xmath1 is only clearly visible in the spectra with dispersions of 0.4  / pixel or better .",
    "all the data have been reduced using the _ starlink _ software packages ccdpack ( draper 1998 ) and figaro ( shortridge et al .",
    "1997 ) and analysed using figaro and dipso ( howarth et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "h@xmath1 spectra normally show hei @xmath186678   as a very weak emission feature when the snr is sufficiently large for it to be separated from the noise .",
    "an analysis of h@xmath1 variability in bq cam during 19901991 has been presented in negueruela et al .",
    "many of the spectra whose parameters are listed in table [ tab : halpha ] are shown in their fig .",
    "8 , and are therefore not reproduced here .",
    "negueruela et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that during 19901991 , the h@xmath1 line presented v / r variability with a quasi - period of @xmath21 year , but this variability stopped late in 1991 .",
    ".details of the h@xmath1 spectroscopy .",
    "the fwhm of h@xmath1 has been calculated by fitting a single gaussian to the line profile and should therefore be taken only as an approximation . in the higher resolution",
    "spectra , however , this procedure gives values consistent with direct measurement to within 5% . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the infrared lightcurves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : irlc ] ) of bq cam show a general fading trend , only interrupted by a brief brightening in 19881989 .",
    "the brightest magnitudes observed are those from late 1983 , when the source was active in the x - rays , coinciding with the highest ews of h@xmath1 reported ( @xmath22 and @xmath23  ; kodaira et al .",
    "1985 ; stocke et al .",
    "the decline of the strength of h@xmath1 ( iye & kodaira 1985 ) was accompanied by the fading of infrared magnitudes .",
    "corbet et al . (",
    "1986 ) and coe et al .",
    "( 1987 ) interpret the decline as being due to the dispersion of the circumstellar disc of the be star .",
    "the infrared magnitudes remained stable during 19851987 , but brightened again in 1988 , reaching values similar to those of 1983 .",
    "after the type ii outburst in late 1989 , the infrared magnitudes faded to a deeper minimum , where they have remained until 1995 , though showing considerable short - time variability .",
    "there does not seem to be any corresponding systematic change in h@xmath1 ew ( see table [ tab : halpha ] ) .",
    "the variability in h@xmath1 during 19901991 can be associated with the v / r cycle seen at the time ( negueruela et al .",
    "1998 ) . given the similarity between the relatively high - resolution spectra of 28 august 1991 , 14 december 1991 , 14 august 1997 and 14 november 1997 , it seems unlikely that any significant v / r variability has been present after 1991 .",
    "it is noteworthy that , while the infrared colours have experimented large fluctuations ( @xmath24 mag in @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath27 ) , the associated colours have remained much more stable ( with @xmath28 ) . there is no clear correlation between the brightness and the colours . if , for instance , we compare the @xmath25 magnitude with @xmath29 , we see that the faintest observations can be either very blue ( tjd 48665 ) or relatively red ( tjd 48494 ) .",
    "the brightest observations are on average relatively red , but not more than some faint points .    using the correlations of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) , from the observed",
    "@xmath30 we deduce @xmath31 and @xmath32 , implying an interstellar reddening @xmath33 . using the fainter and bluer infrared observations ( tjd 48665 ) , we find @xmath34 and @xmath35 , implying @xmath36 , which is roughly compatible with wegner s ( 1994 ) average value of @xmath37 for o9v stars , if we consider the errors in his value and in the standard relations used .",
    "the measured @xmath38 is , within the errors , compatible with the value for interstellar reddening found above and implies that no circumstellar reddening was present .",
    "this corresponds to a state in which the disc is optically thin at all infrared wavelengths and very little infrared emission is produced ( see dougherty et al .",
    "brighter magnitudes with a similarly blue colour ( as in tjd 49701 ) must represent a state in which the disc is producing a significant amount of infrared emission , but still remains optically thin , giving rise to no circumstellar reddening  a condition which could be associated with a very small disc ( dougherty et al .",
    "very faint magnitudes with redder colours ( as in tjd 49664 ) represent states in which little emission is present , but the disc has become ( partially ) optically thick in @xmath27 , which can be associated with a larger disc or with a change in the density gradient .",
    "when the disc is very bright ( as in 1983 or 1988 ) , it is always relatively red .",
    "the circumstellar emission is very intense ( contributing @xmath21 mag ) , but the disc is optically thick in all wavelengths , and the circumstellar reddening remains constant at a low value , presumably because the disc is still small ( dougherty et al .",
    "we have shown that the optical counterpart to v0332 + 53 is an o89ve star , further skewing the spectral distribution of be / x - ray binary transients towards earlier spectral types ( see negueruela 1998 ) .",
    "our distance estimate is higher than those of previous authors , who observed brighter magnitudes due to larger disc contamination .",
    "honeycutt & schlegel ( 1985 ) report @xmath39 and @xmath40 in two separate observations taken on november 27 - 28 , 1983 , and february 21 , 1984 , while our observations show magnitudes fainter by @xmath41 mag , though the values for @xmath42 are compatible within the observational errors .",
    "normally observed photometric variability of classical be stars is typically @xmath43 .",
    "therefore bq cam does not show variations as large as v635 cas , the optical counterpart to 4u0115 + 634 ( negueruela et al .",
    "1997 ) , but it is more variable than most classical be stars . at a distance of @xmath0 kpc , the maximum x - ray luminosity of v0332 + 53 observed by @xmath44 5@xmath45 is @xmath46 erg s@xmath5 , close to the eddington luminosity for a neutron star . at this distance ,",
    "bq cam is not likely to be part of the perseus arm , but rather of an outer galactic arm ( see kimeswenger & weinberger 1989 ) .    with an inclination angle @xmath47 ,",
    "the orbital solution for v0332 + 53 implies @xmath48 m. for a companion mass @xmath49 , this implies a periastron distance @xmath50 m @xmath51 , where the radius of the optical star is assumed to be @xmath52 ( vacca et al . 1996 ) . using our value for @xmath53 and",
    "huang s ( 1972 ) law @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the separation between the peaks of an emission line and keplerian rotation of the envelope is assumed ( which gives upper limits ) , we obtain outer emission radii @xmath56 and @xmath57 for h@xmath1 , h@xmath58 and hei @xmath186678   in november 1997 .",
    "this clearly shows that the neutron star does not come close to the dense regions of the circumstellar disc in the present situation .",
    "the neutron star is only reached by the low - density outer envelope and accretion is centrifugally inhibited ( stella et al .",
    ". the reduced size of the circumstellar disc strongly points at the possibility of disc truncation by the neutron star , an idea advanced by okazaki ( 1998 ) and supported by the results of reig , fabregat & coe ( 1997b ) .",
    "this truncation would explain why we observe instances of a small disc which is optically thick at all wavelengths , implying a very high density .",
    "we note that v635 cas shows large brightness variations with little change in the associated colours ( negueruela et al .",
    "1997 ) , a behaviour that could be associated with a very optically thick disc ( dougherty et al .",
    "this variability extends to the @xmath45 band , which can change by at least @xmath59 .",
    "it seems likely then that the disc in bq cam is not so optically thick as that in v635 cas at optical wavelengths , but can be very optically thick in the infrared .",
    "roche et al . ( 1999 ) find that optical and infrared observations of the be / x - ray transient cep x-4 are also best explained with a truncated dense disc .",
    "we have established that the orbit of the neutron star is likely to be inclined with respect to the equatorial plane of the be star ( in which the disc is suppose to lie while it is dynamically stable ) .",
    "this is in contradiction with the general argument presented by waters et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , but it is in not unexpected .",
    "we note that the be + neutron star system psr b1259@xmath6063 , which is believed to be a representative of the class of systems which will evolve into be / x - ray binaries , is likely to have a tilted orbit with respect to the equatorial plane of the be star ( see ball et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) , and the b + neutron star system psr j0045@xmath607319 , which must have formed in a way analogous to be / x - ray binaries , has been shown to have a rotation axis misaligned with the orbit ( kaspi et al .",
    "the relevance of this misalignment to the formation and evolution of binary systems containing neutron stars has been discussed by van den heuvel & van paradijs ( 1997 ) and iben & tutukov ( 1998 )    corbet & peele ( 1997 ) have suggested a possible 34.5-d period for the be / x - ray binary 3a0726@xmath60260 .",
    "if this period was to be confirmed , the comparison between v0332 + 53 and 3a0726@xmath60260 would be most interesting , since the two systems would have neutron stars orbiting oe stars of almost identical spectral types with extremely similar orbital periods .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray activity of these two systems is completely different .",
    "v0332 + 53 is a transient , which spends most time in quiescence and shows very bright outbursts , while 3a0726@xmath60260 seems to be a persistent low - luminosity source with small outbursts .",
    "the difference in pulse periods ( 4.4-s against 103.2-s ) could be reflecting the very different behaviour of accreted material in magnetic fields of very different intensity .",
    "however , we note that the quiescent luminosity of 3a0726@xmath60260 is almost identical to that of a0535 + 262 , which has almost the same spin period , but a much broader orbit .",
    "this , together with the fact that the source lies nowhere close to the @xmath61 relationship for be / x - ray binaries , casts some doubt on the orbital period until it can be confirmed using orbital doppler shift in the arrival time of pulses .",
    "we have presented long - term photometry and spectroscopy of the optical component of the be / x - ray binary v0332 + 53 , which indicate that it is an o89ve star at a distance of @xmath0 kpc .",
    "we find evidence for a tilt of the orbital plane with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "the lack of recent x - ray activity is explained by the fact that the dense regions of the circumstellar disc around the oe star do not reach the orbit of the neutron star .",
    "the low inclination of the orbit allows us to determine a periastron distance @xmath62 , while measurements from our high - resolution spectroscopy of emission lines set the outer radius of the h@xmath1 emitting region at @xmath63 . under these conditions , centrifugal inhibition of accretion",
    "effectively prevents any x - ray emission .",
    "we would like to thank the uk patt and the spanish cat panel for supporting our long - term monitoring campaign .",
