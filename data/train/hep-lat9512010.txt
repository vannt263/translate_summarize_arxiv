    "matrix elements of local operators can be determined by lattice techniques .",
    "the corresponding monte carlo simulation provides the continuum value of the matrix element modified by lattice finite renormalizations .",
    "the renormalization constants are usually evaluated perturbatively .",
    "they can also be evaluated by using non - perturbative methods .",
    "these methods yield the renormalization constants at any value of the bare coupling @xmath2 avoiding the uncertainties derived from the knowledge of only the few first terms in the perturbative series and from the asymptotic character of the series .",
    "a well - known example of calculation of renormalization constants happens during the determination of the topological susceptibility in qcd or in @xmath3 models .",
    "the monte carlo signal for this quantity is @xcite @xmath4 in this equation @xmath5 is the space - time dimension , @xmath6 is the lattice spacing ( related to the bare coupling through the beta function ) , @xmath7 is the non - perturbative part of the vacuum expectation value of the trace of the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are finite renormalizations",
    ". the topological susceptibility on the lattice is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a suitable definition of the topological charge operator on the lattice and @xmath13 is the space - time volume .",
    "the calculation of the constants @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be performed either by applying perturbation theory or by using the so - called heating method @xcite .",
    "this is a direct non - perturbative method to evaluate the renormalization constants as it does not rely on any expansion .",
    "it consists in heating a classical initial configuration having a known topological charge @xmath14 .",
    "the previous renormalization constants will show up during the first steps of thermalization because only short wave fluctuations are generated at this stage .",
    "this method has been used in the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model @xcite and in qcd @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to check the validity of this non - perturbative method by comparing it with perturbation theory at large @xmath15 values .",
    "we performed the check on the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model in two dimensions . in the continuum this model is defined by the action @xmath16 with the constraint @xmath17 for all @xmath18 . on the lattice",
    "we will make use of the symanzik tree - level improved action @xcite @xmath19 henceforth @xmath20 . the lattice definition we used for the topological charge density is @xmath21 \\left [ \\phi^k(x+\\nu ) - \\phi^k(x-\\nu ) \\right].\\ ] ] the first two perturbative coefficients of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the previous lattice action and charge density are known @xcite .",
    "we will test the heating method by measuring these two renormalization constants at very large @xmath15 .    at fixed lattice size @xmath24 and large @xmath15",
    "all spins tend to be parallel and small fluctuations around the trivial vacuum is the only physics present in the system .",
    "the small value of the ratio @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the correlation length ) prevents disorder to appear .",
    "therefore long wavelength fluctuations can hardly be generated . in these conditions",
    "perturbation theory becomes exact @xcite . on the other hand , within our statistical errors ,",
    "the perturbative series can be well approximated by the first two coefficients if using @xmath27 .",
    "hence this approximate result from the perturbative series should reproduce the obtained value from the heating method .",
    "we chose the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model because it is known that the instanton size distribution in this model favours small instantons @xcite .",
    "therefore an instanton heated at @xmath28 can be well accommodated on a lattice size @xmath29 which is the biggest lattice we will use .    as a byproduct",
    "we show how to use the heating method to compute the first coefficients of the perturbative expansions in equation ( 1.1 ) with rather high precision .",
    "in section 2 we will review the heating method and the results and conclusions will be shown in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the heating method @xcite is a procedure to non - perturbatively determine the renormalization constants in equation ( 1.1 ) .",
    "we start from a given classical configuration @xmath30 having some known topological charge @xmath14 .",
    "then we construct ensembles of configurations @xmath31 obtained after performing @xmath32 thermalization steps on the initial @xmath30 configuration at some value of @xmath15 . for small @xmath32",
    "it is expected that the updating sweeps create only small fluctuations up to distances of a few lattice spacings . for this purpose",
    "it is important to use a slow updating algorithm .",
    "convenient algorithms are metropolis and heat - bath .",
    "we used a heat - bath algorithm .",
    "if the correlation length satisfies @xmath33 then we can assume that the configuration contains small statistical fluctuations on a background of topological charge @xmath14 .",
    "the main assumption of the method is that these fluctuations are responsible for the renormalizations  @xcite .",
    "therefore if @xmath34 and at each @xmath32 we measure @xmath12 then after few updating steps the measured value of @xmath35 divided by @xmath14 will give us @xmath36 .",
    "if we measure @xmath37 and @xmath38 then after few steps the monte carlo signal will reach the value of @xmath39 .    to create the initial configuration @xmath30 with topological charge @xmath38 we put all spins parallel to some axis .",
    "when the initial configuration must contain a charge @xmath34 then we put by hand a charge - one instanton field on the lattice . for this purpose",
    "we use the well - known expression in the continuum for such one - instanton field @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the coordinate on the two - dimensional euclidean space - time and @xmath42 is the center of the instanton ; we always put this center at the geometrical center of the lattice , @xmath43 . in this equation @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the orientation and size of the instanton respectively .",
    "we chose @xmath46 . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the value for @xmath45 .",
    "once the instanton has been put on the lattice , we apply a relaxation process on the configuration to settle it .",
    "indeed the initial charge is usually less than  1 and after the relaxation it approaches  1 .",
    "the relaxation process is repeated until the value of @xmath14 stabilizes .",
    "the relaxation algorithm used was the cooling @xcite .",
    "we performed 30 cooling steps .",
    "however , even after the cooling , the background topological charge @xmath14 was never exactly  1 .",
    "it was close but less than  1 .",
    "this fact is not surprising as there are no known exact instanton solutions on the lattice .",
    "moreover it is known that a single topological charge - one field is not allowed on a continuum torus @xcite and we use a periodic lattice to perform our numerical simulations .",
    "therefore it is not clear whether the heating method to compute @xmath22 will work or not . in particular",
    "when we normalize the measured @xmath35 with @xmath14 , @xmath47 , we could use either the lattice non - integer value of @xmath14 or the corresponding integer continuum value . using exact toroidal biinstanton solutions",
    "@xcite does not ameliorate the situation because on the lattice @xmath14 is again close but less than  2 . in this work",
    "we will try to clarify these points .",
    "the signal of our observables measured during a numerical simulation is less noisy at large values of the ratio @xmath48 . in this case",
    ", we can get rather accurate results with low statistics .",
    "in particular , working at large values of @xmath15 allows us to observe the lattice size dependence of the renormalization constants .",
    "we expect that the perturbative tail  @xmath23 have a clear dependence on @xmath24 while the multiplicative renormalization might be independent of @xmath24 as the perturbative procedure to obtain @xmath22 predicts .",
    "in this section we will describe the simulations performed to determine both the multiplicative renormalization @xmath22 and the perturbative tail @xmath23 in equation ( 1.1 ) .    at large values of @xmath15",
    "the signal from the mixing with the trace of the energy - momentum tensor ( see equation 1.1 ) is totally negligible .",
    "therefore we can not check the perturbative expansion of @xmath49 in equation ( 1.1 ) .",
    "we performed several measures of the multiplicative renormalization @xmath36 .",
    "we used two lattices : @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath28 . at these values of @xmath15",
    "the ratio @xmath48 is @xmath53 . in both cases we studied the dependence of the result on the instanton size @xmath45 .",
    "the simulations showed a strong dependence on this parameter . for large instanton sizes",
    "@xmath54 the data raise while for small sizes @xmath55 the curve falls off ( see figure  1 ) . in the first case",
    "finite lattice size effects distort the instanton distribution cutting it off at the boundary of the lattice .",
    "we understand that the monte carlo signal at these values of @xmath45 has no physical meaning . in the second case",
    "the instanton is too small and after few heating steps it gets dissolved in the statistical fluctuations around it . in consequence the topological content gets lost .    in between",
    "we see a window of instanton sizes for which the monte carlo signal of the heating method displays a long and clear plateau ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is the height of the plateau normalized to the initial charge @xmath14 .",
    "the drift downwards of the curve for small @xmath45 makes it difficult to determine the value of @xmath22 .",
    "this fact is reflected in the larger error bars for small @xmath45 . for large @xmath45 we chose the minimum of the curve as the value for @xmath22 . in figure 2 and 3",
    "we show the value of the plateau as a function of @xmath56 for the two lattices we used .    for values of @xmath15 in the scaling window of the model ( @xmath57 in usual simulations ) a slow drop of the curves is seen .",
    "this is due to the creation of small size instantons with opposite charge than the initial one @xcite .",
    "this is a systematic error which one has to face when applying the heating method to the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model @xcite . at large values of @xmath15 ,",
    "the strong critical slowing down prevents the creation of such instanton sea around the background .",
    "hence we think that the behaviour of the data at small @xmath45 is well explained by the loss of the background instanton in the middle of the fluctuations .    before extracting the value of @xmath36 from figure  2 and  3",
    "we will discuss the statistics used in each run .",
    "for the runs on a @xmath50 lattice at @xmath51 we performed 1000 trajectories of 100 heating steps .",
    "the data shown in figure  1 are the average of these 1000 trajectories .",
    "for the @xmath52 lattice at @xmath28 we performed 20 trajectories of 150 heating steps . in each case",
    "an autocorrelation analysis was done .",
    "the data are correlated at distances of @xmath58 heating steps .",
    "we calculated the height and error of the plateau taking into account this effect .",
    "the step where the plateau starts can be determined by just having a look at the curve ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "> from this first point ( say @xmath59 ) we averaged all heating steps until some @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "the height of the plateau was obtained by looking for a stable result of this average while varying @xmath60 from @xmath62 to  100 .",
    "the results of the calculation of @xmath36 for each @xmath45 are shown in tables i and ii corresponding to figures  2 and  3 respectively . getting the value of @xmath63 from figure  3",
    "the window of stable instanton sizes is apparent . as the lattice size diminishes , this window shrinks and becomes a flex point of the curve .",
    "to determine the flex point of the curve in figure  2 we first interpolated the monte carlo points with an odd degree polynomial and then we evaluated analytically the flex point . increasing the degree of the polynomial , the result for the flex stabilizes . in table",
    "iii we show the results of this calculation as a function of the degree of the interpolating polynomial .",
    "the values for @xmath36 obtained from these figures are @xmath64 and @xmath65 . on the other hand the one - loop and two - loop order coefficients of this multiplicative renormalization are @xmath66 the values for @xmath67 and @xmath68 were first calculated on finite size lattices by substituting the corresponding loop integrals for sums .",
    "then these results were extrapolated to infinite lattice size .",
    "the extrapolating function was @xmath69 .",
    "this extrapolation was stable within ten digits for @xmath70 without including logarithms of @xmath24 in the previous fuction .",
    "therefore the analytical prediction for the multiplicative renormalization is @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we see an excellent agreement between the theoretical and monte carlo values .",
    "the lattice size independence of @xmath22 is hard to reveal from our method . to see a clear flex point in figure  2 we must work on lattice sizes satisfying @xmath73 which means @xmath74 . at @xmath75",
    "the difference @xmath76 can not be seen at the values of @xmath15 we work .",
    "all the data shown for @xmath22 were equal to the monte carlo signal for @xmath35 divided by the initial charge on the lattice after 30 cooling steps , @xmath14 .",
    "we could also divide @xmath35 by the corresponding continuum initial charge , _",
    "i.e. _ : the integer closest to the lattice value of @xmath14 .",
    "the lattice values of @xmath14 are @xmath77 on the @xmath50 lattice at @xmath78 and @xmath79 on the @xmath52 lattice at @xmath80 .",
    "notice that these values can not depend on @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding continuum values would clearly be @xmath34 .",
    "had we used these continuum values for normalizing the monte carlo signal we would have got wrong results for @xmath22 . indeed for the @xmath50 lattice at @xmath51 we would have obtained 0.992176(2 ) while for the @xmath52 lattice at @xmath28 the result would have been 0.999127(1 ) .",
    "we conclude that the normalization has to be done by consistently using the lattice value of @xmath14 .",
    "we can also look at the problem the other way round and try to determine the value of @xmath67 from the monte carlo data .",
    "equating the monte carlo value for @xmath63 to @xmath81 we get @xmath82 .",
    "we can do the same for @xmath83 obtaining @xmath84 .",
    "these results are in agreement with equation ( 3.1 )",
    ".      the determination of the perturbative tail @xmath23 can be performed by heating a trivial configuration , _",
    "i.e. _ : all spins parallel to some previously chosen direction @xmath85 in the @xmath0 space .",
    "we started every trajectory with a different direction @xmath85 chosen at random .",
    "we used rather small lattices in order to check the lattice size dependence of @xmath23 : @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    the dashed line and circles in figure  4 display the perturbative prediction and the result of the simulation on a @xmath88 lattice at @xmath51 .",
    "we performed 60 heating steps and @xmath89 trajectories .",
    "the perturbative tail has the form @xmath90 at @xmath86 the values of the coefficients are @xmath91 and @xmath92 . to calculate the second coefficient",
    "we must include the zero mode contribution @xcite which amounts to @xmath93 of the whole term .",
    "hence @xmath94 . in figure  4",
    "we see an impressive agreement with the monte carlo value @xmath95 . in doing the fit to an horizontal line we eliminated the autocorrelations of the data .",
    "the solid line and triangles in figure  4 display the same perturbative prediction and simulation for a @xmath96 lattice .",
    "each trajectory consisted of 100 heating steps .",
    "for this lattice size the perturbative coefficients are @xmath97 and @xmath98 . here",
    "the zero mode term is negligible .",
    "therefore @xmath99 .",
    "the monte carlo result is @xmath100 .",
    "the agreement is again satisfactory .",
    "we can see a lattice size dependence in the perturbative tail which agrees with the one predicted by perturbation theory .",
    "again we can compute the first perturbative coefficients from the previous monte carlo data . from the data on a @xmath88 lattice and neglecting the contribution at four loops , we get @xmath101 .",
    "on @xmath96 we get @xmath102 .",
    "in this work we have checked the heating method to calculate the renormalization constants present in the determination of the topological susceptibility on the lattice .",
    "we simulated the @xmath0 non - linear @xmath1-model in two dimensions .",
    "we used the method at large correlation lengths in order to eliminate all non - perturbative effects and see only the perturbation - theory predictions on the monte carlo signal .",
    "the idea is based on the fact that at fixed lattice size @xmath24 and large correlation lengths @xmath103 perturbative calculations are expected to become exact .",
    "this conjecture has been rigorously proven in the @xmath104 model @xcite .",
    "the positive conclusion of the test we performed supports the conjecture also on the @xmath0 model .",
    "the choice of the @xmath0 @xmath1-model was motivated by the fact that this model can accommodate small instantons @xcite and at very large correlation length the size of the lattice in physical units strongly diminishes .",
    "we computed the multiplicative renormalization @xmath22 of the lattice topological charge , @xmath105 as well as the perturbative tail of the corresponding topological susceptibility  @xmath23 .",
    "hence we computed static quantities by using a monte carlo simulation thus proving that the renormalization effects are the average of the statistical fluctuations .    concerning the calculation of the multiplicative renormalization",
    "@xmath22 we know that one - instanton solutions do not exist on the lattice and they are absent even for continuum tori @xcite .",
    "however we have checked that the usual solutions on the continuum space - time @xcite can be used to calculate @xmath22 even though they present a non - integer topological charge and are not stable solutions of the lattice field equations .",
    "we think that this is a notable result .",
    "other conclusions which come out from our computation of @xmath22 are _",
    "( i ) _ the background charge @xmath14 remains stable during the whole heating trajectory , indeed we showed that the final result for @xmath22 is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath14 ; _ ( ii ) _ we see that although small fluctuations soon raise , small instantonic objects which could lower the value of @xmath22 are absent , thus the critical slowing down seems to apply also to small instantons .",
    "another clear conclusion of this work is that to compute @xmath22 we must always divide the monte carlo signal @xmath35 by the non - integer lattice topological charge @xmath14 of the initial configuration .",
    "a natural question raises at this point : does the @xmath45 dependence persist at values of @xmath15 in the scaling window ( @xmath106 ) ? at low values of @xmath15 there is more disorder in the configuration resulting in larger statistical fluctuations which bring about larger error bars in the lattice measure of any observable .",
    "on the other hand small topological objects can appear @xcite yielding a modification of the trajectories .",
    "therefore the answer of the previous question is possibly yes but the largest statistical and systematic errors overwhelms this effect .",
    "finally , concerning the calculation of the perturbative tail , we saw a good agreement between perturbation theory and monte carlo results .",
    "they also displayed a lattice size dependence according to the perturbation - theory predictions .",
    "the heating method works well and when correctly used it gives the right answers .",
    "one has to take care also to the point where the plateau sets in ( in our simulations it sets in after many heating steps , about 40 for the multiplicative renormalization ) and also to the strong autocorrelations which can mask the true plateau .",
