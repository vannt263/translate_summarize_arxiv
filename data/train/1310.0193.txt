    "our understanding of how the chiral anomaly affects the dynamics of relativistic plasmas has deepened considerably in recent years .",
    "first insights into macroscopic effects of quantum anomalies go back to the early 1980s , when vilenkin found that rotating thermal matter emits equilibrium ( anti)neutrino currents that - as a consequence of their handedness - are oriented preferentially along ( opposite to ) the angular velocity vector  @xcite or an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "related macroscopic parity - violating effects were discussed in the 1990s for systems as different as superfluid @xmath1he - a  @xcite , and the electro - weak plasma in the early universe  @xcite . as understood more recently ,",
    "it is a direct consequence of the second law of thermodynamics that the viscous relativistic hydrodynamics of any charged plasma with triangle anomaly carries currents with terms proportional to the vorticity and proportional to an external magnetic field  @xcite . rather than being set by new material properties ,",
    "the strength of these anomalous contributions is given in terms of known thermodynamic functions and it is generally finite for non - vanishing chemical potentials .",
    "anomalous hydrodynamics therefore must display currents with features that do not have a direct counterpart in plasmas without quantum anomalies .",
    "the charged plasmas of quantum field theories with gravity duals provide examples for which these features arise in explicit calculations  @xcite .",
    "there is also significant progress in understanding how anomalous hydrodynamics arises in the long wavelength limit of classical kinetic theory supplemented by the notion of berry curvature  @xcite , how it emerges in the quantum kinetic approach  @xcite , and which terms arise in anomalous hydrodynamics beyond the first order in viscous corrections  @xcite .    in the quark gluon plasma of the phenomenologically realized quantum field theory of qcd",
    "coupled to electrodynamics , the fermionic degrees of freedom carry both , the conserved electromagnetic and the anomalous axial charge .",
    "the collective close - to - equilibrium dynamics of the quark gluon plasma provides therefore a special case of anomalous hydrodynamics  @xcite : for non - vanishing chemical potential of the axial charge , @xmath2 , an external magnetic field @xmath3 or a vorticity @xmath4 in the fluid induces an electromagnetic vector current @xmath5 . and for non - vanishing vector chemical potential @xmath6 , vorticity or an external magnetic field induces an axial current @xmath7 .",
    "the question to what extent these characteristic features of the chiral anomaly could lead to experimentally accessible signatures in the plasma produced in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is currently at the focus of an intense theoretical debate  @xcite and of experimental searches @xcite .",
    "several proposed signatures of anomalous hydrodynamics are based on the idea that the large @xmath3-field in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions induces an axial charge asymmetry between the two hemispheres separated by the reaction plane .",
    "originally , experimental searches focussed mainly on a scenario  @xcite according to which these axial charges , due to interactions with non - trivial gauge configurations , transferred into an electric charge asymmetry that would be visible event - by - event in an electric dipole moment",
    ". however , in this proposal the transfer of axial to electrical charge asymmetry involves physics that is not encoded in anomalous qcd hydrodynamics and that has not been elaborated on in a dynamical framework so far .",
    "although the mechanism is conceivable on general grounds , its efficiency in generating an electric charge difference is thus difficult to quantify .",
    "this is different for the mechanism of electric charge separation via the chiral magnetic wave ( cmw ) , proposed more recently in refs .",
    "first , the main experimental signature for the cmw is an electric quadrupole moment  @xcite , rather than the electric dipole moment considered in ref .",
    "second , the cmw is an unavoidable consequence of qcd hydrodynamics coupled to qed that follows from general principles without any model - dependent assumption ( this can be seen e.g. from our generalization of the cmw to expanding fluids in section  [ sec2 ] below ) .",
    "thus , there is a controlled model - independent dynamical framework , namely hydrodynamics , within which one can discuss the efficiency of the proposed mechanism of electric charge separation in heavy ion collisions .   and  [ sec4 ] , we shall typically work with initialization times @xmath8 fm / c .",
    "we regard the extrapolation of hydrodynamics to these early times as the best possible dynamical formulation of the cmw available at present .",
    "given that the main conclusions of sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] depend only on the logarithmic order of magnitude of charge separation , there is an a posteriori argument that the inclusion of non - equilibrium effects at early times should not affect these conclusions significantly . ]",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to contribute to this discussion .",
    "our work is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we derive the equations of motion of the chiral magnetic wave as a charge perturbation for the simplified case of an expanding bjorken - type model .",
    "we explain how this leads to a transparent model in which the efficiency of electric charge separation in response to an external magnetic field can be studied analytically and numerically . after discussing in section  [ sec3a ] an approximate analytical solution of the chiral magnetic wave that reveals already the main features of the full solution",
    ", we turn in sections  [ sec3b ] and  [ sec4 ] to a numerical study of how efficient the chiral magnetic wave is in separating electric charges .",
    "we discuss how our results are related to ( and consistent with ) previous discussions of the chiral magnetic wave , and we discuss conclusions .",
    "we consider a model of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath9 of hot qcd matter in an external electro - magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "this matter carries both electric charge ( written here in terms of the vector current @xmath11 ) and axial charge ( with axial current @xmath12 ) .",
    "the electro - magnetic field couples to the vector current , and it determines the divergence of the anomalous axial current . the fluid dynamic equations of motion of this system read @xmath13 where the external electric and magnetic field is defined via a tensor decomposition of @xmath10 with respect to the flow field @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the coefficient @xmath17 denotes the strength of the abelian anomaly . in the following @xmath18",
    "and we use for simplicity a vector charge @xmath19 .",
    "this neglects that different quark flavors carry different fractional electric charge .",
    "( to avoid this simplification , one would have to introduce flavor - dependent currents and chemical potentials . )",
    "it will be sometimes convenient to work in the basis of left- and right - handed currents , @xmath20 requiring that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied locally , i.e. that the divergence of the entropy current is positive semi - definite everywhere , one can write equations ( [ eq1 ] ) explicitly in the gradient expansion of viscous fluid dynamics . following son and surowka  @xcite , the energy momentum tensor and",
    "currents read to first order  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 here , the non - ideal part @xmath23 of the energy - momentum tensor is characterized by the shear viscous transport coefficient @xmath24 and the bulk viscous coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "up to first order , @xmath23 can be written in terms of gradients of the flow field @xmath14 and the projector @xmath26 .",
    "the viscous part @xmath27 of the left- and right - handed currents @xmath28 contains a conventional term that is proportional to the vector charge conductivity @xmath29 .",
    "this contribution describes how the currents flow along an electric field or a gradient in the chemical potentials .",
    "what renders the hydrodynamics of the system ( [ eq1 ] ) anomalous is the second line of ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "we focus on the term that induces currents parallel to the magnetic field . following refs .",
    "@xcite but keeping all terms , we find @xmath30 here , the notation @xmath31 on the right hand side is a shorthand denoting @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . in this compact notation , @xmath36 is an additional integration constant that , as first pointed out in  @xcite , is not constrained by the thermodynamic consistency relations for @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "the two terms proportional to @xmath38 arise from rewriting terms proportional to @xmath39 with the help of thermodynamic relations ; we assume that these terms are much smaller than the other two terms in ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "more generally , we shall consider in the following situations with small charge densities and small chemical potentials , such that @xmath40 usually , discussions of experimental signatures neglect the unknown but thermodynamically allowed function @xmath41 in equations ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "then , an external magnetic field induces an axial current in the presence of a finite vector charge density .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) .",
    "also , any time - dependent axial current will change the axial chemical potential @xmath2 , and it will thus induce a vector current @xmath42 .",
    "this is referred to as charge separation effect ( cse ) .",
    "the combination of both equations is the starting point for the discussion of the chiral magnetic wave ( cmw ) .",
    "one may wonder to what extent for small chemical potential and charge densities a non - vanishing function @xmath36 could change this picture . by construction",
    ", @xmath42 will remain unchanged , so charge separation along @xmath43 continues to take place for non - vanishing axial chemical potential .",
    "a negative term @xmath44 , however , would counteract the induction of the axial current , and a positive contribution would enhance it .",
    "we note that for the vortical effect , a corresponding term was found to be non - vanishing in a holographic model  @xcite . here , we follow common practice and we neglect contributions proportional to @xmath36 , but we argue that a better understanding of these terms in qcd is desirable .      for the strongly expanding system created in heavy ion collisions , the solution of the equations of motion of viscous relativistic fluid dynamics is complicated , and a fully realistic treatment requires numerical simulations .",
    "however , analytically treatable models , and in particular bjorken - type models , have contributed in the past towards anticipating and understanding results of full fluid dynamical simulations .",
    "we expect that they can also play a useful role in understanding the dynamics of the qcd fluid coupled to strong external electromagnetic fields , where numerical studies are at the very beginning  @xcite . to this end",
    ", we formulate and study here a simplified fluid dynamical model of the chiral magnetic wave that retains essential aspects of a strongly expanding fluid .",
    "in general , analytically treatable models of fluid dynamics assume additional symmetries in the initial conditions that are preserved during evolution and thus simplify the equations of motion .",
    "what is then simplified is not the dynamical treatment of the qcd fluid , but the description of the initial conditions under which this fluid is prepared . in practice",
    ", the symmetries assumed to this end in bjorken - type models  @xcite are longitudinal boost - invariance and invariance under azimuthal rotations or under transverse translations . if all these symmetries are invoked , one arrives at a 1 + 1 dimensional model that is analytically solvable in ideal and first order viscous fluid dynamics .",
    "there is also a generalization of bjorken - type models due to gubser  @xcite , with analytical solutions of fluid dynamics that satisfy conformal symmetry .    formulating a simplified model of the chiral magnetic wave is complicated",
    "since the phenomenon breaks all symmetries on which simplifications of fluid dynamics are typically based : a realistic magnetic field is not bjorken boost - invariant and the resulting fluid dynamic response breaks symmetry under rotations in the transverse plane .",
    "to arrive at a model requires therefore to make simplifying assumptions not only about the initial conditions but also about the dynamical treatment of the qcd fluid .",
    "the main assumption in the following will be that the axial and vector charge densities and the corresponding chemical potentials are parametrically small so that one can treat them as symmetry - breaking perturbations that have a negligible effect on the energy density and pressure of the system .",
    "this assumption can be realized for a qcd fluid whose energy density is dominated by gluonic degrees of freedom , and for which net charge densities and associated chemical potentials are small .",
    "one can then consider energy density and pressure as providing parametrically large background fields for which initial conditions and subsequent evolution satisfy the symmetries of bjorken s model to leading order in @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , to leading order in @xmath45 , the velocity @xmath46 that defines the rest frame of the energy density @xmath47 takes at all space - time points the boost - invariant form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the beam direction , @xmath50 the proper time and @xmath51 the space - time rapidity .",
    "charges propagate as small perturbations ( subleading in @xmath45 ) on top of this bjorken background field , and their propagation is seen in the dissipative parts @xmath52 of the currents as well as in the position dependence of the charge densities @xmath53 in ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "it is only these latter terms that break the symmetries of the bjorken model in response to an external magnetic field .    for a constant external magnetic field @xmath54",
    ", we can write to leading order in @xmath45 eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) - ( [ eq6 ] ) as four equations for the energy density @xmath55 and pressure @xmath56 , ( we use @xmath57 ) @xmath58 and two equations for the time evolution of the charge densities , @xmath59 these equations are not yet self - consistent since they were derived assuming longitudinal boost - invariance for @xmath46 , @xmath56 and @xmath55 while they contain terms with explicit @xmath51-dependence that break longitudinal boost - invariance . the reason for this is , of course , that ( [ eq10])-([eq14 ] ) were derived for a constant magnetic field @xmath54 that breaks longitudinal boost - invariance . to obtain a consistent ,",
    "longitudinally boost - invariant set of differential equations , we could choose either a magnetic field of longitudinally boost - invariant form that coincides at @xmath60 with the physical value of @xmath54 at mid - rapidity .",
    "this would give rise to a consistent dynamics that is physically meaningful at @xmath60 .",
    "equivalently , we can simply limit our discussion of equations ( [ eq10])-([eq14 ] ) to the transverse plane at space - time rapidity @xmath60 , for which all terms on the right hand side of equations ( [ eq10])-([eq13 ] ) vanish . for the terms @xmath61 and @xmath62 , this follows from the fact that even in the presence of a constant magnetic field , the system is symmetric under translation in the transverse direction orthogonal to the magnetic field and under reflection @xmath63 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "we therefore find for energy density and pressure the equations of motion of the bjorken model to first order in viscous hydrodynamics , @xmath64 supplemented by a simple time evolution for the charge densities , @xmath65 equations ( [ eq15])-([eq17 ] ) are the starting point of the following discussion .",
    "we recall tht they provide a simplified consistent dynamical treatment if restricted to mid - rapidity .",
    "the following analytical and numerical studies will be limited to the case where the energy density is translationally invariant in the transverse @xmath66-plane and where the charge distributions are invariant in the transverse direction @xmath67 orthogonal to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the advantage of translation invariance with respect to @xmath67 is that we arrive at a very transparent model for the efficiency of electric charge separation via the cmw .",
    "equation ( [ eq17 ] ) describes the hydrodynamic propagation of chiral charge density in a bjorken - expanding background . to make contact with earlier discussions of the chiral magnetic wave , we work in the limit of small chemical potential when @xmath68 keeping only the dominant first term of equation ( [ eq7 ] ) , @xmath69",

    "@xcite for the case of a static medium .",
    "indeed , inserting the velocity profile for a time - independent medium , @xmath73 , into ( [ eq19 ] ) one finds the form discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath74 the main features of charge transport in a static medium can be inferred from general considerations without explicit calculation .",
    "in particular , one knows that the velocities @xmath14 , @xmath75 of the fluid dynamic frames comoving with energy density ( landau frame ) and with a charge density ( eckhart frame ) are related in first order hydrodynamics by the linear relation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath76 the velocities of charge transport are then given by the difference between the velocity that defines the landau frame of comoving energy energy density and the eckhart frames of comoving left ( + ) or right ( - ) handed charge densities . inserting the above relations ,",
    "one checks easily the expectation that the velocity of charge transport @xmath77 is determined by the transverse boost from the landau frame of comoving energy density to the eckhart frame that comoves with left ( + ) or right ( - ) handed charges .",

    "the physical motivation for exploring this possibility is two - fold .",
    "first , for a non - vanishing initial axial charge density distribution as the one shown in the lower panel of fig",
    ".  [ fig6 ] , vector charge separation can be expected to be dynamically more efficient since a sizable finite axial chemical potential needed for vector charge transport is present from @xmath104 onwards and does not need to be generated dynamically from gradients of the vector charge distribution .",
    "second , as pointed out in particular in the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the non - conservation of the axial current @xmath181 may provide a source for a spatial asymmetry of @xmath182 along the direction of @xmath54 .",
    "this is so , if one starts from a picture of the heavy ion collision in which there is not only a strong @xmath54-field , but also a strong electric field @xmath183 , and if the @xmath183-field is directed preferentially along ( opposite ) @xmath54 in the positive ( negative ) transverse half - plane @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) , as one expects from general geometric considerations . in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite , such a term was included in the dynamical evolution .",
    "we recall that the chiral magnetic wave leads to spatial asymmetries of the axial charge in response to a finite vector charge chemical potential , and it does not require a finite @xmath183-field .",
    "in contrast , a creation of spatial asymmetries in @xmath103 from @xmath181 requires a finite @xmath183-field but does not depend on a finite vector charge chemical potential . here , we do not address the important question about the size of the spatial asymmetries in @xmath103 that may be created by this alternative mechanism , nor do we discuss the time scale on which such an asymmetry may arise in the collision . rather , we simply accept the logical possibility that a finite spatial asymmetry of @xmath103 along @xmath54 may be present in the initial conditions and we ask how efficient the cmw could be in transfering this spatial asymmetries in @xmath103 into a spatial separation of the vector charge distribution .",
    "to this end , we have repeated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the calculation shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the same input values and the same initial vector charge density @xmath186 , but for the non - vanishing axial charge density @xmath187 shown in fig .",
    "we find that - although the signal is still numerically small - it is enhanced by almost 5 orders of magnitude compared to the case in fig .",
    "this supports the general argument that the mechanism of vector charge separation due to the chiral magnetic wave is significantly more efficient if a finite axial chemical potential needs not be generated dynamically but is present in the initial conditions .",
    "we further observe that for a given @xmath162-dependence of the initial asymmetry @xmath187 , the size of the vector charge separation grows approximately linearly with the amplitude of @xmath187 .",
    "in fact , rescaling @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] by a factor 100 ( which for the parameters chosen here still corresponds to @xmath188 everywhere ) , we find that the relative size of the normalized vector charge difference @xmath168 increases by a factor @xmath189 as well .",
    "we note as a speculative aside that if one starts from the numerical finding that the peak values of @xmath190 reached in heavy ion collisions are @xmath191 and _ if _ one assumes that @xmath192 , then the non - conservation of the axial current is parametrically large , @xmath193 and large initial values for @xmath103 may be feasible indeed .",
    "the chiral magnetic wave is a direct and unavoidable consequence of formulating qcd hydrodynamics in an external electromagnetic field",
    ". experimental confirmation of this phenomenon would be of considerable interest since it would underline the relevance of quantum anomalies for the properties of hot and dense matter .",
    "however , whether the chiral magnetic wave can lead to unambiguous signals of experimentally accessible strength in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions ( and whether the cmw can offer a dynamical explanation for experimental signals of given strength ) is a question that requires theoretical exploration . in the present paper",
    ", we have shown that in an expanding fluid and for small charge densities , the chiral magnetic wave separates axial charges with a local velocity @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the strength of the axial anomaly and @xmath89 is a factor of order @xmath196 in the equation of state ( [ eq25 ] ) .",
    "for the special case of a fluid that satisfies to leading order in @xmath45 the symmetries of bjorken s model and where propagating charges can be treated as perturbations at subleading order in @xmath45 , we have derived explicitly the equations of motion for the chiral magnetic wave and the velocity ( [ eq38 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have argued on general grounds that we expect equation ( [ eq38 ] ) to describe the cmw - induced velocity of charge separation also for fluids whose collective expansion differs from that of the bjorken - type model studied in sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] .    for choices of the magnetic field strength and of the time - dependent temperature that are realistic for ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , the values found for @xmath78 from ( [ eq38 ] )",
    "are non - relativistic , and the resulting time - integrated value of the spatial separation of right- and left - handed charges tends to be very small , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for the simplified bjorken - type model studied in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the cmw therefore typically induces asymmetries in the electric charge distribution that we regard as being too small to be experimentally accessible since they affect on average the distribution of much less than one charge per collision .",
    "this conclusion is reached on the basis of a simplified model . while numerical results may change somewhat for the case of a fully realistic fluid dynamic simulation of relativistic heavy ion collisions",
    ", we emphasize that our main conclusion is based on the logarithmic order of the asymmetry of charge separation ( @xmath197 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) - a more realistic simulation alone is unlikely to overcome this big suppression factor . as discussed in section  [ sec4",
    "] , however , there may be physics effects that are different from the chiral magnetic wave and that enhance its phenomenological consequences .",
    "the findings of section  [ sec4 ] therefore call for a better understanding of the initial conditions with which the cmw is initialized .    _ acknowledgements .",

    "<S> as a consequence of the chiral anomaly , the hydrodynamics of hot qcd matter coupled to qed allows for a long - wavelength mode of chiral charge density , the chiral magnetic wave ( cmw ) , that provides for a mechanism of electric charge separation along the direction of an external magnetic field . here </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the efficiency of this mechanism for values of the time - dependent magnetic field and of the energy density attained in the hot qcd matter of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the cmw equations of motion for expanding systems by treating the cmw as a charge perturbation on top of an expanding bjorken - type background field in the limit @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> both , approximate analytical and full numerical solutions to these equations of motion indicate that for the lifetime and thermodynamic conditions of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions , the efficiency of cmw - induced electric charge separation decreases with increasing center of mass energy and that the effect is numerically very small . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that if sizable oriented asymmetries in the axial charge distribution ( that are not induced by the cmw ) are present in the early fluid dynamic evolution , then the mechanism of cmw - induced electric charge separation can be much more efficient . </S>"
