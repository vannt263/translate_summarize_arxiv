    "the dotted ( blue ) curves of the diagrams were built only for one value of the radiative cooling function of the shocked material , i.e. @xmath44 which is valid for a diffuse gas with a temperature @xmath45 100 k and ionization fraction @xmath46 10@xmath47 .",

    "31 ) which in turn , can vary by two orders of magnitude depending on the value of the ionization fraction of the cloud gas , we have presently plotted in the diagrams three different dotted ( blue ) curves in order to cover a more realistic range of possible ionization fractions from 0.1 to 10@xmath47 , corresponding to @xmath37 ( lower dotted curve ) , @xmath48 ( middle curve ) , and @xmath39 erg @xmath40 s@xmath41 ( upper dotted curve ) , respectively ( see dalgarno & mccray 1972 ) . the lower dotted ( blue ) curve ( larger ionization fraction )",
    "bounds the dark shaded zone , while the upper one ( smaller ionization fraction ) bounds the light shaded zone of the diagrams .",
    "the middle dotted ( blue ) curve corresponds to the average value of @xmath49 in the range above , @xmath48 erg @xmath40 s@xmath41 , and could be taken as a reference .",
    "2 .   in the solution presented in the original manuscript for the cloud with @xmath50 1 pc ( top panel of the figure ) , there was no permitted shaded zone where induction of star formation by snr - cloud interaction would be allowed . according to the present corrections and modifications",
    ", we see that a very thin shaded `` star - formation unstable '' zone appears now when the cooling function @xmath49 has values which are smaller than @xmath48 erg @xmath40 s@xmath41 , or ionization fractions @xmath51 .",
    "the cross labeled in the bottom panel of the figure for a @xmath50 20 pc diffuse cloud corresponds to the initial conditions of the numerical simulations presented in figure 6 of the original manuscript ( that is , for a snr at a distance @xmath52 42 pc from the surface of the cloud ) . in the original manuscript , that cross lies outside the unstable shaded zone just above the upper limit for a complete shock penetration into cloud ( the dotted , blue line of the diagram ) . with the present modifications ,",
    "the cross now lies near the upper limit of the dark shaded unstable zone for values of the cooling function @xmath53 erg @xmath40 s@xmath41 , or ionization fractions @xmath54 .",
    "this result remarks how sensitive the analytical diagrams are to the choice of @xmath49 ( or the ionization fraction ) for a given initial temperature cloud .",
    "according to the radiative cooling chemo - hydrodynamical simulations of figure 6 of the original manuscript ( which corresponds to the cross in the diagram ) , the snr shock front really stalls within the cloud before being able to cross it completely and after all the shocked cloud material does not reach the conditions to become jeans unstable , as predicted , but the dense cold shell that develops may fragment and later generate dense cores , as suggested in the original manuscript .",
    "this points to an ambiguity of the results due to their sensitivity to @xmath49 and the real ionization fraction state of the gas .",
    "we should also remark that the constraint established by the dotted ( blue ) curves in the diagrams is actually only an upper limit for the condition of penetration of the shock into the cloud . in order to estimate the density of the shocked material at the time @xmath55 when the shock stalls within the cloud ( see eq .",
    "31 of the original manuscript or eq .",
    "15 of this erratum ) , we have assumed pressure equilibrium between the shocked and the unshocked cloud material .",
    "a quick exam of the numerical simulations of figure 6 , however , shows that the shock front stalls before this balance is attained .",
    "this implies that the time @xmath55 should be smaller and therefore , the dotted ( blue ) curves in the diagrams should lie below the location predicted by eq .",

    "<S> this is an erratum to the article entitled `` star formation triggered by sn explosions : an application to the stellar association of @xmath0 pictoris '' by c. melioli , e. m. de gouveia dal pino , r. de la reza and a. raga which was published in this journal ( mnras , 373 , 811 - 818 , 2006 ) with the following original abstract :    in the present study , considering the physical conditions that are relevant interactions between supernova remnants ( snrs ) and dense molecular clouds for triggering star formation we have built a diagram of snr radius versus cloud density in which the constraints above delineate a shaded zone where star formation is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed fully 3-d radiatively cooling numerical simulations of the impact between snrs and clouds under different initial conditions in order to follow the initial steps of these interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the conditions that may lead either to cloud collapse and star formation or to complete cloud destruction and find that the numerical results are consistent with those of the snr - cloud density diagram . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have applied the results above to the @xmath1 pictoris stellar association which is composed of low mass post - t tauri stars with an age of 11 myr . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently suggested that its formation could have been triggered by the shock wave produced by a sn explosion localized at a distance of about 62 pc that may have occurred either in the lower centaurus crux ( lcc ) or in the upper centaurus lupus ( ucl ) which are both nearby older subgroups of that association ( ortega and co - workers).using the results of the analysis above we have shown that the suggested origin for the young association at the proposed distance is plausible only for a very restricted range of initial conditions for the parent molecular cloud , i.e. , a cloud with a radius of the order of 10 pc , a density of the order of 10@xmath220 @xmath3 , and a temperature of the order of 10@xmath2100 k    .    </S>",
