    "a decade of experimental signals@xcite for qcd hybrids ( in particular with @xmath0 ) has culminated in the claimed observation of three such states at brookhaven@xcite in the last year .",
    "the question of the nature of qcd hybrids has thus become topical .",
    "furthermore , lattice gauge calculations are now at the point of accurately determining light hybrid masses . in view of these developments",
    ", it is of interest to compare models of strong ( low energy ) qcd with lattice data to determine their viability and to explicate and guide current experimental efforts .",
    "it is often stated that a hybrid is a hadron consisting of valence quarks and glue .",
    "however , one must specify what is meant by the notion of valence glue for this statement to be useful .",
    "there are two broad ideas in this regard : it is some sort of string or flux tube@xcite or it is an effective constituent confined by a bag@xcite or potential@xcite .    as an example of the importance of choosing correct degrees of freedom , we mention the simple problem of determining the number of components of a constituent gluon .",
    "it has been suggested that a massive constituent gluon should be transverse so as to maintain consistency with yang s theorem@xcite .",
    "however it was noted that this is inconsistent with the requirements of lorentz invariance .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath1 glueballs are expected to exist and lattice calculations indicate that they are quite heavy ( roughly 3 gev)@xcite .",
    "such a state may not be constructed from two transverse constituent gluons ( yang s theorem ) and therefore may be expected to have a mass of roughly @xmath2 gev .",
    "however massive vector gluons have no such constraint and one therefore expects them to have a mass of approximately @xmath3 gev .",
    "the nature of the appropriate effective degrees of freedom for glue can only be determined by a long process of calculation and comparison with experimental and lattice data .",
    "there are , however , a few indications that low energy glue is string - like .",
    "perhaps the most compelling of these are lattice calculations of energy , action , or field densities between static color sources which are reminiscent of flux tubes@xcite .",
    "an intriguing clue is also provided by the spin splittings of heavy quarkonia . it is known that an effective interaction free of long range exchange spin - orbit coupling is needed to reproduce the mass splitting of the @xmath4 heavy quarkonium multiplets",
    ". however , an analysis of qcd in the heavy quark limit convincingly demonstrates that obtaining such an effective potential requires that low energy glue must be string - like@xcite .",
    "alternatively , pointlike models of low energy glue have a long history , originating with mit bag model calculations of barnes@xcite and others@xcite .",
    "horn and mandula@xcite were the first to consider a potential constituent glue model of hybrids .",
    "their hybrids consisted of constituent quarks and pointlike , massless , spinless , and colorless glue in a nonrelativistic potential model .",
    "the confining potential was taken to be linear with a string tension given by the ratio of color casimir operators : @xmath5 .",
    "the authors noted that the two body @xmath6 potential is anti - confining in the color octet channel and has a repulsive coulomb spike at short distances .",
    "they argued that this is unphysical and hence choose to neglect this term in the interaction .",
    "it is clear that a great many simplifying assumptions have gone into the construction of this model .",
    "it is our purpose to compare a more sophisticated version of the model to lattice data to learn something about these assumptions .    in the following",
    "we employ a model field theoretic hamiltonian of qcd .",
    "the model incorporates linear confinement at low energy and evolves into perturbative qcd at high energy .",
    "a nontrivial vacuum is used to generate constituent quark and gluon masses .",
    "the eigenvalue equation is derived for a @xmath7 system where the quarks are static .",
    "the resulting adiabatic potential surfaces are then compared to recent lattice results .",
    "we conclude that the simple picture of glue as a pointlike constituent particle reproduces the general behaviour of the lattice results but fails to yield the correct level orderings .",
    "furthermore , other models which regard the gluonic degrees of freedom as pointlike ( eg . , @xcite , @xcite ) do not contain sufficient degrees of freedom to generate all of the adiabatic surfaces .",
    "thus constituent glue models appear to fail to describe hybrids .",
    "this stands in contrast to string or bag - like models which , although disagreeing on details , capture the rough structure of the lattice data .",
    "the starting point for our description of hybrids is the following model hamiltonian :    @xmath8 \\psi({\\bf x } )   + { 1\\over 2 } \\int d{\\bf x } \\left [ |{\\bf e}^a({\\bf x})|^2 +   |{\\bf b}^a(x ) |^2   \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   & + & { 1\\over 2}\\int d{\\bf x } d{\\bf y } \\rho^a({\\bf x})v(|{\\bf x } -   { \\bf y}| ) \\rho^a ( { \\bf y})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the color charge density is @xmath9 and the potential is given by    @xmath10    and @xmath11 .",
    "the quark mass appearing in this hamiltonian is the current mass . to be phenomenologically successful",
    ", constituent quark masses must be generated in some way .",
    "this may be achieved by employing a bcs vacuum ansatz ; the gap equation which follows from minimizing the vacuum energy density , @xmath12 , ( where @xmath13 represents the bcs trial vacuum ) gives rise to a low energy constituent quark mass of roughly 200 mev@xcite .",
    "a similar calculation in the glue sector yields a gluon dispersion relation which is well - approximated by    @xmath14    with @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 gev .",
    "one sees that a constituent gluon mass of approximately 800 mev has been generated@xcite .",
    "hadrons are then constructed on top of the bcs vacuum @xmath13 by employing a basis truncation ( typically tamm dancoff or random phase ) and solving the resulting bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "this approach has been used to derive the low lying spectrum of glueballs and agrees remarkably well with lattice data@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the dynamical gluons are transverse so that yang s theorem holds and the difficulty mentioned in the introduction does not arise .    in the following ,",
    "the parameters of the model are fixed to the @xmath17 potential derived in the lattice calculation of juge , kuti , and morningstar@xcite ( see fig . 3 below ) .",
    "the fit yields @xmath18 and @xmath19 gev@xmath20 .",
    "the final parameter , @xmath21 serves as an ultraviolet cutoff on the linear confinement potential .",
    "its value was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting the gluon condensate , and will be set at 4 gev in the following .",
    "we shall consider the static quark limit in the remainder of this work so that quark masses ( and the quark sector of the bcs vacuum ) become irrelevant .",
    "the model presented here may be considered as a simplified version of the coulomb gauge qcd hamiltonian where the effects of nonabelian gauge couplings have been modeled by the linear confinement term .",
    "furthermore , second order transverse gluon exchange is suppressed by the heavy quark masses . in principle , this approach allows the elimination of the ultraviolet scale @xmath21 via renormalization .",
    "a method for achieving this which is appropriate for nonperturbative hamiltonian - based calculations is described in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the tamm dancoff approximation ,",
    "hybrids are constructed as @xmath22 excitations of the bcs vacuum . for the heavy hybrids considered here , the ( anti)quarks serve as static color sources ( sinks ) and the gluons are constituent particles as described above .",
    "we choose to work in the  diatomic molecule \" basis because this facilitates comparison with the lattice results of ref .",
    "thus the hybrid state may be written as    @xmath23    wigner rotation functions are written as @xmath24 in this expression , @xmath25 is the distance between the @xmath17 pair , @xmath26 is the gluon helicity , and @xmath27 is the radial hybrid wavefunction in momentum space .",
    "the gluon polarization wavefunction , @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the two cases , @xmath311 , -1 , represent transverse magnetic and transverse electric hybrids respectively . finally , @xmath32 is the projection of the gluonic angular momentum onto the @xmath17 axis , @xmath33 is the total angular momentum of the gluon , and @xmath34 labels the radial basis state .",
    "we note that employing helicity basis gluon creation operators makes this expression significantly more compact than the canonical basis .",
    "the salpeter equation which follows from this ansatz and the hamiltonian in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) may be obtained from the following matrix element :    @xmath35   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { 3 \\over 8 } \\int \\int d \\vec q d \\vec k\\ , \\varphi_{n_g ' j_g'}^*(k )   \\varphi_{n_g j_g}(k)\\ , v(k - q ) \\left [ { \\omega(k)^2 + \\omega(q)^2 \\over \\omega(k ) \\omega(q ) } ( 1 + ( \\hat q \\cdot \\hat k)^2 ) \\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & { 3 \\over 4 } \\int\\int d \\vec q d \\vec k\\ , \\varphi_{n_g ' j_g'}^*(q)\\varphi_{n_g j_g}(k ) \\ , v(k - q ) \\left({\\rm e}^{i { r\\over 2 } \\cdot ( k - q ) }   + { \\rm e}^{-i { r\\over 2}\\cdot ( k - q ) } \\right ) { \\omega(k ) + \\omega(q)\\over   \\sqrt{\\omega(k ) \\omega(q)}}\\times \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times { \\cal d}^{j_g*}_{\\lambda \\lambda'}(\\hat k )   { \\cal d}^{j_g'}_{\\lambda'\\sigma'}(\\hat q ) \\sqrt{2 j_g + 1 \\over 4 \\pi } \\sqrt{2 j_g'+1\\over 4 \\pi } \\chi_{\\lambda \\lambda'}^\\xi \\chi_{\\sigma \\sigma'}^{\\xi ' } { \\cal d}^1_{\\mu \\lambda}(\\hat k ) { \\cal d}^{1*}_{\\mu\\sigma}(\\hat q ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left({1\\over 6 } v(r ) + { 4\\over 3}v(0)\\right ) { \\cal n}_{n_g ' j_g ' n_g j_g } \\delta_{j_g ' j_g }   \\delta_{\\lambda ' \\lambda } \\delta_{\\xi ' \\xi } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an overall @xmath36 is understood and @xmath37 is the wavefunction normalization factor .",
    "the two extra wigner rotation matrices arise from converting the cartesian basis implicit in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) and in the expression for the color current to the helicity basis , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are canonical and helicity polarization vectors respectively .",
    "the first term in this expression is the gluon kinetic energy , the second is the gluon self energy , the third is the gluon potential , and the fourth is the @xmath6 potential and self energies for static quarks in a color octet .",
    "the presence of the gluon and quark self energies assures the infrared finiteness of the salpeter equation .",
    "this appears to be a general feature of color singlet states in our approach@xcite .",
    "the last task is to identify the diatomic quantum numbers used to label the states . in the jacob - wick convention the action of parity on glue",
    "is given by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the intrinsic gluon parity .",
    "thus the hybrid states given in eqn .",
    "( 4 ) are eigenstates of gluonic parity with    @xmath45    a reflection of the glue degrees of freedom through a plane containing the @xmath17 axis leaves the hamiltonian invariant and when acting on the states it takes @xmath46 . for @xmath47 one",
    "thus has doubly degenerate states .",
    "we call this operation @xmath48-parity and perform it by setting @xmath49 and taking @xmath50 which may be achieved by a parity operation followed by a rotation through @xmath51 about the y - axis . the action of @xmath48 on a single transverse gluon state , @xmath52 is therefore given by ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54 .",
    "for the states defined in eq .",
    "( [ basis ] ) one has    @xmath55    where the relations @xmath56 and @xmath57 were used .    for @xmath58 the y - diagonal states may thus be written as    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and ,    @xmath61    for @xmath62 we simply have ,    @xmath63    to allow for easy comparison with conventions used elsewhere , we summarize the transformation properties of @xmath64 states under total parity , @xmath65 , and charge conjugation @xmath66 , including the quark degrees of freedom .    @xmath67    @xmath68    where @xmath69 = @xmath70 = @xmath71 = -1 .",
    "the states introduced in eq .",
    "( [ ybasis ] ) are therefore also eigenstates of combined @xmath72 , with    @xmath73    after dividing out the quark portion of @xmath72 we are left with    @xmath74      the salpeter equation is solved by expanding the radial wavefunction in a complete basis and by diagonalizing the resulting hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the evaluation of the matrix elements is greatly facilitated by performing the angular integrals analytically .",
    "furthermore , we found it expedient to do the remaining numerical integrals with the potential in position space since the integrand is less oscillatory for large argument in this case . the plane waves and potential were expanded in a double series of wigner functions yielding a total of ten wigner functions .",
    "the angular integral then evaluates to a sum over a product of six clebsch - gordon coefficients .",
    "as discussed above eigenstates of the hamiltonian may be labelled with the projection of the angular momentum onto the @xmath17 axis , the product of gluonic parity with charge conjugation , @xmath75 and the y - parity eigenvalue .",
    "for @xmath58 the two y - parity eigenstates are degenerate .",
    "states are therefore denoted by @xmath76 where @xmath77 are denoted by @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ; @xmath81 = @xmath82 or @xmath83 for even or odd parity respectively ; and @xmath84 = @xmath85 . the total gluonic angular momentum",
    ", @xmath33 is not a good quantum number .",
    "we have found however , that the sum over radial basis states and gluon angular momentum saturates quickly .",
    "for example , fig 1 . shows the ( approximately ) exact wavefunction for @xmath86 with @xmath87 and a variational single gaussian orbital . the next contribution to the @xmath86 eigenstate",
    "has @xmath88 , this is shown as the dotted line in the figure . evidently the eigenstate is dominated by the lowest gluonic angular momentum component and the single gaussian approximation is quite accurate .",
    "this remains true for all @xmath25 studied here , with the @xmath88 component rising to 13% of the wavefunction for @xmath89 gev@xmath90 .",
    "these observations support traditional approximations made for hybrids : the use of simple gaussian wavefunctions @xcite and the truncation of the adiabatic schrdinger equation to lowest @xmath33@xcite .    to    fig .  1 .",

    "exact result ( dashed line ) , single gaussian approximation ( solid line ) , @xmath91 component ( dotted line ) .",
    "the results for the gluon spectrum are presented as a function of the static quark separation in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "they are plotted in terms of the lattice scale , @xmath92 = 2.32 gev@xmath90@xcite and the potentials have all been normalized by subtracting an overall constant given by @xmath93 . in figs .",
    "2a - c we compare the recent lattice results from ref .",
    "@xcite with the predictions of the flux tube model  @xcite .",
    "the flux tube model was motivated by the strong coupling limit of the qcd lattice hamiltonian .",
    "it is based upon a nonrelativistic , small oscillation approximation to motion of the colored links in a topological sector where there are no overlapping ( color representations of higher dimension ) or disconnected links . under parity ( charge )",
    "conjugation the spatial ( color ) orientation of lattice links is reversed , thus the nonrelativistic `` beads '' of the flux tube model are assumed to flip orientation with respect to the position of the quarks under parity and to have positive intrinsic charge conjugation parity .    the lowest solid line in fig .",
    "2a is a fit to the @xmath17 potential given by @xmath94 which corresponds to the ground state lattice @xmath95 potential .",
    "the other solid lines in fig .",
    "2 show the flux tube potential as given by    @xmath96    with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the latter represents the total number of right - handed ( @xmath99 ) and left - handed ( @xmath100 ) transverse phonon modes weighted by the phonon momentum ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "we note that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite included a coulomb term in this expression , which is incompatible with the lattice results .",
    "the flux tube model predicts the first excited @xmath102 to be split by @xmath103 from the ground states , and two degenerate @xmath104 and @xmath105 potentials at @xmath106 . in the flux tube model the lowest @xmath79 state",
    "is predicted to be the @xmath107 .",
    "it is split from the @xmath6 ground state by @xmath108 and is followed by the @xmath103 , @xmath109 potential .",
    "the two lowest @xmath80 states , @xmath110 and @xmath111 correspond to @xmath103 and @xmath106 respectively .",
    "the flux tube model fits the first excited state , @xmath107 quite well over a wide range of the quark separation .",
    "it is , however , the only surface to do so at small distance .",
    "furthermore , this may be a fluke due to the particular choice of the short distance cutoff of the @xmath112 term employed in ref .",
    "alternatively , at large distances , the system is expected to act like some sort of string with an excitation energy given by @xmath112 .",
    "the splittings do indeed appear reasonable for all the surfaces considered .",
    "it is , however , disconcerting that the @xmath79 surfaces diverge from the flux tube model predictions for @xmath113 .",
    "this must be taken as an indication that the simple flux tube model considerations fail for more complex gluonic configurations .    in fig.3a - c",
    "we plot the results of our calculations for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the @xmath80 potentials with the flux tube results ( solid lines ) for comparison .",
    "it is apparent that the @xmath109 surface lies below the @xmath107 surface while the @xmath111 lies below the @xmath110 .",
    "this is opposite to the lattice results , indicating that the model fails to reproduce the expected level orderings .",
    "the @xmath78 levels are also permuted with respect to the lattice calculations at small @xmath25 .",
    "we note , however , that the correct level orderings may be reinstated by simply flipping the intrinsic parity of the gluon ( set @xmath114 in the expressions above ) .",
    "the resulting surfaces agree reasonably well with the lattice at small distances .",
    "for example , the @xmath107 and @xmath109 potentials are roughly 1 and 2 at the origin in both calculations .",
    "we obtain values of approximately 3 and 3.5 for the @xmath111 and @xmath110 surfaces at the origin , similar to the lattice values of 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "the agreement persists to intermediate @xmath115 , after which it is apparent that the model results approach the linear regime much too quickly with respect to the lattice .",
    "this is a strong indication that more degrees of freedom become active as the quark separation increases beyond @xmath116 fm .",
    "this is certainly sensible from the flux tube model point of view , where a large number of degrees of freedom are necessary to construct string phonons .",
    "our results include the contribution due to direct interaction between the static quarks ( the last term of eqn .",
    "this term was set to zero by horn and mandula@xcite because it anti - confines and therefore may be expected to not produce a flux tube between the quarks .",
    "however , we note that it is responsible for producing a hybrid potential slope equal to that of the @xmath17 ground state potential , in keeping ( roughly ) with the lattice data .",
    "thus we have chosen to retain this term .",
    "note however , that this implies that there is a short distance repulsive coulomb spike which should appear at very short quark separation .",
    "the appearance of this spike is , however , unphysical because the hybrid may emit a gluon and convert into a @xmath17 color singlet and a low lying glueball and this is energetically favorable for small @xmath115 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath117 for @xmath118 fm .",
    "thus the coulomb spike mentioned above is irrelevant and one should see , instead , a coulomb core for small @xmath115 .",
    "this effect may be easily incorporated into the model presented here by allowing for coupling to the @xmath119 channel .",
    "notice that no core is visible in the lattice data ( especially in @xmath107 , which is measured down to @xmath120 fm ) .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite are currently examining this issue@xcite .    to    to    to",
    "the model presented here agrees moderately well with lattice calculations of adiabatic potential surfaces .",
    "however , it disagrees in detail . in particular",
    ", it is necessary to ignore the intrinsic parity of the gluon to obtain the expected level orderings .",
    "although one may argue that this is in keeping with the expectations for the parity of a lattice link operator ( such as is employed in the development of the flux tube model ) , the lack of consistency is disconcerting .",
    "furthermore , the model predicts surfaces which become linear too quickly with respect to the lattice .",
    "we expect this flaw to persist in all constituent glue potential models ( such as @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this is a strong indication that more degrees of freedom are required to describe soft glue at large interquark separation .",
    "it is important to note that models which employ single spinless gluons do not contain sufficient degrees of freedom to reproduce the potential spectrum . in particular ,  single bead \" flux tube models ( @xcite ) can not make @xmath109 or @xmath121 states while three dimensional bead models ( @xcite ) can not make @xmath122 states . thus including gluon spin is a minimal necessity in this class of models ( although the level ordering problem must be overcome as discussed above ) .",
    "we also note that it is possible for spherical bag models to reproduce the lattice calculations at small quark separation , but that they fail at large @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , flux tube model or nambu - goto string models@xcite reproduce the lattice reasonably well for intermediate to large quark separations , but do not perform well at small @xmath25 or in detail at large @xmath25 . in particular",
    "the potential separation does not appear to be the expected @xmath112 and the slopes do not appear to agree .",
    "finally , the bag model of ref .",
    "@xcite works reasonably well over all quark separations , although problems remain to be resolved in the @xmath78 states and for large @xmath25 .    in summary",
    ", it appears that some sort of flux tube is required to explain the lattice adiabatic hybrid potential surfaces at large quark separation .",
    "this is in keeping with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , where flux tubes were required to explain the spin splittings in heavy quarkonia . however , any flux tube model must attempt to incorporate the small @xmath25 behaviour of the potential surfaces ( and the seemingly anomalous behaviour at large @xmath25 ) .",
    "this appears to be an indication that different degrees of freedom are required at small distances ( as is incorporated in , for example , the bag model of ref .",
    "finally , the model presented here ( with the gluon parity reversal ) works moderately well in describing the potential surfaces and could provide a useful starting point to simple models of gluonic hadron properties ( note that the early transition to a linear potential seen in figs .",
    "3 should not be relevant since the hadron wavefunction is exponentially suppressed in this region ) .",
    "thus we expect that the success of the previous glueball spectrum calculation@xcite in this model ( where the gluon parity was irrelevant ) was not a fluke .",
    "several benefits of the model are particularly relevant to hybrids ; light quarks may be easily incorporated , the effects of coupled channels may be examined , and the effects of light quark coupling to virtual transverse or coulomb gluons may be included .",
    "the latter effect is of interest because it is excluded in quenched lattice calculations and may have a substantial effect on the hidden flavor hybrid spectrum .",
