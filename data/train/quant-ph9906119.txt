    "a major achievement was the coherent extraction of atoms from an atomic trap . at first",
    "a pulsed atom laser was built @xcite , recently also continuous wave atom lasers have been realized @xcite .",
    "a short survey over the experimental situation is given in @xcite .",
    "the theoretical treatment of an atom laser is usually based on the born - markov approximation @xcite , which has been used in quantum optics with great success .",
    "however , as it has been shown recently by moy and coworkers @xcite , this approximation fails in a realistic parameter regime . in this article",
    "we will outline a different approach , which is based on the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) projection operator technique @xcite to study non - markovian effects resulting from the output coupling .",
    "this technique is based on a perturbative expansion in powers of the output coupling strength .",
    "the master equation resulting from the perturbative expansion has a form similar to the born - markov master equation and is also local in time .",
    "this makes the equation of motion easy to solve . as we will see the second order perturbation theory corresponds to the born - markov approximation . by taking higher orders of the expansion non - markovian effects",
    "can be studied in a systematic way .",
    "it is demonstrated that the perturbative expansion holds in an intermediate coupling regime , which corresponds to realistic parameters , while the born - markov approximation fails for these parameters .",
    "this paper consists of two parts and is structured as follows . in section  [ pulsed_atom_lasers ]",
    "we investigate the validity of the time - convolutionless projection operator technique ( tcl ) for a pulsed atom laser .",
    "the model investigated was discussed by moy _",
    "they showed that the born - markov approximation fails for realistic parameters .",
    "we demonstrate that the time - convolutionless projection operator technique agrees with the exact solution for these parameters .",
    "afterwards we apply the tcl algorithm to a simple model of a continuous wave atom laser in section  [ cw_al ] .",
    "the numerical results obtained from a simulation using a perturbation expansion including 4th order clearly reveal strong oscillations in the occupation number of the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "as will be shown these oscillations can be interpreted as a quantum interference effect which clearly reveals departures from the golden rule and demonstrating the non - markovian dynamics of the atom laser .",
    "a short summary concludes the article .",
    "in this part we will investigate the dynamics of a pulsed atom laser .",
    "this means that there is an output coupling mechanism which transfers the atoms out of the trap but there is no pump mechanism which supplies the bec with new atoms .",
    "when the trap is empty it is replenished and a new cycle starts . therefore our starting point is an existing bec inside an atomic trap and we study only the output coupling .",
    "this part is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly introduce our atom laser model and derive the exact equation of motion for the expectation value of the atomic number operator of the bec in section  [ ex_sol ] . in section  [ b_m_sec ]",
    "we discuss the born - markov approximation .",

    "the superoperator @xmath3 is of lindblad form @xcite and is defined by @xmath4 in the markovian approach one obtains a master equation containing only system variables .",
    "two basic assumptions underlying the born - markov approximation are that ( i ) if the system and the reservoir are uncorrelated at the beginning they remain uncorrelated for later times and ( ii ) that the evolution of the system is markovian .",
    "the markovian property means that the future evolution of the system depends only on the present state and is independent of the previous history of the system . as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the born - markov approximation is not valid in a realistic parameter regime of atom lasers .",
    "we want to investigate a raman output coupler through state change , which was suggested by moy _",
    "two lasers are tuned to a two - photon resonance to couple an initial atomic state inside the trap to a final atomic state outside the trap . due to the conservation of linear momentum",
    "the atoms receive momentum kicks during the raman transitions which pushes the atoms out of the trap .",
    "if we assume that the lasers are detuned far from single photon resonances , then all initially empty modes of the atomic trap remain empty and we can neglect all modes besides the ground state mode occupied from the bec .",
    "in addition , we also ignore the effects of atom - atom interactions .",

    "after the mode 1 is occupied by more than one atom , two atoms can interact via the near resonant dipole - dipole interaction through which one atom is transferred to the weakly bound mode 2 and the other to the mode 0 of the atomic trap .",

    "such transitions are energetically unfavoured at low densities . moreover , since @xmath124 the strongly depleted mode 2 can be eliminated adiabatically  @xcite .",
    "we introduce an effective reservoir which describes the annihilation of two atoms in the mode 1 , the creation of an atom in mode 0 and 2 , and the immediate loss of the atom in the mode 2 .",

    "we see strong oscillations in the occupation number of the bec .",
    "note also , that in 4th order the mean occupation number increased compared to the stationary occupation number resulting from the born - markov approximation .",
    "if we reduce the coupling strength @xmath58 to @xmath164 , then there are only very weak oscillations around the stationary value obtained from the born - markov approximation and the fourth order perturbation theory agrees well with the second order expansion . in the case of the pulsed atom laser the born - markov approximation also failed for coupling strengths @xmath165 .    as expected this suggests that for the cw atom laser the parameter regime in which the tcl - algorithm is valid coincides with that of the pulsed atom laser . thus the parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are chosen such that the tcl algorithm to 4th order should provide reliable results .",
    "the depicted oscillations in the atom number can be interpreted as an interference effect between two favored transition modes .",
    "the physical origin of this interference phenomena can be seen already from the second order term @xmath146 which takes the form @xmath166 here the first factor of the integrand , namely the spectral density @xmath22 , has a @xmath167 singularity at @xmath24 [ see eq .",
    "( [ sp_den ] ) ] , whereas the second factor is concentrated around the ground state frequency @xmath168 .",
    "thus , the main contribution to this integral stems from transitions with frequencies near @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the corresponding transition amplitudes interfere and lead to the observed oscillations in the decay rate and therefore to the oscillations in the occupation number .    in a markovian system , where the spectral density of the coupling strength @xmath22 is bounded , the second factor of the integral ( [ osci ] )",
    "quickly approaches a @xmath171-function in the limit @xmath172 , and the oscillations decay on a time scale @xmath41 .",
    "this is known as fermis golden rule .",
    "in contrast , in the case of an atom laser , the contribution near @xmath169 is also important for long times .",
    "this can be seen by the asymptotic behavior of @xmath146 which can be evaluated explicitly from eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) and is given through @xmath173 according to this relation the decay rate @xmath146 approaches the markovian rate @xmath2 very slowly as @xmath174 .",
    "it is important to note that this behavior is due to the @xmath167 singularity of @xmath22 at @xmath24 which , in turn , is a direct consequence of the dispersion relation ( [ b_formel ] ) of massive particles .",
    "thus we observe that non - markovian effects decay only slowly in time with an algebraic behavior .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the golden rule limit @xmath2 is relevant only for extremely long times and shows the importance of a non - markovian treatment of the atom laser .    from eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) one clearly sees that the oscillations will also appear if we abandon the assumption @xmath175 .",
    "the function @xmath22 will then be peaked around @xmath176 but still has a @xmath167 singularity at @xmath169 .",
    "hence a significant contribution to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ osci ] ) comes from @xmath169 and , therefore , the time dependence of @xmath146 again shows an oscillatory behavior .",
    "these oscillations are also present in the case of the damped jaynes - cummings model with detuning ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but there they are damped exponentially .",
    "we have demonstrated that in the case of a pulsed atom laser with a raman output coupler in a realistic parameter regime in which the born - markov approximation fails , the time - convolutionless projection operator technique is able to reproduce the exact solution .    if we leave the intermediate coupling regime and take the 6th order terms in the output coupling strength we are able to render the exact solution for short times to about @xmath177 in the strong coupling regime .",
    "this short time behavior is important for the evaluation of correlation functions .",
    "the long time behavior after the first collapse of the atom number can not be reproduced with the tcl algorithm , because the decay rate diverges at such a point .    in the case of a cw atom laser",
    "we have chosen the coupling strength such that the perturbative expansion for the pulsed atom laser agreed with the exact solution for the considered times .",
    "we found strong oscillations of the occupation number of the bec and the mean atom number increased .",
    "our results clearly suggest that these oscillations survive for very long times because of the slow algebraic decay of the relaxation rate ."
