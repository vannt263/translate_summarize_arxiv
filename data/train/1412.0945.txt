    "the existence of a strong vhs in kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 is quite striking and may offer a consistent explanation to many surprising properties previously observed in this material .",
    "first , the existence of the four vhs points naturally explains the large enhancement of the sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state@xcite .",
    "one can see that there is a turning point of electronic specific heat _",
    "_ c__@xmath31/_t _ just at 0.5 k , below which a sharper drop appears .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that the large dos at _ _",
    "e__@xmath1 is contributed by the vhs but it is ungapped at and above 0.5 k. therefore , one can naturally conclude that the vhs plays only a passive role and is not the driving force of the pairing .",
    "our results are also qualitatively consistent with de haas van alphen measurements suggesting that the highest dos is coming from the most outer fermi surface around the @xmath17 point , namely the @xmath32 fermi surface as defined in our paper@xcite , while the largest superconducting gap appears at the inner hole pocket@xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that heavy mass has been reported@xcite in tlni@xmath3se@xmath3 , which is isostructural to kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 and for which arpes also revealed a vhs near _ _ e__@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the observation of the gapless behaviour in the dos near the vhs explains the origin of the nodal gap observed in this material@xcite .",
    "finally , the unusual pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature@xcite can possibly be understood as a lifshitz transition associated with the vhs .",
    "we note that such a lifshitz transition will not change the fermi surface volume by much since both fermi surface sheets connected by the vhs are hole - like .",
    "since there is no superconducting gap contributed from the vhs point , the observed _ _",
    "t__@xmath2 minimum under pressure can be consistently interpreted as correlated with a lifshitz transition .",
    "our observation of the low - energy vhs in kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 may have even more profound implications to the interplay between the vhs and superconductivity because such kind of vhs may enhance the instability towards superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetries .",
    "our data provide a strong constraint on the candidates of possible emergent pairing symmetries due to the vhs . despite the high dos near _ _",
    "e__@xmath1 due to the vhs , this dos is however not gapped at a temperature of 0.5 k , which is already quite low compared with _ _ t__@xmath2 .",
    "this is certainly counter - intuitive to the pairing mechanism based on the weak coupling picture because according to that scenario the superconducting gap can be expressed as @xmath33 exp@xmath34 , with dos @xmath35 at the fermi energy , _",
    "@xmath36 _ the pairing interaction mediated by exchanging bosons .",
    "therefore it is difficult to accept a simple mechanism based on the weak coupling picture for the pairing .",
    "in addition , two candidates for the gap symmetry have been popularly proposed in kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "one is the @xmath37 wave argued earlier@xcite and the other is _ _",
    "p__@xmath6+__ip__@xmath38 , which is possible because of the existence of the four type - ii vhs points in one bz@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , both pairing symmetries are inconsistent with our data because the superconducting gaps at the vhs point should be enhanced in both cases . however , our results are consistent with the scenario in which the @xmath39 pairing remains robust and unaffected by the vhs in such a heavily hole - doped material if we consider that the corresponding leading gap function is cos__k__@xmath27cos__k__@xmath20@xcite , which has nodal lines going through the four vhs points , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) .",
    "although the vhs occurs at about -3.8 mev from the fermi energy , but it is quite close to the latter , the finite broadness of the band dispersion can still give a finite dos at @xmath40 , which contributes the ungapped dos near the momentum @xmath41 point when the gap function is cos__k__@xmath27cos__k__@xmath20 .",
    "this scenario is further supported by our earlier arpes superconducting gap measurements in ba@xmath42k@xmath43fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( _ _ t__@xmath2 = 9 k ) @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the vhs induces an additional unconventional pairing that coexists with the s@xmath8 pairing , the likely candidate is @xmath23 , which also has nodal lines going through the four vhs points .",
    "in summary , we perform sts and arpes studies on the iron - based superconductor kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 . our observation of a pronounced vhs with large ungapped dos in the vicinity of _ _ e__@xmath1 in kfe@xmath3as@xmath3 points to the importance of the strong coupling mechanism .",
