    "gravitational waves have the potential of providing us with a unique telescope and a unique source of information about the very early universe .",
    "since the first calculation of the full spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves has been performed by allen @xcite , continuing and completing work by other authors , including grishchuk @xcite and starobinsky @xcite , rubakov , sazhin and veryaskin @xcite , as well as by fabbri and pollock @xcite , abbott and wise @xcite , and abbott and harari @xcite , a lot of research has been done in this direction , particulary into exploring the potentialities of different inflationary models .",
    "although the values obtained for the relative energy spectrum of the cosmological gravitational waves seem , at present , to be beyond the capabilities of the first generations of gravitational - wave detectors , this is a situation that is bound to be changed , given the effort that is being put into the planning of future detectors with considerably improved sensitivities like , for instances , nasa s big bang observatory ( bbo ) @xcite and the japanese deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo ) @xcite .",
    "an interesting question to ask is what can we learn about the physics of the very early universe , from the reading of the spectrum , assuming an ideal detector . in this article",
    ", we address this question with the help of a popular class of models , namely , power - law inflation .",
    "we shall show that , by looking at the interval of frequencies between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and also at the ghz range , important information can be obtained , about both the inflationary period and the thermalization regime .",
    "concerning the first range of frequencies , between @xmath0 and @xmath3 , important work , along the lines of our paper , had already been done @xcite , albeit by a different method , with similar conclusions to our own .",
    "most of the developments that have taken place in gravitational wave detectors cover the first range of frequencies , but work is also going on to study the possibility of constructing detectors covering the mhz and ghz range of frequencies @xcite .",
    "we deem these last developments to be very important , given the amount of information that can thereby be obtained , as we show with the help of a simple model for the transition between the inflationary and radiation - dominated eras .",
    "in this paper , we consider those gravitational waves generated by the usual mechanism of quantum fluctuations of the vacuum . in the mhz / ghz region another independent mechanism is possible , when the end of inflation is followed by a period of parametric resonance @xcite , in which case the gravitational waves are directly sourced by the large inhomogeneities in the matter distribution occurring during this period . in this paper",
    "we shall not address this important case , which has been investigated elsewhere @xcite , using both mechanisms .    throughout",
    ", gravitational wave production will be calculated using the method of continuously evolving bogoliubov coefficients .",
    "this method , applied to the production of particles in an expanding universe , was first investigated by parker @xcite . in the case of gravitational waves ,",
    "the differential equations determining the continuous bogoliubov coefficients were derived afterwards in a different , geometrical , way @xcite .",
    "the method of continuous bogoliubov coefficients has advantages over the frequently used sudden transition approximation .",
    "associated with the sudden transition there is always an overproduction of gravitons of large frequencies , requiring an explicit cut - off for frequencies above the rate of expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "this cut - off is obtained in a natural way by the use of continuous bogoliubov coefficients @xcite .",
    "this is also a very practical method to calculate the full spectrum , from the very low frequencies corresponding to the present cosmological horizon , till those large , ghz , frequencies associated with the transition between inflation and the radiation - dominated universe .",
