    "the characterization of galactic clusters on very large scales under the influence of their mutual gravitational interaction is a matter of vast interest .",
    "the importance of such a process can be exaggerated as the evolution and distribution of the galaxies throughout the universe are the main manifestations of this .",
    "the analysis of the correlation functions is one of the standard ways to study the formation of the universe .",
    "the observation tells us that the power law of two - point correlation function scales as @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xcite , which has also been approved by @xmath1-body computer simulations @xcite and by the analytic gravitational quasiequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the power law of the correlation function is based on the assumption that the conversion of the initial primordial matter into the observed many - body galaxies took place at the stage of evolution of the universe and these galaxies are coupled to the expansion of the universe .",
    "the theories of the many - body ( galaxies ) distribution function have been developed mainly from a thermodynamic point of view @xcite .",
    "theses theories utilize only the first two laws of thermodynamics to derive the exact equations of state of the expanding universe ( a quasiequilibrium evolution ) .",
    "the relation between thermodynamics and relativity was originated in the work of bekenstein @xcite , hawking @xcite , and unruh @xcite .",
    "later , jacobson established an important connection between thermodynamics and general relativity , by which the einstein equations themselves can be viewed as a thermodynamic equation of state under a set of minimal assumptions involving the equivalence principle and the identification of the area of a causal horizon with entropy @xcite .",
    "recently , verlinde proposed a constructive idea stating that gravity is not a fundamental interaction and can be interpreted as an entropic force @xcite .",
    "although this idea fails to provide a rigorous physical explanation @xcite , it surely opens a new window into understanding gravity from first principles .",
    "for instance , the modified newton s law @xcite , friedmann equations at the apparent horizon of the friedmann - robertson - walker universe @xcite , modified friedmann equations @xcite , newtonian gravity in loop quantum gravity @xcite , holographic dark energy @xcite , thermodynamics of black holes @xcite , and extension to coulomb force @xcite , etc .",
    "support the entropic interpretation of gravity .",
    "verlinde s approach to get newton s law of gravity relies on the entropy - area relation of black holes in einstein s gravity , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the entropy of the black hole , @xmath6 is the area of the horizon , and @xmath7 is the planck length . in order to include the quantum corrections to the area law , some modifications are required to the area law @xcite . in the literature ,",
    "the two well - studied quantum corrections to the area law are , namely , the logarithmic correction and power law correction .",
    "the logarithmic correction appears due to the thermal equilibrium fluctuations and the quantum fluctuations of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "however , the power law correction appears due to the entanglement of quantum fields sitting near the horizon @xcite .",
    "recently , combined corrections due to the logarithmic and volume terms are proposed for newton s law of gravitation as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the constants of the order of unity or less . here",
    ", the second term of the rhs corresponds to the logarithmic correction and the last term of the rhs corresponds to the volume correction .",
    "modesto and randono @xcite discussed how deviations from newton s law caused by the logarithmic correction have the same form as the lowest - order quantum effects of perturbative quantum gravity ; however , the deviations caused by the volume correction follow the form of the modified newtonian gravity models explaining the anomalous galactic rotation curves .",
    "in fact , on the very large ( cosmological ) scale , it is expected or otherwise speculated that the cosmological constant , as a prime candidate for dark energy , is responsible for the expansion of the universe through a repulsive force @xcite . if the effect of the cosmological constant in the newtonian limit of a metric is present in some phenomenon ( such as clustering of galaxies ) , then the same effect should also be present in the full general relativistic treatment of the same phenomenon . keeping the importance of the cosmological constant in mind , we want to employ the cosmological - constant - induced ( harmonic - oscillator - type ) modification to newton s law , which leads to the cosmic repulsive force .",
    "our motivation here is to study the effects of such corrections on the characterization of the clustering of galaxies on very large scales .",
    "the clustering of galaxies within the framework of modified newton s gravity through the cosmological constant only has been studied very recently@xcite .    to study the effects of the logarithmic , volume , and the cosmological constant corrections to the clustering of galaxies",
    ", we first derive the @xmath1-body partition function by evaluating configuration integrals recursively . from the resulting partition function ,",

    ", we derive the probability distribution function .",
    "the resulting distribution function depends on the modified clustering parameter .",
    "comparative analyses are made to see the effect of corrections on the probability distribution function . in this regard",
    ", we find that the corrected distribution function first increases sharply with the number of particles ( @xmath1 ) and gets a maximum ( peak ) value for the particular @xmath1 .",
    "as long as @xmath1 increases further beyond that particular value , the value of the distribution function starts descending very fast and becomes slow later .",
    "the peak value of the corrected distribution function decreases gradually with the increasing values of logarithmic and volume corrections .",
    "remarkably , the highly corrected distribution function starts dominating the lesser corrected distribution function after a certain value of @xmath1 . due to the cosmological constant term",
    ", the peak value of the corrected distribution function decreases even further and falls rather slowly .",
    "we compute the differential form of the two - point correlation function for both the cases of point - mass and extended - mass galaxies . by solving the corresponding differential equation",

    "finally , the discussions and conclusions are made in the last section .",
    "in this section , we consider a modified newton s law of gravitation due to the first - order corrections and study their effects on the partition function .",
    "it has been stressed @xcite that different quantum theories of gravity may lead to different higher - order corrections to the area law of bekenstein - hawking entropy .",

    "kaul and majumdar computed the lowest - order corrections to the area law in a particular formulation @xcite of a quantum geometry program .",

    "the quantitative discussions , like the particular scale on which these modifications will be important , are the subject of further investigation .",
    "remarkably , we note here that the power law still behaves as @xmath160 at leading order in the @xmath161 approximation .",
    "in order to study the clustering of galaxies in an expanding universe under the modified newton s law , we have considered a logarithmic , volume , and the cosmological constant modified newtonian potential .",
    "corresponding to this modified newtonian potential , we have calculated an explicit expression for the ( canonical ) partition function , which describes @xmath1 extended - mass galaxies , with the help of configuration integrals .",
    "our whole calculation is based on the assumption that the system ( ensemble ) , which is made of cells of the same volume @xmath28 and average density @xmath162 , has statistically homogeneous distribution over large regions . with the help of the resulting partition function ,",
    "we have derived various thermodynamical equations of state , namely , the helmholtz free energy , internal energy , pressure , entropy , and chemical potential equations of state . as a consequence of these exact equations of state , a corrected correlation ( clustering )",
    "parameter emerges naturally for the clusters of the galaxies with halos . here",
    ", we have found that the point - mass approximation is possible only for the volume correction but not for the logarithmic and @xmath0-induced corrections as the parameter @xmath74 only diverges in the point - mass approximation .",
    "nevertheless , this is not a serious threat as all the ( real ) galaxies are of finite size as described by the softening parameter @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , we have derived a modified version of the distribution function @xmath109 ( probability of finding @xmath1 gravitating bodies in volume @xmath28 ) for the gravitating system which follows the quasiequilibrium and , thus , resembles the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we note that the corrections on the distribution function are inherent in the clustering parameter .",
    "the behavior of these corrections on the distribution function @xmath109 is discussed through the plot ( see , e.g. , figs . 1 and 2 above ) , where we observe that the peak ( maximum ) values of @xmath109 ( at @xmath116 ) decrease as the correction dominates . as long as @xmath1 increases , after a certain value of @xmath1 the higher value of the correction starts dominating the smaller one because the values of @xmath109 decrease faster for smaller corrections .",
    "the presence of the cosmological constant , which is responsible for the expansion of the universe through a repulsive force , reduces the peak value ( at @xmath163 ) of the corrected distribution function even further , but makes the descent of the distribution function slower .",
    "we have also derived the two - point correlation function ( @xmath127 ) for the gravitating system under this modified newton s law for the cases of both point masses and extended masses . in this regard",
    ", we have first calculated the differential form of the modified two - point correlation function .",
    "the solution of the differential equation leads to the exact form of the two - point correlation function , where deviations from the original value are evident . in the limit @xmath146",
    ", the extended - mass two - point correlation function coincides to that of the point - mass case .",
    "the effect of corrections on the power law of the correlation function is also discussed and it has been found that it behaves as @xmath164 at leading order in a certain approximation , which is consistent with the result obtained in ref .",
