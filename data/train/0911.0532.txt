    "the formation of stars in the high - redshift universe occurred in a metal - poor environment .",
    "much of what we know about the process of star formation is deduced from observations in nearby , galactic star - forming regions with essentially solar metallicity .",
    "however , many of the physical processes that affect star formation and their observational diagnostics are expected to depend on metallicity , for instance cooling and gas - phase and grain surface chemistry .",
    "the nearest templates for the detailed study of star formation under metal - poor conditions are the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "the interstellar media ( ism ) of the large and small magellanic cloud ( lmc and smc ) have significantly lower metallicities ( @xmath4z@xmath5 and @xmath6z@xmath5 ) , than the solar neighborhood ism ( @xmath7 z@xmath5 ) .",
    "only relatively recently are we able to study the details of the star formation process in the mcs .",
    "the star - formation process is a complex interplay of various chemo - physical processes . during the onset of gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud",
    ", sufficiently dense cores can only develop if the heat produced during the contraction can be dissipated .",
    "the most efficient cooling mechanisms are via radiation through fine - structure lines of carbon and oxygen ( e.g. , via the emission lines of [ cii ] at 158@xmath1 m and [ oi ] at 63 and 146@xmath1 m ) , and rotational transitions in abundant molecules such as co , o@xmath8 and water @xcite .",
    "these cooling agents all contain at least one heavy atom  h@xmath9 has no permanent dipole moment , and emission through its rotational transitions is very unlikely , making it an inefficient coolant . besides also contributing to the thermal balance in the molecular cloud ,",
    "dust grains are crucial in driving cloud chemistry , as dust opacity shields molecules from radiation and grain surfaces enable chemical reactions to occur that would not happen in the gas phase .",
    "surface chemistry is also thought to play an important role in the formation of h@xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and h@xmath8o ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "simple theoretical arguments suggest that , even over the range covered by the milky way and the mcs , cooling and chemistry rates and timescales are affected by metallicity @xcite .",
    "not only is it crucial to understand the ism chemistry at low metallicity , it is also important to investigate the chemical evolution during the star formation process .    in cold molecular clouds , layers of ice form on the surface of dust grains . in particular , when densities increase dramatically during the cold collapse phase , most molecules accrete onto dust grain surfaces . in fact , as water , co , and also co@xmath8 are completely frozen out of the gas phase in these environments , ices are substantial reservoirs of the available oxygen and carbon ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "even if co seems to form exclusively in the gas - phase , there is laboratory evidence that water ice is predominantly formed by hydrogenation on icy grains @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding ice chemistry is crucial to understanding the gas - phase chemistry and the physical conditions within molecular clouds .",
    "water is by far the most abundant ice ( typically @xmath10 with respect to h@xmath8 ) , followed by co@xmath8 and co , with a combined abundance of 10@xmath230% with respect to water ice @xcite .",
    "other ice species have also been identified ( methanol , ammonia , ammonium , methane and formaldehyde ) , albeit in much smaller concentrations @xcite . while water and co can be observed from the ground , co@xmath0",
    "can only be observed from space and its ubiquitous presence in a variety of environments was one of the major discoveries of the _ infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) _ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is still unknown whether metallicity affects ice chemistry .",
    "the most obvious effect of a lower metal content is a reduced availability of carbon and oxygen , the cornerstones of interstellar chemistry . indeed",
    "the co abundance in the diffuse ism in the lmc is lower than that measured in galactic environments @xcite . in metal - poor clouds",
    ", it could be expected that ice abundances are generally depressed ( i.e. all ices could be less abundant as a result of lower abundances of c and o ) , but it is possible that the abundance balance of ice species is also reshaped . the lower dust : gas ratio should make cloud cores more transparent to ambient uv light , possibly exposing ices to more radiative processing , and making complex species more abundant than in the galaxy .",
    "interstellar ices have been detected in the envelopes of heavily embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the mcs .",
    "the first evidence of ices in the envelope of a massive yso in any extra - galactic environment was a serendipitous discovery by @xcite .",

    "three embedded ysos have been recently identified in the smc @xcite .",
    "there is a suggestion that the stronger uv radiation field @xcite and/or higher dust temperature @xcite could be responsible for a higher co@xmath8-to - water column density ratio observed towards a few ysos in the lmc when compared to galactic ysos @xcite .",
    "these studies are however hampered by small sample size and limited spectral resolution and thus not yet conclusive .",
    "co@xmath0 ice is found to be abundant and ubiquitous in a variety of molecular environments in the galaxy , from quiescent clouds @xcite to the envelopes of high- and low - luminosity ysos @xcite .",
    "this molecule is generally believed to form exclusively via surface reactions , even though its formation mechanism is not fully understood ( for a recent discussion of this issue see * ? ? ?",
    "the most prominent co@xmath0 solid state features are the 4.3-@xmath1 m stretching and 15.2-@xmath1 m bending modes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "comparisons of observed 15.2-@xmath1 m profiles with laboratory spectra suggest that co@xmath0 ices are dominated by components that are either water- or co - rich , rather than pure co@xmath0 @xcite . for some ysos , narrow substructure in the observed profiles",
    "provides evidence of thermal processing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the co@xmath0 ice profile is a sensitive probe of its molecular environment .",
    "another ice band in the irs range ( 5@xmath27@xmath1 m ) is less well understood , with contributions not only from water ice at 6@xmath1 m but also ammonia ( nh@xmath11 ) , methanol ( ch@xmath11oh ) , formic acid ( hcooh ) and formaldehyde ( ch@xmath0o ) ices @xcite .",
    "this superposition of multiple ice components is possibly responsible for the discrepancy between the column densities determined from the 3-@xmath1 m ( o@xmath2h stretching mode ) and the 6-@xmath1 m ( o@xmath2h bending mode ) water ice features , with the 6-@xmath1 m column density systematically higher @xcite .",
    "there is an ice feature at 6.8@xmath1 m attributed to ammonium ( nh@xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "this band also falls in a wavelength range strongly affected by emission features generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules .",
    "the libration mode of water ice is a very broad feature that peaks at 13@xmath1 m and extends between 10@xmath230@xmath1 m ; in practice this feature is very difficult to isolate both because of its width and the fact that it is hard to disentangle from the more prominent silicate dust features .    in a series of papers we will investigate ice chemistry in the envelopes of massive embedded ysos in the low metallicity environment of the mcs .",
    "the _ spitzer _",

    "the follow - up legacy program with the _ spitzer_-irs includes a variety of point and extended sources among which ysos feature prominently ( sage - spec , * ? ? ?",
    "we selected the lmc sample described here from both the sage - spec  program and the _ spitzer _  archive , as those objects that have spectral energy distributions ( seds ) consistent with early embedded ysos and exhibiting in their spectrum the absorption feature associated with co@xmath8 ice , the most prominent ice band in the _ spitzer_-irs spectral range .",
    "in this paper we present the first detailed analysis of co@xmath0 ice profiles for massive ysos in the lmc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce the sample and discuss the issues of continuum determination and constraining the pah spectrum .",
    "we then describe the observed co@xmath0 profiles in terms of laboratory components and measure column densities .",
    "we also investigate features in the 5@xmath27@xmath1 m range .",
    "finally we interpret our results in terms of possible effects of low metallicity .",

    "@xcite describe in detail the original target selection , observing strategy , and data reduction for the sage - spec  program ; we provide here only a brief summary .",
    "the irs observations of the point sources in sage - spec  were performed in staring mode , using the short - low and long - low modules ( sl and ll respectively ) .",

    ". archival spectra of lmc objects were re - reduced by the sage - spec  team to the same uniform standard as the sage - spec  sources .    when comparing spectra obtained with different instruments , and of objects at different distances , it is important to consider potential differences in the physical scales that are sampled .",

    "this study focuses on the least evolved , most embedded massive ysos in the lmc .",
    "embedded ysos can be selected based on their mid - ir colors . however , the colors and even broad - band seds of ysos are in some instances similar to those of evolved objects like planetary nebulae and post - agb stars .",

    "we have selected only objects whose nature is spectroscopically unambiguous , which also means that these objects are the most embedded and luminous .",
    "we initially identified yso candidates based on their very red continuum over the 5@xmath238@xmath1 m range .",
    "then we narrowed the sample to include only those objects that showed an indication of the co@xmath0 ice feature at 15.2@xmath1 m .",
    "co@xmath0 in the gas phase has been detected towards many agb stars ; co@xmath0 ice however is only observed in yso envelopes and quiescent molecular clouds ( section4.3 )  water ice is also observed in the envelopes of evolved stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the shape of the sed and the co@xmath0 ice feature unambiguously identify these objects as embedded ysos .",
    "we did not make use of the 5@xmath27@xmath1 m ice complex for sample selection , because this wavelength range is dominated by pah emission in our yso sample ( see below ) .",

    "more recently , @xcite classified this source as a yso based on its irac colors .",
    "the object s irs spectrum ( showing strong silicate absorption , weak pah emission , and a tentative ice detection ) and ir luminosity support the yso classification .",
    "msxlmc464 was tentatively identified as a possible hii region @xcite based on 2mass and msx colors .",

    "figure[spectra ] shows the spectra of the 15 objects analyzed in this work , covering the whole irs range .",
    "the insets show the spectral regions associated with the ice bands , co@xmath0 at 15.2@xmath1 m and the 5@xmath27@xmath1 m complex .",
    "objects are displayed in decreasing flux intensity at 5.8@xmath1 m .",
    "many objects show broad absorption at 10@xmath1 m ( and occasionally 18@xmath1 m ) attributed to silicate dust grains ; one object ( iras05240@xmath26809 ) shows silicate emission .",
    "pah emission is also present in many objects in our sample : the prominent 6.2- and 11.3-@xmath1 m pah features are easily identified in at least two thirds of the spectra .",
    "figure[spectra ] also shows that there are a variety of strength and profile shapes associated with the co@xmath0 ice and that few objects exhibit clear ice absorption at 6@xmath1 m . in the next sections we will analyze these features in more detail , starting with the issue of continuum determination .",
    "we have fitted the observed seds of the lmc ysos using the on - line fitting tool  developed by @xcite .",
    "this tool relies on a database of 20,000 pre - calculated models that are compared to the observed seds , and the best fit is selected using a @xmath24 minimization technique .",
    "@xcite explain these tools in more detail , and @xcite give examples of their use .",
    "a typical yso model includes a central stellar photosphere , a flared accretion disk , and a rotationally flattened infalling envelope with bipolar cavities , characterized by a total of 14 parameters .",
    "the balance of the different model components determines the object s evolutionary status .    to constrain the observed seds we made use of the irs spectrum discussed here as well as all the photometric data available for each object ( tables[targets1 ] & [ targets2 ] ) .",
    "the seds of 10 objects are described by @xcite ; for the remaining objects the results of the sed fits will be discussed in detail by chen et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the objects in the sample have estimated yso luminosities in the range @xmath135@xmath250@xmath1810@xmath25l@xmath26 and masses between @xmath1310 and 25m@xmath26 .",
    "taking into account their observed luminosity , the objects in our sample are the lmc counterparts of the luminous galactic ysos such as those studied by @xcite and @xcite with _ iso_. in terms of evolutionary stages the ysos are all in stage i , i.e they are still deeply embedded in their envelopes , as expected from the presence of ice absorption features .",
    "the stage i classification is equivalent to the classi as defined by @xcite , but instead of relying on the spectral index of the sed , it is based on modelled sed quantities , in this case the accretion rate of the envelope normalized to the stellar mass , _ m_@xmath27/@xmath28@xmath2910@xmath30yr@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir spectra of embedded ysos exhibit a wealth of solid - state and gas features super - imposed on a dust continuum : silicate absorption / emission features at 10 and 18@xmath1 m , pah emission features from 5 to 19@xmath1 m , molecular hydrogen and forbidden line emission across 5@xmath235@xmath1 m and finally the ice signatures we are interested in here . in our sample , 11 out of 15 objects show prominent pah emission ( look for the conspicuous 11.3-@xmath1 m feature in figure[spectra ] ) . as we want to measure ice optical depth , we need both to determine the continuum level and account for any emission or absorption features that fall in the desired spectral ranges .",
    "we fitted continua between 5 and 20@xmath1 m , focusing on obtaining good continuum determinations around 5@xmath27 and 15@xmath1 m .    determining a global ir continuum for ysos",
    "is not trivial .",
    "this is because the lines and bands listed above merge together , meaning that few true continuum points exist across the spectrum . as a consequence continuum fits rarely offer unique solutions .",
    "the co@xmath0 ice band at 15.2@xmath1 m is relatively narrow and falls in the region between the 11.3@xmath212.7@xmath1 m and 17-@xmath1 m pah complexes and between the silicate absorption bands .",
    "therefore , it is possible and practical to use a local continuum determination , for instance a low - order polynomial fitted to the local pseudo - continuum in the neighborhood of the ice feature .",
    "this is not the case for the 5@xmath27@xmath1 m ice band .",
    "first , there is prominent pah emission in this region , namely the 6.3-@xmath1 m feature and the 7.7-@xmath1 m complex , as well as unresolved h@xmath8 emission at 5.51 ( s7 ) , 6.11 ( s6 ) , and 6.91@xmath1 m ( s5 ) .",
    "@xcite show that relatively weak water ice signatures at 6@xmath1 m are difficult to separate from the pah emission contribution .",
    "secondly , this range falls at the edge of the irs spectrum , where the spectra are noisier .",
    "this means that it is very difficult if not impossible to find bona - fide continuum points to anchor a local pseudo - continuum determination .",
    "pahfit @xcite provides a convenient way of constraining the dust continuum and extinction as well as accounting for pah and gas emission .",
    "the dust continuum is modelled with up to eight thermal dust components represented by modified blackbodies of a range of temperatures ; dust extinction is produced by adopting extinction profiles similar to those of milky way dust .",
    "pah emission features are represented by individual and blended drude profiles  depending on whether pah complexes are resolved into their multiple components  with fixed widths and central wavelengths .",
    "molecular and atomic emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath8 pure rotational lines , forbidden line emission from [ s iii ] , [ ne ii ] , and [ ne iii ] etc ) are modelled as gaussian profiles ; their widths and central wavelengths are allowed to change to account for the fact that these lines are not resolved in the irs low - resolution spectra . to help pahfit constrain the continuum we added the irac 3.6- and 4.5-@xmath1 m photometric points to the irs range .",
    "the very broad water libration mode at 13@xmath1 m is treated as a component of the continuum in this approach . once all the pahfit components are accounted for ,",
    "we are left only with the ice contributions .",
    "figure[pahfit ] shows fits to the 11 ysos in the sample with pah emission , using pahfit .",
    "total fits are shown , as well as color - coded individual contributions of dust continuum , pah emission and molecular and atomic line emission .",
    "for each object we show their spectrum and the continuum - subtracted spectrum to highlight the pah contribution .",
    "we found that pahfit fits the spectra well from 5@xmath217@xmath1 m .",
    "pah emission is unequivocal in figure[pahfit ] . in terms of general appearance ,",
    "the continuum - subtracted spectra of objects like msxlmc464 , sage1cj050354.56@xmath2671848.9 , and iras05452@xmath26924 are reminiscent of the spectral components between 5 and 14@xmath1 m attributed to neutral pahs , pah clusters , and pah cations @xcite .    at longer wavelengths",
    ", we find that pahfit has some trouble fitting the red side of the 17-@xmath1 m pah complex that also includes h@xmath0 emission at 17.0@xmath1 m ( examples are iras04514@xmath26931 and irasf04532@xmath26709 in figure[pahfit ] ) .",
    "in particular at about 18@xmath1 m there seems to be more emission than can be produced by pahfit : there are no known pah emission features between 17.9 and 18.9@xmath1 m .",
    "it is also not due to spurious `` features '' related to diffuse gas in the lmc ( i.e. [ s iii ] at 18.7@xmath1 m , as mentioned by @xcite ) .",
    "the 17-@xmath1 m complex is not as well studied as other , shorter - wavelength pah features . even though identified with _",
    "iso_-sws , it was only _",
    "spitzer_-irs that allowed a more detailed analysis of this complex ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "it is described as a broad plateau that can extend from 16 to 19@xmath1 m , but observations show a varied substructure . @xcite and @xcite have used large molecule databases to show that a huge range of merged profile structures can be achieved by combining individual pah emission contributions . thus it is not surprising that the fits are not perfect in this region .",
    "none of this affects the continuum underlying the ice bands .",
    "we note that a detailed analysis of pah emission is beyond the scope of this paper , but we verified that pahfit is an adequate tool to use in the context of a yso study .",
    "while the spectral contributions underlying the co@xmath0 ice feature are well constrained , that is not the case for the 5@xmath27@xmath1 m ice complex . even using pahfit to account for emission features ,",
    "it is very difficult to isolate this ice band : the only objects for which this was possible have no detectable pah emission ( see below ) .",
    "the four remaining objects do not show obvious pah emission in their spectrum ; we thus adopt the traditional approach of fitting a low - order polynomial to the continuum .",
    "continuum points are selected to avoid the ice bands at 5@xmath27 and 15.2@xmath1 m and the silicate feature at 10@xmath1 m .",
    "the 18-@xmath1 m silicate feature and the water libration mode are very broad , and we do not try to extract them from the spectra ; instead we treat them as contributing to the local `` pseudo - continuum '' .",
    "figure[polyfit ] shows the continuum fits for these objects .",
    "the two objects at the top ( iras05246@xmath27137 and iras05328@xmath26827 ) show strong silicate in absorption and weak co@xmath0 ice absorption . sage1cj052546.49@xmath2661411.3 and iras05240@xmath26809 show silicate emission and self - absorption respectively , even though the nature of the silicates is difficult to constrain without a detailed study .",
    "in general the silicate optical depth is not well constrained as the shape of the continuum underlying it is somewhat uncertain .",
    "both these objects show ice absorption at 15.2 and 6@xmath1 m .",
    "iras05240@xmath26809 also shows h@xmath0 emission at 5.51 , 6.91 , and 9.66@xmath1 m .",
    "these two apparently pah - free objects are the only ysos for which we were able to successfully isolate the 5@xmath27@xmath1 m ice band .    for the 11 pah - rich ysos we use the pahfit output to extract the optical depth of the ice features , for the remaining objects we use the spectrum after subtracting a polynomial continuum .",
    "we compared the optical depth spectra obtained when using the pahfit and the polynomial continua , for these four objects .",
    "this allowed us to constrain how the choice of continuum affects the measured column densities for the ice features ( section4.3.3 )      it has been shown in laboratory experiments that the co@xmath0 ice profile at 15.2@xmath1 m is a sensitive probe of the environment in which the ice resides , both in terms of physical conditions like temperature ( it traces strong heating , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also in terms of molecular environment as is discussed in the next section .",
    "on one hand this makes co@xmath0 an interesting ice species to study , but on the other it implies that laboratory studies of this solid are very complex as the whole molecular system needs to be considered , not just co@xmath0 ice in isolation .",
    "realistic astrophysical environments are also impossible to replicate .",
    "thus we can not model the co@xmath0 profiles directly using experiments .",
    "the next best thing is a phenomenological approach that attempts to model the observed profiles as a combination of `` components '' that have been well studied in the laboratory .",
    "co@xmath0 does not form in any sizable abundance in the gas phase in the diffuse interstellar medium or molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is not yet fully understood which of a number of possible grain - surface reactions is responsible for the abundance and ubiquity of co@xmath0 ices .",
    "it was initially thought that this molecule would form during strong uv photolysis of mixed ices containing h@xmath0o and co , conditions easily found in the envelopes of luminous embedded ysos .",
    "however , observations of abundant co@xmath0 also in the quiescent ism @xcite indicate that _ additional _ radiative processing , besides that provided by cosmic - ray induced photons and ambient radiation field photons , is not required for co@xmath0 formation .",
    "h@xmath0o ice is the most abundant ice species , followed by co and co@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these distinct ice species are often observed in the same sightline and are present on the same grain mantles possibly in a layered , `` onion''-like structure . in particular ,",
    "two independent components have been identified on icy mantles : h@xmath0o - dominated and co - dominated components , also referred to as polar and apolar components , respectively @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario is that h@xmath0o ice ( with traces of co , nh@xmath11 , and ch@xmath32 ) forms easily and widely in molecular clouds , as it requires relatively low gas density and only moderately low temperature . at higher densities grains",
    "accrete mainly apolar molecules like co ( and ir inactive molecules like o@xmath0 and n@xmath0 , see below ) ; this rapid freezeout creates a mantle of almost pure co on top of a water - rich layer @xcite .",
    "laboratory experiments show that 15.2-@xmath1 m co@xmath0 profiles in ice matrices dominated by either h@xmath0o or co have very distinct properties .",
    "the comparison of laboratory and astronomical co@xmath0 ice profiles shows that the latter are well represented by a combination of polar ( h@xmath0o - dominated ) and apolar ( co - dominated ) components @xcite .",
    "the polar component usually dominates , accounting for a large fraction of the total co@xmath0 column density @xcite .",
    "thus , even though doubts remain about its formation mechanism , these observations indicate that viable co@xmath0 formation routes must be present both in h@xmath0o- and co - dominated ice mantles @xcite .    for some galactic ysos",
    ", the co@xmath0 ice profiles show additional substructure .",
    "the fact that this structure is absent in the co@xmath0 profiles in quiescent regions @xcite suggests that thermal processing could play a role in the production of this additional co@xmath0 component .",
    "@xcite showed that when heated the spectra of laboratory mixtures of h@xmath0o , ch@xmath11oh ( methanol ) , and co@xmath0 in equal parts develop a complex structure due to annealing and crystallization .",
    "the samples become very inhomogeneous and at temperatures of typically 100k ch@xmath11oh and co@xmath0 segregate and inclusions of pure co@xmath0 are produced . as a result the profiles develop the double - peaked structure that is characteristic of pure - co@xmath0 ice @xcite .",
    "a red shoulder at 15.3@xmath1 m also appears , very likely due to the interaction of co@xmath0 and ch@xmath11oh molecules .",
    "several studies have found that the annealed ice component combined with the dominant water - rich component fits the observed co@xmath0 ice profiles well @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that for the case of low - luminosity ysos , where the relatively high temperature needed for the segregation process may not be reached , the pure - co@xmath0 component arises from the distillation of the co : co@xmath0 component through evaporation of co at lower temperatures ( @xmath3350k ) .    bringing all this information together",
    ", we have the following schematic scenario @xcite .",
    "co@xmath0 is formed plentifully on icy grain surfaces in quiescent molecular clouds , mainly in an h@xmath0o - rich medium but with a contribution of a co - rich mantle in agreement with observations .",
    "this complex ice mantle is heated up by the contracting yso , and what happens next depends on the temperature profile of the dusty envelope . in the environments of massive luminous ysos ,",
    "high enough temperatures can be reached ( @xmath13100k in laboratory experiments , 50@xmath280k in collapsing dusty envelopes ) so that annealing and segregation give rise to co - existing h@xmath0o - rich and co@xmath0-rich ( @xmath13 equal parts h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 ) components @xcite .",
    "this heating process would sublimate the co - rich component . in the envelopes of lower luminosity ysos",
    ", only moderate heating takes place ( @xmath3450k ) ; the co gradually desorbs leaving behind a pure - co@xmath0 component @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "h@xmath0o - rich , co - rich and pure - co@xmath0 components co - exist in icy mantles . how these two scenarios are played out in a yso environment",
    "would depend on the luminosity and evolutionary stage of the object , and the temperature profile across the dusty envelope .",
    "recent studies have favored combining the water - rich component exclusively with either annealed ices @xcite or co- and/or co@xmath0-dominated ices @xcite to model the observed profiles .",
    "both approaches fit the data well , and it is not clear which of these is more appropriate . we avoid making a priori decisions on the nature of the profiles observed towards the lmc sources .",
    "we model the co@xmath0 ice profiles in our sample in both ways : _ i _ ) by combining h@xmath0o - rich , co - rich , and pure - co@xmath0 components ; and _ ii _ ) by combining a h@xmath0o - rich component with an annealed component  the same approach is used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the next sections describe the laboratory ice profiles used in the analysis and the resulting profile fits .",
    "the laboratory ice profiles used in this study come from public databases from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* leiden database : polar , apolar , and pure co@xmath0 ices ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* annealed ices ) , which table[lab ] lists . in the leiden database ,",
    "particle shape corrections are applied to the laboratory profiles using different grain models @xcite ; following other authors @xcite we use a continuous distribution of ellipsoids ( cde , each grain shape equally probable ) that seems to work best for co@xmath0 profiles . according to @xcite no such particle shape corrections are appropriate for the highly inhomogeneous annealed ices .",
    "these databases are incredibly rich , and many parameters can be tuned ( laboratory temperatures , fractions of ices in mixtures , etc ) . instead of using the full databases and just testing which combination of lab profiles fits each spectrum best ( as done in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we simplify the problem @xcite , and reduce whenever possible the number of free variables  i.e. temperatures are kept fixed except in the case of the processed ices where thermal effects are being probed , and relative concentrations are only changed when it affects the morphology of the profiles in a unique way .",
    "this should make possible trends easier to detect .",
    "the lower resolution of the _ spitzer _  ll mode ( when compared to previously published analysis ) also justifies this simplification , as profile details are lost ( see below ) . for the same reason we only adopt the three dominant components used in the analysis of @xcite ( h@xmath0o - rich , co - rich , and pure co@xmath0 ) . in the rest of this section",
    "we describe the profiles used .    for polar ( water - dominated ) ices , two mixtures are available in the databases : h@xmath0o : co@xmath0=100:14 at 10k and h@xmath0o : co@xmath0:co=100:20:3 at 20k . as it can be seen from figure[smooth_ices ]",
    "( top left ) these two mixtures produce very similar spectra , with only a minor shift in the peak position ; still we consider them both for completeness sake .",
    "a 4@xmath35-order polynomial is used to remove the contribution of the h@xmath0o libration mode at 13@xmath1 m from the spectra of all water - rich mixtures used .    for apolar mixtures of co and co@xmath0 several types of mixtures",
    "are available , either just co : co@xmath0 or including ir inactive molecules , co : o@xmath0:co@xmath0 and co : n@xmath0:co@xmath0 . ir inactive molecules like o@xmath0 and n@xmath0 are formed in the gas phase and accrete onto the cold grains at higher densities .",
    "they have no innate ir transitions , but in an ice matrix they interact with other molecules , subtly changing the shape of strong profiles @xcite . for the same co@xmath0:co concentration ratio , the presence of o@xmath0 in the ice matrix makes the co@xmath0 ice profile slightly wider ( figure[smooth_ices ] top right , top two pairs of spectra ) .",
    "however , the exact amount of o@xmath0 in the mixture is not well constrained ( profiles from spectra where the amount of o@xmath0 is 10 , 20 or 50% of co are indistinguishable ) .",
    "therefore we keep the o@xmath0 concentration at 50% of that of co. the presence of n@xmath0 does not change the profiles in a noticeable way ( n@xmath0 is a ",
    "silent  matrix component , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so we do not include those laboratory profiles .    with increasing co@xmath0 fraction in the ice mixtures ,",
    "the co@xmath0 profiles become progressively more asymmetric , with a more pronounced blue wing and also blue - shifting the peak position ( figure[smooth_ices ] top right , bottom two pairs of spectra ) .",
    "these changes in the profile shape are monotonic with co@xmath0:co ratio ; thus we can interpolate between available laboratory spectra and ratios ( see * ? ? ?",
    "available spectra have co@xmath0:co ratios as listed in table[lab ] .",
    "the temperature of the mixture ( generally 10 , 20 and 30k ) also has no unique effect on the shape of the profile for any of the mixtures mentioned so far ; we adopt the profiles for 10k .",
    "laboratory spectra of pure - co@xmath0 ices are available at three temperatures ( 10 , 50 , and 80k ) ; with increasing temperature the profile becomes narrower , and the component at 15.25@xmath1 m becomes more pronounced ( figure[smooth_ices ] bottom left ) .",
    "we use the laboratory spectra for the h@xmath0o : ch@xmath11oh : co@xmath0@xmath131:1:1 mixture from @xcite as representative of the annealed ice component . at lower temperature",
    "those profiles are rather broad and structureless ; as the samples are gradually heated the characteristic peak splitting becomes pronounced ( @xmath3100k ) , and the profile becomes considerably narrower ( figure[smooth_ices ] bottom right ) .",
    "profiles are available at temperatures from 5 to 135k in 5-k steps ( table[lab ] ) .",
    "we should point out that laboratory temperatures quoted throughout this paper correspond to lower temperatures in conditions typical of dense molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "a crucial thing to realize is that previous studies made use of spectra with higher spectral resolving power .",
    "observations performed with the _ iso_-sws ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the _ spitzer _  irs sh mode have @xmath36@xmath131000 and @xmath36@xmath13600 , respectively ; for the irs ll mode at 15.2@xmath1 m @xmath36@xmath37 . we take this into account by convolving the laboratory ice profiles described previously with a gaussian profile at each wavelength element with a width appropriate to simulate the lower resolution of the ll mode ; figure[smooth_ices ] shows the effect of the resolution on the profiles .",
    "the convolved profiles for pure co@xmath0 and annealed ices at higher temperature ( lower two panels ) show that the substructure in the profile that is normally associated with thermal processing is smoothed out at the ll resolution .",
    "the double - peaked structure is _ no longer clearly visible_. thus we are not able to diagnose processing in our spectra as readily and to the same level of detail as in previous studies .",
    "figure[smooth_ices ] also shows which particular components contribute to specific parts of the profile . for illustration purposes ,",
    "we divide the profile into a blue and a red wing ( respectively short- and long - wards of 15.2@xmath1 m ) .",
    "the h@xmath0o - rich and annealed mixtures at low temperature contribute to both wings of the profile and the red wing is much more extended than the blue wing ( @xmath13 1.1 versus 0.45@xmath1 m ) .",
    "the co - rich , pure - co@xmath0 , and annealed mixtures at high temperature contribute almost exclusively to the blue wing of the profile  the pure co@xmath0 profiles extend the furthest into the blue .",
    "the irs spectra in our sample were compared to the laboratory profiles using a @xmath24 minimization technique ( levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimization , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making use of the idl  routines developed by ( * ? ? ?",

    "this section discusses the resulting fits .",
    "each observed co@xmath0 profile is modelled in two ways as described previously .",
    "figure[ice_fits ] shows the resulting fitted profiles .",
    "table[fit_data ] lists relevant fitted parameters as well as the total co@xmath0 column density ( see next section ) and the percentages ( in terms of column density ) for each component . for three ysos ( msxlmc464 , iras05246 - 7137 , and sage1cj054059.29@xmath2704402.6 ) the optical depth spectra were not deemed of good enough quality to fit meaningful models .",

    "there is a [ neiii ] emission line at 15.56@xmath1 m and a weak pah feature at 15.9@xmath1 m .",
    "therefore it is possible that these features are artifacts related to these two emission lines , either from the object itself or from its sky background .",
    "the fitted profiles show that we are not able to distinguish between the different h@xmath0o- and co - rich mixtures used : similarly good fits are possible if the h@xmath0o : co@xmath0 component is replaced by the h@xmath0o : co@xmath0:co mixture or the co : co@xmath0 is replaced by co : o@xmath0:co@xmath0 .",
    "there is also only a negligible difference in the fits when using the three available temperatures for pure - co@xmath0 ice .",
    "accordingly , we make no such distinctions in table[fit_data ] , referring only to h@xmath0o - rich ( polar ) , co - rich ( `` apolar1 '' ) and pure - co@xmath0 ( `` apolar2 '' ) components .",

    "the polar+apolar modeling fits their spectra better while for three other objects the polar+annealed combination performs better .",
    "@xcite found that the combination of polar+annealed components fitted the data of their galactic sample better , and suggested that this indicated that ice processing has occurred .",
    "we believe that for our data we can not make this particular discrimination .",
    "the laboratory components are obviously very different , but the loss of spectral detail at the ll resolution and the combination of multiple components limits what we can discriminate .    in most cases , the two methods agree well on the amount of water - rich ice required .",
    "the majority of ysos have a large fraction of co@xmath0 locked into h@xmath0o - rich ice : for eight of the twelve fitted objects the polar component accounts for @xmath1345@xmath275% in column density .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the other four objects either no water - rich ice is required or the two strategies do not agree on how much is necessary .",
    "the polar component provides the dominant contribution to the red wing of the co@xmath0 profile ( figure[smooth_ices ] ) .",

    "the lmc sample is restricted to very luminous ysos , and it should , in terms of luminosity at least , be comparable to the sample of luminous galactic ysos observed with _",
    "spitzer _  studies of star formation concentrated on nearby star - forming regions , molecular clouds and isolated globules that form predominantly intermediate- and low - luminosity objects .",
    "these low - luminosity galactic samples include a variety of evolutionary stages from more embedded ysos to herbig aebe , t tauri and zero - age main - sequence stars .",
    "the different _ timescales _ involved in the formation of objects with different luminosity may leave an imprint on the observed ice chemistry .",
    "furthermore , ysos in the lmc should in general appear more evolved due to the smaller dust column density in lmc objects when compared to galactic objects .",
    "galactic and lmc measurements sample different _ spatial scales _ ( section2 ) , from a few parsecs in the lmc to milliparsecs in the galaxy .",
    "if there is a gradient of ice abundances between the more immediate yso cocoon and the wider molecular environment in which it is immersed @xcite , then the fact that ice properties are integrated over different spatial scales could affect global abundance ratios .",
    "such issues should be considered , since models of molecular clouds and their chemical evolution during the star formation process suggest that both temporal and radial variations of molecular concentrations are important ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite singles out co abundances ( and the balance of its gas and solid phases ) as particularly critical in determining the chemistry of star - forming cores .",
    "even though they did not explicitly discuss co@xmath0 formation , the evolution of the two molecules is obviously closely linked .",
    "the balance of water in the gas phase and in ice form is also controlled by time- and space - dependent effects @xcite .",
    "the focus of this project is how the metal - poor star - formation environment in the lmc influences the chemistry of the envelopes that surround ysos .",
    "thus we now look at what is known about the environment in molecular clouds in the lmc .",
    "the structure of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in metal - poor galaxies including the lmc is different from that in the galaxy .",
    "observations suggest that in metal - poor galaxies there are large reservoirs of h@xmath0 that are not traced by co ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the magnitude of this h@xmath0-to - co excess was found to depend strongly on both metallicity and strength of the radiation field .",
    "this has been interpreted as the result of selective photodissociation of co in the outer parts of metal - poor gmcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : h@xmath0 readily self - shields while co is shielded from the photodissociating radiation mostly by dust , which is less abundant at low metallicities .",
    "in this case , co emission would trace only the inner parts of metal - poor gmcs .",
    "if co cores are smaller in the lmc , due to the harsher uv radiation field and lower dust abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then we could naively expect co@xmath0 production to be reduced",
    ". a lower production rate of co@xmath0 could just result from the lower abundance of gas - phase co observed in the lmc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it could also result from a smaller density of dust grains that act as seeds for the surface chemistry .",
    "both effects would then tend to reduce the value of @xmath43 .",
    "however as described above this is not what we observed in the lmc .",
    "the formation of co@xmath0 ice in a wide variety of environments ( e.g. , both quiescent sightlines and low- and high - luminosity ysos ) argues against the need for enhanced radiative processing .",
    "still , laboratory experiments do show that uv irradiation enhances co@xmath0 production ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and models of diffusive surface chemistry can produce high co@xmath0 densities at slightly elevated temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lmc has a stronger ambient uv radiation field when compared to the galaxy . as a result of the stronger radiation field ,",
    "the average ism dust temperature is also generally higher in the lmc ( 12@xmath34@xmath48@xmath3435k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than in the galaxy ( 19@xmath34@xmath48@xmath3425k , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  dust temperatures in cloud cores are lower than in the diffuse ism .",
    "both these effects could increase co@xmath0 production and increase @xmath43 , consistent with what is observed .",
    "we should also consider the possibility that the formation of water ice is somewhat inhibited in the lmc .",
    "the largest column density of water ice measured so far in the lmc is @xmath135@xmath1810@xmath49@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this is below the highest column densities measured towards galactic ysos , 10@xmath230@xmath1810@xmath49@xmath40 @xcite . due to the small number of lmc objects investigated to date and possible selection effects",
    "this may not be a significant difference .",
    "water ice seems to form rather easily in molecular clouds .",
    "however the a@xmath50-threshold for water ice formation ( @xmath51@xmath133mag for typical galactic molecular clouds ) is affected by the strength of the incident radiation field and dust temperature @xcite .",
    "still , it is difficult to see how water ice formation could be inhibited when co@xmath0 ice formation is not .",
    "we analyzed _ spitzer_-irs spectra of a sample of embedded young stellar objects in the lmc , obtained as part of the sage - spec  legacy program .",
    "we selected sources for this analysis based on the shape of their mid - ir continuum and the presence of the bending mode of co@xmath0 ice at 15.2@xmath1 m ; a total of 15 sources were included , with three co@xmath0 ice detections considered marginal only ( @xmath333-@xmath46 ) .",
    "based on modelling of the objects seds , we characterize the lmc ysos as luminous and still in the early embedded stages of evolution .",
    "a large fraction of the spectra of the lmc ysos show prominent pah emission .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the sources are more evolved , ultracompact hii regions .",
    "the _ spitzer_-irs spatial resolution combined with the distance to the lmc implies that our spectra sample a relatively large fraction of the ysos environment ( a few square parsecs ) when compared to galactic ysos , and thus pah emission frequently appears superimposed onto the spectra of embedded ysos . this makes the identification of the 5@xmath27@xmath1 m ice band difficult .",
    "we detect water ice at 6@xmath1 m for two ysos and the 6.8-@xmath1 m feature ( likely due to ammonium ) in a single object .",
    "it is usually believed that co@xmath0 forms on icy mantles , in water - dominated ( polar ) and/or co - dominated ( apolar ) ice matrices . in galactic ysos , the water - rich component is the most abundant .",
    "these components exhibit a distinct morphology allowing a multi - component analysis of the observed profiles .",
    "the double - peaked structure found in the co@xmath0 ice profiles towards ysos in the galaxy is a signature of thermal processing , via which the co@xmath0 segregates from the other ice constituents .",
    "there are two types of modelling usually found in the literature : a dominant water - rich component is combined with either one or more apolar ( co- or co@xmath0-dominated ) components , or with an annealed ice component ( water , co@xmath0 and methanol in equal parts ) .",
    "accordingly , we model the observed profiles of co@xmath0 ice towards lmc ysos in these two ways , using databases of laboratory ice profiles available in the literature . we find that at the lower - resolution of the irs ll mode , a considerable amount of detail is lost from the laboratory spectra .",
    "thus our comparison of the two types of modelling is not conclusive .",
    "we find that the co@xmath0 ice towards lmc ysos is also dominated by the water - rich component , and they also require a contribution from pure co@xmath0 ice .",
    "thus in terms of general morphology and composition the co@xmath0 ice towards lmc ysos is similar to that observed towards galactic ysos .",
    "there are however two possible differences .",
    "first , there is a hint that the fraction of co@xmath0 ice locked into a water - rich matrix is smaller in the lmc .",
    "furthermore , the column density ratio @xmath43 , available for some of the targets , seems larger in the lmc .",
    "one puzzling fact becomes noticeable when the available galactic samples are separated into luminous and low - luminosity ysos .",
    "the ysos in our lmc sample are luminous and thus should in principle be compared to the galactic high - luminosity sample .",
    "however , it is apparent from figures [ water_rich ] and [ ratio ] that the properties of the co@xmath0 profiles observed towards lmc ysos more resemble those of _ low - luminosity galactic ysos _ rather than those of the high - luminosity galactic ysos , both in terms of water - rich fraction and concentration ratio .",
    "admittedly the size of the lmc sample is small thus these results are tentative for now .",
    "we discuss how the temporal and spatial evolution of the physical conditions in molecular clouds can affect the observed properties of the different samples we compare .",
    "we also discuss the implications of our results in terms of the star formation conditions in molecular clouds in the lmc .",
    "the ism of the lmc has lower metallicity than the galactic ism ( @xmath4z@xmath5 ) .",
    "this affects the conditions in molecular clouds in the lmc in two parallel ways . on one hand",
    "there is less carbon and oxygen , and less dust . on the other hand ,",
    "due to reduced shielding , the physical conditions in molecular clouds are harsher .",
    "co in the gas phase is less abundant , and the gas : dust ratio is larger by a factor 2 to 3 in the lmc than in the galaxy .",
    "observations also suggest that co cores are smaller in the lmc , the result of selective photodissociation of co in the outer parts of gmcs .",
    "if water ice abundance is unchanged , these effects would conspire to reduce the ratio of co@xmath0 ice to water ice in the lmc .",
    "this is clearly not what we observe .",
    "on the other hand , the twined facts that the uv radiation field is stronger and the average dust temperature is higher in the lmc could increase co@xmath0 production , which would be consistent with what we see in our sample .",
    "our results are tantalizing but not yet conclusive .",
    "we suggest that dust temperature could be responsible for observed differences between the lmc and the galaxy .",
    "co ice is more volatile than co@xmath0 and the co profiles can be used as an indicator of thermal processing if different components correspond to environments of different volatility .",
    "the suggestion is that co ice is more sensitive to the relatively small dust temperature differences mentioned previously .",
    "furthermore , the possible increases in uv photolysis and thermal processing are related to metallicity .",
    "we have obtained _",
    "spitzer_-irs observations in the smc and complementary ground - based data in both lmc and smc , with the goal to incorporate co ice profiles in our analysis , and to extend these studies to the even more metal - poor environment of the smc .",
