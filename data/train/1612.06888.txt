    "one of the most profound predictions of the theory is that as the driving force increases , the transfer rate reaches a maximum and further increases in the driving force lead to lower reaction rates , termed the inverted regime .",

    "this approach incorporates a fully quantum - mechanical treatment of both the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom and recovers the well - known marcus expression in the semiclassical limit . the model is parameterized by the vibrational normal mode frequencies , and the electronic energies and energy derivatives at a reference configuration .",
    "the approach has been used by our group to compute state - to - state transition rates in semi - empirical models for organic semiconducting light - emitting diode and photovoltaics @xcite .",
    "we recently made a significant breakthrough in using this approach by tying it it to a fully _ ab initio _ quantum chemical approach for determining the diabatic states and electron / phonon coupling terms allowing unprecedented accuracy and utility for computing state - to - state electronic transition rates .",

    "it is useful to connect the various terms in the phonon - dressed hamiltonian with specific physical parameters .",
    "first , the reorganization energy is given by @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are the huang - rhys factors for each phonon mode .",
    "these are related to the franck - condon factor describing the overlap between the @xmath25 vibronic state in one electronic state with the @xmath26 vibronic state in the other .",

    "we next discuss how we have used the edmiston - ruedenberg ( er ) localization scheme @xcite to estimate the couplings .",
    "we also present how one can construct a reduced set of harmonic modes that fully capture the electron / nuclear coupling .",
    "a workaround is to transform to a diabatic representation , whereby the hamiltonian is written as @xmath41 fig .",
    "[ adiadiab ] shows a sketch of the adiabatic and diabatic potentials for a model two level system . while the adiabatic representation is precisely defined in terms of electronic eigenstates , the diabatic representation offers several advantages",

    "second , potential energy surfaces are smoother and the avoided crossing is eliminated . a number of diabatization approaches have been developed and the reader is referred to ref .   for a general review .",
    "the problem now is how to obtain the transformation matrix @xmath43 while a number of methods are available a straightforward approach is to eliminate derivative coupling mathematically by requireing @xmath44 however , this is computationally very expensive  especially for",
    "complex molecular systems , and exact solutions generally do not exist .",
    "@xcite    an alternative approach is to use physical intuition rather than a purely mathematical constraint to define the diabatic states .",

    "the linear assumption is reasonable so long as the mixing angle is small .",
    "@xcite    we obtain the diabatic couplings @xmath49 and the mixing angle @xmath50 via er localization and transform the electronic hamiltonian from the adiabatic basis to the diabatic basis _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath51 the diabatic coupling is then given by @xmath52    we then diagonalize the electronic part and transform the electron / nuclear coupling back into the adiabatic basis . in doing so",

    "[ ham1 ] @xmath53    alternatively , one can use the generalized mulliken - hush model ( gmh ) @xcite which works well for linear systems but does not generalize easily to systems with more than two charge centres .",

    "er localization can be seen as a extension of gmh which overcomes some drawbacks of gmh @xcite .",
    "both er and gmh require convergence of the initial and final reference states and have be used to compute the coupling terms required for the tclme approach given above.@xcite      while the marcus expression is elegant in its simplicity in requiring three parameters that can be obtained experimentally , it masks a wealth of detail that underlie the quantum transition .",
    "considerable insight into the state - to - state dynamics can be revealed by examining the nuclear motions driving and coupling the electronic states .",
    "our approach is based on earlier work by our group @xcite and burghardt _ et al .",
    "central to the theory is that there exists a collective nuclear displacement coordinate that connects the initial geometry of the donor to the final geometry of the acceptor .",
    "however , until this work a general systematic approach for determining such motions did not exist .    generally speaking",
    ", this collective coordinate involves all nuclear degrees of freedom .",

    "[ ham1 ] suggests that there exists a subset of motions that are specific modes that capture the majority of the electronic / nuclear coupling and give a dominant contribution to the collective reaction coordinate . within the linearized approximation for the electronic / nuclear coupling , we can write a force tensor @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the electronic / nuclear coupling term in eq .",

    "both @xmath72 and @xmath73 are @xmath68 matrices . however , for a two - state system , the former will have exactly @xmath74 non - trivial eigenvalues , @xmath75 , with corresponding eigenvectors , @xmath76 , whereas the latter will have exactly @xmath77 non - trivial eigenvalues , @xmath78 , and corresponding eigenvectors , @xmath79 .",

    "in addition , we can gain a computational advantage since presumably this reduced set of modes give the dominant contribution to the electron - phonon coupling and autocorrelation function given as the kernel in eq .",

    "it is crucial to notice that the vectors given in eq .",
    "[ eq : locaiham ] are _ not linearly independent_. consequently , special care must be taken to generate the reduced sub - space . to facilitate this",

    "we thus obtain a new vector @xmath102 which is then reintroduced into the iteration scheme .    for the first iteration , @xmath103 is parallel to the bare electron - phonon coupling vector @xmath104 and the associated frequency is @xmath105 .",

    "for all three molecules , two pess intersect where c@xmath113c bond is slightly longer than the equilibrium length .",
    "when c@xmath113c bond gets excited , it elongates and helps molecules to pass the intersection .",

    "<S> our approach concentrates the coupling between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom into a small number of reduced harmonic modes that can be written as linear combinations of the vibrational normal modes of the molecular system about a given electronic minima . using a time - convolutionless master - equation approach , parameterized by accurate quantum - chemical methods , we benchmark the approach against experimental results and predictions from marcus theory for triplet energy transfer for a series of donor - bridge - acceptor systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that using only a single reduced mode  termed the `` primary '' mode , one obtains an accurate evaluation of the golden - rule rate constant and insight into the nuclear motions responsible for coupling the initial and final electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the utility of the approach by computing the inelastic electronic transition rates in a model donor - bridge - acceptor complex that has been experimentally shown that its exciton transfer pathway can be radically modified by mode - specific infrared excitation of its vibrational mode . </S>"
