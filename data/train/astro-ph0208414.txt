    "nearly half of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the inner part of the milky way is estimated to be in the molecular component ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with the largest portion of the molecular ism in giant molecular clouds or cloud complexes ( gmcs ) of masses @xmath8 @xcite , where most of star formation occurs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gmcs are generally turbulent , self - gravitating , and magnetized ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in external galaxies , they often appear in clusters , forming giant molecular associations ( gmas ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or within the boundaries of superclouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these giant clouds in spiral galaxies are mostly associated with spiral arms , but they sometimes appear in the interarm regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by regulating the rate and mode of star formation in disk galaxies , gmcs play a fundamental role in controlling galactic evolution and may be a key to understanding the nature of the hubble sequence . but how gmcs form is still not clearly understood .    traditionally ,",
    "proposed mechanisms for giant cloud formation fall into two categories : stochastic coagulation of smaller clouds ( following @xcite ; e.g. , @xcite ) or collective effects involving instabilities ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "existing work suggests that collisional agglomeration may proceed too slowly ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "collisions in most cases result in disruption rather than merger ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; the available mass in smaller clouds is not enough to form gmcs through collisional build - up @xcite ; collisional agglomeration would lead to magnetically supercritical clouds and active star formation before gmc - scale masses are reached @xcite ; gmc chemistry may be inconsistent with an extended build - up phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all of these and other difficulties point to the need for collective effects @xcite .",
    "this second means of building gmcs and gmas involves large - scale dynamical instabilities that coherently amass material over scales large compared to the sizes of diffuse atomic clouds ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the small - scale structure of the medium plays a secondary role , with the modal gathering of material operating collectively on the whole distribution .",
    "coherently - growing unstable modes that produce condensations depend on various effects , including self - gravity , the coriolis force , sheared azimuthal motion , magnetic tension , and magnetic buoyancy , all of which have been shown to interact in unstable fashion .",
    "the two most well - known condensation instabilities are the parker instability @xcite , in which buoyancy causes dominantly in - plane magnetic fields to buckle , with matter collecting in valleys ; and the swing amplifier , in which epicyclic motion conspires with galactic shear to enable self - gravitating enhancement of overdense regions @xcite .",
    "another condensation instability that has been shown to be efficient in low - shear , magnetized regions is the magneto - jeans instability ( mji ) , in which magnetic tension of in - plane fields counters the stabilizing effect of the coriolis force , allowing self - gravitating contraction of overdense regions @xcite .",
    "because the growth rates of parker and mji modes increase with magnetic field strength and density , the compression of the ism induced by passage through stellar spiral arms may be important in triggering gmc and gma formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . observed distributions of regions and ob star complexes in a `` beads on a string '' pattern along spiral arms",
    "may be the direct consequence of cooperation among the parker instability , jeans instability , and spiral arm potentials ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we presented studies of detailed nonlinear evolution of self - gravitating modes in shearing , razor - thin galactic disks .",
    "we showed that formation of bound condensations via the swing instability is subject to `` threshold '' behavior , with models having sufficiently small values of the toomre @xmath4 parameter ( see eq .",
    "[ [ toomre_q ] ] below ) producing bound clouds , and models with larger values of @xmath4 remaining nonlinearly stable .",
    "we found that the threshold value of @xmath4 is in the range @xmath9 ( for magnetic field strengths from zero up to thermal - equipartition values ) , consistent with an apparent mean threshold @xmath10 for star formation evident from observational studies @xcite . in paper",
    "i , we also elucidated the role of mji in forming bound condensations by showing that in low - shear regions where the swing amplifier can not operate , the mechanism that leads to growth of perturbations is quite different from that in high - shear regions , and that the presence of magnetic fields is crucial to the instability . in the absence of magnetic fields ,",
    "specific vorticity is conserved ; contraction of vorticity - conserving masses leads to increased coriolis forces that exceed the increase in self - gravity such that further contraction is prevented ( in the absence of a shearing background ) . in magnetized systems , however , tension forces can transfer vorticity from one region to another , such that condensation driven by self - gravity can proceed .",
    "effects of spiral arm gravity on the growth of giant clouds were explicitly addressed by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper ii ) using two - dimensional models .",
    "paper ii showed that for a spiral arm inside corotation , the enhanced surface density and shear gradients in the arm region promote the growth of gaseous spurs .",
    "these spurs jut nearly perpendicularly from the outer ( downstream ) side of the arm , and trail in the same sense as the arm itself ; this is consistent with observed spur - like dust lanes in m51 @xcite .",
    "we argued that the formation of spurs can be understood as a natural consequence of the mji within spiral arms , where compression leads to a reduced ( or negative ) shear gradient that allows these self - gravitating modes to grow over an extended time .",
    "paper ii showed that bound clouds of typical mass @xmath11 can form from spur fragmentation ; such condensations potentially represent structures that would initially be observed as gmas , and subsequently evolve to become bright ob associations .    because of their restriction to razor - thin geometry",
    ", our previous two - dimensional models could not capture the potential consequences of the parker instability on cloud formation .",
    "while previous work on the parker instability has studied the weak - shear limit ( see linear - theory analysis of @xcite , @xcite ) and the case of solid - body rotation ( see linear theory of @xcite and simulations by @xcite and @xcite ) , and indeed shown that rotation and shear tend to be stabilizing , no previous study focused primarily on parker modes has incorporated shear at a realistic `` average '' galactic level . although the parker instability has been proposed to prompt the formation of molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , existing numerical simulations",
    "indicate that the parker instability alone is unable to produce structures of high enough surface density to represent gmcs @xcite .    to study the coupling of the parker instability with self - gravitating modes",
    ", @xcite performed linear stability analyses for combined parker - jeans modes and concluded that clouds of mass @xmath12 form in the density regime for which self - gravity significantly modifies the parker instability ; this regime of densities is expected to be found in spiral arm regions only . @xcite",
    "included solid - body rotation in a linear - theory analysis of the parker - jeans instability , and concluded that the transfer of angular momentum out of growing condensations may be a limiting factor .",
    "this transfer of angular momentum may be accomplished by magnetic stresses much as it occurs in the two - dimensional mji . a nonlinear simulation of the parker - jeans instability in a disk with solid - body rotation was among the models performed by @xcite , who found that filamentary structures tend to form perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "to our knowledge , there have previously been neither linear - theory nor numerical studies that incorporate all of the aforementioned elements that can contribute to three - dimensional instabilities in galactic disks : buoyant ( horizontal ) magnetic fields , self - gravity , rotation , and _ shear_. in this paper , we investigate nonlinear evolution of galactic disks allowing for all these fundamental physical agents .",
    "this work extends our previous studies ( paper i ) of structure formation via gravitational instability by including the effects of the parker instability .",
    "our primary objectives are to study how the parker instability develops in the presence of strong shear , and to compare the eventual evolution of disks under the various instabilities separately or in combination .",
    "we can thus assess the potential for gravitationally - bound cloud formation from a variety of dynamical mechanisms .",
    "since vertically - integrated , razor - thin disks are known to overestimate self - gravity at the midplane ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we will also study analytically and numerically how the stability of three - dimensional disks to in - plane self - gravitating modes changes as their thickness varies .    in our model",
    ", disks are local ( see  2.1 ) , isothermal in both space and time , and vertically stratified .",
    "initial magnetic fields are plane - parallel , pointing in the azimuthal direction . to model realistic conditions in disk galaxies , we include both external gravity arising from stars ( as a time - independent potential ) and gaseous self - gravity , which together counterbalance thermal and magnetic pressure gradients in an unperturbed state .",
    "we do not , however , consider in this paper other features such as stellar spiral arms and effects of cosmic rays that may enhance the magnetic buoyancy force .",
    "we begin by solving the governing equations to obtain initial static equilibrium density distributions , and then explore their gravitational stability to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we next select several parameter sets that represent `` average disk '' or `` spiral arm '' regions . after applying small - amplitude perturbations to the corresponding density profiles , we follow the nonlinear dynamical development with three - dimensional direct numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , we describe the basic mhd equations in the local `` shearing - sheet '' approximation , the computational methods we use , and our model parameters . in  3 , we present initial magnetohydrostatic equilibria in the presence of both self - gravity and external gravity , and analytically examine their axisymmetric stability by making simplifying assumptions . in  4 , we present the results of three - dimensional simulations for the parker instability without self - gravity (  4.1 ) , generalized ( parker / swing ) gravitational instability in shearing regions (  4.2 ) , and mji in nonshearing regions (  4.3 ) .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the implications of present work for galactic cloud formation in  5 .",
    "in this paper , we study nonlinear evolution of vertically stratified , differentially rotating , self - gravitating galactic gas disks with threaded magnetic fields in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we solve fully three - dimensional , compressible , ideal mhd equations in a local cartesian reference frame whose center lies at a galactocentric radius @xmath13 and orbits the galaxy with a fixed angular velocity @xmath14 . in this local frame , radial , azimuthal , and vertical coordinates are represented by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , respectively , and terms associated with the curvature effect are neglected @xcite .",
    "the local - frame equilibrium background velocity relative to the center of the box at @xmath18 is then reduced to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the local dimensionless shear rate . in terms of @xmath21 ,",
    "the local epicyclic frequency @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting `` shearing - sheet '' equations expanded in the local frame are @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( cf , @xcite ) . here , @xmath29 is the velocity in the local frame , @xmath30 is the mass density , @xmath31 is the thermal pressure , @xmath32 is the magnetic field , @xmath33 is the self - gravitational potential , @xmath34 is the external gravitational acceleration , @xmath35 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath36 is the isothermal sound speed . in equation ( [ mome ] ) , the third and fourth terms on the right hand side represent the tidal and coriolis forces , respectively , which balance each other in the initial equilibrium with @xmath37 .",
    "as expressed by equation ( [ eos ] ) , for simplicity we adopt an isothermal equation of state for all the simulations presented in this paper .",
    "an initial vertical equilibrium is defined by the balance between the total ( thermal plus magnetic ) pressure gradient and the total ( self plus external ) gravitational force . for @xmath34 representing the external gravity from stars , we adopt the simple form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the scale height of stars and @xmath40 is a free parameter .",
    "since most of gas is distributed within @xmath41 and the small-@xmath42 part of the realistic gravity deduced from stellar tracer populations can be described by a linear function of height ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath34 given in equation ( [ extg ] ) is a fairly good approximation in studying dynamics of the gaseous component .",
    "although a linear gravity law is known to strengthen the parker instability slightly compared to the case with a more realistic gravity law , the growth rate of the most unstable mode differs by only a factor of 1.2 @xcite . as we shall show in",
    " 3 , the total gravity that drives the parker instability in our models is similar to the external gravity adopted by other authors @xcite .    the numerical solutions to the dynamical equations ( [ cont])@xmath43([extg ] )",
    "are obtained using a modified version of the zeus code originally developed by @xcite .",
    "zeus is a time - explicit , operator - split , finite - difference method for solving the mhd equations on a staggered mesh , and has been demonstrated to provide robust solutions to a wide variety of astrophysical problems .",
    "zeus employs `` constrained transport '' to guarantee that @xmath44 within machine precision , and the `` method of characteristics '' for accurate propagation of alfvnic disturbances @xcite . for less diffusive advection of hydrodynamic variables , we apply a velocity decomposition method which treats the contribution from the background shearing parts as source terms , while solving the transport step using only the perturbed parts . in order to minimize the errors arising from discontinuities in the flow characteristics across the @xmath45-boundaries",
    ", the ghost zones adjoining the @xmath45-boundaries are kept active ( paper i ) . in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 directions ,",
    "we implement shearing box boundary conditions in which the @xmath45-boundaries are shearing - periodic and the @xmath48-boundaries are perfectly periodic @xcite . in the @xmath49 direction , we adopt free ( outflow ) boundary conditions which set all the variables in the boundary zones equal to the corresponding values in the adjacent active zones @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions permit outgoing waves and thus physical quantities such as mass , momentum , and magnetic flux can flow out of the simulation domain . since density is very low near the vertical boundaries , however , simulation results generally show that the total mass is conserved within 1% .    for computation of the self - gravitational potential",
    ", we employ a hybrid technique that combines the green function method to compute the gravitational kernels @xcite and the fourier transform method in shearing - sheet coordinates @xcite .",
    "our high - resolution models have a @xmath50 grid for ( @xmath45 , @xmath48 , @xmath17 ) ; we find that the poisson solver typically takes about 48% of the total cpu time .",
    "we have checked our implementation of the zeus code on various test problems including two - dimensional gravitational instability and propagation of gravito - mhd waves in three dimensions .",
    "our model disks are highly - idealized , smoothed versions of what is physically a much more complex , multiphase interstellar medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt an isothermal condition in both space and time , with an effective isothermal speed of sound @xmath51 , corresponding to a mean galactic thermal pressure @xmath52 @xcite and mean midplane density @xmath53 @xcite ; external galaxies have similar gaseous velocity dispersions .",
    "one of the parameters in our simulations is the rotation rate @xmath54 .",
    "when reporting dimensional results , we normalize to the solar neighborhood value @xmath55 @xcite . for a flat rotation curve , @xmath56 and thus @xmath57 ; we allow for varying @xmath21 to represent both `` average '' regions and reduced - shear ( spiral arm ) regions .",
    "our initial disk models are vertically stratified , with initial density distribution @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding surface density is given by @xmath59 .",
    "to characterize @xmath60 in a dimensionless fashion , we use the toomre @xmath4 stability parameter @xmath61 for an infinitesimally - thin disk , the critical value for axisymmetric gravitational stability is @xmath62 ( @xcite ; see also e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we shall show in  3 that the finite thickness of disks reduces @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for local gas surface density of @xmath64 comparable to the solar neighborhood ( cf , paper i ; @xcite ) , @xmath65",
    "; we adopt this value of @xmath4 for our `` average disk '' fiducial value .",
    "the initial magnetic field in our models points in the azimuthal ( @xmath66 ) direction and varies with height as @xmath67 ; its magnitude is parameterized by @xmath68 where the alfvn speed is @xmath69 . as an initial condition ,",
    "we fix @xmath70 spatially for all the mhd models in this paper , so that initially the alfvn speed is the same as the isothermal sound speed everywhere .",
    "this implies @xmath71 .",
    "we explore the nonlinear evolution of disks under both average disk and other galactic conditions by changing @xmath60 and @xmath21 . in order",
    "to model a portion of a gas disk inside a spiral arm , we use @xmath72 , which is five times larger than the average disk value .",
    "since @xmath73 and @xmath74 for isothermal gas from the constraint of potential vorticity conservation ( @xcite ; paper ii ) , this higher surface density corresponds to @xmath75 , which we adopt as a fiducial `` spiral arm '' value .",
    "we allow the shear parameter @xmath21 to vary from model to model , but fix it spatially in a given model .",
    "note that this arbitrary implementation of background shear is not consistent with realistic shear that varies rapidly across the spiral arm ( paper ii ) . nevertheless , our high surface density models allow us to focus on the effects of enhanced self - gravity inside the spiral arm without the additional complications of in - plane variations of the background .",

    "since @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath87 is suitable for `` average disk '' conditions , while @xmath88 would describe a spiral arm region ( taking the stellar spiral perturbation as weak ) .",

    "this size corresponds to the most unstable wavelength of the axisymmetric gravitational instability in each model with @xmath70 ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "conversion of @xmath2 into a physical value requires solving equations governing magnetohydrostatic equilibria , which will be presented in the next section . using @xmath95 and borrowing the results from figure [ h_s0 ]",

    "the former value for an unmagnetized model is consistent with the usual inner - galaxy scale height of @xmath100130 - 170 pc derived from the hydrostatic force balance between external gravity and turbulent pressure in the average disk condition ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter value for a @xmath70 model is similar to the direct estimate @xmath100220 pc for the scale height obtained by tangent point observations near the solar circle @xcite , beyond which the disk is known to flare dramatically @xcite .",
    "the larger initial scale height of magnetized models reflect the potential importance of magnetic pressure in supporting a galactic disk against gravity .",
    "if magnetic support is significant but is neglected in observationally - based determinations of the scale height from surface density and velocity dispersion , then @xmath2 could be underestimated .",
    "we note , however , that the dynamical rearrangement of magnetic flux in our simulations always results in a reduction of the scale height over time , so that the initial values of @xmath2 in our @xmath70 models is an upper limit for a real disk of high magnetization .",

    "the orbital period is @xmath119 , which is the time unit we adopt for our presentation .",
    "the typical growth time of the parker instability is given by the alfvn crossing time over the scale height @xmath120 while a characteristic gravitational contraction time is @xmath121 ( paper i ) .",
    "note that the parker instability involves vertical motions of gas , while fluid motions in the gravitational instability are mostly parallel to the galactic plane at least in the linear regime .",

    "the primary reason for this is of course that the parker instability is not a runaway process , but is eventually stabilized by tension forces from bent magnetic field lines ( cf , @xcite ) .    as the left frame of figure [ parker3d ] and figure",

    "the dominant mode in model a is trailing ( @xmath197 ) , as well .",
    "linear dispersion relations for the parker instability with rotation are independent of the sign of @xmath198 ( cf , @xcite ) , and we have found that for low - resolution simulations seeded with either leading or trailing modes , growth rates are similar .",
    "however , for the random perturbation form we adopt , trailing modes grow sooner because of a shorter readjustment phase , for the rotating cases . additional tests for the nonrotating case show that the growth of trailing and leading modes is indistinguishable .",
    "three - dimensional parker instability attains its maximum growth rate at @xmath199 , because larger @xmath200 provides more space for a raised section of a flux tube to expand in the radial direction @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite , however , the growth rate of @xmath201 mode is not very different from that of the @xmath202 modes and the growth rate is essentially constant for @xmath203 .",
    "since our high resolution simulations can resolve modes up to @xmath204 , the dominance of the @xmath205 modes in model a is physical rather than numerical .",
    "the dominance of this particular mode over potential rivals may in part be attributed to the shape of initial perturbation spectrum which has larger power at smaller @xmath200 , while larger-@xmath200 modes , if resolved , grow faster ; a compromise may then select intermediate-@xmath200 modes that have large enough initial power and fast enough growth rates .",
    "it is also possible that nonlinear effects help to select this mode , perhaps preferring @xmath1 close to the full disk thickness .",
    "we note that although uniform rotation tends to stabilize the parker instability since the coriolis force couples azimuthal and radial motions , its effect is not significant if @xmath206 ( cf , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to helping select trailing modes for initial growth , the effects of rotation are evident in other details of the model evolution .",
    "as material falls toward the midplane along wavy magnetic field lines , it also gains speed in the @xmath66 direction , and its path is consequently deflected in the @xmath207 direction by the coriolis force .",
    "gas moving toward a magnetic valley with positive ( negative ) @xmath208 is redirected radially outward ( inward ) .",
    "the net result is that over - dense regions at valleys tend to rotate in the counterclockwise direction , which in turn twists magnetic field lines in the valleys ( cf , @xcite ) . at the point when the instability begins to saturate ,",
    "gas at the valleys is slightly overcompressed and begins to reexpand vertically . at the same time , the fields lines that previously became twisted due to the coriolis forces now exert back torques , inducing gas motions in the clockwise direction .",
    "the meridional flows at the disk midplane , as displayed in figure [ col1]@xmath209 , show this sort of behavior .",
    "the flows are generally subsonic near the midplane , while high altitude regions ( @xmath210 ) have supersonic velocities .",
    "evolution of the system following saturation is rather complicated , involving nonlinear interactions of numerous mhd waves .",
    "overpressured , dense regions shown in figure [ col1]@xmath149 soon expand in the horizontal direction . expanding material interacts with gas that moves along the vertical direction .",
    "these active , but still mostly subsonic , flow motions eventually homogenize the density , resulting in a smooth surface density distribution ( fig .",
    "[ col1]@xmath211 ) . the maximum surface density after",
    "3 orbits is only 1.13 times the initial value .",
    "the small - scale chaotic flow associated with nonlinear development of large-@xmath212 modes is also likely to cause reconnection of the curved and twisted magnetic field lines , preferentially at low-@xmath42 regions ( cf , @xcite ) .",
    "this in turn reduces the field strength near the midplane , which was already decreased during the process of ( midplane - crossing ) parker instability .",

    "magnetic fields rise up and gas slips down , enhancing the mass - to - flux ratio further at the midplane ( fig .",
    "[ mass2flux0]@xmath209 ) , and evening out the @xmath17-distribution of magnetic flux ( fig .",
    "[ mass2flux0]@xmath149 ) , but mass enhancement near the midplane due to the parker instability is generally quite moderate ( fig .",
    "[ mass2flux0]@xmath148 ) . at the end of the simulation , the overall density profile in model a is very close to another hydrostatic equilibrium where the initial effective external force ( @xmath145 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ geff ] ] ) counterbalances the thermal pressure gradient alone . as figure [ mass2flux0]@xmath149 suggests , the mean magnetic field ( which is predominantly azimuthal ) is nearly constant with height , and therefore does not contribute much in the final force balance .",
    "at @xmath220 , the density - weighted velocity dispersions are calculated to be @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 , where @xmath224 denotes a volume average . given",
    "the low level of the velocity dispersion , the parker instability is unlikely a significant source of interstellar turbulence in galactic disks .",
    "one of the crucial impacts differential rotation makes on the evolution of the parker instability is that it changes the power spectrum of initial perturbations . in a shearing disk",
    ", the wavefront of any disturbance evolves in response to the kinematics of the background flow ; for uniform shear with @xmath225 , the radial wavenumber of any pattern linearly increases with time as @xmath226 . in our chosen initial density perturbation spectrum , the mode with @xmath227 and @xmath228 has much larger power than higher-@xmath200 modes at the same @xmath229 .",
    "the higher-@xmath200 modes , however , have higher growth rates than the @xmath202 modes .",
    "as a consequence of the initial power distribution , non - shearing model a thus has to spend about one orbital time before the ( large-@xmath200 ) parker modes grow enough to produce significant density fluctuation ( figure [ s25_evol]@xmath148 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the background shear in model b can transform the initial @xmath227 mode , without changing its power , into a higher-@xmath200 disturbance  for which the parker instability is more efficient .",
    "therefore , in figure [ s25_evol]@xmath148 the initial growth of perturbations is more evident in model b than in model a. structural analysis shows that this initially growing mode in model b is a _ @xmath17-symmetric _ ( in density ) mode with @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) and confined to @xmath232 .",
    "in contrast , the most unstable mode in model a is a _",

    "the growth rate of the @xmath234 mode in model b is found to be @xmath235 , which is just half of the growth rate of model a.    while the initial evolution of shearing model b is governed by the growth of @xmath17-symmetric modes near the midplane , @xmath17-antisymmetric perturbations that have lower initial power ( since @xmath236 is larger ) also grow in high altitude regions at double the rate . as they grow , over - dense regions fall down toward the midplane and",

    "magnetic field lines from model b appear straighter than from model a , suggesting that the ( longer - wavelength ) symmetric modes partially prevent the ( shorter - wavelength ) antisymmetric modes from crossing the midplane . as antisymmetric modes grow dominant later on ( @xmath241 ) , field lines become progressively more curved , but never to the extent seen in model a.    for shearing model b , antisymmetric modes culminate their growth at @xmath242 . after model saturation ,",
    "the system experiences vigorous interactions between symmetric and antisymmetric modes .",
    "an added complication is the background shear , which stretches out any condensation that forms .",
    "we plot snapshots of surface density @xmath243 in figure [ q1_col ] , which shows that at @xmath244 the system is dominated by high-@xmath200 modes , while surface density at @xmath245 is rather uniformly distributed . to some extent ,",
    "the smooth surface density is attributable to our limited numerical resolution .",
    "however , even if the true spatial scale at which dissipative processes smooth out strongly phase - mixed structures is small compared to our numerical resolution , there are evidently no nonlinear feedback processes to drive late - time growth of large - scale perturbations .",
    "overall , the late time character of the system is a new , large - scale vertical equilibrium containing small - scale , fluctuating density and velocity fields .",
    "the density - weighted dispersions of the perturbed velocity in model b at time @xmath220 are @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 , which are too small to be of much significance for the observable interstellar turbulence in galactic disks .    as mentioned before",
    ", symmetric modes in the shearing model b impede the midplane penetration of antisymmetric modes , resulting in less inflated field lines .",
    "the antisymmetric modes have half the azimuthal wavelength of the symmetric modes , and also shorter radial wavelengths , which helps perturbations squeeze across the midplane . nevertheless , the escape of magnetic flux into high altitude regions is significantly reduced .",
    "figure [ mass2flux1 ] shows the variations of @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 for model b. compared with figure [ mass2flux0 ] for non - sheared model a , figure [ mass2flux1 ] for model b illustrates that shear in the parker instability results in a configuration where magnetic flux is enhanced in two layers ( @xmath249 ) surrounding the midplane , while the corona has lower @xmath250 ( higher @xmath144 ) than the non - sheared case ( cf , @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the shearing background velocity , small - scale motions are chaotic , which can facilitate the reconnection of twisted magnetic field lines .",

    "mass2flux1]@xmath209 ) .    to summarize , we do not find any firm evidence that shear significantly stabilizes the parker instability .",
    "this may be because parker modes are the most unstable at large @xmath200 . by kinematically shifting the @xmath45-wavenumbers of perturbations at lowest @xmath236 and @xmath229 which have the largest initial amplitudes  and are associated with symmetric modes  the introduction of shear gives an early boost to symmetric modes .",
    "the more slowly - growing symmetric modes are later dominated by shorter - wavelength antisymmetric modes that grow more strongly ( but start from lower amplitudes ) .",

    "self - gravitating evolution of an unmagnetized , thick disk is generally very similar to that of a razor - thin disk , because without magnetic fields the induced motions are almost planar .",

    "even when bound clouds are created , the parker instability plays only an auxiliary role by helping secondary swing amplification ; the formation time scale and spacing of clouds are quite different from what the linear - theory parker analysis predicts .",
    "the final issue we address in this paper is the development of the magneto - jeans instability ( mji ) in a three - dimensional disk .",
    "we previously studied mji under uniform weak - shear conditions ( paper i ) , and under self - consistent spiral arm conditions ( paper ii ) , both in a height - integrated two - dimensional idealization .",
    "while the latter varying shear and varying density approach is more realistic , in this first three - dimensional study we adopt the simplified uniform model , which is adequate to capture the basic physical processes : model e has the same high - gas - density - parameter set ( @xmath252 , @xmath94 ) used in model d , but sets @xmath280 to represent better the reduced ( or negative ) shear that prevails within spiral arms ( see paper ii ) .    physically , mji is a form of nonaxisymmetric jeans instability in rotating disks containing embedded azimuthal magnetic fields .",
    "transverse ( alfvnic ) magnetic perturbations produce radial tension forces that resist the stabilizing effect of the coriolis force ; magnetic transfer of angular momentum allows secular contraction instead of epicyclic motion ( @xcite ; paper i ) . although mji is similar to the parker instability in that both rely on background azimuthal magnetic fields and nonaxisymmetric perturbations , they are otherwise completely different . the condition of low shear is essential for mji , because magnetosonic waves begin to quench the jeans instability when kinematic shear increases @xmath200 ; the parker instability , in contrast , prefers high @xmath200 .",
    "vertical motions are key in the parker instability , whereas mji involves primarily planar motions . since both have been proposed as possible ways to trigger formation of giant clouds in spiral arms , it is interesting to investigate nonlinear evolution when both instabilities can occur .",
    "based on model e , we conclude that mji , if present , always dominates the parker instability .",
    "although equation ( [ tpar ] ) suggests the parker instability can have a high initial growth rate , its development never produces highly nonlinear near - midplane density perturbations ( see solid line in fig .",
    "[ s25_evol]@xmath148 ) .",
    "as the dashed line in figure [ s25_evol]@xmath149 shows , the density in model e ( @xmath252 ) starts to grow immediately and this growth never saturates , just as we found for mji in paper i. we have also performed low - resolution simulations for mji in nonshearing disks with @xmath274 and 1.5 ( not listed in table [ tbl-1 ] ) , and confirmed that mji can drive them into gravitational runway .",
    "the time scale for bound cloud formation becomes longer as @xmath4 increases , so that disks with @xmath274 and 1.5 form dense clumps within 1 and 2 orbits , respectively , while model e with @xmath252 takes less than one orbital time to become fully unstable ( fig .  [",
    "s25_evol]@xmath149 ) .    in figure [ mji_vol ] , we plot perspective views of isodensity surfaces and magnetic field lines , together with midplane distributions of density , velocity , and magnetic fields , for model e at @xmath281 .",
    "as the perspective view shows , the magnetic fields run almost parallel to the @xmath45@xmath48 plane near @xmath282 , as do the velocity vectors even during highly nonlinear stages .",
    "centered at @xmath283 and @xmath284 , two condensations are produced within one orbital time ; these each contain 27% and 20% of the total mass , corresponding roughly to @xmath285 .",
    "as discussed in  3.2 for axisymmetric gravitational instabilities , the dilution of in - plane self - gravity due to the finite scale height also affects the most unstable scale lengths and growth rates of mji .",
    "the simple replacement @xmath286 is sufficient to take into account this geometrical dilution effect in an approximate fashion . utilizing equation ( 23 ) of paper i ( see also @xcite )",
    ", the instantaneous dispersion relation for mji in thick disks becomes @xmath287\\omega^2   + { v_{\\rm a}}^2{k_y}^2\\left({c_s}^2k^2 - 4\\pi g{\\rho_{00}}\\frac{kh}{1+kh}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "perturbations require @xmath290 ( nonaxisymmetric ) and @xmath291 , or @xmath292 to be unstable to mji ( see eq .",
    "[ [ h_inf ] ] for the definition of @xmath124 ) .",
    "note that the critical wavenumber @xmath293 of mji is independent of magnetic pressure ( except through @xmath2 ) and rotation , so that mji operates at smaller scales along the magnetic field than axisymmetric gravitational instability . since @xmath294 for @xmath295 ( fig .",
    "[ h_s0 ] ) , the condition for mji is roughly @xmath296 , which is similar to the instability criterion for the parker modes .",
    "using equation ( [ mji_disp ] ) and the results of  3.1 , we obtain the peak ( @xmath202 ) growth rates for mji for model e ( @xmath252 , @xmath94 and @xmath70 ) as a function of @xmath229 , and plot them in figure [ mji_growth ] . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the growth rates for the corresponding razor - thin disk .",
    "the maximum growth rate for a thick disk is @xmath297 at @xmath298 , so @xmath299 . since @xmath300 for our box",
    ", this would predict @xmath301 , i.e. , two @xmath45-aligned filaments .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the density structure in fig .",
    "[ mji_vol ] , although there is also a small contribution from the @xmath302 mode that has higher power from our initial conditions .",
    "note that the most unstable @xmath303 of mji is in fact the same as that of the dominant parker mode that grows in non - sheared model a , although that mode is midplane - antisymmetric in density . for both @xmath45- and @xmath48-scales comparable to @xmath304 ,",

    "consequently , the characteristic jeans mass is about four times bigger in a thick disk than the thin - disk prediction .",
    "we note that this result is consistent with simple prediction for an unmagnetized disk using the vertical equilibrium condition of equation ( [ h_inf ] ) : the central density is @xmath308 , and with the three - dimensional jeans wavelength @xmath309 , the nominal three - dimensional jeans mass would be @xmath310 . with @xmath311 ,",
    "the two - dimensional jeans mass is @xmath312 .",
    "a variety of evidence supports the idea that giant , star - forming clouds form as the result of large - scale collective effects ",
    "i.e. , dynamical instabilities .",
    "candidate mechanisms that have been proposed on the basis of linear - theory analysis include the swing amplifier @xcite , magneto - jeans instabilities ( @xcite ; paper i ) , and the parker instability @xcite .",
    "the first two of these involve primarily in - plane motions and are fundamentally driven by self - gravity , with either shear or magnetic tension acting to neutralize the stabilizing tendency of the coriolis force . for the third mechanism , vertical motion , driven by magnetic buoyancy ,",
    "is crucial .",
    "based on linear - theory growth rates and characteristic spatial scales , all of the above mechanisms could in principle be dynamically important under various galactic conditions . in practice , because giant clouds represent highly overdense regions compared to mean ism properties , it is important to understand how the candidate instability mechanisms develop in the _ nonlinear _ regime : i.e. , whether and/or how an instability saturates . addressing these questions requires direct numerical simulations to evolve the fluid dynamics equations into the nonlinear regime .    in previous work , we have investigated the nonlinear development of the swing and magneto - jeans mechanisms in a thin - disk ( two - dimensional ) approximation ( papers i , ii ) .",
    "here , we extend those studies by allowing for fully three - dimensional dynamics , which also enables us to investigate the nonlinear development of the parker instability allowing for rotation , shear , and self - gravity .",
    "our primary goals were to compare dynamical development , and especially `` final - state '' outcomes , of model disks under various conditions . by controlling for different physical effects ( i.e.",
    ", turning gravity , rotation , shear , and magnetic fields `` off '' and `` on '' ) , and exploring parameter space , we were able to assess the potential consequences for bound cloud formation of the various instabilities alone and in combination .",
    "the numerical models we adopt are radially localized , vertically stratified , shearing , isothermal disks with embedded magnetic field lines ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "the initial rate of shear in the background flow is measured by @xmath313 , and this overall shear gradient is maintained by enforcing sheared - periodic radial boundary conditions ; we study cases with @xmath116 and 0 . the initial magnetic field is assumed to be azimuthal and its vertical stratification",
    "is determined such that the alfvn speed @xmath314 is spatially constant .",
    "the density and magnetic field strength in our model disks are characterized by the toomre parameter @xmath4 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ toomre_q ] ] ) and the plasma parameter @xmath144 ( see eq .  [ [ beta ] ] ) , respectively .",
    "magnetic fields are either initiated at an equipartition level ( @xmath315 ) , or set to zero .",
    "we set up initial magnetohydrostatic equilibria with thermal and magnetic pressure gradients balancing gaseous self - gravity and external gravity from a stellar component .",
    "we adopt a linear model for the external ( stellar - disk ) gravity ( see eq .",
    "[ [ extg ] ] ) and parameterize its magnitude using @xmath84 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ s0 ] ] ) , which corresponds roughly to the ratio of the gas disk s vertical gravity to the external gravity at one scale height .",
    "the fiducial sets of parameters our model disks adopt are @xmath273 , @xmath93 for the `` average disk '' , and @xmath252 , @xmath94 for highly compressed spiral arm regions ; we also perform additional simulations with @xmath316 and @xmath93 .",
    "our simulation boxes are 8 scale - heights ( @xmath2 ) thick , with area either @xmath317 or @xmath318 in the @xmath45@xmath48 plane .",
    "the relation between dimensionless simulation parameters and physical scales is explained in  2.2 . for all our simulations ,",
    "we introduce a spectrum of low - amplitude random perturbations , and numerically integrate the ideal mhd equations up to four or five orbital periods . in  3 , we first constructed the density profiles for vertical static equilibria and calculated the variation of disk thickness as a function of @xmath84 (  3.1 ) , and then studied axisymmetric gravitational instability of these thick disk models (  3.2 ) .",
    "finite disk thickness reduces the critical value of the toomre stability parameter relative to the zero - thickness limit , and also increases the spatial scale required for instability .",
    "we found that for @xmath93 , @xmath0 , 0.72 , and 0.57 for @xmath78 , 10 , and 1 cases , respectively , suggesting that the average disk is highly stable to axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we also showed that a simple modification of the axisymmetric dispersion relation to account for finite thickness ( eq .  [ [ disp ] ] ) yields excellent agreement with the results of simulations for the value of @xmath63 .    in  4 , we present nonlinear evolution of fully three - dimensional disk models , first considering the parker instability in isolation (  4.1 ) , then investigating evolution of the swing and parker - swing mechanisms (  4.2 ) , and finally considering how self - gravitating perturbations grow under low shear conditions (  4.3 ) .      \\1 . in the absence of self - gravity ,",
    "the dominant growing parker mode under uniform rotation is found to be antisymmetric in density with respect to @xmath282 and tailing with radial wavelength @xmath319 and azimuthal wavelength @xmath195 , and has a growth rate @xmath320 .",
    "density fluctuations grow as over - dense regions slide toward the midplane along undulating magnetic field lines and unloaded portions of the field buoyantly rise , but growth slows as nonlinear saturation sets in . the maximum density at saturation is less than twice the initial midplane density .",
    "after saturation of the dominant parker mode , nonlinearly developed small - scale modes interact with each other , dispersing density structures characteristic of the parker instability .",
    "escape of magnetic flux across the vertical boundaries and likely reconnection of the twisted magnetic fields prompted by small - scale motions raise the mass - to - flux ratio near the midplane .",
    "the system progressively moves to a new global vertical equilibrium in which the magnetic field is nearly uniform , hence magnetic pressure support against gravity is negligible . in the saturated state , small scale fluctuating velocities are still present , but their density - weighted dispersions are less than 10% of the isothermal speed speed .",
    "when a disk is subject to differential rotation , midplane symmetric ( in density ) parker modes with @xmath231 are the first to dominate the evolution .",
    "this initial dominance is explained by the large initial amplitude of longer - wavelength perturbations , combined with the ability of shear to increase @xmath200 to the regime where parker instabilities are more efficient .",
    "smaller-@xmath303 antisymmetric modes start with lower amplitudes than the symmetric modes but grow more rapidly , moving gradually downwards from high altitudes to interact with the symmetric mode .",
    "the mode interaction reduces magnetic field line inflation and loss compared to the non - shearing case .",
    "the final state of the non - self - gravitating shearing disk model is similar to that of the non - shearing disk , consisting of an overall vertical equilibrium with small - scale , low - amplitude fluctuations in density and velocity fields .",
    "when we include both self - gravity and uniform shear in our models , the nonlinear evolution of structure is principally dominated by the swing amplification mechanism , although parker modes play a role in seeding structure .",
    "low-@xmath4 ( @xmath252 ) disk models end in gravitational runaway , while high-@xmath4 ( @xmath273 ) disk models remain extremely stable . in both high and low @xmath4 limits , the ultimate outcome is decided independent of the presence or absence of magnetic fields .",
    "when @xmath4 is marginal ( @xmath316 ) , on the other hand , we find that only magnetized models form bound condensations , suggesting that parker instability may play a supplementary role in destabilization .",
    "the parker instability raises the level of density fluctuation and may help channel power in the saturated state into small wavenumber modes .",
    "it is the `` rejuvenated '' swing amplification ( see paper i ) that ultimately drives the system to form dense condensations , however . for cases in which bound clouds",
    "do form , the sizes and spacings are not characteristic of parker modes , but comparable to the results from thin disk models ( with typical masses @xmath321 times the thin disk jeans mass )",
    ".    \\4 . weakly shearing thick disks , like thin disks , are susceptible to the magneto - jeans instability ( mji ) , in which tension forces from azimuthal magnetic fields vitiate the stabilizing coriolis force .",
    "the azimuthal wavelength criterion for mji in finite - thickness disks is similar to that of the parker instability ( @xmath322 ) , and modal growth rates are also similar .",
    "our nonlinear simulations show , however , that mji under weak - shear ( spiral arm ) conditions is ultimately much more violent than the parker instability , and can form dense condensations within one orbital time .",
    "this is because the parker instability is self - limiting , whereas the mji is a runaway process .",
    "the mass of dense condensations amounts typically to the thick - disk jeans mass ( @xmath100 4 times the thin - disk jeans mass ) .",
    "the numerical simulations in this paper suggest that formation of bound clouds can not occur as a direct consequence of parker instability , although parker instability may play a role in seeding swing amplification in high - shear environments or mji in regions of weak shear .",
    "there are several reasons why the parker instability is ineffective at producing large , dense clouds .",
    "first , although the growth time of the parker instability from linear - theory analyses is a few times @xmath323 yrs ( cf , @xcite ) , the process does not proceed in a runaway fashion , but is stabilized at a relatively modest density by magnetic tension forces ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , while the undular parker instability prefers wavelengths in the azimuthal direction @xmath324 ( i.e. , @xmath325 in rough agreement with observed spacing between molecular complexes ) , there is no similar preferred scale in the radial direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "growth rates increase slowly with @xmath200 , and are nearly uniform for @xmath203 . indeed ,",
    "even though the initial perturbation amplitudes in our simulations increase toward large scale , we find that small-@xmath1 modes dominate the evolution .",
    "the results is long filamentary structures with a radial spacing about 10 times smaller than the azimuthal spacing in surface density maps during the initial growing phase ( see fig .",
    "[ col1 ] ) . because the perturbed self - gravitational potential @xmath326 is increasingly small for large @xmath200 , effects of self - gravity on development of the parker - jeans instability are weak for the dominant nonlinear modes .",
    "third , while two - dimensional simulations for the parker instability inarguably reach @xcite - type final static equilibrium configurations ( cf , @xcite ) , three - dimensional simulations ( @xcite , and this work ) indicate that such equilibrium configurations are transient at best , evolving rapidly into a state where density is relatively smooth in the horizontal direction .",
    "it is unclear whether this transition is initiated by an instability of the static undulating configurations , as claimed by @xcite , by active magnetic reconnection near the midplane caused by small - scale chaotic motions , or simply by comparable nonlinear saturation levels of many high-@xmath200 modes . when shear is present , kinematically driven phase mixing contributes to washing out large - scale radial structures . in any case , the three - dimensional simulations show that it is almost impossible to find any signature of the undular parker instability in the later stages of evolution .",
    "the result that parker instability can not _ directly _ account for gmc formation has previously been emphasized by other authors .",
    "@xcite , for example , find only a maximum factor of 1.5 enhancement in surface density in their three - dimensional non - self - gravitating simulations with solid - body rotation , and conclude that parker mode",
    "_ alone _ can not be responsible for forming molecular clouds ( see also e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these authors speculate on the possibility of the parker instability coupled with other physical processes such as self - gravity , differential rotation , radiative cooling , and spiral arm potentials .",
    "we show in the present paper that self - gravity and galactic differential rotation are not much help .",
    "therefore , we argue that _ the parker instability , even combined with gaseous self - gravity and differential rotation , can not be regarded as the primary formation mechanism for giant molecular clouds at least in galactic disks at large_. while effects on the parker instability of stronger self - gravity and rapidly varying shear inside spiral arms have yet to be studied in detail , we do not anticipate significant differences in the main conclusions .",
    "although the width of a spiral arm might help in promoting parker modes of similar @xmath1 over shorter - wavelength competitors ( cf . , @xcite ) , it is not yet clear how effective this can be if the arm transit time is comparable to the growth time .    while larger or smaller shear rates do not seem to alter the basic character of parker instabilities appreciably , the shear rate is crucial for selecting which type of ( in - plane ) gravitating amplifier can operate . in a weakly shearing regions ,",
    "swing is absent , but the mji is very powerful at initiating self - gravitational condensations . in paper",
    "i , we showed mji is a potential means to prompt observed active star formation near the central parts of galaxies where rotation curves are nearly rigid - body ( see also @xcite ) . in paper ii , we argued that observed spur structures jutting radially outwards from spiral arms can be understood as a direct consequence of the mji occurring within the arms . a spiral arm potential has three important effects on the gaseous medium .",
    "( 1 ) by compressing gas , the jeans length  which determines the preferred mji scale along the mean magnetic field  is reduced ; the growth time for self - gravitating modes also drops .",
    "( 2 ) the spatially - varying density distribution causes a gradient in the shear profile perpendicular to the arm ; since transiting gas first experiences reversed shear and then returns to normal shear , the spatially - varying profile tends to keep radial wavenumbers small within the arm , which enhances the efficiency of mji .",
    "( 3 ) it reduces the radial scale length for mass collection by mji to at most the arm width , so that the masses of clumps produced are limited .    compared to our previous results from razor - thin disks , the weaker self - gravity in three dimensions",
    "could imply somewhat more massive ( @xmath327 ) clouds would tend to form from mji under realistic conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the weaker self - gravity may allow stronger spiral potential perturbations that give a higher density contrast between arm and interarm regions in stable quasi - axisymmetric spiral shock profiles ( cf .",
    "paper ii ) .",
    "the jeans mass at the spiral arm density peak could be correspondingly smaller , producing lower mass clouds in three - dimensional spiral arm regions .",
    "since the marginal wavenumber of mji parallel to @xmath32 is about the same as that of the parker instability in spiral arm conditions ( see  4.3 ) , one might expect some cooperation between mji and the parker instability inside spiral arms .",
    "the present models under uniform in - plane background conditions do not point to significant modifications of the nonlinear mji by parker modes .",
    "effects from parker - mji interactions could be more prominent with a realistic spiral arm model ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , however , and it would be particularly interesting to learn whether the final mass scale changes markedly compared to predictions from uniform disk models .    by focusing on cases with relatively strong ( @xmath144=1 ) equilibrium azimuthal magnetic fields in our mhd models",
    ", we have concentrated solely on effects of the parker instability and mji in the present work .",
    "an additional dynamical process prevalent in magnetized disk systems is the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) . because mris are most vigorous in their small - scale growth when the thermal pressure is large compared to magnetic pressure ( @xmath328 ) , they have been studied primarily in the context of accretion disks .",
    "however , @xcite have argued that the mri may also be important in producing turbulence in galactic disks where the effective value of @xmath144 is close to unity , citing as evidence the significant nonthermal velocity dispersions ( @xmath329 ) present in outer disks with low local star formation rates and apparent gravitational stability .",
    "it is of great interest to investigate whether coupling between the mri and self - gravitating modes under galactic conditions could represent an important new mechanism for forming large - scale ism condensations .",

    "<S> various instabilities have been proposed as candidates to prompt the condensation of giant , star - forming cloud complexes from the diffuse interstellar medium . here , we use three - dimensional ideal mhd simulations to investigate nonlinear development of the parker , magneto - jeans ( mji ) , and swing mechanisms in galactic disk models . </S>",
    "<S> the disk models are local , isothermal , and begin from a vertically - stratified magnetohydrostatic equilibrium state with both gaseous and stellar gravity . we allow for a range of surface densities and rotational shear profiles , as well as unmagnetized control models . </S>",
    "<S> we first construct axisymmetric equilibria and examine their stability . </S>",
    "<S> finite disk thickness reduces the critical toomre stability parameter below unity ; we find @xmath0 , 0.72 , and 0.57 for zero , sub - equipartition , and equipartition magnetic field cases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we then pursue fully three - dimensional models . in non - self - gravitating cases , the peak mid - disk density enhancement from the `` pure '' parker instability is less a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant growing modes have radial wavelengths @xmath1 comparable to the disk scale height @xmath2 , much shorter than the azimuthal wavelength ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> shearing disks , being more favorable to midplane - symmetric modes , have somewhat different late - time magnetic field profiles from nonshearing disks , but otherwise saturated states are similar . </S>",
    "<S> late - time velocity fluctuations at 10% of the sound speed persist , but no characteristic structural signatures of parker modes remain in the new quasi - static equilibria . in self - gravitating cases , </S>",
    "<S> the development of density structure is qualitatively similar to our previous results from thin - disk simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the parker instability , although it may help seed structure or tip the balance under marginal conditions , appears to play a secondary role  not affecting , for example , the sizes or spacings of the bound structures that form . in shearing disks with @xmath4 less than a threshold level @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> swing amplification can produce bound clouds of a few times the local jeans mass . </S>",
    "<S> the most powerful cloud - condensing mechanism , requiring low - shear conditions as occur in spiral arms or galactic centers , appears to be the mji . in thick disks , </S>",
    "<S> the mji occurs for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that condensations of a local jeans mass ( @xmath7 ) grow very rapidly , supporting the idea that mji is at least partly responsible for the formation of bound cloud complexes in spiral galaxies . </S>"
