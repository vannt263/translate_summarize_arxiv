    "degeneracies of eigenvalues of matrices dependent on parameters is a problem of great importance in physics .",
    "the interest in this problem goes back to hamilton @xcite who pointed out a conical refraction due to coincident eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "later , the significance of degeneracies of matrix spectra has been revealed in quantum physics @xcite , crystal optics @xcite and chemistry @xcite .",
    "eigenvalue degeneracies are also essential for an understanding of the spectral fluctuations @xcite and the onset of quantum chaos @xcite . among those degeneracies ,",
    "one finds the exceptional points ( eps ) @xcite where two riemann sheets of the eigenvalues are entangled by the square - root type of singularity .",
    "the eps are generic singularities and , hence , can be found in numerous situations , e.g. the resonance problems @xcite or the quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "much effort has been devoted to studies of degeneracies associated with avoided crossings in quantal spectra , focusing mainly on the topological structure of hilbert space and the geometric phase @xcite which a quantum system acquires when transported adiabatically around the singularity in parameter space @xcite .",
    "these novel effects have attracted a considerable experimental interest as well @xcite .    in many - body systems , eps have been studied in schematic models , such as the lipkin model @xcite , the interacting boson model @xcite and , recently , the 3-level pairing model @xcite which belongs to a general class of the richardson - gaudin models @xcite . in the latter case , it has been found that eigenvalue crossings in the complex - extended parameter space of the hamiltonian and the reduction in the number of eps uniquely define the quantum integrable system @xcite .",
    "if true , this conjecture opens a possibility for studies of fingerprints of the chaotic dynamics in the quantum regime for small dimensional hilbert spaces .    in the case of closed quantum system ( cqs ) described by a hermitian hamiltonian ,",
    "mixing of two eigenvalues leads generically to the level repulsion and the avoided level crossing . in the open quantum system ( oqs )",
    ", eigenvalues corresponding to unbound levels may exhibit not only crossing of either energies or widths but also true degeneracies due to a joint crossing of both energies and widths .",
    "the latter case corresponds to a degenerate double pole of the scattering matrix ( s - matrix ) @xcite .",
    "hence , oqs is a natural system to look for singularities of the ep type .",
    "first attempt to search for eps in the realistic many - body model of atomic nucleus has been made recently using the real - energy continuum shell model @xcite , the so - called shell model embedded in the continuum ( smec ) @xcite , which is defined in projected hilbert spaces with at most two particles in the scattering continuum .",
    "the total function space of the @xmath0-particle system in smec consists of two sets : the set of square - integrable functions @xmath1 , used in the standard nuclear shell model ( sm ) , and the set of continuum states ( the environment of the cqs ) @xmath2 embedding the sm . in one - particle continuum problems , channels",
    "@xmath3 are determined by the motion of an unbound particle in a state @xmath4 relative to the @xmath5 nucleus in a certain sm state @xmath6 .",
    "an index + denotes an outgoing asymptotics of a continuum state @xmath7 .",
    "eigenstates of the oqs are found by solving the eigenvalue problem for an effective hamiltonian : @xmath8 in the function space @xmath1 of discrete states .",
    "indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 in ( [ heff ] ) denote the projected hilbert subspaces with 0 and 1 nucleon in the scattering continuum , respectively .",
    "@xmath11   is the green function of a single nucleon in the @xmath10 subspace . whereas the sm hamiltonian ( @xmath12 ) is hermitian",
    ", @xmath13 is an energy dependent , non - hermitian operator above the particle emission threshold and a hermitian operator below the emission threshold . for each total angular momentum @xmath14 and parity @xmath15 separately , the @xmath16 coupling term in ( [ heff ] ) gives rise to an external mixing of different sm states @xmath17 via the coupling to common decay channels , both closed and opened .",
    "the amount of this external mixing depends on the position of considered sm states with respect to the decay channel thresholds @xcite .",
    "more details about the smec approach and its recent applications can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the one - proton continuum of @xmath18ne to look for a possible ep with @xmath19 in a physically relevant region of excitation energies and parameters of the smec . for the sm hamiltonian ( @xmath12 in ( [ heff ] ) )",
    "we take the zbm hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the residual coupling @xmath20 between @xmath9-subspace and the embedding continuum is given by : @xmath21 .",
    "the true degeneracy of two @xmath22 resonances is searched for by varying the strength parameter @xmath23 in @xmath20 and the total energy @xmath24 of @xmath18ne .",
    "@xmath25 is chosen at the lowest one - proton emission threshold .",
    "in present studies , we consider the coupling of @xmath22 sm states to three lowest decay channels in @xmath18ne : @xmath26}^{{0}^{+}}$ ] ( the elastic channel ) , @xmath27}^{{0}^{+}}$ ] , and @xmath28}^{{0}^{+}}$ ] .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath13 is due to the coupling of discrete states of @xmath18ne to the decay channels @xmath29}^{{j}^{\\pi''}}$ ] .",
    "this coupling depends explicitly on @xmath24 . for @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath13 is complex - symmetric and its eigenvalues are complex .    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows energies and widths of @xmath31 , @xmath32 eigenvalues as a function of the total energy of @xmath18ne for a fixed value of the strength @xmath33 mev@xmath34@xmath35 of the residual coupling @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 eigenstates and eigenvectors of @xmath36 coalesce at @xmath37 , forming an ep . encircling this singularity in a parameter space of @xmath13 , reveals a topological phase in @xmath31 , @xmath32 eigenvectors .",
    "one can see a strong variation of @xmath31 and @xmath32 eigenvalues in the vicinity of thresholds for channels @xmath38}^{0^+}$ ] and @xmath39}^{0^+}$ ] , respectively .",

    "one should also notice that the energy @xmath24 of the lowest ep with @xmath19 does not necessarily correspond to the resonance energy which in smec is determined by solving a fixed - point equation for eigenvalues @xmath40 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "real part of energies in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are plotted with respect to an arbitrarily chosen zero on the axis @xmath42 and only relative differences are meaningful . in the case considered in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , if the ground state energy with respect to the elastic threshold ( @xmath25 ) is fixed at @xmath43 mev or @xmath44 mev , then the energy of the @xmath32 state obtained from the fixed - point equation becomes @xmath45 mev or 6.251 mev , respectively .",
    "one should stress an essential role of non - hermiticity of @xmath13 in this problem .",
    "the hermitian hamiltonian can be always diagonalized and eigenvalues , even if degenerate , always correspond to distinct eigenvectors .",
    "on the contrary , in the non - hermitian hamiltonian one may find non - trivial jordan blocks of eigenfunctions and singular points in a parameter space of the hamiltonian where both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce .",
    "these eps have drastic effects on systems behavior , as we shall examine below on the example of spectroscopic factors .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows real and imaginary parts of the one - proton spectroscopic factor @xmath46^{^+}}\\rangle$ ] for the four lowest @xmath22 states in @xmath18ne .",
    "this spectroscopic factor comes from a coupling of @xmath47 states ( @xmath48 ) of @xmath18ne to the ground state @xmath49 of @xmath50f .",
    "the strength of the residual @xmath51-force coupling between @xmath9-subspace and the embedding continuum ( @xmath52 mev@xmath34@xmath35 ) is chosen to reproduce an experimental width of @xmath53 state in @xmath50f .",
    "analogously , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] exhibit the @xmath54^{^+}}\\rangle$ ] and @xmath55^{^-}}\\rangle$ ] spectroscopic factors , respectively .",
    "these spectroscopic factors result from a coupling to the first ( @xmath56 ) and the second ( @xmath57 ) excited states in the daughter nucleus @xmath50f .",
    "imaginary part of the spectroscopic factor , which appears for energies above the first one - proton emission threshold ( @xmath30 ) , yields the uncertainty of a real part and is related to the decaying nature of considered @xmath22 states . for deeply bound states , an external mixing of sm states due to the coupling to common decay channels can be safely neglected and , hence , the spectroscopic factor calculated in smec becomes close to the sm value .",
    "this tendency can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] for @xmath58 .    figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] exhibit the external mixing of @xmath19 sm states by showing the @xmath24-dependence of spectroscopic factors for corresponding @xmath22 smec eigenstates .",
    "this mixing is strongly dependent on the structure of individual @xmath22 sm states , the position of different one - proton emission thresholds , and the total energy @xmath24 of @xmath18ne .",
    "one can see in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] that the one - proton spectroscopic factors are large for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the eigenstate @xmath59 has only a sizeable @xmath60^{^-}}\\rangle$ ] spectroscopic factor .",
    "one can notice two distinct phenomena in the @xmath24-dependence of spectroscopic factors : the threshold effect and the ep effect .",
    "the particle - emission threshold is a branch point in oqss @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ fig2]-[fig4 ] , one may notice a strong effect of the coupling to all three decay channels @xmath61}^{0^+}$ ] ( the elastic channel ) , @xmath62}^{0^+}$ ] , and @xmath63}^{0 ^ -}$ ] for a pair of eigenstates @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "remaining @xmath22 states are effectively decoupled showing a weak @xmath24-dependence of spectroscopic factors in the vicinity of thresholds .",
    "the threshold effect is well localized in @xmath24 and leads to mutually compensating variations in spectroscopic factors for strongly coupled @xmath31 and @xmath32 eigenstates of @xmath13 .",
    "these compensating variations of single - particle occupancies is a signature of an entanglement of the two externally coupled states in the scattering continuum . in other words , one can not define any matrix element or expectation value of an operator which does not commute with the hamiltonian on an individual state of the entangled couple of eigenstates .",
    "the effect of an ep at @xmath37 leads to much stronger variations of all three spectroscpic factors : @xmath46^{^+}}\\rangle$ ] , @xmath54^{^+}}\\rangle$ ] , and @xmath55^{^-}}\\rangle$ ] for @xmath31 and @xmath32 states .",
    "the same compensation mechanism as seen in the vicinity of the thresholds is found for spectroscopic factors in @xmath31 and @xmath32 states .",
    "however , since the strength of the residual coupling ( @xmath52 mev@xmath34@xmath35 ) does not correspond to an exact value ( @xmath33 mev@xmath34@xmath35 ) for which the true degeneracy of eigenvalues has been found , the variations seen are caused by the proximity of the ep and _ not _ by the ep itself . as a result , the ep effect is weaker in magnitude and less concentrated in energy @xmath24 than expected at an exact position of the ep .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the intricate entanglement of two continuum states caused by the ep is seen not only at the singularity point in parameter space of the hamiltonian ( @xmath64 mev@xmath34@xmath35 ) but also relatively far away from it . in that sense , it is a robust phenomenon relatively weakly dependent on a fine - tuning of the hamiltonian parameters and apt to be observed in nuclear physics experiments .",
