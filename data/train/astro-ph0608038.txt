    "the taurus - auriga star - forming region is a relatively nearby ( 140 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) molecular cloud complex , which is characterized by lower extinction and more isolated , low - mass star formation than other star - forming regions at comparable distances , like ophiuchus ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kh95 ) .",
    "it is therefore fairly well - studied from wavelengths ranging from the x - rays to the radio and used to test theoretical predictions of the star formation process . given the young age of the taurus complex ( 12 myr ) , many of its pre - main - sequence stars are still surrounded by material left over from their formation process and accrete gas and dust from circumstellar disks .",
    "dust grains in these disks are heated by irradiation from the star and from the accretion shocks at the stellar surface , as well as by local viscous dissipation @xcite , and emit excess emission , i.e.  at flux levels above those expected from a stellar photosphere , at infrared wavelengths .",
    "most disks have flared disk surfaces , i.e. the disk thickness increases more steeply than just linearly with radius ; this flaring allows disks to absorb more radiation from the central source than a flat , thin disk , and thus to become hotter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    over time , accretion rates decrease , and , while the disk material is depleted , some of the dust and gas could be built into planets .",
    "young , low - mass ( @xmath1 ) stars surrounded by these accretion disks are referred to as classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) . once accretion has virtually stopped and disks are either passive , i.e. only reprocessing stellar radiation , or already dissipated , a young star is called a weak - lined t tauri star ( wtts ) .",
    "the distinction between cttss and wttss is based on the equivalent width of their h@xmath2 emission line ( ew[h@xmath2 ] ) : cttss have broad and asymmetric h@xmath2 line profiles , which are generated in the magnetospheric accretion flows @xcite , resulting in an ew[h@xmath2 ] larger than 10  , while wttss have an ew[h@xmath2 ] of less than 10  ; in wttss , strong surface magnetic fields provide the energy for strong x - ray , uv , and h@xmath2 emission .    based on an evolutionary sequence derived from the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the infrared @xcite , young , low - mass stars are divided into three classes .",
    "class i objects have rising seds over the infrared spectral range , while class ii objects have either flat or somewhat decreasing seds ; class iii objects have little infrared excess , and their seds can be understood as reddened stellar photospheres for wavelengths @xmath4 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "thus , class ii objects are characterized by the presence of mid - infrared excess emission due to dust in circumstellar disks , while class iii objects have , for the most part , already dissipated their disks , and therefore their infrared flux is close to photospheric levels .",
    "classical t tauri stars fall into the class ii category ; weak - lined t tauri stars can be considered class ii or class iii objects , depending on the presence of disks around them .",
    "when a young star has almost completely dissipated its circumstellar material , it is usually classified as a class iii object . therefore , all class iii objects are wttss , but not all wttss are class iii objects , as defined by their infrared seds",
    ".    mid - infrared spectra of t tauri stars ( mostly cttss ) reveal the details of the thermal emission by dust grains in the inner regions of circumstellar disks , from a few tenths to several au from the central object . by deriving the structure and composition of the dust in protoplanetary disks , we can study the conditions and processes leading to planetary formation .",
    "in particular , dust growth and settling are seen as key steps in the formation of larger bodies .    the _ _ spitzer space telescope @xcite enables us , for the first time , to obtain spectra from 5 to 36 @xmath0 m of t tauri stars covering a variety of flux densities , from tens of mjy to tens of jy . as part of a larger infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ? * ) guaranteed - time observing program , we observed 150 young stellar objects in the taurus - auriga star - forming region , ranging in evolutionary state from the protostellar , or class i , stage , when a forming star is still enshrouded by an envelope , to the class ii and iii stages , when disk material is accreted and dissipated .",
    "our taurus sample is largely based on the sample studied by kh95 , who compiled and analyzed photometric data of known young stellar objects in the taurus - auriga star - forming region . here",
    "we present 85 irs spectra of class ii objects and 26 spectra of class iii objects ; the remaining spectra of the class i objects in our sample will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "we analyze the spectral energy distributions and irs spectra of class ii and iii objects in terms of common features and peculiarities arising from their disk structure , the properties of dust grains embedded within , and their surrounding environment .",
    "the large - scale environment has little impact on objects in taurus , unlike young stars in ob associations or young clusters , where the cluster members are subject to the influence of high - energy radiation and powerful winds from the ob stars .    in @xmath5 [ obs_data_reduction ]",
    "we introduce our _ spitzer _ irs observations and data reduction ; in @xmath5 [ sample ] we present spectral energy distributions , from the optical to the far - infrared , of the class ii and iii objects in our sample , as well as a morphological sequence of the irs spectra of our 85 class ii objects ; in @xmath5 [ analysis ] we compare our data with a set of accretion disk models to infer some disk properties , present a new median of mid - infrared fluxes of class ii objects in taurus , and estimate upper limits for dust masses around our class iii objects .",
    "we discuss some of our results in @xmath5 [ discuss ] , and give our conclusions in @xmath5 [ conclude ] .",
    "all but three of our taurus targets were observed with the irs on _ spitzer _ during irs observing campaigns 3 and 4 , from 2004 february 6 to 8 , and from 2004 february 27 to march 5 .",
    "the remaining three targets ( fq tau , gk tau , and v830 tau ) were observed during irs campaign 12 , from 2004 august 30 to 31 .",
    "for all targets the full mid - ir spectrum from 5 to 40 @xmath0 m was obtained by either using the two low - resolution irs modules ( short - low [ sl ] and long - low [ ll ] , 5.214 @xmath0 m and 1438 @xmath0 m , respectively , @xmath6/@xmath7 @xmath8 90 ) or the sl module and the two high - resolution modules ( short - high [ sh ] and long - high [ lh ] , 1019 @xmath0 m and 1937 @xmath0 m , respectively , @xmath6/@xmath7 @xmath8 600 ) .",
    "the high - resolution modules were usually only used for observations of bright ( @xmath9 a few jy ) targets . while some targets were observed in irs staring mode , most of them were observed in mapping mode ; with the latter , a 2@xmath103 step map on the target was carried out , with three steps separated by three - quarters ( for sl ) or half ( for the other modules ) of the slit width in the dispersion direction and two steps of one third of a slit length in the spatial direction . for staring mode observations ,",
    "the target was placed subsequently in two nod positions along the spatial direction of the slit , at 1/3 and 2/3 of the slit length , respectively .    as a first step in the data reduction process",
    ", we fixed all bad pixels in the arrays ( identified by the pixel masks , and including the so - called `` rogue pixels '' in sh and lh ) using a simple interpolation over neighboring , good pixels .",
    "we then extracted and calibrated our spectra using the smart software tool @xcite . when taking low - resolution spectra , the target",
    "is first placed on the slit yielding the 2nd order spectrum and then on the slit yielding the 1st order spectrum ; each time both orders are observed .",
    "we subtracted the sky background by using observations taken at the same nod position , but in different orders .",
    "the spectra were extracted using a variable - width column extraction , which varies with the width of the point - spread function , and calibrated with @xmath2 lac ( a1 v ) and its template spectrum @xcite . for the high - resolution spectra , the spectra of target and calibrator , @xmath11 dra ( k2 iii ) ,",
    "were extracted using a full slit extraction .    even though we were not able to subtract any sky background from our high - resolution spectra , the contribution from any background emission was only noticeable in our lh spectra . to correct for this contribution",
    ", we applied a scalar correction to each lh spectrum to achieve a smooth transition at 19 @xmath0 m , where sh and lh meet .",
    "our sh spectra usually matched the flux level of our sl spectra in the overlap region between sl and sh ( 10 - 14 @xmath0 m ) ; given the smaller aperture and shorter wavelength coverage of sh , any background contribution is expected to be negligible .",
    "all of our high - resolution data presented in this paper were rebinned to a resolution of @xmath6/@xmath7 = 200 , and the sh data were truncated below 13 @xmath0 m .",
    "the rebinning of our sh and lh spectra resulted in a clearer representation of the shape of the continuum and in a more homogeneous set of spectra , independent of the modules used for @xmath12 14 @xmath0 m .    for mapping mode observations , we extracted and calibrated all map positions , but the final spectrum was usually obtained by averaging the two observations in the map s center . for staring mode observations",
    ", the final spectrum is an average of the two nod positions .",
    "we estimate our absolute spectrophotometric accuracy to be of the order of 10% , in some cases as good as 5% .",
    "the scatter of neighboring flux values determines our relative accuracy and thus our ability to reliably identify spectral features .",
    "this relative accuracy depends not only on the brightness of the object , but also on the modules used : while in sl , and usually also in ll2 ( 14 - 21 @xmath0 m ) and in sh , spectral features above the noise level can be considered real , the ll1 ( 20 - 36 @xmath0 m ) and especially the lh spectra are often dominated by artifacts due to unresolved calibration issues , which makes the identification of real features difficult . therefore , spectral features beyond 20 @xmath0 m need careful checking before they are identified .",
    "in addition , the wavelength region between 13.5 and 14.5 @xmath0 m , where sl and ll meet , is affected by larger uncertainty in the calibration at the order edges and by possible flux mismatches between sl and ll . in some cases a spectral feature seems to appear in this wavelength region ; at this point , we are not sure whether this is a real feature or just an artifact introduced by the order edges .    it should be noted that many of our targets are members of close multiple systems , ranging in separation from tenths of an arcsecond to several arcseconds ( see tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "given that the narrowest irs slit width is 36 ( sl ) , several targets could not be resolved by our observations .",
    "for these targets , we show the combined spectrum of the unresolved components ; however , in many cases one component clearly dominates the mid - ir spectrum . for a small group of targets ,",
    "a companion entered only partially in the wider slits ( 47 for sh , 106 for ll , 111 for lh ) and more fully at the longer wavelength ends of these modules .",
    "for these objects we made sure that the contribution of the companion was small before interpreting the object s spectrum , or we excluded the `` contaminated '' part of the spectrum from the analysis .    a few objects presented problems in their reduction ; they will be listed below .",
    "+ _ it tau .",
    "_ this classical t tauri star is a 24 binary .",
    "both components entered the sl and ll slits , even though some flux of the b component was lost at longer sl wavelengths due to the larger size of the point - spread function .",
    "the a component should dominate the short - wavelength part of the irs spectrum ; however , it is likely that in ll ( @xmath13 14 @xmath0 m ) a and b contribute about equally , since irac measurements @xcite indicate that the contribution of the b component to the total flux of the system increases from 15% at 3.6 @xmath0 m to @xmath8 30% at 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "this is also suggested by the irs spectrum , where we multiplied sl by 1.25 to match it with ll , thus creating a combined spectrum for a and b. due to this scaling the sl spectrum of it tau carries a large uncertainty .",
    "+ _ cw tau , v773 tau .",
    "_ these two objects are part of a mispointed mapping - mode observation .",
    "we created continuous irs spectra by using the brightest map positions for each star ; however , due to likely slit losses the absolute flux levels and , to a lesser degree , the shape of the spectra could be off .",
    "+ _ cx tau , fn tau , fo tau . _",
    "the spectra of these objects were also affected by mispointed observations , and therefore their irs spectra are less accurate .",
    "+ _ mho 3 .",
    "_ this young star is so bright that a small part of its ll spectrum ( from about 22 to 26 @xmath0 m ) was saturated . + _ ab aur , ry tau .",
    "_ these objects are also very bright and partly saturated the central map position in sl .",
    "we recovered an unsaturated spectrum by using an off - center map position for sl and scaled it to match the sh and lh observations .",
    "+ _ v892 tau .",
    "_ due to the brightness of this star , sl and lh were partly saturated .",
    "similarly to ry tau , we used off - center map positions for sl and lh and matched them to the central map observation of sh .",
    "the targets of our taurus sample were selected from the objects analyzed by kh95 , and from objects in the _ iras _ faint source catalogue , selected on the basis of their infrared colors .",
    "for the latter , we used a filter on the brightness and on the 12/25 , 25/60 , and 60/100 @xmath0 m flux ratios ( the first one being the most important one ) : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , similar to @xcite .",
    "sources from the faint source catalogue that do not have common names are labeled with their _ iras _ identifier , e.g. f04101 + 3103 .",
    "spectral indices have commonly been used to classify the seds of protostars and pre - main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "the slope of the sed from the near- to the mid - infrared ( 2.225 @xmath0 m ) in a log - log plot is used to define class i , ii , and iii objects : @xmath17 where n @xmath13 0 identifies a class i object , @xmath18 a class ii object , and @xmath19 a class iii object .",
    "a value of @xmath20 of @xmath21 is equivalent to a stellar photosphere .",
    "however , this is just a simple classification scheme , since it does not take into account the detailed shape of the sed in this wavelength range ; it describes the shape of the sed from 2 to 25 @xmath0 m as a simple power law @xmath22 .",
    "for example , some objects identified as class i objects might actually be class ii objects with cleared - out inner disk regions , which are characterized by little excess emission at near - ir wavelengths and a large mid - ir excess , resulting in a steep slope of the near- to mid - infrared sed .",
    "only mid - ir spectra reveal spectral features that can aid in the detailed evolutionary classification of a young stellar object , like the presence of the 10-@xmath0 m silicate emission feature , which is indicative of a flared circumstellar disk .",
    "we separated our sample into class ii and iii sources based on the existence of an infrared excess in the irs spectral range .",
    "this subdivision resulted in a reclassification of some objects previously identified based on their sed slope between 2 and 25 @xmath0 m . since the 25-@xmath0 m data points were usually derived from _",
    "iras _ measurements with limited spatial resolution and lower sensitivity , many previous classifications were more uncertain . reclassification was done for fp tau , v836 tau , vy tau , and zz tau , which were originally classified as class iii objects ( e.g. , kh95 ) , and for di tau and hbc 423 , which were considered class ii objects .",
    "also , we reclassified a few class ii objects as class i objects due to the presence of ice and silicate absorption features in their irs spectra , as well as their sed shape ; among these objects are coku tau/1 , hl tau , and lkha 358 , which will be included in a subsequent paper .",
    "accretion signatures , like broad h@xmath2 emission and an excess in the uv or blue spectral range , are an indication for the presence of inner disk material . combined with magnetospheric accretion models ,",
    "these signatures are used to derive mass accretion rates @xcite .",
    "classical t tauri stars in taurus have average mass accretion rates of @xmath8 10@xmath23 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 ; accretion rates seem to increase with the mass of the star and also decrease over time @xcite .",
    "however , h@xmath26 emission is not necessarily correlated with the presence or absence of a disk ; several stars identified as wttss do have substantial disk masses , as derived from their millimeter emission ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or have considerable mid - ir excesses , as our sample shows . this observational fact could be explained with the presence of inner disk holes : a star with a missing inner disk might not be accreting , and thus be classified as a wtts , but still possess a prominent outer disk ( e.g. , coku tau/4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , all stars with inner disks , as inferred from their infrared excesses , are accreting and thus cttss . a few cttss ( e.g. , tw hya , gm aur ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have low near - ir excesses , but prominent mid - ir excesses , which could be an indication of grain growth in the inner disk .",
    "an extreme example is dm tau @xcite , which is an accreting t tauri star but has no near - ir excess .",
    "many , if not most , t tauri stars in taurus have companions .",
    "a list of our class ii objects belonging to multiple systems can be found in table [ tab1 ] ; many components are separated by fractions of an arcsecond , and usually they form a binary or a hierarchical quadruple system .",
    "the multiplicity of young stars adds complexity when their stellar and circumstellar properties are studied .",
    "some systems are surrounded by circumbinary disks or rings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , often in addition to a circumprimary and a circumsecondary disk .",
    "these disks can be tidally truncated @xcite ; in general , disks are found well within or outside binary orbits",
    ". therefore , the components of a binary system can be either both cttss or both wttss , especially in close ( @xmath4 a few arcseconds ) binary systems , or form a mixed pair @xcite .",
    "a circumbinary reservoir can replenish both the circumprimary and circumsecondary disk ; for wider companions , the circumprimary disk is preferentially replenished , resulting in a stronger infrared excess for the primary component @xcite . depending on the presence of material in its inner disk and thus its accretion signatures , the primary may be classified as ctts or wtts ; eventually , both components will evolve into class iii objects ( and thus wttss ) , once all the disk material has dispersed .",
    "our full sample of class ii and iii objects is listed in tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] , respectively , together with the adopted spectral type , visual extinction a@xmath27 , and t tauri star type ( ctts , wtts ) , taken from the literature ( mainly kh95 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the variability of these sources and their multiplicity ( where applicable )",
    "some measurements are quite uncertain .",
    "several spectral types are not known or are only determined with an uncertainty of a few subclasses , and ages and mass accretion rates depend on the models used to derive them , which can cause uncertainties of an order of magnitude . when derived using the same assumptions",
    ", these quantities usually agree within a factor of two .",
    "when separating the stars of our sample into cttss and wttss , we adopted the @xcite criteria for cttss , where the traditional ew[h@xmath2 ] boundary of 10  between wttss and cttss is adjusted for spectral type , with a delimiting width smaller than 10  for spectral types earlier than k7 and a larger width for spectral types later than m2.5 .    for each object with known spectral type , we checked whether the a@xmath27 value from the literature or the a@xmath27 value we derived from observed v - i colors yielded dereddened optical photometry consistent with the intrinsic colors of a main - sequence star with the same spectral type as the object under consideration . if the dereddened flux values were off , we adjusted the a@xmath27 values , usually by less than a factor of two , until a value was found that brought the observed and expected colors into agreement .",
    "several a@xmath27 values remain uncertain , but since for most taurus targets the extinction is low , changes in a@xmath27 by less than a factor of two will only minimally affect the shape of the irs spectrum and will not affect the results of our analysis .",
    "figure [ fig_classii ] shows the seds of the objects in our class ii sample , while figure [ fig_classiii ] displays those of our class iii objects .",
    "for all objects with measured extinction , their fluxes have been corrected for reddening using the object s @xmath28 from tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] and mathis s reddening law @xcite with r@xmath29 . included",
    "are photometric data points from the optical to the mid - ir mostly from kh95 , the 2mass @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 fluxes , the _ iras _ 12 , 25 , and 60 @xmath0 m fluxes , the irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m fluxes @xcite , where available , and the irs spectrum .",
    "also shown is the stellar photosphere for those objects with known spectral types ; photospheric fluxes were derived from colors of main - sequence stars given in kh95 and normalized at the j - band flux of each object with a spectral type later than g , and at the v - band flux of stars with an earlier spectral type ( ab aur , v892 tau , ry tau , and su aur ) .",
    "this normalization is based on the fact that for k and early m stars , most of the photospheric radiation is emitted around the j - band , but for earlier spectral types the peak emission shifts to shorter wavelengths . for spectral types earlier than g",
    ", the u - band would be better suited for normalization , but since u - band measurements are often poor and very sensitive to extinction , the v - band is a better choice . for f04101 + 3103 , which is of a1 spectral type , the j - band was used for normalization , since it might have an excess in the v - band .",
    "the _ iras _ data shown in the sed plots are mainly from @xcite , who used co - added _ iras _ data to determine fluxes even for faint objects ( as many class iii objects are ) , which usually fell just below the sensitivity limit of _ iras_. as can be seen in the comparison with our irs data , the fluxes for most class iii objects , as determined by @xcite , were often overestimated , resulting in mid - ir excesses for objects whose emission is actually close to photospheric over the entire infrared range . for objects not included in @xcite , such as objects with identifiers from the _ iras _ point source or faint source catalogues",
    ", we used the _ iras _ fluxes from these catalogs , mostly from the latter one .",
    "all class ii objects , even the ones defined as wttss based on the equivalent width of their h@xmath2 emission line , show a clear mid - ir excess , indicative of the presence of circumstellar disks . the majority of our class ii objects are classical t tauri stars , either single or in multiple systems ;",
    "since they show a pronounced accretion signature , indicated by their h@xmath2 emission or uv excess , it is expected that the circumstellar material in their inner disks generates a substantial infrared excess .",
    "there are only two single wttss in our class ii sample : coku tau/4 and iq tau .",
    "their seds are quite different from each other ; iq tau has a substantial excess from the near- to the mid - ir , indicating that at least the disk s inner regions ( out to a few au ) are still prominent , while coku tau/4 has no excess up to about 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "this would indicate that wtts disks are not all characterized by inner disk clearings , which is anticipated given that they are no longer accreting",
    ". however , coku tau/4 might be the only true single wtts in our sample of class ii objects ; it is a so - called transitional disk , where the inner disk has been cleared out , but a prominent outer disk is still present @xcite . even though iq tau is classified as a wtts based on its h@xmath26 equivalent width ( 7.8  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has a u - band excess , which possibly indicates that is it still accreting ( @xcite derived a mass accretion rate of @xmath33 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 , while @xcite only derived an upper limit of @xmath34 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 but noted its red k ",
    "l color ) . therefore , wttss with prominent inner disks seem to be rare , confirming previous results of a short transition time from the ctts state to a diskless wtts state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when comparing the seds of single and of multiple t tauri stars , there are no obvious systematic differences . however , since the irs spectral range is sensitive to disk emission from a few tenths to a few au from the star , we only expect to see any effects of multiplicity in close multiple systems ( @xmath4 05 , or 70 au at the distance of taurus ) .",
    "disks can surround each component or the entire multiple system ; companions will truncate both circumstellar disks ( at outer radii 0.20.5 times the semimajor axis of the binary ) and circumbinary disks ( at inner radii 23 times the semimajor axis of the binary ) , depending on the properties of the binary system @xcite . in wider systems ,",
    "inner disks are not influenced by the presence of the other components and are thus expected to have the same properties and lifetimes as disks around single stars .    for most close multiple systems ,",
    "the sed shows the combined photometry and spectrum of all components , and therefore the mid - ir flux could be generated by circumstellar dust from disks around each component or from a disk surrounding the multiple system .",
    "given that most binaries consist of ctts pairs , both components will likely contribute to the irs spectrum .    by using ground - based near - ir photometry ( k - band or , where available , l - band ) that resolved both components ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , we estimated each object s contribution to the irs spectrum ( see table [ tab1 ] ) . there is no clear correlation with binary separation : while in some close ( @xmath4 1 ) systems each component contributes roughly to equal amounts to the irs spectrum ( e.g. , gn tau ) , in some other close systems one component is the dominating one ( e.g. , v955 tau ) . in the few mixed - pair binaries of our sample , where one component is a ctts and the other a wtts ,",
    "the primary component is usually the ctts and dominates the mid - ir spectrum .",
    "therefore , the irs spectrum shows emission mostly from the circumprimary disk .",
    "this implies that the disk around the ctts is either preferentially replenished or was formed as a more massive disk ; the companion ends up with a smaller disk and a lower - mass star .",
    "this would also indicate that each system is strongly shaped by its initial conditions , i.e.  the mass of each cloud fragment that formed a binary component , its kinematics , and whether other components formed nearby .",
    "almost all of the class ii objects display pronounced 10- and 20-@xmath0 m emission features due to silicates .",
    "usually the 10-@xmath0 m feature is stronger than the 20-@xmath0 m feature , and it also varies from object to object due to different grain composition and sizes . a smooth 10-@xmath0 m feature centered around 9.8 @xmath0 m is indicative of amorphous silicates ( similar to the interstellar medium ) , while a structured 10-@xmath0 m feature ( see , e.g. , the irs spectrum of dh tau ) reveals the presence of crystalline silicates , likely processed from amorphous silicates in the circumstellar environment @xcite . in a separate paper , we explore the correlations between disk properties and the structure and strength of the 10-@xmath0 m silicate feature ( d. m. watson et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition to the almost ubiquitous presence of silicate emission features , we note the close to complete absence of pah emission features in our objects of spectral type later than about g1 , with the possible exception of ux tau a ( see section [ notes_object ] ) .",
    "pah emission is typical for the more massive counterparts of t tauri stars , the herbig ae / be stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their absence in the circumstellar environment of lower mass stars is probably a result of the weaker uv radiation field of these stars .",
    "all class iii objects in our sample have narrow h@xmath26 equivalent widths  all of them are wttss  and are not accreting within the detection limits , indicative for dispersal of their inner disks . our irs spectra support",
    "this finding : almost all class iii mid - ir spectra are photospheric . even though the dispersal of disk material would suggest that these objects are more evolved , and thus older , the ages of class iii objects do not seem to be systematically larger than those of class ii objects , which are supposedly in an earlier phase of evolution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it appears that the timescales for circumstellar disk evolution are rather determined by the initial conditions and the specific environment around a young star than set by some universal processes .",
    "young class iii objects ( @xmath4 1 - 2 myr ) apparently dispersed their circumstellar material faster than some long - lived class ii objects ; multiplicity could play a role ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but is likely not the only factor .",
    "three of our class iii objects have nearby companions with infrared excesses that partly entered the 10@xmath356 wide ll slit but not the narrower sl slit : di tau , hbc 423 , and hp tau / g2",
    ". di tau is separated by 15  from dh tau , which is a classical t tauri star ( see figure [ fig_classii ] for the sed of dh tau ) . in the case of hbc 423 , v955 tau , which is 10 away , and , to a small degree , hbc 422 , which is 26 away ,",

    "if grain growth and fragmentation both occur at the same time , grain sizes can not be used to infer the evolutionary state of a disk , i.e.  the presence of large grains in disks does not necessarily mean that a disk is older and thus more evolved .    over the last several years , it has become increasingly clear that disk models with dust settling are needed to explain the observed seds of t tauri stars : maximum grain sizes and dust - to - gas mass ratios are different for the disk interior and the disk surface , with larger grains ( @xmath4 1 mm ) close to the midplane and small , ism - like dust in the disk surface layer . to quantify the amount of dust settling",

    ", the 10-@xmath0 m feature can still be strong relative to the continuum ; it is more pronounced than the 20-@xmath0 m feature due to the wavelength - dependent emissivity of the dust .",
    "a decrease in the 10- to 20-@xmath0 m flux ratio could indicate a decrease of emission from inner disk regions relative to the outer parts , since the 10-@xmath0 m emission arises mostly from inner regions of the disk , while the main 20-@xmath0 m emission region lies further out . given",
    "that dust growth and settling is fastest in the inner parts of the disk @xcite , it is expected that the silicate emission from the inner disk would decrease first . a more detailed , quantitative study , which is beyond the scope of this paper , is required to tie our morphological sequence to disk evolution ; here",

    "then we divided the result by the width of the respective wave band , which yielded a flux density in wavelength units ( @xmath43 ) for each band . to obtain spectral indices , @xmath20",
    ", we computed @xmath44 first between 5.7 and 13.25 @xmath0 m ( @xmath45 ) , then between 13.25 and 25 @xmath0 m ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "furthermore , to quantify the properties of our morphological sequence , we used our irs spectra not corrected for reddening and calculated a spectral index covering most of the irs spectral range , from 6 to 25 @xmath0 m ( @xmath47 ) , and estimated the strength of the 10-@xmath0 m silicate feature .",
    "for the latter , we interpolated the continuum from data between 5.0 and 7.5 @xmath0 m and between 13.0 and 16.0 @xmath0 m with a third - order polynomial , subtracted it from the silicate feature defined between 8.0 and 12.4 @xmath0 m , integrated the flux of the continuum - subtracted silicate feature , and normalized it to the continuum integrated over the same wavelength range .",
    "due to uncertainties in the continuum fit , this procedure might not always yield accurate measurements of the 10-@xmath0 m silicate feature strength , but for the majority of objects it will result in reasonable estimates .",

    "a photosphere in the mid - ir has a spectral index of @xmath50 ( rayleigh - jeans limit ) , while a geometrically thin , optically thick disk has an index of @xmath51 . due to some spectrophotometric uncertainty in our irs data , the typical error bars for the spectral indices are about @xmath520.05 .",
    "the dashed boxes delineate outliers and will be discussed below .    as noted in @xcite , the fact the class ii objects in fig .",
    "[ fig_sp_index_all ] have spectral indices that are larger than the value expected for a flat , optically thick disk means that their disks must be flared .",
    "only one object in our sample , f04570 + 2520 , has an @xmath46 spectral index that is slightly smaller than that of a flat , optically thick disk ; its sed shows only a weak 10-@xmath0 m silicate feature and a steep decrease in flux beyond it , probably indicating an evolved disk in which a large fraction of the dust has grown and settled . for most objects ,",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 spectral indices seem to be correlated ; a steeper slope of the spectrum between 6 and 13 @xmath0 m is usually accompanied by a steeper slope from 13 to 25 @xmath0 m . as can be seen from the frequency distribution of both indices in figure [ fig_freq_spindex ] , the distribution peaks at values between @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath45 , and between @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath46 .",
    "while negative spectral slopes larger than @xmath57 prevail for both wavelength ranges , which is typical for class ii objects , the slope measured between 13 and 25 @xmath0 m tends to be flatter than the one measured between 6 and 13 @xmath0 m .",
    "in addition , there is a small number of objects with spectral indices @xmath46 larger than about 0.5 , which is represented by the seemingly randomly scattered points at positive @xmath46 values in figure [ fig_sp_index_all ] , and framed by dotted boxes in the figure .",
    "these  outliers \" can be divided up into three groupings : the 6 objects in the lower left box , the 4 objects in the right box , and the 4 objects in the uppermost box .",
    "the first - mentioned grouping contains dh tau , lkca 15 , ab aur , hk tau , haro 6 - 13 , and su aur .",
    "these class ii objects are characterized by a steep rise in slope starting at 13 @xmath0 m , indicating a strong 20-@xmath0 m silicate feature , and a relatively flat sed past 20 @xmath0 m .",
    "the right box frames f04101 + 3103 , mho 3 , v892 tau , and , at a negative @xmath46 value , cz tau .",
    "these objects also have a strong 20-@xmath0 m silicate feature , in addition to a pronounced 10-@xmath0 m emission feature , but their seds decrease past 20 @xmath0 m . also , their emission from 5 to 8 @xmath0 m is lower than the emission at longer wavelengths , resulting in a positive index @xmath45 .",
    "the decrease of the sed beyond about 20 @xmath0 m is especially dramatic for cz tau , which explains the low value of @xmath46 of this object .",
    "as mentioned earlier , cz tau s outer disk might be truncated , resulting in a substantial decrease of its far - ir flux .",
    "the final grouping includes the known transitional disks in taurus , coku tau/4 , gm aur , and dm tau , as well as ux tau a at @xmath58 .",
    "these `` outliers '' have negative spectral indices from 6 to 13 @xmath0 m and positive spectral indices from 13 to 25 @xmath0 m , the latter due to a steep increase in flux at about 13 @xmath0 m .",
    "also included in figure [ fig_sp_index_all ] are the spectral indices @xmath46 versus @xmath45 for those class iii objects in our sample whose 25 @xmath0 m flux was detected .",
    "however , in many cases the 25-@xmath0 m flux is very weak and the ll spectrum noisy , resulting in a larger uncertainty for the index calculation . nevertheless , most of the indices of our class iii objects are close to values of @xmath21 , as expected for close - to - photospheric fluxes .",
    "one object , v410 tau , which was not included in the plot , lies at spectral indices smaller than @xmath21 , which is mainly a result of its very noisy ll spectrum ; its irs spectrum seems to follow the slope of a photosphere , with a possible slight excess .",
    "v410 x - ray 3 lies at @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; hbc 427 and v819 tau , which have an apparent infrared excess in ll , can be found at @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "if at least part of their infrared excess is real , the latter three objects would constitute the transition phase between class ii and class iii , which seems to be very rapid due to the lack of objects with spectral indices between @xmath55 and @xmath64 .",
    "this result is similar to what is found when the k ",
    "l colors are plotted versus the k ",
    "n colors ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : there is a continuous transition between class i and ii objects , with the latter displaying bluer ir colors , but a gap between the class ii sources with the smallest infrared excess and the class iii sources , which have almost photospheric colors .",
    "we computed analogous spectral indices ( @xmath46 vs. @xmath45 ) for the grid of accretion disk models and overplotted the results from irs data and disk models in figure [ fig_spindex_models ] .",
    "we show indices computed from two sets of disk models , one with isotropic scattering of the incident stellar radiation by dust grains and the other with perfect forward scattering ( which has the same effect as no scattering , i.e.  albedo=0 ) ; they represent the two limiting cases of scattering .",
    "there is only a slight difference between these two sets ; spectral indices are not very sensitive to the degree of scattering in the models .",
    "each model set contains models computed with two mass accretion rates , 10@xmath23 and 10@xmath41 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 , which are typical for t tauri stars in taurus ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spread in the @xmath45 index is partly due to different accretion rates , but mostly an effect of varying inclination angles .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the wall emission , which dominates the flux at wavelengths shortward of about 6 @xmath0 m ; the wall emission increases as the inclination angle increases , resulting in a larger increase of the 6-@xmath0 m flux than of the 13-@xmath0 m flux , while the disk emission , which dominates at 25 @xmath0 m , decreases @xcite .",
    "the different extents of dust settling in the models , which are described by @xmath39 , cause a spread in both @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "since for mass accretion rates of 10@xmath23 and 10@xmath41 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 irradiation heating represents the main heating source @xcite , more settling causes a decrease in the mid - ir continuum emission ; the disk intercepts less radiation from the central star if its outer parts are less flared .",
    "this affects the 25-@xmath0 m flux more than the flux at shorter wavelengths , resulting in smaller spectral indices ( i.e. , steeper sed slopes ) for smaller @xmath39 .",
    "for example , aa tau , which has a mass accretion rate of 6.5@xmath10 10@xmath41 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 @xcite , lies at @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which is close to the model with an accretion rate of 10@xmath23 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 , @xmath67 , and inclination angle of 50@xmath68 .",
    "@xcite derived a lower limit for the inclination angle of aa tau of 53@xmath68 , but favored @xmath69 to explain the peculiar variability of this object .",
    "our comparison would suggest a somewhat lower inclination angle , and in addition a large amount of settling in the disk of aa tau .",
    "as another example , bp tau , which has an inclination angle of 39@xmath68 @xcite and a mass accretion rate of 1.3@xmath10 10@xmath23 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 @xcite lies at @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which is in between the model points for @xmath72 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 , @xmath67 , and inclination angles of 30@xmath68 and 40@xmath68 , respectively .",
    "most class ii objects can be described with models that include substantial settling , with an @xmath39 between 0.01 and 0.001 , which means dust depletions of factors of 100 to 1000 in the upper layers .",
    "the spectral indices for accretion disks with @xmath73 are lower than for those in which no settling has taken place , since the reduced mid - ir continuum causes a steeper slope , towards the value of @xmath51 of a flat , optically thick disk .",
    "the settling of dust does not affect the silicate emission features , which we see in virtually all of our class ii spectra ; these features are generated by the small grains still present in the upper hot layers of the disk atmosphere . as indicated earlier with a smaller sample of cttss @xcite",
    ", we conclude with this larger sample of cttss and wttss that the majority of t tauri stars have disks in which dust has started to grow and settle towards the midplane , thus affecting the seds of these young ( 12 myr ) pre - main - sequence stars .",
    "this is consistent with the simulations of @xcite , which predict dust growth on timescales of @xmath8 1 million years or less .",
    "given that all of our t tauri stars are at about the same age , the difference in the spectra of various objects must be due to different initial conditions and different circumstellar environments influenced , for example , by the presence of close companions .",
    "thus , the extent to dust settling in a disk , at least in its initial stages , might be less a function of age and more related to the object s formation history and current environment .",
    "we caution that the comparison of our data with a grid of accretion disk models is valid to gauge trends in our data , but that additional parameters , in particular the composition of the dust , need adjustments before any detailed interpretations can be carried out reliably .",
    "for example , choosing glassy pyroxene or olivine instead of `` astronomical '' silicates and graphite will generate different dust emission , both in the continuum and in the emission bands , and different spectral indices will result .",
    "therefore , the detailed composition of the dust adds additional scatter to the spectral indices plot , which has to be considered in addition to the effects of inclination and dust settling .",
    "the values we derived for @xmath39 should thus be treated as rough estimates only .",
    "the effect of dust composition on the models , as well as models of individual objects , will be presented in a future paper ( p.",

    "2006 , in preparation ) .      in order to determine a typical sed range for t tauri stars in taurus",
    ", we computed a median sed from 1.25 to 34 @xmath0 m using the 2mass j , h , and k@xmath74 photometry and the irs spectra of all our 85 class ii objects , dereddened using the a@xmath27 values listed in table [ tab2 ] . to obtain a clearer representation of the flux values in the irs spectral range",
    ", we integrated the irs spectra over narrow wave bands and divided by the width of the band , creating the equivalent of narrowband photometric measurements at 5.7 , 7.1 , 8.0 , 9.2 , 9.8 , 11.3 , 12.3 , 13.25 , 16.25 , 18.0 , 21.0 , 25.0 , 30.0 , and 34.0 @xmath0 m .",
    "the width of the bands ranged from 0.6 @xmath0 m at the shorter wavelengths to 3 @xmath0 m at the longer wavelengths ; the width of the silicate bands , centered at 9.8 and 18 @xmath0 m , was chosen to be 2 @xmath0 m . as in @xcite , we normalized all flux values at h ( 1.65 @xmath0 m ) before computing median values , since , for most objects , the h - band flux is photospheric , and thus normalization at h is equivalent to normalizing to the stellar luminosity . since for most of the t tauri stars in our sample",
    "mass accretion rates are low enough ( @xmath4 10@xmath75 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 ) that the star is the main heating source of the disk , the infrared excess of the disk should scale with stellar luminosity . by computing the median values , we also obtained the quartiles , which define the range around the median where 50% of all flux values lie .",
    "figure [ median_taurus ] shows our median with the quartiles ( indicated by the error bars ) and that obtained by @xcite .",
    "we computed the median using all 85 class ii objects in our sample ( _ upper , green data points _ ) , and by including only stars with spectral types between k5 and m2 ( _ lower , red data points _ ) .",
    "the latter data set constitutes a more homogeneous sample of stars with similar effective temperatures and allows a more direct comparison to the median from @xcite ; it is also given in table [ tab_median ] .",
    "with the irs data , we are able to resolve the silicate emission features at 10 and 20 @xmath0 m ; the median sed clearly shows that most objects have pronounced silicate emission and thus small grains in the hot upper layers of the disk atmospheres .",
    "it is remarkable that our median sed at 25 @xmath0 m almost coincides with the one from @xcite , who used _ iras",
    "_ 25 @xmath0 m flux measurements .",
    "the median sed for k5m2 stars is lower than the one for all class ii objects in our sample , as expected for a sample of stars that excludes earlier , and thus hotter , spectral types . in particular ,",
    "the decrease in the 1325 @xmath0 m range is more pronounced than that at shorter wavelengths , indicating that the silicate feature at 20 @xmath0 m decreases more than the 10-@xmath0 m silicate feature for late spectral types .",
    "figure [ median_taurus_models ] displays the irs median sed for spectral types",
    "k5m2 ( _ red _ ) , the median computed from irac data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ purple _ ) , and the photospheric component ( _ dotted line _ ) , represented by the sed of the wtts hbc 427 @xcite .",
    "we compare these to seds of two irradiated accretion disk models with different degrees of dust settling .",
    "the photospheric component is normalized at j , while all the other seds are normalized at h.    the models shown in figure [ median_taurus_models ] were constructed according to the methods of @xcite and are described in section [ settling_models ] , with a few differences : accretion shock irradiation is included as heating mechanism for the disk ( but it does not make a significant difference for @xmath76 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 ) , and the dust mixture consists of spherical particles of amorphous pyroxene ( glassy @xmath77 , optical constants from * ? ? ? * ) and graphite ( optical constants from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this dust composition results in higher silicate emission at 10 and 20 @xmath0 m and therefore is a better fit for the taurus median sed ( see also discussion in @xmath5 [ irs_sp_indices_models ] ) .",
    "the models were computed for an inclination angle of 60@xmath68 , a mass accretion rate of @xmath78 m@xmath24 yr@xmath25 , and two values of the settling parameter @xmath39 , 0.1 and 0.001 .",
    "comparison of the models with the median and quartiles suggests large degrees of depletion in the upper layers of disks in taurus : about 50% of the disks have a dust depletion larger than a factor of 1000 ( @xmath79 ) , while about 25% of the disks can be characterized with degrees of depletion between a factor of 10 and 1000 .",
    "only about 25% of the disks have between a factor of 10 and no depletion of dust in the upper disk layers .",
    "we estimated upper limits for the mass of small , warm dust grains ( size @xmath4 10 @xmath0 m , temperature @xmath9 100 k ) in the disks around the 26 class iii objects we observed , assuming optically thin dust emission from `` astronomical '' silicates ( optical constants from * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since none of the class iii objects considered here show silicate emission bands at 10 or 20 @xmath0 m , larger grains ( @xmath9 34 @xmath0 m ) , if any , must be present in their disks ; for this reason we included only grains between sizes of 3 and 10 @xmath0 m ( the mid - infrared is not sensitive to emission from larger particles ) .",
    "first , we calculated the equilibrium temperature for each grain size at a distance @xmath80 from the star by solving the following equation numerically : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the stellar radius , @xmath83 is the absorption efficiency , and @xmath84 is the planck function , evaluated at the stellar effective temperature @xmath85 and at the dust grain temperature @xmath86 , respectively . assuming that the disk is axially symmetric and geometrically thin , we parametrized the optical depth as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the reference surface number density of dust grains of size @xmath89 at a distance @xmath90 from the star ; this column density varies with radius as @xmath91 , and the grain size distribution varies as @xmath92 .",
    "we chose @xmath93  au , @xmath94  @xmath95 m , and , besides for a few exceptions , @xmath96 .",
    "the flux emitted from the disk at each wavelength is obtained by integrating over annuli and summing over each dust grain size : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is defined in equation ( [ equ_tau ] ) , @xmath99 is obtained from equation ( [ equ_temp ] ) , and @xmath100 is the distance to the star , assumed to be 140 pc , the distance to the taurus star - forming region .",
    "the total dust mass in the disk is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the mass of a single dust grain . to obtain upper limits for the dust masses in our class iii objects , we adjusted the parameter @xmath88 ( and in some cases also @xmath103 ) , until the disk emission from equation ( [ equ_flux ] ) matched the emission of each class iii object after photosphere subtraction .",
    "the photospheres are represented by ames - dusty models of @xcite for effective temperatures up to 5000 k ; for hotter stars , we approximated the photospheres by blackbodies in the rayleigh - jeans limit .",
    "we integrated the flux from 0.1 to 50 au and summed over 11 grain sizes from 3 to 10 @xmath0 m radius .",
    "with all the assumptions mentioned above , our model fits result in typical upper limits for warm , small dust grains in any circumstellar disks around our class iii objects of a few times 10@xmath104 lunar masses . assuming that the infrared excess of hbc 427 and v819 tau can be fully attributed to disks around these objects ,",
    "the maximum amount of dust mass in these disks would amount to a few times 10@xmath105 lunar masses .",
    "in addition , since their excess starts rather abruptly at 14 @xmath0 m , their disks would require inner holes of a few au in size to explain the lack of shorter - wavelength excess emission .",
    "hp tau / g2 seems to already have a slight excess shortward of 14 @xmath0 m ; again assuming all the excess emission originates in a disk around this object , the upper limit to the dust mass would amount to somewhat less than 10@xmath104 lunar masses .",
    "a dust mass of a few times 10@xmath104 lunar masses is comparable to that found around debris disks @xcite , although closer to the lower mass values .",
    "the multi - wavelength seds , which weight the spectrum in terms of the relative power emitted at each wavelength , provide an immediate initial estimate of the relative luminosities of the star and the disk . in most cases ,",
    "the luminosity of the disk is less than that of the star because most of the disk heating and thus disk emission are due to absorption and reprocessing of stellar radiation .",
    "however , of the 85 class ii systems shown in figure [ fig_classii ] , xz tau , uy aur , hn tau , fs tau , 04187 + 1927 , 04200 + 2759 , dg tau , and dp tau appear to have anomalously large irs excesses relative to the central star .",
    "as noted in section [ notes_object ] , a few of these objects have envelopes ; uy aur has an ir companion separated by 09 from the primary and likely seen through the disk of the primary , given its larger reddening @xcite .",
    "together with the other @xmath106 objects with very high and therefore uncertain @xmath28 mentioned in section [ notes_object ] , there might be about 17 candidates for edge - on disks .",
    "in addition , hk tau b @xcite and likely also aa tau @xcite have edge - on disks , bringing the total of t tauri stars likely seen at an inclination angle close to 90 to 19 .",
    "thus , 22% of the class ii objects in our sample ( or 17% of the t tauri stars of our taurus sample ) are likely seen edge - on , which is roughly what is expected from statistical considerations for objects with inclinations between 77 and 90 .",
    "in addition , these objects do not show any deep silicate absorption features , as expected from models @xcite ; therefore , either these highly inclined disks are not massive enough , or we are observing the 10-@xmath0 m thermal emission from the inner disk , scattered by the dust in the outer disk atmosphere ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a few of our class ii objects show a decrease or lack of ir excess at shorter irs wavelengths , indicative of inner disk clearings or gaps .",
    "some of these sources ( gm aur , dm tau , coku tau/4 ) have been described as transition disks and are the subject of other papers @xcite .",
    "only 4% of the class ii objects in our sample , or 3% of the 111 t tauri stars we observed in taurus , are in this transitional disk phase , which would indicate that this stage is short - lived .",
    "if their longer - wavelength excess proves to be real , hbc 427 , v819 tau , and possibly also v410 x - ray 3 , could also be considered as objects in transition , even though their excess emission is so weak that it is probably not optically thick disk emission .",
    "on the other hand , they might be regarded as debris disks , where dust is generated by collisions of larger bodies and is optically thin at all wavelengths .",
    "if that were the case , they would be among the youngest debris disks discovered so far .",
    "ux tau a has a very peculiar spectrum , with significant excess at shorter wavelengths , but a sharp transition at 20 @xmath0 m .",
    "even though it is a multiple system , the other components are at distances that are unlikely to affect the inner disk we are observing with the irs .",
    "also , their flux contribution in the mid - ir is expected to be small .",
    "thus , the irs spectrum of ux tau a suggests that it might be in a pre - transition state , when most dust in the inner disk has already settled and grown , and thus the lifetime of the inner disk is coming to an end .",
    "other objects that could be in a pre - transition state are 04385 + 2550 , haro 6 - 13 , hk tau , and lkca 15 ; their 20-@xmath0 m silicate feature is stronger or comparable to the 10-@xmath0 m feature , reminiscent of transitional disks , but they have substantial excess emission in the near - ir . in these objects ,",
    "a gap might be opening , but a significant inner disk is still present .",
    "we presented the mid - infrared spectra of 85 class ii and 26 class iii objects in taurus , obtained with the infrared spectrograph on board the _ spitzer space telescope_. this large sample of pre - main - sequence stars of similar age , belonging to the same star - forming region , allows us to draw the following conclusions about circumstellar disk evolution :    @xmath107 all cttss and some wttss display mid - ir excesses , which are generated in the inner ( a few tenths to a few au ) parts of circumstellar disks .",
    "accretion signatures like the h@xmath2 equivalent line width do not necessarily indicate the presence or absence of disks , but they usually reveal whether the innermost disk regions are still present .",
    "while accreting t tauri stars have dusty disks extending from the dust sublimation radius outward and thus generate excess emission starting at near - ir wavelengths , wttss often have inner disk holes and thus lack near - ir excess emission . since there are few wttss with disks , the transition period between an active ( i.e. , accreting ) and a passive ( i.e. , purely reprocessing ) disk stage seems short - lived .",
    "@xmath107 the details of the mid - ir excess , and thus the distribution and properties of the dust in circumstellar disks , do not seem to be correlated with the multiplicity of the young star system . a sub - arcsecond ( @xmath4 140 au at the distance of taurus ) companion does not necessarily influence the inner disk ; even spectroscopic binaries , like dq tau , seem to have substantial inner disks .",
    "we note that our irs spectra can not separate the contribution of close multiple systems , and therefore , in some cases , they show the combined mid - ir spectrum of circumprimary , circumsecondary , and circumbinary disk .",
    "the mid - ir spectra of multiple systems do not have any peculiarities that would set them apart from single stars ; this could be explained if most disks in these systems are not influenced by the presence of companions and either the circumprimary disk clearly dominates the system or all components have similar disks , or if a circumbinary disk mimicked the behavior of a circumstellar disk around a single star .",
    "@xmath107 almost all class ii objects show 10- and 20-@xmath0 m silicate emission features in their mid - ir spectra , generated in the optically thin disk surface layer .",
    "there is a wide variety of feature strengths and crystallinity , independent of the spectral type and multiplicity of the objects .",
    "however , objects with weak 10-@xmath0 m silicate features usually have a decreasing sed in the mid - ir range , which could be an indication of dust growth and settling . in objects where the 10- and 20-@xmath0 m features are suppressed , dust grains must exceed radii of about 4 @xmath0 m .",
    "@xmath107 after comparing the spectral indices @xmath108 between 6 and 13 @xmath0 m and between 13 and 25 @xmath0 m of our class ii objects with accretion disk models that include dust settling , we infer that our data are consistent with these models . within the assumptions of the adopted models ,",
    "most t tauri stars seem to have experienced substantial dust settling ( and likely also dust growth ) , with depletions of factors of about 1001000 of the standard dust - to - gas mass ratio in the disk atmosphere .",
    "thus , we are able to estimate the amount of dust settling for a large sample of t tauri stars , using the high sensitivity and spectral coverage of the irs",
    ". this result will aid in the refinement of models predicting the evolution of dust in protoplanetary disks .",
    "@xmath107 most wttss in our sample are class iii objects , which have nearly photospheric fluxes in the infrared , indicating a dispersal of dust in their circumstellar disks .",
    "the upper limit for the mass of small , warm dust grains in these disks lies around 10@xmath104 lunar masses , which is similar to the dust mass of low - mass debris disks . in some cases nearby companions ( @xmath8 10 ) , which seem to have an infrared excess , contaminated the ll part of our class iii sources",
    "it is interesting that objects of roughly the same age , formed in close proximity to each other , do evolve on different time scales .",
    "this result , as well as the diversity in mid - ir spectra observed for our class ii objects , indicates that age does not seem to be the dominating factor determining disk evolution , but rather the initial conditions of the star - forming core , like its mass and angular momentum .",
    "while there likely is an evolutionary sequence from a classical t tauri star with an accretion disk to a weak - lined t tauri star with a passive disk to a t tauri star with little or no disk left , there does not seem to be an absolute , evolutionary timescale regulating when the transitions from one stage to the next occur .",
    "therefore , we can witness circumstellar disk evolution in young star - forming regions such as taurus and infer the major steps in the process by analyzing a large sample of pre - main - sequence stars ; this paper is a contribution to this effort by presenting and analyzing unprecedented data from the _ spitzer space telescope_.    we thank our anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions .",
