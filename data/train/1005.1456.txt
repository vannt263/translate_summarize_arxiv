    "although the phenomenon of nuclear fission has been discovered since about sixty years back , many crucial facets of this process are still not understood at fundamental level , warranting further exploration of its dynamics .",
    "this is more so when viewed from the microscopic theoretical point of view .",
    "from the early days , the two goals of nuclear theory were to explain the fission phenomena and the working of the nuclear independent - particle shell model in terms of the nuclear hamiltonian involving nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "although the later goal is more or less reached , the former is still languishing in the mid way .",
    "the general methods followed in such studies are nonrelativistic selfconsistent mean - field theories like hartree - fock ( hf ) , hartree - fock bogolybuv(hfb ) , hartree - bcs etc . and their derivatives .",
    "these theories are more suitable for finding the static fission path @xcite , however they can be used to exhaustively map the entire potential energy landscape spanned by relevant degrees of freedom revealing main features of fission dynamics . in an improved microscopic calculation fission",
    "is described by performing the time evolution of a single determinantal many - body wave function in the framework of time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory @xcite .",
    "such attempts imposing restrictive constraints , have been done with limited success .",
    "the proper microscopic theory for fission is the adiabatic time - dependent hartree - fock ( atdhf ) developed by villars and others @xcite to deal with effectively the large amplitude slow evolution of the nuclear shape in this process . in this theory",
    ", one can calculate the dynamic fission path without computing the entire energy landscape .",
    "however the practical application to date has been rather very limited @xcite primarily because of its complexity . in a recent development a new microscope approach based on time dependent generator coordinate method ( tdgcm ) has been proposed @xcite using solutions of hartree - fock bogolyubov mean field theory and gaussian overlap approximation .",
    "the theory is equipped to describe the time - dependent evolution of the fission process whose initial applications look promising .",
    "the most popular and widely used microscopic - macroscopic method @xcite is semi - microscopic in nature , consisting of a liquid drop part and a shell correction part for the total energy of the nucleus . the exploration of the multidimensional energy landscape has been quite successful in this method @xcite . in such approach , specifically introducing neck degree of freedom and using two - centre microscopic potential to favour the formation of two fragments , studies @xcite have been made to investigate specific questions like how neck influences the fission paths and emission of scission neutrons etc .",
    "here we have entertained a specific objective of studying the neck configuration following the static fission path at a fundamental level using microscopic nuclear many - body hamiltinian , with the hope of unraveling some core features of fission dynamics , for which we have adopted the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory .",
    "the critical feature of the fission phenomena is the multiplicity of neutron emitted in this process , which plays key role in the chain reaction leading to energy generation . in the commonly used thermal fission of @xmath10 ,",
    "the multiplicity of the neutron is 2.5 , emitted by the two fragments in the post scission stage after they are accelerated by the mutual coulomb repulsion . in this reaction ,",
    "the neck is believed to be neutron rich as the neutron emission from this region have been observed @xcite to be more than that of the @xmath11- particle and the proton emission . experimentally it may not be possible to ascertain the true composition of the neck , which has potential to reveal important aspects of the mechanism of fission dynamics .",
    "it will be truly rewarding if it would be possible to generate theoretically the neck , and find neutron - proton composition in a quantitative manner .",
    "such study will open up the possibility for understanding the fission of highly neutron - rich actinide nuclei , likely to be synthesised in the rib fascilities under construction in many laboratories around the world @xcite .",
    "how does such a nucleus undergo fission is a very pertinent question with potential to be an exciting theme of research in future .",
    "the composition of neck in the fission of such nuclei may contain informations regarding new physics .",
    "various mass formulae have predicted that uranium isotope with mass number as high as 270 and even more upto 290 to be particle stable .",
    "the progressive production of such nuclei in the r - process of nuclear synthesis in stellar evolution is more real than speculative .",
    "the continued synthesis of successively heavier isotopes of an element by neutron capture in this process is finally terminated by fission . in an earlier study @xcite , we have identified a valley where uranium and thorium isotopes with neutron number in the range n=154 - 172 to be thermally fissile , a reflection of the close shell structure of n= 162 @xmath12 predicted in numerous calculations over the years . therefore in our calculation we have included , besides the two well known stable nuclei @xmath13th and @xmath14u the exotic nuclei @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath8u , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath9th far from this stability valley .    a more exciting impetus to study",
    "the above nuclei originates from the expectation to find new phenomena in this virgin nuclear territory of high neutron to proton ratio , widely speculated to be manifested . the maximum neutron to proton ratio of neck found to be about 5 for the heaviest isotopes @xmath8u and @xmath9th considered here .",
    "the heavier isotopes than these ones will not support neck suggestive of the break down of the liquid drop picture .",
    "our recent study @xcite of @xmath15u gives strong evidence of new mode of fission decay termed as multifragmentation fission in which 2.5 neutrons are emitted at scission along with the two fragments , in addition to the usual 2.5 prompt neutrons in the post scission stage .",
    "the present study of the composition of the neck configuration has the potential to be a precursor of such a phenomenon and even of some more exotic ones . in sec.2 ,",
    "we present an outline of our scheme of calculation in the rmf theory.the calculations and results are given in sec.3 , and discussions in sec.4 . sec .",
    "5 contains the conclusion .",
    "a brief sketch of the rmf theory @xcite is outlined here for completeness .",
    "the relativistic lagrangian density for a nucleon - meson many - body system is given by    @xmath16    from this lagrangian we obtain the field equations for the nucleons and mesons .",
    "these equations are solved by expanding the upper and lower components of the dirac spinors and the boson fields in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the set of coupled equations is solved numerically by a self - consistent iteration method .",
    "here we get bosonic equation for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons and dirac equation for the nucleons .",
    "the @xmath17- field gives the attractive and the @xmath18- field gives the repulsive component of the nuclear potential .",
    "however , the @xmath19 meson field takes care of the proton - neutron asymmetric energy . in our calculation , the constant gap bcs pairing is used to add the pairing effects for open shell nuclei . the centre - of - mass motion ( c.m . )",
    "energy correction is estimated by the usual harmonic oscillator formula @xmath20 .    in the present investigation ,",
    "we have carried out study microscopically in the nonlinear rmf theory of boguta and bodmer @xcite , an extended version of walecka @xcite theory .",
    "we have adopted the nl3 @xcite interactions .",
    "the nl3 interaction has been widely used in recent years in the calculation of varieties of nuclear properties like binding energy , _ rms _ radii and giant resonances etc . and have been accepted to be very successful .",
    "here we have studied the stability of our result for each nucleus by varying the number of harmonic oscillator shells used in the basis between @xmath21 to 28 .",
    "the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath22 is evaluated from the resulting proton and neutron quadrupole moments , as @xmath23 .",
    "matter radius is defined as @xmath24 ; here @xmath25 is the mass number , and @xmath26 is the deformed density . as outputs , we obtain different potentials , densities , single - particle energy levels , radii , quadrupole deformations and the binding energies . for a given nucleus",
    ", the maximum binding energy corresponds to the ground - state and other solutions are obtained as various excited intrinsic states , provided the nucleus does not under go fission .",
    "the density distribution of nucleons plays the prominent role in the study of the internal structure of a nucleus . when the deformation of a nucleus is varied , the density distribution @xmath27 inside the nucleus also varies .",
    "for example , the @xmath27 for a spherical nucleus is symmetrical in @xmath28plane .",
    "however , it is highly asymmetric for a largely deformed nucleus . knowing the density distribution of the spherical or ( oblate/ prolate ) deformed configuration",
    ", we can calculate the number of nucleons for each configuration , defined as @xmath29 @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the neutron and proton density of the nucleus , and the the total density @xmath33 .",
    "we have obtained the static fission path by calculating the potential energy surface ( pes ) using the above rmf formalism in a constrained calculation @xcite , i.e. , instead of minimizing the @xmath34 , we have minimized @xmath35 , with @xmath36 as a lagrange multiplier and @xmath37 , the quadrupole moment .",
    "thus , we get the solution at a given quadrupole deformation and then obtain the energy using the @xmath34 .",
    "the fission process has been traditionally visualized in liquid - drop picture , where the nuclear surface is expressed in terms of collective deformation parameters characterized by several multipole shapes with quadrupole deformation playing the most important role .",
    "classically , it corresponds to slow movement of the nucleus from the ground state equilibrium shape along a slowly rising valley path in the energy landscape spanned by the deformation variables .",
    "it reaches the barrier top ( saddle point ) , and then slides down on the outer surface of the barrier and acquires a highly elongated shape culminating in a narrow neck which finally splits into two fragment nuclei .",
    "quantum mechanically this path upto the scission point defines a potential barrier , which can be used for calculating the transmission coefficient to obtain the fission probability .",
    "it is this path normally called static fission path , which we intend to calculate here . since quadrupole deformation plays the predominant role , we have chosen it in our calculation and ignored the other deformation coordinates for simplicity , being guided by the goal for studying the anatomy of neck configurations exhaustively .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a nucleus undergoes binary fission in various modes with different probabilities .",
    "the neck configuration in each mode is likely to be different from those of the other modes depending upon the respective pairs of fragment nuclei .",
    "therefore , the necks for the symmetric and asymmetric configurations will be different , and so also their scission points .    in our calculations",
    "we have imposed time reversal symmetry , reflection symmetry across xy plane and rotational symmetry about the z - direction , i , e , the fission direction . so naturally we arrive at symmetric fission .",
    "mller et al.@xcite have found two different paths leading to symmetric and asymmetric fission in their study in five - dimensional deformation space .",
    "we did not get solution for the configuration with two separated fragments in our calculations , which may be attributed to the limitation of the numerical computation / mean field theory .    in table 1 , we have presented our results on the energy , deformation , rms radius of the ground - state and neck configuration of the two known nuclei @xmath14u and @xmath13th in the valley of stability and the six exotic neutron - rich nuclei @xmath15u , @xmath9u , @xmath8u , @xmath38th , @xmath15th and @xmath9th away from it . to begin with it will be interesting and reassuring to see how well the ground - state properties of these two known nuclei are reproduced in our calculation .",
    "the experimental values of these properties are presented in parenthesis below the corresponding theoretical values in the same table .",
    "it can be seen that the ground - state energy , the deformation and rms radius of these two nuclei compare remarkably well with experiment .",
    "this reassures us about the goodness of the interaction and the suitability of the rmf theory for this study .    in the next step ,",
    "we calculate the static fission - path and examine if the general fission properties like the barrier and its double - humped characteristics are reproduced .",
    "although we have performed startic path calculation for all the eight nuclei we present here only the results of the widely studied nucleus @xmath14u , and one of the exotic nuclei , i.e. , @xmath15u . in fig",
    "1 we have plotted the energy as a function of the deformation parameter for these two nuclei . from the figure , it can be seen that the fission barrier for @xmath14u comes out to be 6.95 mev comparable to the experimental value of 5.75 mev @xcite .",
    "the fission barrier of 4.05 mev in case of @xmath15u obtained in our calculation , is expectedly lower than that of @xmath14u which agrees with the howard - mller value of 4.3 mev .",
    "the double - humped fission barriers in both cases have been reproduced .",
    "these results are indeed very satisfying .",
    "we have followed the density profile of the evolving fragments along with the neck , to findout a criterion for the delineation of the latter .",
    "we observe in general that , this profile has the form of a fermi distribution in the fragment region as expected , with the tail part attaining a constant value .",
    "we have chosen the criterion that when the density falls to @xmath39 of the central density and remains constant along the z - coordinate , then neck is assumed to originate which merges on the other fragment with the endpoint being defined with similar criterion .",
    "we have presented in fig .",
    "2 , the matter density distributions of some typical configurations these two nuclei acquire , in their static fission - path right upto the neck configuration .",
    "it is satisfying to see well defined dumbbell shape of neck reproduced in rmf study as solution of microscopic nuclear many - body hamiltonian , in agreement with age - old picture of fission process envisioned in classical liquid drop model .",
    "the physical characteristics of the necks of these systems emerging from this study will be discussed along which the other six nuclei aposteriori . in a recent microscopic study using constrained hfb method with gogny interaction dubray et al @xcite , obtained very elongated shape without clear - cut neck before the scission in th and fm isotopes , and found that these fissioning systems energetically favoured splitting into two separate fragments rather than develop an elongated shape with a neck .",
    "banneau @xcite obtained similar results for fm isotope in his study using skyrme - hartree - fock - bcs model .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table 1 ]    we have estimated the number of neutrons and protons contained in the neck by using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which are presented in table 2 . as we move from @xmath0 to @xmath4 , the number of neck neutrons increases from 2.42 to 5.11 and the proton number almost does not change .",
    "similar trend is seen for th isotopes with rise from 1.71 for @xmath13th to 3.78 for @xmath9th .",
    "it may be observed that the value of @xmath40 is some what different from that of @xmath41 in table 2 , because the effective volumes for neutron and proton distributions are different , the latter being somewhat smaller than the former due to its considerable low number .",
    "this high neutron - proton ratio is a precursor of a new mode of fission decay which will be discussed aposteriori .",
    "the maximum ratio of neutron to proton in the neck found by us is around 5 for the heaviest isotopes @xmath8u and @xmath9th considered by us .",
    "quasi - bound / resonance for @xmath42h , @xmath43h have been known ; no such states for heavier isotope of hydrogen above @xmath44h have been observed .",
    "neck can be considered a quasi - bound transient state .",
    "thus our finding of the maximum n / z ratio in the neck correlates with these transient states observed in nature .",
    "the nuclear matter inhabiting the neck region in the heaviest isotope @xmath8u considered here has the neutron to proton ratio about 5:1 which corresponds to @xmath44h system .",
    "since @xmath45h system is the likely limiting surviving resonance with half - life of @xmath46 sec .",
    "only and resonances of still heavier hydrogen isotopes are unlikely to be found in nature , it is reasonable to conclude that such nuclear liquid is not viable . therefore neck formation in somewhat heavier than @xmath8u isotope requiring such nuclear liquid with higher neutron to proton ratio than 6:1 will be unsustainable , which signals break - down of the usual liquid - drop picture of the fission process visualized so far .",
    "since neck can not be formed as the nuclear liquid - drop picture breaks down and so fission will be inhibited in such heavy neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "this effect is also manifested in progressive shrinking of the elongation of the neck with rise of neutron number in heavier isotopes ( see table 2 ) which may eventually disappear with increase of mass .",
    "thus the predominant mode of decay of such nuclei will be @xmath47decay .",
    "the situation seems parallel to the case of superheavy element in the valley of stability where @xmath48decay becomes more preferred mode of decay over fission .",
    "how far the nucleus extends in its neck configuration compared to its size in its ground - state ? in table 2 , we have presented the charge radius of the neck configuration @xmath49 , length of the neck @xmath50 , i.e. the distance between the two facing surfaces connected by the neck , @xmath51 the distance between the centre of the two fragments and @xmath52 the distance between the two tips which is a measure of the extension .",
    "the charge radii of the neck for all the isotopes are around 12 fm ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the length of the neck @xmath50 is around 5 fm for the two nuclei @xmath14u and @xmath13th .",
    "the value decreases with the rise of the neutron number reaching 4.29 fm for @xmath8u and 4.52 fm for @xmath9th .",
    "less elongated neck for heavier isotopes is a reflection of the fact that , decrease of binding energy due to increase of neutron to proton ratio , does not support a longer configuration but a shorter one .",
    "the tip to tip distance @xmath53 is around 37 fm in all the cases .",
    "thus , well defined neck and fairly extended mass distribution in this configuration is evident in all cases .",
    "it is indeed interesting to find , very heavy nuclei acquiring such extended dumbell configuration supported by nucleon - nucleon force .",
    "it is useful to recall here that light 4n nuclei like @xmath54o , @xmath55ne , @xmath56 mg , @xmath57si etc .",
    "exhibit very long physical states with linear @xmath48cluster configuration@xcite .",
    "since neck is the most sensitive part where rupture takes place giving rise to two heavy fission fragments , its composition will play a crucial role in determining the fission dynamics . in widely studied @xmath14u ,",
    "the decay process is binary ; at the instant of the rupture of the neck , each of two protruding parts originating from the rupture of the neck is sucked in by the respective connecting fragments .",
    "then the two fragments move in opposite direction , being repelled by the mutual coulomb repulsion , and emit 2.5 neutrons in the process of de - excitation to the respective ground - states .",
    "the sucking of the half of the neck by a fragment is possible because of the presence of sizable number of protons ( as shown in the present calculations ) in the neck providing attractive nuclear force .",
    "however in the heavier isotopes like @xmath15th , @xmath9th , @xmath15u , @xmath9u and @xmath8u the proton components are relatively smaller compared to the neutron components .",
    "the likely scenario in such a system is that the triplet - triplet and singlet - singlet components of nucleon - nucleon force which are repulsive in nature become dominant , and therefore sucking in is unlikely to happen , and the ruptured neck may not be able to hold on all the neutrons , and may simultaneously release them along with the production of the two fragments .",
    "this will be a new mode of fission decay as mentioned in the introduction known as _",
    "multifragmentation fission _ proposed earlier by the authors @xcite . in such cases , the multiplicity of neutron will consist of two parts : the usual prompt neutrons plus the multifragmentation neutrons generated at the time of scission contributed by the neck . taking into account the neck neutrons calculated above , and assuming the modest value of 2.5 for prompt neutrons similar to that of @xmath14u , the multiplicity are expected to be more than 4 for @xmath15u , @xmath9u , @xmath8u , @xmath15th and @xmath9th .",
    "this prediction will get strong support from the probability of fragment mass - yield as shown below .",
    "the important driving force for the decay of a nucleus is the q - value of the reaction .",
    "the probability of fragment mass - yield in fission process is directly related to the q - value and temperature at the scission point .",
    "we therefore calculate the q - value systematics of the fission of the nucleus ( a , z ) decaying to ( @xmath58 ) and ( @xmath59 ) defined as : @xmath60    to avoid clumsiness we have plotted the q - values in fig . 5 for the 6 isotopes @xmath61u and @xmath62th for the possible binary decays ( a , z)= ( @xmath58)+ ( @xmath59 ) taking even values of @xmath63 in the range 39 to 46 , with varying @xmath64 , the complementary fragment ( @xmath59 ) being thereby fixed . since the yield falls rapidly with the decrease of the q - value for an element , the values lying above 90% of the heighest value are only relevant .    for the present study we have used the masses predicted in the finite range droplet model ( frdm ) @xcite and infinite nuclear mass model ( inm ) @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the latter mass model for its unique success in describing the saturation properties @xcite of inm , shell quenching @xcite in the large neutron n=82 , 126 shells and its long range predictive ability especially in the neutron rich side .",
    "for each element the two vertical lines in the figures refer to the drip - lines predicted in the two mass models which agree within @xmath65 neurons . except for the three isotopes @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath38th in the valley of stability , in the remaining five caces , the drip - lines fall within the q - value distributions with a few touching the outer fringes . to avoid clumsyness",
    "we depict in fig .",
    "5 the cases of 6 isotopes only .",
    "all the isotopes lying to the right of the drip - line will be unstable against the instantaneous release of the neutrons from the fragments at the scission . in the usual fission process of @xmath0 , neutrons are emitted from the fragments after they are accelerated .",
    "but the five cases of heavy isotopes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 a certain number of neutrons will be simultaneously emitted along with the two heavy fragments .",
    "it will be interesting to see if the number of multifragmentation neutrons which can be estimated taking the drip - line nucleus as the last surviving fragment , and compare the same with the number of neutrons in the neck .",
    "it is expected that there will be a correlation between the number of neck neutrons and the multifragmentation neutrons which will be emitted by the fragments being populated beyond drip - line at scission .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose the excess of neutrons beyond the drip - line are likely to lodged in the neck . from the @xmath66value distributions of",
    "@xmath8u it can be seen that about 5 multifragmentation neutrons will be emitted ( ignoring the one or two units of neutron difference between predictions of the two mass formulae ) in most of the decay modes which agree with the neutron number in the neck ( see table 2 ) . in the case of @xmath9th",
    "the corresponding number is about 4 neutrons .",
    "thus in the fission process of exotic neutron - rich isotopes , the picture emerges that , the neutrons beyond the drip - line contained in the fission fragments are likely to take part in the neck formation .",
    "it is interesting to see that there is a qualitative agreement .",
    "it must be recognised that these scission neutrons are the extra neutrons in addition to the normal multiplicity of neutrons emitted from the fragments .",
    "thus the total multiplicity will be more than doubled .",
    "it will have serious implication in the chain reaction , the key process for energy generation in fission .",
    "we would like to imphasize that although at the moment this new decay mode of fission may not be realised in the laboratory , it is very likely occurring in the r - process nucleosynthesis of terrestrial evolution .     and @xmath2 as a function of the deformation parameter @xmath22 obtained in the relativistic mean field formalism with nl3 parameter set . ]     of @xmath14u and @xmath1 obtained in the relativistic mean field formalism using nl3 parameter set .",

    "is taken from @xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite for frdm and inm , respectively .",
    "the fission yield decreases drastically with increase or decrease of mass number of given element .",
    "therefore , we have shown the distribution in the range 90 to 100@xmath71 of the peak value in each case .",
    "the vertical line marks the neutron drip - line for the corresponding element in each panel .",
    "the full and dashed line denote the calculations with frdm and inm mass models respectively . ]",
    "we have attempted to understand the mechanism of fission decay by following the static fission path , and concentrating on the ultimate shape of the nucleus it likely to acquire , before the break up , i.e. , the neck configuration .",
    "this picture envisaged since the very early days of nuclear physics viewing the nucleus to be a classical liquid , is reafirmed here in a microscopic study carried out in the framework of established nuclear theory employing welknown many - body nuclear hamiltonian . the rmf theory which has gained the confidence of nuclear communities as",
    "a viable theory has been adopted in the present study . in our calculation , it has been possible to access such highly deformed configuration as neck by using very large basis consisting of as many as 28 oscillator states , while for ground - state 10 or 12 states are adequate .",
    "this study has bared the anatomy of neck , revealing rich neutron - proton ratio , which progressively increases with the neutron number in the isotope .",
    "we have been able to find out the length of the neck and its neutron - proton composition in term of their numbers .",
    "the maximum neutron to proton ratio found by us is 5 which may correlate with the quasi - bound / resonance state of the heaviest hydrogen isotope @xmath44h known so far .",
    "this neck with higher neutron to proton ratio then 6 are not likely to be formed .",
    "this suggests that heavier isotopes of uranium than @xmath8u may undergo fission without formation of neck or more likely fission is inhibited .",
    "this may be a new feature of fission to be found in ultra - neutron - rich uranium isotopes which signals the breakdown of liquid - drop picture .    in our investigation",
    ", besides the welknown actinide nuclei @xmath14u and @xmath13th in the valley of stability , their highly neutron - rich isotopes @xmath15u , @xmath9u , @xmath8u , @xmath38th , @xmath15th , @xmath9th have been included with the objective of finding the fission properties of such exotic nuclei of relevance in stellar evolution .",
    "some of these nuclei with lower mass number are likely to be synthesised in the rib facilities .",
    "the highly neutron - rich necks found in the calculation in the above exotic nuclei , points out a new mode of fission decay where along with the two heavy fragments some neutrons will be emitted simultaneously at scission .",
    "these are extra neutrons in addition to the usual neutron multiplicity emitted by the two fragments later in the flight .",
    "thus total multiplicity gets more than doubled of the expected usual one . due to extreme neutron - richness of the neck it can not be sucked into the two fragments at scission , but itself breaks down contributing these neutrons .",
    "this inference is supported by our fission mass - yield study carried out using q - value systematics .",
    "it will have serious implication in the energy generation process in the r - process nucleosynthesis in stellar evolution .",
    "whether this process will be of any utility in the laboratory is too premature to speculate at the moment .",
