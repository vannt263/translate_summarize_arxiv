    "holography is motivated by black hole thermodynamics , which suggests that emergence of gravity can be associated with coarse - graining a la classical thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "we then seek to understand what is being coarse - grained , and how .    a crucial hint is provided by the fact that ads / cft geometrizes quantum entanglement : entanglement entropy ( ee ) in the cft is given by the area of a certain extremal surface in the bulk @xcite .",
    "indeed , the fascinating idea of spacetime geometry being the encoder of the entanglement structure of the quantum state @xcite hints at potentially deep insights into the workings of quantum gravity .    as a first step , we would like to decipher the dynamical equations of gravity from the these statements . in this regard , ee which motivates",

    ", width=192 ]    inspired by this logic , we propose to study a qft quantity we call _ entanglement density_. this effectively measures two - body quantum entanglement between two infinitesimally small regions . to motivate its construction , consider a quantum field theory on a ( rigid ) background spacetime @xmath1 which is foliated by spacelike cauchy surfaces @xmath2 .",
    "we pick a region @xmath3 and construct the reduced density matrix @xmath4 .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath5 is the von neumann entropy of this density matrix , and is a functional of @xmath6 .",
    "we propose to retain locality by examining ee for infinitesimal variations of @xmath7 ( and hence @xmath8 ) .",
    "schematically for a configuration @xmath9 on the cauchy slice , we define the double variation : @xmath10 the construction is pictorially illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndefine ] .",
    "let us now simplify @xmath11 by appealing to the fact that @xmath12 is a functional on the entire domain of dependence @xmath13 .",
    "we focus on backgrounds @xmath1 and regions @xmath8 for which @xmath13 is given by the intersection of past and future light - cones from two points , @xmath14 respectively . as a consequence we will focus on the variations inherent in which are due to the variations of one of the points , say @xmath15 , keeping the other fixed ( or vice versa ) . in this context @xmath16 for 2d and 3d cfts ,",
    "although ( [ eq : ndef1 ] ) pertains in any qft .",
    "we will exploit the fact that @xmath11 is naturally sensitive to a key property of the von neumann entropy , namely strong subadditivity ( ssa ) , which states that @xmath17 ssa is a convexity property of entanglement ; for regions in being small deformations of a parent region , this has a quadratic structure , which motivates .",
    "inspired by a beautiful construction of casini & huerta @xcite , we show that entanglement density can be expressed as a second order differential operator @xmath18 acting on ee by differentiating with respect to the coordinates @xmath19 of @xmath14 ( specified explicitly for @xmath20 in  [ sec : eessa ] ) .",
    "ssa then implies @xmath21 .    exploiting the holographic construction of ee in terms of bulk codimension - two extremal surfaces @xmath22",
    ", we argue that the variations of interest can be mapped to the motion of the extremal surface along its null normals @xmath23 . using standard differential geometric identities , this in turn",
    "can be simplified to a statement about the geometry side of einstein s equations @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the volume form induced on the extremal surface .",
    "indeed , as the main result of this paper we will show that the entanglement density is precisely given by ( [ eq : enngr ] ) for small perturbations in the ads@xmath27cft@xmath28 setup .",
    "we have therefore related ssa ( which can be regarded as a physicality condition on ee ) to a restriction on the spacetime curvature .    _",
    "nb : _ as this work was nearing completion we received @xcite , where a similar relation between ssa and bulk energy stress tensor has been discussed .",
    "similar results have been obtained by arias and casini ( unpublished ) .",
    "to set the stage for our analysis let us recall the proof of the c - theorem @xcite and f - theorem @xcite based on ssa , as in @xcite .",
    "we consider subsystems which are defined by the intersection of light - cones from two points @xmath14 in @xmath29-dimensional qfts . letting @xmath30 \\cap j^+[\\lcgen^- ] $ ] , we pick @xmath8 to be a cauchy slice for @xmath13 at constant time ; see e.g. , figs  [ fig:2dssa2 ] and [ fig:3dssa ] .",

    "for example @xmath39 even for states which are not boost invariant , since both @xmath40 and @xmath41 have the same domain of dependence . as a result",
    "we do not make any symmetry assumptions about the state for which ee is evaluated .",
    "now consider moving @xmath15 from its original location @xmath42 along the light - cone directions to @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively by an amount @xmath45 .",

    "we can equivalently consider translating @xmath46 by a distance @xmath47 . under these shifts",
    "we track the implications of ssa .",
    "in fact , in the present case we simply need to plug in the explicit dependence of the coordinates of the end - points of the various regions : @xmath48 the inequality , upon expanding to second order in @xmath45 , immediately yields @xmath49 repeating the argument with the roles of @xmath14 reversed , we obtain @xmath50 .    note",
    "that the inequalities @xmath51 can be saturated : as is clear from the relation to the entropic c - function @xcite , the entanglement densities @xmath52 are vanishing for the vacuum state of a cft .",
    "furthermore , they also vanish whenever the ee can be computed in a cft by a conformal transformation as in @xcite , which includes , for example , the finite size system at zero temperature and the finite temperature system with an infinitely large size .",

    "since both are directed in the opposite null directions , it is obvious that if the state is completely separated into the left and right - moving sector , the entanglement should be trivial .",

    "although we have written the expressions and in a manner which suggests an obvious generalization to higher @xmath29 , there are some subtleties with this interpretation , which we revisit in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "having understood the basic constraint on the entanglement density , let us now consider the holographic context , employing the ads@xmath27cft@xmath28 duality .",

    "it is interesting to note that for normalizable states of pure gravity in ads@xmath105 , the entanglement density always vanishes .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier observation that entanglement density is vanishing for any state obtained by conformal transformations of ground states in 2d cfts .",
    "indeed , solutions in the pure ads@xmath77 gravity can be obtained by bulk diffeomorphisms corresponding to boundary conformal transformations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new quantity , the entanglement density @xmath11 for relativistic field theories , and argued that it provides a useful encoding of certain aspects of gravitational dynamics via holography . we have directly argued for its positivity using the ssa property of ee in 2d and 3d field theories .",
    "more generally , we see from our explicit analysis that the positivity of @xmath11 and the gravitational null energy condition go hand in hand . at the same time , we anticipate ( [ eq : nulle3 ] ) to be of fundamental importance , since it geometrically encodes the ssa and captures second order variations of holographic entanglement entropy .    while our holographic analysis was carried out for linearized fluctuations around ads@xmath77 , we anticipate that holds at the non - linear level .",
    "in fact , it is tempting to conjecture a more general statement valid in any dimension : ssa implies that the entanglement density @xmath106 for any state of a qft with @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , translating the description of @xmath11 into holography one finds that holds for any deformation away from pure ads in arbitrary spacetime dimensions . to wit , @xmath108 one could try to follow the logic of  [ subsec:3dssa ] to arrive at the conclusions above , by considering variations of the past tip of @xmath13 ( cf .",
    "[ fig:3dssa ] with each point replaced by @xmath109 ) . however , this attempt runs afoul of sub - leading divergences in the entanglement entropy from the r.h.s .  of as explained in @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to contemplate whether the entanglement density can be used to provide further insight into c and f - theorems and generalizations thereof",
    ".    nevertheless we may draw the following analogy based on the conjecture above : the statement of ssa is reminiscent of the second law of thermodynamics since it asserts convexity of entanglement ( but under region variation as opposed to time variation ) .",
    "we are arguing that this guarantees positivity of the entanglement density . via holography , generic deformations about the cft vacuum ( equilibrium ) then increase the ` cosmological einstein tensor ' @xmath110 when suitably averaged over the extremal surface . in essence , this quantity codifies a version of gravitational second law for entanglement density . indeed , in the ` long - wavelength ' ( hydrodynamic ) regime , one may capture the thermal entropy production via the entanglement density by taking @xmath8 to be suitably large .",
