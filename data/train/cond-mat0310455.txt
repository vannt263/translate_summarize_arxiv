    "the dynamics of many single molecule experiments can be described in terms of a `` particle '' moving along a one - dimensional substrate .",
    "for example , polymer translocation through a narrow pore can be parameterized by the number of monomers threaded through the pore .",
    "the motion of molecular motors such as kinesins , dyneins , myosin , helicase , dna polymerase , exonuclease and rna polymerase can be described by the location of the motor on the one - dimensional substrate ( microtubules , actin filaments , dna and mrna ) on which they move .",
    "similarly , the packing of a newly replicated dna or rna in viruses may be described by the molecular weight of the packed genome .",
    "these systems have been a subject of much experimental @xcite and theoretical attention @xcite .    under most conditions the motion of the coordinate describing",
    "the system is biased in one direction .",
    "the bias in the case of molecular motors and packing of newly replicated viral genomes is due to a chemical process such as atp ( or more generally , ntp ) hydrolysis , while for polymer translocation it can be generated by the different chemical environments on the two sides of the pore . for translocating single stranded dna , such a bias",
    "could be provided by adding , for example reca @xcite or other single stranded binding proteins ( which do not pass through the pore ) to the solution on one side of the membrane .",
    "single molecule experiments allow another source of bias to be introduced into the system , namely an externally applied force @xmath2 .",
    "this has been done , for example , by attaching a bead to a molecular motor @xcite or to the end of the genome which is packed into the viruses @xcite and pulling on it using optical tweezers .",
    "similarly , charged polymers have been translocated using an externally applied electric field @xcite .",
    "an interesting variant on these experiments is the single molecule measurements of wuite et al .",
    "@xcite on dna polymerase , which converts ntps ( nucleotide tri - phosphates ) into a ligated chain of nucleotides via complementary base pairing @xcite .",
    "wuite et al .",
    "apply a force @xmath3 not to the motor itself , but instead across the ends of the ssdna / dsdna complex to create a _ tension _ across the substrate on which the molecular machine operates . beyond a critical tension @xmath4 of order of @xmath5 pn",
    ", the motor goes backward and turns into an exonuclease .",
    "the severe stretching of the backbone of the complementary dna strand for @xmath6 presumably makes further conversion of ntps unfavorable and causes removal of nucleotides by the motor to be favored . forward and",
    "reverse motion of this enzyme are believed to be associated with different active sites @xcite .",
    "most theoretical treatments of these systems have assumed homogeneous ( or at least periodic ) systems .",
    "independent of the microscopic details , such problems can be described at long times by a random walker moving along a tilted potential or , equivalently , a biased random walker . for molecular motors such as kinesins , dyneins or myosins",
    "the assumption of homogeneity is indeed , in most experiments , entirely appropriate .",
    "however , in other cases the motion is along a one - dimensional _ disordered _ substrate .",
    "this is the case , for example , for rna polymerases , exonuclease and dna polymerases , helicases , the motion of ribosomes along mrna , the translocation of rna or dna through a pore , and the packing of a viral genome . in all these systems",
    "the one dimensional substrate reflects the heterogeneity of dna or rna , and leads to a modification of the coarse - grained effective potential in which the random walker describing the system moves .",
    "the potential now depends in a complicated way on the location along the substrate .",
    "two examples of potential energy landscapes of particular interest to us here are _ random energy _ and _ random forcing _ energy landscapes .",
    "we define a _ random energy _ landscape to be any effectively one - dimensional potential with a mean slope and fluctuations in the value of the potential with a finite variance about this linear tilt .",
    "a _ random forcing _ energy landscape has an overall mean slope but with energy fluctuations which are themselves described by a random walk . in this case ,",
    "the energy fluctuations about a linear tilt grow as the square root of the distance along the substrate .",
    "these two types of energy landscapes have been studied in detail in the statistical mechanics literature  @xcite and lead to strikingly different long time dynamics . in particular the random forcing energy landscape leads to behavior quite different from diffusion with drift when the overall tilt of the landscape is small , as discussed in detail below .",
    "recently , the effect of disorder in the form of defect sites in a rachet model which locally reverse the bias of molecular motors has been considered @xcite , using the methods of @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that even though fluctuations in the microscopic potential are bounded , the resulting _ effective _ energy landscape is random forcing .",
    "specifically , it was argued that when the defect concentration was large enough anomalous random force dynamics would appear .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite heterogeneity in base pairing energies also leads to a random force landscape in the context of dna unzipping .    in this paper",
    "we study the effect of sequence heterogeneity in both polymer translocation and molecular motors in detail for an exactly solvable class of simple lattice models .",
    "we consider both systems in the context of single molecule experiments that apply an external force pulling back on the polymer or the motor , which in the absence of this force are biased to move in one direction .",
    "we introduce microscopic models for both systems which can be solved _",
    "exactly _ both with and without disorder",
    ". a generalization of our motor model , discussed in section v and appendix d , can also be used as a very simple model of the dna polymerase / exonuclease experiments of ref .",
    "one can also consider closely related models of the packing of a viral genome . in this case",
    "there is an extra source of bias due to the energetic cost of packing the dna inside the virus .",
    "the externally applied force acts in conjunction with this bias while the motor acts against both .",
    "the details are very similar to the cases discussed here , with the exception that the energy cost of forcing the dna into the capsid does not necessarily vary strictly linearly with the amount of dna that has entered .",
    "we do not include a separate discussion of this interesting system .    ) .",
    "( b ) a finite chemical bias ( @xmath7 ) , where the light line corresponds to homogeneous or periodic environments and the solid line refers to heterogeneous environments .",
    "the anomalous dynamics ( @xmath8 , with @xmath1 ) arises in the vicinity of what would be the stall force , @xmath9 , for the homogeneous system . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the effective velocity depends on the width of the time averaging window , and tends to zero as the width of the window goes to infinity .",
    "the striped line denotes the region where anomalous diffusion is also present .",
    "[ fig : phasedia],width=302 ]    we show that sequence heterogeneity of single stranded dna or rna and heterogeneous base pairing energies have a dramatic effect on the dynamics of both systems . for a homogeneous substrate and no chemical bias ,",
    "the average velocity changes monotonically through zero as the external force is varied , changing sign as the force reverses direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](a ) ) .",
    "when a chemical bias ( which we take to act in the direction opposing the force ) is present , the scenario is similar with the velocity changing sign at a stall force , @xmath9 , which depends on the degree of chemical bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](b ) ) .",
    "in contrast , the combination of a disordered substrate and a chemical bias produces very different behavior for both systems . in this case",
    "we show that generically disorder introduces a random forcing effective energy landscape which is responsible for the anomalous dynamics .",
    "similar to the observation of harms and lipowsky @xcite a random forcing landscape is generated even if we neglect an explicit contribution @xcite from random base pairing energies .",
    "we discuss three different dynamical regimes which arise due to this landscape as the externally applied force is varied .",
    "the most notable transition arises in the velocity of the random walker describing the system .",
    "specifically , we find that there are critical values of the force @xmath11 and @xmath12 such that for any force between these values the velocity is zero in the sense that the average particle position @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes an average over thermal fluctuations , increases as a _",
    "power of time .",
    "we also discuss an even broader range of forces where the diffusion is anomalous ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](b ) ) .",
    "the transition points between the different types of long - time dynamics can be calculated exactly for the simple models studied here .    .",
    "( a ) no externally applied force .",
    "( b ) a finite externally applied force for homogeneous ( light line ) and heterogeneous ( solid line ) substrates .",
    "the anomalous dynamics arises in the vicinity of what would be the stall chemical bias , @xmath15 , for the homogeneous system . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] , the striped line denotes the region where anomalous diffusion is present .",
    "[ fig : changechem],width=302 ]    under special conditions a random energy landscape is also possible . in this case",
    "the expected behavior as a function of force is similar to a homogeneous system : the potential fluctuations simply renormalize the drift velocity and diffusion constant at long times .",
    "that is , as the applied force is varied the behavior is similar to that of a homogeneous system with no chemical bias .",
    "provided that random contributions to the energy landscape not associated with simple conversion of chemical energy can be neglected , random energy models describe the dynamics in the absence of chemical bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia](a ) ) on heterogeneous substrates .",
    "an alternative way to observe the anomalous dynamics is by holding the external force constant and varying the chemical bias .",
    "this can be done by changing the concentration of , say , nucleotide triphosphates for molecular motors , or by changing the concentration of the polymer binding protein in one chamber for polymer translocation experiments . in this case , when the force is held at zero , the velocity changes monotonically in tandem with the chemical bias ( see fig . [",
    "fig : changechem](a ) ) . however , when the external force is held constant at a non - zero value , a region with anomalous dynamics appears as the chemical bias is varied ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : changechem](b ) ) . between two values of the chemical bias @xmath16 and @xmath17 ,",
    "the displacement of the particle with time is again sublinear , in contrast to the same experiment performed on a homogeneous substrate . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : changechem](b ) the velocity is then a monotonic function of the chemical bias , changing sign at a stalling chemical bias @xmath15 .",
    "a summary of the qualitative behavior of the velocity as function of both the chemical bias @xmath18 and the external force @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bigdia ] .",
    "it is worth noting that there is no region of sublinear displacement when @xmath19 because the energy landscape is then random energy rather than random forcing , whereas when @xmath20 , there is still a random forcing landscape everywhere except exactly at stalling , but the randomness is too small in the vicinity of @xmath19 to cause anomalous dynamics .     and the external force @xmath2 .",
    "we neglect for simplicity contributions to a random force landscape ( such as fluctuations in base pairing energies ) which may be present even for @xmath21 . here",
    "it is assumed that the chemical bias always act in the direction opposing the force .",
    "the black wedge denotes a region of sublinear drift with time , i.e. , effectively zero velocity .",
    "[ fig : bigdia],width=302 ]    to keep the discussion simple , fig .",
    "[ fig : bigdia ] neglects contributions to a random forcing landscape other than those produced by the simple conversion of chemical energy along an inhomogeneous track .",
    "additional random forcing contributions will arise from , e.g. , base pairing energies in the case of helicases , which open up dna strands or dna polymerases and exonucleases , which add or delete complementary base pairs .",
    "motors , such as rna polymerases and ribosomes produce trailing strands of mrna and protein respectively .",
    "since these products are themselves heteropolymers , composed of monomers which interact differently with the solvent , here too we would expect additional contributions to a random forcing landscape .",
    "such effects will only accentuate the anomalous dynamics which is the subject of this paper .    before concluding this introduction",
    ", we should emphasize our perspective on the models of polynucleotide translocation and molecular motors studied here . in an effort to obtain simple , soluble models which incorporate heterogeneity",
    ", we intentionally neglect important molecular details such as those which describe the detailed pore interactions of the translocating nucleotides or distinguish the biological role of motors such as helicases , dna polymerase and exonucleases , rna polymerase , etc .",
    "the motors mentioned above perform important specialized functions such as opening double stranded dna , polymerization and depolymerization or creating messenger rna while moving along heterogeneous tracks .",
    "such functions are incorporated into our model simply by adding an explicit ( position - dependent ) chemical force to the energy landscape .",
    "more sophisticated attempts to get molecular details right ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite,@xcite and @xcite ) serve a valuable purpose , which can be important for modelling some aspects of the dynamics on various time scales .",
    "however , incorporation of sequence heterogeneity , neglected in most previous modelling efforts , is nevertheless crucial to correctly describe the anomalous long time dynamics ( e.g. , @xmath22 with @xmath1 ) near the stall forces in these systems .",
    "otherwise , we expect simple diffusion with drift ( similar to what we find here for homogeneous models or a random energy landscape ) at long times .",
    "we do not expect the multiple intermediate states and numerous rate constants of more sophisticated models to change our predictions of heterogeneity - induced anomalous dynamics at long times .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , to establish notation and provide a context for the rest of the paper , we discuss the homogeneous models for polymer translocation and molecular motors is some detail . in section",
    "iii the effect of the heterogeneity on the energy landscape is introduced .",
    "section iv discusses the resulting dynamical behavior and the exact location of the transition points within the models .",
    "finally , section v estimates the experimental range over which the anomalous dynamics may be observed for a few representative biological systems and discusses the effect of finite time experiments on the shape of the velocity - force curve .",
    "before turning to heterogeneous systems we first define microscopic models for both homogeneous polymer translocation and molecular motors .",
    "the simplicity of both models allows for their exact solution .",
    "dynamics in heterogenous systems will be treated in sections iii and iv .",
    "an idealized experimental setup is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : polymer ] .",
    "a polymer is threading through a narrow pore located on a two dimensional membrane which separates two chemically distinct solutions .",
    "for concreteness we consider the right side as containing a polymer binding protein which is absent in the left hand side .",
    "in addition , a bead , through which a resisting force is exerted on the polymer , is connected to the left end of the polymer .",
    "a model of this kind has been discussed by p. nelson @xcite as a simple example of stochastic rachet - like dynamics in biological systems ( see also @xcite ) . alternatively a force could be applied via an external electric field acting across the pore on a charged polymer @xcite .",
    ", width=264 ]    a convenient representation of the system is through a one - dimensional random walker located at a coordinate @xmath23 which represents the length of the polymer that has translocated to the righthand side .",
    "the conditions under which the full three - dimensional , multi - species problem can be simplified are reviewed below .",
    "the dynamics of the random walker is governed by the interaction of the polymer with the pore , the binding of the protein in the right chamber , and the externally applied force .",
    ", width=226 ]    before turning to a specific microscopic model consider the general form of the potential experienced by the random walker due to all these interactions . because we neglect sequence heterogeneity in this section , the energy due to interactions with the pore , @xmath24 , is some periodic function with a period given by the size of a monomer .",
    "an example is the sawtooth or rachet potential shown in [ fig : polymerpot](a ) .",
    "this type of potential accounts for an energetic barrier for translocation through the pore .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry reflects , for example , the difference in passing single stranded dna or rna in the @xmath25 direction through the pore as opposed to the reverse .",
    "the energy due to the interaction with the polymer binding protein is however very different and has the form @xmath26 , growing linearly with @xmath23 .",
    "thus the energy decreases as the polymer translocates to the righthand side .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is governed by the chemical potential difference per monomer , @xmath28 , of the polymer in the solutions on the righthand and lefthand sides .",
    "this chemical potential difference is a function of the protein concentration and its binding energy to the polymer ( a more detailed description of @xmath27 for the microscopic model discussed below is presented in appendix  [ chempot ] ) . finally , the backward force applied on the bead leads to a contribution to the energy of the form @xmath29 . upon collecting together these contributions ,",
    "the total potential experienced by the random walker , @xmath30 , is given by @xmath31 as is evident from the effective energy landscape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polymerpot](b ) , the random walker is moving in a periodic potential with an overall slope which depends on the protein concentration and binding energy as well as the external force .",
    "such a potential leads on long time scale and large length scales to motion which is diffusion superimposed on an overall drift velocity .",
    "thus , the average location of the particle @xmath32 behaves as @xmath33 while the mean square fluctuations about this drift behave as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend on @xmath37 and the details of the rachet potential ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    ", the brackets @xmath14 represent an average over thermal fluctuations .",
    "we emphasize that our simplified description in terms of a single coordinate @xmath23 that diffuses and drifts in a one - dimensional energy landscape is valid only when the translational motion of the polymer backbone through the pore is the slowest process in the problem  @xcite .",
    "in particular , this model assumes that the translocating polymer is not so long that the relaxation times in the cis ( left ) or trans ( right ) chambers exceed the diffusion time for the backbone through the pore .",
    "this simplified model is also inadequate if the polymer can become bound to the pore interior for long periods , as recent experiments suggest occurs for one of the best studied polymer - pore systems  @xcite .",
    "in this case , @xmath23 will still undergo biased diffusion on long enough time scales , but its velocity and diffusion coefficient will no longer be determined by a simple potential @xmath24 . finally , the effect of binding proteins can be captured by a single free energy parameter @xmath18 only when their binding and unbinding kinetics are sufficiently fast .",
    "the opposite limit , in which proteins bind irreversibly , but slowly , to the polymer , has also received attention  @xcite , but we will not consider it further here .     and @xmath38 respectively .",
    "[ fig : motor],width=377 ]    we now define a simplified microscopic model for the motion of a random walker in such a potential .",
    "our model is in the spirit of those analyzed for motor proteins in @xcite ( see also sec .",
    "ii.b ) , and allows exact results for the diffusion and drift on long times . in the language of @xcite our model is a @xmath39 model corresponding to a motor with just two internal states . more importantly , our model generalizes naturally to a _ heterogeneous _ version ( see section iii ) for which exact results are also possible .",
    "we allow @xmath23 to assume a discrete set of values @xmath40 , where @xmath41 labels distinct @xmath42 ( even ) and @xmath38 ( odd ) sites .",
    "we can allow different distances between @xmath43 and @xmath44 but require @xmath45 which we assume for simplicity is the size of the polymer unit which accommodates a single adsorbed protein .",
    "for a homopolymer the interactions with the pore are some periodic function with a period which we can take to be @xmath46 .",
    "to model this situation we take odd labelled sites to have a higher energy than even labelled sites .",
    "the arrangement is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : motor ] . even sites have an energy @xmath47 while odd sites ( corresponding roughly to the peaks in the rachet potential of fig . [ fig : polymerpot ] ) have a higher energy @xmath48 .",
    "also , indicated in the figure are the hopping rates which describe the dynamics of the random walker . the detailed balance condition ( in temperature units such that @xmath49 ) is satisfied by @xmath50 because of the lack of reflection symmetry in the translocating dna or rna ( for our model this asymmetry",
    "could be represented by taking @xmath51 ) , we expect the intrinsic hopping rates to be unequal , @xmath52 .",
    "the bias induced by the interaction of individual monomers with the reservoir of proteins on one side of the pore has been accounted for by the chemical potential difference @xmath18 . a more detailed discussion of the dependence of @xmath18 on the protein binding energy and its concentration is given in appendix  [ chempot ] .",
    "the effect of the applied force is included through the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "note that the bias controlled by @xmath54 arises only for steps from odd to even sites since a protein is assumed to bind only to a whole monomer .",
    "as pointed out , in @xcite , other @xmath55-dependences of the rates consistent with detailed balance are possible .",
    "we shall be content with the simple one displayed in eq .",
    "[ eq : polyrates ] which corresponds to choosing @xmath56 .    to show that this microscopic model embodies an effective potential of the form ( [ eq : pot ] ) , we eliminate the odd - numbered sites .",
    "this elimination can be accomplished by formally solving the equations of motion for the odd sites , substituting into the remaining even site equations , and taking he long - time limit ( see appendix [ master ] ) .",
    "alternatively we can invoke detailed balance and consider an effective energy difference @xmath57 between site @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath59 is even . upon setting @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the effective transition rate between site @xmath59 and @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 use of the rates ( [ eq : polyrates ] ) leads to @xmath64 as one would expect .",
    "note that when the force vanishes ( @xmath65 ) and the chemical potential gradient @xmath66 one has @xmath67 and no net motion is generated .",
    "more generally , an effective tilted potential of the form ( [ eq : pot ] ) is generated , with @xmath68 causing a drift of the polymer to the right .",
    "the external force on the left can reduce or even reverse the overall slope .",
    "such a potential inserted into microscopic rate equations for the even sites ( see appendix [ master ] ) is well known to lead to diffusion with drift on long time scales and large length scales .",
    "in fact , for this model using the results of @xcite and following @xcite one can calculate the velocity and diffusion constant exactly .",
    "after some lengthy calculations , one obtains for the velocity @xmath69 the diffusion constant of the model is given by @xmath70 with @xmath71    it is interesting to set @xmath65 and consider the limit of @xmath72 ( small chemical bias , no external force ) and the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( large chemical bias , no external force ) .",
    "when @xmath75 the velocity takes the linear response form @xmath76 in the limit of @xmath73 and @xmath77 , the velocity saturates at @xmath78 , with @xmath79 in both cases the velocity is a decreasing function of @xmath80 , as one might expect because the rate limiting step in this simple polymer translocation model is the energetic barrier as each successive segment passes through the pore potential .",
    "for the diffusion constant one finds similarly in the limit @xmath81 @xmath82 like the velocity , in this regime the diffusion constant decreases as @xmath83 increases .",
    "note that the diffusion constant deceases when @xmath18 increases .",
    "this behavior arises since the rate of backward steps decreases as @xmath18 increases . in the limit @xmath73 , and @xmath84 we find that the diffusion constant saturates at @xmath85 which also decreases with @xmath83 .",

    "two sources of heterogeneity affect polymer translocation .",
    "both arise for polymers composed of different types of monomer .",

    "nucleotide sequence could easily be incorporated into a numerical analysis of the dynamics .",
    "we first consider general features of the potential for a model with sequence heterogeneity .",
    "randomness in the composition of the polymer will of course modify the interaction potential between the polymer and pore , @xmath24 .",
    "it is easy to see that this leads to a random potential component with a finite variance around its mean value , i.e. , a random energy landscape .",
    "the second , more striking effect , arises from the randomness in the binding energy of the proteins .",
    "the associated force depends specifically on the location @xmath23 along the polymer . in a convenient continuum notation ,",
    "the total energy gained by attaching to the monomers has the form @xmath117 , where @xmath118 represents the different binding energies associated with the sequence of the polymer .",
    "if the sequence is random the fluctuations around the mean slope of the potential grow like @xmath119 .",
    "the effective potential experienced by the random walker is therefore @xmath120 where we have included the externally applied force , @xmath2 . a schematic representation of the potential is shown in fig . [ fig : polypotran ] .",
    "since @xmath117 has fluctuations which grow as @xmath119 , the sequential binding of proteins to a translocating polymer creates a _ random forcing _",
    "landscape , in contrast to the landscape defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : pot ] .",
    "because the energy landscape itself can be viewed as a simple random walk about a linear landscape , the _ random force _ contribution to @xmath121 ( an integrated random walk ) dominates the _ random energy _ term arising from interactions with the pore .",
    "as will be discussed in section iv this results in unusual behavior if the externally applied force lies in a certain range of values near the stall force .     for large @xmath23 .",
    "the same picture holds for molecular motors moving on a heterogeneous substrate powered by a finite chemical potential difference .",
    "[ fig : polypotran ] , width=302 ]    note that it is also possible to obtain a purely random energy landscape in polymer translocation .",
    "when the chemical environments on both sides match ( e.g. , for identical concentrations of binding proteins ) one has @xmath122 .",
    "the only random component of the energy landscape is due to the potential for translocating through the pore which has bounded fluctuations about its mean value . for this energy landscape ,",
    "the dynamics at long times and large length scales is then biased diffusion , with a drift velocity and diffusion constant renormalized by the heterogeneous interactions with the pore @xcite .",
    "we now explore these effects within our microscopic model of polymer translocation .",
    "the heterogeneity is introduced into the model through the rates ( [ eq : polyrates ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : depol ] ) , , the total change in energy after @xmath59 monomers translocate is given by @xmath124 here the @xmath125 are effective energy differences between two even sites corresponding to the set of values of the set @xmath126 drawn randomly . since the energy is a sum of independent random variables a _ random forcing",
    "_ landscape is developed .",
    "we expect that a simple _ random energy _ landscape results if we turn off the protein binding by setting @xmath66 . however , because the energy at even sites is always @xmath127 in our simple model , the landscape is just a uniform tilt in this limit . a more realistic model would allow additional energy variations at these sites . if we assign an energy @xmath128 to these even sites , it is straightforward to show that the total change in energy after @xmath59 monomers have translocated takes the form @xmath129 corresponding to a random energy landscape .",
    "we now turn to the effect of heterogeneity on molecular motors . here , as for polymer translocation , we select the set of parameters @xmath130 from a random distribution with a finite variance . for some motors and enzymes ( for example rna polymerase , helicases , dna polymerases and exonucleases  see introduction and below )",
    ", @xmath18 may also be random .",
    "this clearly only adds an additional contribution to the random forcing landscape . using the results presented above it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : de ] ) that the total effective energy change after @xmath59 monomers is given by @xmath131 here , each @xmath125 corresponds to an independent set of values of @xmath126 drawn randomly .",

    "the effect of this would be to modify the expression above to @xmath132 where @xmath99 is the additional contribution of the explicit random forcing from monomer @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting random forcing landscape is even more pronounced .",
    "the above scenario applies as long as the chemical potential difference @xmath106 . in the case",
    "when @xmath19 it is easy to see that @xmath133 unless we allow , as in the polymer translocation problem , for the energy at even sites also to vary and take the value @xmath128 . in this case we obtain @xmath129 corresponding to a random energy landscape provided @xmath128 has only short range correlations .",
    "although we could write the energy in the form of eq .",

    "the energy landscape for both polymer translocation and molecular motors is therefore qualitatively identical .",
    "generically , in both cases , a random forcing energy landscape develops .",
    "however , if the motor model without the applied external force has no bias ( i.e. , if @xmath19 ) , we recover the diffusion with drift dynamics associated with a random energy potential .",

    "this regime appears precisely at the `` stall force '' corresponding to a disordered substrate , namely @xmath161 if @xmath150 has a gaussian distribution this condition yields @xmath162 the resulting behavior as the force is varied is summarized qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] .",
    "it is interesting to consider the location of the stall force , @xmath163 , as well as the range of forces over which the displacement is anomalous , namely the region where @xmath164 , in some more detail for both polymer translocation and molecular motors in some simple scenarios .",
    "these quantities characterize how the location and width of the anomalous displacement region develops as a function of temperature and chemical forces .",

    "we focus on dna binding proteins .",
    "note that , like those of most such proteins , the binding sites are several nucleotides long ; unlike in previous sections , unless stated otherwise , we will give values of @xmath166 and other parameters normalized per nucleotide rather than per bound protein .",

    ", one finds that a force of about 1015 pn on the polymer is required to cancel the effects of the protein binding . in order to have @xmath199 , so that disorder effects can be detected , the value of the force must be controlled to roughly 10% or better accuracy .      to be able to measure the motion of a motor along a substrate it must remain attached long enough to be able to preform many moves across monomers . in other words ,",
    "if the rate at which the motor leaves the substrate is @xmath200 and the rate of crossing a monomer to the right or left is @xmath201 or @xmath202 respectively , then @xmath203 must hold . in the regime of anomalous dynamics",
    "@xmath201 is of the same order of @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , the condition will not be fulfilled in this regime when the rate of hopping against the chemical bias @xmath202 is always very small .",
    "there are , however , experiments where such a restriction does not hold . for example , the experiment by wuite et al .",
    "@xcite on the dna polymerase / exonuclease system ( see also @xcite ) monitors not the displacement of a single motor but the location of the _ junction _ between the ssdna and the dsdna .",
    "therefore , it is more natural to model the dynamics of the ssdna / dsdna junction and not of the motor . a motor which leaves the ssdna / dsdna junction",
    "is eventually replaced by a motor from the solution . within our models",
    "this can be represented by an internal state of the junction ( similar in spirit to @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a model of this type for the dna polymerase / exonuclease has been studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the disorder in the transition rates , present due to the heterogeneity of the dna , has been neglected . in appendix",
    "d we analyze in some detail a simple model of the dna polymerase / exonuclease system .",
    "as shown in the appendix it is straight forward to show that the presence of heterogeneity ( for example , in the energy gained from the hydrolysis of the different ntp s ) leads to a random forcing energy landscape .",
    "one therefore expects a region of anomalous dynamics near where the external stretching force @xmath3 causes a change in direction .",
    "we stress that more realistic models with many intermediate states can by analyzed similarly without affecting the existence of the region with anomalous dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , for this experiment an estimation of the width of the region is not straightforward .",
    "estimates , similar to those above for polymer translocation , can be obtained for the random force landscapes for a number of molecular motors which operate on dna or rna .",
    "two examples of interest are rna polymerases ( rnap s )  @xcite and helicases acting on double - stranded dna ( dsdna )  @xcite .",
    "an rnap s function is to transcribe dna  that is , to synthesize an rna `` copy '' with the same sequence as a dna molecule .",
    "to do so , it walks along dsdna trailing a growing rna strand .",
    "the rnap motor is powered entirely by the energy gained from the hydrolysis of successive nucleotide triphosphates ( ntp s ) as they are added to the rna molecule .",
    "although the mechanism of rnap motion is still the subject of debate  @xcite , many models suggest that at low enough ntp concentrations , its ability to move forward will be limited by the rate at which ntp s arrive at the catalytic site . a straightforward way to force rnap into a regime in which its motion is dominated by a random force energy landscape is thus to place it in a buffer with different concentrations of each of the four ntp s .",
    "the motor s ability to take a forward step is dependent on the incorporation of the appropriate ntp , and the rate of that incorporation is proportional to that ntp s concentration .",
    "thus , one can in principle make @xmath166 arbitrarily large and satisfy the criterion @xmath204 for significant random force effects .",
    "each factor of 10 difference between the concentrations of two nucleotide triphosphates , and hence in the rates to make a forward step , translates into a difference of @xmath205 in @xmath125 . of course",
    ", in practice other factors  for example the possibility that the rnap might fall off its dna track before the needed ntp arrives  will limit how large a range of concentration differences can be achieved experimentally .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether strong disorder effects can be observed .",
    "another class of motors that use dna as their track are helicases , which are needed to separate the two strands of dsdna in order to facilitate various processes in the cell such as cell division in prokaryotes .",
    "helicases move along the dna by consuming energy from ntp s .",
    "while some helicases only break a few base pairs at a time , others can move substantial distances along their tracks  @xcite .",
    "recent modelling of certain monomeric helicases  @xcite suggests that disordered dna sequences affect helicase motion primarily through the different energies required to open different base pairs .",
    "random sequences thus lead to anomalous helicase motion in much the same way they do anomalous dynamics of mechanical unzipping  @xcite . in the simplest case of `` passive '' opening",
    ", one finds that @xmath206 , where @xmath207 , which summarizes the forward force exerted by the helicase motor , is negative and has magnitude at least @xmath208 , and @xmath209 is simply the thermodynamic free energy cost of opening each successive base pair , with size roughly between 1 and 3 @xmath210  @xcite .",
    "one thus has @xmath211 .",
    "this large variance means that it should be relatively easy to observe anomalous , disorder - dominated dynamics in helicases as predicted earlier for dna unzipping .",
    "if , for example , one assumes that the magnitude of @xmath207 is near its lower bound of @xmath212 , then , in the passive opening model , disorder effects should begin to appear for a mechanical load opposing the motor s motion of as little as 7 pn and should persist up to at least 20 pn .",
    "all calculations of quantities such as the velocity have been done by taking the limit of very large times and averaging over thermal realizations with the same heterogeneous sequence . for experiments done over finite times",
    "the velocity will not be strictly zero in the regime of anomalous dynamics .",
    "instead , the velocity decays to zero as @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is the experimental averaging time used to define @xmath35 as @xmath215 .",
    "the closer @xmath152 is to zero , the faster the decay will be .",
    "therefore , the curve of the velocity as a function of the external force or chemical potential ( see figs . [",
    "fig : phasedia ] and [ fig : changechem ] ) will be rounded becoming sharper and sharper as @xmath216 . to illustrate this",
    "we have carried out simulations of model ( [ eq : rates ] ) on a single realization of the disorder averaging over thermal realizations and measured the @xmath217 curve .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : phasedia ] .",
    "the convex shape of the curve near the stall force is clear already for averaging times @xmath218 , corresponding to motors which transverse distances of @xmath219 at @xmath220 .",
    "note that , if one looks at the displacement of a single motor ( i.e. , without averaging over thermal realizations ) , the regime of anomalous dynamics will be characterized by long pauses at localized regions ( corresponding to deep minima of the effective potential ) with fast transitions between the localized regions ( corresponding to overcoming the barrier associated with the minima ) .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : simu ] shows a single trajectory of as a function of time for a given realization of disorder .",
    "the value of @xmath221 was chosen to be in the region close to the anomalous velocity regime but not inside it ( the point is at the edge of the anomalous diffusion region close to the normal diffusion region ) . as can be seen the motion of the motor is characterized by long pauses at specific locations along the track , with quick jumps between the pause points .",
    "the location of the pause points is reproducible for the same spatial disorder and different thermal realizations although their duration varies from simulation to simulation .",
    "note , that since the velocity is finite in this regimes , over large length scales the effect of the jumps becomes unimportant .",
    "these pauses correspond to local minima of the effective potential and as such are inherently correlated with the structure of the track . such pauses and jumps",
    "have been observed in recent experiments @xcite on dna unzipping .     for different values of @xmath214 .",
    "here @xmath222 and parameters where chosen with equal probability to be either @xmath223 or @xmath224 ( see text for notation ) .",

    "we stress again that such results also apply to more sophisticated models which include many internal states of the motor ( see the discussion of the dna polymerase / exonuclease system in appendix d ) .",
