    "this paper develops a pedagogical or `` toy '' model of quantum mechanics over sets ( qm / sets ) where the quantum probability calculus is the ordinary laplace - boole finite logical probability theory ( @xcite , @xcite ) and where the usual vector spaces over @xmath0 for qm are replaced with vector spaces over @xmath1 in qm / sets .",
    "quantum mechanics over sets is a bare - bones `` logical '' ( e.g. , non - physical ) version of qm with appropriate versions of spectral decomposition , the dirac brackets , ket - bra resolution , the norm , observable - attributes , and the born rule all in the simple classical setting of sets , but that nevertheless provides models of characteristically quantum results ( e.g. , a qm / sets version of the double - slit experiment ) . in that manner ,",
    "qm / sets can serve not only as a pedagogical ( or `` toy '' ) model of qm but perhaps as an engine to better elucidate qm itself by representing the quantum features in a simple classical setting .",
    "there have been at least four previous attempts at developing a version of qm over sets , i.e. , where the base field of @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "all these attempts use the aspect of full qm that the brackets and the observables take their values in the base field .",
    "when the base field is @xmath1 , then the models do `` not make use of the idea of probability''@xcite and have instead only a modal interpretation ( @xmath2 possibility and @xmath3 impossibility ) .",
    "the model of qm over sets developed here is based on a different understanding of the relation between the pedagogical model and full qm . instead of trying to mimic qm ( replacing @xmath0 with @xmath1 )",
    ", the idea is that qm / sets can perfectly well have the brackets and observables take values _",
    "outside _ the base field of @xmath1 ( e.g. , use real - valued observables = real - valued random variables in classical finite probability theory ) and even defining a more primitive version of `` eigenvectors '' and `` eigenvalues '' that are not ( in general ) the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of linear operators on the vector space over @xmath1 .",
    "the transitioning from qm / sets to full qm is then seen not as going from one model to another model of a set of axioms ( e.g. , as in @xcite ) but as a process of `` internalization '' allowed by increasing the base field from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the increased power of @xmath0 ( e.g. , algebraic completeness ) then allows the primitive `` eigenvectors '' and `` eigenvalues '' of qm / sets to be `` internalized '' as true eigenvectors and eigenvalues of ( hermitian ) linear operators on vector spaces over @xmath0 and the brackets can then also be `` internalized '' as a bilinear inner product taking values in the base field @xmath0 . hence under this approach ( and in contrast to the four previous approaches ) , the `` taking values in the base field '' is seen _ only _ as an aspect of full qm over @xmath0 and not as a necessary aspect of a pedagogical proto - qm model such as qm / sets with the base field of @xmath1 .",
    "since our purpose is conceptual rather than mathematical , we will stick to the simplest case of finite probability theory with a finite sample space @xmath9 of @xmath10 equiprobable outcomes and to finite dimensional qm . in the sample space",
    "has a probability @xmath11 but the simpler case of equiprobable points serves our conceptual purposes . ] the _ events _ are the subsets @xmath12 , and the _ probability _ of an event @xmath13 occurring in a trial is the ratio of the cardinalities : @xmath14 . given that a conditioning event @xmath12 occurs , the _ conditional probability _ that @xmath15 occurs is : @xmath16 .",
    "the ordinary probability @xmath17 of an event @xmath18 can be taken as the conditional probability with @xmath19 as the conditioning event so all probabilities can be seen as conditional probabilities .",
    "given a ( real - valued ) random variable , i.e. , a _ numerical attribute _",
    "@xmath20 on the elements of  @xmath19 , the _ probability of observing a value _ @xmath21 _ given an event _ @xmath13 _ _ is the conditional probability of the event @xmath22 given @xmath13 :    @xmath23 .",
    "that is all the probability theory we will need here .",
    "our task is to show how the mathematics of finite probability theory can be recast using the mathematical notions of quantum mechanics with the base field of @xmath1 is substituted , _",
    "mutatis mutandis _ ,",
    "for the complex numbers @xmath0 .",
    "to show how classical laplace - boole finite probability theory can be recast as a quantum probability calculus , we use finite dimensional vector spaces over @xmath1 .",
    "the power set @xmath24 of @xmath25 is a vector space over @xmath26 , isomorphic to @xmath27 , where the vector addition @xmath28 is the _ symmetric difference _ ( or inequivalence ) of subsets .",

    "the @xmath19__-basis _ _ in @xmath24 is the set of singletons @xmath30 , i.e. , the set @xmath31 .",
    "a vector @xmath32 is specified in the @xmath19-basis as @xmath33 and it is characterized by its @xmath1-valued characteristic function @xmath34 of coefficients since @xmath35 . similarly , a vector @xmath36 in @xmath37 is specified in terms of an orthonormal basis @xmath38 as @xmath39 and is characterized by a @xmath0-valued function @xmath40 assigning a complex amplitude @xmath41 to each basis vector @xmath42 .",
    "one of the key pieces of mathematical machinery in qm , namely the inner product , does not exist in vector spaces over finite fields but brackets can still be defined starting with latexmath:[$\\left\\langle \\left\\ {   u\\right\\ }    can be defined to play a similar role in the probability calculus of qm / sets .",
    "seeing @xmath24 as the abstract vector space @xmath27 allows different bases in which the vectors can be expressed ( as well as the basis - free notion of a vector as a `` ket '' ) .",
    "hence the quantum probability calculus developed here can be seen as a `` non - commutative '' generalization of the classical laplace - boole finite probability theory where a different basis corresponds to a different equicardinal sample space @xmath44 .",

    "<S> but the usual qm brackets @xmath4 give the `` overlap '' between states @xmath5 and @xmath6 , so for sets @xmath7 , the natural definition is @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows qm / sets to be developed with a full probability calculus that turns out to be the perfectly classical laplace - boole finite probability theory . </S>",
    "<S> the point is not to clarify finite probability theory but to elucidate quantum mechanics itself by seeing some of its quantum features ( e.g. , two - slit experiment ) in a classical setting . </S>"
