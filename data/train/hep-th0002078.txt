    "in this talk we describe recent work  @xcite on perturbative relations between gravity and gauge theories .",
    "although gauge and gravity theories are similar in that they both have a local symmetry , their dynamical behavior is quite different .",
    "for example , in four dimensions gauge theories are renormalizable and exhibit asymptotic freedom , neither of which property is shared by gravity .",
    "the structures of the lagrangians are also rather different : the yang - mills lagrangian contains only up to four - point interactions while the einstein - hilbert lagrangian contains infinitely many interactions .",
    "nevertheless , in the context of perturbation theory , it turns out that tree - level gravity amplitudes can , roughly speaking , be expressed as a sum of ` squares ' of gauge theory amplitudes . these tree - level ( classical )",
    "relations between gravity and gauge theory amplitudes follow from the kawai , lewellen and tye ( klt )  @xcite relations between open and closed string tree amplitudes . when combined with the @xmath0-dimensional unitarity methods described in refs .",
    "@xcite , it provides a useful tool for investigating the ultra - violet behavior of gravity field theories .",
    "the unitarity methods have also been applied to qcd loop computations of phenomenological interest and to supersymmetric gauge theory computations  @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet properties are one of the central issues for perturbative gravity . although gravity is non - renormalizable by power counting , no divergence has , in fact , been established by a direct calculation for any supersymmetric theory of gravity in four dimensions .",
    "explicit calculations have established that non - supersymmetric theories of gravity with matter generically diverge at one loop  @xcite , and pure gravity diverges at two loops  @xcite . however , in any supergravity theory in @xmath4 , supersymmetry ward identities  @xcite forbid all possible one - loop  @xcite and two - loop  @xcite counterterms .",
    "thus , at least a three - loop calculation is required to definitively address the question of divergences in four - dimensional supergravity .",
    "there is a candidate counterterm at three loops for all supergravities including the maximally extended version ( @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "however , no explicit three loop ( super ) gravity calculations have appeared .",
    "it is in principle possible that the coefficient of a potential counterterm can vanish , especially if the full symmetry of the theory is taken into account . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that this may indeed be the case for the potential three - loop counterterm of @xmath3 @xmath4 supergravity . for there to be cancellations of divergences beyond this , the theory would require a symmetry which we do not fully understand yet .    with traditional perturbative approaches",
    "@xcite to performing explicit calculations , as the number of loops increases the number of algebraic terms proliferates rapidly beyond the point where computations are practical . consider the five - loop diagram in ( which , as described below , is of interest for ultraviolet divergences in @xmath3 @xmath4 supergravity ) . in de donder",
    "gauge the pure graviton diagram contains twelve vertices , each of the order of a hundred terms , and sixteen graviton propagators , each with three terms . when expanded , this yields a total of roughly @xmath5 terms , even before performing any loop integrations .",
    "needless to say , this is well beyond what can be reasonably implemented on any computer .",
    "-.4 cm    our approach for dealing with this is to reformulate the quantization of gravity in the context of perturbation theory using the klt relations together with @xmath0-dimensional unitarity .",
    "the final topic of this talk will cover some recent progress in understanding the klt relations from a lagrangian point of view  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that with an appropriate choice of field variables one can separate the lorentz indices appearing in the lagrangian into ` left ' and ` right ' classes  @xcite , mimicking the similar separation that occurs in string theory .",
    "moreover , with further field redefinitions and a non - linear gauge choice it is possible to arrange the off - shell three graviton vertex so that it is expressible in terms of a sum of squares of yang - mills three gluon vertices .",
    "our formulation of perturbative quantum gravity is based on two ingredients :    1 .   the kawai , lewellen and tye relations between closed and open string tree - level s - matrices  @xcite .",
    "the observation that the @xmath0-dimensional tree amplitudes contain all information necessary for building the complete perturbative @xmath6-matrix to all loop orders  @xcite .      in the field theory limit ( @xmath7 ) the klt relations for the four- and five - point amplitudes are  @xcite @xmath8 where the @xmath9 s are the amplitudes in a gravity theory stripped of couplings , the @xmath10 s are the color - ordered sub - amplitudes in a gauge theory and @xmath11 .",
    "we suppress all @xmath12 polarizations and @xmath13 momenta , but keep the ` @xmath14 ' labels to distinguish the external legs .",
    "full gauge theory amplitudes are given in terms of the partial amplitudes @xmath10 , via @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the set of all permutations , but with cyclic rotations removed , and @xmath17 is the gauge theory coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath18 are fundamental representation matrices for the yang - mills gauge group @xmath19 , normalized so that @xmath20 . for states coupling with the strength of gravity , the full amplitudes including the gravitational coupling constant are , @xmath21 where @xmath22 . the klt equations generically hold for any closed string states , using their fock space factorization into pairs of open string states .",
    "berends , giele and kuijf  @xcite exploited the klt relations  ( [ kltexamples ] ) and their @xmath23-point generalizations to obtain an infinite set of maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) graviton tree amplitudes , using the known mhv yang - mills amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "cases of gauge theory coupled to gravity have very recently been discussed in ref .",
    "interestingly , the color charges associated with any gauge fields appearing in gravity theories are represented through the klt equations as flavor charges carried either by scalars or fermions .",
    "for example , by applying the klt equations the three - gluon one - graviton amplitude may be expressed as @xmath24 where the @xmath25 superscripts denote the helicities and the subscripts @xmath26 , @xmath17 and @xmath27 denote whether a given leg is a graviton , gluon or scalar . on the right - hand side of the equation ,",
    "the group theory indices are flavor indices for the scalars . on the left - hand side",
    "they are reinterpreted as color indices for gluons . for simplicity",
    ", the amplitudes have been expressed in terms of @xmath4 spinor inner products ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although the factorization of the amplitude into purely gauge theory amplitudes holds in any dimension .",
    "the spinor inner products are denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are massless weyl spinors of momentum @xmath31 , labeled with the sign of the helicity .",
    "they are antisymmetric , with norm @xmath32 .",
    "we now outline the use of the klt relations for computing multi - loop gravity amplitudes , starting from gauge theory amplitudes .",
    "although the klt equations hold only at the classical tree - level , @xmath0-dimensional unitarity considerations can be used to extend them to the quantum level .",
    "the application of @xmath0-dimensional unitarity has been extensively discussed for the case of gauge theory amplitudes @xcite so here we describe it only briefly .    the unitarity cuts of a loop amplitude can be expressed in terms of amplitudes containing fewer loops .",
    "for example , the two - particle cut of a one - loop four - point amplitude in the channel carrying momentum @xmath33 , as shown in , can be expressed as the cut of , @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and the sum runs over all states crossing the cut .",
    "we label @xmath0-dimensional momenta with capital letters and four - dimensional ones with lower case .",
    "we apply the on - shell conditions @xmath36 to the amplitudes appearing in the cut even though the loop momentum is unrestricted ; only functions with a cut in the given channel under consideration are reliably computed in this way .    -.4 cm    complete amplitudes are found by combining all cuts into a single function with the correct cuts in all channels . if one works with an arbitrary dimension @xmath0 in , and takes care to keep the full analytic behavior as a function of @xmath0 , then the results will be free of subtraction ambiguities that are commonly present in cutting methods  @xcite .",
    "( the regularization scheme dependence remains , of course . )",
    "an important advantage of the cutting approach is that the gauge - invariant amplitudes on either side of the cut may be simplified before attempting to evaluate the cut integral  @xcite .",
    "consider the one - loop amplitude with four identical helicity gravitons and a scalar in the loop  @xcite .",
    "the cut in the @xmath37 channel is @xmath38 where the superscript @xmath27 indicates that the cut lines are scalars . using the klt expressions ( [ kltexamples ] )",

    "( the tree amplitude can , however , have a contribution of the same dimension as that of the one - loop amplitude ; this contribution would depend on the details of the underlying fundamental theory . )",

    "maximal @xmath3 supergravity can be expected to be the least divergent of the four - dimensional supergravity theories due to its high degree of symmetry . moreover , from a technical viewpoint maximally supersymmetric @xmath3 amplitudes are by far the easiest to deal with in our formalism because of spectacular supersymmetric cancellations . for these reasons",
    "it is logical to re - investigate the divergence properties of this theory first  @xcite . it should be possible to apply similar methods to theories with less supersymmetry .",

    "this fact allows us to iterate the two - particle cut algebra to _ all _ loop orders !",
    "although this is not sufficient to determine the complete multi - loop four - point amplitudes , it does provide a wealth of information .",

    "<S> we review some applications of tree - level ( classical ) relations between gravity and gauge theory that follow from string theory . </S>",
    "<S> together with @xmath0-dimensional unitarity , these relations can be used to perturbatively quantize gravity theories , i.e. they contain the necessary information for obtaining loop contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we also review recent applications of these ideas showing that @xmath1 @xmath2 supergravity diverges , and review arguments that @xmath3 @xmath4 supergravity is less divergent than previously thought , though it does appear to diverge at five loops . finally , we describe field variables for the einstein - hilbert lagrangian that help clarify the perturbative relationship between gravity and gauge theory .    60 pt    -16 mm    p # 1 = = = by - by - by by 2 -to    # 1.#2#1#2 # 1.#2 # 1.#2.#3 - 1mu#1 ^ - | # 2 | # 3 ^ --1mu # 1.#2.#3 - 1mu#1^+ | # 2 | # 3^+-1mu # 1.#2.#3 - 1mu#1^+ | # 2 | # 3 ^ --1mu # 1.#2(#1#2 )    # 1_#1 _ # 1eq .  </S>",
