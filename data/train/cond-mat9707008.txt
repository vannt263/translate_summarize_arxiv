    "recently a new type of cluster monte carlo ( mc ) dynamics , the invaded cluster ( ic ) dynamics , based on invaded percolation has been introduced by machta et al . for the ferromagnetic ising model.@xcite the ic dynamics",
    "is based on the kastelein - fortuin and coniglio - klein ( kf - ck ) cluster formulation of the ising model @xcite and has been shown to be even more efficient than the swendsen - wang ( sw ) dynamics @xcite in equilibrating the system at the critical temperature .",
    "the ic dynamics has the advantage that the value of the critical temperature does not need to be known _",
    "a priori_. in fact the dynamics itself drives the system to the critical region as in self - organized critical ( soc ) systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the ic dynamics to frustrated systems where kf - ck clusters percolate at a temperature @xmath0 , higher than the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "in particular we will consider the fully frustrated ( ff ) ising model on a square lattice where it has been shown numerically @xcite that @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath4 is the strength of the interaction ) and @xmath5 .",
    "we will use two definitions of clusters .",
    "the first definition is based on the kf - ck clusters . in this case",
    "the ic dynamics leads to a soc percolating state at temperature @xmath0 corresponding to the percolation of kf - ck clusters .",
    "the second definition is more general @xcite and reduces to the cluster of kandel , ben - av and domany ( kbd ) @xcite in the ff ising model . in this case",
    "the ic dynamics leads to a soc state at the thermodynamical critical temperature @xmath5 .    in sec .",
    "ii we review the definition and the results of ic dynamics on ferromagnetic ising model",
    ". then we extend the ic dynamics to the ff ising model using the kf - ck cluster in sec .",
    "iii and the kbd clusters in sec .",
    "iv where we study also the equilibrium relaxation of the proposed dynamics .",
    "the rules which define the ic dynamics for the ferromagnetic ising model are very simple .",
    "let us start from a given spin configuration .",
    "as first step all the pairs of nearest neighbour ( nn ) spins are ordered randomly .",
    "then , following the random order , a bond is activated between the nn spin pairs only if the two spins satisfy the interaction .",
    "the set of activated bonds partitions the lattice into clusters which are classified every time a new bond is activated .",
    "when one of the clusters spans the system the procedure is stopped and the spins belonging to each cluster are reversed all together with probability @xmath6 .",
    "the spin configuration obtained can be used as starting point for the next application of the dynamical rule .",
    "successively , the algorithm has been generalized to different stopping rules @xcite and to different model ( the potts model @xcite and the widom - rowlinson fluid @xcite ) .",
    "the rational which is behind this rule is the well known mapping between the ferromagnetic ising model and the correlated bond percolation .",
    "@xcite in this framework bonds are introduced in the ferromagnetic ising model between parallel nn pairs of spins with probability @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the clusters ( kf - ck clusters ) , defined as maximal set of connected bonds , represent sets of correlated spins and percolate exactly at the critical temperature , @xmath9 .",
    "the well known sw cluster dynamics @xcite uses these clusters to sample very efficiently the phase space at any temperature . in this dynamics at each",
    "mc step the kf - ck clusters are constructed and the spins belonging to each cluster are reversed all together with probability @xmath6 .",
    "this produces a new spin configuration on which a new cluster configuration can be build up .",
    "the ic dynamics is very similar to sw dynamics and differs only on the way clusters are constructed . since the dynamic rule introduced by machta et al .",
    "builds up clusters which , by definition , percolate through the system , it is expected that the average properties of the clusters are the same as the kf - ck clusters at the critical temperature .",
    "in fact , in ref.@xcite it has been shown that the ratio of activated bond to satisfied interactions , in the large @xmath10 limit ( @xmath10 is the linear lattice size ) , is very close to the critical probability @xmath11 with which kf - ck clusters are constructed and it has a vanishing standard deviation .",
    "furthermore , the estimated mean energy also tends in the large @xmath10 limit to a value very close to the critical equilibrium value @xmath12 with the finite size behaviour expected in the ferromagnetic ising model at the critical point .",
    "on the other hand the energy fluctuation @xmath13 is not related to the specific heath .",
    "in fact , it has been found that @xmath14 diverges linearly with @xmath10 and not logarithmically as the specific heat does .",
    "the latter result points to the fact that the ic dynamics does not sample the canonical ensemble in finite volume and , therefore , energy fluctuations and specific heat are not any longer related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "since the fluctuation @xmath15 for @xmath16 , it is generally assumed that in the thermodynamic limit the ic dynamics is equivalent to the canonical ensemble even if a rigorous proof is still lacking .",
    "we now extend the ic dynamics to frustrated systems where the kf - ck clusters percolate at a temperature @xmath0 which is higher than the critical one @xmath1 . in particular we will consider the ff ising model on square lattice where @xcite @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath5 .",
    "the ff ising model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 takes the values @xmath20 and @xmath21 assumes the value @xmath22 on even columns and is @xmath23 otherwise .    in the simplest extension of the ic dynamics we introduce bonds at random between spins satisfying the interaction ( i.e. @xmath24 ) until a spanning cluster is found . as in the ferromagnetic case , at this point the spins belonging to each cluster are reversed all together with probability @xmath6 .",
    "the procedure is iterated until equilibrium is reached .",
    "we have done simulations performing measurements over @xmath25 mc sweeps after discarding the first @xmath26 for equilibration for systems with sizes @xmath10 ranging from 16 to 300 , and over @xmath27 mc sweeps after discarding the first 750 for @xmath28 .    in fig.1.a",
    "we show as functions of the system size @xmath10 the ratio of activated bonds @xmath29 to satisfied interaction @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is the energy ) , @xmath32 , and in fig.1.b the density of energy @xmath33 . assuming the size dependences @xmath34 and @xmath35 we find @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which are very close to the values @xmath38 and @xmath39 at the temperature @xmath17 . the errors on @xmath40 and @xmath41 decrease with increasing @xmath10 , denoting that the @xmath40 and the @xmath41 distributions become sharp when @xmath42 .",
    "the results obtained show that the dynamics has not driven the system into the critical thermodynamical state at @xmath43 , but to the percolation critical state at @xmath44 . in order to study the convergence as function of @xmath10 we have extracted for the ic dynamics at each @xmath10 an effective temperature @xmath45 ( see tab.1 ) by using @xmath46 ,",
    "then we have compared the ic energy density to the analytical energy density @xmath47 at @xmath48 ( fig.1.b ) .",
    "this analysis clearly show that the @xmath42 limit is reached in the ic dynamics very slowly .",
    "in particular the energy is systematically larger than that obtained by sw dynamics .",
    "furthermore , since the dynamics build up , by definition , percolating clusters the mean cluster size @xmath49 of ic clusters diverges in the following way @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a good approximation of the exponent @xmath52 of random bond percolation @xcite and @xmath53 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the behaviour found for kf - ck clusters for both the critical exponent and the prefactor @xmath54.@xcite this critical behaviour drives also energy and magnetization fluctuations in a critical regime , i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "this result is in strong contrast with the behaviour of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility at @xmath44 which behave as @xmath57 .",
    "in fact @xmath0 is not a critical thermodynamic temperature and both specific heat and magnetic susceptibility are finite at @xmath44 .",
    "this again stresses the fact that the ic dynamics does not sample the canonical ensemble in finite volume and shows that the spin configurations visited by the ic dynamics with a finite probability correspond to a much larger range of energies and magnetization than in any ordinary dynamics .",
    "it is interesting to note that the straightforward application of the ic dynamics to more complex systems as the ising spin glass ( sg ) model could allow to sample very efficiently the equilibrium spin configurations of the system at @xmath44 where the kf - ck clusters percolate ( in 2d sg @xmath58 @xcite , in 3d sg @xmath59 @xcite ) with a dynamics which exhibits soc .",
    "however since @xmath0 is usually much larger than the spin glass critical temperature @xmath60 ( in 2d @xmath61 , in 3d @xmath62 @xcite ) , any other dynamics does not suffer for slowing down .",
    "we ask now how to build up an ic dynamics able to drive a system to the frustrated thermodynamical critical temperature . from the analysis and the argument given for the ferromagnetic case",
    "we understand that the cluster definition needs to be modified in such a way that @xmath63 the frustrated system can still be mapped on the corresponding correlated percolation model and @xmath64 the clusters percolate at the thermodynamical critical temperature .",
    "@xcite the first conditions is always satisfied by the kf - ck clusters @xcite but not the second one .",
    "a general procedure to construct such clusters in a systematic way was suggested in ref.@xcite . in particular for the ff model",
    "this procedure leads to the cluster algorithm @xcite proposed by kandel , ben - av and domany ( kbd ) .",
    "@xcite to define the clusters in kbd dynamics one partitions the square lattice in a checkerboard way and chooses randomly one of the two patterns ( fig.4a ) . for each plaquette",
    "if three of four spin pairs are satisfied ( a single plaquette in the ff model can have either one or three satisfied spin pairs ) one activates bonds between the two spin pairs satisfying the interaction and facing each other ( fig.4b ) with a probability @xmath65 .",
    "numerically it was showed @xcite that the clusters obtained with such procedure percolates at the thermodynamical critical temperature @xmath5 , with critical exponents @xmath66 and @xmath67 to be compared with the thermodynamical critical exponents @xmath68 and @xmath69 .    with this idea in mind",
    "we propose the following invaded cluster dynamics . from the checkerboard partition",
    "we order randomly all the square plaquettes belonging to the chosen pattern",
    ". then plaquettes are tested in this order to see how many spin pairs are satisfied and , in plaquettes with three spin pairs satisfying the interaction , we activate bonds between the two spin pairs satisfying the interaction and facing each other . every time a pair of bonds is activated the cluster structure change and the occurring of a spanning cluster is checked . as in the previous cases when the first cluster percolates the cluster evolution is stopped and a new spin configuration is obtained by reversing the spin belonging to each cluster all together with probability @xmath6 .",
    "the dynamics proposed is related to the algorithm introduced by kbd exactly as the ic dynamics by machta et al .",
    "is related to the sw algorithm .",
    "we have tested the proposed algorithm performing measurements over @xmath70 mc sweeps on square lattices of sizes @xmath10 ranging from @xmath71 to @xmath72 and over @xmath73 mc sweeps on @xmath74 , after discarding the first @xmath26 for equilibration .    in fig.5.a",
    "we show the results of our simulations which give a situation very similar to that obtained in the ferromagnetic case .",
    "in fact , the ratio of plaquettes with activated bonds @xmath29 to plaquettes with three satisfied interactions @xmath75 , @xmath76 , reaches the value @xmath77 for large system size @xmath10 .",
    "at the same time the effective temperature @xmath48 ( see tab.2 ) , obtained by @xmath78 , converges rapidly to the limit value @xmath5 . in fig.5.a",
    "we shows also @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the estimated @xcite percolation temperature of kbd clusters in a square ff system of size @xmath10 .",
    "the mean energy per spin ( fig.5.b ) @xmath41 tends , within the numerical precision obtained , towards the thermodynamic value at the critical temperature @xmath81 with the expected size dependence @xmath82 .",
    "the fit of the data gives @xmath83 .",
    "the errors on @xmath84 and @xmath41 go to zero with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "the estimated mean cluster size exponents @xmath85 ( fig.6 ) does not coincide with the expected values @xmath86.@xcite we explain this result with the very slow convergence as function of @xmath10 of the percolation quantities obtained with the kbd - clusters ( see for example fig.8 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus we expect to recover the right behavior only for sizes fairly large .",
    "we have studied the energy and magnetization fluctuations also in this case ( fig.7 ) and found that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "these exponents , as in the previous cases do not agree with those expected for specific heat and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "as in the ferromagnetic case we obtain that energy and magnetization fluctuations are larger in the ic dynamics than in the canonical ensemble .    we have also studied the equilibrium relaxation of the magnetization of the proposed ic dynamics @xmath89 where the time @xmath90 is measured in mc steps . as shown in fig.8 @xmath91",
    "vanishes in few mc steps .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath92 defined as @xmath93 is reported in tab.3 for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath94 is extremely week since @xmath92 reaches a plateau very quickly .",
    "the value obtained @xmath95 is lower than that obtained in the kbd dynamics @xmath96 and show a weak tendency to decrease with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "we have shown how the ic dynamics introduced by machta et al . for the ferromagnetic ising model can be extended to the ff ising model on a square lattice .",
    "the straightforward extension with kf - ck clusters shows that the ic dynamics leads to a self organized critical ( soc ) percolating state at the percolation temperature @xmath0 and can be used to produce equilibrium spin configurations at temperature different from the thermodynamical critical temperature , actually at the percolation temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics is characterized by intrinsic diverging fluctuations and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is no more valid .",
    "the extension with kbd clusters , whose percolation point coincide in the large @xmath10 limit with the critical point of the ff system , has properties very similar to those obtained in the ferromagnetic model : it drives the system to the critical region without a previous knowledge of the critical temperature and gives a reasonably good estimation of the average energy at the critical point .",
    "the estimated integrated autocorrelation time is smaller than that obtained in the kbd dynamics .",
    "we have also stressed that the extension has been possible since there exists a percolation model into which the ff square ising model can be exactly mapped .",
    "the extension to other frustrated systems , such as spin glass , in principle can be done using the systematic procedure suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "the computation have been done on decstation 3000/500 with alpha processor .",
    "henceforth we choose @xmath97 such that temperature @xmath98 and energy @xmath99 are dimensionless .",
    "furthermore we choose unitary lattice space @xmath100 and unitary bohr magneton @xmath101 such that the linear lattice size @xmath102 and the magnetization @xmath103 are also dimensionless . in this way all considered quantities are dimensionless where not differently specified .",
    "the two conditions @xmath63 and @xmath64 have been discussed in detail in ref.@xcite . in general these two conditions are not sufficient to be sure that percolation clusters represent spin - correlated regions , i.e. to be sure that the set of percolation critical exponents coincides with the set of thermodynamical critical exponents ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 and so on ) .",
    "however in many cases it has been shown @xcite that these two conditions allow a dramatic decrease of the critical slowing down .",
    "in ref.@xcite it has been also numerically studied a ff model ( called asymmetric ff model ) where the antiferromagnetic interaction strength is @xmath106 times the ferromagnetic interaction strength , with @xmath107 , showing that it is always possible to find a cluster definition ( different from kf - ck one and kbd one ) such that @xmath9 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and so on , within the numerical precision .",
    "let s note that in this paper we are considering the symmetric ff model ( @xmath108 ) where only @xmath9 and @xmath104 still holds within the numerical precision ( see text ) ."
