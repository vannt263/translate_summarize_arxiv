    "@xcite argued that the dead disk can remain until a few seconds before the merger , and can supply energy enough to explain the gbm event .",
    "however , their model seems to ignore or misestimate a few processes that affect evolution of an accretion disk in binary systems , such as the effects of the tidal torque from the companion and the critical ionization degree for mri activation .    in this letter",

    ", the disk forgets its initial condition through viscous evolution .",
    "then , the disk mass and the accretion rate decrease with radiative cooling , which leads to decrease of the ionization degree ( phase i ) .",
    "this eventually suppresses mri , forming a dead disk that remains around the bh until the binary separation sufficiently decreases ( phase ii ) .",
    "then , the heating by the tidal torque from the companion becomes effective , which reactivates mri in the entire region of the disk , restarting accretion onto the bh ( phase iii - i ) .",
    "this disk `` revival '' happens many years before the merger .",
    "the mass accretion rate increases as the separation decreases , and a relativistic jet could be launched owing to high accretion rate ( phase iii - ii ) .",
    "the luminosity of the jets are too low to explain the gbm event , but detectable by the optical transient surveys or x - ray monitoring systems if the merger events happen in the local universe ( @xmath0 mpc ) or if bhs are very massive ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "this means that the initial mass and/or initial radius of the ring are unimportant , because the disk forgets them due to viscous evolution before the merger .    for the well - known solution of an accretion disk around single bhs ,",
    "the disk outer radius increases with time as a result of the outward angular momentum transport @xcite . on the other hand , in a binary system ,",
    "the angular momentum of the disk material is carried to the companion by the tidal torque .",
    "is unchanged by the angular momentum transport from the disk to the companion if the mass of the disk is much lower than that of the companion .",

    "this is too small to produce powerful electromagnetic counterparts @xcite .",
    "note that although the initial mass @xmath38 appears in equation ( [ eq : md ] ) , it does not affect the mass of the dead disk as discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the disk cools down as the disk becomes lighter , which changes the disk state from fully - ionized plasma to almost neutral .",

    "we find that for our fiducial parameter set , @xmath68 is not massive enough to produce luminous electromagnetic counterparts @xcite .",
    "since @xmath68 strongly depends on @xmath2 , the dead disk can be massive enough for @xmath69 cm .",
    "while @xmath70 is longer than hubble time for such a wide separation , rapid separation decrease might occur by some mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in this situation , the inner region is always active for mri whenever the outer region is active as discussed in the next subsection .",

    "then , the mass inflow rate by the tidal torque is estimated to be @xmath79 when @xmath80 becomes higher than @xmath72 at @xmath4 , the mass accretion by the tidal torque reactivates mri at the outer region .",
    "the turbulent stress causes the material of the outer region to fall to the inner region with the mass accretion rate @xmath80 .",

    "after the revival , the disk profile is the steady disk solution as phase i , @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( see subsection [ sec : initial ] ) , while the mass accretion rate onto the bh is probably determined by the tidal torque , @xmath88 using the relation @xmath89 , we can write @xmath90 which is integrated as @xmath91 since the mass of the dead disk is conserved until the disk revival , @xmath92 for @xmath93 . also , we can integrate equation ( [ eq : vgw ] ) and obtain @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the time when the disk revives .",

    "we discuss detectability of the emission from the jets for three models : model a assumes massive stellar mass bhs that corresponds to the system of gw150914 @xcite , model b assumes intermediate mass bhs ( imbh ) that are expected to exist in the center of star cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
