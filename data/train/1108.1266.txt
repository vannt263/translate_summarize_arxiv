    "understanding equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena associated with phase transitions has become more and more important in various fields in physics , such as early - time universe , ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , ultra - cold atoms , and so on @xcite . in a second - order phase transition ,",
    "characteristic long - range fluctuations appear in the order parameter field , and for a quantitative study of static and dynamic critical phenomena @xcite , one needs a field theoretical method which can describe both static and dynamical processes involving strong fluctuations .",
    "emergence of long - range fluctuations makes naive perturbation theory break down and requires some sort of resummation , such as the method of the renormalization group or the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action @xcite .",
    "recently , the method of the 2pi effective action has received much attention since it can be applied to the phenomena in and out of equilibrium on an equal footing @xcite . in this method ,",
    "all the self - energy contributions for the two - point correlation function are first summed up and then the perturbative expansion is carried out in terms of the full two - point correlation function .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard method of the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) effective action in which the perturbative expansion of the diagrams is done in terms of the free two - point correlation function .",
    "the method of the 2pi effective action systematically resums higher order terms in powers of coupling constants , so that it is expected to take into account efficiently the large fluctuations near the critical point .    in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to static critical phenomena and leave dynamic critical phenomena for future study . as is well known , the most prominent feature of static critical phenomena is universality .",
    "in other words , several critical exponents which characterize the singularities in the vicinity of the critical point are solely determined by symmetry of the system , irrespective of microscopic details .",
    "in fact , only two of them are independent , and we take @xmath8 and @xmath0 to be studied in this paper .",
    "they can be read off from the two - point correlation function @xmath9 of the order parameter field as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of space dimensions ( now @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the correlation length , and @xmath14 is the critical temperature .",
    "namely , @xmath8 and @xmath0 govern the behavior of two - point functions _ on _ and _ off _ the critical point , respectively . in the momentum space ,",
    "the fourier transform of eq .",
    "@xmath15 gives the scaling form @xmath16 .",
    "recently , alford , berges , and cheyne employed the @xmath1 expansion of the 2pi effective action to compute the exponent @xmath8 of an @xmath2-symmetric @xmath17 theory in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "they solved the 2pi schwinger - dyson equation ( kadanoff - baym equation ) @xcite at the critical point , substituting the scaling form to @xmath18 .",
    "it was shown that at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the @xmath1 expansion this approach remedies the spurious divergence of @xmath8 at small @xmath19 , which is seen in the 1pi @xmath1 expansion , and leads to an improved estimate already for moderate values of @xmath19 .",
    "this success strongly motivated us to compute another exponent @xmath0 within the 2pi effective action .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 is also associated with the critical behavior of the two - point functions .",
    "it is not straightforward , however , to apply this method to the evaluation of @xmath0 . given two nonzero parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , one needs to fix the form of @xmath22 in the scaling region , which introduces a technical complication to the problem .",
    "fortunately , we notice that the exponent @xmath0 can be determined from the _ three - point vertex function _ @xmath23 with two elementary fields , @xmath24 , and one composite operator , @xmath25 _ evaluated at _",
    "in fact , its fourier transform ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma21def ] ) for definition ) _ at the critical point _ behaves as @xmath26 therefore , if one finds the equation for @xmath7 in the 2pi formalism , one should be able to compute @xmath0 at the critical point , similarly to the case of @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we develop the 2pi formalism for the three - point vertex function @xmath7 , and apply the @xmath1 expansion to compute the exponent @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate @xmath27 at the next - to - leading order in the 2pi @xmath1 expansion assuming the scaling form of the correlation function at the critical point .",
    "we then extract the exponent @xmath0 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma21 ] ) and examine whether an improvement similar to the calculation of @xmath8 is achieved .",
    "computation of the critical exponents has been challenged since 70 s , in the @xmath28-expansion @xcite and @xmath1-expansion @xcite appoarches in the 1pi effective action formalism .",
    "furthermore , the four - particle - irreducible ( 4pi ) effective action has also been applied in @xcite to get the higher order terms in the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "these methods are utilized to obtain a strict @xmath1 expansion series eventually .",
    "in contrast , our motivation here is to examine a possible improvement due to the self - consistent approximation provided in the 2pi formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we first define our model and then explain how @xmath7 is related to the critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the formalism with the 2pi effective action is introduced in the third section , where we also derive a self - consistent equation for @xmath27 .",
    "then , in the fourth section , we calculate @xmath29 in the 2pi effective action and compare it with the 1pi result , where some complications in the calculations are deferred to appendix .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary of our results and discussions .",
    "we consider an @xmath2 symmetric @xmath3 model ( @xmath30 ) in the three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the action is given by @xmath31     = \\int d^3 x       \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_i \\varphi_a(\\x ) \\partial_i \\varphi_a(\\x )      + \\frac{\\lambda } { 4 !",

    "the ground state is in a symmetric ( broken ) phase when @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and the transition at @xmath35 is of the second order .",
    "although the exponents are symmetrical about @xmath35 , we compute the critical exponents by approaching the critical point from the symmetric phase ( @xmath33 ) because the vanishing expectation value @xmath36 makes the computation technically less involved .    the two - point correlation function , @xmath37 , and its fourier transform , @xmath38 , are defined as @xmath39 where translational invariance in the equilibrium state is assumed .",
    "being in the symmetric phase , we treat @xmath37 as diagonal and we write @xmath40 unless otherwise stated .",
    "similarly the three - point vertex function with two elementary fields and one composite field , @xmath27 , and its fourier transform are defined as @xmath41 where summation over the indices @xmath42 and @xmath43 is implied and we have assumed translational invariance of an equilibrium state .",
    "notice that there is a relationship between the two - point function @xmath44 and the three - point vertex function @xmath7 .",
    "if one regards @xmath32 as the external field coupled to @xmath45 , then the differentiation of @xmath44 with respect to @xmath46 gives @xcite @xmath47 using @xmath48 which follows from the identity @xmath49 , one finds that the definition of @xmath7 yields @xmath50 the corresponding equation holds in the momentum space .",
    "in particular , in the zero momentum limit , one has @xmath51    at the critical point , @xmath35 , the exponent @xmath8 is determined from the low - momentum behavior of the two - point correlation function @xmath52 , while the exponent @xmath0 can be obtained from @xmath53 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma21 ] ) @xcite .",
    "this can be explained with the help of the scaling hypothesis applied to @xmath53 .",
    "near the critical point , the susceptibility , @xmath54 , behaves as @xmath55 with the critical exponent @xmath56 , which immediately implies that @xmath57 in the scaling hypothesis we assume the existence of a function @xmath58 and a constant @xmath59 such that ( @xmath60 ) @xmath61 when @xmath62 , the limit @xmath63 is regular and so is @xmath64 , which yields @xmath65 where the use has been made of @xmath66 ( see eq .",
