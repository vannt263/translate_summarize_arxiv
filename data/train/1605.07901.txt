    "the problem of the expansion of the third body disturbing function has been extensively studied since a long time .    in 1959",
    ", kozai @xcite developed a truncated theory limited to the second harmonic showing that the effects of the lunisolar perturbations may affect significantly the motion of artificial satellites .",
    "later , musen et al .",
    "@xcite took into account the third harmonic .",
    "+ kaula @xcite introduced the inclination and eccentricity special functions , fundamental for the analysis of the perturbations of a satellite orbit .",
    "this enabled him to give in @xcite the first general expression of the third - body disturbing function using equatorial elements for the satellite and the disturbing body ; the function is expanded using fourier series in terms of the mean anomaly and the so - called hansen coefficients depending on the eccentricity  @xmath0 in order to obtain perturbation fully expressed in orbital elements .",
    "+ it was noticed by kozai @xcite that , concerning the moon , it is more suitable to parametrize its motion in ecliptic elements rather than in equatorial elements . indeed , in this frame , the inclination of the moon is roughly constant and",
    "the longitude of its right ascending node can be considered as linear with respect to time . in light of this observation , giacaglia and bura",
    "@xcite@xcite established the disturbing function of an earth s satellite due to the moon attraction , using the ecliptic elements for the moon and the equatorial elements for the satellite .",
    "however , by comparing their expressions with respect to the representation of the disturbing function in cartesian coordinates , which is exact , we have noticed they are not correct .",
    "although lane @xcite highlighted some algebraic errors in @xcite , its development remains incorrect .",
    "the main limitation of these papers is that they suppose truncations from a certain order in eccentricity .",
    "generally , the truncation is not explicit because there is no explicit expansion in power of the eccentricity ; but in practice fourier series of the mean anomaly which converge slowly must be truncated and this relies mainly on the dalembert rule which guarantees an accelerated convergence as long as the eccentricity is small . since this is indeed the case of numerous natural bodies or artificial satellites , these formulations are well suited in many situations .",
    "+ however , there are also many examples of orbits of artificial satellites having very high eccentricities for which any truncation with respect to the eccentricity is prohibited .",
    "brumberg and fukushima @xcite investigated this situation .",
    "they show that the series in multiples of the elliptic anomaly @xmath1 , first introduced by nacozy @xcite and studied later by janin and bond @xcite ; bond and broucke @xcite , converge faster than the series in multiples of any classical anomaly in many cases .",
    "these was confirmed by klioner et al .",
    "@xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "the introduction of the elliptic anomaly increases seriously the complexity , involving in particular elliptical functions , e.g. , see dixon  @xcite . in the same paper",
    ", they give the expressions of the fourier coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 in terms of hypergeometric functions , coming from the fourier series expansion of the elliptic motion functions in terms of the true anomaly and of the eccentric anomaly , respectively .",
    "more discussions and examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ for completeness let us mention other researches developed by da silva fernandes @xcite using a semi - analytical approach based on the expansions in powers of @xmath4 in the neighborhood of a fixed value @xmath5 .",
    "note that this trick increases the radius of convergence of the fourier coefficients in power series of the eccentricity , but does not improve the speed of convergence of the fourier series .",
    "the aim of the first part of the paper is to propose a new expression of the disturbing function which is in closed form with respect to the satellite eccentricity and still permits to construct an analytical theory of the motion .",
    "we will show that the use of the eccentric anomaly instead of the mean anomaly as fast angular variable fulfills this requirement .",
    "on the other hand , the expansion must be supple enough to define a trade - off between accuracy and complexity for each situation .",
    "to this end , the use of special functions is well suited : the expansions are compact and easy to manipulate and the extension of the theory is chosen for each case by fixing the limits of the summations .",
    "the complexity is relegated in the special functions , knowing that efficient algorithms exist to compute these functions . in short , we shall develop an expression of the disturbing function mixing mainly the compactness of the formulation of giacaglia and bura @xcite in exponential form and the convergence of fourier series of the eccentric anomaly .",
    "even if some formulas written in this paper are already published in previous article , we think that for clarity and consistency , it is useful to present the developments from the beginning .",
    "besides the question of large eccentricities , the other issue concerning the third body perturbation is that it is explicit time - dependency .",
    "this should be taken into account when constructing an analytical solution , in particular by means of canonical transformations . to do this ,",
    "the key point is to start from a disturbing function using angular variables which are time linear .",
    "this is precisely the motivation to use ecliptic elements instead of equatorial elements for the moon perturbation , as explained above .",
    "in this situation , the pde ( partial differential equation ) that we have to solve to construct an analytical theory are of the form:@xmath6 with the obvious solution @xmath7 unfortunately , this nice mechanics is broken as soon as the fast variable of the satellite motion is no longer the mean anomaly @xmath8 , but instead is the eccentric anomaly @xmath9 .",
    "the equation to solve in this case looks like@xmath10 the solution of which is not trivial . in the second part of the paper",
    ", we propose a way to deal with this difficulty .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec - model ] , we present the hierarchy of the perturbations acting on a satellite and we define the hamiltonian used in our analytical theory of the third - body problem . sections [ sec - emdf]-[sec - esdf ] are devoted to the development of the moon and sun disturbing functions fully expressed in orbital elements , satisfying our objectives . particularly , we recall the expressions in spherical coordinates and in hill - whittaker variables : these are more or less well known results but they are expressed in a form suited for our use . in section [ sec - apps ] ,",
    "we show how our development can be used in a canonical lie transform , in order to eliminate all angular variables .",
    "in an inertial geocentric reference frame , we study the perturbations on a satellite orbit due to the earth s oblateness , the earth s gravity field and the attraction of external bodies ( e.g. moon , sun ) . the satellite ( mass @xmath8 ) and the third - body ( mass @xmath11 ) are respectively located at a radial distance @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the earth s centre .",
    "we suppose that @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here and subsequently",
    ", we will use unprimed variables for satellite and primed variables for the disturbing body .      in figure [",
    "fig : acc ] , we have plotted the evolution with respect to the distance , of the different parts of the gravitational acceleration :    * the keplerian part ; * the non - sphericity of the earth : zonal harmonic terms : @xmath16 and tesseral harmonic terms : @xmath17 ; * lunisolar perturbations .    the evolution of the atmospheric drag is also plotted using an exponential density profile  ( edp ) .",
    "we have the following hierarchy depending on the altitude :    * * low altitude * : the dominant perturbation is obviously @xmath18 , then the atmospheric drag ; * * medium altitude * : the dominant perturbation is always @xmath18 , followed by the lunisolar perturbations ; * * high altitude * : in this region , the lunisolar perturbations can reach or exceed the same order of magnitude as @xmath18 .",
    "since we are interested in studying the dynamics for highly elliptical orbits , and in order to simplify the problem , only the oblateness term and the third - body effects are considered .",
    "indeed , a satellite on this kind of orbit spends most of the time at a high altitude . in terms of semi - major axis @xmath19 and eccentricity @xmath0",
    ", we must have : @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the equatorial radius of the earth .",
    "we introduce the osculating orbital elements : @xmath19 , @xmath0 , @xmath22 the inclination , @xmath23 the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath24 the argument of periapsis and @xmath8 the mean anomaly ; and the classical delaunay canonical variables:[eq : eq_delaunay ] @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the geocentric gravitational constant , @xmath27 is the gravitational constant , @xmath28 the mass of the earth and @xmath29 . for compactness , we will note @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath32 of the system can be expressed as a sum of two terms:@xmath33 we have chosen to put in the main part @xmath34 of the hamiltonian , the keplerian part @xmath35 and the secular variations of the oblateness term in @xmath18 , noted @xmath36 :    @xmath37 \\ ; ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the mean motion defined by , @xmath39 the perturbing part @xmath40 , of order 1 , contains in principle the short periodic variations in  @xmath18 , noted @xmath41 , and the third - body perturbations @xmath42 ( moon , sun ) , which can reach the same order of magnitude than  @xmath18 ( see figure  [ fig : acc]):@xmath43 in fact , periodic perturbations due to @xmath18 are not considered in this paper ( this point will be discussed in the conclusion ) , and we retain only the part:@xmath44 note that , this perturbed hamiltonian is explicitly time dependent through the position of the disturbing body .",
    "the hamilton equations are written as follows : @xmath45",
    "let @xmath46 ( o , x , y , z ) be a reference frame and @xmath47 a point of spherical coordinates : @xmath12 the radius , @xmath48 the co - latitude and @xmath49 the longitude .",
    "for any couple of integers ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) with @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we define the normalized complex spherical harmonics @xmath54 by     [ eq : hs_conv_ferrers ] @xmath55    where the @xmath56 are the associated legendre polynomials of degree @xmath50 and order @xmath51 ( see e.g. abramowitz m. and stegun i.  a. @xcite ) , @xmath57 is the much more common ferrers normalization factor @xcite ( geodesy convention ) , and @xmath58 .",

    "note that @xmath76 is the opposite of the potential energy and thus @xmath79 .      in order to construct an analytical theory ,",
    "it is suitable to express the disturbing potential as function of the osculating orbital elements or equivalent variables .",
    "giacaglia @xcite established the first general expression of the lunar disturbing function in terms of ecliptic elements . as he wrote later , his approach to the problem is messy and obscure .",
    "having noticed some error calculations leading to relation  15 , lane @xcite proposed a new expression , but still not correct .",

    "such a formulation is given in giacaglia and bura @xcite , eq . ( 35 ) , but the normalization convention and some functions do not correspond to those used widely in celestial mechanics . for better understanding and more clarity ,",
    "we have chosen to present the main steps of the demonstration with the standard convention .",
    "an other proof is given in appendix [ an - method_2 ] where we have taken the approach used by giacaglia and bura @xcite .      in a first step , we express as function of the hill - whittaker variables @xmath12 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath23 and @xmath86 with @xmath87 the true anomaly ( see whittaker @xcite and deprit @xcite ) . for conciseness we will still use the inclination @xmath22 instead of @xmath88 .",
    "we begin by expressing the complex spherical harmonics of the satellite @xmath89 in terms of osculating orbital elements .",
    "such a transformation is equivalent to a rotation of the equatorial frame into the orbital frame .",
