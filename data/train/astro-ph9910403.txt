    "van putten ( 1999 ) has proposed that superradiant scattering of magnetosonic waves by a kerr black hole plays an important role in the central engine of @xmath0-ray bursts . in his model ,",
    "the tidal breakup of a magnetized neutron star as it spirals into a kerr hole creates a massive torus and a toroidal magnetosphere .",
    "inside , there is a current - free cavity which acts as a waveguide for fast magnetosonic waves bouncing between the horizon and the torus . as shown by uchida ( 1997 ) ,",
    "in the geometrical - optics limit these waves ( though not the alfven waves ) obey the same equations as the vacuum electromagnetic waves ( with ` spin - weight ' @xmath1 ) and hence are amplified by ` superradiant ' scattering . as the waves are assumed",
    "to be perfectly confined to the cavity , this leads to an instability in all superradiant modes . to calculate the degree of superradiance , van putten approximates the geometry as the interior of a very thin equatorial wedge extending from the horizon to infinity ( where the torus lies )",
    "this leads to a simple prescription for the angular eigenvalues in the separated wave equation , and these can then be used in the integration of the radial equation to obtain reflection and transmission coefficients . with this method van putten",
    "finds that scalar waves ( @xmath2 ) are reflected with a superradiance about ten times that calculated in the full spheroidal geometry ( van putten 1999 ; press & teukolsky 1972 ) .",
    "this is notable because ( in the full geometry ) superradiance increases with spin - weight , so this suggested that magnetosonic ( @xmath1 ) superradiance in the wedge may be more efficient than either scalar superradiance in the wedge or @xmath1 superradiance over the full angular scale . in this letter",
    "i calculate the @xmath1 superradiance using a method analogous to van putten s and find that the superradiance decreases , rather than increases , in the ` wedge ' geometry .",
    "in the newman - penrose ( 1962 ) formalism , all field quantities are represented by potentials obtained by projecting the fields onto a complex tetrad of null - vectors @xmath3 which satisfy @xmath4 and @xmath5 the electromagnetic field is then represented by the three complex scalar potentials @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the em field - strength tensor . in a similar manner the weyl and ricci tensors",
    "are expressed in terms of complex scalars , and the einstein - maxwell equations are expressed in terms of these scalar potentials .",
    "see chandrasekhar ( 1979 ) for a self - contained treatment .",

    "scalar waves have @xmath2 and gravitational waves have @xmath28    chandrasekhar ( 1979 ) has shown how to cast the radial equation into a one - dimensional wave equation with potential barrier of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is some combination @xmath31 ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 are functions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 given in c79 ; @xmath33=0 for @xmath2 ) , and where @xmath36 the new @xmath37 variable tends to @xmath38 as @xmath39 , and tends to @xmath40 as @xmath41 ( the outer horizon ) .",
    "the two signs are due to the possible double - valuedness of the @xmath42 relation . for @xmath43  the ` superradiant interval ' ( chandrasekhar 1979 )",

    "the solution may be integrated until it nears the singularity at @xmath50 , where the differential equation in terms of @xmath51 the solution of which is , the order of the @xmath52 solution term .",

    "the numerical method then entails integrating @xmath30 from the boundary condition at @xmath65 out to @xmath60 and finding @xmath66 and @xmath67    the scalar case has a very similar potential , given by @xmath68    -3{r^2\\delta \\over \\rho^4}\\right].\\ ] ] the scalar case can be integrated through the singularity using the same method as employed for @xmath1 , or by switching back to the usual function @xmath69 and using eq .",

    "these equations provide a prescription for computing the degree of superradiant reflection given only the angular eigenvalue @xmath70 appropriate to the angular geometry and the @xmath71 and @xmath15 values .",

    "van putten considers the simplified problem of a very narrow equatorial wedge .",
    "it is then assumed that the angular function is constant across this wedge : @xmath72 in equation  [ eq - teukang ] .",
    "approximating then @xmath73 and @xmath74 , eq .  [ eq - teukang ] trivializes to @xmath75 this process is somewhat like creating an @xmath76 mode .",
    "these eigenvalues contrast with the usual eigenvalues of the ` spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics ' ( teukolsky 1973 ) which follow from boundary conditions of regularity at @xmath77 and @xmath78 and are given ( for small @xmath79 ) by ( fackerell & crossman 1977 ) : @xmath80 \\label{eq - eigenapp1}\\ ] ] for @xmath1 , and for @xmath2 by @xmath81+o[(a\\omega)^4].\\ ] ] for @xmath2 , the wedge geometry changes the angular eigenvalue for @xmath82 from @xmath83 $ ] to @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenvalue adds to the height of the potential barrier , so the lower eigenvalue in the wedge geometry leads to much _ higher _ superradiance in the scalar case ( see  [ sec - results ] below for numerical results ) .",
    "an immediate worry arises in the @xmath1 case : the wedge geometry gives @xmath85 , which is _ higher _ than the minimal @xmath86 eigenvalues , which are @xmath87 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq - eigenapp1 ] ; @xmath88 is required for superradiance . )",
    "this suggests that the result obtained for scalar waves will not generalize to higher spins .",
    "but before drawing this conclusion firmly we must pose the problem as clearly as possible for the magnetosonic waves .",
    "[ sec - eigenpot ]    van putten s model postulates a force - free magnetosphere with a current - carrying torus surrounding a current - free toroidal cavity ( see van putten 1999 , fig .",
    "2 ) . since the boundaries of the region are defined by magnetic field lines , component of @xmath89 perpendicular to the boundary must vanish there .",
    "the force - free condition implies that @xmath90 .",
    "this still leaves a choice of direction in @xmath91 .",
    "i shall choose _ one polarization state _ , in which the components of @xmath91 parallel to the boundary must vanish .",
    "the boundary conditions are , then , just like those at the boundary of a perfect conductor . in the wedge geometry , these are that @xmath92 near @xmath93 , and hold in the rest - frame of the matter in which the @xmath94field is anchored .",
    "they also , it turns out , hold in any frame connected to this frame by a boost in the @xmath95 direction , and therefore the conditions can be specified in the ` locally non - rotating frame ' ( lnrf ; bardeen 1972 ) as long as there are predominantly @xmath96-direction bulk motions in the matter .    king ( 1977 ) gives the relevant lnrf field components explicitly in terms of the newman - penrose potentials @xmath97 , in the boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "evaluated at @xmath98 , the equations @xmath92 give @xmath99=0 \\\\",

    "so the necessary and sufficient conditions for the proper field quantities to vanish at @xmath93 are : @xmath102=\\im[\\phi_2]=\\re[\\phi_1]= 0.\\ ] ]    because we have assumed a time dependence @xmath103 , in specifying the value of the real or imaginary part of the complex scalars , we must consider modes with frequencies @xmath104 ; likewise , with azimuthal mode numbers @xmath105 the radial eigenfunctions ( which , due to separation , do not change when adopting the wedge - geometry ) obey @xmath106 therefore the solution , composed of two modes , of @xmath107 has vanishing imaginary part if @xmath108 , @xmath15 and @xmath70 are real . adopting then @xmath109 ,",
    "the ` trivialized ' angular equation will be satisfied , for @xmath110 the angular solutions of @xmath11 are related to those of @xmath10 by  @xcite @xmath111 multiplying this out and evaluating for @xmath98 yields @xmath112{_{\\scriptscriptstyle 1}s_{m\\omega}},\\ ] ] so choosing both angular functions to be constant is consistent . since the radial solutions to for @xmath11 also satisfy condition  [ eq - rid3 ]",
    ", this will lead to a vanishing imaginary part of @xmath11 as well .",
    "it can also be shown ( using chandrasekhar 1979 , eq .",
    "7.186 for each mode ) that @xmath101 $ ] vanishes , so the full boundary conditions are satisfied by eq .",
    "[ eq - wedgesol ]",
    "since the maxwell equations are linear , we can evolve the two radial solutions @xmath113 and @xmath114 independently from @xmath115 to @xmath116 to obtain the incoming and outgoing wave amplitudes .",
    "the amplitudes so obtained are invariant under @xmath117 , therefore the reflection and transmission coefficients so obtained will be just those obtained by considering either mode .",
    "this shows that the superradiance of linearly polarized electromagnetic waves in a thin wedge between perfect conductors can be calculated using of the equations outlined in  [ sec - nummeth ] .",
    "note that a particular polarization has been chosen ( the other polarization state would have boundary conditions which depend on the background magnetic field configuration ) , and magnetosonic wave have been shown to coincide with linearly polarized em waves only in the geometrical - optics limits .",
    "it is therefore possible that magnetosonic superradiance will be different , but this difference is unlikely to be large .",
    "i have calculated the degree of superradiant reflection for electromagnetic waves using both the usual eigenvalues as tabulated by press & teukolsky ( 1974 ) , and using the eigenvalues for the ` wedge approximation ' of @xmath118 .",
    "these are shown , in fig .",
    "[ fig - spins ] , with @xmath119 and for various values of @xmath23 , as functions of @xmath120 the maximum superradiance in the ` usual ' electromagnetic case is @xmath121 , and this falls to @xmath122 in the wedge approximation .",
    "i have also computed the scalar wave superradiance , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - spins ] .",
    "van putten employed the wkb approximation to estimate scalar superradiance , but the potential varies over a scale comparable to the mode wavelength .",
    "the @xmath2 results show that van putten s use of the wkb approximation is not very accurate , and that in fact the scalar - wave superradiance increases in the wedge geometry even more than he predicts , rising to a maximum value of @xmath123 , from a maximum of @xmath124 in the full geometry .",
    "the somewhat counter - intuitive result that superradiance decreases in the wedge geometry for @xmath1 while increasing for @xmath2 can be understood using the following heuristic argument .",
    "the angular eigenvalue @xmath70 links the angular and radial parts of the wave equation , effectively adding a term to the potential representing the angular momentum barrier ; this situation is familiar from quantum mechanics , where ( as in the @xmath125 case here ) , @xmath126 gives the total angular momentum @xmath127 associated with the eigenfunction labeled by @xmath128 . also familiar from quantum mechanics , @xmath129 i.e. @xmath130 is a lower limit to the total angular momentum ( resulting from the azimuthal variation ) , regardless of the value of @xmath131 ( which is , of course , always @xmath132 in the full - sphere case ) . generalizing this to @xmath133 , it is possible to construct an operator @xmath134 , analogous to @xmath135 but with eigenvalue @xmath25 , representing the angular momentum ( helicity ) about the radial direction , rather than about the @xmath136 direction ( goldberg et al .",
    "1967 ; campbell 1972 ) . for @xmath93 ,",
    "the radial direction lies in the @xmath137 plane , and we can write @xmath138 these equations imply that the total angular momentum has a value @xmath139 when the wave is confined to @xmath93 , in agreement with the ` trivialized ' angular equation  [ eq - trivang ]",
    ". that is , the helicity of the @xmath140 wave provides an extra component of the angular momentum barrier in the wedge which is not present in the scalar case .",
    "the phenomenon of superradiant scattering from a kerr hole has been understood for thirty years , but has yet to find astrophysical applications because the degree of amplification for electromagnetic waves tends to be small ; creation of an instability requires a very efficient ` mirror ' with reflectivity of @xmath141 .",
    "van putten only assumes @xmath142 superradiance in calculating timescales in his model , but his interesting analysis of the thin equatorial wedge suggested that the wedge geometry might greatly enhance superradiance , making its astrophysical importance very plausible .",
    "unfortunately the present , more detailed , calculations do not bear out this idea .",
    "the cavity in which the magnetosonic waves are confined must be @xmath143 dissipation - free to create an instability ; the assumption that such cavities can form in a natural setting requires justification",
    ". moreover , energy leaking to higher-@xmath71 or higher-@xmath15 modes will be even more weakly amplified .",
    "a remaining possibility for the importance of superradiance in a less idealized setting remains , however . if the wave is reflected ( or perhaps trapped ) close to the resonance radius @xmath59 ( rather than at infinity ) ,",
    "the outer part of the potential barrier could be avoided and superradiance increased .",
    "whether this increase might be sufficient to be astrophysically relevant requires further analysis .",
