    "the gilbert constant characterizing the damping of magnetization precession is one of the important phenomenological parameters that describe the collective magnetization dynamics of ferromagnets.@xcite .",
    "it is an essential input of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( llg ) for magnetization dynamics@xcite and as such is widely used in the analysis of magnetization reversal processes , which are crucial to magnetic recording technologies @xcite .",
    "recently , hybrid systems of ferromagnets and normal metals have also attracted considerable attention , in the context of the enhancement of gilbert damping at the ferromagnet - normal metal interfaces.@xcite despite tremendous efforts to elucidate the nature of gilbert damping in bulk ferromagnets , however , the microscopic processes responsible for the observed ferromagnetic relaxation in real materials are still not fully understood .",
    "the matter is complicated by the potential relevance of a number of different mechanisms involving eddy currents , magnetoelastic coupling , two - magnon and nonlinear multimagnon processes , extrinsic and intrinsic spin - orbit ( so ) coupling of itinerant electrons.@xcite without delving into a detailed discussion of various points of view , we note that a certain level of consensus has been reached in the recent theoretical literature about the central importance of so interaction of some form in conducting ferromagnets , although with a limited and rather indirect experimental support at present.@xcite    even restricting the attention to the so - based mechanisms of gilbert damping , however , the myriad of relevant energy scales ( namely , ferromagnetic resonance frequency , ferromagnetic exchange energy , intrinsic so splitting , impurity scattering rate , and spin dephasing due to magnetic or so disorder ) has led different authors to make qualitatively different predictions for the gilbert damping , for example , with regard to its dependence on the disorder strength.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , electron - electron ( @xmath0 ) interactions have mainly been discussed in the mean - field spirit , as the source of the exchange field in itinerant - electron ferromagnets .    in this paper",
    ", we set off to formulate a microscopic theory of the gilbert damping constant , which we then apply to a simple model , where the competition of different energy scales can be studied , comparing various points of view and also generalizing and extending the results existing in the literature .",
    "we wish to consider the interplay of magnetic spin splitting , intrinsic so strength , disorder scattering , as well as the strength of @xmath0 interactions in a single self - contained model without introducing any phenomenological dephasing or relaxation parameters .",
    "in particular , we find an intricate relation between the spin - drag correlations induced by @xmath0 interactions and the gilbert damping in two - dimensional electron liquids .",
    "we hope our discussion will bring the community a step closer to understanding the relevant microscopic mechanisms responsible for the gilbert damping observed in conducting ferromagnets and spin - polarized systems .",
    "so interactions , especially in narrow - band semiconductors , have recently received a great deal of attention in the context of spin - based electronics ( i.e. , spintronics ) . in particular",
    ", theoretical proposals to manipulate spins by means of intrinsic so interactions , without the use of magnetic fields or magnetic materials , especially in the so - called spin hall configuration,@xcite have unleashed a wave of theoretical research as well as experimental efforts to measure the effect.@xcite it is worthwhile noting that these activities have shown the need to better understand the fundamental aspects of intrinsic so coupling and its experimental manifestations .",
    "the role of @xmath0 interactions , furthermore , remains a relatively unexplored territory with regard to its interplay with interesting topological properties brought about by the so coupling , which lie beyond the conventional theories of electron liquids .",
    "in addition , the recent discovery of the aharonov - casher phase@xcite in narrow - band semiconductors shows that a study of the combined response to magnetic and so fields in a regime of weak and strong so interactions is of urgent importance .",
    "it is closely related to the topic considered here , i.e. , the spin response and relaxation in magnetized system with so interactions .    in this paper , we study an interacting electron liquid magnetized by an external magnetic field in the presence of so interactions .",
    "first , by comparing the macroscopic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) theory with a microscopically derived expression for the transverse spin susceptibility , we find the following relationship between the gilbert damping constant and the torque - torque correlator ( see eq .  32 below ) :",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath3 is the dimensionless gilbert coefficient , @xmath4 is the equilibrium magnetization , @xmath5 the volume of the system , and @xmath6 the torque induced by so interactions . to derive eq .",
    "( [ basicrelation ] ) we must neglect certain contributions of order higher than the fourth in the strength of the spin - orbit coupling : we will argue that this procedure is justified , not only at zero frequency but also at frequencies close to the ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "next we focus on the specific case of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with rashba so interactions induced by a uniform electric field perpendicular to the plane of the electron gas . in this case , we show that the gilbert damping constant can be expressed in terms of the spin - channel conductivity : the same result holds in a three - dimensional electron gas , provided the electric field responsible for the spin - orbit interaction is uniform in space . for the isotropic case , i.e. , when the magnetic field , the magnetization , and the so - inducing electric field are all perpendicular to the direction of the 2deg , the result is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fermi energy , @xmath9 is the momentum relaxation time due to electron - impurity scattering , @xmath10 is the rashba so - coupling strength normalized by the fermi velocity @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the degree of spin polarization , @xmath13 is the drude conductivity , and @xmath14 is the longitudinal spin - channel conductivity .",
    "the problem now shifts to the calculation of the spin - channel conductivity . we show that this can be done exactly ( subject to the usual weak - disorder assumption @xmath15 ) in the isotropic non - interacting case , with ladder vertex corrections playing an essential role in ensuring the correct behavior in the limit of strong so coupling .",
    "@xmath0 interactions can then be introduced using the formalism described in refs .  .",
    "the final result for the isotropic case at zero frequency has the form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the spin splitting of electronic states due to the combined action of the external magnetic field and the so effective magnetic field , @xmath18 is the ratio of the external magnetic field to the total effective field @xmath17 , and @xmath19 is the spin - drag coefficient .",
    "this expresses the gilbert damping as a function of disorder strength , magnetic field , so and @xmath0 interactions .",
    "one of the gross features of eq .",
    "( [ lambda_general ] ) is a rough scaling of @xmath3 with @xmath9 , which is particularly evident in the clean limit @xmath20 .",
    "we will see , however , that eq .",
    "( [ lambda_general ] ) describes in general a nonmonotonic dependence of @xmath3 on the scattering rate , due to the interplay between @xmath21 and other energy scales .",

    "it is important to note that eq .",
    "( [ lambda_general ] ) holds in the low - frequency limit , @xmath24 , which means in practice @xmath25 much smaller than all the other energy scales . for this reason",

    "technical details of the calculations are supplied in the appendixes .",
    "studies of the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials often start from a phenomenological equation of motion for the magnetization @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the expectation value of the spin - density operator at position @xmath32 and @xmath2 is the gyromagnetic ratio : for free electrons in vacuum , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the absolute value of the electron charge .",
    "an important assumption in the llg phenomenology is that the _ magnitude _ of the magnetization is fixed at a constant value @xmath4 ( determined by the minimization of the free energy ) , i.e. , we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the unit vector specifying the _ direction _ of the magnetization .",
    "the physical reasoning@xcite underlying this picture assumes a very large ( essentially infinite ) longitudinal spin stiffness which prevents changes in the magnitude of @xmath37 , while one focuses on the softer transverse modes  essentially ferromagnetic goldstone modes with a finite gap in the presence of intrinsic or extrinsic anisotropies .",
    "the direction of the magnetization @xmath36 thus provides the relevant degrees of freedom , whose time evolution is determined by the llg equation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the effective magnetic field defined as the functional derivative of the equilibrium free - energy _ density _",

( [ heff ] ) . ]",
    "the first term on the right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) of this equation produces a coherent precessional motion of the magnetization , conserving the total free energy , while the second term , known as the gilbert damping , is responsible for the relaxation toward equilibrium , i.e. , the lowest free - energy state .",
    "both terms vanish at equilibrium .",
    "notice that the llg equation is not restricted to the linear - response regime , as @xmath36 is allowed to wander away arbitrarily from the equilibrium orientation .",
    "the primary focus of this paper is on the microscopic calculation of the gilbert damping matrix @xmath42 .",
    "we concentrate exclusively on homogeneous systems , that is the situation in which @xmath37 is independent of position and depends only on time .",
    "in such a case , it is immediately obvious that any damping must arise from the coupling between the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "this is so since the nonrelativistic @xmath0 interaction is invariant under a uniform rotation of all the spins , and thus can not be involved in the damping of such a rotation .",
    "it will therefore be essential to include the so coupling in our microscopic calculation , and we will do this starting from the simplest model , and then try to generalize our conclusions to more realistic situations . note that although in our model we consider so coupling stemming from the relativistic corrections to the schrdinger equation , a kind of so coupling would also be possible in the presence of an inhomogeneous crystal magnetic field .",
