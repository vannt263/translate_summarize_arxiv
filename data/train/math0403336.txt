    "newton s method is one of the preferred methods to find roots of differentiable maps : it often converges very fast and it is very easy to implement .",
    "but there are problems : for example , even for polynomials , there are open sets of initial conditions for which the newton map does not converge to any root",
    ".    there has been substantial progress understanding the dynamics of newton s method for finding roots of complex polynomials : przytycki  @xcite has shown that all immediate basins are simply connected and unbounded ; shishikura  @xcite has shown more generally that if a rational map has a multiply connected fatou component , then it must have two repelling or parabolic fixed points ( which is impossible for newton maps of polynomials ) .",
    "hubbard , schleicher and sutherland  @xcite used this to find a rather small set of starting points which together find all roots of a complex polynomial ; and in @xcite there is a ( not very efficient ) bound on the number of iterations it takes to find all roots with given accuracy . in a different spirit",
    ", smale  @xcite has shown that newton s method is quite efficient from a probabilistic point of view .",
    "newton s method for transcendental entire functions is less understood .",
    "bergweiler and terglane  @xcite have shown that newton maps have no multiply connected wandering domains , and in certain cases no wandering domains at all .    in this note , we extend przytycki s result to entire holomorphic functions : _ for every root @xmath0 of a non - constant entire holomorphic function @xmath1 , the immediate basin of attraction for the newton map associated to @xmath1 is simply connected and unbounded_. this result goes back to the diploma thesis @xcite . while the result and part of its proof are in analogy to the polynomial case , it turns out that for entire holomorphic functions , but not for polynomials , `` virtual immediate basins '' play an important role : these are domains in which the dynamics converges to @xmath2 as if there was a root at @xmath2 ( subject to further conditions ; see definition  [ defvirtualimmediatebasin ] ) .",
    "we show also that _ every virtual immediate basin is simply connected_. the combinatorial restrictions on ordinary and virtual immediate basins are investigated in @xcite",
