    "supersymmetry is a powerful principle which brings control in quantum field theory .",
    "in particular its non - renormalization properties@xcite@xcite and its potential for solving the hierarchy problem @xcite make it appealing as an ingredient of phenomenology , enabling a description in terms of weakly coupled degrees of freedom . in practice",
    "however , the implementation of the principle requires breaking supersymmetry in a hidden sector and communicating the effects to observed phenomenology indirectly ; for reviews see @xcite .",
    "the issue is further complicated by the fact that breaking supersymmetry is not itself a generic possibility .",
    "it was elucidated by @xcite that presence of r parity and its breakdown can play a crucial diagnostic role for understanding generic possibilities of breakdown .",
    "a persistent problem of supersymmetry breakdown however is that such vacua may be only local minima and have the danger of relaxing to a true minimum where supersymmetry is restored .",
    "this unpleasant possibility is however easy to avoid if the tunneling rate to the true vacuum can be made much longer than the known age of the universe .",
    "new insights into consistency of supersymmetry breakdown in metastable vacua have been obtained recently in @xcite in the context of supersymmetric qcd . in such models",
    "several possibilities exist , e.g. , supersymmetry breaking vacuum need not be unique but could be degenerate with several supersymmetry preserving vacua .",
    "the issues involved in phenomenological implementation of these ideas have also been elucidated in @xcite .",
    "applications to cosmology appear for example in @xcite    the question of whether the metastable vacua are cosmologically stable against quantum tunneling for all ranges of couplings received early attention in @xcite in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) ( see for instance the reviews @xcite @xcite ) . in these models",
    "supersymmetry is dynamically broken in a hidden sector at a scale @xmath0 and communicated to the standard model through a  messenger \" sector at tev scale .",
    "the messenger sector has suitable interactions with both the hidden and visible sectors .",
    "the true vacuum in some of these models is supersymmetric and color breaking .",
    "supersymmetry is broken and colour is preserved only in metastable vacua .    in this paper",
    "we advance the point that it is not sufficient to study the stability of supersymmetry breaking vacua in their translationally invariant i.e. , spatially homogeneous avatar .",
    "generically topological defects such as cosmic strings or monopoles may obtain in the course of implementation of any particular scheme .",
    "such defects could arise in the early universe @xcite .",
    "it is then necessary to take account of their presence when studying stability issues .",
    "a class of topological defects can exist which can nucleate the formation of the true vacuum in such a way that the exponential suppression inherent in tunneling phenomenon no longer obtains . specifically , when a cosmic string is present in a false vacuum , such a local minimum can be rendered unstable against decay to a vacuum of lower energy @xcite@xcite .",
    "this process was studied by one of us @xcite in the context of phase transitions in grand unified theory ( gut ) models .",
    "it was shown that generically , the presence of the cosmic string entailed the consequence that false vacuum would  roll - over \" smoothly to the true vacuum without recourse to quantum tunneling . in this way ,",
    "a putative first - order phase transition becomes second order , with important cosmological implications .",
    "the same process is applicable here in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models .",
    "it is possible to establish the required results numerically where formal methods provide a suggestive answer .",
    "we study a model of supersymmetry breaking which contains two classes of vacua , color breaking and color preserving .",
    "the color preserving metastable vacuum becomes parametrically unstable in the presence of cosmic strings .",
    "this puts constraints on the model of messenger sector being used and may make some models unviable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section [ minima ] provides a brief review of the class of models we have studied here .",
    "section [ eom ] discusses the vortex ( strings ) ansatz possible in the relevant vacua and the equations of motion to be solved .",
    "the results of the numerical solutions are described in section [ numsol ] . a semi - analytic approach explaining the numerical results is discussed in section [ sec : stabans ] , followed by concluding remarks in section [ conc ] .",
    "in this section , we summarize the models of @xcite as discussed in @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry is broken dynamically in the hidden sector .",
    "the messenger sector shares a symmetry @xmath1 with the hidden sector .",
    "it is sufficient for @xmath1 to be global , but we consider the possibility of @xmath1 being local , permitting cosmologically viable strings .",
    "the case of global @xmath1 is also commented upon .",
    "the messenger sector is responsible for transmitting supersymmetry breaking from the hidden sector to the visible sector .",
    "this messenger sector consists of the following : a gauge singlet , @xmath2 , a pair of messenger quarks , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , belonging to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 representation of the @xmath7 color group , and a pair of chiral superfields , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in vector - like representations of @xmath1 .",
    "the possibility of anomalies in the hidden sector forces the introduction of extra superfields @xmath10 to cancel the anomalies .",
    "however , in this paper , we consider only ` minimal ' models which do not include these extra fields .",
    "the most general superpotential for the messenger sector is given by @xcite @xmath11 the three coupling constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are all positive by a suitable phase definition of the fields . in the case where @xmath1 is @xmath15 ,",
    "if @xmath16 is the @xmath15 gauge coupling and @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and @xmath10 have charges @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , the effective potential for the charged scalars after integrating out the hidden sector is given by @xcite @xmath20 in which the relation between the mass parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath0 is @xmath23 the factors @xmath24 @xmath25 are of order unity , with their signs dependent on the content of the dynamical symmetry breaking sector .",
    "there are higher - dimensional terms coming from more loops and these are what the ellipsis in the expression for @xmath26 stand for .",
    "in addition , there are contributions to the scalar potential coming from the @xmath15 d - term and f - terms . in",
    "what follows , we will consider the set of minimal models which satisfy @xmath27 .",
    "this set includes models in which there are no e fields , models in which @xmath28 , and models in which the e fields do not couple to p and n. after including the @xmath15 d - terms and f - terms and setting @xmath29 , we consider an explicit model in which ( @xmath30 ) , and the scalar potential of the messenger sector becomes @xcite @xmath31 we shall be interested in the case when @xmath32 which signals the breakdown of the @xmath15 .",
    "this makes @xmath33 unbounded from below , but in the total potential , higher - order terms in @xmath26 result in a deep global minimum far away in field space in which the visible sector is supersymmetric . for a viable local minimum , one must set @xmath34 in the expression for @xmath33 and in order to have @xmath35 simultaneously , we must have @xmath36 the local minima lie at @xmath34 and @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 along with the condition @xmath40 , stability of the local minima require the following relations between the couplings @xcite : @xmath41 @xmath42 condition ( [ condition ] ) is also mentioned in @xcite wherein it is noted that there is still a possibility of color breaking vacua when ( [ condition ] ) holds .",
    "the scalar potential of the messenger sector given in equation ( [ pot ] ) contains two important types of vacua .",
    "one of these , which will be denoted as @xmath43 later in the paper , is the supersymmetry breaking local minimum described above .",
    "this vacuum has @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which means that susy is broken while the color gauge group is unbroken .",
    "the other vacuum , which shall be denoted @xmath46 , also has @xmath44 but the fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 get non - zero vevs .",
    "this means that @xmath46 is a phenomenologically undesirable minimum in which susy is still broken but the color gauge group is also broken . if cosmic strings are supported , these vacua are modified to what will be denoted as @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "it will be shown in a later section that @xmath47 becomes parametrically unstable towards decay into @xmath48 .",
    "the next section describes the available string solutions .",
    "with the scalar potential for the messenger sector as given in ( [ pot ] ) , the full lagrangian for all fields @xmath49 can be written down .",
    "the fact that string solutions are cylindrically symmetric makes it convenient to use cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we ignore the z - dependence and look for time - independent solutions . in a local minimum , @xmath50 from ( [ pn ] ) and @xmath51",
    "is as given in ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the ansatz functions for the scalar fields are a simple generalization of the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen string @xcite@xcite , ( see also @xcite ) @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 the value of @xmath56 is given by the right hand side of equation ( [ pn ] ) note that the winding number for the p and n fields has been chosen equal and opposite .",
    "single valuedness requires that the phase complete a circuit of @xmath57 at infinity .",
    "this requires the phase to be an integer multiple of cylindrical angle @xmath58 .",
    "along with the choice of phase for @xmath2 as in ( [ sansatz ] ) , this winding ensures the condition ( [ eq : pnsphase ] ) .",
    "this is the expected minimal energy configuration .",
    "the phases for @xmath3 , and @xmath4 satisfy the expectation that their product remains negative . at the core of the vortex ,",
    "the fields p and n must vanish , and hence @xmath59 . at infinity , p and",
    "n approach their vacuum expectation values which are denoted by @xmath56 , and hence @xmath60 .",
    "similarly , @xmath61 approaches the value given in ( [ s ] ) at infinity but can be non - zero in the core",
    ". the value of @xmath62 can be non - zero in the core also , but its value at infinity is of importance in determining whether the resulting vacuum is phenomenologically viable or not .",
    "this is because the vacuum with @xmath63 and hence @xmath3 and @xmath4 non - zero is color - breaking .",
    "a vortex solution in p and n also includes a coupling of the fields to a gauge field @xmath64 .",
    "the gauge field behavior is described by a function @xmath65 defined through @xmath66 @xmath67 where for continuity of @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 , and e is the unit of the abelian @xmath1 charge . at infinity , @xmath68 is pure gauge and goes as @xmath70 and hence @xmath71 .",
    "the lagrangian for the system can be written as : @xmath72 where @xmath33 is as given in ( [ pot ] ) . after substituting equations ( [ pansatz]-[aansatz ] ) into the lagrangian ,",

    "cosmic strings are in principle possible for @xmath9 and @xmath8 in any representation other than the vector or the fundamental .",
    "thus , the conclusions of this paper have relevance to more general cases .",
    "we begin with calculating the field values at infinity which can be obtained easily from equations ( [ feom]-[heom ] ) . at @xmath81 ,",
    "all the derivative terms vanish due to translational invariance and so do the terms containing @xmath82 .",

    "the set of vacuum solutions consists of four solutions .",

    "their field content is as follows : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath43 is the desired supersymmetry breaking and color preserving local minimum described in section 2 . the value of g is exactly as required by equation ( [ s ] ) , and it is a function of the couplings .",
    "@xmath46 is an undesirable minimum in which @xmath63 and hence @xmath3 and @xmath4 get vevs . furthermore , what is interesting is that for all ranges of couplings , its energy is always lower than that of @xmath43 .",

    "a numerical strategy exists for solving equations ( [ pansatz]-[aansatz ] ) .",
    "this consists of using relaxation techniques , after discretizing the equations of motion on a grid converting them to a set of coupled polynomial equations . in conformity with physical expectations",

    "note specifically that for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , values of @xmath109 which are of phenomenological interest are immediately ruled out .",
    "it is for these ranges of the couplings that the corresponding metastable vacua are no longer local minima due to the presence of cosmic strings .    in the context of the early universe ,",
    "the parameters in the effective action are as a rule temperature dependent .",
    "the above results then imply that we may start with a phase wherein a state of the type @xmath47 may be a local minimum but with reduction of temperature , the string solution may not exist in the sense argued above . how this comes about in the present example",

    "the results for @xmath48 remain unchanged .",
    "a global cosmic string network is not desirable for stable cosmology @xcite .",
    "this is because the energy per unit length of a global string is divergent and can dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "however the divergence of the energy with distance from the string is logarithmic and a transient network of such strings can not be ruled out .",
    "we expect such a network to eventually relax to a homogeneous vacuum .",
    "even a transient network however , may be capable of destabilizing a particular local minimum according to the discussion of this subsection .",
    "in the previous section , the stability of @xmath47 has been studied numerically .",
    "as illustrated in table [ table1 ] , there are certain domains in the parameter space of @xmath12 , @xmath14 , and @xmath13 in which @xmath47 is not admissible .",
    "the non - existence of such solutions was then understood as an unavailability of @xmath47 for those parameter values .",
    "this numerical result can be confirmed by a semi - analytic treatment following an approach discussed in @xcite .",

    "this corresponds to the regions of instability shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "for example , when @xmath114 and @xmath112 = 0.65 , reducing @xmath13 below 1.43 drives its effective squared mass negative making @xmath113 unstable .",
