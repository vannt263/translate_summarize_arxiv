    "a system of two mutually coupled semiconductor lasers is a simple example of interacting nonlinear oscillators .",
    "this system has been experimentally realised using for example edge emitting @xcite , quantum dot @xcite , vcsel @xcite and dbr @xcite lasers and the observed dynamical phenomena include leader - laggard dynamics @xcite , frequency locking and intensity pulsations @xcite and bubbling @xcite . for recent reviews on the rich dynamical features of coupled semiconductor lasers we refer to @xcite .",
    "in the current paper we study this problem theoretically on the basis of a well established rate equation model . in general , there are two time scales which govern the character of the dynamics in coupled semiconductor lasers , namely the period of the relaxation oscillation @xmath0 and the delay time @xmath1 due to the separation between the two lasers . in the long delay case @xmath2 , it is well known that the synchronous state of two coupled lasers is in general not stable @xcite , which gives rise to leader - laggard dynamics and noise induced switching between the asymmetric states @xcite . in view of applications in small - scale and high - speed devices , we are however interested in the opposite limit , where the delay time is comparable to or even much smaller than the relaxation period . in this limit",
    "the rate equation approach is justified if the distance between the lasers is significantly larger than the optical wavelength itself . at even shorter distances ,",
    "composite cavity models have recently been used to describe effects due to evanescent lateral coupling @xcite . using typical values for the relaxation oscillation in the ghz regime and an optical wavelength of around 1  @xmath3 m",
    ", we therefore now focus on the case of two coupled lasers at distances between 10  @xmath3 m and 500  @xmath3 m .",
    "we observe that for small spatial separation and strong optical coupling , the two lasers can mutually lock into one of two stable one - colour states .",
    "these states spontaneously break the original symmetry of exchanging the two lasers , and both lasers emit light at precisely the same frequency but at different intensities . in this bi - stable regime the current state of the system",
    "can be conveniently observed optically from the amplitude of the light output of the lasers .",
    "there also exists a region of hysteresis , where the symmetric one - colour state is jointly stable with the two symmetry broken one - colour states , thus giving rise to a parameter region of tri - stability . for more moderate coupling strength ,",
    "the symmetry broken one - colour states become unstable , and instead symmetry broken two - colour states appear , which are similar to the ones observed numerically in @xcite . in this case , both lasers emit light at the same two optical frequencies , however the intensities of the respective colours are not identical in both lasers .    in order to study these and similar transitions in the dynamics systematically , we introduce a reduced five dimensional model , which allows for a bifurcation analysis using the continuation software auto @xcite . the transition from a one - colour to a two - colour symmetry",
    "broken state then corresponds to a hopf bifurcation from a symmetry - broken fixed - point state to a symmetry - broken limit cycle state in the language of bifurcation theory .",
    "we are in particular interested in the fundamental bifurcations , which bound the domain of symmetry broken two - colour states .",
    "we identify the relevant codimension two points , which organise the bifurcation scenario in this region , and explain the mechanism which gives rise to the large region of bi - stability between symmetry - broken two - colour states .    from the technological side there",
    "exists currently a strong interest in the development of small - scale devices which are capable of all - optical signal processing",
    ". one particular challenge , which has attracted a significant amount of recent research activities , is the design of all - optical memory elements @xcite .",
    "the goal is to design fast and efficient memory elements which can be switched between at least two different stable states via an external optical signal .",
    "at the same time it is also desired that the state of the memory element is accessible optically , and the optical output from one memory element should be able to trigger the switching in further elements , with little or no intermediate processing . based on these criteria , the question arises , if all - optical memory elements can be realised using two mutually interacting identical single - mode lasers . after having identified a number of interesting regions of multi - stabilities involving one - colour and two - colour states , we numerically demonstrate that these states can indeed be exploited for the design of all - optical memory units . by injecting suitable pulses of light into the coupled lasers we are able to switch between different multi - stable states . in order to assess the technologically relevant speed of the switching events , we define the write time as the minimal injected pulse duration required to trigger the switching event , and the read time as the minimum time after which the state of the memory can be obtained optically .",
    "we find read and write times of less than 100ps , which suggests the possibility of fast and simple all - optical memory elements on the basis of identical closely coupled single - mode lasers .",
