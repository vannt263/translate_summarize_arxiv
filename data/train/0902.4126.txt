    "we consider a quantum channel of finite dimension through which a quantum system in some state is sent .",
    "the output consists of another quantum state , and possibly some classical information .",
    "we are interested in the question to what extent the original quantum state can be recovered from that state and that information . in particular , we investigate if there are subspaces of the hilbert space of the original system , on which the state can be perfectly restored .    in the literature a hierarchy of such spaces , which we shall call _",
    "protected subspaces _ here , has been described .",
    "the strongest protection possible is provided in the case of a `` decoherence free subspace '' @xcite . in this case the channel acts on the subspace as a isometric transformation .",
    "all we have to do in order to recover the state , is to rotate it back .",
    "the next strongest form of protection occurs when the channel acts on the subspace as a random choice between isometries , whose image spaces are mutually orthogonal . then by measuring along a suitable partition of the output hilbert space , it can be inferred from the output state which isometry has occurred , so that it can be rotated back .",
    "this situation is characterized by the well - known knill ",
    "laflamme criterion , @xcite and the protected subspace in this case is usually called an _ error correction subspace_.    the weakest form of protection is provided in yet a third situation , which was encountered in the context of quantum trajectories and the purification tendency of states along these paths @xcite . in this case",
    "the deformation of the state is not caused by some given external device , but by the experimenter himself , who is performing a kraus measurement @xcite .",
    "also in this case the `` channel '' acts as a random isometry , but the image spaces need not be orthogonal .",
    "it is now the _ measurement outcome _ ( not the output state ) , that betrays to the experimenter which isometry has taken place . using this information ,",
    "he is able to undo the deformation of the component of the state that lies in the subspace considered .",
    "it should be emphasized that the latter form of protection is far from a general error correction procedure .",
    "the experimenter only repairs the damage that he himself has incurred by his measurement .    nevertheless , the above situations seem mathematically sufficiently similar to deserve study under a common title .    in all these three cases",
    "the experimenter learns nothing during the recovery operation about the component of the state inside our subspace . in this sense",
    "these subspaces can be considered `` dark '' , and this darkness is essential for the protection of information .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ theoremprotdark ] ) is concerned with the equivalence between protection and darkness , which is a consequence of heisenberg s principle that no information on an unknown quantum state can be obtained without disturbing it ( corollary [ heiscor ] ) .",
    "the question arises , for what channels protected subspaces are to be be found .",
    "we consider several examples in their kraus decompositions . in each decomposition",
    ", we look for subspaces on which the channel acts as a multiple of an isometry , to be called a _ homometry _ here .",
    "obviously , every ( kraus ) operator @xmath0 acts homometrically on a one - dimensional space @xmath1 ; its image @xmath2 is another one - dimensional space , and the shrinking factor is @xmath3 .",
    "however , one - dimensional spaces are useless as coding spaces for quantum states .",
    "what we shall need , therefore , is the recent theory of higher rank numerical ranges @xcite . with the help of this we shall be able to construct several examples .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief review of basic concepts including channels and instruments is presented in section ii .",
    "we discuss heisenberg s principle in section iii . and prove our main theorem , theorem [ theoremprotdark ] in section iv . in subsequent sections we analyze different forms of protected subspaces and compare their properties . in section",
    "v we review the notion of higher rank numerical range and quote some results on existence in the algebraic compression problem .",
    "some examples of dark subspaces are presented in section vi , while an exemplary problem of finding an error correction code for a specific model of tri  unitary noise acting on a @xmath4 system is solved in section vii .",
