    "galaxies on top of qsos ( gotoqs ) , defined roughly as foreground galaxies lying either directly along the line of sight to a background qso or within a few arcseconds of the line of sight , offer unique insight into the contents of these galaxies through their imprint on qso spectra .",
    "while qso absorbers have been known since shortly after qsos were discovered ( e.g. sandage 1965 ; burbidge , lynds , & burbidge 1966 ; arp , bolton , & kinman 1967 ) , little is known about the environments in which these systems arise .",
    "it is , however , well known that the evolutionary processes and histories of gas and stars are closely linked , and therefore studies of the properties of these systems can lead us to a better understanding of the environments in which they reside .",
    "critical to determining the characteristics of these environments is detecting these absorber galaxies in emission , both spectroscopically and visually in imaging .",
    "such detections will allow us to ascertain the galaxy morphologies , star formation rates ( sfrs ) , reddening values via balmer decrement and color excess , and luminosities .",
    "the qso impact parameter can be accurately determined if the emitting galaxy is well - imaged .",
    "one can also study how the stellar properties of the emission galaxy correlate with the properties of the interstellar material revealed through absorption lines .",
    "the detection of absorption host galaxies in emission at high redshifts has proven difficult .",
    "recent studies have made some progress in this regime , but the success rate is still low ( e.g. , moller et al .",
    "2004 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 , 2013 ; proux et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ; bouch et al . 2012 ; noterdaeme et al . 2012 ; kulkarni et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the issue is that surface brightness decreases rapidly with increasing distance , and therefore higher-@xmath10 galaxies showing absorption in qso spectra are much more difficult to detect in emission .",
    "we have circumvented this issue by choosing a sample of low-@xmath10 galaxies intervening with background qsos in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "these gotoqs are easier to detect in imaging and in spectral emission due to their low-@xmath10 nature .",
    "this sample is critical to understanding the links between absorbers and galaxies because it is the only way to study galaxies in both absorption and emission , whereas high-@xmath10 gotoqs may be only successfully observed in absorption .",
    "it is important to note that both low- and high-@xmath10 studies are necessary to track the evolution properties with cosmic time in gotoqs .",
    "a variety of techniques exist for detecting gotoqs , including matching catalogs of qsos and galaxies searching for overlapping or near overlapping positions ( hewitt & burbidge 1989 , womble et al .",
    "1993 ) , seeking absorption features in qso spectra ( bergeron & boisse 1991 , yanny & york 1992 , zych et al .",
    "2007 ) , finding galaxies with matching redshifts , and searching qso spectra for overlying narrow galactic emission lines ( noterdaeme et al . 2010 ; york et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter referred to as paper i ) .",
    "a more thorough discussion of these techniques can be found in paper i.    paper i utilized the last of these techniques to consider a sample of gotoqs systematically found in the sdss by their h@xmath0 emission line signature overlaid in qso spectra ( york et al .",
    "we have herein refined this search technique to search for nine galactic emission lines sharing a common redshift , including h@xmath0 , similarly overlaid on qso spectra .",
    "such a refinement promises to be much more complete , allowing us to detect gotoqs with fewer false positives and to increase the sample size of pairs to be followed up with absorption line spectroscopy to obtain the physical conditions in a number of galaxies .",
    "additionally , the increased sample size allows us to place finer constraints on the relationships between each of the properties we have measured .    section  [ section - sample ] details our sample selection and addresses any bias in the sample .",
    "section  [ section - analysis ] details our data analysis .",
    "section  [ section - results ] discusses our results .",
    "finally , section  [ section - conclusion ] summarizes our conclusions . throughout",
    "we have assumed the concordance cosmology ( h@xmath11 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "gotoqs were detected in the sdss dr7 ( schneider et al .",
    "2010 ) by systematically searching qso spectra for narrow galaxy emission lines .",
    "the process involved utilizing code originally written to detect absorption lines in sdss dr7 qso spectra .",
    "absorption line systems returned from this original search were compiled in a catalog , analyzed , and used in the results of , e.g. , york et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , vanden berk et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and khare et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . rather than rewrite the code to detect emission lines , the input spectra were inverted , thereby turning emission lines into `` absorption '' lines capable of being detected by this code ( lundgren et al . 2009 ; vikas et al . 2013 ; york et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the output is then a list of identified wavelengths for detected emission lines .",
    "nine emission lines were searched for : h@xmath0 ( @xmath146564.61 ) , h@xmath15 ( @xmath144862.72 ) , [ o ii]@xmath143727 , [ o iii]@xmath164960.30 , 5008.24 , [ n ii]@xmath166549.86 , 6585.27 , and [ s  ii ]  @xmath166718.29 , 6732.67 ( all cited wavelengths are vacuum wavelengths ) . a minimum of two emission lines are required to determine an accurate redshift for any foreground objects to which the emission lines belong , however , any system with fewer than three detected emission lines is ignored .",
    "a further requirement for this sample was the presence of the h@xmath0 line , therefore restricting the redshift range to @xmath170.401 . at redshifts above this value ,",
    "the h@xmath0 line is out of sdss spectrograph range ( 3800   to 9200  ) .",
    "the line identification code was run on the database of qso spectra in dr7 .",
    "the code searched 104,374 qso spectra , returning 635 systems with at least three emission lines , 85 of which had at least four emission lines .",
    "all the systems chosen for this study had at least 3 lines with significance level ( sl ) @xmath18 ( that is , the measured flux is at least 4 times stronger than the 1@xmath19 detection limit for the relevant region of the spectrum ) .",
    "even though the qso spectra search is automated , each detection must be confirmed by eye to eliminate false positives that may arise .",
    "we present here the results of this search . of these 85 objects found ,",
    "50 were found to be legitimate pairs after visually examining both the spectra and the images contained in the sdss catalogue archive server ( cas ) database . within these legitimate pairs ,",
    "23 were previously treated in paper i and so are not relisted here , leaving us with 27 unique targets new to this paper .",
    "false positives were caused mainly by poor sky line subtraction and misidentification of the h@xmath0 line due to noise .",
    "table  [ tbl - qgp ] lists the subsequent systems found graded b or higher ( see below ) ; the index number by which they ll be referred to throughout the paper ; the sdss i d of the qso ; the plate , fiber , and mjd numbers ; the redshifts of both the qso and the foreground galaxy producing the emission lines ; and the impact parameter of the galaxy in both arcseconds and kpc .",
    "those graded b have at least 3 emission lines detected with the code with sl@xmath18 , while those graded a have four or more emission lines detected with the code at sl@xmath18 .     the remaining 550 qso spectra in dr7 that were flagged as low quality systems , and therefore unlikely to be real cases , are currently being evaluated by eye .",
    "about 1 in every 164 spectra was flagged by the program as being a potential gotoq ( 104,374 total with 635 flagged ) , with a false positive rate of about 10 to 1 .",
    "therefore , we expect to find another approximately 20 systems in the low grade regime , estimated from the above numbers and taking into account the lower quality of the spectra which are noisier than our grade a and b systems by about a factor of 2 .",
    "figure  [ fig - thumb ] shows the thumbnail tricolor composite images ( bands @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) from the sdss images for each of our 27 objects .",
    "this figure also presents the before and after psf subtracted data images .",
    "figure  [ fig - thumb-2 ] shows the thumbnail tricolor composite images for those systems with no galaxy detected in imaging .",
    "they are arranged in order of increasing ra and index number in their respective subcategories .",
    "this technique of searching for multiple galactic emission lines also successfully returned all 23 of our detected systems from paper i of this series , in which we only used the presence of the h@xmath0 line to detect visual foreground galaxies .",
    "these 23 are not repeated in this sample or this paper , but can be found in paper i. they are included in any calculation referring to the combined sample .",
    "the remaining systems were either false positives or did not have 3 emission lines with sl@xmath18 , and so are not presented here .",
    "figure  [ fig - spectra ] shows the sdss qso spectra for each target , broken into four areas .",
    "these areas highlight the regions of [ o ii]@xmath23 and ca ii h and k ; h@xmath15 and [ o iii]@xmath164960.30 , 5008.24 ; na i ; and [ n ii]@xmath166549.86 , 6585.27 , h@xmath0 , and [ s ii]@xmath166718.29 ,",
    "6732.67 respectively .     sample i was found by searching sdss dr5 ( mjd @xmath24 , whereas sample ii was found by searching sdss dr7 ( mjd @xmath25 ) .",
    "as stated above , we have found 27 unique targets in sample ii beyond those presented in sample i. of these 27 , 8 were not present in dr5 and so could not be found by our initial search for sample i ( these are marked in table  [ tbl - qgp ] ) . however , the remaining 19 in sample ii were also present in dr5 .",
    "these were not detected because they did not meet either the flux or fwhm requirement for sample i. additionally , the search employed for sample i concentrated on one strong emission line , which may have been lost in noise .",
    "however , the current multi - emission line search may have first picked up other strong lines in low - noise regions , and subsequent lines were confirmed by eye .    throughout the paper",
    ", we will be referring to several different samples of gotoqs .",
    "the h@xmath0 selected sample from york et al .",
    "( 2012 ; paper i ) will be referred to as sample i , while the sample new to this paper ( which excludes the targets from paper i ) will be sample ii .",
    "additionally , the sample found via [ o iii ] detection published by noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2010 ) will be referred to as nd10 .",
    "note that sample i was found from sdss dr5 , while sample ii was found from sdss dr7 .",
    "table  [ tbl - sample ] details the criteria of each of these samples .    between samples",
    "i and ii , we have a total of 50 targets . of these 50 , 23 were also found independently by nd10 .",
    "this leaves 27 unique results to our total sample .",
    "of those 23 found in nd10 that we did not find in either sample i or ii , 17 had redshifts higher than @xmath26 , and so we could not have detected them with our search due to our h@xmath0 emission requirement .",
    "the other 6 targets not detected in our search but detected in nd10 are within our redshift range , however , only q1329 + 6304 ( @xmath27 ) has undetectable h@xmath0 .",
    "these systems were not detectable because their emission lines were too few or not significant enough ( not sl@xmath18 ) by our criteria , or fell within noisy spectra which obscured the signal .",
    "we note that the comparison between these two samples indicates our search is only less than 90% complete , estimated from the targets found by nd10 that we have missed",
    ". we will discuss these [ o iii ] detected objects in a subsequent paper .",
    "anywhere sample i or ii is referred to , we have included those objects from nd10 that overlap with these samples because they were detected through independent means by our group .",
    "sources of sample bias are sky line residuals and other strong emission lines that may make it difficult to detect the galactic emission lines we seek .",
    "when strong emission lines occur near galactic emission lines , they can sometimes be misidentified as a second occurrence of the detected galactic line .",
    "this occurs because our emission template allows for 5   of uncertainty in the position of each line , a window that , although small , can sometimes include more than one line .",
    "these misidentifications occur primarily with the [ o  iii ] lines , most often in the absence of h@xmath0 , and are easily identified by eye for separate consideration .",
    "we expect the same unbiased nature in this qso sample as in paper i , as the selection criteria are similar , but with additional emission lines .",
    "that is , we expect no bias in detecting qsos due to reddening . in principle",
    ", it is harder to detect emission lines near bright qsos .",
    "however , very bright qsos ( m@xmath28 ) are very rare .",
    "additionally , the detection limit in flux is not as high when the qsos are brighter , but strong galaxy emission lines can still be seen , allowing detections towards these objects ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "there are a few cases with emission lines too weak or too few to be flagged by our program as positive detections , but upon investigation by eye we find them to be real .",
    "discussion of these systems is deferred to a later paper .",
    "sdss images have already been reduced .",
    "bias subtraction , dark correction , and flat fielding have all been applied through the sdss reduction pipeline as presented on the website at the time of each data release , so no further image reduction steps were applied by the authors . however",
    ", we have performed psf subtraction on the qso of interest in each of the fields , which is not performed by sdss prior to sdss measurements if the galaxy and qso are not resolved ( this is the case for nearly all of our targets ) .",
    "the removal of the qso allows us to measure the photometric properties of the removed qso and the remaining emission galaxy separately , without overlapping flux from either .",
    "appropriate stars were chosen from within the same field as the qso to act as our psf stars .",
    "the software program idp3 ( image display paradigm 3 ; stobie & ferro 2006 ) was used to calculate the psf subtraction by minimizing the variance . in some cases ,",
    "the psf subtraction was imperfect , leaving some residuals at the position of the qso .",
    "analysis of these residuals indicates that they are not significant , being @xmath29 in the noise .",
    "table  [ tbl - qgp ] details the offsets and impact parameter from the qso .",
    "we then used the iraf package phot to perform the photometric measurements on the galaxy .",
    "all measurements have been made on the deconvolved images .",
    "measurements of the qso were accomplished by knowing the flux scale between the qso and the psf defining stars and the total flux of the psf star itself . reported apparent magnitudes are the asinh magnitudes as defined by stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and as presented on the sdss website .",
    "table  [ tbl - phot - qsos ] details the magnitudes calculated for the qsos in filters @xmath30 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "table  [ tbl - phot - galaxies ] details the magnitudes and luminosities for the galaxies in these same four filters . also presented in table",
    "[ tbl - phot - qsos ] is the @xmath21-band psf magnitude model fit to the qso by sdss .",
    "however , the sdss pipeline does not distinguish between the galaxy and qso in nearly all cases , and so does not remove the galaxy light prior to photometric measurements of the qso ( thus skewing the measurements of the qso ) .",
    "we include the psf magnitude as a comparison to our own psf subtracted magnitudes to show the difference and improvement .",
    "additionally , the petrosian radius for each qso is provided .",
    "the petrosian ( angular ) radius is defined such that the ratio of the local surface brightness averaged over an annulus between 0.8@xmath31 and 1.25@xmath32 to the mean surface brightness within @xmath32 equals 0.2 .",
    "values of @xmath32 larger than about 1.4@xmath33 indicate profiles that deviate from a point source . this could be an indicator of a galaxy s presence even if such a galaxy could not be seen and measured .",
    "all fields in our sample but those with indices 1 , 2 , 6 , 13 , 17 , 21 , and 27 had petrosian radii @xmath34 . of these , only 1 , 13 , and 27 are also lacking absorption feature detections .    we have also calculated the dust reddening estimates for the qsos and galaxies . we have used milky way extinction corrected qso and galaxy colors . the observer - frame color excess ( @xmath35(g - i ) ) is calculated by taking the color difference ( g - i ) for the qso and comparing it to the median ( g - i ) for qsos at the same redshift , taken from schneider et al . ( 2007 ) .",
    "these median values are measured from the schneider sdss dr5 qso catalogue .",
    "this value allows us to estimate the reddening of the qso due to dust in the intervening galaxy .",
    "additionally , from this @xmath35(g - i ) value , we have calculated the e(b - v ) value , which is the absorber rest - frame color excess . from york",
    "( 2006 ) :    @xmath36    table  [ tbl - phot - qsos ] details the color and reddening estimates for each of the pairs .",
    "each of the nine previously mentioned emission lines found in the spectra were measured with the splot task within iraf ( where detected ) .",
    "determined flux values can be found in table  [ tbl - emission ] measured in 10@xmath37 erg @xmath38 s@xmath5 .",
    "we use vacuum wavelengths given in angstroms .",
    "error values are determined by measuring the standard deviation in a featureless region of the continuum near the emission line , and scaling that by the square root of the number of pixels occupied by the emission line .",
    "additional spectral inferences include star formation rate ( sfr ) , balmer decrement reddening correction , and balmer decrement reddening values .",
    "star formation rates were calculated using the prescription of kennicutt ( 1998 ) :    @xmath39    @xmath40 } ~(m_{\\sun } ~yr^{-1 } ) = 1.4\\times10^{-41 } ~l([o ii ] ) ~(erg ~s^{-1})\\ ] ]    from the h@xmath0/h@xmath15 flux values ( also found in table  [ tbl - sfr ] ) , we can calculate the reddening as for the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction curve :    @xmath41    with k(h@xmath0 ) and k(h@xmath15 ) taken from pei ( 1992 ) .",
    "we report the balmer decrement corrected and uncorrected sfrs in table  [ tbl - sfr ] .",
    "the balmer decrement corrected and uncorrected sfrs calculated from these equations and listed in the table can be taken as a lower limit , as it is possible a part of the galaxy area falls outside the spectral fiber .",
    "a full discussion of these measurements can be found below .",
    "for the combined sample i@xmath42ii , the median galaxy ( u - r ) value is 1.30 , whereas the mean is 1.21 . for sample ii ( those objects reported in this paper ) , we find the median to be 1.05 with a mean of 1.07 . it can be seen that our sample falls directly in the range of late - type galaxies ( u - r@xmath22.22 ) , which is perhaps unsurprising given that we have selected our targets based on emission .",
    "the largest values for the combined sample are 2.25 and 2.64 ( targets number 4 and 5 ) , the only two values to fall within the early - type range ( above 2.22 ; strateva et al .",
    "these targets could be good candidates for green valley blue ellipticals or red spirals ( bell et al .",
    "2004 , jaffe et al .",
    "2011 , masters et al . 2011 ) .",
    "table [ tbl - small - ii ] summarizes the small number statistics for each sample individually and the combined sample for all our measurement categories reported in the text .",
    "that is , ( u - r ) , @xmath35(g - i ) , e(b - v)@xmath3 , h@xmath0/h@xmath15 , e(b - v)@xmath43 , and sfr ( h@xmath0 ) .",
    "many of our galaxies are very faint , with m@xmath44 .",
    "those systems that do not have imaging detections have @xmath21-band limits of m@xmath45 ( similarly for m@xmath46 ) . while many targeted galaxy surveys go deep enough to detect objects of these magnitudes ( reaching limits of i@xmath47 in some cases ; i.e. , cosmos , gems , and goods ) , many of the galaxies presented here are small enough in size to be blended with the background qso ( 17/23 in sample i and 18/27 in sample ii  over half of the entire sample ) .",
    "thus many surveys would classify these systems as qsos and stars .",
    "therefore , their presence would be missed except for their spectral emission present in qso spectra .",
    "additionally , surveys such as the sdss can not resolve and individually measure overlapping targets such as these ( unless the galaxy is at a higher impact parameter ) .",
    "therefore , automated detections of galaxies in imaging can be difficult , even if they are luminous , and detections and measurements by eye prohibitively time consuming .",
    "the detection of these galaxies , which might otherwise be completely overlooked , by emission in qso spectra is a unique and robust method .",
    "however , their presence being now known , they are detectable by deep targeted observations . traditionally , imaging surveys are biased towards the largest and brightest galaxies .",
    "qsoals are unique in that they avoid this bias . our sample selection is not based on imaging , but on spectral emission , which can also trace those galaxies that are otherwise difficult to detect in imaging ( with constraints on redshift ) .",
    "table  [ tbl - phot - galaxies ] lists the magnitudes , magnitude limits , luminosities in four optical filters , and ( u - r ) values for all of our galaxy targets .",
    "figure  [ fig - ebv ] shows an e(b - v)@xmath3 histogram of the combined sample i@xmath42ii by number in addition to the histogram for sample ii alone ( shown by the dashed line ) .",
    "statistically , the center of the distribution is offset from 0 , indicating that on average qsos with foreground galaxies are more reddened than the average qso sample .",
    "however , in any one case , we can not separate systems with real extinction from error .",

    "this broadening is most likely caused by the error introduced in the deconvolution of the qso from the galaxy , which is not a factor in samples of qsos without intervening galaxies .",
    "intrinsic color variations have not been taken into account .",
