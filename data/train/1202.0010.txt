    "the early stages of star formation at redshift @xmath0 are being probed by a growing number of observations .",
    "lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) surveys are taking advantage of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , pushing the frontier of galaxy detection to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there are now samples of several thousand galaxies at @xmath14 @xcite , and more than 100 galaxies at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "narrow - band observations discovered large samples of ly@xmath16 emitter galaxies at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "large - area , ground - based surveys are detecting qsos at @xmath18 @xcite , shedding light on the formation of the first super - massive black holes .",
    "gamma - ray - burst ( grb ) observations with _ swift _ have detected the object with the highest spectroscopically robust redshift ( @xmath19 ; @xcite ) and a photometric candidate at @xmath20 @xcite , providing an independent probe of the star formation rate ( sfr ) during the epoch of hydrogen reionization @xcite . at the same time , numerical simulations and theoretical modeling are addressing the formation of stars and galaxies within the first billion years with increasingly successful predictions @xcite .    despite this progress , many open questions on early star formation remain .",
    "in fact , we do not know with confidence when ionization was completed or sources responsible for it .",
    "the wmap - inferred epoch of cosmic reionization ( @xmath21 ; @xcite ) is somewhat in tension with galaxy observations that suggest that reionization extended to lower redshift ( @xmath18 ) , based on evolution of the lae luminosity function @xcite .",
    "in addition , the photon budget from observed galaxies at @xmath22 falls short of that required to produce the optical depth to reionization measured by wmap @xcite .",
    "a possible solution is that there is significant star formation in small galaxies with luminosity below @xmath23 , the current limit for deep lbg surveys at @xmath24 .",
    "the faint - end slope of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is very steep , @xmath25 in the @xcite form , with @xmath26 .",
    "because observed lbgs live in massive dark - matter halos ( @xmath27 ) , most of the @xmath24 star formation could take place in smaller halos that host dwarf - like galaxies , with luminosity in the range @xmath28 .",
    "this corresponds to the limit of ly@xmath16-cooling halos ( virial temperature @xmath1 and @xmath29 ) , in broad agreement with theoretical modeling @xcite .",
    "the prediction that faint dwarfs are the main agents of reionization is difficult to test observationally .",
    "even the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ will be unable to reach the required sensitivity , as it will only improve the sensitivity by @xmath30 compared to hst / wfc3 @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "grb observations offer an independent probe of the total sfr , unlimited by the faintness of the host galaxy and well suited to investigate star formation during the epoch of reionization .",
    "indeed , grb rates suggest that the total sfr at @xmath31 is larger than that inferred from lbg observations and the difference arises because most of the star formation happens in small galaxies @xcite .",
    "still , deriving the sfr from grb observations is challenging , both because of the small number ( @xmath32 ) of @xmath33 grb events with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts and because detailed modeling is required to translate the grb rates into a sfr . in this respect , both selection and follow - up biases might be important . for example , grbs with dusty sight lines will be under - represented @xcite , and possibly grbs with faint afterglows as well , depending on the inhomogeneous follow - up data available .",
    "following @xcite , the typical modeling assumes that the comoving grb rate is related to the sfr by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the efficiency of grb production per unit stellar mass , with a redshift dependence that can be used to model biases in the relation between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this quantity is often modeled as : @xmath38 with @xmath39 derived empirically at @xmath40 and extrapolated to higher redshift to infer @xmath41 ( @xcite ) .    to complement existing studies ,",
    "we propose a novel idea for testing the relation between sfrs from grb and lbg surveys and for investigating whether @xmath42 remains constant at @xmath33 .",
    "we suggest measuring the fraction of grb hosts detected from observations reaching the same magnitude limit as the typical lbg galaxy search . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we show that this fraction quantifies the amount of star formation missed in lbg surveys , elucidating the minimum luminosity ( and halo masses ) of galaxies in the epoch of reionization .",
    "measuring grb - host detection efficiency at different redshifts also constrains @xmath42 . in section  [ sec : predictions ] we consider the prospects for carrying out our proposed measure and show a preliminary application of our method to recent _ hst _ observations by @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : con ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "both lbg and grb surveys provide estimates of the sfr : from the observed galaxy light in the first case , and from the observed grb rate in the second . both approaches rely on modeling assumptions , such as completeness estimates , dust extinction / obscuration , initial mass function ( imf ) , age and metallicity of the stellar populations .",
    "therefore , a discrepancy between the two estimates can either have a physical or a systematic origin . in figure  [",
    "fig : sfr ] , we report the latest determination of the lbg - sfr from @xcite and the grb - inferred sfr from @xcite and @xcite . the dust - corrected lbg sfr has been derived for galaxies with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , the approximate limit of the @xcite observations .",
    "it is immediately clear that the grb sfr is systematically above the lbg sfr .",
    "a possible explanation for the difference is that there is significant star formation in galaxies with @xmath45 @xcite . to illustrate this , we plot in figure  [ fig : sfr ] the sfr inferred from the luminosity function model of @xcite , calibrated on the @xmath46 luminosity function ( lf ) with the latest dust correction applied by @xcite .",
    "this model is based on relating the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function to that of the dark - matter halo mass function via a modified abundance matching and results in lbg lfs that are close to a schechter form and match the observation well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we show two model predictions with different assumptions on the luminosity below which galaxy formation is suppressed : @xmath47 ( solid - black line ) and @xmath48 ( dashed - green line ) .",
    "the higher limit corresponds to the limit of the @xcite observations , demonstrating that the model successfully reproduces the evolution of the lbg lf from @xmath49 to @xmath50 ( the model assumptions are not appropriate for @xmath51 ) .",
    "the lower limit assumes that star formation proceeds in dm halos with smaller mass compared to that of the _ hubble _ ultradeep field galaxies , down to the limit of ly@xmath16 cooling ( @xmath52 ) . in most models of galaxy formation , these small halos are capable of cooling and forming stars , which are included in the grb - derived sfr .",
    "the model prediction ( figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) is in agreement with the data within their uncertainty .",
    "another explanation for the difference in the observed sfrs is the possibility of systematic errors .",
    "for example , the redshift evolution of the grb production efficiency @xmath35 may differ from the @xmath53 derived from @xmath40 data .",
    "to investigate which of the two hypotheses is correct , we introduce the idea of using the information contained in the fraction of grb hosts detected at a given redshift .    to present our framework , we assume for simplicity that the stellar mass - to - light ratio does not depend on galaxy luminosity , and that the grb rate is proportional to the sfr , with no bias depending on host - galaxy luminosity .",
    "we assume that galaxy properties such as metallicity , dust content and imf do not depend on @xmath54 at a given redshift , but equation  [ eq : grb_rate ] includes redshift evolution of these properties for the relation grb rate and the sfr .",
    "this framework is equivalent to that of previous grb studies such as @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the nearby ( @xmath55 ) grb sample suggest that these events may be biased towards lower - mass galaxies ( @xcite ) , possibly a result of either the standard mass - metallicity relation for star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the fundamental metallicity relation @xcite . the physical phenomenon driving this apparent bias",
    "is not yet well understood ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    "if the bias is related to a metallicity dependence , it should become less important at high redshift @xcite .",
    "these unknown factors that relate @xmath36 to @xmath37 complicate the use of grbs as tracers of sfr , however our analysis framework can be generalized to include a luminosity / metallicity - dependent efficiency .    for lbg",
    ", we start by defining the integrated light above a given luminosity @xmath54 as : @xmath56 from this , the relation with the sfr follows as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the conversion factor from observed luminosity density to star formation rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation rate in galaxies with @xmath6 is thus given as : @xmath59 sfr estimators from grbs ( probing all sites of star formation ) and lbgs ( with observations at @xmath6 ) can be derived assuming models for @xmath35 and @xmath58 .",
    "we indicate these estimators as @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the detected fraction of grbs with host galaxies of luminosity @xmath6 at redshift @xmath62 is : @xmath63 assuming that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are unbiased estimators , we can rewrite equation  [ eq : fdet_intr ] as : @xmath64 the fraction @xmath5 allows us to measure the relative amount of star formation in galaxies below the detection threshold of the observations ( equation  [ eq : fdet_intr ] ) .",
    "in fact , under the assumption that there is no luminosity dependence on the efficiency , grbs are unbiased tracers of star formation at a given redshift .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of detected hosts gives the relative amount of star formation present below @xmath65 , independent of the specific value of @xmath35 and @xmath58 .",
    "from @xmath5 it is therefore immediate to derive the integrated luminosity function at @xmath66 .    to illustrate typical expected detection fractions of high-@xmath62 grb hosts as a function of redshift and survey depth , we show in figure  [ fig : fhost_vs_mlim ] the predictions derived from our lf model , assuming @xmath48 .",
    "observations at the hudf depth ( @xmath67 ) are expected to detect @xmath68 of the grb host halos at @xmath69 , but this fraction should decrease rapidly at higher redshift . although we resorted to a specific luminosity function model to illustrate expected results ,",
    "the relation in equation  [ eq : fdet_intr ] is not model - dependent .",
    "hence , the observational determination of @xmath70 represents a powerful test to determine the amount of star formation below the sensitivity of lbg surveys .    with a model lf ,",
    "it is also possible to go beyond the determination of the integrated luminosity function at @xmath66 and use @xmath70 to constrain the luminosity scale at which galaxy formation is suppressed and provide a test of galaxy formation theories and simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fhost_vs_msuppr ] shows our model predictions for a shallow ( @xmath71 ) and deep ( @xmath67 ) survey as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "ideally , one would search for grb host galaxies at @xmath9 , where @xmath70 is most sensitive to changes in @xmath72 .",
    "however , by using the larger sample of known grbs at @xmath73 , it is also possible to constrain @xmath72 immediately after the epoch of reionization , as discussed in section  [ sec : predictions ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 provides a consistency check of the model assumptions that lead to the determination of @xmath61 and @xmath60 .",
    "the grb efficiency @xmath35 is commonly described by equation  [ eq : varepsilon ] .",
    "therefore , equation  [ eq : fdet ] can be used to derive @xmath42 .",
    "for example , if @xmath74 at @xmath75 [ as suggested by the fact that @xmath76 , and assuming that we have @xmath77 at @xmath78 , then it follows that @xmath79 .",
    "from this , we derive : @xmath80",
    "so far , studies of grb - host galaxies have been primarily limited to @xmath40 and are based on heterogeneous observations . adopting a compiled sample of 18 grb hosts at @xmath55 from @xcite and @xcite , we find that nearby _ detected _ hosts have @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that grb hosts at @xmath82 occur preferentially in small , relatively low - mass galaxies .",
    "@xcite compile a larger sample of 45 grbs at @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , again for detected hosts , as their catalog does not include grbs for which only upper photometric limits are available .",
    "a systematic search of host galaxies at low redshift would help to calibrate @xmath35 and construct the basis for comparison with future detections of @xmath33 hosts at rest - frame uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "the main problem currently is the limited sample size : there are only 19 grbs spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath33 and only three at @xmath9 .",
    "while this _ letter _ was under review , upper limits on host galaxy luminosities for a sample of six @xmath10 grbs observed with _",
    "hst _ have been derived by @xcite .",
    "still , a comprehensive effort to detect these high-@xmath62 hosts is missing .    as proved by the @xcite sample , a systematic search is now feasible for host galaxies in all known @xmath33 grb to a magnitude limit @xmath23 . using the _ hubble _ exposure time calculator ,",
    "we estimate that @xmath85 of integration time with wfc3 in @xmath86 will reach a @xmath87 limit of @xmath88 within a diameter @xmath89 , corresponding to @xmath90 , with a weak dependence on the grb redshift .",
    "compared to lbg surveys , a grb - host survey has the key advantage that the position of the source is known _ a priori_.",
    "therefore , detections at a lower signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath91 ) are still statistically significant . based on the surface density of sources in the _ hubble _ ultradeep field survey @xcite",
    ", the chance of line - of - sight superposition with a foreground faint source is low .",
    "however , data in a second band blueward of the expected lyman break would be useful to confirm that detected hosts are at the grb redshift .",
    "ground - based observations using 10m - class telescopes with sensitivity comparable to _ hst _ in the v and i bands , provide a suitable alternative to search for @xmath69 hosts and/or for deep observations in the second band ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    from our galaxy lf model , we expect @xmath92 at @xmath7 depending on @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , a grb host survey would be expected to detect @xmath93 host galaxies at @xmath94 .",
    "this will measure @xmath70 to @xmath95 accuracy , which will be sufficient to determine whether @xmath72 is above or below @xmath96 to high confidence level . to illustrate that this is a feasible goal , we analyze in our framework the set of upper limits @xmath97 ( with @xmath98 ) on host galaxy luminosity derived for the @xmath10 grbs sample in table  2 of @xcite . with those limits we construct the probability of null detection in their sample as a function of the @xmath72 deriving @xmath70 from our lf model ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) : @xmath99.\\ ] ]",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : tanvir_analysis ] and demonstrate that the absence of detected hosts constrains @xmath100 at 95% confidence ( and @xmath101 at 99% confidence ) .",
    "this result is already a significant improvement upon the limits inferred from current lbg surveys alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this technique also outperforms limits that can be obtained in future lbg surveys with _ jwst _ , which will reach @xmath102 ( however , _ jwst _ will improve dramatically the efficiency of the search for grb hosts ) . in the future , additional detections of grbs at @xmath103 would best distinguish between models with different suppression magnitudes , because @xmath104 is very sensitive to this quantity ( see figure  [ fig : fhost_vs_msuppr ] ) .",
    "in this _ letter _ we discuss the relation between sfr estimates from grb and lbg surveys . the grb - inferred rate is higher than that of lbgs at @xmath33 ( see figure  [ fig : sfr ] ) , suggesting that significant star formation takes place in galaxies below the lbg detection limit .",
    "the difference between the two approaches can be qualitatively explained by the model of galaxy formation based on the dark - matter halo evolution developed by @xcite , under the assumption that star formation proceeds down to the limit of h  i cooling ( @xmath105 or @xmath29 ) . in this model ,",
    "the assembly of galaxies is linked to the growth of their dark - matter halos . by construction ,",
    "our model is consistent with the build - up of stellar mass density , unaffected by the over - production of stellar mass at @xmath106 inferred from the grb - sfr by @xcite . in this respect , it is interesting that our sfr predictions in figure  [ fig : sfr ] are systematically @xmath107 lower than the datapoints from grb observations .",
    "our findings suggest a mild systematic over - estimation of the sfr derived from grbs at @xmath33 , as concluded by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "to gain further insight on the relation between the sfr estimates from grb and lbg surveys , we introduced the idea that the fraction @xmath5 of detected grb hosts in a survey with @xmath6 provides an unbiased estimator of star formation .",
    "the relative amount of star formation in undetected faint galaxies ( equation  [ eq : fdet_intr ] ) can quantity the role played by galaxies during hydrogen ionization . starting from @xmath5 and using a lf model , it is possible to determine the scale at which galaxy formation is suppressed at low masses .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 can be used to measure variations with redshift in the evolution of the grb efficiency per unit stellar mass ( equations  [ eq : grb_rate ] and [ eq : beta ] ) , a key quantity to understand the production of grbs across cosmic time .    based on our specific galaxy formation model , we made predictions of the expected detection fraction of grb hosts at high-@xmath62 ( figures  [ fig : fhost_vs_mlim]-[fig : fhost_vs_msuppr ] ) .",
    "we expect that @xmath108 of the grb hosts could be detected at @xmath7 , followed by a sharp drop at higher redshift because of a steep faint - end slope of the galaxy lf . in general , the more that star formation is dominated by low - mass , low - luminosity halos , the smaller the detected host fraction .",
    "our modeling is consistent with the non - detection of grb hosts for the six highest - redshift grbs known to date @xcite .",
    "the analysis of their limits in our framework allows us to constrain @xmath100 at 95% confidence ( and @xmath101 at 99% confidence ) , demonstrating that the majority of ionizing photons at @xmath24 were produced in small , low - luminosity galaxies . a systematic search for grb hosts down to faint luminosity limits ( @xmath23 ) for all known @xmath109 grbs would improve the limits on @xmath72 and could provide the definitive proof that the faintest galaxies are the agents of hydrogen reionization .",
