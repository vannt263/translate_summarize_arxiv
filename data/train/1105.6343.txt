    "magnetic reconnection is one of the most important processes in plasma physics .",
    "it appears in a variety of phenomena in geo / astrophysics and fusion physics , which include dynamo , solar and stellar flares , magnetospheric substorms , disruptions in fusion devices , etc . in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , the diffusion of magnetic field in magnetic reconnection can be described with a basic model proposed by sweet@xcite and parker,@xcite where conservations of the magnetic flux , mass , and momentum are considered .",
    "however , sweet ",
    "parker mechanism of reconnection is too slow to explain typical time scales of eruptive processes observed in laboratory and in space such as solar flares . in order to alleviate this discrepancy due to the slowness of reconnection ,",
    "several theoretical attempts for the fast reconnection , including the petschek s model,@xcite have been proposed .",
    "turbulence is one of the candidate mechanisms that enhance the reconnection rate very much .",
    "turbulence in magnetic reconnection has been investigated by several researchers .",
    "analysis of magnetic - field observations in the earth s magnetotail suggested the reconnection process in the current sheet has properties of turbulence excited by tearing vortices.@xcite the effects of turbulence on magnetic reconnection were first investigated by matthaeus and lamkin using numerical simulations of pinch sheet .",
    "they showed that the electric fluctuations combined with the flow and current filament enhance the dissipation in the reconnection zone , and leads to the rapid reconnection.@xcite in order to dissolve the discrepancy between the typical length scale of phenomena and the dimension required for the current sheet , a fractal nature of the current sheet was suggested.@xcite lazarian and vishniac examined the effects of stochastic field in reconnection and concluded that the presence of the stochastic components of the magnetic field enhances the reconnection rate drastically .",
    "they stressed that turbulence alters the relevant scales for reconnection almost independently of the microscopic dissipation mechanisms.@xcite    one of the primary effects of turbulence is enhancing the mixing or transport of the system , which is represented by the notion of turbulent transport such as the eddy viscosity , eddy diffusivity , anomalous resistivity , etc .",
    "for example , in the mean momentum equation in a turbulent flow , the eddy viscosity @xmath0 enhances the effect of molecular viscosity @xmath1 as @xmath2 with spatiotemporal variation of @xmath0 .",
    "the enhanced transport due to turbulence leads to destruction of structure or reduction of spatiotemporal inhomogeneity . in the real - world phenomena , however , roles of turbulence are not so obvious or straightforward . under some circumstances ,",
    "a large - scale inhomogeneous structure is formed or sustained by turbulence itself .",
    "representative situations are seen in turbulent dynamos , where large - scale magnetic fields are generated by some statistical properties of turbulent motion.@xcite this can be regarded as an example of general situations where breakage of symmetry leads to the formation or sustainment of large - scale inhomogeneous structure in turbulence . in the presence of symmetry breakage in turbulence , we may expect some effects that balance or counteract the primary turbulence effects . here , enhanced transports due to turbulence are suppressed , and large - scale inhomogeneous structures are sustained or formed .",
    "important question is how to formulate such breakage of symmetry in turbulence which leads to the structure formation .",
    "most straightforward method for describing turbulent motions is to directly solve governing equations .",
    "however , for realistic turbulence of scientific interests with a huge reynolds number , it is impossible in the foreseeable future to numerically solve all scales of motions ranging from the largest scales of system size to the smallest scales where the energy is dissipated into heat . in such a situation , modeling of turbulent motions provides a useful tool for investigating realistic turbulence . in practice of studying turbulence phenomena that appear in the geo / astrophysical and fusion sciences , one of the important tasks is how to choose quantities that appropriately describe the statistical properties of turbulence .    in the studies of turbulence modeling , among several statistical quantities , the turbulent energy density ( per unit mass ) @xmath3 and its dissipation rate @xmath4 $ ] have often been adopted as descriptors of turbulence properties ( @xmath5 : velocity fluctuation , @xmath1 : kinematic viscosity).@xcite the turbulent energy @xmath6 expresses how much fluctuation a turbulent flow has , and the energy dissipation rate @xmath7 expresses how much energy is transferred from large to small scales . in this sense , both @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the _ intensity _ property of turbulence .",
    "the eddy - viscosity representation is supplemented by a model of @xmath0 whose generic form is expressed by _ intensity _",
    "measures of turbulence as @xmath8 .",
    "the most popular expression is @xmath9 ( @xmath10 : model constant , @xmath11 : time scale of turbulence ) .",
    "however , it is well known in the engineering field that such a simple eddy - viscosity model completely fails if applied to some turbulent flows .",
    "the turbulent swirling flow is the representative case .",
    "a simple eddy - viscosity model is too dissipative to sustain the centerline dent profile of axial mean velocity that is experimentally observed in the turbulent swirling flow.@xcite in order to alleviate this discrepancy , anomalously small value of @xmath10 has often been adopted in the numerical simulations.@xcite this fact implies that the description based on @xmath6 and @xmath7 is not enough and we have to take into account another turbulent statistical quantity that properly describes the _ structure _ property or breakage of mirrorsymmetry in the turbulent swirling pipe flow.@xcite    large - scale rotation and magnetic field are often essential ingredients in the geo / astrophysical and fusion plasma phenomena .",
    "if we have large - scale rotational motion or magnetic field , symmetry of turbulence between the directions parallel and antiparallel to the rotation axis or magnetic field is broken .",
    "such breakage of mirrorsymmetry is expected to be measured by pseudoscalar turbulent quantities , which change their sign under the inversion of the coordinate system .",
    "since pseudoscalar vanishes in a mirrorsymmetric system , a finite value of pseudoscalar indicates the breakage of mirrorsymmetry .    the turbulent cross helicity is a pseudoscalar which represents breakage of mirrorsymmetry , more precisely , asymmetry between the directions parallel and antiparallel to the large - scale magnetic field . in the presence of breakage of mirrorsymmetry in turbulence ,",
    "the primary transports due to turbulence may be suppressed by the cross - helicity effects , and large - scale structures are formed and sustained even in the presence of a strong turbulence .",
    "these two effects : ( i ) generation of large - scale structures ; and ( ii ) suppression of turbulent transport ; are two sides of the same coin , the cross - helicity effect . unlike the kinetic and magnetic helicities , the cross helicity can exist even in two dimensional configuration of magnetohydrodynamic plasmas . for physical interpretation of the cross - helicity effect and its application to the dynamo problems ,",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "behavior of turbulent statistical quantities relevant to the transport coefficients provides essential information on the evolution of the large - scale structures . at the same time ,",
    "how turbulent statistical quantities are spatially distributed and temporally evolve is determined by large - scale flow and magnetic - field structures or mean - field inhomogeneities .",
    "as is well known , the mean - velocity shear coupled with the reynolds stress,@xmath12 , is the main cause for the turbulence production in a hydrodynamic ( hd ) flow . in the mhd turbulent flow , as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , we have several mean - field inhomogeneities other than the mean velocity shear , which may contribute to the energy and cross - helicity generations .",
    "large - scale structures , which can be denoted in the broad sense as _ flow _ including the mean flow and global magnetic field , etc . , are determined by _ turbulence _ through the turbulent transport coefficients . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig : flow_turbulence ] .     flow  turbulence relationship .",
    "mean - field structures are determined by turbulence through the turbulent transport coefficients .",
    "turbulence properties are determined by mean - field structures through the production rates of turbulent statistical quantities . ]    if we see the magnetic reconnection phenomena from this perspective , important points are as follows .",
    "magnetic reconnection is considered to be promoted by the enhanced magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence .",
    "if the spatiotemporal distributions of the turbulent statistical quantities ( turbulent energy , cross helicity , etc . ) relevant to the turbulent transports are favorable for the magnetic reconnection , the rate of reconnection would be increased .",
    "the spatiotemporal distributions of these turbulent quantities obey the balance of the production , dissipation , and transport rates of these statistical quantities .",
    "the production mechanism , the most important ingredient , is determined by the large - scale flow structures such as the inflow profiles , global magnetic - field configurations , etc .",
    "if the large - scale structures sustained and formed during the magnetic reconnection process are consistent with the favorable distributions of the transport coefficients for the magnetic reconnection , the reconnection would be promoted . otherwise , the reconnection rate should be reduced .",
    "therefore , it is the production mechanism of the turbulent statistical quantities due to large - scale structures that should be examined intensively . in this paper",
    ", we focus our attention on the turbulent cross - helicity effects , and address the magnetic reconnection from the viewpoint of the mutual relationship between the flow structure and turbulence mediated by the cross helicity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
