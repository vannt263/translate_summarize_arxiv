    "cosmic inflation  @xcite has been the cornerstone beyond the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "it makes the present observable universe homogeneous and isotropic on large scales and gives rise to the primordial perturbations  @xcite .",
    "these primordial perturbations , when reentering the horizon after inflation , become the seed for the subsequent structure formation that leads to the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and the inhomogeneous distribution of galaxies .",
    "they are very well constrained by observations to follow gaussian statistics and to give nearly scale invariant power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "although there have been many proposals for inflation models consistent with observations  @xcite , it seems hard to distinguish between different models from the current observations .",
    "as we are getting more precise cosmological data from the ongoing and future experiments , e.g. from the planck satellite  @xcite , we will be able to constrain the models of inflation beyond gaussianity and power spectrum in next few years .",
    "especially , the possibility of observing primordial non - gaussianity from inflation has recently drawn a lot of attention from both cosmologists and particle physicists  @xcite .",
    "since most slow - roll inflation models predict negligible non - gaussianity  @xcite , the detection or null - detection of non - gaussianity will be an important discriminator for inflation models .",
    "the inflation models with non - minimal couplings  @xcite have been receiving a renewed interest from the recent claim that the standard model ( sm ) higgs field can support inflation provided that it is non - minimally coupled to gravity  @xcite .",
    "the merit of the higgs inflation consists in the minimality that the inflaton is the higgs boson in the sm with a single additional parameter , the non - minimal coupling of the higgs doublet .",
    "however , matching to the cobe normalization for the resulting density perturbation , one needs a large non - minimal coupling , given that the higgs self - coupling appears large to be consistent with the higgs mass bound at lep  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the large non - minimal coupling gives rise to a unitarity problem in the gauge boson scatterings of the sm  @xcite so the perturbative expansion breaks down at unitarity scale without adding extra degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the predictions of the higgs inflation may be maintained due to the field - dependent unitarity cutoff  @xcite and/or depending on a ultraviolet completion  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the higgs inflation seems to remain as an interesting proposal .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a simple two - field inflation model with a complex scalar field .",
    "we assume that the non - minimal coupling is not large such that there is no unitarity scale much below the planck scale .",
    "the potential of the modulus of the complex scalar becomes flat at large field value due to the non - minimal coupling .",
    "moreover , a small breaking of the global @xmath0 symmetry gives rise to a flat potential for the angular mode of the complex scalar too . on the other hand ,",
    "the slow - roll parameters of the angular mode remain small during inflation such that the slow - roll conditions for the angular mode are always satisfied . at horizon",
    "crossing , the vacuum expectation value of the modulus is chosen to obtain the required number of @xmath1-folds while that of the angular mode is set in such a way that it gives a negligible contribution to the slow - roll parameter @xmath2 . very interestingly ,",
    "we show that a sizable contribution of the angular mode to @xmath2 at the end of inflation leads to non - gaussianity large enough to be detected .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we first present the inflation model with a complex scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity and show how two - field inflation is possible .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : pert ] we analysis the perturbations during inflation using the @xmath3 formalism  @xcite and compute the non - linear parameter @xmath4 as well as the power spectrum @xmath5 and the spectral index @xmath6 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conc ] conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider the general action for a complex scalar field @xmath7 with dimension-4 interactions in the jordan frame , @xmath8 here we note that @xmath9 and @xmath10 respect the @xmath0 global symmetry while @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not . for simplicity , we choose all the dimensionless couplings to be real .",
    "then , the unbounded below constraints give @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    writing the complex field @xmath7 in terms of two real fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 the original action ( [ jf_action ] ) becomes @xmath20r - \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu h)^2 - \\frac{h^2}{2f^2}(\\partial_\\mu\\chi)^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & - \\frac{1}{4}\\lambda h^4 - \\frac{1}{4}\\kappa h^4\\cos\\left ( \\frac{2\\chi}{f } \\right ) - \\frac{1}{4}\\zeta h^4\\cos\\left ( \\frac{4\\chi}{f } \\right ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] changing to the einstein frame by a conformal transformation with @xmath21 we have @xmath22 ^ 2 \\right\\ } ( \\partial_\\mu h)^2 - \\frac{h^2}{2f^2\\omega^2 } \\left [ 1 + \\frac{6\\alpha^2h^2}{\\omega^2}\\sin^2\\left ( \\frac{2\\chi}{f } \\right ) \\right ] ( \\partial_\\mu\\chi)^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{6\\alpha h^3}{f\\omega^4 } \\sin\\left ( \\frac{2\\chi}{f } \\right ) \\left [ \\xi + \\alpha\\cos\\left ( \\frac{2\\chi}{f } \\right ) \\right ] \\partial^\\mu h\\partial_\\mu\\chi - \\frac{h^4}{4\\omega^4 } \\left [ \\lambda + \\kappa\\cos\\left ( \\frac{2\\chi}{f } \\right)+\\zeta \\cos\\left ( \\frac{4\\chi}{f } \\right)\\right ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , for a non - zero @xmath11 , there is a kinetic mixing between the modulus and angular directions . for large values of the modulus ,",
    "the potential becomes flat along the modulus as in higgs inflation .",
    "meanwhile , the potential for the angular direction may be too steep if the symmetry breaking terms proportional to @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are of order unity . to see this more clearly , we take the limit @xmath23 .",

    "the small @xmath0 breaking terms are technically natural in the sense that for equally small @xmath0 breaking parameters , the loop corrections to them are under control . in this case",
    ", @xmath18 can be another inflaton component .",
    "the potential for @xmath18 is of a very similar form to the inflaton potential for a codimension - two brane moving in a warped background in six dimensions  @xcite . in the brane inflation case ,",
    "inflation is assumed to end when the moving brane hits the background brane . on the other hand , in our case ,",
    "the modulus is the main inflaton component , which finishes inflation when the slow - roll condition is not satisfied any more .    from now on , for simplicity , we consider the case with @xmath27 so that the kinetic mixing is absent .",
    "also we work in the einstein frame and drop the subscript @xmath28 .",

    "therefore , we have included a small potential term for the modulus @xmath31 as well so that both the modulus and the angular directions of the complex scalar are slowly rolling . in order to canonically normalize the kinetic term for the angular direction @xmath18 during inflation , we need to choose @xmath43 , viz",
    ". the decay constant of the would - be goldstone boson is @xmath44 .",
    "this is comparable to a similar observation in higgs inflation that the gauge boson mass during inflation is of @xmath45 , which is identified with the ultraviolet cutoff during inflation  @xcite .",
    "focusing on the regime with @xmath46 , we can write the lagrangian as @xmath47 this is a particularly simple lagrangian  @xcite which has been studied in models motivated from string theory : it includes a non - canonical kinetic term with @xmath48 and a potential of product form @xmath49 with @xmath50 as will be shown later , the above product form of the potential makes it particularly easy to study two - field inflation , not only for the background evolution but also for the explicit computations of the perturbations using the @xmath51 formalism .",
    "since we are interested in the slow - roll phase of inflation , we can write the slow - roll parameters based on the potential derivatives .",
