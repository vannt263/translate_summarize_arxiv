    "decision tree algorithms have proven themselves useful as automated classifiers in a number of astronomical domains .",
    "an oblique decision tree algorithm created by murthy , kasif , & salzberg ( 1994 ) has demonstrated that decision trees can be generated to distinguish between stars and galaxies or to identify cosmic rays in space telescope images .",
    "typically , the trees produced by this algorithm possess accuracies up to and exceeding 95% , and can now be used to classify additional data @xcite . in this way , decision trees free researchers from the tedious task of object classification .",
    "the next logical step for a decision tree classification algorithm is , of course , the classification of galaxies morphologically . as storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "point out , this has been attempted by a number of researchers with limited success ; today `` morphological classification into ellipticals , lenticulars , spirals and irregulars remains a process dependent on the eyes of a handful of dedicated individuals . ''    in an attempt to rectify this situation , storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "( hereafter referred to as slss ) have applied a computing technique known as artificial neural networks ( also known as neural nets or anns ) , to the problem of galaxy classification . in particular , slss used their neural net to classify galaxies taken from the eso - lv catalog @xcite . in this paper , we compare results from the slss ann with those from decision trees .",
    "here we will describe some of the fundamental differences between the neural network algorithm implemented by slss and decision trees .",
    "our discussion will focus only on the dominant aspects of these algorithms . for more information ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to the slss paper on neural network classification @xcite . for an introduction to decision trees ,",
    "quinlan s original paper on the topic is an excellent starting point .",
    "an in - depth look at the original oblique decision tree algorithm used to generate the trees for our experiments can be found in a paper by murthy et al . .",
    "an artificial neural network consists of nodes , roughly analogous to human neurons , arranged in a series of layers .",
    "all the nodes of each layer can be fully connected to the nodes in the next .",
    "weights between nodes indicate how a series of inputs are to be transformed into output ; for example , how attributes describing an object ( input ) determine the object s classification ( output ) .",
    "`` hidden nodes '' occur between the input layer of nodes and the output layer .",
    "node weights are updated via a hill - climbing error - minimization procedure . in other words , as the neural net learns , weights are updated such that the overall accuracy of the neural net improves .    the error - minimization procedure implemented by slss",
    "is known as back - propagation .",
    "back - propagation modifies weights from the output nodes backwards to the nodes accepting input .",
    "as mentioned , weights are only altered when back - propagation improves the neural net s overall accuracy . of course , to determine overall accuracy , some kind of pre - classified data is required ( discussed below ) .",
    "the ann implemented by slss contains 13 input nodes , 13 hidden nodes , and 5 output nodes .",
    "the 5 output nodes correspond to the five target classifications the neural net has been trained to produce .",
    "a classification is based on the output node with the largest value . following a crude hubble sequence ,",
    "the five classes chosen by slss are : e , s0 , sa+sb , sc+sd , and irr .",
    "because the ann developed by slss is a supervised neural network , the ann must first be trained on some pre - classified set of data .",
    "subsets of this data were reserved and used to test the accuracy of the neural net . because the ann must first be trained ,",
    "its accuracy is wholly dependent on the accuracy of the training data .",
    "good training data is essential to the production of a good classifier .    .slss results with an ann .",
    "overall accuracy = 64.1% .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     in one last attempt to overcome the five - classification `` fuzziness '' of the data , we tried growing two new trees : one to separate e and irr - type galaxies from spirals , and another to identify the s0 , sa+sb , and sc+sd - types in the spiral subset .",
    "the result was a modest increase in accuracy to 66% .",
    "while this result could most likely have been achieved by increasing the number of random searches performed by oc1 , by initially filtering out the spirals , we were able to direct the search in a direction we wanted to explore . by reducing the search space in this manner",
    ", we also reduced processing time .",
    "finally , even though neither the decision tree nor the ann produced remarkable results , global classifications by the two differ for less than 3% of the test set .",
    "( attempts have not yet been made to determine accuracy by comparing classifications example by example . )",
    "furthermore , misclassifications made by the oblique decision tree in table 5 match roughly 83% of the misclassifications made by the slss ann .",
    "the similar results obtained by these two very different classifiers does , perhaps , point to the existence of error in the original data . at the very least ,",
    "our results confirm the discovery made by the slss ann that the distinction between neighboring classes appears to be poorly defined .",
    "the two classification algorithms may ultimately be discovering a more accurate way by which to classify the original lauberts & valentijn data .",
    "the oc1 software discussed in this paper is available over the internet via anonymous ftp .",
    "the package contains full source code and extensive documentation . for instructions on how to retrieve the package , the authors request inquiries to be made to either salzberg@cs.jhu.edu or murthy@cs.jhu.edu .",
    "thanks to avi naim for providing the slss attribute choices for the lauberts & valentijn data , as well as some helpful comments . thanks to steven salzberg and sreerama k. murthy for providing the oc1 decision tree package , as well as suggestions towards its proper use . thanks to chris league for revision advice .",
