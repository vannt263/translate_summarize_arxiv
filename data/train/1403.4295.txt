    "first , the addition of especially deep wfc3/ir observations to legacy fields with deep acs observations allows for an improved determination of the @xmath16 lf at @xmath12 - 6 due to the @xmath61-mag greater depths of the @xmath16 lf probed at @xmath12 - 6 by the wfc3/ir near - ir observations relative to the original @xmath29-band observations .",
    "the gains at @xmath39 are even more significant , as the new wfc3/ir data make it possible ( 1 ) to perform a standard two - color selection of @xmath39 galaxies and ( 2 ) to measure their @xmath16 luminosities at the same rest - frame wavelengths as with other samples .",

    "redshift coverage of lyman - break - like selections is important , since it will allow us to leverage the full search volume , thereby reducing the sensitivity of the high - redshift results to large - scale structure variations and shot noise ( from small number statistics ) .",

    "while each of these surveys also provide constraints on the volume density of the bright rare sources , these programs generally lack high - spatial - resolution data on their candidates , making the rejection of low - mass stars from these survey fields more difficult .",
    "in addition , integration of the results from wide - area fields with deeper , narrower fields can be particularly challenging , as any systematic differences in the procedure for measuring magnitudes or estimating volume densities can result in significant errors on the measured shape of the lf ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig : oldi ] from appendix f.2 for an illustration of the impact that small systematics can have ) .",
    "controlling for cosmic variance is especially important given the substantial variations in the volume density of luminous sources observed field to field .",

    "our explicit exclusion of pointlike sources at bright magnitudes and known sne events ( e.g. , rodney et al .",

    "since this luminosity baseline is slightly longer than the separation between our slope measurements , we caution that the slope measurements we derive will not be entirely independent of each other .",
    "the longer luminosity baseline for each slope determination is quite useful , though , given the reductions in uncertainty on each slope measurement .",

    "we examine the @xmath130 - 6 case and the @xmath327 - 8 cases separately , given possible evolution in both the shape and functional form of the lf . in the two cases , we compute the inverse - variance - weighted mean effective slope and variance as a function of luminosity ( after removing the zero - point offset in effective slope ) .    the estimated 68% confidence intervals on the effective slope of the @xmath130 - 6 and @xmath327 - 8 lfs are indicated in the upper right and lower right panels of figure  [ fig : powlaw ] with the dark gray and light gray regions , respectively . in general , we find that our luminosity - dependent slope results are in broad agreement with the expectations of a schechter function . at the low - luminosity end , we see no evidence for the effective slope of the lf being especially steeper at @xmath323 mag than at @xmath325 mag .",
    "this argues against the effective slope of the @xmath16 lf being strongly luminosity dependent , as one might expect if there is curvature in the halo mass function or if galaxy formation were less efficient at lower masses ( e.g. , muoz & loeb 2011 ) .    at high luminosities , the @xmath130 - 6 @xmath16 lf show evidence for a similar exponential - like cut - off at bright magnitudes as that present in a schechter function ( compare the dark grey region in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : powlaw ] with the light grey region ) .",
    "not surprisingly , at @xmath327 - 8 , our overall constraints on the shape of the @xmath16 lf at high luminosities are much weaker and clearly not sufficient to constrain the functional form of the lf .",

    "determining the exact form of the evolution of the @xmath16 lf at high redshift has been rather challenging for at least two reasons .",
    "first of all , the schechter parameters become highly degenerate in cases of a steep faint - end slope @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath603 , due to the limited contrast between the faint - end slope of the lf and the effective slope of the lf at the bright end .",
    "this makes it more difficult to accurately measure the position of the knee of the lf ( making the schechter parameters highly degenerate ) .",
    "second , accurate measurements of the position of the knee of the lf are further complicated by ( 1 ) field - to - field variations , ( 2 ) the large volumes one needs to probe to accurately determine the bright end of the lf , and ( 3 ) systematic errors .",
    "systematic errors can affect determinations of the bright end of the lf differently than the faint end , due to the different data sets involved .",
    "such errors can also have a different impact on determinations of the lf at @xmath10 - 5 than at @xmath39 - 8 .    of all of the above factors ,",
    "perhaps the most challenging issue has been the substantial field - to - field variations in the surface densities of luminous sources . as table  [ tab : brightnumbers ] from appendix g illustrates , the surface density of bright @xmath39 - 8 galaxies appears to vary substantially depending upon where one happens to search .",
    "if one searches for bright @xmath39 - 8 galaxies in fields which are underdense ( as appears to have been the case over the candels - gs ) , one would have inferred a faster evolution at the bright end of the @xmath16 lf ( and hence @xmath24 ) than appears in fact to be present ( using all five candels fields ) .",
    "a comparison of the best - fit schechter parameters based on the candels - gn+gs ( table  [ tab : lfparm ] : _ upper rows _ ) with the parameters derived from all of our search fields ( table  [ tab : lfparm ] : _ lower rows _ ) suggests that this may have occurred .",
    "finally , if the @xmath16 lf at @xmath17 in fact has a non - schechter shape , this could also have contributed to the past confusion regarding the overall evolution of the @xmath16 lf . thus far",
    ", however , we find no evidence for such a non - schechter form (  4.4 ) .",
    "the recent discovery of four bright ( apparently robust ) @xmath41 galaxies over the candels - gn and gs by oesch et al .",
    "( 2014 ) leaves very little doubt as to how the @xmath16 lf at high redshift evolves .",

    "particularly central to many conclusions in this paper regarding the shape of the @xmath16 lf at @xmath39 - 8 concern the robustness of our constraints on the volume density of bright @xmath39 - 8 galaxies .",

    "2015 @xmath39 results ) .    to ensure that our results are well - determined ,",
    "it is useful for us to look at the robustness of the redshift estimates we have on the brightest @xmath39 - 8 sources and thus the contamination rate .",

    "moreover , using the photometric redshift code eazy to derive a redshift for the mean sed , we recovered @xmath607 , @xmath608 , and @xmath609 for the redshifts .",
    "as a second check on the robustness of the redshifts for bright sources in our @xmath39 - 8 samples , we used the photometric redshift code eazy ( brammer et al .",

    "the average source showed just a 1.0% probability of corresponding to a @xmath390 galaxy .",
    "for the individual sources themselves , we found that all 53 bright candidates preferred a @xmath17 solution over a @xmath390 solution .",
    "second , we investigated how the measured volume density of the brightest @xmath39 - 8 galaxy candidates varied from field to field . since all five candels fields have approximately the same selection volume for the brightest sources  given their similar areas and similar selectability of the brightest @xmath39 - 8 candidates ",
    "the number of bright candidates per candels field should provide us with an accurate estimate for the field - to - field variance in the volume density of bright @xmath39 - 8 galaxies .",
    "the total number of bright @xmath39 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath41 candidates in each of our search fields is given in table  [ tab : brightnumbers ] .",
    "interestingly enough , the number of bright candidates per field appears to show an approximate poissonian distribution relative to the mean , with the most extreme upward deviation from the mean being the number of bright @xmath21 galaxies in the candels - egs field .",
    "galaxies in at least one of the 5 candels fields 38% of the time  even assuming simple poissonian statistics and the mean number of bright galaxies found across all 5 candels fields . ]",

    "( 2013 ) appear to agree quite well with our measurements for the faintest , lowest - luminosity @xmath21 - 8 galaxies .",
