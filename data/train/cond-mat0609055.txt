    "the phase transition lines in fig.1 are defined as a maximum of @xmath21 because the @xmath22 curves show metamagnetic behavior . at higher temperatures ( 30k ) , it is true that the remanent magnetization is also enhanced upon increasing the pressure .",

    "argyriou et al . have reported that upon increasing pressure up to 0.6gpa , in the pmi state , both the mn - o(1 ) and mn - o(3 ) bond lengths shrink but the mn - o(2 ) bond length elongates @xcite . here ,",
    "the o(1 ) and o(2 ) oxygen atoms are located at the apical site along the @xmath1-axis , where o(1 ) lies between two mno@xmath4 layers and o(2 ) within a rocksalt - type la / sr - o layer .",

    "assuming such a variation of the mno@xmath48 octahedron in the pmi state of pr - substituted la@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 , the mn - o(1)-mn interactions along the @xmath1-axis and the mn - o(3)-mn interactions in the @xmath0-plane are expected to be strengthened upon application of pressure .",
    "in other words , the double exchange ( de ) interaction between mn@xmath49 and mn@xmath50 within the mno@xmath4 single layer and the de interaction along the @xmath1-axis within the bilayer are enhanced and this is closely related to the decrease of the critical fields of the fmm state with pressure . on the other hand , the reciprocal response of mn - o(2 ) to the applied pressures causes an elongation of the distance between adjacent bilayers , and it thus weakens the super - exchange interactions between adjacent bilayers , keeping the de interaction in the bilayer .",
    "this assumption describes well the negative pressure effect on the remanent @xmath43 at lower temperatures and is consistent with the positive effect on the remanent magnetostriction .",

    "the stretched exponential behavior of the relaxation curves indicates the existence of frustrations among competing interactions such as the fm and afm interactions in spin glass systems .",
    "we believe that the remanent magnetostriction shows a stretched exponential decay because of the competition between the double exchange and jt type lattice - orbital interactions@xcite .",
    "the former interaction causes a suppression of the local lattice distortion along the @xmath1-axis through the itinerant state , but the latter favors lattice deformation through the local jahn - teller effect@xcite .",
    "neutron scattering measurements on the parent bilayered manganite la@xmath16sr@xmath17mn@xmath4o@xmath5(@xmath18=0.38 ) have revealed the presence of an orbital frustration in the paramagnetic insulating state which prevents the system from the formation of a long - range orbital- and charge - ordered state @xcite .",

    "as a result , in fig.[relax ] , we summarize the relaxation time of both the remanent striction and remanent magnetization as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "the application of pressures up to @xmath44 0.8gpa to the system increases the relaxation time of the lattice by about two orders of magnitude , giving a more stable metallic state coupled with a suppression of mno bond lengths in the mno@xmath48 local lattice .",
    "the relaxation data of remanent magnetization under a pressure of 1gpa at 20k are presented in fig.[rema](c ) . in spite of the negative pressure effect on the remanent @xmath43 at lower @xmath47 , as mentioned before ( fig.[mc ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) , the relaxation time",
    "is strongly enhanced at 1gpa by more than two orders of magnitude and shows a positive pressure dependence .",
    "the difference in the relaxation time between remanent magnetization and magnetostriction can probably be explained by the fact that the magnetostriction observed here is not associated with a long - range order parameter such as the long - range orbital order reported in the @xmath18=0.5 crystal . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetization is closely related to it @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated the effect of pressure on magnetostriction , both in the @xmath0-plane and along the @xmath1-axis , in a bilayered manganite single crystal of ( la , pr)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 over the temperature region where the field - induced ferromagnetic metal ( fmm ) transition takes place . for comparison , we have examined the pressure dependence of the magnetization curves at the corresponding temperatures .",
    "the applied pressure reduces the critical field of the fmm transition and it also enhances the remanent magnetostriction .",
    "the quantitative differences observed in @xmath41 between @xmath40 and @xmath20 are higher critical fields and larger hysteresis regions in the former case , which is probably related to the easy axis of magnetization along the @xmath1-axis through the orbital occupation of @xmath10 electron between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states .",
    "an anomalous pressure effect on the remanent lattice relaxation is observed to be similar to the pressure effect on the remanent magnetization along the @xmath1-axis . in spite of the negative pressure effect on remanent @xmath43 at lower @xmath47 , the relaxation time",
    "is strongly enhanced at 1gpa by more than two orders of magnitude and shows a positive pressure dependence .",
    "these findings are understood considering that the double - exchange interaction - driven fmm state within a bilayer is strengthened upon application of pressure .",
    "application of pressure reinforces the de interaction , both in the @xmath0-plane and along the @xmath1-axis , through a shrinkage of mn - o(1 ) and mn - o(3 ) bond lengths , resulting in a giant effect on the relaxation time of remanent striction and remanent magnetization .",
