    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies of the local group ( for a review see mateo 1998 ) can provide crucial tests of the currently favored cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm of cosmological structure formation ( e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; blumenthal et al .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed so far for the origin of these systems , including gravitational interactions in the form of galaxy harassment ( e.g. , moore et al . 1996 ) tidal stirring ( mayer et al .",

    "( 2007 , 2009a ) have recently studied the evolution of two - component dwarf galaxies orbiting the milky way on a cosmologically motivated eccentric orbit using high resolution @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the dwarfs were initially composed of a stellar disk embedded in a more extended dark matter halo .",
    "three simulations were performed which differed by the initial inclination of the disk with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "although the evolution proceeded a little differently in each case , strong mass loss and morphological transformation of the disk always took place .",
    "after the first or second ( out of five ) pericenter passages the disk evolves into a bar which in the subsequent evolution becomes shorter .",
    "the morphological transformation of the stellar component is accompanied by the loss of angular momentum so that little rotation remains at the end .",
    "the final products are very similar in shape to the dsph galaxies of the local group . in this paper",
    "we study in detail the structural and kinematic properties of stars in these dwarfs at the end of their tidal evolution .

    "we adopted three approaches .",
    "first , assuming the shape of the mass profile given by the fitted scale lengths @xmath6 we adjusted the solutions of the jeans equation for the isotropic case ( with the anisotropy parameter @xmath7 ) i.e. fitting only the total mass @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding solutions are plotted as dotted lines in figure  [ dispprof ] .",
    "the sixth column of table  [ fittedsph ] gives the masses within @xmath9 divided by the actual mass of our simulated dwarfs within this radius .",
    "the last column lists the values of the goodness - of - fit measure @xmath10 rescaled to values corresponding to the total sample of a thousand stars and a hundred stars per bin .",
    "next , keeping the @xmath6 value fixed we adjust @xmath8 and @xmath11 as free parameters .",
    "the corresponding solutions are plotted in figure  [ dispprof ] as solid lines .",
    "a third option is to keep @xmath7 and adjust @xmath8 and the scale length @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting solutions are plotted in figure  [ dispprof ] as dashed lines .",

    "this is obviously due to neglecting the rotation and fitting only the dispersion profiles .",
    "this problem can only be self - consistently solved by considering axisymmetric models with intrinsic rotation , as we do in the next subsection .",
    "the best - fitting anisotropy is zero to mildly radial in rough agreement with the average value measured in 3d for this dwarf @xmath14 where the uncertainty is the dispersion of @xmath11 values in the left panel of figure  [ betakdiff ] . for dwarf",
    "b the mass is typically overestimated when the dwarf is observed along the longest axis and underestimated if seen along any other axis .",
    "note that only in this case the fitted anisotropy is mildly radial for all lines of sight and in good agreement with the 3d value of @xmath15 .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that for this case the condition @xmath16 required by the spherical models is best fulfilled ( see figure  [ dispcomp ] and the right panel of figure  [ betakdiff ] ) . for dwarf",
    "c the mass is strongly overestimated when the dwarf is observed along the longest axis and underestimated along the shortest axis . the inferred anisotropy varies from mildly tangential",
    "to mildly radial , while the 3d value is @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the estimates are least reliable as expected from the highly perturbed state of this dwarf .",
    "note that the best - fitting values of @xmath6 differ significantly from the ones obtained by fitting the surface density profiles of the stars ( table  [ fitted ] ) .",
    "this approach would therefore only be justified if the density profiles were unknown or highly uncertain . however , the trends in mass estimates are similar to the case when @xmath6 are fixed and anisotropy is fitted instead . with just three cases analyzed , out of which only one ( dwarf b ) is really reliable ( dwarf a has significant rotation and dwarf c is close to disruption ) we can not draw any firm conclusions concerning the reliability of our estimates of @xmath11 . however , the trend of mass estimates increasing with line of sight closer to the major axis is clear in all cases .",
    "so far we have modeled only the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles assuming that the galaxy is spherical .",
    "we will now try to reproduce both the rotation velocity profile and the velocity dispersion for our dwarf a and those lines of sight where the rotation was detected ( observation along the @xmath3 and @xmath4 axis ) .",
    "both moments are shown as a function of the distance along the major axis of the galaxy image in figure  [ veldisp ] . for the fitting the mean velocities",
    "were assigned standard errors of the mean @xmath18 .",
    "for the purpose of this study we will assume that the galaxy can be approximated as an axisymmetric system and again that the mass distribution follows that of stars .",
    "given that the flattening in our simulated dwarfs is much more pronounced in the stellar component ( see figure  [ density ] and fig .",
    "13 in klimentowski et al .",
    "2009a ) than in the dark halo ( which remains almost spherical : the densities measured along the major and the minor axis never differ by more than a factor of two ) it does not seem to be a realistic assumption .",
    "however , such one - component models may still be able to reproduce data better than spherical models .",
    "= 8.5 cm    for the axisymmetric systems it is convenient to work in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath19 ) where @xmath20 is now the radial coordinate measured from the center of the galaxy in the equatorial plane .",
    "we will assume that the only streaming motion in the galaxy is the rotation so @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "if we further assume that the system is described by a distribution function that depends only on the energy and the @xmath5-component of the angular momentum vector , @xmath23 then the second velocity moments obey @xmath24 , the mixed moments vanish and the jeans equations take the form ( binney & tremaine 2008 ) @xmath25    the rotation may be introduced in an arbitrary way , for example we may have ( satoh 1980 ; binney et al .",
    "1990 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the anisotropy parameter and @xmath28 corresponds to the velocity distribution which is isotropic everywhere in the system , namely @xmath29 . with this assumption and the known potential and density , equation ( [ jeans2 ] )",
    "can be solved for @xmath30 and introduced into equation ( [ jeans1 ] ) to obtain the rotation @xmath31 . for comparison with observations",
    "all quantities have to be projected along the line of sight ( see satoh 1980 ) .",
    "the upper right panel of figure  [ dispcomp ] shows that our simulated dwarf is not strongly anisotropic . in this figure",
    "we plot the profiles of the three velocity dispersions measured in cylindrical shells along @xmath20 containing equal numbers of stellar particles .",
    "we can see that they are very similar .",
    "the only significant difference is visible at @xmath32 kpc where @xmath33 is somewhat larger than the other two profiles .",
    "this is due to the radial motion of the stars in the inner remnant bar .",
    "the relative difference between the dispersions of velocities along @xmath20 and @xmath5 is further illustrated in the right panel of figure  [ betakdiff ] as the thick solid line .",
    "its positive value means that the underlying condition of our axisymmetric models , @xmath24 is not strictly obeyed .",
    "the profile of the anisotropy parameter @xmath27 ( reduced by unity ) , calculated by replacing @xmath34 with @xmath35 in equation ( [ aniso ] ) , is plotted as the thick solid line in the left panel of figure  [ betakdiff ] .",
    "the density distribution in these axisymmetric systems will be described by the modified plummer model ( [ modplum ] ) with @xmath36 @xmath37^{1/4}}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , so the model will be fully determined by its total mass @xmath8 and two scale lengths , @xmath6 and @xmath39 .",
    "the ratio of the scale lengths @xmath40 controls the amount of flattening and rotation in the system . we will again start with isotropic ( @xmath28 ) models where the only free parameter is the mass , while the scale - lengths are determined from the surface density distribution of the stars . to get them we measure the surface density but this time separately along the major and minor axis of the galaxy image .",
    "the results for the two lines of sight are illustrated in figure  [ surdenaxi ] .",
    "these profiles were fitted with the projections of the density following from ( [ modplumaxi ] ) and the resulting scale - lengths @xmath6 and @xmath39 are listed in the two lower rows of table  [ fitted ] .",
    "the quality of the fit is much better for the observation along @xmath3 ( left panel of figure  [ surdenaxi ] ) than for the observation along @xmath4 .",
    "this is not surprising since in the latter case the bar is more pronounced .",

    "are given in boldface and the @xmath10 values are rescaled to correspond to realistic samples .",
    "the table lists values obtained for different assumed inclinations of the galaxy where @xmath41 is the angle between the rotation plane and the line of sight .",
    "the best - fitting profiles of the velocity moments for @xmath43 are plotted in figure  [ veldisp ] .",
    "again , we tried three approaches , starting with fitting the mass only with @xmath6 and @xmath39 adopted from the fit to the surface density profile and @xmath28 .",
    "the best - fitting solutions are plotted in figure  [ veldisp ] as dotted lines .",
    "the fits are quite good in the case of the observation along the @xmath3 axis but rather poor in the case of observation along the @xmath4 axis , especially for the rotation curve .",
    "the rotation is much too large compared to the data in spite of fitting the mass .",
    "this overshooting of rotation is due to a very large @xmath40 ratio coming from the fit of the surface density distribution of the stars . in other words , self - consistent axisymmetric and",
    "isotropic models would predict more rotation for these @xmath40 ratios . still , the masses within @xmath44 found in this case are reasonable ( see table  [ fittedaxi ] ) , i.e. they are underestimated by no more than 20 per cent .    as for spherical models",
    "we next relax the assumption of isotropy and fit the data again with two free parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath27 . as discussed in detail by binney et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , decreasing @xmath27 can suppress the rotation curve of the models while increasing the dispersion profile .",
    "the results of the fitting are plotted in figure  [ veldisp ] as solid lines . as expected ,",
    "the quality of the fits is now improved , especially for the observation along the @xmath4 axis ( right hand panels of figure  [ veldisp ] ) where the rotation curve is now in better agreement with the data .",
    "note however , that the velocity dispersion profile is now worse reproduced and also the masses within @xmath44 are even more underestimated in comparison with the true values . a better approach in this case may therefore be to keep @xmath28 and adjust @xmath6 and @xmath39 instead together with the mass .",
    "the corresponding profiles of the velocity moments are plotted in figure  [ veldisp ] as dashed lines .",
    "the fits are now considerably improved and the masses are not underestimated by more than 15 per cent .",
    "note also that the fitted values of @xmath6 and @xmath39 are not very different from those estimated from fitting the surface density distribution of the stars .",
    "figure  [ models ] shows the surface density contours and the line - of - sight kinematics of these best - fitting axisymmetric models in a way analogous to figures  [ surden90 ] and [ velocity ] .",
    "we can see that the models qualitatively reproduce the shapes and kinematics of the simulated dwarf a. in particular , they reproduce the faster variation of the velocity moments with projected distance when the dwarf is seen along the longest axis , compared to the perpendicular direction . obviously , they are unable to reproduce the velocity gradient seen along the projected minor axis in the middle panel of the upper row in figure  [ velocity ] since this would only be possible with triaxial models ( binney 1985 ) .",
    "using high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations we have studied the stellar properties of dsph galaxies resulting from the tidally induced morphological transformation of disky dwarfs on a cosmologically motivated eccentric orbit around the milky way .",
    "we find that although the simulations differed only by the initial inclinations of the disk with respect to the orbital plane ( 0@xmath45 , 45@xmath45 , and 90@xmath45 ) , this single parameter change led to significantly dissimilar outcomes .",
    "the reason for this is the well - known effect that the tidal force is more effective in removing stars which are on more prolate orbits with respect to the orbital motion ( e.g. , read et al .",
    "the dwarf spheroidal galaxies obtained had different masses , density distributions , and velocity structure .",
    "although we have used a most probable orbit of dwarf galaxies in the local group ( diemand et al .",
    "2007 ) , the variation of orbital parameters would further differentiate the outcome of the simulations . on",
    "more circular orbits the dwarfs would be less affected by impulsive heating at pericenters and therefore we expect them to be less evolved , preserving a more prolate shape and more rotation as in earlier stages of the evolution on our eccentric orbit ( see klimentowski et al .",
    "2009a ) .",
    "the least evolved dwarf a ( with initial inclination of @xmath46 ) has an intrinsically triaxial distribution in the stellar component and preserved a fair amount of rotation .",
    "the rotation is mostly around the shortest axis .",
    "the intermediate case , dwarf b ( with initial inclination of @xmath47 ) , is a prolate spheroid and retained little rotation .",
    "the shape of its stellar component is still rather regular and so the dwarf can be considered a relaxed object .",
    "the most strongly evolved dwarf c ( with initial inclination of @xmath48 ) is also a prolate spheroid with very little rotation but its noisy density contours and profiles of velocity moments indicative of small numbers of bound stars suggest that it is very close to disruption .    despite the aforementioned differences and the fact that the final masses of the simulated dwarfs differ significantly ( see table  [ simprop ] and figure  [ mml ] ) , the final @xmath1 ratios are quite similar and fairly constant with radius .",
    "the former is related to the fact that the initial mass - to - light distributions of the dwarfs were identical and indicates that the dark matter and stars are lost in proportional amounts in all cases .",
    "the latter is a consequence of both our choice of initial conditions for the dwarf galaxy models and the fact that most of the dark matter outside of the stellar component is stripped efficiently .",
    "indeed , in the present study we adopt the mo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) scalings which connect the angular momentum / size of the disk with those of the parent dark matter halo .",
    "these general scalings together with our specific choice of parameters result in an initial dwarf galaxy with a @xmath1 ratio which is constant within @xmath49 kpc or so and increases thereafter ( klimentowski et al .",
    "2007 ) . as the outer dark matter halo",
    "gets tidally stripped , the effect of increasing @xmath1 ratio at larger distances , characteristic of the initial conditions , disappears .",
    "however , it is not difficult to imagine scenarios where this situation can change as , for example , in cases where the original disky dwarfs are constructed with much smaller scale lengths compared to the scale radius of the parent halo , @xmath50 .",
    "such modeling would probably result in a non - constant @xmath1 ratio within the luminous radius of the dwarf as the outer dark matter halo is tidally truncated .",
    "until cosmological simulations reveal the structure of the dwarf progenitors themselves , the choice of initial structural parameters will remain somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we studied the density distribution of the stellar component both radially averaged and along the principal axes . in the former case",
    "it is well fitted by the plummer law , in agreement with real dsph galaxies . for the latter we proposed a simple formula for the potential of the stellar component of the simulated dwarfs based on the generalization of the plummer law .",
    "this formula reproduces quite well the triaxial shape of model a and prolate spheroidal shapes of models b and c ( with a smaller number of parameters in the latter cases ) both when measured along the principal axes and in projection .",
    "the surface density distributions are quite similar to the observed ones , although a detailed comparison is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we also investigated the velocity distribution of the stars in the dwarfs along the principal axes and along the line of sight .",
    "the velocity structure seems to be the richest in the case of model a due to its triaxiality . in this case",
    "we detect rotation both around the short and the long axis which manifests itself in the misalignment of the zero velocity curve with respect to the projected minor axis .",
    "the velocity structure is much simpler in dwarfs b and c since almost no net streaming motion is seen there . in all models",
    "the dispersion of velocity is largest for velocities along the major axis which is due to the origin of the shapes of the dwarfs .",
    "all of them went through a prolonged bar - like phase where radial orbits along the bar are dominant and were transformed into prolate spheroids by systematic shortening of the bar .",
    "the projected velocity dispersions of our simulated galaxies decline slowly with radius , although some exhibit larger gradients .",
    "this behavior agrees with the observed profiles in real dsph galaxies ( e.g. okas et al . 2008 ; okas 2009 ) when the samples are cleaned of contamination using algorithms such as the one described in klimentowski et al .",
    "note that the majority of velocity dispersion profiles published in the literature ( e.g. muoz et al . 2005 ; koch et al .",
    "2007b ; walker et al .",
    "2007 ) are rather flat , which in our opinion is probably due to contamination from the milky way or tidally stripped stars but may also be caused by multiple stellar populations ( battaglia et al .",
    "2006 ) or an extended dark matter component ( e.g. walker et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "this velocity structure has important consequences for mass modeling .",
    "we fitted the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles of the dwarfs observed along the principal axes using different sets of free parameters . when the observation is done along the longest axis",
    "( the velocity dispersion is then larger and declines more steeply with radius ) the mass is typically mildly overestimated .",
    "when it is done along the intermediate or short axis , it is underestimated .",
    "the effect is largest for dwarf c , which is close to disruption , but even in this case the mass is over / underestimated by only about 60 percent .",
    "this suggests that the very high mass - to - light ratios estimated for some dsph galaxies , such as draco or ursa major , can not be explained by departures from sphericity , but are rather the result of the formation process of their progenitors , or are caused by other mechanisms that affected their baryonic mass fraction such as photoevaporation of the gas after reionization ( e.g. babul & rees 1992 ; bullock et al .",
    "2000 ) or the combined effect of heating by the uv background and subsequent ram pressure stripping in the hot gaseous corona of the milky way ( mayer et al . 2006 ; 2007 ) .    for dwarf b , which seems to provide the best model for the real dsph galaxies ( it still has a regular structure and shows little rotation ) we find that spherical modelling may overestimate the mass by up to 7 percent ( when the line of sight is along the major axis ) but underestimate it by up to 27 percent ( when viewed along a short axis ) .",
    "large kinematic samples of a few hundred up to a few thousand stars with measured velocities recently obtained by walker et al .",
    "( 2009b ) for carina , fornax , sculptor and sextans allow for mass determinations with statistical errors as small as 5 - 15 percent ( okas 2009 ) using simple models ( assuming constant mass - to - light ratios and anisotropy ) described here or similar .",
    "this means that the systematic errors due to non - sphericity of dsph galaxies are comparable or larger than the statistical errors in mass determination due to sampling errors of velocity moments for the best - studied dwarfs .    for dwarf a the velocity moments ( the rotation curve and the velocity dispersion profile ) are much better reproduced with axisymmetric models constructed under the assumption that only the rotation around the shortest axis in present ( i.e. neglecting the rotation around the longest axis ) .",
    "although the presence of rotation has been reported in a number of dsph galaxies , like ursa minor ( hargreaves et al .",
    "1994 ; armandroff et al . 1995 ) , leo i ( sohn et al . 2007 ) , sculptor ( battaglia et al .",
    "2008 ) , carina ( muoz et al . 2006 ) and recently for more distant ones , cetus ( lewis et al . 2007 ) and tucana ( fraternali et al .",
    "2009 ) , it remains to be seen if such models are applicable to real dsph galaxies as they would require measurements of rotation curves at higher significance level than presently available .",
    "we have demonstrated that the kinematics of our simulated dwarfs depends sensitively on the line of sight .",
    "this has intriguing implications for the missing satellites problem ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is formulated by mapping the observed stellar velocity dispersions of dwarf galaxies to subhalo maximum circular velocities , @xmath51 ( see also klimentowski et al .",
    "these results imply that because our remnant dwarfs are non - spherical , @xmath51 depends both on the specific model used to fit the potential of the dwarf and the line of sight used to measure stellar velocity dispersions , @xmath52 . in our models ,",
    "the measurement of the central velocity dispersion alone , when done along the longest axis can be higher by 50 percent compared to the perpendicular direction .",
    "we note that these findings are only relevant to dsphs that have a moderate mass - to - light ratio like our simulated dwarfs ( e.g. fornax or leo i ) .",
    "dwarfs embedded in a much more massive dark matter halo may in principle have a different relation between @xmath52 and @xmath51 since the stars could probe a region well inside the radius at which @xmath51 occurs .",
    "lastly , the findings of the present study demonstrate that for a given orbit and initial density distribution the stellar structure and kinematics of tidally stripped disky dwarfs depend sensitively on the initial inclination of the disk with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by mastropietro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) using @xmath0-body simulations to follow the tidal evolution and harassment of disk galaxies inside a galaxy cluster environment .",
    "the models presented in this paper as well as those of mastropietro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) do not include gas .",
    "mayer et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) have shown that gas present in the disky progenitors of dsphs can be either completely stripped ( by ram pressure and tides ) or partially retained producing periodic bursts of star formation at pericentric passages .",
    "the outcome depends sensitively on when the dwarf fell into the primary potential .",
    "the discriminating factors are the strength of the cosmic ultraviolet background and the local flux from the primary at the time of infall . in cases when gas is partially retained , it can affect the structural properties of the remnants , favoring a longer lived stellar bar and reducing tidal mass loss by increasing its central density following a bar - driven gas inflow . this would tend to produce a remnant more similar to that of model a of this paper , i.e. triaxial and with more residual rotation . however , as the gas is consumed and the dwarf becomes devoid of it , further tidal heating may change the internal structure of the dwarf again .",
    "fornax , carina and leo i , that had prolonged star formation , may have gone through these different phases .",
    "overall , the inclusion of gas is likely to induce further scatter in the final structural properties of dwarf galaxies orbiting the milky way .",
    "we will extend our analysis to gasdynamical models in future work .",
    "the numerical simulations were performed on the zbox2 supercomputer at the university of zrich .",
    "sk is funded by the center for cosmology and astro - particle physics at the ohio state university .",
    "this research was partially supported by the polish ministry of science and higher education under grant nn203025333 .",
