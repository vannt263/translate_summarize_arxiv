    "in the last few years there has been a resurgence of interest in the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "this was largely initiated by the measurements of the polarized structure function @xmath1 by the slac - yale @xcite and emc @xcite collaborations . in the ` naive ' parton model ,",
    "@xmath2 can , like the unpolarized structure function @xmath3 , be expressed in terms of the probability distributions for finding quarks with spin parallel or antiparallel to the longitudinally polarized parent proton : @xmath4   \\\\ g_1(x , q^2 ) & = & \\half \\sum_q\\ ; e_q^2\\ ;   [ \\delta q(x ) + \\delta\\bar q(x ) ] \\ ; , \\label{naiveg1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 the renewed interest in the subject was triggered by the first precision measurement of the integral of @xmath1 by the emc collaboration @xcite , @xmath6 which was significantly lower than the ` ellis - jaffe sum rule ' value of 0.18 @xcite .",

    ", we describe the input data which we use , and the corresponding first moments which obtain .",
    "the structure function @xmath1 occurs in the antisymmetric part of the hadronic tensor in deep inelastic scattering , which can be expressed as the matrix element of the axial vector current between two proton states  @xcite .",

    "the form of @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ qcdg1 ] ) has been a matter of some dispute during the past few years @xcite .",
    "kodaira @xcite first pointed out that the anomalous dimension of the singlet axial vector current was non - zero . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the first moment of @xmath79 is @xmath80 based on these ideas , altarelli and ross  @xcite evaluated the anomalous gluonic contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "a crucial point in this calculation is the regularization of collinear singularities ( from @xmath81 ) in the photon - gluon fusion process .",
    "depending on the regularization procedure used , one obtains different expressions for @xmath79 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the physical quark mass was used as a regulator , giving @xmath82 the scheme dependence of @xmath79 was further discussed by bodwin and qiu  @xcite .",
    "they obtained the surprising result that , in dimensional regularization and for finite quark masses , the first moment of @xmath79 vanishes .",
    "only the ( unphysical ) approach of assuming a small but finite gluon mass reproduced the result of @xcite",
    ". a careful reanalysis  @xcite of the polarized photon - gluon fusion process showed that in fact this disagreement between different regularization schemes comes from the soft non - perturbative region .",
    "contributions from this region should be absorbed into the light quark density , and should therefore not contribute explicitly to @xmath79 .",
    "this leaves us with two different possible @xmath79 , both with first moment equal to @xmath83 .",
    "the first is obtained by introducing a non - zero gluon mass , while the second derives from either introducing finite quark masses or from applying dimensional regularization , always subtracting the soft contribution : @xmath84       the gluon contribution to @xmath2 , eq .",
    "( [ qcdg1 ] ) , involves the convolution of @xmath79 with @xmath85 . rather than tying ourselves to a particular theoretical scheme ,",
    "we adopt the as procedure @xcite and define a  @xmath2-scheme \" gluon with @xmath86 .",
    "since only the first moments of the polarized quark and gluon densities are precisely defined , we are free to fix the higher moments in this way to obtain the simplest form for the gluon term in eq .",
    "( [ qcdg1 ] ) . of course , in a consistent next - to - leading order analysis , any change in the definition of @xmath87 is compensated by a corresponding change in the @xmath88 correction to the quark contribution , eq .",
    "( [ qcdg1 ] ) , in such a way that the physical quantity @xmath2 is scheme independent .",
    "a different choice of @xmath87 will then yield a different gluon _ and _ a different set of quark distributions .",
    "we are aware of the fact that our mixture of leading - order quark and next - to - leading order gluon contributions in @xmath2 is ambiguous .",
    "nevertheless we consider the incorporation of the anomalous gluon , although formally of order @xmath89 , to be motivated by the scaling behaviour of @xmath90 and by the magnitude of this contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "when complete next - to - leading order corrections become available it will of course be necessary to perform calculations of different processes within a consistent scheme .    within our leading - order approach ,",
    "it is straightforward to relate gluon distributions defined according to different schemes .",

    "as a result of over twenty years of experiments , the _ unpolarized _ parton distributions in the proton are very precisely known , see for example ref .",
    "some twenty independent parameters are needed to specify the various quark and gluon distributions at @xmath93 . in comparison ,",
    "measurements of the polarized distributions are still rather imprecise .",
    "it is therefore necessary to build in to the parametrizations a significant amount of theoretical prejudice .",
    "as measurements improve in the future , these expectations will be tested and refinements can be made .    at present , the only constraints on the distributions are ( i ) the specification of the first moments of the distributions , as described in the introduction and summarized in table  [ tab : sums ] , and ( ii ) the requirements of _ positivity _ of the individual spin - parallel and spin - antiparallel distributions : @xmath106 therefore , the absolute value of a polarized parton disrtibution always has to be smaller than the corresponding unpolarized distribution .",
    "we therefore require a consistent set of leading - order unpolarized distributions to provide the bounds  those of ref .",

    "we choose the same @xmath113 and @xmath114 values as @xcite , and similar starting parametrizations .",
    "only our choice of performing the whole evolution with three quark flavours differs from @xcite .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we start at @xmath114 with valence - like forms for the up and down quarks and with an unpolarized sea : @xmath115 with normalization factors @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) to ensure that @xmath118 : @xmath119 non - zero polarized su(3 ) symmetric sea quark distributions are generated dynamically for @xmath120 ( see below ) .",
    "note that ( i ) the positivity constraints ( [ eq : pos ] ) demand that the @xmath121 parameter values are at least as big as the corresponding unpolarized parameters of eq .",
    "( [ eq : unpol ] ) , and ( ii ) the convergence of the first moment integrals requires @xmath122 .    even with these constraints , there are still too many free parameters in ( [ eq : form ] ) for the amount of data available .",
    "we therefore impose additional theoretical constraints at large and small @xmath0 , based on dimensional counting and coherence / regge arguments respectively @xcite .",
    "a good discussion of these can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present context , they can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the assumption that the small @xmath0 behaviour of the quark distributions is controlled by regge behaviour requires @xmath123 .",
    "coherence arguments at small @xmath0 give @xmath124 for the gluon distribution .",
    "spectator quark counting rules for the @xmath125 behaviour suggest @xmath126 and require @xmath127 and @xmath128 to be the same as in the unpolarized case .",
    "we have already mentioned that the most accurate data at present are for @xmath1 .",
    "this means that the detailed shape of the @xmath25-quark and gluon distribution can not yet be determined .",
    "thus for the former we impose @xmath129 , and for the latter we suggest three qualitatively different forms , defined by @xmath130 the reasoning behind these choices is as follows : @xmath131 ( the ` standard ' form ) will give a fit with @xmath132 at large @xmath0 , which corresponds to a fast - moving gluon being equally likely to have its spin parallel or antiparallel to the parent proton ; @xmath133 large and positive will lead to @xmath134 at large @xmath0 , i.e. a fast - moving gluon which is preferentially polarized in the direction of the proton s spin ; @xmath133 large and negative will give a large-@xmath0 gluon whose spin is anticorrelated with that of the proton .",
