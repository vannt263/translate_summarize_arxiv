    "the study of nuclear structure has advanced on the basis of the shell structure associated with the magic numbers .",
    "this study , however , has been carried out predominantly for stable nuclei , which are on or near the @xmath3-stability line in the nuclear chart and have been explored experimentally .",
    "advances in measurements of unstable nuclei have provided information on exotic nuclei toward the neutron and proton drip lines .",
    "close to them , a large variety of formerly unknown nuclear configurations has been observed .",
    "the magic numbers in such exotic systems can be a quite intriguing issue .",
    "new magic numbers appear and some others disappear in moving from stable to exotic nuclei in a rather novel manner due to specific components of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "low - lying states of neutron - rich nuclei around the neutron number @xmath4=20 attract a great interest , as the spherical configurations associated with the magic number disappear in the ground states . for @xmath1 mg , from the observed population of the excited @xmath5 state ( found at 1.058 mev ) in the @xmath6 reaction on @xmath7 mg ,",
    "it is suggested @xcite that the @xmath5 state is a spherical one coexisting with the deformed ground state and that their relative energies are inverted at @xmath4=20 .",
    "very recently , a new signature of an existence of `` island of inversion '' @xcite has been experimentally tested by measuring the charge radii of all magnesium isotopes in the @xmath2 shell at isolde - cern @xcite showing that the borderline of this island lies between @xmath7 mg and @xmath8 mg .",
    "the new mass measurements of the exotic nuclides @xmath9 mg have led to a value of 1.10(3 ) mev for the empirical shell gap for @xmath1 mg , which reveals the lowest observed strength of nuclear shell closure for a nuclide with a conventional magic number @xcite .",
    "previously , the coulomb excitation studies of @xmath1 mg also confirmed the large deformation and pointed out the vanishing of the @xmath4=20 shell gap @xcite .",
    "the concept of `` island of inversion '' has been explored , for instance , experimentally also to isotones with @xmath4=19 @xcite and complementary information about its extent to at least @xmath4=22 for the ne isotopes was obtained @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the properties of neutron - rich mg isotopes have been mainly studied in the framework of the shell model @xcite , as well as within self - consistent mean - field approaches , namely , the skyrme hartree - fock ( hf ) method with pairing correlations ( see , for example , refs .",

    "it was shown that the level inversion of @xmath13 and @xmath14 states that may occur for the magnesium isotopes with more neutrons away from the stability line can lead to a large measurable central charge depletion to the charge density distributions for the neutron - rich mg isotopes .",
    "recently , the constrained hfb plus local quasiparticle rpa method has been used to describe a variety of quadrupole collective phenomena in a unified way , particularly the shape fluctuations in the ground and excited 0@xmath16 states of @xmath7 mg and @xmath1 mg nuclei @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole deformation properties of the ground and low - lying excited states of the even - even magnesium isotopes with @xmath4 ranging from 8 to 28 were successfully described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an angular momentum projected generator coordinate method with the gogny force was explored .",
    "the fully - microscopic antisymmetrized molecular dynamics calculations with the same gogny - d1s effective interaction have well reproduced measured ground - state properties ( spin - parity , total binding energy , one - neutron separation energy , and matter radii ) of mg isotopes @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath4=20 and @xmath4=28 `` islands of inversion '' have been shown to merge in the magnesium chain , enclosing all the isotopes between @xmath4=19 and @xmath4=30 , by performing large - scale shell - model calculations for their description .",
    "the nuclear deformation plays an important role to determine the charge and matter radius of the neutron - rich nuclei , in particular for the description of the structure of the mg isotopes @xcite . a direct link between the inversion of states in the deformed shell model and the change in the quadrupole deformation takes place @xcite .",
    "nuclear radii carry also important information about shell effects and residual interactions .",
    "the recent development of the radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities has made it possible to search for anomalous structure effects , such as the halo and skin , that are related with the isotope and isospin dependencies of the radii .",
    "@xcite reported experimental effective rms matter radii of some na and mg nuclei .",
    "they concluded that the increase of the rms matter radius is mainly due to an increase of the rms neutron radius .",

    "the obtained results are illustrative for the range of the skin sizes to be expected depending on the adopted skin definition .",
    "the knowledge of skin thickness gives more insight into the properties of neutron - rich nuclei and allows to resolve some of the basic features of the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter ( anm ) .",
    "the neutron skin thickness is strongly correlated with the density dependence of the neutron - matter eos @xcite and of the symmetry energy of nuclear matter ( see , e.g. , the articles in the topical issue @xcite ) .",
    "the precise knowledge of these relations is essential for predicting the structure of neutron stars , particularly their radii @xcite .    in our recent works",

    "the new data for the charge rms radii @xcite is a challenging issue to test the applicability of the mean - field description to light nuclei , thus expecting to understand in more details the nuclear structure revealed by them .",
    "the need of information for the symmetry energy in finite nuclei , even theoretically obtained , is a major issue because it allows one to constrain the bulk and surface properties of the nuclear edfs quite effectively .",
    "therefore , following our recent works @xcite we analyze the correlation between the skin thickness and the characteristics related to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy for the same mg isotopic chain .",

    "@xcite , where a slight modification of the spin - orbit strength of the effective interaction for a better description of the `` island of inversion '' was also applied . similar effect of the pairing strength on the deformation of @xmath1 mg has been observed in @xcite , namely that stronger pairing force of neutrons and weaker pairing force of protons lead to a larger deformation of the ground state for @xmath1 mg .",

    "[ fig10],width=245 ]    the impact of these new modified calculations on the evolution of the charge radii , especially in the region of the mg isotopic chain where an `` island of inversion '' is expected , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "in addition to @xmath1 mg , we apply the same procedure also to @xmath8 mg nucleus in order to establish better the border of the island . a further increase of the charge radii of these isotopes is found . for @xmath8",
    "mg the charge rms radius increases from 3.117 fm to 3.154 fm and for @xmath1 mg from 3.137 fm to 3.179 fm toward the experimentally extracted values for both nuclei indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] . in general",
    ", it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] that the comparison between the new values that are very close to the experimental data @xcite and the previously obtained values of the charge radii of @xmath138 mg isotopes can define a region associated with the `` island of inversion '' which is not seen in the hf+bcs theoretical method by using the original skyrme force fitted to stable nuclei .     of mg isotopes in the range @xmath0=2732 .",
    "the open red triangles represent the calculated values of @xmath139 when the spin - orbit strength of the effective interaction is increased by 20% .",
    "[ fig11],width=302 ]      in this subsection we present our results for the symmetry energy @xmath17 and the neutron pressure @xmath18 in mg isotopes from the considered isotopic chain applying the cdfm scheme ( see section  ii ) , as well as their relationship with the neutron skin thickness @xmath140 .",
    "the symmetry energy and the pressure are calculated within the cdfm according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) by using the weight functions ( [ eq:9 ] ) calculated from the self - consistent densities in eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) .",
    "the differences between the neutron and proton rms radii of these isotopes [ eq .",
    "( [ eq:28 ] ) ] are obtained from hf+bcs calculations using three different skyrme forces , sly4 , sgii , and sk3 .",
    "the results for the symmetry energy @xmath17 [ eq .  ( [ eq:10 ] ) ] as a function of the mass number @xmath0 for the whole mg isotopic chain ( @xmath0=2036 ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "it is seen that the sgii and sk3 forces yield values of @xmath17 comparable with each other that lie above the corresponding symmetry energy values when using sly4 set .",
    "although the values of @xmath17 slightly vary within the mg isotopic chain ( 2326 mev ) when using different skyrme forces , the curves presented in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] exhibit the same trend .",
    "it is useful to search for possible indications of an `` island of inversion '' around @xmath4=20 revealed also by the symmetry energy .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see how the trend of the symmetry energy will be changed when for the magic number @xmath4=20 a prolate deformed ground state of @xmath1 mg is obtained ( see fig .  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "we would like to note that , in this case , the modification of the spin - orbit strength of the sly4 effective interaction by increasing it by 20% leads to a smaller value of @xmath17=23.67 mev compared with the one for the spherical case @xmath17=24.75 mev .",
    "thus , the role of deformation on the nuclear charge radii is also confirmed on the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "indeed , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] are related to the evolution of the quadrupole parameter @xmath141 as a function of the mass number @xmath0 that is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , as well as to the evolution of the charge radii in fig .",
    "we find strong deformations in the range @xmath0=22 - 24 that produce larger charge radii in relation to their neighbors , and local wells in the symmetry energy .",
    "next , there is a region of flat energy profiles that correspond to small charge radii and increasing values of the symmetry energy . above this region",
    "we find first spherical shapes that produce a plateau in the symmetry energy from @xmath0=28 to @xmath0=34 and finally prolate deformations in @xmath0=36 that produce very large radii and a sharp decrease in the symmetry energy .",
    "this confirms the physical interpretation given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where this fact is shown to be a result from the moving of the extra neutrons to the surface thus increasing the surface tension but reducing the symmetry energy .",
    "although the considered mg chain does not contain a double - magic isotope , it is worth mentioning that we find maximum values within a plateau around the semi - magic isotope @xmath0=32 that resembles the sharp peak observed in previous works including double - magic nuclei @xcite .     for mg isotopes ( @xmath0=2036 )",
    "calculated with sly4 , sgii , and sk3 forces .",
    "[ fig12],width=283 ]    we show in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] the correlation of the neutron - skin thickness @xmath121 [ eq .  ( [ eq:28 ] ) ] of mg isotopes with the @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters extracted from the density dependence of the symmetry energy around the saturation density .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] that , in contrast to the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is no linear correlation observed for the mg isotopic chain .",
    "this behaviour is valid for the three skyrme parametrizations used in the calculations .",
    "such a non - linear correlation of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the neutron skin thickness @xmath121 can be explained with the fact that stability patterns are quite irregular within this mg isotopic chain , where anomalies in shell closures around @xmath4=20 leading to increased quadrupole collectivity exist .",
    "additionally , we find the same peculiarity at @xmath0=27 from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] exhibited in the case of the charge rms radii just reflecting the transition regions between different nuclear shapes of mg isotopes in the considered chain and a small change in the behaviour for nuclei heavier than @xmath1 mg , as well .     for mg isotopes as a function of the symmetry energy @xmath17 and the pressure @xmath18 calculated with sly4 , sgii , and sk3 forces .",
    "[ fig13],width=302 ]",
    "in this work , we study nuclear properties of mg isotopes by means of a theoretical approach to the nuclear many - body problem that combines the coherent density fluctuation model @xcite and the deformed hf+bcs method ( with skyrme - type density - dependent effective interactions @xcite ) .",
    "three skyrme parametrizations were involved in the calculations : sly4 , sgii , and sk3 .",
    "the cdfm makes the transition from the properties of nuclear matter to the properties of finite nuclei allowing to investigate the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath17 and the neutron pressure @xmath18 in finite nuclei on the base of the brueckner energy - density functional for infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the isotopes investigated in this work go from the proton - drip - line nucleus @xmath10 mg up to @xmath105 mg that approaches the neutron - drip - line .",
    "the deformation energy curves show several transitions of equilibrium shapes as more and more neutrons are added .",
    "the lowest isotope @xmath10 mg has an energy minimum at zero deformation parameter value , corresponding to the expected equilibrium spherical shape for a semi - magic ( @xmath4=8 ) nucleus .",
    "the next two isotopes , @xmath94 mg and @xmath97 mg , have well defined prolate equilibrium shapes with deformation parameter values around 0.4 , while the next one , @xmath95 mg , shows shape coexistence with oblate and prolate equilibrium shapes very close in energy ( the oblate minimum being somewhat deeper than the prolate one ) . as two or four neutrons are added the nucleus becomes soft , with a flat minimum in an extended region around @xmath3=0 , till we reach the next semi - magic nucleus @xmath1 mg , which again has spherical equilibrium shape .",
    "however , in this new semi - magic nucleus one can appreciate a tendency for the nucleus to become prolate , as indicated by the shoulder on the right hand side of the energy profile . finally , the nucleus changes again to soft or prolate when adding two ( @xmath103 mg ) or four ( @xmath105 mg ) more neutrons , respectively . as the proton number is below half - filled-@xmath2 shell ,",
    "the well defined equilibrium prolate shapes take place when the neutron numbers are either below half-@xmath2-shell , or below half-@xmath132-shell .",
    "the neutron density profiles are underneath the proton ones when @xmath142 , practically overlapping when @xmath4=@xmath100 , and exceed them when @xmath143 , as expected , showing a sudden strong increase in the central region at @xmath4=16 .",
    "the central bump that appears at this @xmath4 value is due to the occupancy of the @xmath109 shell and remains for larger @xmath4 values . on the other hand ,",
    "the proton density profiles tend to develop a central hole with increasing values of @xmath0 beyond @xmath0=28 in order to maintain the proton surface as close as possible to the neutron one .",
    "the charge and mass radii follow the trends observed in the experiment , with fluctuating values up to @xmath0=26 , and smoothly increasing values with @xmath0 , beyond @xmath0=27 .",
    "these global properties are found to be rather similar with the three skyrme forces .",
    "the observed tendency for @xmath1 mg to become deformed has been confirmed by repeating our calculations with sly4 force modifying slightly the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "an increase by a 20% of the spin - orbit strength is sufficient to transform the above mentioned shoulder of the energy profile into a minimum at @xmath3=0.38 , reflecting the role of the intruder @xmath132-shell , mainly @xmath135 intruder .",
    "the charge radii calculated at the deformed minima obtained with the increased spin - orbit interaction for @xmath0=31 , 32 are larger ( the increase is from 3.117 fm to 3.154 fm in @xmath8 mg and from 3.137 fm to 3.179 fm in @xmath1 mg ) , and are in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "similar effects are caused by slightly changing the proton and neutron pairing strengths .",
    "these findings are consistent with results of other theoretical calculations ( e.g. , within the generator coordinate method ) and support the interpretation of this nuclear region as an `` island of inversion ''",
    ".    the correlations of the the neutron skin thickness @xmath121 with the symmetry energy @xmath17 and with the neutron pressure @xmath18 do not exhibit linear behavior .",
    "they show up the same peculiarities at @xmath0=27 that reflect the transition regions between different nuclear shapes of mg isotopes in the considered chain discussed above .",
    "the values of the symmetry energy @xmath17 vary roughly between 23 and 26 mev , being larger for sk3 force , smaller for sly4 force and in between for the sgii effective interaction .",
    "even more dramatic is the considerable change in the trend of symmetry energy evolution with the mass number , when we include the results for the prolate ( @xmath3=0.38 ) ground - state of @xmath1 mg obtained with the spin - orbit modified sly4 effective interaction .",
    "the behavior of these correlations in this isotopic chain is quite different from that found in our former studies on very heavy isotopic chains , where we found smoother patterns and more regularities .",
    "this is clearly due to the fact that shell effects are much more pronounced in these lighter isotopic chains than they are in the heavy ones .",
    "to probe nuclear structure models it is necessary to have unambiguous experimental observables for the location of shell and subshell closures .",
    "therefore , the study of the nuclear level inversion and nuclear bubble phenomenon would be more complete after performing electron scattering off short - lived nuclei on the new generation electron - nucleus rib facilities . concluding , we would like to note that further study is necessary to prove theoretically the existence of an `` island of inversion '' probed by the rex - isolde experiment .",
    "in particular , it is worth to perform calculations by including effects of tensor and three - body forces and exploring novel energy density functionals .",
