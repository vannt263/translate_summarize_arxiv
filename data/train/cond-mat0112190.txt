    "a ferromagnetic material is characterized by a remanent magnetization even at zero field . in several instances ,",
    "however , it is convenient to _ demagnetize _ the sample , bringing it to a state of zero magnetization at zero field . in practice",
    ", this can done applying a slowly varying ac field , decreasing its amplitude after each cycle . in this way",
    ", the system explores a complex energy landscape , due to the interplay between structural disorder and interactions , until it is trapped into a low energy minimum .",
    "if the demagnetization process is performed adiabatically and thermal effects do not play an important role , the demagnetized state is reproducible for a given realization of the quenched disorder and can thus be used as a reference to define magnetic properties .",
    "the hysteresis loops at low fields , starting from the demagnetized state , are usually described by the rayleigh @xcite law : when the field is cycled between @xmath1 , the magnetization @xmath2 follows @xmath3 , where the signs @xmath4 distinguish the upper and lower branch of the loop .",
    "consequently the area of the loop scales with the peak field @xmath5 as @xmath6 and the response to a small field change , starting from the demagnetized state is given by @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this law has been measured in a variety of materials , but a few papers have reported significant deviations from the simple quadratic law but no explanation has been provided @xcite .    the current theoretical interpretation of this law is based on a 1942 paper by nel @xcite , who derived the law formulating the magnetization process as the dynamics of a point ( i.e. the position of a domain wall ) in a random potential . in this framework , the initial susceptibility @xmath8 is associated to reversible motions inside one of the many minima of the random potential , while the hysteretic coefficient @xmath9 is due to irreversible jumps between different valleys .",
    "the main drowback of nel theory relies in its purely phenomenological nature , being based on a _ zero dimensional _ model which does not include collective effects considered very important for the magnetization process @xcite .    in the past few years",
    ", the zero temperature random - field ising model ( rfim ) has been used to describe the competition between quenched disorder and exchange interactions and their effect on the hysteresis loop @xcite . in three and higher dimensions ,",
    "the model shows a phase transition between a continuous cycle for strong disorder and a discontinuous loop , with a macroscopic jump , at low disorder .",
    "the two phases are separated by a second order critical point , characterized by universal scaling laws @xcite .",
    "a behavior of this kind is not restricted to the rfim but has also been observed in other models , with random bonds @xcite , random anisotropies @xcite or vectorial spins @xcite . in addition , a similar disorder induced phase transition in the hysteresis loop has been experimentally reported for a co - co0 bilayers @xcite .",
    "the rfim is probably the simplest model including disorder and exchange interactions that can be treated analytically .",
    "the model has been solved exactly in one dimension @xcite and on the bethe lattice @xcite , while mean - field theory @xcite and renormalization group @xcite have been used to analyze the transition .",
    "recently the one dimensional solution of the model , has been generalized to obtain the complete demagnetization process and to derive the rayleigh loops @xcite .",
    "the rfim does not display a phase transition in one dimensions , while numerical simulations indicate that the transition has an important effect on the demagnatization process .",
    "in particular , in the low disorder phase the discontinuity in the saturation curve prevents the magnetization to reach a demagnetized state @xcite but this behavior has not been understood theoretically .",
    "it has been shown exactly that the rfim displays a disorder induced phase transition on the bethe lattice when the coordination number @xmath10 @xcite and can thus be used to clarify the issue .    here",
    "we generalize the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite to obtain exact recursion relations for the demagnetization process on the bethe lattice and show that demagnetization is only possible in the high disorder phase . in the low disorder phase the remanent magnetization after a series of nested loops of decreasing amplitude does not vanish but scales to zero as the transition is approached .",
    "furthermore , in the low disorder phase the rayleigh law is not obeyed and low field loops are not symmetric .",
    "the rayleigh law is instead recovered in the high disorder phase and the rayleigh parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 behave qualitatively as in @xmath11 , displaying a peak in the disorder .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the model . in section",
    "iii we recall the results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and generalize them for a series of nested loops .",
    "section iv discusses the effect of the phase transition on the magnetization and section v analyzes the rayleigh law .",
    "a brief discussion of the perspectives is reported in section vi .",
    "finally , the complete derivation of the recursion relations is reported in the appendix .",
    "in this section we recall briefly a model used to describe hysteresis loops in magnetic materials @xcite : the ferromagnetic random field ising model ( rfim ) .",
    "this model is characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 , the @xmath14 is restricted on the pairs of nearest neighbors on a lattice of coordination number @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the ising spin on the site @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a homogeneous external field , and @xmath19 represents a quenched random field on the spin @xmath16 modelling the presence of lattice defects . the fields @xmath20 are independently drawn from a symmetric distribution @xmath21 . in the following the numerical results",
    "are referred to a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath22 .    in this paper",
    "we study the case of a bethe lattice with a generic coordination number @xmath15 .",
    "in particular we are interested in the case @xmath23 which is known to be the minimal case showing a disorder induced phase transition towards a discontinuous hysteresis loop .    in order to mimic the microscopic spin dynamics",
    ", we use the flipping rules used in refs .",
    "@xcite obtained from the glauber dynamics at temperature @xmath24 and with an external field of frequency @xmath25 taking the limit @xmath26 first and then @xmath27 .",
    "the basic rule of this @xmath28 dynamics is that the spins align with the local field : @xmath29 where the effective local field felt by the spin @xmath17 is @xmath30 and the sum runs over the @xmath15 nearest neighbors of the site @xmath17 .",
    "note that though the model is defined through three external parameters @xmath31 , the dynamics is determined by the two reduced quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 only . for the sake of simplicity , from now on we rename these two ratios @xmath18 and @xmath34 respectively and consider @xmath35 .",
    "given @xmath18 and @xmath34 , we can write the probability @xmath36 that a spin @xmath17 , with @xmath2 ( @xmath37 ) of its neighbors _ up _ , is also _",
    "up_. this is given by the probability that @xmath38 : @xmath39",
    "in general a change in the applied field @xmath18 produces a rearrangement of the spins , so that each spin @xmath17 is stable being aligned with its effective field @xmath40 .",
    "it is important to note that each spin flip modifies the effective field on the nearest neighbors and sometimes generates an avalanche of spin flips through the lattice . in the following",
    "we will consider the case of a slowly varying external field : its value is kept constant until the next metastable state is reached .",
    "two important properties of the @xmath28 dynamics are ( i ) the abelian property  the stable state after an avalanche does not depend on the order in which the spins flip  , and ( ii ) the return point memory  when the field is changed adiabatically",
    "the stable state only depends on the point where the field was last reversed .",
    "these two properties can be used to obtain exactly the shape of the hysteresis loops .",

    "in particular we are interested in _ nested _ minor loops , since they are directly related to the demagnetization process of the disordered ferromagnet .",
    "nested loops is defined as follows : after having reached @xmath52 , we reverse again the field increasing its value up to @xmath58 ( lower half of the first minor loop )",

    "a similar procedure was used in @xmath11 to obtain a closed expression for the magnetization along the demagnetization curve .",
    "this is not possible for the bethe lattice where an explicit solution for the problem is not available and one should resort to a numerical integration .",
    "previous numerical studies of the zero temperature dynamics of the rfim on a regular lattice in finite dimension @xcite have shown that in @xmath89 the system shows a phase transition from a strong disorder phase to a weak disorder phase , separated by a second order critical point ( in @xmath90 the presence of a phase transition is still controversial ) . in the strong disorder phase the major hysteresis loop is continuos , whilst in the weak disorder phase the loop shows a macroscopic jump in the magnetization at a critical value of the field .",
    "note that if we use the reduced parameters @xmath33 and @xmath32 , fixing @xmath35 , strong disorder corresponds to small values of @xmath34 and the phase transition will be charcterized by a critical value @xmath91 of the exchange coupling @xmath34 . on the bethe lattice ,",
    "a phase transition is observed for coordination numbers @xmath92 , while for @xmath93 one has only the strong disorder phase @xcite .",
    "the presence of the phase transition has strong implications on the possibility of demagnetizing the system .",
    "in particular in the weak disorder phase phase it is not possible to demagnetize the system through an oscillating external field with decreasing amplitude .    before we specialize to the case @xmath23 ,",

    "@xcite .    above the transition ( @xmath102 or weak disorder phase ) the hysteresis loop becomes discontinuous @xcite .",
    "in fact at @xmath103 the and @xmath104 the susceptibility @xmath105 diverges , and for @xmath102 one observes a discontinuity whith a spinodal singularity . at this point",
    "one can measure a gap @xmath106 in the magnetization .",
    "it is easy to show , through an expansion of eq .",
    "( [ u02 ] ) to the lowest order in @xmath107 around @xmath91 , that for @xmath108 it is @xmath109 with @xmath110 as in the mean field case .",

    "( [ gap ] ) considering that to the lowest order @xmath117 . actually , the position of the gap in the mgnetization of the major loop of the hysteresis cicle is located at @xmath118 , which could give corrections to the previous result .",
    "however , one can show that @xmath119 , implying corrections to the previous value of the gap of the same order in @xmath120 . then this correction does not alter the found scaling behavior .",
    "we recall that usually it is possible to demagnetize a material by applying a slowly oscillating external field appropriately chosen . in practice",
    ", this corresponds to a series of nested loops , starting from the completely magnetized situation ( e.g. @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) and then applying in succession the fields @xmath123 , @xmath124 , ... ,",
    "@xmath125 in the limits @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "this sequence , for @xmath128 , leads to a completely demagnetized state .",
    "this is due to two fundamental properties of the strong disordered phase : ( i ) the `` return point memory '' property which has been defined in the previous paragraph ; ( ii ) the fact that , if we are on a certain point of the saturation loop ( e.g. at @xmath129 on the lower half ) and invert the field to @xmath52 the system meets the other half on the saturation loop if @xmath130 .",
    "this implies that in order that the first minor loop is symmetric with respect to the origin @xmath131 and @xmath132 without touching the saturation curve we have to start from @xmath123 on the lower half of the saturation loop ( or equivalently from @xmath133 on the upper half ) .    at @xmath102",
    "the demagnetization process is no more possible , because the discontinuity prevents minor loops to be symmetric with respect to the origin of the axes .",
    "in fact there is now an inaccessible region of the plane @xmath134 around the origin @xcite .",
    "however , the field succession described above still provides a well defined procedure ( apart the broken simmetry @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) to minimal possible residual magnetization , that we denote @xmath137 , at @xmath131 . following this procedure , by numerically integrating eqs .",
    "( [ u2n],[d2n+1 ] ) with @xmath138 , we find that @xmath137 displays the same scaling behavior of the gap in the saturation loop as @xmath34 approaches @xmath91 from above : @xmath139 ( see fig([log ] ) ) .",
    "notice that in numerical simulations in the @xmath140 rfim @xcite @xmath137 was found to coincide , in the low disorde phase , with the saturation magnetization @xmath141 .",
    "the rayleigh law describes the hysteresis behavior at low field in a vast class of materials .",
    "exact values for the rayleigh parameters have been obtained for the one dimensional rfim @xcite , where the initial susceptibilty @xmath8 and the hysteretic coefficient @xmath9 both display a peak in the disorder @xmath142 .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in simulation for @xmath143 but only in the high disorder phase , while in the low disorder phase @xmath8 and @xmath9 are not defined .    in the case of the bethe lattice",
    ", we could not obtain an explicit expression of the rayleigh parameters even in the high disorder phase .",
    "we thus resort to numerical integration and analyze the demagnetization curves close to @xmath131 .",
    "we estimate the susceptibility @xmath8 and the hysteretic coefficient @xmath9 using a linear fit of @xmath144 vs @xmath62 .",
    "according to the rayleigh law for @xmath145 we have @xmath146 , and similarly for negative fields @xmath147 .",
    "the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 as a function of the exchange coupling @xmath34 are shown in figs  [ a ] and [ bb ] . when plotted as a function of the disorder @xmath142 , @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "show a peak in the high disorder phase , in agreement which the results on euclidean lattices .    in the low disorder phase the demagnetization curve is not symmetric with respect to @xmath131 and",
    "consequently the rayleigh law does not hold .",
    "in particular , we can define two values for the coefficient @xmath9 : @xmath148 @xmath149 the values of @xmath8 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 as a function of the exchange coefficient @xmath34 are shown in fig ( [ a],[bb ] ) ; also the difference @xmath152 is shown in fig ( [ b - b ] ) , again , as @xmath153 , @xmath154 approaches @xmath155 as @xmath156 ( see fig([log ] ) ) .",
    "in conclusion , the present analysis allows to clarify the role of a disorder induced phase transition on the demagnetization properties of a ferromagnet .",
    "in particular , we find that in the low disorder phase the jump in the saturation curve gives rise to an inaccessible region in the ( @xmath2,@xmath18 ) plane close to @xmath131 and @xmath132 . even after an infinitesimally fine series of nested loop the final magnetization @xmath0 does not vanish . approaching the transition , however , @xmath0 scales to zero with an exponent @xmath157 , which is the same as the one controlling the size jump in the saturation curve .",
    "while this value could be an artifact of the bethe approximation , the impossibility to demagnetize the system in the low disordered phase has already been observed in three dimensional numerical simulations @xcite .",
