    "+ finally , consider the reassignments @xmath438 where @xmath439 .",
    "then using these new choices of @xmath440 we can carry out all the constructions above in the same way , and corresponding conclusion are still be correct .",
    "for instance , in the case that @xmath330 is odd , one can see for each @xmath137 that @xmath441 and @xmath442 define isotopic ( constant isotopy ) contact structures on @xmath443 , and so , theorem [ thm : isotopic_to_isotopic ] , the bundle contact structures @xmath444 on @xmath445 are isotopic .",

    "@xmath330 is even ) the contact structure @xmath446 on @xmath427 ( resp .",
