    "recently , there has been considerable progress in the thermodynamic description of small ( bio- ) systems @xcite which are prone to thermal fluctuations and typically driven far out of equilibrium . it has been shown that thermodynamic quantities obey various exact work and fluctuation theorems @xcite . the jarzynski relation connects the equilibrium free energy difference with an average of work values obtained from a series of nonequilibrium transitions @xcite .",
    "while biomolecules are typically described by a langevin equation where effects of the thermal bath are included in friction and fluctuation terms , the jarzynski relation has originally been derived in the framework of purely hamiltonian dynamics with initial canonical equilibrium distribution @xcite .",
    "this situation corresponds to an experiment where the heat bath of temperature @xmath0 is decoupled from a small hamiltonian system at time @xmath1 . during a time intevall",
    "@xmath2 $ ] a control parameter @xmath3 is varied time - dependently .",
    "such dynamics has been used in various generalizations of the jarzynski relation @xcite and for the optimization of the free energy reconstruction from nonequilibrium work data @xcite .    while this approach is elegant from a theoretical point of view , it is important to note that such a dynamics has quite different properties than a system subject to a permanent heat bath modelled _",
    "e. g. _ by a langevin equation .",
    "the most important difference concerns the quasistatic work which is achieved for infinitesimally slow transitions @xmath4 , independent of the detailed shape of the protocol for the control parameter @xmath3 . for a system coupled permanently to a heat bath conserving the canonical distribution for fixed control parameter , this quasistatic work is equivalent to the free energy difference .",
    "this property gives rise to the free energy calculation method termed thermodynamic integration where the free energy is approximated by the work for a very slow transition .",
    "for purely hamiltonian dynamics , however , the quasistatic work ( which then is called adiabatic work ) can exceed the free energy difference @xcite .",
    "still , the jarzynski relation is valid and can be used to estimate free energy differences .",
    "it can be shown that under reasonable assumptions ( mainly ergodicity ) , both the work is a monotonically decreasing function of the transition time @xmath5 for a given protocol shape and the adiabatic work is independent of the shape of the protocol @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable interest in deriving fluctuation theorems and analogues of the jarzynski relation also for systems in the quantum domain @xcite . here",
    ", it is more subtle than in the classical case to define thermodynamic quantities such as work on a single trajectory @xcite .",
    "apart from recent progresses for open quantum systems @xcite , most studies @xcite consider the case where the energy is measured at beginning and end , defining the work as the difference between final and initial energy .",
    "these studies rely on schrdinger dynamics which has similar properties as hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "in particular , the quasistatic work then is also different from the free energy difference .    in this paper",
    ", we study optimal protocols of the control parameter @xmath6 leading to a minimal mean work for a finite given transition time @xmath5 .",
    "this question has been tackled for langevin dynamics in harmonic potentials @xcite with the result of unexpected singularities such as jumps in the overdamped case and even delta - type singularities in the underdamped case . for purely hamiltonian or schrdinger dynamics in harmonic potentials",
    ", we will show that the optimal protocol is degenerate and that the optimal work is equal to the adiabatic work .",
    "this result implies that the adiabatic work , which is achieved for an infinitely long transition time for any protocol , can be reached in an arbitrarily short time by using an appropriate protocol for the control parameter .",
    "this surprising result shows that purely hamiltonian dynamics can beat langevin evolution since for the latter short transition times , @xmath7 , yield the work for an instantaneous jump . in the totally different context of collective escape over a barrier",
    ", it has been shown that hamiltonian dynamics also beats langevin dynamics in the sense that it leads to a faster escape @xcite .",
    "we will also calculate the optimal work numerically for an anharmonic potential .",
    "however , it is difficult to decide from the numerical data , whether the adiabatic work can be achieved in a finite transition time also for such an anharmonic potential .",
    "in this section , we will study minimum work protocols for hamiltonian dynamics in three different types of time - dependent potentials : ( i ) a moving harmonic potential , ( ii ) a harmonic potential with time - dependent stiffness and ( iii ) an anharmonic quartic potential .",
    "we consider a particle of mass @xmath8 subject to a moving harmonic potential @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ( constant ) stiffness of the potential .",
    "the minimum of the potential @xmath6 is changed time - dependently from an initial position @xmath11 to a final position @xmath12 .",
    "the hamiltonian dynamics of position and momentum of the particle at time @xmath13 then is governed by the equations of motion @xmath14 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath15 and the dot the derivative with respect to the time @xmath13 .",
    "the particle initially is in thermal equilibrium with probability density @xmath16 \\exp[-\\beta p_0 ^ 2 / ( 2 m ) ] \\label{eq : ham_rho}\\ ] ] for the initial position @xmath17 and the initial momentum @xmath18 with normalization constant @xmath19 and inverse temperature @xmath20 with boltzmann s constant @xmath21 .",
    "since there is no heat transfer during the ( purely hamiltonian ) transition , the work is given by the change of internal energy .",
    "averaging over all initial conditions yields the mean work @xmath22_0^t \\nonumber \\\\ & = &   \\left [ \\frac { { \\left \\langle p^2 \\right \\rangle } } { 2 m } + \\frac{k}{2 } \\left ( { \\left \\langle x^2 \\right \\rangle } - 2 \\lambda { \\left \\langle x \\right \\rangle } + \\lambda^2 \\right )   \\right]_0^t \\label{eq : ham_w_mov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the average over the initial distribution of position and momentum ( [ eq : ham_rho ] ) .",
    "it can easily be shown that the variances @xmath24 and @xmath25 are time independent for any protocol @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the work ( [ eq : ham_w_mov ] ) can be written as @xmath26_0^t \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\left [ \\frac { { \\left \\langle p \\right \\rangle}^2 } { 2 m } + \\frac{k}{2 } \\left ( { \\left \\langle x \\right",
    "\\rangle}-\\lambda \\right ) ^2   \\right]_0^t\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which becomes zero , _ i.e. _ , minimal for @xmath27 the evolution equations for these mean values are given by @xmath28 with initial values @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "with the freedom to choose the continuous function @xmath6 which corresponds to an infinite number of free parameters , it is quite obvious that the two final conditions can easily be met .",
    "in fact , the optimal protocol is highly degenerate .    for a specific choice , taking , _",
    "e. g. _ , a third order polynomial @xmath31 with two free parameters @xmath32 suffices to meet the optimality conditions .",
    "the solution of the evolution equations ( [ eq : ham : mean ] ) can be solved analytically and , inserted into equation ( [ eq : ham_mov_cond ] ) , leads to @xmath33 with @xmath34 . for short transitions times @xmath35 ,",
    "the coefficients diverge as @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    as a quite different choice",
    ", both conditions can also be met by a linear protocol with delta singularities at the boundaries , in analogy to the underdamped stochastic dynamics case @xcite .",
    "indeed , it can easily be verified that the protocol @xmath38\\ ] ] fulfills the conditions ( [ eq : ham_mov_cond ] ) .",
    "this expression could also have been obtained as the limit of the underdamped optimal protocol for a vanishing friction coefficient @xmath39 .",
    "thus , for any given total transition time @xmath5 the minimal mean work is given by @xmath40 for infinitely long transition times , quite generally , the work is given by the adiabatic work .",
    "for the studied model system , we have @xmath41 .",
    "as shown above , this lower bound on the work can even be achieved for arbitrarily short transition time .",
    "this surprising result shows that purely hamiltonian dynamics can beat langevin evolution where short transition times @xmath7 yield the work for an instantaneous jump @xmath42 .",
    "the optimal protocols show a distinct positive peak in the first part of the transition and a distinct negative peak in the second part of the transition . this peak structure can be understood intuitively in complete analogy to the underdamped dynamics case @xcite .",
    "the first peak accelerates the particle and leads to a finite mean velocity which is necessary to reach a final mean particle position at the potential minimum .",
    "the second negative peak decelerates the particle , thus recovering the invested work from the kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "we consider the time dependent potential @xmath43 where the stiffness @xmath6 is changed from an initial value @xmath44 to a final value @xmath45 in a finite time @xmath5 .",
    "the work exerted on the system during the finite time transition is given by the change in internal energy @xmath46_0^t =   \\left [ \\frac { { \\left \\langle p^2 \\right \\rangle } } { 2 m } + \\frac \\lambda 2 { \\left \\langle x^2 \\right \\rangle } \\right]_0^t.\\ ] ] the dynamics ( [ eq : ham_dyn ] ) leads to coupled evolution equations for the mean squared position @xmath47 and the mean squared momentum @xmath48 @xmath49 multiplication of equation ( [ eq : ham_ddotw ] ) with a factor @xmath50 and insertion of equation ( [ eq : ham_dotz ] ) leads to the relation @xmath51 which , using the equilibrium initial conditions @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 can be integrated to yield @xmath55 at the final time @xmath5 , minimization requires @xmath56 which is equivalent to the final condition @xmath57 the ( mean ) total work thus becomes @xmath58.\\ ] ] optimizing this expression with respect to @xmath59 leads to @xmath60 which yields the optimal work @xmath61 similar to the first case study , the optimal protocol is highly degenerate . for a third order polynomial ,",
    "the equations of motion can not be solved analytically . however , as expected , the two parameters can be chosen such that the boundary conditions ( [ eq : ham_z_opt ] ) and ( [ eq : ham_w_opt ] ) are fulfilled . optimal third order polynomial protocols @xmath62 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ham_stiff_prot ] for different transition times @xmath5 .",
    "a short transition time requires pronounced peaks with increasing height for decreasing transition times .",
    "these peaks serve to accelerate the brownian particle in the first part of the transition and to deccelerate the particle in the second part of the transition .",
    "another convenient choice is a linear protocol with superimposed delta peak singularities at beginning and end .",
    "the initial singularity allows for setting the initial mean squared momentum instantaneously to a value @xmath63 which can be tuned to meet the boundary condition on @xmath64 .",
    "the second delta singularity at the final time @xmath5 allows for setting @xmath56 .",
    "note that , similar to the first case study , the minimal work ( [ eq : meanw_ham ] ) does not depend on the transition time @xmath5 .",
    "naively , in the limit @xmath7 , one would expect the result obtained for an instantaneous jump of the protocol @xmath65 which is substantially larger than the optimal work .",
    "however , the possibility to use a protocol with increasing absolute values of @xmath3 ( and thus increasing forces ) for decreasing transition times @xmath5 leads to the singular limit at @xmath7 . for any fixed shape of the protocol @xmath66 , the work approaches @xmath67 with @xmath7 .      in both harmonic case studies , the optimal work @xmath68 is given by the adiabatic work @xmath69 , independent of the total transition time @xmath5",
    "the optimal protocols @xmath70 are highly degenerate .",
    "it is interesting to see whether these ( unexpected ) features persist for anharmonic potentials where the optimality conditions can not be cast into only two conditions for the moments of the probability distribution .",
    "however , it is computationally quite difficult to determine optimal protocols in the anharmonic case . for a case study , we use the quartic potential @xmath71 with @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 together with a fourier ansatz for the optimal protocol @xmath75 where we omit higher odd frequencies because their symmetry is not suitable to produce the peak structure found in the two harmonic cases .",
    "we next optimize the parameters @xmath76 for a minimal mean work which we calculate as the average of work values from @xmath77 randomly sampled initial values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "for the minimization , we use a standard mathematica algorithm . note that the optimal work values obtained in this numerical procedure are upper bounds for the true optimal work since we have used a finite number of parameters .",
    "the adiabatic work can be calculated using the microcanonical distribution for given energy @xmath78 and given @xmath3 .",
    "the change of internal energy then is given by @xmath79 with the microcanonical partition function @xmath80 the evolution equation ( [ eq : ham_dgl_qs ] ) is an ordinary differential equation for @xmath81 .",

    "[ fig : ham_x4_w]a , we compare optimal work values with the adiabatic work .",
    "even though it looks like convergence may be reached already by the small number of fourier modes , we can not decide this question conclusively . particularly for very small transition times ,",
    "optimal protocols feature extreme protocol values which may require a large number of fourier modes .",
    "moreover , we can not exclude the possibility that the minimum search is trapped in a local minimum preventing the convergence towards the global minimum .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude the possibility that the adiabatic work can be reached in a finite time also in this case study .",
    "more likely , however , is the following scenario : the optimal work is discontinuous at @xmath88 .",
    "for any transition time , work values well below the work for an instantaneous jump @xmath89 but above the adiabatic work can be obtained .",
    "clearly , even for very fast transitions compared to the characteristic oscillation time @xmath90 , the optimal work is well below the work for a linear protocol which has the limit @xmath89 for @xmath7 .",

    "in this section , we investigate optimal protocols for quantum system . fortunately , for harmonic systems which are comparable to the first two case studies from the previous sections , work distributions @xmath91",

    ", it is easy to derive optimal protocols since in both cases , the work distributions ( and therefore also the mean work ) depend on a single `` rapidity '' parameter which vanishes for quasistatic transitions . in the last subsection",
    ", we study the two level system of a single spin in a time dependent magnetic field .",
    "if we impose that the absolute value of the magnetic field stays fixed , the adiabatic work can only be reached in a finite ( non - zero ) time .",

    "<S> for systems in an externally controllable time - dependent potential , the optimal protocol minimizes the mean work spent in a finite - time transition between given initial and final values of a control parameter . for an initially thermalized ensemble , </S>",
    "<S> we consider both hamiltonian evolution for classical systems and schrdinger evolution for quantum systems . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> , we show that for harmonic potentials , the optimal work is given by the adiabatic work even in the limit of short transition times . </S>",
    "<S> this result is counter - intuitive because the adiabatic work is substantially smaller than the work for an instantaneous jump . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform numerical calculations of the optimal protocol for hamiltonian dynamics in an anharmonic quartic potential . for a two - level spin system , </S>",
    "<S> we give examples where the adiabatic work can be reached in either a finite or an arbitrarily short transition time depending on the allowed parameter space . </S>"
