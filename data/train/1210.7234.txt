    "electron transfer ( et ) between molecular systems has long been recognized as a key process in many research fields of chemistry , physics and biology@xcite .",
    "many of its aspects are described by the marcus theory@xcite , which has been extended to describe such areas as artificial solar - energy conversion@xcite and molecular electronics@xcite .",
    "the marcus theory relies in an essential way on electron - vibration interaction .",
    "the initial and final states of the electron transfer process are fully equilibrated polarons localized on different sites , and transitions between them is evaluated within the assumptions of transition state theory .",
    "motion in an extended system is assumed to be a succession of hopping steps , each described as a marcus process . in the other extreme limit , electronic motion in a frozen lattice , the electron moves within its energy band , most simply described using a tight binding model . in between these limits , electron - phonon interaction and band motion",
    "can change the electron s character from being weakly perturbed by electron - phonon scattering to polaronic motion whose discrete representation is the succession of hopping processes described above .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in situations where electronic band motion competes on the same timescale with polaron formation , so that the dynamics of the latter process has to be considered explicitly .",
    "such considerations are relevant to recently studied models of photovoltaic cells@xcite , where electrons ( or holes ) are injected at some location in the system and a useful process is defined by their absorption at another ( e.g. an electrode surface ) .",
    "the yield of such processes , determined by the competition between electronic motion and loss processes@xcite ( e.g. carrier recombination ) is expected to be sensitive to electron - phonon interactions , and in particular to transient polaron formation .",
    "exact treatment of such coupled many - body systems is difficult , and it is tempting to resort to approximations such as the semiclassical mean field ( ehrenfest ) dynamics . in this approximation",
    "the electronic wavefunction @xmath0 ( r represents the electronic coordinates and t is the time ) evolves under a time - dependent hamiltonian defined by a classical nuclear trajectory , schematically represented by a nuclear coordinate @xmath1 , while the latter is obtained by solving the newton equation for the nuclear motion with a potential in which the vibronic coupling @xmath2 is replaced by its instantaneous expectation value @xmath3 .",
    "such an approximation , essentially a dynamical extension of the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation , is expected to perform well when the electronic motion is fast , throughout the relevant electronic subspace , relative to the nuclear dynamics .",
    "its failure in describing processes in which transitions between bo electronic adiabatic states take place on the same timescale as nuclear motions is also well known .",
    "indeed , in the analogous case of electron solvation in polar liquids such non - adiabatic processes have been addressed with the necessary accounting for the quantum nature of the nuclear motion@xcite , usually within the surface hopping methodology@xcite .",
    "still , because ehrenfest dynamics is so easy to implement and to use , it is of interest to assess its performance as an approximation to exact results in the context described above@xcite .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper . using a model that is simple enough to solve up to any desired level of accuracy , we focus on two observables : the extent of the polaronic localization and its formation time , and compare results obtained from the semiclassical ehrenfest dynamics approach to the exact , fully quantum , results . for model parameters that support polaron formation",
    "we find that , while the ehrenfest calculation yields a similar final state as the exact one , it predicts a polaron formation time that is an order of magnitude longer than the exact result .",
    "this implies that ehrenfest dynamics can not be used as a reliable tool for assessing polaronic effects in such systems .",
    "this does not exclude its possible applicability in larger systems with higher temperatures with many more nuclear degrees of freedom , but indicates that its use should be exercised with caution and after performing suitable benchmark calculations .",
    "we start by formulating the basic hamiltonian model and comparing the different predictions of the quantum and the semiclassical descriptions in section ii . in section",
    "iii we define the population operator and the population formation time . numerical calculation and discussions",
    "are given in sections iv and v , and a conclusion follows .",
    "we consider an n+1-site tight - binding free electron model ( below we take n=4 ) coupled to a system of harmonic oscillators .",
    "we assume that only one oscillator ( henceforth referred to as the primaryvibration ) directly couple to the electronic systems .",
    "the others ( secondaryphonons ) constitute a thermal bath that affects relaxation in the primary system .",
    "the hamiltonian of the whole system is @xmath4    here @xmath5 corresponds to the electronic system ( described by the creation and annihilation operators for each site @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , together with the primary vibration , of frequency @xmath9 described by the creation and annihilation operators @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 describes the secondary phonon bath ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the creation and annihilation operators for phonon of frequency @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 is the coupling between the primary vibration and secondary phonons .",
    "@xmath17 is the on - site energy level of site @xmath6 , @xmath18 is the coupling parameter associated with electron tunneling between nearest neighbor sites . the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the coupling between the electronic state at site 2 and the primary vibration , and between the primary vibration and secondary phonons , respectively .          in the quantum approach ,",
    "the evolution described by the hamiltonian ( 2 ) is treated essentially exactly@xcite , using the basis set @xmath21 where n and @xmath22 denote the electronic state localized on site @xmath23 and the vibrational state @xmath22 of the primary oscillator . in the numerical calculation",
    "we truncate the set @xmath24 at some value , @xmath25 and test for convergence as @xmath25 increases .",
    "the coupling to the thermal bath is treated in the master equation approach : the density matrix @xmath26 of the whole system is assumed to keep the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , the density matrix of the thermal bath ( secondary phonons ) , is assumed to remain in equilibrium at the ambient temperature .",

    "- it is sufficient to consider the zero temperature case .    for the quantum method , we need to set @xmath25 large enough to assure convergence of the calculation . because we are at zero temperature , the energy transfer only happens from the higher levels to its nearest lower level and a smaller @xmath73 is enough ( in the supporting information fig .",
    "s1 shows that when @xmath25 is larger than 2 the average population @xmath74 is similar ) . for non - zero temperature",
    ", there will be transfer from lower to higher levels , and larger @xmath25 will be needed .",
    "the electron - vibration coupling is allowed only at site 2 and the system is coupled to the bath by a single primary vibration . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] , for a small @xmath18 , much of the electron population will localize on site 2 , forming a local polaron with larger population .",
    "the quantum results ( section ii ) are shown on left panel and the semiclassical results ( section iii ) are displayed in the right panel .",
    "the respective results qualitatively similar:@xmath74 ( polaron population ) rises and saturates at values that are similar in both approaches .",
    "however the rise time obtained from the quantum calculation is much shorter than its semiclassical counterpart : @xmath74 reaches its maximum value at 2 ps ( picosecond ) in the left panel , while in the right panel it takes about 15 ps .",
    "this difference demonstrates the shortcoming of the semiclassical approximation , or rather - its reliance on the mean field approximation : the localizing phonon moves on a potential surface that is substantially different from what it actually experiences once the localization process has started .",
    "the coupling @xmath18 between nearest neighbor sites is important for population localization . for small @xmath18",
    "the coherent transfer between the different sites is weak and the population tends to localize , forming a polaron on site 2 which is coupled to the primary vibration and has been given a lower energy .",
    "for large @xmath18 the population tends to equalize on neighboring sites , showing an oscillatory behavior ( here only the average is shown ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] , the average population @xmath74 on the impurity site decreases with increasing @xmath18 , although the polaron is in principle formed on site 2 .",
    "for @xmath75 , the banding or delocalisation energy dominates over the electron phonon and impurity energies . in this limit",
    ", the charge population will tend to reach a uniform average value . recall that the original small - polaron model of holstein@xcite was developed for narrow - band ( small @xmath18 ) materials .",
    "@xmath19 is the coupling strength between the electronic motion and the vibration at site 2 . in the quantum method",
    ", electrons can evolve from the other sites to the vibronic states through this coupling as shown in the last term on the right side of eq .",
    "[ hs ] . with larger @xmath19 , more population will transfer and form a polaron with large population on the middle site .",
    "for the semiclassical case , the same thing will occur through eq .",
    "[ ft ] , and some population will be localized to form a polaron . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.4 ] , the population @xmath74 in the steady state increases with this coupling strength .",
    "the more rapid population relaxation obtained in the quantum treatment occurs because in the quantum analysis , the actual population at site 2 is used , while in the semiclassical treatment , it is necessarily only the average population which drives the coupling .    in figs .",
    "[ f.5-a ] and  [ f.5-b ] , @xmath58 ( defined in eq .  [ lifetime ] ) is plotted in 3-d by changing the coupling @xmath18 and the electron - phonon coupling @xmath19 . with a small @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath58 is almost around 0.5 .",
    "choosing larger values of @xmath18 , decreases the site 2 population as can be expected , as shown in the corners of figs .",
    "[ f.5-a ] and  [ f.5-b ] .",
    "however increasing @xmath19 , the population builds up again , and we can say that the polaron population value is mainly determined by the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 .      in figs .",
    "[ f.6-a ] and  [ f.6-b ] the population formation time is shown in 3-d by changing both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the formation time obtained by the semiclassical method is longer than the quantum method .",
    "the population formation time decreases with electron - phonon coupling @xmath19 but then saturates",
    ". it also decreases with coupling @xmath18 , but there is a turnover in the formation time beyond a v@xmath550.1ev .",
    "this is due to the fact that for large @xmath18 , the excitation relaxes into a delocalized population which is no longer strictly speaking a localized polaron .",
    "the population distribution is roughly constant in this limit as shown in fig .",
    "the formation time should now be referred to simply as population relaxation time .      in fig .",
    "[ f.7-a ] we compare the time - dependent dynamic processes for @xmath54 and @xmath60 ( eq .  [ energyep ] ) . both of them reach their steady state very quickly .",
    "when @xmath54 reaches its maximum , @xmath76 is at minimum , and vice versa .",
    "this represents the damping of a coherent oscillator where displacement and population keep their phase delay throughout .",
    "the picture ( fig .  [ f.7-b ] ) is somewhat different in the semiclassical case , @xmath54 and its @xmath77 are also delayed but we now see beats due to the interference of waves scattering from an oscillating potential .",
    "both quantities reach their steady state more slowly in this case .",
    "in this paper we have compared a fully quantum and semiclassical model .",
    "the latter based on ehrenfest dynamics for the calculation of the polaron formation process .",
    "we used a 1-dimensional tight binding model that includes electron - phonon coupling but only one site , the so called polaron trap , the trap phononis in turn coupled to a thermal bath which allows the system to relax into an equilibrium .",
    "the results from both methods show qualitatively similar behavior , however with markedly different timescales : the population formation time obtained from the quantum calculation can be 10 times faster compared to the semiclassical method . this discrepancy becomes smaller with increasing intersite coupling @xmath18 ( for large @xmath18 no localized polaron is formed ) since the classical limit is reached for @xmath78 .",
    "the different relaxation times obtained in the quantum and the semiclassical calculations result from the use of mean field approximation in the latter . in this approximation ,",
    "the primary oscillator responds to the average occupation of site 2 which effectively makes it move on a potential surface that is markedly different ( less binding ) than the one it experiences once localization is initiated .",
    "localization on this average potential is slower .",
    "this averaging assumption may be justified when the electron motion is much faster than the vibration , that is , for large @xmath18 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "another minor difference between the two calculations is the use of a master equation in the quantum calculation , and an essentially equivalent langevin equation in the semiclassical one , to describe the relaxation of the primary phonon .",
    "these relaxation schemes are equivalent , provided that care is taken to use parameters that imply the same relaxation rate in both cases , as was done here .",
    "the conclusion would also apply to the exactsimulations of kopidakis et al@xcite and the many other papers where the vibrations are also treated with semiclassical dynamics .",
    "it would seem that depending on electron bandwidth , the formation time is considerably underestimated in these works , perhaps by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "the semiclassical results are essentially in agreement with the conclusions reached by emin and kriman@xcite using the holstein diatomic polaron lattice model .",
    "these authors showed that population localization and polaron formation depend critically on the ratio of the tunneling energy @xmath18 and the width of the bloch phonon dispersion , which effectively plays the role of the dissipation term since outward traveling phonon bloch waves will not return .",
    "one final but very important point .",
    "we have shown that for simple relaxation models , the true thermodynamic equilibrium is not necessarily the one reached in the steady state .",
    "the state reached with arbitrary start conditions can , in terms of energy , be a metastable state the populartion on site 2 ( lower energy ) never exceeds however small we make v. introducing even a small coupling on the other sites then allows the system to reach the true ground state and now the population can climb up to 1 .",
    "this very interesting point needs to be investigated in detail and in particular at finite temperature .",
