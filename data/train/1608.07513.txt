    "in recent years , iridates have drawn considerable research interest in the condensed matter physics community due to their comparable energy scales of strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , coulomb interaction , crystal field , and exchange interactions . through the change of local environment and symmetry , the electronic structure as well as",
    "the magnetic and transport properties can be tuned . by a small rearrangement of these interaction energies , interesting physical properties like : topologically insulating behavior @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , weyl semimetallic state @xcite , quantum spin liquid phases @xcite etc .",
    "are predicted in these materials .",
    "an interesting scenario appears for the perovskite iridium oxides where the 5@xmath5 ir ions are located within octahedral oxygen cages . for systems with ir@xmath6 ions , the strong soc couples the spins of 5@xmath5-electrons residing on the @xmath7 orbital to its orbital momentum .",
    "the resulting doubly degenerate ground state can be described by an effective total angular momentum ( or pseudospin ) @xmath8 = @xmath4 which can have properties very different from the spin - only @xmath9 state such as in the 3@xmath5 cu@xmath10 ions . in the band picture ,",
    "an overlap of the @xmath8 pseudospin states gives rise to a @xmath11 mott insulator state @xcite .",
    "in fact , the details of this @xmath12 picture , and how the non - cubic crystal field can tune the corresponding band structure are still not clear and are under investigation .",
    "another level of complexity arises when strongly correlated 3@xmath5 ions with almost completely quenched orbital moment coexist with strongly spin - orbit coupled 5@xmath5 ions in the b - site of a double perovskite .",
    "an interesting physics emerging from such compounds promises to open up new pathways to develop novel materials with desired magnetic functionalities for advanced technological applications .",
    "the ground - state magnetic properties are also found to be versatile in these double perovskites .",

    ", the magnetic properties are determined by the strong exchange anisotropy induced by the afm superexchange interactions between the total angular momentum @xmath12 = @xmath4 of the ir@xmath6 ions and electronic spins @xmath15 of cu@xmath10 ions .    in this paper , we report the results of a systematic investigation of the double perovskite la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 with state - of - the - art magnetometry , neutron diffraction , neutron depolarization , specific heat , muon - spin - relaxation ( @xmath2sr ) , electron - spin - resonance ( esr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) to unveil its complex magnetic behavior .",

    "a maximum of @xmath249 is found at @xmath264 k. such a peak , in a magnetic system with a simple one - component order parameter associated with the magnetic fluctuation rate being equal to the muon spin precession frequency , is expected to be located very close to the magnetic ordering temperature @xmath265k , at which the spin correlation time diverges .",
    "however , in this system , we observe the onset of the strong increase of @xmath249 at @xmath231 .",
    "the reason for this observation is not clear yet . in la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 ,",
    "two different spin - spin correlations are found : strong longitudinal afm correlations diverge at 75 k and weak transverse fm - like correlations diverge at 54 k. both processes contribute to the spin lattice relaxation rate , however with different amplitudes @xmath266 ( form factors ) at the site of the probe . the amplitude of the fm correlations , even though caused by small transverse magnetic moments of the order of 1/1000 @xmath132 can have a similar absolute value as the amplitude of the strong afm correlations .",
    "therefore , in this system the superposition of two broad peaks may lead to the observed maximum in the muon spin lattice relaxation at 60 k.    in the inset of fig.[fig : usr2](b ) we plot the static line width @xmath247 normalized by the muon spin precession frequency @xmath250 .",
    "this is a measure of the homogeneity of the magnetic ordering .",
    "a constant value below 50 k proves a homogenous - system state without changes of the magnetic sublattice below this temperature . above 50",
    "k the ratio @xmath247/@xmath250 is increasing towards @xmath231 .",
    "this is often found in magnetic systems close to the magnetic transition temperature since the magnetic coherence length is reduced close to @xmath231 which gives rise to an increased static disorder . in la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 also a disordered state of transverse canted moments above 54 k",
    "may contribute to the increased static disorder .",
    "in this work , we presented the structural , magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the double perovskite la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 comprising interpenetrating and interacting sublattices of the cu@xmath10 spins @xmath267 and ir@xmath6 pseudospins @xmath268 = 1/2 .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of xrd and neutron diffraction patterns reveals that the crystal structure of la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 is indeed triclinic @xmath97 in contrast to the reported monoclinic @xmath81 .",
    "the _ dc _ magnetization studies reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at @xmath103k and the formation of a small uncompensated moment at even lower temperatures .",
    "the occurrence of the magnetic phase transition at @xmath106 is confirmed by the specific heat measurements .",
    "_ ac _ susceptibility measurements prove a weak dynamic anomaly at @xmath185k which is suppressed in applied _ dc _ fields . a curie ",
    "weiss fit of the inverse _ dc _ susceptibility yields @xmath269k and the hysteresis loop opens up below @xmath18 .",
    "the temperature dependent neutron diffraction and @xmath2sr data analysis assigns @xmath106 as the onset of afm ordering with a commensurate magnetic structure .",
    "the spin configuration might be of a non - collinear type with an orthogonal orientation of magnetic moments in the neighboring afm planes stacked along the crystallographic @xmath91 axis .",
    "a smooth development of a static muon spin precession frequency proves a common magnetic ordering of strongly coupled cu spins and ir pseudospins . the specific heat",
    ", esr and neutron depolarization studies reveal that short - range magnetic correlations appear at much higher temperature than @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , a crossover from a purely paramagnetic resonance regime to the development of a collective resonance mode in the short range ordered state of la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 is observed by esr for @xmath270k .",
    "very interestingly , @xmath2sr and nmr relaxation measurements reveal a residual spin dynamics at @xmath271 .",
    "an occurrence of a small spontaneous ferromagnetic magnetization in antiferromagnets with the canted spin structure has been first understood in the pioneering works by dzyaloshinsky and moriya ( dm ) @xcite . unlike in ferromagnets ,",
    "this small magnetization is not related to the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the spins .",
    "it is caused by the special antisymmetric anisotropic dm exchange interaction which arises due to the relativistic spin  orbit coupling in the absence of the inversion symmetry between the spins and adds to the usual antiferromagnetic heisenberg exchange hamiltonian .",
    "the dm interaction yields a small canting of the otherwise antiparallel spin sublattices .",
    "the resulting net `` fm  like '' transversal moment is usually just a fraction of the total spin moment .",
    "the experimental results obtained in the present work give strong arguments of a non - collinear antiferromagnetism of la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 [ one of the possible spin canting scenarios is sketched in fig.[fig : xrd](c ) ] .",
    "though this canting could not be directly observed in the magnetic neutron diffraction , it is obviously due to the smallness of the associated net moment of the order of @xmath272 .",
    "however , these small moments are responsible for rather peculiar magnetic properties of la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 .",
    "the weak ferromagnetism becomes visible already in the dynamic regime above @xmath273k giving rise to the neutron spin depolarization and a collective esr mode of the oscillating net moments .",
    "magnetic neutron diffraction and @xmath2sr data evidence static afm order of both cu and ir sublattices at @xmath106 .",
    "however , it appears that the transverse net moments still exhibit a certain dynamical behavior below @xmath106 visible in the nmr and @xmath2sr relaxation rates .",
    "it can be understood as small incoherent fluctuations of the ordered sublattices around their equilibrium ( antiferromagnetic ) positions .",
    "finally at @xmath185k , the net moments get statically locked giving rise to a weak anomaly in the magnetization at small fields .",
    "the multi - facet role of the spin ",
    "orbit coupling occurring at the different energy scales in la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 should be pointed out here : ( i ) the strong intra - ionic soc of ir@xmath6 of the order 0.5 ev ( @xmath2746 000 k ) couples the spin and orbital momentum giving rise to an effective @xmath268 = 1/2 ground state of ir@xmath6 ions ; ( ii ) the soc of both ir@xmath6 and cu@xmath10 eventually selects specific spatial spin directions in the magnetically ordered state at @xmath273k via symmetric corrections to the heisenberg superexchange ( the pure heisenberg - only isotropic spins would be insensitive to the lattice directions ) ; ( iii ) due to the very low crystallographic symmetry of la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 that allows the antisymmetric dm interaction soc finally yields weak transversal ( weak fm ) moments that get static at @xmath185k due to a residual magnetic anisotropy .",
    "currently , it is not possible to further detail the spin structure of la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 . in particular , it is not clear if both cu and ir spin sublattices or only one of them are tilted and into which direction .",
    "the sketch in fig.[fig : xrd](c ) visualizes one of the possible spin patterns compatible with our data . all spins are lying in the @xmath275-plane , within each layer the structure is almost collinear , and the spins in two layers are orthogonal to each other .",
    "the spin canting is strongly exaggerated in the sketch .",
    "it is assumed that both ir and cu sublattices are canted .",
    "this is likely to be the case since the dm interaction should act both within and between the different sublattices .",
    "obviously , our results call for further work on the present compound la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 and other @xmath276 mixed double perovskites to elucidate the impact of the interplay between the strong spin - orbit coupling and the crystal structure on the magnetism of this new class of complex transition oxides .",

    "<S> we report the structural , magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the double perovskite compound la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 from x - ray , neutron diffraction , neutron depolarization , _ dc _ magnetization , _ ac _ susceptibility , specific heat , muon - spin - relaxation ( @xmath2sr ) , electron - spin - resonance ( esr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic sublattices of cu ( spin @xmath3 = @xmath4 ) and ir ( pseudospin _ j _ = @xmath4 ) in la@xmath0cuiro@xmath1 are strongly coupled and exhibit an antiferromagnetic phase transition at 74 k into a non - collinear magnetic structure accompanied by a small uncompensated transverse moment . </S>",
    "<S> a weak anomaly in _ ac_-susceptibility as well as in the nmr and @xmath2sr spin lattice relaxation rates at 54 k is interpreted as a cooperative ordering of the transverse moments . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation unveils the complex magnetic interactions present in the compound where strongly correlated spin - only 3__d _ </S>",
    "<S> _ ions coexist with strongly spin - orbit coupled 5__d _ _ transition metal ions . </S>"
