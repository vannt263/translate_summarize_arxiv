    "dijets are the aftermath of @xmath1 scattering in perturbative qcd : when the scattering is at a momentum scale significantly above @xmath2 , perturbation theory works well to determine the inclusive cross section .",
    "the two outgoing partons are born high in virtuality and evolve down through collinear processes ; this leads to two narrow cones of partons centered on axes determined by the original partons momenta .",
    "hadronization is non - perturbative and soft , and leads to hadrons centered on these axes .",
    "because the initial partons had relatively small total transverse momenta , the total transverse momenta in the two jets should be roughly balanced : @xmath3 .",
    "this picture leads one to think that the total cross section for dijets can be easily compared with perturbative calculations for inclusive @xmath1 scattering .",
    "however , even in proton - proton collisions with relatively small backgrounds , a method for deciding what particles belong in a jet must be made .",
    "a deceivingly simple method is to use the anti-@xmath4 algorithm @xcite : a metric defines a  distance \" between two 4-momenta ; for infrared and collinear @xmath5 processes , this metric is defined so that the distance between the two final momenta are small . a list of distances between all pairs of momenta in a given event",
    "is then determined and ordered from smallest to largest , and the list is shrunken by combining these momenta , starting at the beginning of the list and stopping once all distances are above some lower limit .",
    "the final momenta , when they are sufficiently large , can be called reconstructed jets . because the shortest distances are added first , the algorithm is insensitive to infrared and collinear physics .    the large cross sections for jet production , as well as the large energy separation between jet energies and the highest temperatures reached , allowed jets to be one of the first heavy - ion observables examined at the large hadron collider @xcite .",
    "a large sample of dijets were reconstructed from lead - lead events measured at atlas , and the distributions in dijet asymmetry @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the energy of the ( second-)largest jet , were determined for several centrality classes . in the 0 - 10% centrality class , the distribution @xmath9 was determined to be flat from @xmath10 up to @xmath11 , significantly different from all preceding proton - proton analyses where the distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the propagation of the partons of a jet through a deconfining , thermal medium .",
    "determining the propagation perturbatively leads first to considering elastic @xmath12 scattering at tree - level , and using the hard thermal loop ( htl ) approximation leads to the rate @xmath13 { \\rm . }",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] when interference between multiple elastic scatters is small , these rates can be convoluted with a distribution of partons and calculated in the rest frames of the medium and at temperatures determined by a model for the heavy - ion collision .",
    "figure [ elasticvsradiative ] shows how convoluting elastic rates can lead to some dijet asymmetry .",
    "using @xmath14 , and only elastic processes , does not lead to a large average dijet asymmetry .    however , elastic scattering is not the only process contributing to the evolution of jets at leading order in @xmath15 . at high energies , @xmath16 scatterings where @xmath17 become collinearly enhanced .",
    "all that keeps these diagrams from being singular in the collinear limit is the thermal mass squared @xmath18 , which causes scatters with gluon emission to contribute at a smaller order in @xmath15 than one might navely expect .",
    "however , at the high temperatures where htl effective theory applies , the medium is also very dense , meaning that the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect must also be taken into account .",
    "multiple scatterings can be resummed using an integral equation @xcite .",
    "figure [ elasticvsradiative ] also shows the effect of radiative splittings alone .",
    "these radiative splittings , which are in addition to the splittings that occur in the evolution from high to low virtuality , lead to a distribution in dijet asymmetry almost the same as the distribution predicted for proton - proton collisions at this energy .",
    "this should not be a surprise : the anti-@xmath4 algorithm is designed to be insensitive to collinear processes .",
    "however , what happens when both elastic and radiative processes are taken into account ?",
    "radiation evolves the distribution of partons in a jet down to small momentum fractions . with elastic scatterings occurring",
    ", the physics of @xmath19 also is taken into account .",
    "given a parton of momentum @xmath20 , an elastic scattering transferring transverse momentum @xmath21 will deflect the parton by @xmath22 .",
    "thanks to the evolution down to small momentum fractions , many more of these partons will have small @xmath20 and will be deflected more .",
    "this identifies a possible source for dijet asymmetry in the absence of strong energy loss : enhanced decollimation of the jet caused by in - medium jet evolution .",
    "the evolution of a distribution of partons in a thermal medium can be described with this integral equation : @xmath23    if these rates are small unless @xmath24 is small compared with @xmath20 , then one might want to make a  diffusive approximation \" that turns these equations into differential equations .",
    "however , for massless partons , this was demonstrated in figure 3 in @xcite to pose difficulties : the initial distribution @xmath25 was evolved for 5 fm / c according both to integral equations and the fokker - planck equation . while both approaches determined similar mean values ,",
    "the fokker - planck equation predicted a significantly smaller distribution at small @xmath26 than solving the integral equation did .",
    "our description of jet modification depends critically on determining the jet shape properly at small momentum fractions ; it is clear that the full integral equation must be solved .",
    "however , solving these equations in a rapidly evolving and expanding thermal medium is prohibitive and indeed , undesirable .",
    "monte carlo simulations are ideal for solving these integral equations : they are not significantly complicated by the addition of new processes like other numerical solutions , and they are adaptable .",
    "in @xcite , we showed how dijet asymmetry might be described as the result of parton evolution at finite temperature , using martini , an event generator for high - momentum observables in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . with it",
    ", jets were sampled using pythia8 @xcite , and evolved according to finite - temperature rates using the results of music , a solver of the 3 + 1-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical equations which describe well the bulk observables at rhic and the lhc @xcite .",
    "after hadronization , jets are reconstructed using fastjet @xcite , to be consistent with the techniques used by the experimentalists .",
    "the main results of our work on dijets are shown in figure [ allprocesses ] . applying both the elastic and radiative processes to the partons in a jet",
    "leads to agreement with the results of both atlas and cms , using @xmath27 , unlike the results found using elastic or radiative processes alone .",
    "finally , we present preliminary results for the charged particle nuclear modification factor @xmath29 in the 0 - 5% centrality class at the lhc , in figure [ raa ] .",
    "three curves are compared with data : first , the results using the same radiative rates as was used to describe dijet asymmetry are plotted with the solid ( red ) curve . a slow rise in @xmath28 with @xmath30",
    "is observed , consistent with the lpm effect @xcite .",
    "next , the dashed ( green ) curve shows results with a parametrization of finite - size effects . for a medium with finite size",
    ", the interference between vacuum and medium - induced splittings suppresses the radiative rates at early times @xcite .",
    "finally , the dotted ( blue ) curve shows the results taking account of both finite size effects and the running of the coupling .",
    "the momentum scale of the splitting vertex is given by @xmath31 , leading to @xmath32 .",
    "momentum transfers in elastic collisions are space - like and of order @xmath33 and their running is ignored .    at this point , both effects are applied approximately to total radiative rates and not to the differential rates . to include the effect of running coupling without this approximation is simply a matter of recalculating the rates",
    ". however , exact implementation of finite - size effects poses a challenge to monte carlo simulations , because they depend on the previous positions of the partons and the evolution of the medium . perhaps using the initial position of a given parton , and the temperature of the medium at this point , can be used to estimate the temperature profile for the parton s evolution with enough accuracy that the finite - size effect can be taken into account accurately .",
