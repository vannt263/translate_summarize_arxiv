    "recently there have been renewed interests in large - scale interaction in several research disciplines , with its uses in wireless networks , big data , cyber - physical systems , financial markets , intelligent transportation systems , smart grid , crowd safety , social cloud networks and smarter cities .    in mathematical physics ,",
    "most of models are analyzed in the asymptotic regime when the size of the system grows without bounds .",
    "as an example , the mckean - vlasov model  @xcite for interacting particles is analyzed when the number of particles tends to infinity .",
    "such an approach is referred to as mean field approach .",
    "the seminal works of sznitman  @xcite in the 1980s and the more recent work of kotolenez & kurtz @xcite show that the asymptotic system provides a good approximation of the finite system in the following sense : for any tolerance level @xmath0 there exists a population size @xmath1 such that for any @xmath2 the error gap between the solution of the infinite system and the system with size @xmath3 is at most @xmath4 moreover , the work in @xcite shows that the number @xmath1 is in order of @xmath5 for a class of smooth functions , where @xmath6 denotes the dimension of the space .",
    "thus , for @xmath7 this current theory does not give an approximation that is meaningful .    in queueing theory ,",
    "the number of customers is usually assumed to be large or follows a certain distribution with unbounded support ( e.g. , exponential , poisson etc ) and the buffer size ( queue ) can be infinite . however , many applications of interests such as airport boarding queues , supermarket queues , restaurant queue , iphone / ipad waiting queue involve a finite number of customers / travelers .",
    "approximation by a continuum of decision - makers may not reflect the reality .",
    "for example the number of clients in the supermarket queue can not exceed the size of available capacity of markets and there is a certain distance between the clients to be respected .",
    "in other words , human behaviors are not necessarily like standard fluid dynamics . in game theory , the rapidly emerging field of mean - field games  @xcite is addressing behavioral and algorithmic issues @xcite for mathematical models with continuum of players .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a survey on ( asymptotic ) mean field games .",
    "the classical works mentioned above provide rich mathematical foundations and equilibrium concepts in the asymptotic regime , but relatively little in the way of computational and representational insights that would allow for few number of players .",
    "most of the mean - field game models consider a continuum of players , which seems not realistic in terms of most applications of interests .",
    "below we give some limitations of the _ asymptotic _ mean - field approaches in engineering and in economics :    * in wireless networks , the number of interacting nodes at the same slot in the same range is finite and currently the capacity / bandwidth of the system is limited .",
    "therefore , a mean - field model for infinite capacity and infinite number of nodes is not plausible .",
    "the result of infinite system may not capture the real system with only few number of nodes . * in most of the current markets ,",
    "the number of traders is _ finite_. in that context it is well known that the bayesian - cournot game may not have an ex - post equilibrium whenever the number of traders is finite .",
    "however , the infinite game with continuum of traders has a pure ( static mean - field ) equilibrium .",
    "if our prediction is the `` mean - field equilibrium '' , in what sense the ( static ) mean - field ex - post equilibrium @xcite captures the finite system ?",
    "our primarily goal in this article is to provide a simple and easy to check condition such that mean - field theory can be used for finite - scale which we call _ non - asymptotic mean - field _ approach .",
    "we investigate the nonasymptotic mean - field under two basic conditions .",
    "the first condition is indistinguishability ( or interchangeability ) of the payoff functions .",
    "the indistinguishability property is easy to verify .",
    "the indistinguishability assumption is implicitly used in the classical ( static ) mean - field analysis including the seminal works of aumann 1964  @xcite , selten 1970  @xcite , schmeidler 1973 .",
    "this assumption is also implicitly used in the dynamic version of mean - field games by jovanovic & rosenthal 1988@xcite , benamou & brenier 2000  @xcite and lasry & lions 2007  @xcite .",
    "the second condition is the ( regularity ) smoothness of the payoff functions .",
    "the regularity property is relatively easy to check .",
    "based on these two conditions , we present a simple approximation framework for finite horizon mean - field systems .",
    "the framework can be easily extended to infinite horizon case .",
    "the non - asymptotic mean field approach is based on a simple observation that the many effects of different actions cancel out when the payoff is indistinguishable .",
    "nevertheless , it can lead to a significant simplification of mathematical mean - field models in finite regime .",
    "the approach presented here is non - asymptotic and is unrelated to the mean - field convergence that originates from law of large numbers ( and its generalization to de finetti - hewitt - savage functional mean - field convergence ) in large populations .",
    "the non - asymptotic mean field approach holds even when there are only few players in a game , or few nodes in a network .",
    "the idea presented here is inspired from the works in @xcite on the so - called averaging principle .",
    "these previous works are limited to static and one - shot games .",
    "here we use that idea not only for static games but also for dynamic mean - field games .",
    "one of the motivations of the asymptotic mean field game approach is that it may reduce the complexity analysis of large systems .",
    "the present work goes beyond that .",
    "we believe that if the complexity of the infinite system can be reduced easily then , the finite system can also be studied using a non - asymptotic mean - field approach .    in order to apply the mean - field approach to a system with arbitrary number of players",
    ", we shall exploit more the structure of objective function and the main assumption of the model which is the indistinguishability property , i.e. , the performance index is unchanged if one permutes the label of the players .",
    "this is what we will do in this work .",
    "the aggregative structure of the problem and the indistinguishability property of the players are used to derive an error bound for any number of players .",
    "interestingly , our result holds not only for large number of players but also for few number of players . for example , for @xmath8 players , there is no systematic way to apply the theory developed in the previous works  @xcite but the non - asymptotic mean - field result presented here could be applied . the non - asymptotic mean - field result does not impose additional assumptions on the payoff function .",
    "we show that the indistinguishability property provides an accurate error bound for any system size .",
    "we show that the total equilibrium payoff with heterogeneous parameters can be approximated by the symmetric payoff where the symmetry is the respect to the mean of those parameters .",
    "these parameters can be a real number , vector , matrix or a infinite functional .",
    "the proof of the approximation error is essentially based on a taylor expansion which cancels out the first order terms due to indistinguishability property .",
    "we provide various examples where non - asymptotic mean - field interaction is required and the indistinguishability property could be exploited more efficiently .",
    "we present of queueing system with only few servers where closed - form expression of the waiting time is not available and the use of the present framework gives appropriate bounds .",
    "as second main example focuses on dynamic auctions with asymmetric bidders that can be self - interested , malicious or spiteful . in models of first - price auctions , when bidders are ex ante heterogeneous , deriving explicit equilibrium bid functions is an open issue . due to the boundary - value problem nature of the equilibrium ,",
    "numerical methods remain challenging issue .",
    "recent theoretical research concerning asymmetric auctions have determined some qualitative properties these bid functions must satisfy when certain conditions are met . here",
    "we propose an accurate approximation based on non - asymptotic mean field game approach and examine the relative expected payoffs of bidders and the seller revenue ( which is indistinguishable ) to decide whether the approximate solutions are consistent with theory .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ staticscale ]",
    "we present a mean field system with arbitrary number of interacting entities and propose a nonasymptotic static mean field framework . in section [ secdynamicscale ]",
    "we extend our basic results in a dynamic setup . in section [ basicapplication ]",
    "we present applications of nonasymptotic mean - field approach to collaborative effort game , approximation of queueing delay performance and computation of error bound of equilibrium bids in dynamic auction with asymmetric bidders .",

    "currently a large proportion of internet users employ search engines to locate information  @xcite . for example , search engines are used to obtain an instantaneous selection of offers from various providers operating in the cyberspace .",
    "internet auctions , on the other hand , connect potential sellers and buyers from different locations in a virtual auction .",
    "buyers also often get multiple purchase opportunities over time .",
    "this is most obvious in the case of today s online auction markets : ebay has auctions for physical goods closing every second , while google s doubleclick and microsoft s advertising exchange trade online advertisements at a much faster rate .",
    "this creates the possibility for buyers to inter - temporally substitute , adjusting their current bids to account for the option value of waiting for future purchasing opportunities .    in sponsored search auctions , such as those run by google ( adwords ) or bing ( adcenter ) , a query to a search engine triggers an auction for positions on the page returned by the query .",
    "advertisers bid for positions or slots , and successful bids result in ads being displayed alongside results to the query .",
    "the slots are ordered , where higher slots are more valuable . under a dynamic auction mechanism for slots ,",
    "an agent places a single bid , bids are ranked by weight and ranked bids determine the slot allocation .",
    "if an advert displayed in a slot is clicked , then the advertiser pays the price to be in the current slot , a pay - per - click payment model .    in order to capture the practical observation , we model the problem as dynamic auction between buyers and sellers .",
    "we specially focus on the buyers side .",
    "since measurement are done in discrete time unit , we start with a discrete time model . the work in @xcite considered repeated second - price auctions under homogeneous valuation distributions and budget constraints .",
    "most auctions involve bidders that are heterogeneous ex ante .",
    "for example ad networks may not have homogeneous valuation distribution for the advertisers .",
    "therefore , here we consider asymmetric distribution as well .",
    "time space is @xmath110 where @xmath159 is the length of the horizon .",

    "<S> mean - field games have been studied under the assumption of very large number of players . for such large systems , </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea consists to approximate large games by a stylized game model with a continuum of players . </S>",
    "<S> the approach has been shown to be useful in some applications . however , the stylized game model with continuum of decision - makers is rarely observed in practice and the approximation proposed in the asymptotic regime is meaningless for networks with few entities . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a mean - field framework that is suitable not only for large systems but also for a small world with few number of entities . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of the proposed framework is illustrated through various examples including dynamic auction with asymmetric valuation distributions , and spiteful bidders .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : nonasymptotic , approximation , games with few decision - makers . </S>"
