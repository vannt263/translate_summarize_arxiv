    "winds blown by stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) are an important component of mass return into the interstellar medium and may account for a significant fraction of interstellar dust , including dust formation in the early universe ( sloan et al .",
    "2009 ) . therefore in addition to its obvious significance for the theory of stellar evolution ,",
    "the study of agb winds has important implications for the structure and evolution of galaxies ( girardi & marigo 2007 ; marston et al .",
    "2009 ) . in our own galaxy , its estimated 200,000 agb stars are a good tracer of dominant components , including the bulge ( whitelock & feast 2000 ; jackson , ivezi & knapp 2002 ) .",
    "agb stars also have a great potential as distance indicators ( rejkuba 2004 ) .    over the past few years",
    ", data of agb stars have improved significantly .",
    "the 2mass survey delivered an all - sky near - ir photometric catalog to @xmath0 , and spitzer obtained mid - ir ( irac and mips ) photometry for several thousand agb stars from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , meixner et al .",
    "in addition , the macho survey provided high - quality light curves for @xmath122,000 agb stars from the lmc ( fraser et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the northern sky variability survey provided light curves for another @xmath19,000 agb stars brighter than @xmath2 and with declination @xmath3 ( woniak et al .",
    "these new accurate and massive data sets are expected to rejuvenate studies of agb stars , leading to model - based interpretation of diverse measurements including photometry , outflow velocity , mass - loss rate , pulsations , etc .",
    "( e.g. , marigo et al . 2008 ) .",
    "agb stars are surrounded by an expanding envelope composed of gas and dust , that has a major impact on observed properties .",
    "the complete description of such a dusty wind should start with a full dynamic atmosphere model and incorporate the processes that initiate the outflow and set the value of .",
    "these processes are yet to be identified with certainty , the most promising are stellar pulsation ( e.g. bowen 1989 ; van loon et al .",
    "2008 ) and radiation pressure on the water molecules ( e.g. elitzur , brown & johnson 1989 )",
    ". proper description of these processes should be followed by grain formation and growth , and subsequent wind dynamics .",
    "two ambitious programs attempting to incorporate as many aspects of this formidable task as possible have been conducted over the last decade by groups at berlin ( see winters et al .",
    "2000 ; wachter et al .",
    "2008 ; and references therein ) and vienna ( see hfner 1999 ; dorfi et al .",
    "2001 ; hfner et al . 2003",
    "; nowotny et al . 2005 ; and references therein ) . while much has been accomplished , the complexity of this undertaking necessitates simplifications such as a pulsating boundary . in spite of continuous progress ,",
    "detailed understanding of atmospheric dynamics and grain formation is still far from complete ( e.g. , hfner & andersen 2007 ) .",
    "fortunately , the full problem splits naturally to two parts , as recognized long ago by goldreich & scoville ( 1976 ) .",
    "once radiation pressure on the dust exceeds all other forces , the rapid acceleration to supersonic velocities decouples the outflow from the earlier phases_the supersonic phase would be exactly the same in two different outflows if they had the same mass - loss rate and grain properties even if the grains were produced by entirely different processes . _",
    "furthermore , these stages are controlled by processes that are much less dependent on detailed micro - physics , and are reasonably well understood . and since most observations probe only the supersonic phase , models devoted exclusively to this stage should reproduce the observable results while avoiding the pitfalls and uncertainties of dust formation and the wind initiation .",
    "in elitzur & ivezi ( 2001 , hereafter paper i ) we present the self - similarity solution of the dusty wind steady state supersonic phase .",
    "the model assumes steady - state spherically symmetric mass loss with prompt dust formation and no subsequent change in dust properties ( i.e. , no grain growth and sputtering ) .",
    "the included dynamical effects are the radiation pressure force , dust drift through the gas , and the gravitational pull by the star .",
    "paper i contains the description of the model and its solution in full mathematical rigor .",
    "here we discuss observational implications of the model , and compare them to available data .",
    "the main questions that we ask are    * can the model explain the wind velocity profile , including the region of strong acceleration at small radii ?",
    "* does the implied density profile produce spectral energy distributions in agreement with observations ? * do dynamical quantities , such as the wind terminal velocity and mass - loss rate , and photometric quantities such as colors and bolometric flux , display correlations predicted by the model ? * how similar , or dissimilar , are dust properties inferred from observations of oxygen - rich and carbon - rich agb stars ?",
    "we first discuss dynamical quantities , and then focus on the spectral energy distribution . in ",
    "2 we describe the wind velocity profile .",
    "section 3 presents correlations among final velocity , mass loss rate  and luminosity @xmath4 . in ",
    "4 we discuss the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and its relationship with the wind dynamical properties . in  5 we discuss the allowed range of physical parameters of dusty winds .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in  6 .",
    "equations from paper i are referred to by their number preceded by i.",
    "the velocity profile for all winds , whether the dust is comprised of carbon or silicate grains , can be summarized with the simple analytic expression ( see  3 in paper i ) here @xmath5 is angular distance from the star in the plane of the sky and @xmath6 is a characteristic angular scale .",
    "the power @xmath7 introduces a weak dependence on , the overall radial optical depth at visual .",
    "the small - value @xmath8 reflects the effect of the drift , which dominates the dynamics in that regime . at large , reddening effects a switch to a more moderate profile with @xmath9 .",
    "we discuss the wind terminal velocity  in  3 below . here",
    "we concentrate on the shape of the radial profile @xmath10 .",
    "the profile is mainly controlled by the characteristic angular scale @xmath6 , corresponding to the dust condensation radius .",
    "it can be determined from the measured bolometric flux , @xmath11 , via here  is the dust condensation temperature and @xmath12 is a dimensionless function that sets the dust condensation radius as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the stellar radius and effective temperature .",
    "all our model calculations assume  = 700 k and a black - body star with @xmath15 = 2500 k. the function @xmath12 is determined from the radiative transfer solution ( see i.41 and i.42 ) and can be adequately approximated by the simple analytic expression the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are listed in table  [ tab : dust ] together with other relevant properties of the dust grains .",
    "in all the numerical calculations here we employ amorphous carbon grains with optical properties from hanner ( 1988 ) , and ( the `` warm '' version of ) silicate grains from ossenkopf , henning & mathis ( 1992 ) . we assume a single size @xmath18 = 0.1  to compute the grain absorption and scattering efficiencies ; the grain size does not enter the solution of the dusty wind problem in any other way . from their effect on the variation of angular scale @xmath6 with , the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 introduce the only dependence of the velocity profile on dust properties .",
    "however , in practice this effect is rather weak : @xmath6 varies by less than 10% for  between 0 and 20 .",
    ".standard parameters for dust grains with size @xmath18 = 0.1 :  is the efficiency factor for absorption at visual ;  is the planck average at the stellar temperature ( 2,500k ) of the efficiency coefficient for radiation pressure ( see paper i , equation 4 ) ;  and @xmath17 , defined in eq .",

    "[ eq : universal ] becomes it is remarkable that , even though the wind is driven by radiation pressure , its velocity is _ independent of luminosity _ for small  ( optically thin limit ; see also  4.2 in paper i ) .",
    "this surprising result was discovered observationally by young ( 1995 ) in a survey of 36 nearby mira variables with low mass - loss rates .",
    "young found a clear , strong correlation between outflow velocity and mass - loss rate , but independent of luminosity .",
    "his correlation can be parametrized as @xmath29 , in agreement with eq.[eq : young ] if the observational errors for the power - law index are at least 10% , which is plausible .",

    "we did not introduce any cuts since the sample is dominated by optically thin envelopes , as can be seen from figure [ fig : basico ] . on the other hand ,",

    "these strongly peaked distributions affirm the central role of dust drift at small mass loss rates and indicate a close similarity of dust properties within each sample .",
    "the velocity scale @xmath35 , 19  for c - rich and 13  for o - rich stars , is a fundamental property of dusty winds , derived directly from the data .",
    "adding assumptions regarding the grain properties enables determination of the dust geometric cross - section per gas particle from where @xmath36 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : sig22 ] shows the variation with grain size of the inferred values of   for amorphous carbon and silicate grains .",
    "remarkably , the two samples of different type stars produce values of   that agree to within 50% at all grain sizes . in spite of the large differences in atmospheric and grain properties between o- and c - rich stars , the fraction of material channelled into dust is such that the dust area per gas particle turns out to be roughly the same in both .",
    "the quantity closest to   that is directly determined in observation is the dust extinction per h column density .",
    "the galactic average yields @xmath37 @xmath38 ( e.g. , sparke & gallagher 2006 ) , which translates to   = 5 .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig : sig22 ] shows the variation with grain size of the value of   inferred from the measured values of @xmath35 for the c- and o - rich stars .",

    "another indicator of dust abundance is the dust - to - gas mass ratio ; it is widely used even though its determination invokes assumptions about molecular abundances that bring additional uncertainty .",
    "estimates of the galactic average of  range from  0.005 ( draine 2009 ) to 0.01 ( barbaro et al 2004 ) . recalling that   characterizes the base of the outflow where the gas and dust have the same velocity ( prior to the dust drift",

    "[ eq : s22 ] ) , the outflow dust - to - gas mass ratio is where @xmath39 is the density of the grain material ( 3.28 g@xmath40 for silicate dust , 2.2 g@xmath40 for carbon grains ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : sig22 ] shows the variation with grain size of the value of  for dusty winds , providing yet another display of two properties noted above : ( 1 ) in spite of the large differences in their formation properties , the mass fraction of carbon and silicate grains is roughly the same in both types of stars , and ( 2 ) the wind dust abundance is significantly below the galactic average .",
    "these results have significant consequences regarding the origin of interstellar dust . using either   or  as indicators ,",
    "the dust abundance in winds around evolved stars is substantially lower than the galactic averages irrespective of grain size or chemical composition .",
    "the mrn average for in dusty winds is more than a factor of 10 below the galactic average for silicate dust , a factor of 5 for carbon .",
    "since the winds fail to produce the observed ism values for both types of grains at all sizes , mixture averaging can not bring the results to the galactic values .",
    "the implication is that dusty winds _ can not _ be the source of all galactic dust : if all dust were formed by cycling interstellar gas through stars , with existing grains destroyed during star formation and reformed around evolved stars , than the galactic average could not exceed the dusty winds value .",
    "draine ( 2009 ) discusses additional grain destruction mechanisms in estimating the galactic dust budget , and concludes that they could not be offset by formation in stars ( see also zhukovska , gail & trieloff 2008 ) .",
    "our results show that even without considering any processes other than cycling through stars , _ most interstellar dust is not stardust and must have formed in the ism _ , in strong support of draine s conclusion .",
    "it should be noted that the analysis here provides a robust derivation of the dust abundance .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is determined directly from the data , and its conversion to   and  involves only minimal assumptions about the grain properties ; significantly , no assumptions are made about any molecular abundances .",
    "the presented results employed  = 700 k , and the inferred dust abundance scales as @xmath41 .",
    "varying  in its likely range , the dust abundance would increase at every @xmath18 by 36% for  = 600 k and decrease by 23% if  = 800 k ; such variations have little effect on our conclusions .",
    "in addition , there is no need to consider global balance of dust forming and destruction processes in the ism , which are very uncertain .",
    "our conclusion is derived from consideration of individual stars and therefore it is independent of , and supports , draine s arguments .     as a function of grain size .",

    "[ fig : sig22 ] ]      as  increases away from @xmath25 , the wind becomes optically thick and reddening degrades the efficiency of the radiation pressure force , thus the velocity again decreases .",
    "the wind velocity is no longer independent of luminosity . instead , from equations [ eq :",
    "universal ] and [ eq : tauv ] it follows that when @xmath32 , the final velocity is proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath30 is no longer constant , instead it decreases as @xmath45 from its value in the optically thin regime .",

    ". this test would be much stronger if the samples contained more stars with very large values of  ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) so that the transitions from optically thin to thick regimes were better defined .",
    "we note that the samples are dominated by optically thin envelopes , thus our above estimates of the mean @xmath35 are not appreciably biased by the few stars with moderate optical depths .    , with the @xmath35 value determined from the small  limit ( figure [ fig : aoxygen ] ) .",

    ", the proper form of momentum conservation is @xmath49 , where  is the flux - averaged optical depth . since  can exceed unity for plausible values of  ( see paper i , eq .",
    "57 and figure 6 ) , momentum conservation does not impose a meaningful constraint on dusty winds .",
    "instead , the constraints come from force considerations  the radiative outward force must exceed everywhere the gravitational pull of the star with mass @xmath50 .",
    "this condition breaks down at the two ends of the mass - loss - rate range , where the outward force is reduced for two different reasons : at very low  the gas  dust momentum coupling weakens thus reducing the force on the gas , and at very high  the coupling to the radiative force diminishes because of the enhanced reddening that follows increased obscuration . in paper",
    "i ( see sec .  5 , in particular figure 7 ) we derive the resulting phase - space boundaries with the aid of the appropriate scaling variables . here",
    "we reproduce the results in terms of the system physical parameters .",

    "this liftoff condition sets a lower bound on , proportional to @xmath51 ( paper i , eq .",
    "69 ) ; below this minimal @xmath52 the grains are ejected without dragging the gas with them because the density is too low for efficient gas  dust coupling . as a condition on the wind initiation ,",
    "this bound is the most uncertain part of our solution .",
    "the result @xmath53 is reasonably secure ( a similar relation was noted by habing et al 1994 ) , but the proportionality constant can be determined accurately only from a more complete formulation that handles properly grain growth and the wind launching mechanism .    the bound shown in figure [ fig : thickbound ] reflects the weakening of radiative coupling in optically thick winds because of the radiation reddening . for any eddington ratio ( the horizontal axis ) , the figure shows the upper limit on the wind optical depth  ( @xmath54 ; see eq.[eq : tauv ] ) , determined from the full numerical solution of the self - similar problem ; the vertical axis units were chosen to vary linearly with .",
    "although some stars have @xmath55 , none violate the upper bound set by proper solution of the dusty wind problem .    ]     ]",
    "given the grain properties , the dusty wind problem requires three independent input parameters , which can be selected as the initial velocity , the eddington ratio and the overall optical depth ( paper i ) .",
    "however , the dependence on the first two is limited to the immediate vicinity of the boundary of the phase - space for physical solutions ; away from that boundary , dusty winds are described by a set of similarity functions of the single independent variable . figures [ fig : thinbound ] and [ fig : thickbound ] show that most stars are located well inside the allowed region of phase space and thus should be well described by  alone .",
    "therefore , we should be able to characterize every property of the wind ir emission ( sed , colors , etc . ) with  only .",
    "we employed the code dusty ( ivezi ' c , nenkova & elitzur 1999 ) to compute the sed of each of the three oxygen - rich stars whose velocity profiles , as well as the approximate analytic solution of eq .",

    "if one wished to compare  for two populations of stars , say from the galaxy and the lmc , a robust method is to compare the @xmath30 distributions for samples verified to be optically thin using spectral energy distribution .    despite the successful confrontation of our model with observations , reality is more complex .",
    "the model assumes steady state and spherical geometry , but there is evidence that in some stars mass - loss rate is not steady ( see , e.g. , marengo , ivezi & knapp 2001 , and references therein ) and that some contain an additional bipolar component ( see , e.g. , vinkovi et al 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , the physical and chemical details at the base of the acceleration region are not included in our model .",
    "it would be prudent to compare predictions for the velocity spatial profile and relationships among dynamical and spectral quantities produced by more elaborate models , e.g. , fleischer , winters & sedlmayr 1999 , hfner 1999 and dorfi et al 2001 .",
    "such a comparison would help identify which features in these complex models are simply direct consequences of energy and momentum conservation , and which are unique to detailed modeling of various physical and chemical effects .",

    "here we summarize the main measuring methods for most relevant observables , with emphasis on their accuracy and scaling with distance .",
    "observational methods for determining mass - loss rate and outflow velocity were analyzed and compared by van der veen & rugers ( 1989 , hereafter vdvr ) .",
    "more detailed discussions are presented by habing ( 1996 ) , olofsson ( 1996 , 1997 ) and wallerstein & knapp ( 1998 ) .",
    "there are three widely employed methods :    * the strength and shape of thermal co line profiles contain information about the outflow velocity and the total amount of co in the circumstellar shell .",
    "the shape and width of the line profile constrains the outflow velocity in an almost model - independent way . with the current observational capabilities and moderate signal - to - noise ratios ,",
    "the outflow velocity can be constrained to better than 10% .",
    "most of the co emission comes from the outer parts of the envelope , and thus the measured velocity usually corresponds to the final outflow velocity .",
    "+ the relationship between the implied co mass and the directly observed quantities is a complex model - dependent function .",
    "the expressions most often used in data analysis were derived by knapp & morris ( 1985 ) .",
    "the transformation from the co mass to gas mass - loss rate requires further assumptions about the outflow , its geometry , and the co - to - gas ratio . assuming a steady - state outflow and spherical geometry , vdvr derive expressions that can be used to estimate gas mass - loss rate with an uncertainty of about a factor 2 - 5 .",
    "more accurate estimates can be obtained by detailed modeling of individual sources , but probably not significantly better than a factor of 2 .",
    "we note that the mass - loss rate estimate scales with @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the source distance . *",
    "the oh(1612mhz ) maser line profile contains information about the outflow velocity and the amount of oh molecules .",
    "the line profile usually has two well - defined peaks whose velocity separation typically constrains the outflow velocity to better than 10% .",
    "this estimate is less model - dependent than the estimate based on the co line profile , but unfortunately can only be used for oxygen - rich ( o ) stars .",
    "+ baud & habing ( 1983 ) proposed a simple model - dependent relation that can be used to estimate the mass - loss rate from the peak flux of oh emission .",
    "as pointed out by vdvr , the uncertainty of this estimate can be as large as a factor of 5 due to strong temporal variations in the oh emission strength .",
    "intrinsic accuracy of this method is probably not much better than a factor of 2 due to a number of assumptions made , and due to uncertain values of the oh - to - gas ratio .",
    "we note that the mass - loss rate estimate proposed by baud & habing scales with @xmath64 . *",
    "the third widely employed method for estimating mass - loss rate is based on infrared observations of dust emission .",
    "the proposed expressions ( herman _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , jura 1987 ) relate the observed emission to the optical depth , which in turn is assumed to encode information about the gas mass - loss rate and outflow velocity . similarly to the above two methods that rely on the assumptions about the co - to - gas and oh - to - gas ratios , the infrared - based mass - loss rate estimate is greatly affected by uncertain dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "depending on numerous additional assumptions employed by various authors , the distance dependence of the infrared mass - loss rate estimates varies from proportional to @xmath63 , to no dependence at all . + various observables that relate infrared emission to optical depth have been also been widely utilized . both herman _ et al . _ and jura assume that the 60  dust emission is optically thin , leading to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the iras flux at 60  and @xmath67 is the bolometric flux .",
    "van der veen and rugers ( vdvr ) relate the optical depth to the @xmath68 flux ratio , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the iras fluxes at 12 and 25 .",
    "+ one of the most widely used prescriptions for determining mass - loss rate from ir observations was proposed by jura ( 1987 ) .",
    "he assumed that the dust mass - loss rate is proportional to dust outflow velocity and dust optical depth , and that dust outflow velocity is proportional to gas outflow velocity .",
    "dust optical depth is assumed to be linearly proportional to the far - ir flux ( iras 60  bandpass ) because both the dust optical depth and the stellar contribution to the overall flux are very small at such long wavelengths . given the importance of dust drift in optically thin regime discussed in ",
    "[ sec : asection ] , the success of jura s formula is very surprising : for small optical depths the ratio of dust and gas velocities is much larger than unity , which should lead to significant underestimate of mass - loss rate . + it turns out that there are two effects that offset each other , and the jura s expression for  coincidentally produces correct values over a large dynamic range of mass - loss rate .",
    "in addition to neglected dust drift , the assumption about far - ir flux being dominated by dust emission also breaks down in optically thin regime .",
    "these effects are quantitatively illustrated in figure  [ fig : jura ] : at small mass - loss rates the increase of the ratio of dust and gas velocities is well matched by the decrease of the dust emission contribution to the 60  flux . as a result ,",
    "jura s mass - loss rate estimate never deviates by more than a factor of 2 from the median mass - loss rate ratio shown by the dotted line in figure  [ fig : jura ] ( this median ratio is @xmath12.5 and represents an overall systematic offset of two mass - loss rate scales ) .",
    "hence , the success of jura s formula , which does not incorporate dust drift , is _ not _ an argument against our model which includes dust drift .",
    "+ 2 over a large range of mass - loss rate .",
    "the horizontal lines are added to guide the eye and represent the median  ratio in the range 10@xmath71 to 10@xmath72  ( dotted line ) and 10@xmath73 to 10@xmath72  ( thin solid line ) .",
    "[ fig : jura ] ]        wavelengths , thus making the infrared emission the most important part of the sed for model testing .",
    "the largest catalog of infrared observations is compiled by gezari _",
    "individual fluxes may often be more accurate than 10% , but due to the inhomogeneous nature of the catalog , the mean overall accuracy is probably lower .",
    "the wavelength coverage greatly varies among the sources and often is based only on the iras catalog .",
    "recent large scale sensitive digital surveys ( e.g. infrared 2mass , skrutskie _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; optical sdss , york _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) are bound to significantly improve the availability of accurate multi - wavelength photometry .    given the photometric data accurate to within 10% , the bolometric flux could be determined with the same accuracy , at least in principle . in practice , however , the wavelength coverage can be sparse and this shortcoming can lead to severe errors , unless the shape of sed is known a priori .",
    "another difficulty is the variability of agb stars which can also contribute significantly to bolometric flux errors .",
    "given all these uncertainties , the bolometric flux can be determined to better than 20 - 30% only for a small number ( @xmath74 ) of well observed stars .",
    "several methods are employed to estimate distances to agb stars .",
    "the simplest one assumes that all agb stars have luminosity of 10@xmath75 , and determines distance using bolometric flux .",
    "apart from a bias in this estimate ( the median agb luminosity is at least a factor of 2 smaller , see e.g. habing _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 , and knauer , ivezi & knapp 2001 ) , its intrinsic accuracy can not be better than about 20 - 30% due to the finite width of the agb luminosity function ( jackson , ivezi & knapp 2002 ) .",
    "other methods that have been frequently used to estimate distance include period - luminosity relations ( e.g. , whitelock , marang & feast 2000 ) , assumption that the absolute k - band magnitude is the same for all stars , and kinematic estimates based on radial systemic velocities .",
    "the distance errors associated with these methods are hard to characterize and sometimes do not even have a gaussian distribution ( e.g. kinematic distances ) ; they may be more accurate than a factor of two , but probably not better than 20 - 30% .",
    "the distance estimates to nearby agb stars have been recently greatly improved with the data obtained by the hipparcos satellite .",
    "the accuracy of hipparcos distances varies from a star to star , but , nevertheless , there are now hundreds of agb stars with distance estimates better than 10% .",
    "the bolometric luminosity can be determined using the bolometric flux and distance estimates .",
    "assuming hipparcos distances and stars with good photometric coverage , the luminosity can determined to within 10 - 20% . in more typical cases ,",
    "its uncertainty is closer to 50% ( e.g. knauer , ivezi & knapp 2001 ) , and without a hipparcos parallax it can be as large as a factor of 2 ( jackson , ivezi & knapp 2002 ) ."
