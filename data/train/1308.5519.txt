    "<S> however , there is another , previously unknown , instability of the ( f , af ) phase which is of crucial interest here . </S>",
    "<S> this instability can be traced down to the fact that in the ( f , af ) phase magnons tend to bind to kinks in the orbital order ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> hence , for @xmath40 a novel phase is expected with a finite density of composite kink - dimer particles `` floating '' in the ferromagnetic background  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an infinitesimal density of moving kinks and antikinks immediately suppresses the orbital order , so the orbital af order parameter experiences a jump at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the ( f , af ) product wave function remains an exact eigenstate all the way up to @xmath41 , and @xmath42 remains smaller than the ising transition value @xmath43 in a finite range of @xmath25 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : allferri](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that such a correlation persists at all magnetization values , and that the number of peaks in the domain wall density is always equal to the number of magnons in the ground state .    moreover , the energy of the lowest excitation in the same @xmath62 sector as the ground state ( the particle - hole gap ) scales as @xmath63 with the system size @xmath53 , while that in the sector corresponding to adding a magnon scales as @xmath64 , as shown in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> one can straightforwardly check that this follows from the fact that the wave function of the bound state is very close to a singlet bond across the orbital domain wall , so that the operator @xmath71 nearly anihilates the ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> _ boundary transitions. _ in addition to the existence of the fsol phase , the spin - orbital model with @xmath22 is characterized by the appearance of peculiar boundary phase transitions within the ( ih , p ) phase ( curves b1 and b2 in fig .  </S>",
