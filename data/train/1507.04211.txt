    "the 4@xmath5-metals , and their alloys and intermetallic compounds exhibit rich pressure - temperature - composition phase diagrams . often , transitions between different phases are accompanied by a dramatic change in the material properties , including abrupt volume variation , and in particular the extent to which the @xmath5 electron localization changes under such phase transitions is of great scientific interest .",
    "the transition between localized and itinerant behaviour is at the forefront of physics of strongly correlated systems .",
    "such a transition occurs in the 5@xmath5 electron shell of the pure actinide metals - the 5@xmath5 electrons behave in a localized fashion in the heavy actinides but in a more delocalized manner in the light actinides - centering near pu and am .",
    "a quantitative and conclusive understanding of this phenomenon is still missing.@xcite in the lanthanide series , where the 4@xmath5 orbitals are spatially less extended than the 5@xmath5 orbitals in the actinides , localized - itinerant transitions occur at the beginning ( around ce ) , in the middle ( sm , eu ) and at the end ( yb ) . application of high pressure leads to a 4@xmath5 delocalization and , in some cases , to structural phase transformations accompanied by a volume discontinuity .",
    "the most famous example is cerium , which exhibits the isostructural @xmath6 volume - collapse phase transition upon either cooling or application of external pressure .",

    "the volume fraction of low - pressure phase is 37@xmath581% , and the high - pressure phase occupies 63@xmath581% of the sample volume .",
    "however , we note that a complete fullprof refinement of the high - pressure diffraction patterns is hardly possible due to large number of fitting parameters ( for 3@xmath77 structure there are three nonequivalent ce ions and three nonequivalent ni ions located at ( 4c ) @xmath81 positions ) .",

    "the latter structure is typical for the @xmath86ni compounds where @xmath86 is the rare - earth metal from the second half of the lanthanide series , while light lanthanides , including cerium , form the crystal lattice of the crb type.@xcite therefore , the @xmath0 symmetry is more favorable for the small rare earth ionic volume than @xmath7 .",
    "both the feb and crb type structures contain a common structural unit , the trigonal prism , which is stacked differently to form either structure.@xcite if the @xmath53 value of the @xmath87 sites in the @xmath0 structure goes to zero , one obtains the higher - symmetry @xmath7 structure.@xcite thus , the pressure - induced conversion from a crb to a feb type structure is not surprising . furthermore , hohnke and parth@xcite established the set of transformation equations between the crystal lattice parameters of these two structures : @xmath88    for this `` ideal '' case the volumes of feb and crb structures are equal .",
    "the room temperature lattice parameters of the crb structure at @xmath57  gpa ( two phases coexist at this pressure ) are @xmath89   , @xmath90   , @xmath91  (fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . for these parameters ,",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) predict the feb structure to have @xmath92   , @xmath93   , @xmath94   , so that deviations from the experimental values at @xmath95  k and @xmath57  gpa are -4% , -2% , and + 7% , respectively . the fact that the experimental feb crystal lattice parameters are found to be close to the expected `` ideal '' values is an additional argument in favor of @xmath0 symmetry of room temperature ceni phase with pressure range between 1 and 5  gpa .",
    "the deviation of the experimental unit cell parameters from the `` ideal '' values is the result of a @xmath131.3% volume jump due to the transition .",

    "the volume jump at the transition ( @xmath61  k , @xmath68  gpa ) is @xmath137.9% , that is , as expected , much bigger than at room temperature .    ]    now we can establish an approximate @xmath1 phase diagram of ceni ( fig .",

    "at @xmath61  k and @xmath68  gpa the ceni sample is found to be inside the transition region ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) , however not with the pure feb @xmath0 structure but its 3@xmath77 modification .",
    "we did not observe the pure feb structure at 100  k. thus , we can not say whether or not there is a pressure window for the feb structure between the transition line established in ref .   and confirmed in ref .   by magnetic measurements , and the transition to the 3@xmath77 at around 1  gpa ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we believe that the feb structure _ may _ appear here and then transforms , almost immediately , under increase in pressure into the observed 3@xmath77 structure .",
    "such a behavior can not be excluded since one of these structures ( crb and feb ) can transform to the other directly or via a sequence of polymorphous transformations.@xcite in fact , a very similar picture is observed at 300  k. the crb @xmath105 feb conversion does occur at 300  k , and then a second structure modification takes place at pressure above 4.9  gpa .",

    "therefore , it seems quite reasonable to assume that at @xmath111  gpa and at room temperature the ceni sample consists of a mixture of hp feb phase and @xmath109 structures , which can be called `` @xmath0-based mixed phase structure '' .",

    "we can not exclude , however , a more complicated ceni structure at pressures above , say , 5  gpa .",
    "the appearance of low scattering angle bragg reflections in the ceni xrd pattern at room temperature can also be considered to be the result of a coexistence of mixed feb - crb stacking variants similar to that found in @xmath114ni systems ( @xmath115  gd and @xmath116  tb).@xcite however , the presence of the feb - crb mixture at high pressures does not look plausible since it requires reappearance of crb phase . the question remains open whether such a coexistence of phases is of intrinsic origin or is a consequence of non - hydrostatic compression conditions and/or stress between grains of the powder samples .",

    "the pressure - induced volume - collapse structural transition indicates essential changes of the ceni electronic states . what can be deduced about these changes from the structural data obtained in the present study ?",
    "let us consider the variations of interatomic distances in ceni due to the structural transition from the ambient pressure crb - type of structure to feb - type of structure ( @xmath47  gpa ) at room temperature .",
    "ce ions in the @xmath7 structure have seven ni ions in the first coordination sphere at nearly equal distances r@xmath128(lp ) = 2.938     ( 2 ions ) , r@xmath16(lp ) = 2.948     ( 4 ions ) , and r@xmath129(lp ) = 3.011     ( 1 ion ) .",
    "the next coordination sphere consists of eight ce ions at r@xmath130(lp ) = 3.601     ( 2 ions ) , r@xmath131(lp ) = 3.752     ( 4 ions ) , and r@xmath20(lp ) = 3.771     ( 2 ions ) . in the @xmath0 structure ,",
    "ce ions are surrounded by six nearest neighboring ni ions at r@xmath128(hp ) = 2.357     ( 1 ion ) , r@xmath16(hp ) = 2.761     ( 1 ion ) , r@xmath129(hp ) = 2.794     ( 2 ions ) , and r@xmath130(hp ) = 2.980     ( 2 ions ) .",
    "the second coordination sphere of the @xmath0 structure , as well as @xmath7 structure , contains eight ce ions at r@xmath131(hp ) = 3.525  (2 ions ) , r@xmath20(hp ) = 3.611     ( 2 ions ) , r@xmath132(hp ) = 3.773     ( 4 ions ) .",
    "thus , ce - ni interatomic distances shrink essentially due to @xmath4 transition . ce - ce interatomic distances decrease also , but their variation is less pronounced .",
    "the decrease of the ce - ni distances suggests an enhanced ce 4@xmath133 ni 3@xmath19 hybridization in the high pressure ceni phase as compared to the ambient pressure @xmath7 structure . as a result",
    ", one can expect an increase of the characteristic magnetic fluctuation energy @xmath134 , and a correlated decrease of the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath135 and the low temperature value of the pauli - like magnetic susceptibility ( both these values are generally inversely proportional to @xmath134 , which plays a role of an effective band width ) . obviously , these expectations agree with the experimental results.@xcite in fact , at an applied pressure of about 0.5  gpa both the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath135 ( see fig .  3 in ref .  [ ] ) and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath136(@xmath137  k ) ( red curve in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "[ ] ) decrease by the same factor of about 1.4 .",
    "note , that the smoothing of the peak structure of ni 3@xmath19 dos in the vicinity of @xmath121 ( fig .",
    "[ fig9](c ) ) may also be interpreted as a result of an enhanced 4@xmath133 3@xmath19 hybridization due to the structural transition .",
    "however , to achieve more direct and complete understanding of the evolution of the 4@xmath5 electronic states across the volume - collapse transition ( including the variation of @xmath134 and the 4@xmath5 occupation number as a function of pressure ) inelastic neutron scattering experiments are required .",
    "by means of x - ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements we have shown that pressure induces in ceni structural phase transitions from a low - pressure crb - type of structure ( @xmath7 space group ) to high - pressure phases belonging to the @xmath0 space group .",
    "the experimental results allow us to draw an approximate @xmath1 phase diagram of ceni according to which ceni undergoes two successive phase transitions within the @xmath1 domain @xmath2  gpa , @xmath138  k. the first transition converts the lp structure into the feb ( @xmath0 ) structure ( which was not , however , observed experimentally at @xmath61  k ) , while the second transition separates the feb structure ( hp phase ) and @xmath0-based mixed phase hp@xmath117 state .",
    "dft calculations predict that at ambient pressure the total energies of the @xmath7 and @xmath0 crystal structures are finely balanced , the latter energy being by 0.05  ev per unit cell higher than the former one . in terms of a dft approach the pressure - induced structural phase transition in ceni",
    "can be understood as a result of the higher compressibility of lp phase as compared to the hp phase : the lp total energy rises rapidly with pressure leading to a phase transition at the estimated pressure of 0.94  gpa .",
