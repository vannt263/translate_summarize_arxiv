    "considerable evidence suggests that the energetic processes in active galaxies and quasars are due to the accretion of matter onto massive bhs .",
    "lynden - bell ( 1969 ) already suggested that bhs may also be present in quiescent galaxies , such as the milky way , m31 and m32 .",
    "this spurred efforts to find bhs in nearby galaxies through kinematical studies , which have since increased steadily in sophistication , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "there are now convincing bh detections for at least a dozen galaxies , and new detections are reported at an ever increasing rate .",
    "the techniques for detecting bhs in individual galaxies have been reviewed by , e.g. , kormendy & richstone ( 1995 , hereafter kr95 ) , ford ( 1998 ) and richstone ( 1998 ) . here",
    "i address the more general question : _ do all galaxies have bhs?_=-2",
    "integration of quasar number counts yields the comoving energy density in quasar light .",
    "assuming that this energy is produced by accretion onto massive black holes , one obtains the total mass per cubic mpc that is collected in black holes ( sotan 1982 ) .",
    "division by the observed luminosity density of galaxies ( loveday 1992 ) yields an estimate of the average black hole mass per unit luminosity : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the accretion efficiency ( chokshi & turner 1992 ) .",
    "[ throughout this paper , @xmath6 , mass - to - light ratios are in solar units , and luminosities are in the b - band . ]    to address the bh mass _ distribution _ , one must model not only the total energy budget of the quasar population , but also its evolution . tremaine ( 1996 ; also faber 1997 , hereafter f97 ) presented a simple argument based on the typical quasar lifetime to show that a model in which every spheroid ( bulge or elliptical ) has a bh is consistent with the inferred @xmath7 .",
    "haehnelt & rees ( 1993 , hereafter hr93 ) presented a more detailed model ( in which bh formation is linked to hierarchical structure formation ) to fit the distribution of quasars as function of magnitude and redshift . their predicted bh mass distribution at the current time ( their fig .",
    "8) is consistent with a fraction @xmath8 of all galaxies having a bh.=-2    the uncertainties in these estimates are considerable .",
    "the only conclusion that can be drawn with some confidence is that a fraction @xmath91 of all galaxies is likely to contain bhs with @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "the product of these quantities , @xmath12 , is better constrained than either quantity independently , but is still rather uncertain ( if only due to the unknown  @xmath5).=-2    = 4.65truecm    = 4.65truecm    = 4.65truecm    -0.2truecm    -0.5truecm",
    "hr93 predict a direct connection between @xmath0 and the galaxy formation redshift @xmath13 ( galaxies that form later have smaller bhs ) , but not between @xmath14 and galaxy luminosity .",
    "spirals form later than ellipticals , and are therefore predicted to have smaller bhs .",
    "observations appear to confirm this ; e.g. , the ( active ) galaxies m87 and ngc 1068 have similar luminosities , but @xmath0 is @xmath15 times larger in m87 ( cf",
    ".  figure  1a below ) .",
    "observations do not rule out a correlation between @xmath0 and the _ spheroid _ luminosity of the host ( kr95 ) .",
    "this may indicate that @xmath0 and @xmath1 depend similarly on a common underlying parameter ( e.g. , @xmath13 , as in the models of hr93 ) , or alternatively , that there is a physical link between bhs and spheroids .",
    "figure  1a shows @xmath0 versus @xmath1 for all currently available bh mass determinations inferred from : ( @xmath16 )  radio observations of water masers ; ( @xmath17 )  ionized gas kinematics of nuclear disks ; ( @xmath18 )  time variability of broad double - peaked balmer lines ; and ( @xmath19 )  stellar kinematical studies that included anisotropic modeling ( studies with only isotropic models are discussed in  6 ) .",
    "there is indeed a correlation , but the scatter is large ( @xmath20 dex at fixed @xmath1 ) and selection bias may be important .",
    "the dashed line shows the @xmath0 for which the bh sphere of influence , @xmath21 , extends @xmath22 at a distance @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is determined by @xmath1 through the faber - jackson relation ) .",
    "bhs below this line can be detected only in galaxies closer than @xmath25 , and in galaxies in which kinematical tracers can be observed at resolutions @xmath26 ( e.g. , water masers ) .",
    "the solid line shows the predictions of one possible model that is consistent with the @xmath27 from quasar number counts .",
    "this ` reference model ' assumes that every spheroid has a bh with @xmath28 .",
    "approximately 30% of the light from galaxies is due to spheroids ( schechter & dressler 1987 ) .",
    "so for an assumed accretion efficiency @xmath29 this yields @xmath30 , which reproduces the trend in the data .",
    "hst observations of early - type galaxies have revealed central surface brightness cusps that fall in two categories ( f97 ) , ` power - laws ' ( showing no clear break ) and ` cores ' ( showing a clear break ) .",
    "cusps can be explained as a consequence of the influence of a bh on surrounding stars ( young 1980 , hereafter y80 ) .",
    "properties of cusps around bhs depend on @xmath0 , initial conditions ( quinlan 1995 , hereafter q95 ) and two - body relaxation ( bahcall & wolf 1976 ) .",
    "cusps may also be due to processes unrelated to bhs ( kr95 ) , and they can also be destroyed ( quinlan & hernquist 1997 ) . observed cusps therefore do not uniquely constrain the bh masses in galaxies .    nonetheless , simple models of adiabatic bh growth for observed photometry of m87 ( young 1978 ; lauer 1992 ; crane 1993 ) and several other galaxies imply bh masses that agree well with kinematic determinations .",
    "i have therefore started a study of adiabatic bh growth models for a large sample of galaxies with published hst photometry .",
    "these models may be particularly relevant for core galaxies , for which the observed break in the brightness profile may be associated with an originally homogeneous core .",
    "i have used the software of q95 to fit the photometric models of y80 to all core galaxies in the sample of f97 with @xmath31 ( van der marel 1998 , in preparation ) .",
    "the models fit well in the central few arcsec ( rms residual @xmath32 mag / arcsec@xmath33 ) , and the photometrically inferred @xmath0 appear meaningful : the kinematically determined @xmath0 for m87 and ngc 3379 ( see figure  1a ) are reproduced to within @xmath34 and @xmath35 dex , respectively.=-2    figure  1b shows the results for the whole sample .",
    "the @xmath0 are remarkably consistent with the kinematical detections in figure  1a , and show a similar trend with @xmath1 .",
    "so despite their simplicity , it may well be that the y80 models capture the essence of surface brightness cusps in core galaxies .",
    "the prevalence of these cusps would then imply that most or all core galaxies have bhs , with @xmath36 as suggested by figure  1b .",
    "stellar motions often provide the only kinematical tool to study bh masses in quiescent galaxies , but the well - known degeneracy between @xmath0 and velocity dispersion anisotropy ( binney & mamon 1982 ) is still a major complication .",
    "this degeneracy can be resolved when high resolution hst data are available ( e.g. , van der marel 1997 ; gebhardt 1998 ) , but such data are not yet available for many galaxies .",
    "lower resolution ground - based data are plentiful , but more ambiguous to interpret .",
    "i use the case of ngc 1600 , an e3 core galaxy with no significant rotation , to illustrate this.=-2    ground - based kinematical data with @xmath37 resolution ( jedrzejewski & schechter 1989 ) show a mildly peaked velocity dispersion profile , and hst photometry shows a shallow ( f97 ) , marginally significant ( byun 1996 ; gebhardt 1996 ) , surface brightness cusp .",
    "i construct spherical dynamical models ( adequate for the present purpose ) following the approach of van der marel ( 1994 , hereafter vdm94 ) .",
    "i solve the jeans equation for a given velocity anisotropy profile profile , @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 ) , project and convolve the results , and compare with the data in a @xmath40 sense .",
    "the normalization of the dispersion profile is determined by the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath41 , and its shape is determined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "-0.5truecm = 12.5truecm -0.2truecm    -0.5truecm    figure  2 shows the fitted @xmath40 , @xmath0 and @xmath41 in the @xmath44 parameter space , for models with constant @xmath42 .",
    "the valley in the @xmath40 contours shows that a one - parameter family of @xmath44 combinations fits the data .",
    "an isotropic model requires a very massive bh , @xmath45 , but only modest anisotropy , @xmath46 , is required to fit the data without a bh .",
    "models that are radially anisotropic at all radii may not correspond to a positive phase - space distribution function ( df ) ( vdm94 ) , or may not be stable ( stiavelli 1993 ) , so i also constructed models in which the core is isotropic , and in which there is a smooth transition at the break radius of the surface brightness profile ( @xmath47 ) to a value @xmath48 characteristic of the main body .",
    "models with @xmath49 are still all acceptable at the 1@xmath24 level .",
    "the best fit with no bh has @xmath50 , and the best fit with @xmath51 , as suggested by adiabatic bh growth ( figure  1b ) , has @xmath52 .",
    "so in the absence of independent constraints on the velocity dispersion anisotropy , the data do not significantly constrain @xmath0 .",
    "our understanding of the velocity anisotropy in galaxies is only rudimentary .",
    "ellipticals and bulges with power - law brightness profiles have low to intermediate luminosity ( f97 ) , and are flattened by rotation .",
    "the tensor virial theorem indicates that they may be isotropic . any anisotropic model with the same average",
    "@xmath53 is also viable , but both m32 ( van der marel 1998 ) and the galactic bulge ( evans & de zeeuw 1994 ) have indeed been shown to be nearly isotropic .",
    "by contrast , core galaxies like ngc 1600 have intermediate to high luminosity , and little rotation ( f97 ) .",
    "detailed studies of three individual galaxies ( merritt & oh 1997 ; rix 1997 ; gerhard 1998 ) are consistent with mild radial anisotropy , @xmath54@xmath55 , with a possible transition to isotropy at small radii .",
    "such a velocity distribution can be produced by dissipationless collapse ( van albada 1982 ) .",
    "mild radial anisotropy is also consistent with studies of the ratio of major to minor axis kinematics ( van der marel 1991 ) and line - of - sight velocity profile shapes ( bender 1994 ) in a larger sample of core galaxies , and is also seen in the galactic halo in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath56 ; beers & sommer - larsen 1995 ) .",
    "so it appears that power - law galaxies may be approximately isotropic and that core galaxy may be mildly radially anisotropic , but neither result is firmly established.=-2",
    "magorrian ( 1998 , hereafter mg98 ) studied 36 ( mostly ) elliptical galaxies for which hst photometry and ground - based stellar kinematics have been published .",
    "each galaxy was modeled with the jeans equations , assuming an @xmath57 df ( the axisymmetric generalization of a spherical isotropic model ) .",
    "figure  1c shows the bh masses that best fit the observed kinematics .",
    "bhs are required in nearly all galaxies , with @xmath58 ( long - dashed line ) , consistent with quasar number counts if the accretion efficiency @xmath59 .",
    "this is the first dynamical study that addresses a large sample in a homogeneous way while including hst photometry .",
    "it establishes the important fact that the presence of a bh in every spheroid is consistent with kinematical data , and that the required bh masses are consistent with quasar counts for a reasonable value of @xmath5 .",
    "nonetheless , the mg98 results are not unique . of the 29 galaxies that require a bh under the @xmath57 hypothesis , 19 are core galaxies with similar data as for ngc 1600 .",
    "mg98 find @xmath60 for ngc 1600 , but the results in  5 showed that all @xmath0 smaller than this are equally acceptable .",
    "so the mg98 models may have overestimated the masses and/or prevalence of bhs .",
    "this would not violate the constraints from quasar counts : if one assumes a higher @xmath61 , one may decrease all @xmath0 by a factor @xmath62 , or remove the bhs in 78% of the galaxies .",
    "two core galaxies in the sample have @xmath0 determinations from independent sources .",
    "neither is well fit by an @xmath57 model . for m87 , mg98 infer the same @xmath0 as inferred from hst gas kinematics , but only if the data outside @xmath63 are ignored . for ngc 3379 , mg98",
    "infer an @xmath0 that exceeds the more accurate determination of gebhardt ( 1998 ) by a factor  7 .",
    "independent of whether one views these comparisons as reasonable or poor agreement , it leaves open the question whether @xmath57 models return the correct result for galaxies that may not have a ( significant ) bh .",
    "one may wonder whether the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 inferred by mg98 can be explained if the @xmath0 values were partly spurious .",
    "this is in fact the case . for galaxies that are radially anisotropic",
    ", isotropic models will fit the observed dispersion gradients by invoking bhs for which @xmath64 is similar to the observational resolution .",
    "this predicts a correlation of @xmath0 with distance of the form @xmath65 , which is not inconsistent with the mg98 results .",
    "the more distant galaxies in the sample are the most luminous .",
    "so this predicts not only the correlation of @xmath0 with @xmath1 , but also that this correlation should be weaker for the galaxies in virgo ( which are all at the same distance ) , as seen in figure  1c .",
    "actual measurements of the velocity anisotropy are required to establish whether or not the @xmath0 inferred by mg98 are correct .",
    "either way , the @xmath0 in figure  1c are 4.5 times higher than those in figure  1b , averaged over the 14 galaxies common to both samples .",
    "so either the photometric measurements are too low ( not impossible , cf .",
    "the uncertainties discussed in   4 ) , or the mg98 results are too high ( which would require mild radial anisotropy that is not inconsistent with our understanding of core galaxies , cf .   5).=-2",
    "our understanding of the bh mass distribution is still incomplete , partly due to a lack of complete representative samples that cover quiescent and active galaxies of all hubble types , and partly due to persistent uncertainties in the correct interpretation of photometric and kinematic data .",
    "however , it is clear that we are finding bhs in the correct mass range to explain quasar fueling and evolution , to within the uncertainties.=-2    i thank gerry quinlan for kindly allowing me to use his adiabatic bh growth software .",
