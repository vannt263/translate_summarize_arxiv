    "recognition of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) of light has evoked a lot of activities in different branches of physics over last two decades .",
    "spin angular momentum ( sam ) is carried by the polarization of light while oam is by helical phase front .",
    "being an extrinsic property , oam generally affects the c.m .",
    "motion of an atom , whereas , sam of field determines the selection rules of electronic transitions . in our recent work @xcite",
    ", we have shown that optical oam can be transferred to electronic motion via quantized c.m .",
    "motion of ultracold atoms within paraxial approximation . for focused optical vortex beam ,",
    "parxial approximation breaks down and non - paraxial effects @xcite become important .",
    "new realm of physics can be explored for atoms or molecules interacting with non - paraxial ( focused ) optical vortex where the sam and the oam are no longer conserved separately but the total angular momentum ( oam+sam ) is conserved in interaction with an atom or a molecule @xcite .",
    "the interesting feature of focused optical vortex is that the oam of light can be transferred to the electronic motion or the sam of light can affect the c.m .",
    "motion of an atom even at dipole approximation level unlike that in the case of paraxial approximation . considering direct coupling of field oam with the internal motion of atoms ,",
    "many applications are proposed in literature , such as second - harmonic generation in nonlinear optics @xcite , new selection rules in photoionization @xcite , strong dichroism effect @xcite , charge - current generation in atomic systems @xcite , the suppression of parasitic light shifts in the field of quantum information and metrology experiments with single atoms or ions @xcite , new selection rules in off - axis photoexcitation @xcite , etc .",
    "the non - paraxial vortex beams have applications in different fields of research such as , quantum information processing @xcite , trapping of atoms @xcite or microparticles @xcite in optical twizers , cell biology @xcite etc .    here",
    "we develop a theory for the interaction of non - paraxial vortex beam with an atom and apply this to the creation of superposition of matter wave vortices in an atomic bose einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "we show the possibility to create multiple quantized circulations of bec using single focused optical vortex pulse , unlike that in earlier works @xcite where multiple optical vortices were used . to transfer the oam from the light to the c.m .",
    "motion of matter , the wavelength of the matter wave has to be large enough to feel the intensity distribution of the optical vortex beam .",
    "so , this theory will be applicable to cold atoms . since the spread of wavefunction of cold single trapped atom is very narrow",
    ", transfer mechanism is appreciable for large number of cold atoms , like , bec .",
    "the main question we address in this paper is about the sharing mechanism of the total angular momentum of a focused optical vortex between the external c.m . and internal electronic motions of an atom .",
    "we show that there are three possible ways of distributing the total field angular momentum between c.m .",
    "and electronic motions . we call them as angular momentum channels ( amc ) of interaction .",
    "the atoms interact with the lg beam via different amcs having probabilities that depend on corresponding transition strengths and focusing angles .",
    "the formalism of corresponding interaction is developed in section ii .",
    "section iii describes numerical calculations of a proposed method of creation of superposition of bec vortex states using non - paraxial lg beam .",
    "section iv discusses some examples of superposition of bec vortex states , like vortex - antivortex pair , which can be created by our proposed method giving simulated interference patterns .",
    "finally , in section v , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the focused non - paraxial beam considered here is produced from a circularly polarized paraxial pulse with oam by passing it through a lens with high numerical aperture ( na ) .",
    "the consequent spin - orbit coupling of light is based on debye - wolf theory @xcite , where an incident collimated lg beam is decomposed into a superposition of plane waves having an infinite number of spatial harmonics . in a non - paraxial beam ,",
    "the total angular momentum is a good quantum number . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "whenever we mention about sam or oam , it should be understood that we mean the corresponding angular momentum of the paraxial lg beam before passing through the lens .",
    "we consider that the focused @xmath0 beam ( @xmath1 is oam of light beam @xcite and @xmath2 is radial node of laguerre polynomial ) interacts with cold atoms whose de broglie wavelength is large enough to feel the intensity variation of the focused beam . for non - paraxial",

    "the amplitude of the focused electric field is @xmath9 , where we have assumed @xmath10 is the objective transmission amplitude , @xmath11 is the amplitude of incident electric field and @xmath12 is the focal length related with @xmath13 by @xmath14 ( abbe sine condition ) .",

    "any one of the above conditions for @xmath47 is satisfied , depending on the polarization of light ( @xmath48 ) and we have only one amc of interaction .",
    "but in interaction with non - paraxial light all the possibilities of @xmath47 open up for @xmath49 or -1 .",
    "these generate three possible electronic hyperfine sublevels , as discussed later , in the atoms of bec as seen from eq .",
    "( 5 ) . but",
    "total angular momentum has to be conserved .",
    "therefore , as seen from the equation , we get three possible orbital angular momentum states of the c.m . of the atoms corresponding to the above electronic states .",

    "motion and the polarization of light interacts with the electronic motion of the atom @xcite .",
    "but the second and third terms of this equation imply that the polarization of the light can also affect the external motion of c.m . of the atoms .",

    "if any part of tam goes to the electron , it generates electronic transitions satisfied by the electromagnetic selection rules .",

    "these factors are numerically evaluated ( see section iv ) after estimating the wavefunctions of c.m . and electronic states of the system . in the next section ,",
    "we study two - photon stimulated raman transition using a focused lg beam and predict interesting effects .",
    "generation of quantized vortices in a bec using optical vortex has become important due to the experimental endeavors @xcite over last decade .",
    "the coherent superpositions of vortices of different circulation quantum numbers , especially vortex - antivortex cases @xcite , yield interesting interference effects with potential applications @xcite , such as manipulating the chirality of twisted metal nano - structures @xcite .",
    "creation of matter - wave vortex states from a non - rotating bec by two - photon raman transition method under paraxial lg and gaussian ( g ) pulse is well discussed in literature @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "matter - wave vortex is shown to acquire vorticity equal to the winding number of the lg beam .",
    "we consider a focused lg beam is interacting with a non - rotating @xmath55na bec , prepared in @xmath56 state in a harmonic potential .",
    "the lg pulse induces dipole transitions in atoms as given in eq .",
    "the final state will have three different hyperfine sublevels shown in fig . 1 . to bring back the matter in the initial state using two - photon stimulated raman transition , we require three simultaneous co - propagating gaussian pulses with suitable frequencies and polarizations to be shined in the same direction of lg field as shown in fig .",
    "because of co - propagation of the gaussian pulses with lg field , net transfer of linear momentum to the atoms is zero .",
    "two - photon transitions of matter state through the three hyperfine sublevels of excited state can be defined as three channels discussed below .",
    "this procedure yields the possibility of three vorticities in the bec and creates the superposition of vortices at the initial hyperfine sublevel . since the interference pattern of the superposition will depend on the populations of the vortex states , the rabi frequencies corresponding to these two - photon transitions are important to quantify .    for axial confinement of the trap",
    ", the quantum state of the condensate can be described by a wave function @xmath57 in two dimensions . in the zero - temperature limit ,",
    "the dynamics of the weakly interacting bec is described by the gross - pitaevskii equation in cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "let us consider a non - paraxial lg beam , produced from a paraxial lg field with oam=+1 and sam=+1 , and followed by gaussian beams incident on bec . as a result , a superposed vortex state with vorticity @xmath58 will be created . in general , the three different macroscopic vortices with vorticities @xmath1 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( originated from oam=@xmath1 and sam=@xmath7 ) superpose with arbitrary proportion and this superposition can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath61    where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is chemical potential of the system .",

    ", we notice that these transitions are non - negligible and become significant with high focusing angles .",
    "the finiteness of these two transitions at small focusing angle ( @xmath86 ) may be due to the inclusion of diffraction feature during the conversion of paraxial to non - paraxial beam .",
