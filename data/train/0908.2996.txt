    "the _ fermi _ lat pair production telescope has been surveying the 20mev@xmath2300gev @xmath0-ray sky since 2008 august 11 . among the many sources being detected by this mission , blazars dominate the extragalactic sky .",
    "the first published set of these objects , the ` lat bright agn sample ' ( lbas ) based on 3 months of sky survey exposure , included 132 bright ( @xmath3 ) detections at @xmath4 .",
    "the bulk ( 117 ) of these sources have been associated with flat spectrum radio counterparts , which in turn end up being mostly well - known flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl lac objects .",
    "a few additional sources are pulsars and a few remain unidentified . the associations are based on the distribution of radio and x - ray properties of the radio counterparts ( crates ; healey et al .",
    "2007 ) and the analysis allows a quantitative assessment of the probability of association .    even before the start of the _ fermi _ mission , it was recognized that a large sample of these blazars would be needed for source identification ; in the candidate gamma - ray blazar survey ( cgrabs ; healey et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) we pursued optical spectroscopy of the sources selected to be most similar to the previously known egret blazars .",
    "this set of 1625 blazars included many sources without previous spectroscopic identification . here",
    "we report on previously unpublished optical spectra from our crates / cgrabs survey and observations for new sources from the lbas list .",
    "the data allow classification of the blazar type and redshift solutions for the strong - lined objects .",
    "significant redshift constraints are also obtained for the weak - lined bl lacs .",
    "these measurements contribute ten fsrq redshifts , one new spectroscopic redshift for a bl lac , and 11 additional bl lac redshift constraints . including these new data , 91% of all lbas sources",
    "have been spectroscopically typed , 84% have redshifts , and 70% of the bl lac have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we also use our spectra to examine the black hole masses and optical continua of these blazar sources .    in this paper ,",
    "we assume an approximate concordance cosmology@xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "the bulk of the spectroscopic observations were performed with the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) at mcdonald observatory ; many of these observations were part of the cgrabs survey @xcite , but additional data were taken on newly discovered lbas sources .",
    "the het observes in the declination range @xmath9 , and is fully queue scheduled @xcite , allowing us to receive data remotely year round and to spread the cost of inclement weather and unfavorable conditions among the observing programs .",
    "we use the marcario low - resolution spectrograph , lrs @xcite , with grism g1 ( @xmath10 lines mm@xmath8 ) , a 2@xmath11 slit , and a schott gg385 long - pass filter for a resolution of @xmath12 between @xmath13   and @xmath14  .",
    "typical exposures are @xmath15 s for fsrq objects and @xmath16 s for bl lac objects , with the slit placed along the parallactic angle .",
    "we also used the double spectrograph ( dbsp ) on the @xmath17 m hale telescope at palomar .",
    "the observations with a 1@xmath11 slit at the parallactic angle used a @xmath18 line mm@xmath8 grating on the blue side , covering @xmath19 at a resolution of @xmath20  ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the red camera , with a @xmath22 line mm@xmath8 grating covers @xmath23 , at a resolution @xmath24  ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "p200/dbsp is our primary tool for targets outside of the het declination range ( i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and provides extra spectral coverage and resolution in the blue for bright bl lacs .",
    "typical exposures were @xmath28 s for fsrqs and up to @xmath29 s for faint bl lacs .",
    "data reduction was performed with the iraf package @xcite using standard techniques .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed with a neon - argon lamp at the het and on the red side at dbsp , and iron - argon on the dbsp blue side . for these relatively faint objects ,",
    "we employ an optimal extraction algorithm @xcite to maximize the s / n .",
    "we perform spectrophotometric calibration using standard stars from @xcite . in most cases",
    "the standard exposures from the data night were suitable , but at the het , standards from subsequent nights were sometimes used .",
    "due to differential slit losses and variable conditions between object and standard star exposures , we estimate that the accuracy of our absolute spectrophotometry is @xmath30 @xcite , although the relative spectrophotometry is considerably better .",
    "spectra are corrected for telluric absorptions and visually cleaned of cosmic rays .",
    "multiple exposures on a single target are combined into a single spectrum , weighting by s / n .",
    "we visually identify and measure emission line equivalent widths and fwhms and derive redshifts from these line measurements .",
    "they are listed in table 1 .",
    "line and redshift measurement techniques are discussed in  3.1 .",

    "these redshifts were previously listed in @xcite .",
    "all redshifts are confirmed by multiple emission lines and derived by cross - correlation analysis using the rvsao package @xcite .",

    "the fluxes , as above , have uncertainties as large as 30% due to unknown slit losses .",
    "the spectral index uncertainties are estimated by fits to independent subsets of the spectral range .",
    "the properties of strong emission lines are listed in table 1 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the broad emission lines h@xmath37 , , and , as their virialized broad components are used to make estimates of the black hole mass . for these lines , we take care to measure the gaussian full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the broad component , avoiding contamination by other spectral features .    for h@xmath37 , it is important to include narrow components in the line fit .",
    "we fit the continuum to a power law , and , following @xcite , we simultaneously fit broad and narrow h@xmath37 , narrow [ ] 4959  , and narrow [ ] 5007  .",
    "we require rest wavelengths of narrow h@xmath37 and the [ ] lines to match laboratory values ; the broad h@xmath37 wavelength was free .",

    "the continuum measurement is , as usual , made at 3000  , to avoid fe contamination @xcite .",
    "lines sometimes suffer strong associated absorption , but such corrections were modest for the few cases presented here .",
    "also , for consistency with the sdss measurements ( see below ) and to minimize sensitivity to associated absorbers we report here the fhwm of the actual line @xcite .",
    "we can use the emission line measurements reported above to estimate black hole masses for the fsrq objects in our sample using the empirical ` virial ' scaling relationships @xcite .",
    "mass scaling relations have been applied to large samples of quasars in the past and are calibrated by reverberation mapping techniques @xcite .",

    "we follow @xcite in the calculation of the black hole masses : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 for ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 for h@xmath37 ; and @xmath47 , @xmath48 for .",
    "masses are plotted in figure [ fig : bh ] .",
    "values measured from spectra presented in this paper are indicated by filled points ( species used indicated by point style ) . some of the lbas fsrq have spectra in the sdss archive @xcite .",
    "we recovered these and measured line profiles and continuum fluxes exactly as for our new objects to obtain similar bh mass estimates ( open points ) .",
    "for about half of these sources , sdss published independently estimated values for @xmath49 @xcite . we find adequate agreement , with rms differences in @xmath50 of 0.04 ( h@xmath37 ) and 0.14 ( , ) , comparable to the inter - species dispersion .    in general , the virial mass estimators are of limited accuracy for individual objects . as one illustration ,",
    "when estimates are available for a given object from more than one species , we connect the points with a dashed line .",
    "the pipeline processing of the entire sloan dr5 sample of optically selected quasars provides a large number of such mass estimates . in figure",
    "[ fig : bh ] we show the mean and rms @xmath50 values as a function of redshift .",
    "for both the @xmath0-ray selected sample presented here and the optical sdss sample , the mean mass increases with redshift , likely a simple flux bias .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath0-ray sources trend about @xmath51 lower in mass than the optically selected objects , albeit with large scatter .",
    "there are several possible origins of this trend .",
    "one possibility is that this is a result of the fainter optical limit in the follow - up to the lbas sample .",
    "another selection effect may be imposed by the @xmath0-ray selection s dependence on the jet flux , which , as a strong function of the viewing angle to the relativistic jet , is more weakly dependent on the underlying source luminosity and presumably black hole mass .",
    "a final possibility stems from orientation : virial estimates ( equation 1 ) assume isotropic velocities in the broad line region .",
    "however , blazars are known to have the jet axis , and hence the black hole spin and inner accretion disk axis , close to the earth line - of - sight .",
    "if the broad line region has a toroidal structure @xcite , then blazars will have lines with fwhm decreased by @xmath52 and lower virial mass estimates than qsos viewed at larger inclination angles .",
    "larger data sets from future lat samples should allow us to probe the reality and origin of such effects .",
    "we have obtained high sensitivity ( s / n @xmath53 100 ) spectra of twelve lbas bl lacs .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we adopt here the pragmatic ` optical spectroscopic ' definition of a bl lac as a blazar lacking emission lines with observed equivalent width greater than @xmath17   and a limit on any possible 4000   spectral break of @xmath54% . for some sources in cgrabs we have seen that ,",
    "as the continuum level fluctuates , the source passes from spectroscopic bl lac to spectroscopic fsrq .",
    "we designate a source as a bl lac if during any of our observations with adequate spectral range it has satisfied the spectroscopic definition . in this connection ,",
    "one of the high - mass objects appearing in figure [ fig : bh ] should be mentioned .",
    "this is j1058 + 0133 , designated an fsrq in lbas based on a clear detection of a broad line at z=0.888 .",
    "however , this line has an ew of only 3.5  ; accordingly this blazar should be formally designated a bl lac at the epoch of the sdss spectrum .",
    "the very strong non - thermal continuum , in fact , drives up the apparent luminosity and the bh mass estimate .",
    "this emphasizes that non - thermal continuum can artificially increase the apparent mass ; the virial estimates are not calibrated for bl lac sources .",
    "the spectral range requirement for bl lac designation is that the spectrum covers @xmath55 to @xmath56 $ ] with sufficient s / n to detect at least one of the standard agn broad emission lines  ly@xmath32 , , , , h@xmath37 , or h@xmath32 . in practice",
    "this means adequate s / n over @xmath57 ; this is easily satisfied for the bl lacs in our lbas sample .    to describe the bl lac continua , we fit the spectra to a power law , using the iraf nfit1d routine .",
    "most are well fit with rising ( blue ) power - laws , suggesting a synchrotron @xmath58 peak well above the optical band .",
    "j0144 + 2705 is , however , very red .",
    "this is confirmed by usno b1/2mass fluxes which rise to the j - band and flatten above 1.5@xmath59 m .",
    "the galactic extinction in the direction of this source is @xmath60mag , so local absorption is unlikely to redden the source .",
    "it seems plausible that this bl lac has a low synchrotron peak frequency @xmath61hz .",
    "this may be tested by broader study of the sed .",
    "the spectral indices ( @xmath36 ) and fluxes of the bl lac are reported in table [ tab : bll ] . for the continuum normalization",
    "we assume the @xmath62% absolute spectrophotometric uncertainty noted above ; for the spectral indices we again estimate the dominant systematic errors from fits to non - overlapping sections of the continuum .",
    "the continuum - normalized spectra are shown in figures 3 & 4 .",
    "these plots also label notable interstellar features e.g. na @xmath63 , and the diffuse interstellar bands , or dibs @xcite .",
    "the strong dominance of the non - thermal nuclear continuum in bl lacs guarantees that the equivalent widths of any broad nuclear lines or absorption features from the host galaxy are very small .",
    "while recent work with 8 m - class telescopes has provided some redshift solutions , spectroscopic redshifts for many objects remain elusive @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , quantitative limits on host spectral features can be useful in extracting redshift constraints .",
    "for example , based on the lack of a ly@xmath32 forest - induced break in the het spectra , none of our bl lacs can have @xmath64 .",
    "this rather weak bound can be improved with uv coverage beyond the het lrs 4150  limit .",
    "also , there is good evidence , especially from hst imaging , that bl lacs reside in relatively uniform giant elliptical hosts , with @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "analysis to limit the contribution of such a host to the observed spectrum can thus provide a lower limit on the bl lac redshift @xcite .",
    "we develop here a similar spectral bound on redshift , using the ca h / k and g - band absorption features , the strongest narrow features in the host spectrum .",
