    "the peaks at @xmath10.008 and @xmath10.03 mev in the lower panel mainly come from the contributions from elastic cross section of the neutron on @xmath7fe and @xmath8fe , respectively @xcite .",
    "also , a very sharp peak at @xmath10.00115 mev which comes from the contribution of capture cross section of the neutron on @xmath8fe @xcite is shown in the lower panel . however , the probability that neutrons reach the energies of those sharp peak is very low because the peak has a very narrow width @xmath11 @xmath110 ev . for this reason ,",
    "this sharp peak at @xmath10.00115 mev does not produce a visible effect on the neutron counts .      with the energy distributions of the neutrons scored in the detector region and the conversion factors from ncrp-38 , we can obtain neutron dose equivalent rates .",
