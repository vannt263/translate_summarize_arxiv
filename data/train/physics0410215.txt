    "electron cyclotron waves can efficiently drive a localized non - inductive current in toroidal devices for a number of applications .",
    "the main of these are found in the neoclassical tearing mode control @xcite , the fully non - inductive current drive in tokamaks @xcite and the bootstrap current compensation in stellerators @xcite .",
    "eccd results from the sensitive heating of electrons travelling in one direction in order to decrease their collision frequency , and thus enhance their contribution to the toroidal current , compared to their unheated counterparts moving in the opposite direction @xcite . for an off - axis current drive ,",
    "this current drive mechanism is offset by the mirror trapping of electrons in toroidal geometries that drives current in the reverse direction @xcite .",
    "the eccd efficiency is usually calculated through a bounce - averaged quasilinear fokker - planck treatment @xcite .",
    "electron cyclotron ( ec ) waves have recently attracted a great interest .",
    "such waves exhibit the very important property of being able to be excited at a localized particular magnetic surface .",
    "this mechanism considers the introduction of ec waves at a minimum of the magnetic field , where the resonance condition @xmath0 holds .",
    "many tokamak experiments have reported that the eccd efficiency decreases as the power deposition location is moved away from the plasma center , either by varying the magnetic field strength @xcite or by changing the poloidal steering of the eccd launcher @xcite .    in the low power limit",
    ", the eccd can be calculated from the relativistic , linearized fokker - planck equation using ray tracing codes @xcite .",
    "if the effects of the radiofrequency ( rf ) quasilinear diffusion and the parallel electric field are included , the bounce - averaged , quasilinear fokker - planck codes can be used @xcite .",
    "however , the nonlinearities associated to high power effects are not considered . in the present paper",
    "we analyze the eccd efficiency in an axisymmetric tokamak , in the low collisionallity regime within the neoclassical transport theory .",
    "the eccd is calculated including a ponderomotive force @xmath1 .",
    "the tokamak ordering is used to obtain a system of equations that describe the dynamics of the plasma where the nonlinear ponderomotive ( pm ) force due to high - power rf waves is included .",
    "the pm force is produced around an electron cyclotron resonant surface at a specific poloidal location .",
    "the eccd efficiency is analyzed in the cases of the first and second harmonics ( for different impinging angles of the rf waves ) and it is validated using experimental parameter values from tcv and t-10 tokamaks .",
    "the results obtained are in agreement with those delivered by the linearized fokker - planck equation .",

    "in order to examine the expression for the current density ( [ 31 ] ) associated with the ponderomotive force , we adopt the criteria that the deposited energy by the rf wave has to be bigger that the internal enegy ( @xmath94 ) so to include the nonlinear effects .",

    "the first and second harmonics of the @xmath97 waves were used provided that the introduction of the rf wave took place at the high magnetic field ( hf ) side .",

    ", the density profile has been modelled as a parabolic one in order to analyze the current , @xmath110 where @xmath62 is the tokamak minor radius .",

    "the driven current density has been initially obtained in a system of toroidal flux coordinates .",
    "that description of the current density is transformed in terms of the hamada coordinates @xcite which is necessary for its validation with experimental results .",

    "is analyzed as a function of the @xmath115 ratio .",
    "this is accomplished by using the parameters of the tcv and t-10 tokamaks at the first and second harmonics , assuming that the introduction of the wave takes place at the hf side . from this results , we have obtained an interval of frequencies , in agreement with the experiments , where the current shows a stable behavior .    in the particular case of a parabolic profile , it has been shown that the eccd increases with the radius , at first approximation . finally , it is important to notice that , according to @xcite , the efficiency is higher for the second harmonic as it is shown in .",
