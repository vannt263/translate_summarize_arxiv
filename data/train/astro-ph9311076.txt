    "there has been increasing interest in large voids in the galaxy distribution .",
    "however , in large - scale theory and practice , there currently exist many different definitions of a void ( for discussion see sahni , sathyaprakash & shandarin , 1993 ) .",
    "our purpose here is to present an objective and quantitative method for defining voids .",
    "we use an algorithm developed by kauffmann ( see kauffmann & melott 1992 , hereafter km ) to locate voids .",
    "we use a percolation technique suggested by shandarin ( 1983 ) in the form developed by klypin & shandarin ( 1993 , hereafter ks ) to determine the threshold density .",
    "we perform the analysis on two - dimensional n - body generated density distributions used in the work of beacom et al ( 1991 , hereafter bdmps ) .",
    "the choice of the percolation threshold is motivated by the fact that it marks a change of topology . in the absence of percolation",
    ", the regions above the density threshold are isolated . on the contrary , in two - dimensional ( hereafter 2-d ) space , if the fraction above the threshold percolates , the fraction below the threshold forms isolated voids .",
    "we perform this work in two dimensions because coding and de - bugging are obviously simpler and visualization is easier .",
    "the agreement between the 2-d work of bdmps and melott & shandarin s 3-d work ( 1993 , hereafter ms ) is very impressive , suggesting 2-d is a good guide to what will happen in 3-d .",
    "the technique can be easily applied to two - dimensional galaxy samples , as well as to the microwave temperature fluctuation maps . after testing this method in 2-d",
    "we plan to study more realistic 3-d distributions .",
    "the numerical models are the ones used in the work of bdmps .",
    "they are @xmath0 density arrays that simulate various epochs of gravitational clustering .",
    "the models are evolved with a particle - mesh code by solving poisson s equation and are equivalent to a cross - section of a three - dimensional @xmath1 frw universe with two - dimensional density perturbations .",
    "thus , they exhibit a subset of the behavior possible in three dimensions .",
    "the initial conditions for these models are pure power - law spectra with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and are analogous to @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , in three dimensions . for more detailed information",
    "see bdmps .",
    "the @xmath4 model is analogous to the cdm model on small scales , and the @xmath3 model is analogous to the part of the cdm spectrum reaching non - linearity at @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum is analogous to that part of the spectrum coming within the horizon at any moment in most inflationary theories of the generation of perturbations . for each type of initial condition",
    "we evolve density arrays representing progressive epochs by introducing a non - linearity frequency @xmath9 , which corresponds to the transition into non - linear evolution .",
    "@xmath9 is defined by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the growing mode of gravitational instability , @xmath12 for the @xmath1 universe , @xmath13 is the cosmological scale factor and , in the absence of pressure and radiation terms , @xmath14 .",
    "the non - linearity frequency is chosen to be @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the size of the simulation box ( 512 grid units ) . the nyquist frequency for these simulations",
    "is @xmath19 .",
    "additionally , we have run four realizations of each model at each epoch in order to average our results .",
    "we have , therefore , four realizations for each of six epochs in both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 simulations and for each of five epochs in the @xmath4 .",
    "we also decided to study a pure gaussian distribution for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 models .",
    "for both models we ran ten realizations of a gaussian distribution .",
    "thus we have a total of eighty - eight files studied , averaged into nineteen sets of results .",
    "we smooth each density distribution by fourier convolution with the gaussian window @xmath20 we specify the smoothing length for each distribution as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the value for which the rms density fluctuation @xmath23 . as reported in bdmps",
    ", @xmath24 is extremely stable and is more reliable than smoothing with the correlation length .",
    "another advantage of this choice is that @xmath22 in our universe is about @xmath25 , close to the mean galaxy separation .",
    "thus the smoothing will remove most noise due to discreteness effects , and may somewhat lessen the difference between the coordinate and redshift spaces .",
    "percolation theory has been a tool available to physicists for some time .",
    "it is used mainly to study phase transitions such as the spontaneous alignment of spin occurring at the curie temperature .",
    "zeldovich ( 1982 ) and shandarin ( 1983 ) were the first to apply percolation to cosmology , using it as a tool to study topological properties of non - linear density fields .",
    "in essence , we use percolation to study phase transitions also . in our case",
    "however , it is not the system under study that is evolving , we have already evolved our simulations to the various points in time or epochs we wish to study .",
    "rather , we take each of our snap shots of gravitational clustering and allow the threshold density to change .",
    "we choose an initial threshold density and increment or decrement this density until percolation in the over - dense or under - dense phase is reached using a square - lattice percolation algorithm .",
    "the percolation threshold is the point at which the transition is made from discontinuous clusters to a global cluster which spans the simulation box .",
    "the density at which this threshold is reached is called the percolation density .",
    "this percolation density is applied to the smoothed density files such that anything equal to or above percolation density becomes a 1 and anything below becomes a 0 .",
    "we call this our percolated file . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will call regions above the threshold superclusters and those below it voids. we wish to stress that these are not necessarily identical to the observationally based use of these words , and emphasize this by using single quotes .    in the ideal continuous 2-d world , percolation in the over - dense phase would mean the absence of percolation in the under - dense phase and vice - versa .",
    "however , we study percolation on a 2-d square lattice , and therefore it may be possible that neither phase percolates . in order to make the procedure symmetric , we apply the void search at the percolation threshold in the over - dense phase and , measuring the supercluster sizes , we use the percolation threshold in the under - dense phase .",
    "this technique can be used to study the largest voids when they are isolated , since the over - dense phase percolates and vice - versa .",
    "one can find a more detailed discussion of percolation in 2-d systems in dominik and shandarin ( 1992 ) .",
    "we perform a void search on the percolated file .",
    "the void search algorithm ( km ) first finds the largest square of empty cells in the percolated file .",
    "any empty cells along its four sides are then added to this base void , subject to the criterion that the length of the fill - in can not be less than two - thirds the base void length . when the fill - in is complete , the next largest square is found and cells are added to it .",
    "this process continues for smaller and smaller squares until all the voids in a particular simulation are found .",
    "we weight each void size by its predominance in the simulation .",
    "we characterize each simulation by the diameter of a circle of area equal to the weighted average void size .",
    "@xmath26 where the summations are over the range of void sizes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the weight of voids of size @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the number of voids of size @xmath29 . for purposes of comparison we performed a supercluster search by percolating along under - dense regions so that the void search was actually finding the typical sizes of the superclusters.",
    "we present the results in the form of the percentage area occupied by voids or superclusters as a function of the diameter in figures 1 - 3 , for @xmath31 respectively .",
    "panel ( a ) in figure 1 and 2 shows the distribution for the gaussian fields with the corresponding power spectra .",
    "one can see that in gaussian fields there is no statistical difference between the void and supercluster distributions , which was of course anticipated .",
    "it is worth stressing that the total area in voids and superclusters is only @xmath32 in the @xmath2 model and @xmath33 in the @xmath3 model .",
    "it reflects the fact that the void search algorithm can measure only large voids ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "one can see also that in the range @xmath34 , there are about 2.5 times more voids in the @xmath3 model than in the @xmath2 model and there are a few larger voids as well .",
    "both features are in agreement with the greater smoothness of the @xmath3 model .",
    "the non - linear stages shown in panels b through g of figure 1 and 2 show the major difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 models : in the @xmath2 model superclusters occupy more area than voids and the largest structures are also superclusters, in the @xmath3 model the opposite is true .",
    "the degenerate @xmath4 model demonstrates that voids are always the dominant structures .",
    "the @xmath2 model shows that both the voids and superclusters roughly scale with the scale of non - linearity @xmath35 , and the @xmath4 model does not , as can be seen in figure 1 through 3 and especially in figure 5 .",
    "the mean diameter of superclusters is slightly but significantly greater than that of voids in the @xmath2 model , and both are about 2 times smaller than @xmath35 , shown as a dotted line in figure 5 .    in the @xmath3 model voids",
    "are a little larger than superclusters and the difference with @xmath35 is somewhat less , about 1.8 times .",
    "the models also do not display quite as good scaling with @xmath35 as the @xmath2 model .",
    "as previously mentioned in the section on the void search routine , we do nt necessarily include all of the area below the percolation threshold in voids. the void search routine was written to approximate circular voids. this is most obvious in figure 4 , where the early epochs show a combined void/cluster area of considerably less than 100% . in the later epochs , the voids become larger and more circular ; less void area is lost due to the two - thirds requirement during fill - in ( see description of void search ) .",
    "the careful observer will also notice that a few of the data points are slightly above 100% , most noticably the last two data points on the @xmath4 ( dashed ) line .",
    "this is simply because we measure voids at the percolation threshold of the over - dense regions and superclusters at that of the under - dense regions , and these percolation thresholds are not identical .",
    "the advantages of our approach are both theoretical and practical .",
    "the smoothing we use removes discreteness effects and our choice of smoothing length is insensitive to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the use of percolation objectively defines a connected structure , and its combination with an objective measure of void size remedies its major shortcoming as a large - scale structure statistic , i.e. , it does not give rise to a physical lengthscale associated with percolating structures .",
    "as shown in earlier work , the results of percolation studies can be connected with the initial conditions that generated the structures .",

    "pmh is especially grateful for support from the nsf research expenses for undergraduates program .",
