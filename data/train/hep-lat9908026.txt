    "in recent years , evidence has been accumulated that the mechanism of quark confinement may be understood in effective theories of monopoles  @xcite or @xmath0 vortices  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "after gauge fixing , these theories arise from projecting the full su(n ) onto a gauge theory with a reduced gauge symmetry .",
    "the observation that the reduced theories reveal the full string tension nurtures the conjecture that those degrees of freedom bear confinement . here",
    ", we will employ center gauge fixing and center projection  @xcite for the reduction of su(2 ) to @xmath1 gauge theory which can be understood as a theory of vortices .",
    "we define _ vortex dominance _ if two criteria are met .",
    "firstly , the string tension is preserved by projection .",
    "secondly , the vortices survive the continuum limit .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the link variable of su(2 ) gauge theory and @xmath3 a gauge transformation matrix . maximizing the functional s_fix[u ]",
    "\\ { u^_(x ) ^a u^ _ ( x ) ^a } , [ eq:1 ] with respect to @xmath3 yields the gauge transformation matrices which , when applied , cast a given configuration in the center gauge . _ center projection _ is performed by the mapping of the link variable @xmath4 onto @xmath5 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in practical calculations , finding",
    "the absolute maximum of the functional @xmath6 is a difficult task .",
    "the results which are presented in the next section were obtained by applying the algorithm presented in  @xcite , which resorts to iteration with over - relaxation .",
    "once the iteration does not change the functional @xmath6 any more up to a given precision , we performed a random gauge transformation on the actual link configuration and repeat the center gauge fixing .",
    "the procedure is repeated up to ten times .",
    "we finally choose the configuration @xmath3 which corresponds to the maximum value within the series of the ten fixing steps .",
    "this alleviates , but does not eliminate , the gribov problem ( see section  4 ) .",
    "_ zero temperature : _ it turns out that the effective @xmath1 gauge theory which was constructed with the itov - algorithm sketched above shows vortex dominance : the string tension is preserved  @xcite , and the linking number of the vortex lines with a wilson loop ( vortex density ) meets with the expectations from a renormalization group analysis  @xcite .",
    "also the vortex interactions scale .",
    "these observations suggest that the vortices are physical objects surviving the continuum limit  @xcite .    _ finite temperatures : _ we find that below the deconfinement temperature @xmath7 vortex dominance persists  @xcite . in particular , the effective @xmath1 gauge theory correctly reproduces the critical temperature thus indicating that the essence of the deconfinement phase transition can be captured in the vortex picture .",
    "a thorough study of the density of vortices which are linked to spatially oriented wilson loops shows that the vortex state at high temperatures is in agreement with the predictions of dimensional reduction  @xcite . on the other hand , the density of vortices linked with time - like wilson loops only drops by a factor of three if the temperature is raised to twice @xmath7 .",
    "additional information is needed to understand the drop of the string tension to zero at @xmath7 .",
    "we argue  @xcite that while the vortices are organized in a huge cluster at zero temperature , they stop percolating at @xmath7 and the huge cluster decays into many small size clusters .",
    "if in the later case the size of the wilson loop exceeds the average cluster size , only vortices close to the circumference of the wilson loop contribute yielding a perimeter law . in order to substantiate this idea , we measured the probability that a link of the vortex belongs to a cluster of given size .",
    "the result is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "further details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the variety of results in the previous section was obtained by implementing the center gauge ( see ( [ eq:1 ] ) ) with the help of the itov algorithm sketched in section  2 .",
    "it was recently pointed out that this procedure does not evade the gribov problem  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was observed that implementing the landau gauge before applying the itov algorithm leads on average to a larger maximum value of @xmath6 ( [ eq:1 ] ) than attained by the direct use of the itov algorithm .",
    "moreover , the vortex state constructed from the gauge fixing via the landau gauge detour does _ not _ show vortex dominance .",
    "these results cast doubt on the issue of vortex dominance in the strict _ maximal _ center gauge and call for a more accurate specification of the gauge in which the results outlined in section  3 were really obtained .",
    "for this specification , we here propose a new type of gauge fixing procedure which we will call _ quantum gauge fixing _ ( qgf ) .",
    "we will argue that the itov algorithm of section  2 already contains some of the characteristics of qgf rather than representing a numerically stable implementation of the maximal center gauge . defining the @xmath8 matrices _",
    "ab ( x ) & : = & \\ { ( x ) ^a ^(x ) ^b } , [ eq:3 ] + r^_ab ( x ) & : = & \\ { u_(x ) ^a u_^(x ) ^b } , [ eq:4 ] the gauge fixing functional @xmath6 ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be cast into s_fix = _ \\{x } ^t ( x+ ) r^(x ) ( x ) .",
    "[ eq:5 ] center gauge fixing corresponds to maximizing ( [ eq:5 ] ) with respect to the matrices @xmath9 for a given lattice configuration , i.e. , @xmath10 . from given matrices @xmath11 ,",
    "the gauge transformation @xmath3 can be constructed up to a center gauge transformation , f^z_su : su(n)/z_n su(n ) : = f^z_su ( ) . [ eq:6 ]",
    "this ambiguity reflects the familiar fact that the maximal center gauge condition leaves a residual @xmath0 gauge group unfixed .",
    "we define the qgf as follows : by means of a functional integral over gauge transformations @xmath9 , we construct the matrix : = f^z_su ( ) \\ { _ f s_fix } , [ eq:7 ] which in general is not an element of the gauge group .",
    "the gauge transformation @xmath3 which brings a given field configuration @xmath2 into the quantum gauge is then defined by the su(n ) element  closest  to @xmath12 $ ] , i.e. , ( x ) - ( x ) ^2 , x , [ eq:8 ] where @xmath13",
    ". it can be shown that the qgf ( [ eq:7]-[eq:8 ] ) is free of gribov ambiguities . in the case of the center gauge fixing ( [ eq:5 ] ) , the functional integral in ( [ eq:7 ] ) can be viewed as a partition function of the matrices @xmath9 each interacting with its nearest neighbors via the metric @xmath10 .",
    "this quantum theory of matrices @xmath9 is therefore interpreted as generalized spin glass .",
    "spin glass systems are known for a complex phase structure .",
    "a numerical calculation of the expectation value ( [ eq:7 ] ) is therefore tedious , and we recover the gribov problem in practical applications .",
    "nevertheless , qgf is helpful to put the results outlined in section  3 in the proper context . for this purpose",
    ", we consider large values of the gauge parameter @xmath14 in ( [ eq:7 ] ) . in this case , the configuration @xmath11 which corresponds to a local maximum of @xmath6 contributes to @xmath15 with the ( semi - classical ) weight \\ { _ f s_fix } / ^1/2 , [ eq:9 ] where @xmath16 is the functional determinant of the second ( functional ) derivative of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "eq.([eq:9 ] ) implies that the contributions of maxima with large curvature are suppressed .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure  2 . since the itov algorithm of section  2 involves several steps of iteration which start with a random choice of @xmath9 , it probes the volume of the region of attraction corresponding to a particular maximum .",
    "the itov algorithm therefore effectively contains a similar entropy factor as the one implied by ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "we therefore argue that the results shown in section  3 refer to a gauge which is more akin ( but not completely identical ) to qgf than to the strict maximal center gauge ."
