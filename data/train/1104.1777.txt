    "in a successful description of small @xmath4 dis proposed in seminal papers by golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw model ) @xcite , a cross - section for virtual photon - proton scattering in dis reads:@xmath5 here @xmath6 is the wave function describing dissociation of a virtual photon into a @xmath7 dipole and @xmath8 is a dipole - proton cross - section .",
    "the main assumption of the gbw model is that @xmath8 which in principle is a function of two independent variables : dipole size @xmath9 and dipole - proton energy @xmath10 ( or bjorken @xmath4 ) , depends in practice only on a certain combination of these two variables , namely on the product @xmath11 where@xmath12 is called a saturation scale .",
    "bjorken @xmath4 is defined as@xmath13 here @xmath14 gev and @xmath15 are free parameters whose precise values can be extracted by fitting ( [ redsig ] ) to the hera data .",
    "power @xmath16 is known to be of the order @xmath17 .    for transverse photons ( neglecting quark masses):@xmath18 \\overline{q}^{2}k_{1}^{2}(\\overline{q}r )    \\label{psit}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a modified bessel function . from eq .",
    "( [ psit ] ) it follows that@xmath21 where we have explicitly factored out @xmath22 . defining new variable @xmath23 , new function @xmath24 and _ scaling variable _",
    "@xmath26 we arrive at:@xmath27 it follows that @xmath28 is a function of scaling variable @xmath29 , rather than a function of two variables @xmath30 and @xmath4 .",
    "this phenomenon is known as geometrical scaling ( gs)@xcite .",
    "gs has been observed in dis data for @xmath31 .    in the golec - biernat ",

    "dis structure function is proportional to @xmath35 :    @xmath37    at first sight eq .",
    "( [ sigf2 ] ) may look contradictory , since left hand sides depend on @xmath22 and the right hand sides do not . in practice ,",
    "exact calculation of the integral in ( [ redsig ] ) renders some mild @xmath22 dependence of the right hand sides .",
    "moreover dglap evolution introduces @xmath36 dependence of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the effective saturation scale can be conveniently parameterized as@xmath39 exponent @xmath40 has been extracted from the hera data @xcite .",

    "in pp collisions we do not have a viable model of low and medium @xmath42 particle production at high energies .",

    "unfortunately rhic energies are presumably too low for geometrical scaling to work .",
    "nevertheless we show below , that approximate gs can be seen in the rhic data . to this end",
    "we choose the phobos @xmath3 distributions measured in gold - gold and copper - copper collisions at 62.4 and 200 gev per nucleon @xcite .    here",

    "we see again that the rescaled spectra seem to fall on one curve , although the alinement of au and cu spectra is not perfect for small and medium values of @xmath94 .",

    "in this paper we have demonstrated that geometrical scaling originally postulated in deep inelastic scattering @xcite is also exhibited by the @xmath3 spectra in hadronic collisions mclerran:2010ex , praszalowicz:2011tc . to this end",
    "recent cms data khachatryan:2010xs have been analyzed and shown to scale with scaling variable @xmath25 defined in eqs.([taudef],[qsdef ] ) . a simplified model of gribov , levin and ryskin @xcite has been used to motivate the appearance of gs in hadronic collisions .",
    "this model can be apriori used to study the shape of the universal scaling function @xmath59 which deserves a separate study .",
    "a notable difference between dis and hadronic collisions is that in dis we deal with totally inclusive cross - section , whereas in pp both hadronization and final state interactions play essential role .",
    "nevertheless the imprint of the saturation scale @xmath97 is visible in the spectra , which means that the information on the initial fireball survives until final hadrons are formed .",
    "it has been shown that the quality of geometrical scaling is improved if the exponent @xmath16 becomes @xmath3-dependent praszalowicz:2011tc in accordance with @xmath98-dependence of @xmath99 obtained from dis .",
    "this is a remarkable feature that supports the picture in which medium @xmath3 particles are produced from saturated gluonic matter irrespectively of the scattering states .",
    "if so , geometrical scaling should be also present in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the detailed studies will be certainly carried out at the lhc . here we have analyzed phobos data @xcite for two rhic energies and for two different nuclei : gold and copper , and the onset of geometrical scaling has been clearly seen .",
    "interestingly , we have found that the exponent @xmath16 that governs geometrical scaling in heavy ion collisions is higher than the one in pp .",
    "this is in striking agreement with the fact that multiplicity growth with energy observed by alice @xcite is faster in heavy ions than in pp .",
    "question arises to what extent the hydrodynamical evolution of the quark - gluon plasma is going to wash out geometrical scaling that is present in the initial state .",
    "further studies should also concentrate on centrality and rapidity dependence of gs .",
    "the author wants to thank larry mclerran for a number of stimulating discussions that triggered this work and andrzej bialas for discussion and encouragement .",
    "special thanks are due to barbara wosiek for the guidance through the wealth of heavy ion rhic data .",
