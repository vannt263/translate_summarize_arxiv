    "the aim of this work is to present an improved and more general technique related with ndim ( negative dimensional integration method ) , iri , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which we have called method of brackets .",
    "this modification to ndim was originally presented in @xcite in the context of multiloops feynman integrals .",
    "a complete description of the operational rules of the method , together with a variety of examples related with feynman diagrams and a generalization to arbitrary integrals , was discussed in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the usefulness of this technique in analytic continuation of trascendental functions was also discussed , specifically for hypergeometric functions of the form @xmath0 .",
    "the method of brackets is a versatile and simple technique for evaluating feynman diagrams up to a certain level of difficulty .",
    "the reason for this is the complexity of solutions , which are presented in terms of multiple hypergeometric series in the general case .",
    "the method of brackets is a heuristic method for the evaluation of definite integrals , whose great advantage is to reduce the evaluation of a large class of definite integrals to the solution of a linear system of equations .    until now",
    "this technique does not have a rigorous mathematical proof . in this work",
    "we show that the method of brackets is a generalization of ramanujan s master theorem ( rmt ) . however , this theorem is not sufficient to explain mathematically the bracket s technique in complete form .    in our case",
    "the application of the method of brackets to feynman diagrams requires the schwinger s parametric representation of diagram . then through of a systematic procedure it is possible to obtain the analytical solution to this diagram as a sum of hypergeometric functions . in this work we present two simple examples describing , step by step the application of the method of brackets and the ramanujan s master theorem",
    "an arbitrary diagram with @xmath1 loops , @xmath2 propagators and @xmath3 independent external lines , has the following associated momentum integral in @xmath4 dimensions in minkowski space,@xmath5where we define ( explicit or implicity ) :    * @xmath6momentum of the @xmath7-@xmath8 @xmath9 propagator or internal line .",
    "it is a linear combination of external momenta @xmath10 and internal momenta @xmath11 . *",
    "@xmath12arbitrary indices @xmath13",
    ". * @xmath14external momentun @xmath15 .",
    "* @xmath16internal momentum @xmath17 . * @xmath18mass associated to the - @xmath7-@xmath8 propagator .    in this case",
    "the corresponding schwinger s parametric representation is given by the equation    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are polynomials @xmath1-@xmath24 and @xmath25-@xmath26 respectively in schwinger s parameters .",
    "the polynomials @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be evaluated using the general formula igo1",
    "@xmath27    where the coefficients @xmath28 are given for the following determinant    @xmath29    the @xmath30 matrix , the parameter matrix , may be evaluated directly from topology of the diagram .",
    "in the following we show the fundamental rules of this technique .",
    "the technique of brackets transforms the parameter integral into series - like structure called : `` brackets expansion '' .",
    "we need only four basic rules for obtaining such an expansion .      to expand the exponential function",
    ", we use the `` usual '' way , this is    @xmath31    if the argument of exponential function is @xmath32 , we expand in this way    @xmath33    the reason for this is to associate to each expansion the factor @xmath34 as a simple convention",
    ".      this rule corresponds to the definition of the bracket symbol .",
    "the structure @xmath35 @xmath36 is replaced by its respective bracket representation    @xmath37      for polynomials we use the following representation in terms of series of brackets    @xmath38    this rule is derived using rule @xmath39 and @xmath40 after applying the schwinger s parametrization to this polynomial .",
    "an adequate way for expanding repeated polynomials in the integral is described in @xcite , the idea in this case is to minimize the complexity of the solution .      for the case of a generic series of brackets @xmath41",
    "@xmath42    the solution is obtained using the general formula    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is evaluated by the following expression    @xmath45    and @xmath46 @xmath47 is the solution of the linear system obtained by the vanishing of the brackets    @xmath48    the value of @xmath41 is not defined if the matrix @xmath49 is not invertible .",
    ": in the case where a higher dimensional series has more summation indices than brackets , the appropriate number of free variables is chosen among the indices .",
    "for each such choice , rule @xmath50 yields a series .",
    "those converging in a common region are added to evaluate the desired integral .    in the evaluation of these formal sums",
    ", the index @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath2 will be replaced by a number @xmath53 defined by the vanishing of the bracket .",
    "observe that it is possible that @xmath53 @xmath52 @xmath54 . for book - keeping purposes , specially in cases with many indices , we write @xmath55 instead of the usual @xmath56 .",
    "after that the brackets are eliminated , those indices that remain recover their original nature .    some simple examples and their respective expansions in brackets :    * for binomial expression    @xmath57    * for integral    @xmath58",
    "in the following we describe the ramanujan s master theorem and its relation with the method of brackets .",
    "the theorem says that for an integral @xmath59 , where , we suppose that @xmath60 admits a taylor expansion of the form    @xmath61    in a neighborhood of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then the solution is given by    @xmath64    this integral corresponds to the mellin transform of @xmath60 .",
    "the condition @xmath65 guarantees the convergence of integral in @xmath66 near @xmath62 , for @xmath67 .",
    "this theorem was demostrated by hardy @xcite .",
    "we present a generalization to this theorem when it is applied to the multidimensional integral    @xmath68    if @xmath69 is expressible in the form of multidimensional taylor series as follows    @xmath70    then we obtain the expression    @xmath71    being @xmath72 @xmath73 . after applying sistematically ramanujan s master theorem to the integral ,",
    "we find by method of induction , the general solution for this integral    @xmath74    where @xmath44 is evaluated by the formula    @xmath75    and the variables @xmath76 are solutions of the following linear system    @xmath77    we have obtained ramanujan s master theorem generalized ( rmtg ) .",
    "this general formula @xmath78  is equivalent to the general formula obtained with the method of brackets for integral @xmath41 @xmath79 .",
    "this result justifies mathematically the method of brackets as a valid method for evaluating multidimensional integrals .",
    "many examples are discussed in references @xcite .",
    "in the following we discuss two examples . the first example using the method of brackets and a second example using rmtg .",
    "we start with the evaluation of the following feynman diagram    @xmath80{triangle.eps } \\end{minipage}\\ ] ]    the momentum integral for this graph is    @xmath81    we also define the set @xmath82 as the set of powers of the propagators , which in general can take arbitrary values . the schwinger s parametric  representation of the eq .",
    "@xmath83 is the following integral    @xmath84    where @xmath85 .",
    "the polynomials @xmath86 and @xmath28 are given by the following equations    @xmath87    inserting this in @xmath88 and remembering that @xmath89 , after a little algebra , we get the schwinger s parametric representation of @xmath83 @xmath90now , we solve the diagram with the following conditions ( for simplicity ) : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , then , we obtain the following integral for this case    @xmath95    in the following we obtain the expansion of brackets ( step by step ) . first , we expand the exponential functions using rule @xmath39    * @xmath96 * @xmath97    then , we obtain the integral    @xmath98    now , we expand the polynomial @xmath99 using rule @xmath100    @xmath101    then using rule @xmath40 and a little algebra allows us to find the expansion of brackets associated to the integral @xmath102    @xmath103    where the symbols @xmath104 represent the brackets    @xmath105    using rule @xmath106 we find finally the solution to @xmath107 . in this case",
    "exists two kinematical regions : @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the solution in the region @xmath110  is given by the following expression    @xmath111    the solution for the region @xmath109 are obtained by analytic continuation of @xmath112 .",
    "we will solve the following diagram    @xmath80{bubble.eps } \\end{minipage } \\label{t6}\\ ] ]    the schwinger s parametric representation is given by the expression    @xmath113    now , we expand the integrand using conventional mathematics    @xmath114    resulting the following integral    @xmath115    then , we expand the binomial in the denominator    @xmath116    replacing in @xmath117 and doing a change of variables : @xmath118 , we obtain finally the optimal structure for applying rmtg , this is    @xmath119    allows us to obtain the solution of the diagram @xmath120    @xmath121",
    "the method of brackets has been presented as an competitive alternative compared with other advanced techniques for evaluating feynman diagrams .",
    "the main advantage of this technique is that it is systematic and it does not require advanced mathematical tools , just linear algebra . although , this technique is not fully explained by rmtg , the results obtained by method of brackets are identical to the obtained with rmtg when the number of the summation indices is the same as the number of the brackets . if the number of the brackets is less than the number of the summation indices , rmtg is not useful to explain the obtained results by applying method of brackets , although these results are correct .",
    "we are currently working on studies to fully validate this technique through the mathematical point of view .",
