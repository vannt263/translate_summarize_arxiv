    "the recent neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with robust evidence that neutrinos have tiny masses and their flavor mixing involves two large angles and one small angle @xcite . a global analysis of current neutrino oscillation data yields @xmath3ev@xmath4 @xmath5ev@xmath4 and @xmath6ev@xmath4 @xmath7ev@xmath4 for the squared mass differences of solar and atmospheric neutrinos and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the flavor mixing angles at the @xmath11 confidence level ( the best - fit values are @xmath12ev@xmath4 , @xmath13ev@xmath4 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16)@xcite . where we define @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "there are two important questions : ( 1 ) why are the two neutrino mixing angles large , almost maximal , and is the one angle small ? and ( 2 ) why are the neutrino masses so tiny ?",
    "tri / bi - maximal mixing is the one of the lepton mixing ansatz to answer the first question , which is characterized by the following mixing matrix @xcite @xmath21 the texture of this matrix consists of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the tri / bi - maximal mixing matrix could approximately describe the best fit values of the current neutrino oscillation data : @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "recently , many theoretical efforts have been made to produce the tri / bi - maximal mixing pattern arising from some relevant symmetries@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , an attractive idea to answer the second question is given by the seesaw mechanism @xcite which explains the smallness of the neutrino masses through the existence of right - handed majorana neutrinos . among many realistic seesaw models existing in the literature",
    ", the minimal seesaw model contains only two right - handed majorana neutrinos , thus it is the most economical one @xcite .",
    "also , the seesaw mechanism provides a very natural explanation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe through the baryogenesis via leptogenesis scenarios @xcite .",
    "the baryon asymmetry has been measured by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) as a baryon - photon ratio @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the leptogenesis scenarios in the minimal seesaw model have been studied by many groups @xcite . however , as mentioned below , if we try to analytically solve the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath26 in terms of the observed element of the light neutrino mass matrix , it is sometime assumed that at least one of the elements in @xmath26 should be fixed to a constant or we should assume an equality between two or more entries in the matrix @xmath26 .",
    "for example , some groups have estimated the baryon asymmetry with the following dirac mass matrix @xmath27 which is so - called texture one - zero mass matrix .",
    "however , it is a natural question , what happen if the @xmath28 element deviates from zero ?",
    "this is our question in this paper .",
    "we show the brief review of the minimal seesaw model .",
    "the minimal seesaw lagrangian can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the left - handed ( light ) neutrinos , the left - handed charged leptons and the right - handed ( heavy ) neutrinos , respectively .",
    "we have assumed that the mass matrices of both the heavy neutrinos @xmath33 and the charged lepton @xmath34 are diagonal and real .",
    "the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath26 is a @xmath35 rectangular matrix , which can be written by 6 parameters ( @xmath36 ) as @xcite @xmath37    via the well - known seesaw mechanism , we can obtain the symmetric @xmath38 majorana mass matrix for light neutrinos as @xmath39 and which yields the following equation @xmath40 this equation contains 6 parameters , however , we have only 5 independent condition , the sixth condition is redundant because of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if we choose one of the elements in the dirac mass matrix @xmath42 as a constant term , we can analytically solve 5 parameters out of 6 of @xmath26 in terms of the element of the light neutrino mass matrix .",
    "for @xmath43 , the solution in terms of @xmath44 or @xmath45 is @xmath46 @xmath47 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath48 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath49 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : reconstruction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the last equation is a consistency condition due to @xmath41 and we can use it to fix the sign of @xmath54 .",
    "the solution in terms of @xmath55 or @xmath1 is obtained under the exchanges @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , for @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , under the transformations @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 with @xmath69 , we obtain the solutions in terms of @xmath70 or @xmath71 for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath74 is also calculated to be @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the diagonal neutrino mass matrix and @xmath77 is the maki - nakagawa - sakata mixing matrix which can be parameterized by    @xmath78    where @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
    "there are two types of the leptonic cp violation phases : one is the dirac phase @xmath82 and the other are the two majorana phases @xmath83 if neutrinos are majorana particle @xcite .",
    "now , we can reconstruct the dirac mass matrix elements @xmath42 in term of the low energy neutrino observables @xmath84 and cp violating phases @xmath85 with heavy neutrino masses @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , in the framework of the minimal seesaw model , @xmath41 condition holds if one of the neutrino mass eigenvalue @xmath87 is exactly zero @xcite . as a result",
    ", the experimental results of the square mass differences can be explained by the two types of mass hierarchies .",
    "one is called normal mass hierarchy : @xmath88 , and the other is called the inverted mass hierarchy : @xmath89 .",
    "we give an outline of the leptogenesis .",
    "the baryon - photon ratio @xmath90 can be translated into the baryon asymmetry @xmath91 as @xmath92 , and in leptogenesis scenario , this baryon asymmetry produced via the sphaleron process is related to the lepton asymmetry @xmath93 @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of generation of fermions and @xmath96 is the number of higgs doublets . in the particle contents of the standard model , @xmath97 and @xmath98 thus @xmath99 .    the lepton asymmetry @xmath93 is parameterized by three term , the dilution factor @xmath100 , the cp - asymmetry parameter @xmath101 and the effective number of relativistic degree of freedom @xmath102 @xmath103 where , for instance , we have @xmath104 in the standard model .",
    "the dilution factor @xmath100 describes the wash - out of the lepton asymmetry due to the various lepton number violating processes .",
    "we should solve the full boltzmann equations to determine the magnitude of the dilution factor exactly ; however , we can use good analytical approximation by nielsen and takanishi in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 , where @xmath109 with the planck mass @xmath110 gev and the vacuum expectation value of the higgs particle @xmath111 gev .",
    "the cp asymmetry @xmath101 have generated by the decay processes of the heavy majorana neutrino : @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the higgs doublet in the standard model .",
    "now , we assume a hierarchical mass pattern of the heavy neutrinos @xmath114 . in this case , the interactions of @xmath115 can be in thermal equilibrium when @xmath116 decays and the asymmetry caused by the @xmath116 decay is washed out by the lepton number violating processes with @xmath115 .",
    "thus , only the decays of @xmath115 are relevant for generation of the final lepton asymmetry @xmath117 . in this case , the cp asymmetry parameter in the minimal seesaw model calculated to be @xcite : @xmath118}{(m_d^\\dagger m_d)_{11 } } f\\left(\\frac{m_2}{m_1 } \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{m_2}{8\\pi v^2 } \\frac{\\textrm{im}\\left[(a_1^\\ast b_1 + a_2^\\ast b_2 + a_3^\\ast b_3)^2 \\right]}{\\vert a_1 \\vert^2 + \\vert a_2 \\vert^2 + \\vert a_3 \\vert^2}f\\left(\\frac{m_2}{m_1 } \\right ) , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath119 is given by @xmath120.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "as we have already addressed , the leptogenesis scenarios in the minimal seesaw model has been studied many groups in the case that at least one of the elements in the dirac neutrino mass matrix are fixed to zero , such as the @xmath0 case : @xmath121 then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mnu ] ) , the low energy neutrino mass matrix @xmath74 can be written by five parameters ( @xmath122 ) as @xmath123 and we can analytically explain these five parameters in terms of the five independent elements in the low energy neutrino mass matrix .    however , to solve the dirac mass matrix we can take not only @xmath0 but also @xmath124 where @xmath125 is an any constant .",
    "@xmath126 there are six non - vanishing entries but there are only five independent parameters . then , the low energy neutrino mass matrix can be written by five parameters ( @xmath122 ) as @xmath127 this is same situation of @xmath0 case and we can analytically obtain these five parameters in terms of the five independent elements in @xmath74 again .",
    "thus , @xmath128 is just special case of the @xmath129 , e.g , both @xmath0 case and @xmath2 case such as @xmath130 are in same ground for reconstruction of the dirac mass matrix elements in term of the low energy observables .    in this section ,",
    "we ask the question , what happen if the @xmath1 element deviate from zero ? to answer this question , we estimate the @xmath1 dependence to the baryon - photon ratio @xmath90 by numerical calculations .",
    "first , we choose the @xmath1 range .",
    "the solution of the elements in the dirac mass matrix in the term of @xmath1 is obtained as @xmath131 etc .",
    "thus , we take @xmath132 with a parameter @xmath133 and use the following parameterization : @xmath134 , \\nonumber\\\\ a_3 & = & \\frac{1}{m_{22}}\\left [ a_2m_{23 } - \\sigma_3b_2\\sqrt{m_{22}m_{33}-m_{23}^2}\\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ b_1 & = & \\frac{1}{m_{22}}\\left [ b_2m_{12 } + \\sigma_1a_2\\sqrt{m_{22}m_{11}-m_{12}^2 } \\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ b_3 & = & \\frac{1}{m_{22}}\\left [ b_2m_{23 } + \\sigma_3a_2\\sqrt{m_{22}m_{33}-m_{23}^2}\\right ] , \\nonumber\\\\ m_{13 } & = & \\frac{1}{m_{22 } } \\left [ m_{12}m_{23 } \\right .",

    "also , we assume the light neutrinos have the normal hierarchical mass pattern with @xmath139ev@xmath4 and @xmath13 ev@xmath4 . in this case , only one majorana phase @xmath140 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : umns ] ) is physically relevant .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] . according to the relation of @xmath153 ,",
    "if the dilution factor @xmath100 increases or decreases simply with @xmath133 , we can expect that the baryon - photon ration @xmath90 also has several minimums and maximums .",
    "indeed , the dilution factor @xmath100 decreases with @xmath133 as shown in fig .",

    "also , it has been pointed out that in some cases the nielsen s approximations could underestimate the suppression in the baryon asymmetry due to the washout effects @xcite .",
