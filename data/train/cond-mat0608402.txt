    "hard - sphere packings have been used to model a variety of systems , including liquids @xcite , amorphous and granular media @xcite , and crystals @xcite .",
    "there has been resurgent interest in hard - sphere packings in dimensions greater than three in both the physical and mathematical sciences .",
    "for example , it is known that the optimal way of sending digital signals over noisy channels corresponds to the densest sphere packing in a high dimensional space @xcite .",
    "these  error - correcting \" codes underlie a variety of systems in digital communications and storage , including compact disks , cell phones and the internet .",
    "physicists have studied hard - sphere packings in high dimensions to gain insight into ground and glassy states of matter as well as phase behavior in lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "the determination of the densest packings in arbitrary dimension is a problem of long - standing interest in discrete geometry @xcite . the _ packing density _ or simply density @xmath16 of a sphere packing is the fraction of space @xmath1 covered by the spheres , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number density , @xmath19 is the volume of a @xmath0-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the gamma function .",
    "we call @xmath22 the _ maximal density _ , where the supremum is taken over all packings in @xmath1 .",
    "the sphere packing problem seeks to answer the following question : among all packings of congruent spheres , what is the maximal packing density @xmath23 , i.e. , largest fraction of @xmath1 covered by the spheres , and what are the corresponding arrangements of the spheres @xcite ? for @xmath24 and @xmath15 , the optimal solutions are known .",
    "for @xmath25 , the densest known packings of congruent spheres are bravais lattice packings @xcite , but in sufficiently large dimensions the optimal packings are likely to be non - bravais lattice packings .",
    "upper and lower bounds on the maximal density @xmath23 exist in all dimensions @xcite .",
    "for example , minkowski @xcite proved that the maximal density @xmath26 among all bravais lattice packings for @xmath27 satisfies the lower bound @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "it is seen that for large values of @xmath0 , the asymptotic behavior of the _ nonconstructive _ minkowski lower bound is controlled by @xmath30 .",
    "note that the density of a _ saturated _ packing of congruent spheres in @xmath1 for all @xmath0 satisfies @xmath31 which has the same dominant exponential term as ( [ mink ] ) .",
    "a saturated packing of congruent spheres of unit diameter and density @xmath16 in @xmath32 has the property that each point in space lies within a unit distance from the center of some sphere . in the large - dimensional limit",
    ", kabatiansky and levenshtein @xcite showed that the maximal density is bounded from above according to the asymptotic upper bound @xmath33    the present paper is motivated by some recent work on disordered sphere - packings in high dimensions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduced a generalization of the well - known random sequential addition ( rsa ) process for hard spheres in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 .",
    "this model can be viewed as a special  thinning \" of a poisson point process such that the subset of points at the end of the thinning process corresponds to a sphere packing .",
    "one obvious rule is to retain a test sphere at time @xmath34 only if it does not overlap a sphere that was successfully added to the packing at an earlier time .",
    "this criterion defines the standard rsa process in @xmath1 @xcite , which generates a homogeneous and isotropic sphere packing in @xmath1 with a time - dependent density @xmath35 . in the limit @xmath36 , the rsa process corresponds to a saturated packing with a maximal or _",
    "density @xmath37 @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "the rsa process is commonly known as the  car parking problem \" , which re ' nyi showed has a saturation density @xmath38 @xcite . for @xmath39 , an exact determination of @xmath40",
    "is not possible , but estimates for it have been obtained via computer experiments in two dimensions ( circular disks ) @xcite and three dimensions ( spheres ) @xcite .",
    "however , estimates of the saturation density @xmath40 in higher dimensions have heretofore not been obtained .",
    "another thinning criterion retains a test sphere centered at position @xmath41 at time @xmath34 if no other test sphere is within a unit radial distance from @xmath41 for the time interval @xmath42 prior to @xmath34 , where @xmath43 is a positive constant in the interval @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "this packing is a subset of the rsa packing , which we call the generalized rsa process .",
    "note that when @xmath45 , the standard rsa process is recovered , and when @xmath46 , we obtain the  ghost \" rsa process @xcite , which is amenable to exact analysis . in particular , we showed that the @xmath47-particle correlation function @xmath48 for the ghost rsa packing can be obtained analytically for any @xmath47 , all allowable densities and in any dimension .",
    "this represents the first exactly solvable disordered sphere - packing model in arbitrary dimension . for statistically homogeneous packings in @xmath1 ,",
    "these correlation functions are defined so that @xmath49 is proportional to the probability density for simultaneously finding @xmath47 particles at locations @xmath50 within the system , where @xmath18 is the number density .",
    "thus , in a packing without long - range order , each @xmath51 approaches unity when all particle positions become widely separated within @xmath1 , indicating no spatial correlations . the fact that the maximal density @xmath52 of the ghost rsa packing implies that there may be disordered sphere packings in sufficiently high @xmath0 whose density exceeds minkowski s lower bound ( [ mink ] ) .    indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a conjectural lower bound on the density of disordered sphere packings @xcite was employed to provide the putative exponential improvement on minkowski s 100-year - old bound .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the conjectural lower bound is controlled by @xmath53 .",
    "these results suggest that the densest packings in sufficiently high dimensions may be disordered rather than periodic , implying the existence of disordered classical ground states for some continuous potentials .",
    "in addition , a _",
    "principle for disordered packings was identified @xcite , which states that _ unconstrained _ correlations in disordered sphere packings vanish asymptotically in high dimensions and that the @xmath51 for any @xmath54 can be inferred entirely from a knowledge of the number density @xmath18 and the pair correlation function @xmath55 . at first glace",
    ", one might be tempted to conclude that the decorrelation principle is an expected  mean - field \" behavior , which is not the case .",
    "for example , it is well known that in some spin systems correlations vanish in the limit @xmath56 and the system approaches the mean - field behavior . while this notion is meaningful for spin systems with attractive interactions , it is not for hard - core systems .",
    "the latter is characterized by a total potential energy that is either zero or infinite , and thus can not be characterized by a mean field .",
    "furthermore , mean - field theories are limited to equilibrium considerations , and thus do not distinguish between  constrained \" and  unconstrained \" correlations that arise in non - equilibrium packings of which there an infinite number of distinct ensembles .",
    "the decorrelation principle is a statement about any disordered packing , equilibrium or not .",
    "for example , contact delta functions ( constrained correlations ) are an important attribute of non - equilibrium jammed disordered packings and have no analog in equilibrium lattice models of any dimension .",
    "finally , the decorrelation principle arises from the fact that the kabatiansky - levenshtein asymptotic upper bound on the maximal packing density ( [ kab ] ) implies that @xmath16 must go to zero at least as fast as @xmath57 for large @xmath0 and therefore , unconstrained spatial correlations between spheres are expected to vanish , i.e. , statistical independence is established @xcite .",
    "there is no counterpart of the kabatiansky - levenshtein bound in mean - field theories .    motivated by these recent results ,",
    "we study the structural properties of standard rsa packings ( @xmath45 for the generalized rsa process ) in the infinite - time or saturation limit , generated via computer simulations , for the first six euclidean space dimensions ( @xmath58 ) . the algorithm is checked by reproducing some known results for @xmath24 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "although we know that the saturation density @xmath40 is bounded from below by @xmath30 @xcite , the manner in which @xmath40 scales with density is not known for @xmath59 .",
    "one objective of this paper is to answer this question .",
    "another aim is determine the corresponding pair correlation functions and structure factors in order to ascertain whether decorrelations can be observed as the space dimension increases up to six .",
    "a byproduct of our high - dimensional analysis is a relatively sharp lower bound on the saturation density of rsa packings for any @xmath0 .",
    "although a palsti - like conjecture ( the saturation density in @xmath1 is equal to that of the one - dimensional problem raised to the @xmath0th power ) is exact for ghost rsa packings , we rigorously prove that this conjecture can not be true for standard rsa packings .    in appendix",
    "a , we obtain kissing ( contact ) number statistics for saturated rsa configurations on the surface of a @xmath0-dimensional sphere for dimensions @xmath12 and compare to the maximal kissing numbers in these dimensions . in appendix b , we determine the structure factor exactly for ghost rsa packings and show that its distance from  hyperuniformity \" @xcite increases as the space dimension increases , approaching a constant asymptotic value .",
    "here we collect some known asymptotic results for the standard rsa process for @xmath0-dimensional hard spheres .",
    "henceforth , we call @xmath60 the saturation ( infinite - time ) limit of the density .    in his numerical study of rsa hard disks , feder @xcite postulated that the asymptotic coverage in the long - time limit for @xmath0-dimensional hard spheres follows the algebraic behavior @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents a dimensionless time .",
    "theoretical arguments supporting feder s law ( [ feder ] ) have been put forth by pomeau @xcite and swendsen @xcite . not surprisingly , the saturation limit is approached more slowly as the space dimension increases .    moreover , similar arguments lead to the conclusion that the pair correlation function @xmath63 at the saturation limit possesses a logarithmic singularity as the dimensionless radial distance @xmath64 for spheres of diameter @xmath65 approaches the contact value , independent of dimension @xcite , i.e. , @xmath66 boyer _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also showed that the pair correlation function for @xmath67 has _ super - exponential _ decay .",
    "specifically , they found that at any finite time @xmath62 or density @xmath16 , @xmath68 thus , @xmath69 is a short - ranged function at any density .",
    "this super - exponential decay of the pair correlation function persists in higher dimensions as well . as we will discuss in section iv",
    ", this rapid decay of @xmath70 has implications for the analytic properties of the structure factor @xmath11 .",
    "in what follows , we describe an efficient procedure to generate rsa packings in the saturation limit as well as the methods used to compute structural information , such as the density , pair correlation function , structure factor and cumulative coordination number .",
    "we present a computationally fast method to generate rsa configurations of hard spheres in the saturation limit in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied to a hypercubic fundamental cell of side length @xmath71 and volume @xmath72 .",
    "spheres of diameter @xmath65 are placed randomly and sequentially inside the fundamental cell , which is periodically replicated to fill all of @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 , until the saturation limit is achieved .    in order to speed up the computation , we attempt to add a particle only in the available space rather than wasting computational time in attempting to add particles anywhere in the fundamental cell @xcite .",
    "this requires keeping track of the time - dependent available space , which is the space exterior to the union of the _ exclusion _ spheres of radius @xmath65 centered at each successfully added sphere at any particular time .",
    "this is done by tessellating the hypercubic fundamental cell into smaller , disjoint hypercubic  voxels , \" which have side length between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , depending upon the dimension .    at the start of the simulation ,",
    "all voxels are declared accessible to particle placement .",
    "there are two stages involved to determine the time - dependent available space .",
    "a coarse estimation of the available space is used in the first stage , which is refined in the second stage . in the first stage",
    ", a particle is successfully added to the simulation box , provided that it does not overlap any existing particle . to avoid checking for nonoverlaps with every successfully added particle to the simulation box",
    ", we employ a  neighbor list \"  @xcite , which amounts to checking within a local neighborhood of the attempted particle placement . for each successfully added particle ,",
    "all voxels located within the largest possible inscribed hypercube centered at the exclusion sphere of radius @xmath65 that are fully occupied by the particle are declared to be part of the unavailable space .",
    "the voxels outside this hypercube but within the exclusion sphere may be partially filled . in the initial stages ,",
    "such partially filled voxels are declared to be part of the available space .",
    "we call these accessible voxels .",
    "if there have been at least one million unsuccessful placement attempts since the last accepted particle placement , we move to the second stage to refine our determination of the available space . in particular",
    ", we determine whether each remaining accessible voxel from the first stage can accommodate a particle center by a random search of each accessible voxel .",
    "after about 1000 random placement attempts , a particle is either added to a particular voxel or this voxel is declared to be part of the unavailable space .",
    "this search is carried out for all other accessible voxels .",
    "the simulation terminates when all voxels are unavailable for particle addition in the second stage .",
    "this two - stage procedure enables us to generate rsa packings that are saturated or nearly saturated .",
    "generating truly saturated rsa packings becomes increasingly difficult as the space dimension increases , as the asymptotic relation ( [ feder ] ) indicates .      at any instant of time",
    "@xmath62 , the number @xmath75 of added particles for a particular configuration is known and the density @xmath76 is computed from relation ( [ phi ] ) with @xmath77 .",

    ". the system size @xmath80 is sufficiently large so as produce a histogram for @xmath81 or @xmath4 that is gaussian distributed .",
    "although we do not present the full distribution of densities here , we do report the associated standard errors . in order to estimate the true saturation density @xmath4 , the volume of the available space @xmath82 as a function of dimensionless time @xmath62 is recorded in the very late stages , namely , for the last ten particles added . the saturation density @xmath4",
    "is estimated from this late - stage data by plotting @xmath76 versus @xmath83 [ cf .",
    "( [ feder ] ) ] and extrapolating to the infinite - time limit .",
    "however , to perform the extrapolation properly the time increment between each particle addition can not be taken to be uniform but instead must increase with increasing time in order to account for the fact that we only attempt to add particles in the available space . in the very late stages , this time increment @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 the stopping density @xmath86 always bounds the saturation density @xmath87 from below , but as we will soon see , @xmath86 is very nearly equal to the saturation density @xmath4 .",
    "we obtain the pair correlation function @xmath63 at the nearly - saturated stopping density @xmath86 for a specific configuration by generating a histogram of the average number of particle centers @xmath88 contained in a concentric shell of finite thickness @xmath89 at radial distance @xmath64 from an arbitrary reference particle center  @xcite .",

    "the expression ( [ factor2 ] ) provides a means for computing the structure factor by fourier transforming the real - space total correlation function in @xmath1 .",
    "if one is interested in the large - wavelength ( small @xmath93 ) behavior , however , the large @xmath64 behavior of @xmath117 must be known with high precision .",
    "even for relatively large simulation cells , it is difficult to access this large-@xmath64 asymptotic behavior . in such instances , it is better to compute the structure factor directly from the collective density variables , i.e. , @xmath118 where @xmath119 are the collective density variables , angular brackets denote an ensemble average , and @xmath109 are the wave vectors appropriate for the periodic cell of volume @xmath120 . for the hypercubic fundamental cell of side length @xmath71 considered here ,",

    "for @xmath129 , the average kissing number @xmath130 . the fact that the maximal kissing number configurations ( @xmath131 ) in @xmath132 are nonunique implies that a configuration of 12 spheres has a positive ( albeit small ) probability of occurring via an rsa process . nonetheless , we were not able to observe such a configuration in a total of @xmath133 configurations .",
    "the smallest observed kissing number for @xmath129 was six , which presumably is the smallest number required for a saturated packing .",
    "the minimal kissing number configurations for saturation are related to the following problem : how can @xmath47 points be distributed on a unit sphere such that they maximize the minimum distance between any pair of points ? for six points , the solution to his problem is well known : they should be placed at the vertices of an inscribed regular octahedron . since the minimum angular separation between any pair of points in this highly symmetric case is 90 degrees , the associated kissing number configuration is saturated .",

    "apparently , achieving kissing numbers that approach those of the optimal highly symmetric , rigid 24-cell configuration by a random sequential addition is effectively impossible .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that the possible configurations corresponding to kissing numbers of 19 - 23 are also characterized by high degree of symmetry ( and possibly rigidity ) based upon the absence of such kissing numbers .",
    "the fact that the average kissing number for @xmath136 is substantially lower than the highest known kissing number of 40 is presumably related to the high symmetries required to achieve high @xmath137 values in this dimension .",
