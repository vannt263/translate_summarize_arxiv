    "in theory , the constituent particles of a crystalline material are perfectly ordered on a periodic lattice and thus exhibit long - ranged translational and orientational order . in two dimensions ,",
    "the crystalline structure adopted by a system of identical circular particles interacting isotropically in the absence of external fields is invariably hexagonal .",
    "however , at finite temperature , long wavelength fluctuations that would have divergent energy cost in three dimensions are stable in 2d , reducing translational order @xcite .",
    "the result is that , except in the close packed limit , two - dimensional systems exhibit only quasi - long - ranged translational order characterised by algebraically decaying translational correlation functions . in spite of this , orientational ordering remains long - ranged in the two - dimensional hexagonal crystal @xcite .",
    "intermediate between the hexagonal crystal and the isotropic fluid is the hexatic phase characterised by exponentially decaying translational correlations ( short ranged translational ordering ) and algebraically decaying orientational correlations ( quasi - long - ranged orientational ordering ) @xcite .",
    "it is often useful to consider ideal single crystals consisting of an infinite array of particles located on a lattice . the experimental reality , however , is rarely so perfect .",
    "real crystalline materials commonly feature grain boundaries and other defects which reduce their long - ranged order and modify their properties compared to a single crystal .",
    "for example , the yield stress of a polycrystalline material depends upon the size of crystalline grains . in the micrometre size regime ,",
    "smaller grains result in a stronger material @xcite while nanocrystals show the opposite behaviour : softening on decreasing grain size @xcite .",
    "the crossover between these behaviours is material dependent but is typically located at a lengthscale in the tens of nanometres .",
    "similarly , the optical properties of crystalline materials are also dependent on the distribution of defects due to , for example , scattering from grain boundaries @xcite or pores @xcite .",
    "defects and grain boundaries may arise from the presence of impurities in a crystal @xcite and thus controlling the concentration and morphology of impurities allows the tuning of material properties .",
    "here we investigate a quasi - two - dimensional colloidal crystal in the presence of aspherical impurities and demonstrate their effect on the structural properties of the system .",
    "colloids are an attractive model system for the study of many general phenomena due to their experimentally accessible time and length scales allowing real - space observation and the extraction of particle - level information .",
    "two - dimensional colloidal crystals are of interest for a range of applications from templating the growth of three - dimensional crystals ( colloidal epitaxy ) @xcite , through designing phononic @xcite and photonic @xcite bandgap materials , to surface coatings @xcite , adhesives and lubrication technologies as well as offering fundamental insight into the behaviour of atomic and molecular materials @xcite .    previous investigation has focused on the effect of impurities that are either much larger @xcite or much smaller @xcite than their host colloids on crystallisation in three dimensions .",
    "these studies demonstrate that the texture of a colloidal polycrystal can be controlled through suitable choice of impurity size and concentration .    here",

    "is a polycrystalline system consisting of hexagonal domains separated by disordered grain boundaries , as shown in figure [ figpictures ] ( a ) .",
    "impurities tend to deform the hexagonal lattice in their vicinity [ figure [ figpictures ] ( a ) and ( b ) ] and are often observed at grain boundaries .",
    "we identify defects in the crystalline lattice through the local co - ordination number , @xmath21 , found via a voronoi decomposition of the system such as is shown in figure [ figpictures ] ( c ) . here",
    "yellow cells represent six - fold co - ordinated particles while red and blue cells are five - fold and seven - fold co - ordinated respectively and are considered to be defects .",

    "impurities are distinguished from the majority spherical particles by the eccentricity in their particle image , with particles having @xmath33 identified as impurities .",

    "[ figimpchar ] ( a ) . only a very small number of particles have an eccentricity above the threshold .",
    "the eccentricity distributions for impurities and non - impurity particles are plotted separately in the main panel .",
    "this shows that the eccentricity of impurities , characterising deviation from a circular shape , varies between @xmath17 and @xmath34 and thus all impurities are not identical in shape while the eccentricity of non - impurity particles is peaked at @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ figimpchar ] ( b ) shows the distributions of particle image radius of gyration for impurities ( solid line ) and non - impurity particles ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that the dashed line does not peak at @xmath36 due to the fact that the particle image is composed of a bright spot surrounded by a dark halo .",
    "this measure characterises only the size of the central bright spot and is thus smaller than the true particle radius .",
    "the non - impurity distribution is sharply peaked suggesting uniformity in the size of non - impurity particles .",
    "this contrasts with the radius of gyration of impurity particle images which is much more broadly distributed , showing a wide variation in the size of impurity particles .",
    "this variation contributes to the uncertainty in the overall area fraction .",
    "the image of a particle alone is not always a good indicator of its true size , especially when the particle is irregularly shaped @xcite , and as such estimating the area occupied by a given impurity is challenging .",
    "related to this is the issue of quantifying the polydispersity of a population of irregularly shaped objects , which is also conceptually difficult @xcite .",
    "the polydispersity in a quantity @xmath15 is given by @xmath37 and we independently compute the polydispersities in impurity image eccentricity and radius of gyration to be @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these values suggest that while there is variation in the size and shape of impurities , it is not excessive and as such we proceed in our investigation characterising each sample using only the time - averaged impurity concentration .",
    "figure [ figimpchar ] ( c ) shows the distribution of co - ordination number for impurities ( square points and solid line ) and non - impurity particles ( circular points and dashed line ) . while non - impurity particles tend to have six neighbours as expected in the hexagonal crystal , impurities have a strong tendency towards over co - ordination , that is , having @xmath40 or even @xmath41 neighbours .",
    "this is likely due to the slightly increased size of impurities over non - impurity particles and has implications for the manner in which local structure is modified in the vicinity of an impurity .",

    "considering initially particles with six or fewer neighbours , a strong peak is observed at @xmath47 , the same location as the peak in fig .",
    "[ figimpchar ] ( b ) for non - impurity particles .",
    "thus it is generally the majority spherical particles that are six - fold and under co - ordinated .",
    "these distributions for over co - ordinated particles , however , show a broadening of the majority particle peak , indicating a tendency for particles with @xmath40 or @xmath41 neighbours to be larger than average  _ i.e. _ impurities .",
    "this finding echoes that presented in fig .",
    "[ figimpchar ] ( c ) .",
    "the noise in the curves for @xmath43 and @xmath44 are due to poor statistics resulting from the rarity of these co - ordination numbers .",
    "this relationship between particle size and co - ordination number is key to understanding the modifications to local structure in the vicinity of aspherical impurities .",
    "firstly , we investigate structure as a function of distance from an impurity particle , essentially treating each impurity as if it were alone in the sample .",
    "figure [ figrecovery ] shows the variation of @xmath48 ( a ) and co - ordination number ( b ) as a function of distance from an impurity for a single experiment at impurity concentration @xmath49 .",
    "both quantities are temporally and spatially averaged and @xmath50 is normalised by the average @xmath48 such that it tends towards @xmath51 at large @xmath52 .",
    "this approximation ignores any collective effect that multiple impurities may have on nearby particles . however , at distances less than the average distance between impurities , @xmath53 , this approach is expected to be reasonable . as a comparison",
    "the insets in figure [ figrecovery ] show the variation in the same quantities with distance from a non - impurity particle .",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath21 are suppressed in the vicinity of an impurity and rise towards the average value after some distance .",
    "the suppression of the peaks in these plots is not seen in the data shown in the insets , suggesting that this effect is a direct consequence of the presence of an impurity .",
    "the implication is that , in the vicinity of an impurity , local hexagonal ordering is suppressed and average co - ordination number is reduced , indicative of defects in the hexagonal lattice .",
    "this is also evident in the voronoi tesselation shown in figure [ figpictures ] ( c ) .",
    "that these defects in the vicinity of impurities tend to be under co - ordinated ( five neighbours ) rather than over co - ordinated ( seven neighbours ) is explored below .    in order to extract a lengthscale characterising structural recovery on moving away from an impurity , the peaks of the data in figure [ figrecovery ] ( a ) and ( b ) are fit with a plateau function of the form @xmath54\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are fit parameters .",

    "furthermore , @xmath57 can be interpreted as a typical lengthscale for structural recovery on moving away from an impurity and is consistently of the order of @xmath51 particle diameter , a lengthscale smaller than the average distance between impurities , @xmath58 .",

    "inset shows average fraction of 6-fold co - ordinated particles as a function of distance from an impurity.,width=302 ]    that figure [ figrecovery ] ( b ) shows a reduction in the average co - ordination number on approaching an impurity suggests a preference for 5-fold over 7-fold co - ordinated defects directly adjacent to an impurity .",
    "figure [ figneighfrominc ] plots the local average defect fractions , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as a function of distance from an impurity for the same experiment previously considered in figure [ figrecovery ] ( a ) and ( b ) and indeed supports this interpretation . for the experimental data shown ,",
    "a particle that neighbours an impurity is 5-fold co - ordinated @xmath62 of the time , while further from the impurity the average background level of @xmath63 is recovered .",
    "seven - fold co - ordination is slightly suppressed directly adjacent to an impurity before showing a small enhancement in the second nearest neighbour layer and subsequently returning to the background average level .",
    "the inset to figure [ figneighfrominc ] shows the local average fraction of 6-fold co - ordinated particles as a function of distance from an impurity .",
    "as previously suggested by figure [ figrecovery ] ( b ) , 6-fold ordering is suppressed in the vicinity of the impurity where the hexagonal structure is distorted .",
    "qualitatively , this behaviour is observed in all experimental samples .",
    "the excess of 5-fold defects adjacent to an impurity is understandable when one appreciates that , due to their eccentric shape , impurities are often themselves 7- , 8- or even 9-fold co - ordinated . in hexagonally",
    "ordered systems , 5-fold and 7-fold defects tend to appear in pairs ( topologically , the pair is a dislocation ) and as such , over co - ordinated ( @xmath64 ) and under co - ordinated ( @xmath65 ) particles have a tendency to cluster , or , in the case of grain boundaries , form strings @xcite .",
    "since impurities are misshapen and tend to be over co - ordinated , it is expected that their neighbours are likely to be under co - ordinated .",
    "furthermore , this observation also explains the small enhancement in the fraction of 7-fold defects around @xmath66 from an impurity , as the under co - ordinated particles adjacent to the impurity subsequently increase the likelihood of over co - ordination in the second nearest neighbour shell .",
    "such chaining of defects to form grain boundaries is evident in the voronoi decomposition shown in figure [ figpictures ] ( c ) .",

    "data offset vertically for clarity.,width=302 ]    having described the effect of impurities in isolation we now consider the consequences of varying the impurity concentration on the structure of the colloidal monolayer .",
    "first we calculate the radial distribution function , @xmath67 , defined as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the particle number density and the indices run over all particles .",
    "this function is related to the probability of finding a particle located a distance @xmath52 from an arbitrary reference particle .",
    "figure [ figgr ] shows @xmath67 for three experimental samples of differing impurity concentration ( blue , green and red lines ) as well as data from monte carlo simulation of a single hexagonal crystal at the experimental volume fraction @xmath20 ( black line ) .",
    "the sharpness of the first peak in the experimentally measured @xmath67 is indicative of hard - disc - like interparticle interactions while the splitting of subsequent peaks is characteristic of the organisation of particles on an hexagonal lattice .",
    "while these peaks are well defined even at large distances in the simulated single crystal , in the polycrystalline experimental samples they become increasingly poorly defined beyond @xmath73 .",
    "this indicates a loss of positional correlations on such lengthscales compared to the single crystal .",
    "the experimental curves are very similar to one another , with the exception of a slight sharpening of the peaks at the lowest impurity fraction pictured ( blue ) .",
    "this is true of all experimental samples .",
    "greater distinction between polycrystalline structures at differing impurity concentration is obtained by considering the defect populations .",
    "figure [ figdefectspsi6 ] ( a ) shows the variation of the fraction 5-fold ( red ) and 7-fold ( blue ) co - ordinated particles with impurity fraction . an increase in the number of impurities leads to a similar increase in both 5- and 7-fold defects and a corresponding reduction in the fraction of particles having six neighbours ( inset ) . in all samples there",
    "is an excess of 5-fold defects over their 7-fold counterparts , which is attributed to the preference for under co - ordination directly adjacent to an impurity .",
    "in addition to increasing the incidence of defects in the hexagonal lattice , an increase in impurity concentration reduces the average @xmath48 of a sample , as shown in figure [ figdefectspsi6 ] ( b ) .",
    "these two observations are related to one another , as @xmath48 calculated for a defect particle is likely to be reduced compared to that of a 6-fold co - ordinated particle in the hexagonal lattice .",
    "hence , introducing impurities creates defects in the lattice , the presence of which reduces the average value of @xmath48 .",
    "this is evident when @xmath48 measured in polycrystalline samples is compared to that of the simulated single crystal at the same area fraction [ open diamond in figure [ figdefectspsi6 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "the simulation is free from defects and thus exhibits very high @xmath48 .",
    "the question now arises as to whether the average size of a crystalline grain in our polycrystalline monolayers depends on the fraction of impurities .",
    "this question is approached in two ways : through orientational correlations in local structure and by directly identifying and subsequently characterising the polycrystalline grains .",
    "when moving across a grain boundary , a change in the orientation of the hexagonal lattice is typically seen , as shown in figure [ figpictures ] ( d ) where the voronoi cells are coloured based on the local phase angle of @xmath48 .",
    "the orientational correlation function , @xmath74 where particles @xmath23 and @xmath75 are separated by a distance @xmath52 , characterises spatial correlations in this alignment and is typically used to classify the range of orientational ordering .",
    "fluids exhibit only short - ranged orientational order and thus exponential decay of @xmath76 , while in the hexatic phase @xmath76 decays algebraically with distance indicating quasi - long - ranged ordering . a single hexagonal crystal results in a non - decaying @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "figure [ figg6xi6 ] ( a ) shows three representative orientational correlation functions calculated using experimental data and @xmath76 measured in monte carlo simulation of a single hexagonal crystal at @xmath20 ( black points ) . in the single crystal this function is non - decaying , indicating long ranged orientational ordering . for our polycrystalline samples at comparable area fraction , however , the envelope of the orientational correlation function is always best fit with an exponential decay [ dashed lines in figure [ figg6xi6 ] ( a ) ] , as previously reported for quasi - two - dimensional polycrystalline colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "these fits are of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the correlation length characterising a typical distance over which orientational order decorrelates .",
    "this is our first measure of polycrystalline grain size .",
    "this correlation length is plotted as a function of impurity fraction in figure [ figg6xi6 ] ( b ) . a downwards trend in @xmath78 on increasing @xmath79",
    "is evident suggesting that orientational correlations decay over a shorter range when more impurities are present indicating smaller grains .",
    "the scatter in these data is attributed to a combination of factors including small variations in area fraction between experiments and the fact that many larger grains extend beyond the finite field of view of the microscope . at low impurity concentration",
    "it is expected that @xmath78 will increase steeply as the polycrystal becomes increasingly monocrystalline and the orientational correlation function qualitatively changes from exponentially decaying to non - decaying .",
    "this is reflected in the dashed line in figure [ figg6xi6 ] ( b ) , which varies as @xmath80 , relying on the assumption that the orientational correlation length is linearly related to the mean distance between impurities .",
    "the inset explicitly shows @xmath78 plotted against @xmath80 and indeed , with the exception of a small number of outlying points , reveals an approximately linear relationship between these two lengthscales .        the second approach to characterising grain size requires direct identification of contiguous crystalline regions within our polycrystalline sample .",
    "particles are identified as part of a grain if they satisfy three criteria based on those proposed by dillmann _",
    "firstly , to be considered part of a crystalline grain particle @xmath23 must have @xmath81 and be 6-fold co - ordinated .",
    "this removes all defects and impurities from consideration and restricts the analysis to particles in strongly hexagonal local environments .",
    "the final criterion is that a particle is considered to be in the same grain as one of its neighbouring particles if the difference in the arguments of their local @xmath48 ( the phase angle ) is smaller than some cut - off . in this way ,",
    "contiguous regions of particles having similar local orientational alignment are identified as single grains .",
    "the phase angle cut - off is chosen by increasing the threshold angle from @xmath82 until large grains are identified as single objects ( see figure [ figpolyxtal ] ) .",
    "the chosen cut - off is @xmath83 .",
    "it should be noted that while variations in the phase angle between neighbouring particles within a grain must be below this threshold , the local orientation within a grain may vary over long distances , as is expected in two - dimensional crystals @xcite .",
    "figure [ figpolyxtal ] ( a ) shows a voronoi decomposition of an experimental sample in which the 6-fold co - ordinated cells are coloured based on the local @xmath48 phase angle . regions of similar colour have similar local orientation .",
    "defects are coloured light grey and impurities are dark grey .",
    "it is expected that contiguous regions of similar orientation should be identified as belonging to the same grain .",

    "contiguous regions of a single colour represent a single identified grain .",

    "additionally , due to the finite field of view it is expected that the true size of the largest observed grains is underestimated as these grains are likely to extend beyond the edges of the acquired images , reducing the average measured grain size compared to its true value .",

    "such behaviour is also reported by wang _",

    "the parameter @xmath75 is calculated using the standard deviation of the distribution of the measured voronoi area distribution , @xmath99 : @xmath100 this measure of entropy characterises the deviation of the observed voronoi cell structure from that of the ideal single crystal , and thus is zero for a perfect hexagonal arrangement at area fraction @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ figentropy ] shows the measured entropy as a function of impurity concentration where we have used @xmath101 .",

    ", @xmath78 is much larger and decreases more steeply than @xmath107 . since @xmath78 characterises orientational correlations it is sensitive to the size of the largest grains .",
    "conversely , @xmath107 depends on the average grain size , which is dominated by a large number of small grains and thus is smaller than @xmath78 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the range of impurity concentrations investigated , @xmath107 is very similar to the mean distance between impurities , suggesting that the smaller grains form in the gaps between nearby impurities .",
    "the blue and red triangles in figure [ figlengthscales ] represent the structural recovery lengths @xmath108 and @xmath109 extracted from exponential fits to @xmath48 and co - ordination number as a function of distance from an impurity previously shown in figure [ figrecovery ] ( c ) .",
    "these lengthscales are independent of impurity concentration in the range considered and are consistently shorter than the mean distance between impurities .",
    "the implication of these observations is that there is a separation of lengthscales in two - dimensional polycrystals containing a low concentration of impurities .",
    "local structural distortions in the vicinity of an impurity occur only over short distances compared to the inter - impurity distance and are independent of the impurity concentration .",
    "conversely , the structure on lengthscales larger than the inter - impurity distance ( that is the size of the larger crystalline grains ) is observed to depend strongly on the impurity concentration .",
    "through experimental observations of dense colloidal monolayers we have investigated the role of impurities in determining polycrystalline structure in quasi - hard - discs .",
    "impurities in this system are of a similar size to the majority spherical particles but are aspherical such that they may be identified via their eccentricity .",
    "such impurities tend to be over co - ordinated , having @xmath110 nearest neighbours and thus introduce defects to the hexagonal lattice . as a result , in the immediate neighbourhood of an impurity ,",
    "particles tend to be under co - ordinated , giving an excess of 5-fold co - ordinated defects in the impurity s vicinity .",
    "we have shown that , on moving away from an impurity , the average co - ordination number and the local hexagonal bond orientational order parameter , @xmath29 , recover to their background values after a few particle diameters .    in the range of impurity concentrations",
    "investigated we observe an increase in the number of defects on increasing the number of impurities .",
    "this results in a decrease in average @xmath48 as the hexagonal lattice becomes increasingly disordered and polycrystalline .",
    "orientational correlations in such polycrystalline systems are found to decay exponentially as lattice alignment decorrelates on crossing a grain boundary .",
    "furthermore , as the impurity concentration is increased we find the average polycrystalline grain size decreases and the system entropy increases .",
    "although our global structural measures are limited due to the finite field of view , the trends are clear .",
    "our data show that local structural modifications due to the presence of impurities are independent of their concentration , while structure on longer lengthscales ( _ i.e _ the size of polycrystalline grains ) is determined by the impurity concentration .",
    "the lengthscale of this crossover is approximately the mean distance between impurities .",
    "the results of this investigation are primarily geometric in origin , arising from lattice distortions in the vicinity of misshapen impurities embedded in an hexagonal lattice of spherical particles . as such",
