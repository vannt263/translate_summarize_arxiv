    "it is well known that the individual lepton numbers @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are automatically conserved and the tree level lepton flavor violating @xmath2 processes are absent in the standard model @xmath13 .",
    "however , the neutrino oscillation experiments have made one believe that neutrinos are massive , oscillate in flavors , which presently provide the only experimental hints of new physics and imply that the separated lepton numbers are not conserved[1 ] .",
    "thus , the @xmath14 requires some modification to account for the pattern of neutrino mixing , in which the @xmath15 processes are allowed .",
    "the observation of the @xmath15 signals in present or future high energy experiments would be a clear signature of new physics beyond the @xmath14 .",
    "some of popular specific models beyond the @xmath14 generally predict the presence of new particles , such as new gauge bosons and new scalars , which can naturally lead to the tree level @xmath15 coupling .",
    "in general , these new particles could enhance branching ratios for some @xmath15 processes and perhaps bring them into the observable threshold of the present and next generations of collider experiments .",
    "furthermore , nonobservability of these @xmath15 processes can lead to strong constraints on the free parameters of new physics .",
    "thus , studying the possible @xmath15 signals of new physics in various high energy collider experiments is very interesting and needed .",
    "little higgs models[2 ] employ an extended set of global and gauge symmetries in order to avoid the one - loop quadratic divergences and thus provide a new method to solve the hierarchy between the @xmath16 scale of possible new physics and the electroweak scale @xmath17 . in this kind of models , the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson of a global symmetry which is spontaneously broken at some high scales .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath18 is induced by radiative corrections leading to a coleman - weinberg type of potential .",
    "quadratic divergence cancellation of radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass are due to contributions from new particles with the same spin as the @xmath14 particles .",
    "this type of models can be regarded as one of the important candidates of the new physics beyond the @xmath14 .",
    "the littlest higgs model @xmath0[3 ] is one of the simplest and phenomenologically viable models , which realizes the little higgs idea .",
    "recently , using of the fact that the @xmath19 model contains a complex triplet higgs boson @xmath20 , refs.[4,5,6 ] have discussed the possibility to introduce lepton number violating interactions and generation of neutrino mass in the little higgs scenario .",
    "ref.[5 ] has shown that most satisfactory way of incorporating neutrino masses is to include a lepton number violating interaction between the triplet scalars and lepton doublets .",
    "the tree level neutrino masses are mainly generated by the vacuum expectation value @xmath21 @xmath22 of the complex triplet @xmath20 , which does not affect the cancellation of quadratic divergences in the higgs mass .",
    "the neutrino masses can be given by the term @xmath23 , in which @xmath5 ( @xmath24 are generation indices ) is the yukawa coupling constant .",
    "as long as the triplet @xmath25 @xmath22 is restricted to be extremely small , the value of @xmath5 is of natural order one , i.e. @xmath5 @xmath26 1 , which might produce large contributions to some of @xmath15 processes[6,7 ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the contributions of the @xmath15 couplings predicted by the @xmath19 model to the @xmath15 processes @xmath27 and @xmath28 and compare our numerical results with the present experimental bounds on these @xmath15 processes , and see whether the constraints on the free parameter @xmath5 can be obtained .",
    "we further calculate the contributions of the @xmath19 model to the @xmath15 processes @xmath29 and @xmath30(@xmath31 or @xmath32@xmath33 ) , and discuss the possibility of detecting the @xmath15 signals of the @xmath19 model via these processes in the future high energy linear @xmath7 collider @xmath8 experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains a short summary of the relevant @xmath15 couplings of the scalars ( doubly charged scalar @xmath1 , charged scalars @xmath34 , and neutral scalar @xmath35 ) to lepton doublets .",
    "the contributions of these @xmath15 couplings to the @xmath15 processes @xmath36 and @xmath28 are calculated in section iii . using the current experimental upper limits on these @xmath15 processes , we try to give the constraints on the coupling constant @xmath5 in this section .",
    "section iv is devoted to the computation of the production cross sections of the @xmath15 processes @xmath29 and @xmath30 induced by the doubly charged scalars @xmath1 .",

    "the global @xmath38 symmetry is broken down to its subgroup @xmath40 at a scale @xmath41 , which results in 14 goldstone bosons @xmath42 .",
    "four of these @xmath43 are eaten by the gauge bosons @xmath44 , resulting from the breaking of @xmath39^{2}$ ] , giving them masses .",
    "the higgs boson remains as a light pseudo goldstone boson and other @xmath43 give masses to the @xmath14 gauge bosons and form a scalar triplet @xmath20 .",
    "the complex triplet @xmath20 offers a chance to introduce lepton number violating interactions in the theory .    in the context of the @xmath19 model ,",
    "the lepton number violating interaction which is invariant under the full gauge group , can be written as[5,7 ] : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are generation indices , @xmath48 and @xmath49 (= 1 , 2 ) are @xmath38 indices , and @xmath50 is a left handed lepton doublet .",
