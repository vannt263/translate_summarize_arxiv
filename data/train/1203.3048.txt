( [ cav - a ] ) for the cavity vector field @xmath39 .    the energy spectrum and the states of the hamiltonian for the closed electron - photon system have to be sought for an unspecified number of electrons as we want to open the system up for electrons from the leads later .",
    "we will be investigating systems with few electrons present in the finite quantum wire , but it is not a trivial task to construct an adequate many - body ( mb ) basis for the diagonalization of @xmath40 since in addition to geometrical and bias ( set by the leads ) considerations we have strong requirements set both by the coulomb and the photon interaction . our solution to this dilemma and a mean to keep a tight lid on the exponential growth of the size of the required many - body fock space is to do the diagonalization in two steps .",

    "we find that basis build up of the 64 lowest in energy coulomb interacting mess and 27 photon states is adequate for the transport bias windows and the electron - photon coupling to be selected later .",
