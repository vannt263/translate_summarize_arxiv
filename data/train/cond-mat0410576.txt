    "recent studies on the role of non gaussian noises on several  noise - induced phenomena \" , like stochastic resonance , resonant trapping , and noise - induced transitions @xcite , have shown the existence of strong effects on the system s response .",
    "the form of the noise source used was based on the nonextensive statistics @xcite with a probability distribution that depends on @xmath0 , a parameter indicating the departure from gaussian behavior : for @xmath1 the distribution is gaussian , while different non gaussian distributions result for @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "what was observed was an enhancement of the signal - to - noise ratio in stochastic resonance , an enhancement of the trapping current in resonant trapping , and a marked shift in the transition line of noise - induced transitions .",
    "those studies motivated us to also analyze the effect of non gaussian noises on the behavior and transport properties of brownian motors @xcite .",
    "as is well known the study of noise induced transport by  ratchets \" has attracted in recent years the attention of an increasing number of researchers due to its biological interest and also to its potential technological applications @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that , under certain general conditions , non gaussian noise induces current and efficiency enhancement , without the need of a fine tuning of the parameters .",
    "also we have found the phenomenon of current inversion as the parameter @xmath0 ( associated to the non gaussian properties of the noise ) is varied .",
    "the analysis of the effects of a colored non gaussian noise source on the transport properties of a brownian motor was done by considering two alternative points of view : one which can be interpreted as more directly connected to technological applications and the other more related to biological or natural systems @xcite . in the model analyzed , these two visions correspond to consider as control parameters , different ( but related ) constants that are associated to correlation times and noise amplitudes . in this work",
    "we will focus on the second point of view , which considers the non gaussian noise as the primary or direct forcing of the brownian motor .",
    "in @xcite we have analyzed the system considering a long correlation time and a small amplitude of the stochastic forcing . in this contribution",
    "we extend the results found in @xcite by relaxing the condition of small amplitude of the noise . in this way we find new regimes , where the dynamics of the brownian motor is affected in different ways by the non gaussianity of the noise .",
    "we also delve deeper into the analytical study of the system in the adiabatic approximation ( which assumes a large correlation time of the forcing ) and we give a more complete understanding of some of the phenomena studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , we analyze the role played by the long tails of the distribution , and compare the results of truncated non gaussian distributions for different cutoff values but having the same width . in this way",
    "we show the crucial role played by those long tails in determining the enhancement of the brownian motor response .",
    "we consider the following model for a particle in a rocked ratchet , which is the same studied in ref . @xcite but considering the overdamped limit @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ratchet potential , @xmath6 is a constant `` load '' force , and @xmath7 the thermal noise satisfying @xmath8 . finally , @xmath9 is the time correlated forcing ( with zero mean ) that allows the rectification of the motion , keeping the system out of thermal equilibrium even for @xmath10 . for the ratchet potential",
    "we consider the same form as in @xcite and @xcite ( for instance , see fig . 3 in @xcite )",
    "@xmath11}{j_0(i\\alpha ) } - 1 \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the bessel function , and @xmath13 .",
    "we will consider the dynamics of @xmath9 as described by the following langevin equation @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath17.\\ ] ]    for @xmath18 , the process @xmath19 coincides with the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) one ( with a correlation time equal to @xmath20 ) , while for @xmath21 it is a non gaussian process .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the form of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) , for @xmath0 within the range @xmath22 , is @xmath23^\\frac{1}{1-q},\\ ] ] that for @xmath24 , extents along the interval @xmath25 , and decays as a power law ( slower than a gaussian distribution ) . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the sign inside the brackets is changed , and the pdf has a bounded support with a cut - off at @xmath27^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] .",
    "@xmath28 is a normalization constant . for @xmath29",
    "this distribution can not be normalized .",
    "the main characteristic introduced by this non gaussian form of the forcing is that , for @xmath30 , the distribution decays as a power law .",
    "this leads to the appearance of arbitrary strong `` kicks '' on the ratchet particle with relatively high probability when compared , for example , with the gaussian ou noise and , of course , with the dichotomic non gaussian process . for a picture of the typical form of this pdf for different values of @xmath0",
    ", we refer to fig . 1 in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the second moment of the distribution , which we interpret as the  intensity \" of the non gaussian noise , which is given by @xmath31 diverges for @xmath32 .",
    "for the correlation time @xmath33 of the process @xmath9 , defined in detail in @xcite it was not possible to find an analytical expression .",
    "however , it is known @xcite that for @xmath34 it diverges as @xmath35 . in our analysis , we will consider values of @xmath0 in the range @xmath36 .",
    "for this interval we have studied numerically the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath0 , and have found the following analytical approximation @xmath37 \\ , \\tau}{(5 - 3q)},\\ ] ] that fits very accurately the results .",
    "this fitting will be the one we will consider when analyzing the dependence of the transport properties of the ratchet system on the intrinsic parameters of the non gaussian noise , @xmath38 and @xmath33 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in @xcite we have studied the current and efficiency of the system as function of @xmath0 from two points of view .",
    "one corresponds to consider @xmath39 and @xmath20 as control parameters ( in addition to @xmath0 ) and the other is to consider @xmath38 and @xmath33 instead .",
    "the first point of view is the more direct one when thinking on tailor made technological devices @xcite .",
    "the second one is the more natural from the point of view of biological systems , as it consider @xmath19 as a primary source of noise characterized by its intensity and correlation time .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , in this work we focus on this second view .    considering the first point of view , in @xcite",
    "we have found that a departure from gaussian behavior ( particularly for @xmath30 ) , induces a remarkable increase of the current together with an enhancement of the motor efficiency .",
    "the efficiency shows in addition an optimum value for a given degree of departure from the gaussian behavior and decays due to the enhancement of fluctuations when the correlation of the non gaussian noise diverges .",
    "when inertia is taken into account we have also found a considerable increment in the mass separation capability of the system .",
    "the main results in @xcite corresponding to the second point of view will be discussed in the following sections in connection with the new results we will show . in the next section , we extend the analysis made in @xcite  which involves only relatively low intensities of the non gaussian noise  providing analytical results for a wide range of @xmath38 .",
    "different regions of this parameter are found where @xmath40 , the optimum value of @xmath0 that maximizes the current , changes from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "in the overdamped regime we are able to give an approximate analytical solution for the problem , which is valid in the large correlation time regime ( @xmath43 ) : we perform the adiabatic approximation of solving the fokker - planck equation associated to eq .",
    "( [ xpto ] ) assuming a constant value of @xmath19 @xcite , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this leads us to obtain an @xmath19dependent value of the current @xmath44 that is then averaged over @xmath19 using the distribution @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ pdfq ] ) @xcite with the desired values of @xmath0 , @xmath39 and @xmath20 @xmath46 we remark that , although the fokker - planck equation is solved in the @xmath47 limit , the solution we find depends on @xmath39 and @xmath20 through the @xmath45 distribution .",
    "note that , in order to perform the adiabatic approximation , it is essential to consider a non vanishing temperature , since this gives the random ingredient that leads to a fokker - planck equation . in fig .",
    "1 we show a typical curve for @xmath48 .     for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in both parts of the figure the same curve is plotted at different scales in order to better show the behavior . in part",
    "( b ) we have also shown the line to which @xmath48 converges for @xmath51.,width=340 ]    now we study the dependence of the current @xmath52 on the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the range @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "( for @xmath55 the current decays as a consequence of the  excess \" of noise , as is typical in most of the noise induced phenomena .",
    "hence , the behavior of the system for higher values of @xmath38 is not considered to be relevant . ) for the rest of the parameters we consider values similar to those in @xcite and @xcite where interesting transport phenomena have been observed .",
    "we fix @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the relevance of this parameter region was discussed in @xcite . as we show in the next section ,",
    "the value set for @xmath33 is high enough to make the adiabatic approximation valid .    in fig .",
    "2 we show results for the averaged current @xmath52 as function of @xmath38 for different values of @xmath0 . parts ( a ) and ( b ) of the figure show the same curves on different scales in order to better appreciate the crossings details .",
    "at a first glance , one may observe that for @xmath58 the current increases with @xmath0 , for @xmath59 the current decreases with @xmath0 , and finally , for @xmath60 the current increases with @xmath0 again .",
    "however , what actually occurs is a little more complicated .",
    "the results should be carefully read , as we are not showing the curves for all the possible values of @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "we have analyzed the behavior of the system in the region of small @xmath38 .",
    "it was shown that , for a fixed value of @xmath61 , there is an optimum value of @xmath30 , @xmath40 , that maximizes the current .",
    "what happens in fig .",
    "2a for very low values of @xmath38 is that @xmath40 is larger than the highest value plotted for @xmath0 .",
    "however , approximately at @xmath62 a crossing between the curves for @xmath63 and @xmath64 occurs .",
    "this means that the optimum value became lower than @xmath63 .     for different values of @xmath0 , calculated within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "both parts of the figure show the same curves in different ranges of @xmath38.,width=453 ]    now , considering that , as discussed in @xcite , the current should vanish for very low values of @xmath0 , since the bounds for the distribution of @xmath19 are reduced , and that for @xmath34 the current decreases due to the increasing of the fluctuations of @xmath19 , an optimum value of @xmath0 should always be expected . hence , the results in fig . 2 should be interpreted as follows . for every value of @xmath38",
    "there is an optimum value of @xmath65 that maximizes the current .",
    "for @xmath58 we have @xmath41 , for @xmath59 we have @xmath42 , and for @xmath66 we have again @xmath41 .    in the following section we present results from numerical simulations that validate these predictions of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we have analyzed numerically the evolution of eqs .",
    "( [ xpto ] ) and ( [ etapto ] ) by numerical integration of those equations using a second order stochastic runge  kutta type algorithm @xcite .",
    "the current is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the period of the ratchet potential , and @xmath69 indicates temporal averaging .    here , in order to appreciate the maxima predicted in the previous section , we present results for the current as function of @xmath0 for different values of @xmath38 .",
    "we have only considered values of @xmath70 , as higher values of this parameter requires considerable computational effort . in fig .",
    "3 we show the results coming from simulations together with the curves obtained analytically from the adiabatic theory . it can be seen that , for the value of @xmath33 considered , concerning the general behavior of the results as function of @xmath0 and @xmath38 there is a rather good agreement between theory and simulations . better accuracy from the adiabatic theory can only be obtained for larger values of the correlation time .    the results in fig 3 .",
    "confirm the predictions of the previous section ( at least for the values of @xmath71 here considered ) , as the optimum value of @xmath0 appears to be @xmath41 for @xmath58 and @xmath42 for @xmath72 .",
    "it should be mentioned that some of the results on this figure ( those for @xmath73 ) have been presented in @xcite .",
    "however , we want to remark that in that work we have only explored the region of low @xmath38 while now , we have a more panoramic view of the system s behavior as function of that parameter that ranges from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .     for fixed @xmath76 and different fixed values of @xmath38 .",
    "the lines with symbols corresponds to simulations and the lines without symbols to the adiabatic theory . from top to bottom , the curves are for @xmath77 ( solid line for theory and solid line with stars for simulations ) ; @xmath78 ( dashed line for theory and dashed line with hollow circles for simulations ) ; @xmath79 ( solid line for theory and solid line with triangles for simulations ) ; @xmath80 ( dashed line for theory and dashed line with crosses for simulations ) ; @xmath81 ( dotted line for theory and dotted line with squares for simulations ) ; and @xmath62 ( dash - dot - dot line for theory and dash - dot - dot line with solid circles for simulations ) .",
    "all calculations are for @xmath50 and @xmath49.,width=396 ]    finally , in order to analyze the relevance of the long tails of the non gaussian distributions for @xmath30 in determining the value of the current , we have done some special calculations .",
    "we have simulated the dynamics of the brownian motor forced by a different -but related- non gaussian noise . in eq .",
    "( [ xpto ] ) , instead of @xmath9 we consider the precess @xmath82 which is defined as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is @xmath85 if @xmath86 , and @xmath87 if @xmath88 . here , @xmath89 is a parameter that plays the role of a threshold for the non gaussian noise , and indicates the maximum value of the noise that can be `` feel '' by the particle . for @xmath90 the process @xmath91 converges to @xmath9 .",
    "note that , in practice , in the simulations we calculate the complete evolution for @xmath9 as in the normal case , but we change the way in which this noise couples to the brownian particle .    in fig.4.a",
    "we show results for the current as function of @xmath92 for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is apparent that the threshold @xmath92 needed to obtain the asymptotic value of the current ( corresponding to the one obtained with the process @xmath9 ) increases with @xmath0 .",
    "this means that the tails of the distribution are relevant up to higher values of @xmath19 as @xmath0 is increased . in fig .",
    "4.b we plot , as a function of @xmath0 , the value of the threshold @xmath93 at which the asymptotic value of the current is reached with an error lower than @xmath94 .     for different values of @xmath0 : solid line for @xmath95 , dashed line for @xmath96 , dotted line for @xmath97 , dash - dotted line for @xmath64 , and dash  dot  dotted line for @xmath63.,width=377 ]",
    "we have here further extended the study of the effect of non gaussian noises on the behavior and transport properties of brownian motors initiated in @xcite .",
    "we have focused on two aspects : ( a ) the adiabatic approximation ( valid for a high correlation time of the forcing ) @xcite , showing some analytical results for the current @xmath52 as a function of @xmath38 for different @xmath0 ; and ( b ) have analyzed the role played by the long tails of the distribution , by analyzing the results of truncated non gaussian distributions .    by means of the adiabatic approximation as well as related numerical simulations",
