    "among the known x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) that consist of an accreting neutron star ( ns ) or black hole primary , the ns binary 4u  1820@xmath030 in the globular cluster ngc  6624 is known as the most compact binary ( e.g. , @xcite ) : its orbital period @xmath4  s @xcite . considering this short period , the roche - lobe filling companion in the binary",
    "can be estimated to be a 0.060.08 @xmath1 , hydrogen - exhausted white dwarf ( wd ; @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray source shows a long - term modulation with a period of approximately 171 days @xcite , which was interpreted as an indication that this source is a hierarchical triple system @xcite . in this triple system model ,",
    "the ns - wd binary is the inner binary with orbital period @xmath5 s , and a second companion , orbiting the inner system with a period of @xmath6 day , induces an inner - binary eccentricity variation with the 171 day period .",
    "consequently , the mass accretion rate and x - ray luminosity of the x - ray source modulate with the same period .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the detection of a periodicity in 4u  1820@xmath030   from far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) observations , made with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "this fuv period is about 1% longer than the x - ray period , a difference that approximately fits the triple system model : one of the two periods , either the x - ray or fuv , is @xmath7 , while the other one is the beat period between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , since a very similar source , the xrb 4u  1916@xmath005 ( which has x - ray and optical periods of 50.00 min and 50.46 min , respectively ) , has been verified as a superhump source by the detection of negative superhumps in x - ray observations ( @xcite and reference therein ) , the slightly longer fuv period detected in 4u  1820@xmath030   could well be the indication of the binary also being a superhump source .",
    "additionally , a long term modulation ( 199  day ) in the x - ray light curve of 4u  1916@xmath005 had also been reported @xcite , although @xcite only found a likely 83 day modulation . due to the similarities between the two sources ,",
    "we thus suggest a superhump model for 4u  1820@xmath030 in this paper .",
    "superhumps are periodic modulations observed in interacting binary systems with periods a few percent longer than their orbital periods .",
    "this phenomenon was first discovered in the super - outbursts of the dwarf nova vw hyi @xcite , and since then , it has been commonly detected in short - period cataclysmic variables ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally believed that superhumps arise from an elliptical accretion disk , which is developed when the disk extends beyond the 3:1 resonance radius and precesses in the inertial frame due to the tidal force of a secondary star ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the resonance condition  the mass ratio of a secondary to a primary @xmath9appears to also work in x - ray binaries , as superhumps have been detected in both black hole soft x - ray transients ( sxts ; @xcite ) and ns xrbs 4u  1916@xmath0053 and gx  9 + 9 @xcite . indeed , haswell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have further suggested that ns low - mass xrbs with orbital periods below @xmath10 hr are potential superhump sources .",
    "previous ultraviolet ( uv ) observations of 4u  1820@xmath030 , made with the former _ hst _ instrument faint object spectrograph ( fos ) in rapid mode ( in a wavelength range of 12652510  ) , revealed a periodic modulation with a 16% amplitude @xcite .",
    "although the reported uv period , 687.6@xmath32.4  s , is consistent with the x - ray period , the accuracy of the timing result should have been hampered by several uncertainties on fos timing in rapid mode ( for details , see fos instrument science report cal / fos # 124 , # 150 ) .",
    "the _ hst _ observations were made on 1998 march 14 using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ; @xcite ) .",
    "a low - resolution grating g140l was used with the solar - blind csi multi - anode microchannel array ( stis / fuv - mama ) detector , providing an fuv wavelength coverage of 1150 - 1730    and a plate scale of 0.025/pixel along the spatial direction .",
    "the aperture used was a 52@xmath110.5  long slit .",
    "the data were taken in timetag mode , recording the detector position and arriving time of each detected photon .",
    "the timing resolution was 0.125 ms .",
    "we obtained the data from the _ hst _ archive service .",
    "the datasets consist of five exposures with a total exposure time of 12.1  ks : the first dataset had an exposure time of 1830  s , while the exposure time for each of the other four was 2580  s. the total time span was @xmath12 ks ( @xmath13 hrs ) .    using the iraf task odelaytime in the _ hst _ calibration package stis",
    ", we applied a barycenter correction to the measured arrival times .",
    "the _ hst _ ephemeris ( orx ) file at the observation time was obtained using the starview program . a box region with a 30-pixel ( = 075 ) width in the spatial direction , which well covered the target s spatial profile , was used for collecting the target s counts .",
    "we excluded the counts within the ly@xmath14 @xmath151216   line , for which the source was strong background emission @xcite .",
    "the resulting light curve of 4u  1820@xmath030  is shown in figure  1 .",
    "a modulation is clearly visible in the light curve .",
    "the contamination from the background was limited : in a nearby region with the same size to that of the target region , we found a background count rate of only 1.3 counts s@xmath16 ( compared to 3045 counts s@xmath16 in the target region ) .",
    "we first used an epoch - folding technique ( leahy et al .",
    "1983 ) to search for periodicity , with the data folded to 10 phase intervals per period .",
    "the resulting @xmath17 values are shown in figure  2 , clearly indicating the detection of a periodicity .",
    "the period is @xmath18 s , 5.3  s longer than the 685.0  s x - ray period .",
    "however , based on the epoch - folding technique , the frequency spacing was @xmath19 hz , corresponding to a temporal spacing of 9.6  s near 690  s. as a result , the spacing is not sufficient to determine the period difference between 690.3  s and 685.0  s.    to more accurately determine the period , we 10 times over - sampled our data and used a discrete fourier transform technique to construct an over - resolved power spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the original data were binned evenly in 1-s time intervals for the fourier transform . in figure  3 , the over - resolved power spectrum in the vicinity of the main power peak is shown .",
    "we fit the peak with a gaussian to obtain the peak frequency , and found @xmath20 mhz , corresponding to a period of @xmath2  s , where the standard 1@xmath21 uncertainties for signal frequency in an over - resolved power spectrum are given @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the period difference between the fuv and x - ray periods is significant ( approximately 6@xmath22 confidence ) .",
    "careful examination of the light curves in figure  [ fig : lc ] reveals that the strongest modulation peaks are asymmetric and non - sinusoidal in shape . as an additional check on our determination of the modulation period",
    ", we also used a phase - dispersion minimization technique @xcite .",
    "this technique works well for cases of non - sinusoidal variation contained in a few irregularly spaced observations .",
    "the resulting periodogram in the vicinity of the minimum @xmath23 statistic is shown in figure  [ fig : pdm ] .",
    "fitting the region near the minimum with a parabola @xcite , we found @xmath24 s. the period value , again deviating from 685.0  s , is consistent with that obtained from the fourier transform .    in order to quantify the overall periodic modulation in the light curve and",
    "thereby compare it with that obtained by @xcite , we binned the data in 10 s time intervals and obtained 1215 data points .",
    "the data points in each exposure interval were subtracted and normalized by the average , and then folded at the period of 693.5  s. the folded data points , shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : fold ] , are scattered in a relatively large range . for example , further binning the folded data points into 10 phase bins , the standard deviations of the bins were found to be between 5.98.4% .",
    "large scattering in optical light curves of xrbs is commonly seen ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for our case , we note that the modulation amplitude has significant variations in the data ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) . for example , in several regions , the modulation is barely visible .",
    "these amplitude variations smear the periodic modulation and cause large scattering in the folded light curve .",
    "following @xcite , we fitted a sinusoid to the 1215 data points , with the period fixed at 693.5 s. the best - fit has reduced @xmath25 for 1212 degrees of freedom , reflecting large scattering of the data points . from the best - fit , we found a semiamplitude of 6.3% .",
    "the time at the maximum of the sinusoidal fit ( phase zero ) was mjd 50886.015384@xmath30.000043 ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter .",
    "this semiamplitude we obtained is 2% lower than that in the uv range reported by @xcite .",
    "this difference could be due to the different wavelength coverages , because while the time spans of the uv and fuv data were approximately equal , the former covered a wavelength range twice as large as the latter . in addition , the uv observations were made in 1996 , two years earlier than the fuv observations . therefore the difference could also be due to intrinsic variations in uv emission from the source .",
    "the strong modulation peaks are asymmetric . here",
    "we folded 5 such peaks to show the asymmetry feature . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , the peaks that were used in folding are marked by arrows .",
    "the folded light curve is shown in the bottom panel of figure  5 .",
    "as can be seen , the light curve has a slow rise and a fast decline , with a semiamplitude of @xmath2610% .",
    "this asymmetric modulation is different from those sinusoidal or double - hump modulations that arise from companion stars and normally seen in xrbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rather , it resembles those modulations seen in superhump sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using different techniques in our timing analysis , we have discovered a period that is significantly different from the x - ray period .",
    "x - ray observations of 4u  1820@xmath030   by various x - ray observatories have consistently obtained the 685.0  s period over the past two decades ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , demonstrating the stableness of the x - ray period .",
    "also even though an x - ray period derivative @xmath27 has been detected @xcite , its negative value , @xmath28 @xmath0(25)@xmath29 yr@xmath16 , not only implies a decrease of the period as a function of time , but also is too small ( @xmath300.035 ms yr@xmath16 ) to account for any period changes comparable to the 8.5  s difference between the x - ray and fuv periods . as stis",
    "may be repaired in the future , our result could be confirmed by further observations .",
    "we would use a phase - coherent timing technique to build a long time span from several short observations , thus allowing a very accurate determination of the fuv period ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the discovered period could be additional evidence for the triple system model , which has been suggested for 4u  1820@xmath030   ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the source is located near the center of the globular cluster @xcite , the existence of triple systems is expected due to binary - binary interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , one triple system , known as psr b1620@xmath026 , has been found in the globular cluster m4 , although this source may not represent a prototypic triple system in a globular cluster @xcite . the second companion around the system s inner ns - wd binary is a jovian planet @xcite .",
    "however , given the similarities between the xrbs 4u 1820@xmath030 and 4u 1916@xmath0053 , it is likely that 4u 1820@xmath030 is a superhump source with the x - ray and fuv periods being @xmath31 and the superhump period @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "since the orbital periodicity is indicated by dips in the x - ray light curve of the source , this xrb probably has an inclination angle of @xmath3360   @xcite . with this angle",
    ", the uv modulation that is caused by x - ray irradiation of the companion star has been estimated to be at the 5% level of the persistent emission from the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the superhump modulation , presumably reflecting the area changes of the x - ray irradiated accretion disk , could be comparable but slightly stronger @xcite .",
    "therefore the fuv modulation we detected could arise from both the companion and disk , but with the latter slightly dominant over the former .",
    "this might explain large scattering seen in the folded light curve .",
    "in addition , the strong modulation peaks in the light curve appears to be asymmetric , resembling those seen in superhump sources .",
    "this asymmetry feature in the modulation provides additional support to our suggestion that 4u  1820@xmath030  is a superhump source .",
    "the origin of the long - term 171 day variation is not clear . simply by comparison",
    ", it would be the so - called  superorbital \" modulation since long - term periodicities have been seen in a few other xrbs . this type of modulations has been suggested to be caused by the nodal precession of a warped disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , critical questions remain to be answered for the warping disk scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the superhump model",
    ", the superhump excess is defined as @xmath34 . for 4u  1820@xmath030",
    ", we obtain @xmath35 , similar to those values found for 4u  1916@xmath0053 ( @xcite ) and sxts @xcite .",
    "based on a relation between the superhump excess and mass ratio @xmath36 @xcite , @xmath37 , it can be found that @xmath38 for 4u  1820@xmath030 , implying a companion mass of about @xmath39 ( a @xmath40 standard neutron star mass is assumed ) .",
    "this mass value is consistent with the mass range estimated for 4u  1820@xmath030   in a standard scenario ( i.e. , the mass transfer in the binary system is driven by gravitational radiation ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath41@xmath36 relation could be used to set a constraint on the mass of a neutron star if the mass of a companion could be estimated from other measurements .",
    "currently , three distinct binary evolution channels are thought to form ultracompact binaries ( whose orbital periods are less than @xmath2680 min ; for ultracompact binary formation and evolution , see @xcite and references therein ) . assuming the wd channel for the formation of 4u  1820@xmath030 , the helium wd in this xrb would likely have a mass of 0.060.1 @xmath1 at the present time , having evolved from an initial mass of 0.10.3 @xmath1 at the beginning of the xrb phase ( @xcite ; deloye 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "the @xmath36 value estimated from the superhump period suggests that the accreting neutron star in 4u  1820@xmath030  has a mass value not much larger than @xmath42 , the canonical neutron star mass .",
    "the observed negative @xmath27 has been a puzzling feature in 4u  1820@xmath030   @xcite , since in the standard scenario , a positive @xmath27 for 4u 1820@xmath030 is expected @xcite .",
    "the negative value could be caused by the gravitational acceleration of the globular cluster @xcite .",
    "alternatively as suggested by @xcite , the period changes could be caused by azimuthal variations of the impact point in the accretion disk ( at which the gas flow from the companion star impinges on the disk ) , and the azimuthal variations could be induced by the precession of an elliptical accretion disk . as a result , the phase of the observed x - ray light curve would be shifted and thus there might not be any changes for the true orbital period ( however , see @xcite for arguments against this scenario ) .",
    "our identification of 4u  1820@xmath030  as a superhump source may provide a support to this scenario , since the accretion disk in a superhump source is expected to be elliptical .    in order to confirm whether 4u 1820@xmath030 is a superhump system , critical evidence such as the detection of negative superhumps",
    "is required @xcite . according to the empirical relation among the periods of the negative and positive superhump and orbit given by @xcite",
    ", the negative superhump period should be @xmath33678 s. we may also search for a beat period between the x - ray and fuv / optical periods from 4u  1820@xmath030 , since such a period was found from the x - ray light curve of 4u  1916@xmath005 ( 3.90 days ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this beat period indicates that an accretion disk precesses with a period @xmath43 . for 4u  1820@xmath030",
    ", we estimate @xmath44 day .",
    "however , because the x - ray timing observations of 4u  1820@xmath030  were mainly made with _",
    "rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) , searches for such a period are difficult because of @xmath331 day observation gaps of _ rxte _ data .",
    "we note that our fuv observations were made near the bottom flux of the 171 day periodic modulation . in the superhump scenario , both the superhump and superorbital modulations are supposed to arise from the accretion disk in 4u 1820@xmath030 . a detection of any correlations between these two modulations , such as variations of the superhump period and light curve as a function of superorbital phase @xcite , would verify the disk origin of the modulation and thus support that 4u 1820@xmath030 is a superhump source .",
