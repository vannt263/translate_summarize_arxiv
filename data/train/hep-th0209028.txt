    "we have done our calculations in a severe truncation of the representation space .",
    "such a truncation violates covariance , but if the contribution of excluded fock sectors is sufficiently small , the consequence of the truncation is more a question of accuracy than of preserving symmetries : if we are close to the hypothetical solution mentioned above , it does not matter if this ( small ) error violates symmetries .",
    "the reason we have used such a severe truncation is that it allows us to find solutions and take limits in closed form , and thus our interpretation of the results is not confounded by questions of inaccuracies introduced by numerical solutions .",
    "a significant feature of the calculations , which came as a surprise to us , is that the results depend strongly on the way in which the two pv masses are allowed to approach infinity .",
    "it is not true that any two different trajectories will give different results but rather that there are families of trajectories which give the same results .",
    "for instance , any trajectory on which the two pv masses are proportional to each other , with a fixed constant of proportionality , give the same result as taking the limit with the two masses set equal to each other .",
    "similarly , any path on which @xmath45 is logarithmically small compared with @xmath46 will give the same result as taking the limit @xmath87 first , then taking the limit @xmath123 .",
    "one possibility is that all these trajectories represent different phases of the theory .",
    "another possibility is that the effect is an artifact of the truncation , and , if we include more and more of the representation space in the calculations , the results of the various ways of taking the limit will approach each other .",
    "another possibility that we have considered is that some of the ways of taking the limit are wrong and that some principle which we have not yet discerned will determine the correct way to take the limit .",
    "we hope to report further studies on this question in the future .    in the calculations we have given special consideration to the discrete chiral symmetry that is formally present in the unregulated lagrangian .",
    "writing the interaction as a product of zero - norm fields breaks the chiral symmetry explicitly ( unless the mass of the pv fermion is taken to be zero ) , and we have been careful to notice whether or not it is restored in the large - pv - mass limit , at least in the sense that the physical mass of the fermion is proportional to the bare mass .",
    "we find that for some ways of taking the limit the discrete chiral symmetry is restored and for some ways it is not .",
    "we do not know whether this consideration can provide a valid way of choosing one limiting procedure over another .",
    "this question is important because , not only is chiral symmetry of interest in itself , but the way it is broken by the regulation procedure is analogous to the way gauge symmetry is broken by writing the interactions of gauge theories as products of zero - norm fields .",
    "we have argued that our results suggest that if calculations are done in a truncated representation space , it may not be correct to take the limit of the pv masses going all the way to infinity .",
    "it is easy to understand the reason why : if we are to have accurate calculations , most of the support of the wave functions in which we are interested must lie in the part of the space we retain .",
    "we know from past studies that the projection of the low - lying states onto the higher fock sectors often falls off very rapidly in the light - cone representation , but those results were for finite values of the regulators . at infinite values of the regulators ,",
    "the eigenvectors are not expected to exist at all , and we must expect that as the regulators are removed the projection of the wave functions onto any allowed sectors will become large",
    ". thus it will be necessary to keep the pv masses finite when one truncates the representation space .",
    "if there are values of the pv masses sufficiently large to remove most of the bad effects of the negative - norm states on the eigenvectors in which we are interested , but small enough to make small the projection of these eigenvectors onto sectors we can not manage to keep , then we can do a useful calculation ; otherwise not .",
