    "the study of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) in our galaxy is plagued by the same problem that afflicts so many other areas of astrophysics : uncertainty in the distances to , and hence luminosities of the objects being studied . a second and",
    "no less severe problem is the space density and spatial distribution uncertainties caused by our parochial view of the milky way .",
    "while we can detect erupting galactic classical novae several kpc from the sun , most other cvs are located closer than about 500 pc .",
    "the reason is simple : novae often achieve @xmath1 @xmath2 , rivaling the most luminous objects in our galaxy for weeks at a time , while dwarf novae ( dn ) , nova - like variables and their magnetic cousins rarely exceed 10 @xmath2 .",
    "astronomers have succeeded in cataloguing barely a thousand galactic cvs in over a century of searching . only for a handful",
    "are ironclad distances published from hubble space telescope parallaxes @xcite .",
    "expansion parallaxes for classical novae contribute another 20 or so reasonably secure distances and luminosities ( see @xcite for a summary ) .",
    "it would clearly be of enormous benefit to cv science if hundreds or thousands of cataclysmic variables , all at the same distance , could be located .",
    "accurate luminosity functions , and bias - free period distributions and eruption frequencies would become available to confront inadequately - constrained theoretical models .",
    "new sub - classes of cvs might be discovered , and systematic variations in outburst properties and binary orbital distributions would likely be uncovered .",
    "the situation is improving for cvs in a few special places : the crowded cores of globular clusters .",
    "recent detections of dozens of cv candidates in 47 tuc @xcite , allow , for the first time , the comparative study of many cataclysmics , _ all at the same distance_. unfortunately , hst and chandra are essential for followup studies , and these telescopes are two of the rarest commodities in astrophysics .",
    "it may be decades before the newly discovered cvs are fully characterized .",
    "worse , many of these cvs probably formed by tidal captures and/or evolved violently under the influences of passing stars .",
    "only one globular dn is easily resolved and studied from the ground : v101 in m5 @xcite .",
    "its rather long ( 5.79 hour ) period @xcite warns us that it may be anomalous .",
    "cvs in the cores of globular clusters have much to teach us , but they re likely to be very different from field cvs .",
    "the outlook is potentially more promising in the magellanic clouds . as in the case of globular clusters",
    ", all cvs discovered in the clouds are at nearly the same distance , so direct luminosity comparisons are meaningful .",
    "spatial densities of field lmc and smc stars are roughly comparable to those in the neighborhood of the sun , rather than those typical of globular cluster cores , so tidal encounters almost never happen .",
    "cvs in the clouds must form and evolve via ordinary binary evolution , just as in the field in our own galaxy .",
    "it is certainly true that the metallicities of the red dwarf companions to the white dwarfs in magellanic cvs will usually be lower than those in the galaxy .",
    "lower metallicity is a much less drastic effect @xcite than dynamical interactions @xcite in globular clusters , so direct comparisons between galactic and magellanic cvs should be extremely fruitful .",
    "finally , the clouds must be home to @xmath3 or more cvs ( see below ) , an enormous sample likely to contain every subtype of cv we know , and perhaps some that we do nt yet recognize .    before carrying out galaxy - lmc population comparisons , we must , of course find cvs in the clouds . since 1897",
    "about 35 erupting classical novae have been spotted in the lmc and smc .",
    "accurate ( 1 - 2 arcsecond ) positions for most of these , and recovery of some in deep @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 images has recently occurred @xcite .",
    "the current sample of quiescent cloud novae is important to follow - up , but will grow in number only very slowly .",
    "this is because all classical novae must recur @xcite with inter - eruption times of at least @xmath7 yr .",
    "thus the many thousands of classical novae that exist in the clouds will only slowly reveal themselves , via eruptions , over many millennia .    as dwarf novae",
    "are a substantial sub - population of cvs which reveal themselves through outbursts every few weeks to months , _ almost all _ dn in any given field should be identifiable , at least in principle , in a deep survey of order 6 - 12 months in length .",
    "luminous erupting dn should achieve @xmath8 , @xmath9 near maximum ( see section 6 ) and thus be detectable except in the most crowded lmc fields .",
    "surveying the entire lmc and smc often enough to find nearly all erupting dn is a daunting observational program that can and will eventually be undertaken . in this paper",
    "we report a much more modest but realistic feasibility study to demonstrate , for the first time , the existence of erupting dn in the lmc .",
    "we also derive a crude estimate of the total number of luminous dn in the lmc .    in section 2 we present the observational strategy and database , while the photometry calibrations are described in section 3 .",
    "completeness tests are detailed in section 4 , and the six erupting dn candidates are shown in section 5 .",
    "simulations of erupting dn in the lmc are compared to these candidates in section 6 .",
    "we discuss whether the candidates could be other kinds of variables , and the implications for cv numbers and space densities if the candidates are true dn in section 7 .",
    "we briefly summarize our results in section 8 .",
    "to maximize our chances of detecting erupting lmc dn we requested the longest dark run with the largest telescope ( the 4-m)and widest field imager ( mosaic2 8k @xmath0 8k ) available in 1999 at ctio .",
    "we were awarded the dark nights of 1999 december 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 .",
    "all nights were clear , with seeing mostly in the range @xmath10 arcsec . because dn are usually remarkably blue ( @xmath11 is a good rule - of - thumb ; though much redder values do occur @xcite ) we opted to image our chosen lmc field in @xmath4 and @xmath6 filters .",
    "three to eight images were obtained each night in each filter , with total exposure times ( typically ) of 2.5 hours in @xmath4 and 1 hour in @xmath6 .",
    "a detailed log is given in table 1 .",
    "the plate scale was 0.270 arcsec / pixel , and our total field of view was 1362 arcmin@xmath12 = 0.38 deg@xmath12 .",
    "the lmc field we chose is centered at ra ( j2000 ) 05:33:36.7 and dec ( j2000 ) -70:33:44 .",
    "the field of view was chosen because five erupting classical novae ( the novae of 1948 , 1970a , 1970b , 1981 and 1988a ) have been observed in the area covered by our ccd array . . .",
    "more than any other location in or near the lmc .",
    "we were thus able to monitor these five old novae `` for free '' while searching for erupting dwarf novae .",
    "the results of the old nova monitoring will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "an overall view of the location of this field within the lmc is shown in figure 1 , with a magnified view of the eight ccd fields superposed .",
    "the field is at the southeastern end of the lmc bar , and crowding is significant . the large surface density of stars hampered efforts to detect faint dn , but was critical to maximize the chances of detecting at least a few bright erupting dn .",
    "the individual mosaic2 @xmath13 images were combined using the `` montage2 '' routine contained within the stand - alone daophot package . on a given night , individual frames were taken with a total vertical dither of @xmath14 pixels .",
    "these frames were run through daophot s matching program `` daomaster '' to derive the subpixel frame - to - frame shifts .",
    "these shifts were passed to montage2 , which produced a sky subtracted median image of the individual frames .",
    "the calibrations were derived from a set of standard magnitudes taken from the central region of m67 as given in @xcite . to ensure that the central region of m67 was observed on all eight chips ,",
    "the cluster was observed over two nights on the `` right hand '' side of the array and then later on the `` left hand '' side .",
    "however , the `` left hand '' side was observed on the fifth night , and was therefore unusable due to poor seeing .",
    "nevertheless , the zero - points between chips were consistent to within .05 magnitudes , and the zero - points derived for the `` right hand '' side were used for the entire data set .    due to the variable seeing",
    ", there also exist very subtle differences in the photometry on a night - to - night basis .",
    "thus , in addition to the global zero - point calibration uncertainty described above , there also exist night - to - night zero - point corrections on the order of .05-.1 mag .",
    "these corrections were found by first searching for the least variable ( most constant ) stars that returned valid photometry for all of the six nights .",
    "this was done in an iterative manner to locate stars with variability at least three times less than the average of the ensemble .",
    "once this goal was achieved , a night - to - night average was calculated , and this was subtracted from the photometry of the returned candidates .",
    "none of these rather small uncertainties has any effect on the candidate detections and conclusions of this paper .",
    "accurate photometry and astrometry of any source is limited not only by the source s brightness , but also by the degree of crowding in the field",
    ". simulations were performed to determine the efficiency of recovery of a collection of synthetic stars within a representative sub - region of the dataset as a function of brightness .",
    "these simulations use the actual point spread function for a given night and filter , yielding a measure of the effective plate limit and the overall detection sensitivity of these observations and data reductions .",
    "first , the same small sub - region of the entire field was chosen in both the @xmath4 and @xmath6 bands and from each of the six nights .",
    "the stars in this 500 @xmath0 500 pixel sub - image showed crowding typical of the rest of the dataset ( @xmath15 4000 stars in the sub - image ) . moreover ,",
    "the star brightness range in the overall dataset was well matched by the range in this sub - image .",
    "next , in order to generate a set of synthetic stars , the `` addstar '' routine contained within daophot was used to place 100 copies of the point - spread function randomly across an image and at a set brightness .",
    "this was repeated 10 times , for a total of 1000 synthetic stars at a given brightness , night , and filter .",
    "then `` allstar '' returned photometry on all the stars from these 10 runs .",
    "the fraction of the input synthetic stars that were recovered gives the level of completeness for that given brightness .",
    "a synthetic star was considered `` recovered '' if it was measured within @xmath16 magnitudes of its input value .",
    "the entire procedure was then repeated with a different brightness for the input synthetic stars . a total magnitude range of @xmath17 for both the @xmath4 and @xmath6 filters was covered in increments of 0.25 magnitudes each .",
    "the results are shown in figures 2a and 2b .",
    "each of the completeness curves reflect well the seeing of each night .",
    "for example , the completeness for the third night ( best seeing ) is 70% at @xmath18 , and 40% at @xmath19 , typical of an lmc dn near eruption maximum . on the fifth night ( the worst seeing night ) the completeness at these same magnitudes is barely 2 - 3% .",
    "fortunately every night s imagery except that of night 5 was deep enough and complete enough for us to expect to see at least @xmath20 of all erupting dn at or near peak brightness .",
    "for a field with such a high stellar density ( @xmath21 stars / arcmin@xmath12 ) , the construction of a good point spread funtion ( psf ) is hampered most by neighboring stars crowding the psf stars .",
    "much effort was expended to automate the search for variables entirely , comparing lists of psf photometry stars on successive nights . night - to - night seeing",
    "changes produced many candidates in the automated search that were rejected upon visual inspection .",
    "rejection of a candidate invariably occurred because the `` candidate '' revealed itself to be an artifact created by overlapping psfs of several stars , changing with the seeing from night to night .",
    "the dwarf - nova candidates were ultimately found by blinking rapidly through the best four of the six nightly frames to look for any subtle changes in the appearance of the stellar field .",
    "dwarf novae should rise from invisibility to easily detectable in the 48 hours between observations . to look for changes on a fairly detailed level ,",
    "each chip was visually divided into 32 sub - regions , and blinked rapidly . brightening from previously empty regions of the sky",
    "is easily seen . a star that is ramping up or down in brightness by @xmath22 mags",
    "can also be easily detected since the transition between the first and last night is very prominent .",
    "artificial dwarf novae placed in the frames were visually detected with efficiencies similar to the completeness curves of figure 2 .    to be recognized as a candidate , a variable had to be visible in both the @xmath4 and @xmath6 medianed frames of at least one of the six nights , and to have varied by over one magnitude in both filters between any two nights .",
    "this selection method initially revealed 14 dwarf nova candidates from the entire dataset .",
    "a second criterion was then applied to weed out short - period , large amplitude variables : no candidate could vary significantly ( more than about 1.0 magnitudes ) from frame to frame during any one night .",
    "it is certainly true that the light output of many cvs `` flickers '' on timescales of seconds to hours , and that some cvs undergo short , deep eclipses .",
    "we nevertheless adopted this conservative approach to eliminate non - cv , short - period eclipsing binaries .",
    "inspection of each night s individual images confirmed that 7 candidates were likely eclipsing binaries , and one candidate was so crowded that we can not say for sure that it is a real variable .",
    "the eclipsing variables may be useful for lmc distance determinations or other projects , and so we supply their finder charts , and coordinates in figure 8 and table 3 , respectively .",
    "we are thus left with six good candidate erupting dn .",
    "we define a good candidate as one that is seen in both @xmath4 and @xmath6 on at least one night ; on all images in each filter of that night ; and whose variability characteristics are consistent with those of at least one well - studied galactic dwarf nova ( see next section ) .",
    "the nightly images of the six dn candidates are shown in figure 3 , and their photometry is presented in figure 4 .",
    "the poisson error is the dominant photometric error in these plots , although readnoise and sky noise also have been incorporated into the error bars shown .",
    "we defer a discussion of these candidates and their implications until after the next section , where we simulate expected dn images and light curves .",
    "to complement the completeness tests described in section 4 , simulations of eruptions of several well known and characterized galactic dwarf novae , artificially placed in the actual lmc data , were needed .",
    "eruptions of ss cyg , u gem , ss aur , ar and , and em cyg were all simulated in a relatively uncrowded but otherwise representative patch of the lmc field ( an uncrowded field was chosen to highlight the photometric appearances of lmc dn , unhindered by the crowding or incompleteness addressed in figure 2 ) .",
    "the images from these simulations are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the three dwarf novae ss cyg , u gem and ss aur have accurately determined parallaxes @xcite and , using their well tabulated apparent magnitudes @xcite , the absolute magnitudes are easily calculated .",
    "the absolute magnitudes for ar and and em cygni were obtained from @xcite .",
    "these five objects were chosen to cover the range of absolute magnitudes seen for erupting and quiescent dn .",
    "our simulated dwarf novae all reflect the rise , plateau , and decline times from @xcite , start at quiescence on the first night of observations and attain maximum brightness on the second observing night ( 48 hours later ) , have all been placed at the distance of the lmc and , with one exception noted below , use mean @xmath23 colors from @xcite .",
    "we have assumed that the lmc dn are dimmed by @xmath24 = 0.3 and @xmath25 = 0.5 , in accord with @xcite .",
    "psf photometry was performed on these frames ; the resulting light curves and retrieved photometry are shown in figure 6 .",
    "an additional simulated ss cygni eruption sequence ( labeled `` ss cyg sequence 2 '' in figure 6 ) incorporated more detailed information about this object s color evolution with time . during its eruption , ss cygni becomes distinctly more red , reaching @xmath26 before attaining maximum brightness @xcite .",
    "this second ss cyg sequence utilizes these colors , and has been shifted by one day in phase .",
    "that is , the first simulated observation of this second sequence catches the dwarf nova on the rise .",
    "( `` ss cygni sequence 1 '' shows the artificial dn in quiescence on the first night ) .",
    "this second ss cyg sequence was included because it mimics rather well the overall observed light curves of dn candidates shz1 , shz4 and shz6 , though the latter two objects are still redder than the simulated dn .",
    "we regard this difference as minor because reddening does vary strongly , and on small spatial scales , across the lmc @xcite .",
    "it is clear from figure 5 that we are unlikely to have been able to detect erupting dn like u gem , ss aur , ar and or em cyg  all are too intrinsically faint to be detected , in our crowded fields",
    ". if our candidates are really dn they are much more likely to be ss cygni , or possibly su uma - type cvs in superoutburst .",
    "comparison of the six candidates shown in figure 3 with the lmc - dn simulation images shown in figure 5 ( particularly `` ss cyg sequence 2 '' and `` su uma superoutburst '' ) demonstrates that the brightness and variability behaviors of our candidates are broadly consistent with those expected of luminous erupting dwarf novae in the lmc .",
    "this is further supported by comparison of the measured and simulated light curves of figures 4 and 6 , respectively .",
    "however , it is by no means certain that all or even some of the six variables shown in figure 3 are really lmc erupting dwarf novae .",
    "what are the other possible variables that might mimic lmc dn behavior ?",
    "amongst these are : chance superpositions of background supernovae or classical novae , gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , microlensing events , milky way variables along the line of sight to the lmc , and non - cv lmc variables .",
    "the microlensing hypothesis can immediately be discarded because of the non - grey light curve behaviors , non - symmetric shapes of the light curves and ( in most cases ) overly long time at maximum light .",
    "grb afterglows typically achieve r or i @xmath27 one day after outburst .",
    "while the peak brightness of these variables is in accord with the grb hypothesis , we can eliminate this possibility because none of the candidates declines quickly enough to be a grb .",
    "large area , multi - epoch surveys for faint variables ( e.g. @xcite ) show that the surface density of our variables is far too high for them to be field rr lyraes , classical novae or supernovae .    the brightness and moderately blue colors of the candidates",
    "rule out other types of galactic variables .",
    "rr lyraes in the galaxy or lmc would be considerably brighter , and flare stars do nt match the observed nightly brightness profiles and/or blue colors .",
    "a final possibility to consider is that some of our candidates might be galactic or lmc eclipsing binaries .",
    "galactic binaries would have to be rather low luminosity systems ( say @xmath28 ) and thus much redder than observed to appear at @xmath29 .",
    "eclipsing lmc systems would range in luminosity from @xmath30 ( shz6 ) to @xmath31 ( shz3 and shz5 ) , corresponding to a - type main sequence stars .",
    "the amplitudes of light variation in shz1 , shz3 , shz4 , shz5 and shz6 are greater than 0.7 magnitude and thus preclude equal mass ( and brightness ) binaries , but a hot pre - white dwarf + a cooler companion star could mimic the observed light curves for shz1 , shz5 and shz6 .",
    "as noted earlier , we see no sign of significant variability for any of the six candidates on the individual frames taken during the two to five hours of observations during each of the six nights of the run .",
    "the candidates light curves support their tentative identifications as dn , though some may turn out to be other kinds of variables",
    ".    to be absolutely certain of these objects identities will require challenging follow - up observations .",
    "four possible confirmation techniques are the following :    \\1 ) spectra near quiescence ( to demonstrate the presence of balmer emission lines ) would be definitive proof , but the dn are then expected to be near 25th magnitude ... beyond the likely capability of even an 8 meter telescope in such crowded fields .",
    "\\2 ) imagery every night or two for several months with a 4 meter class telescope should reveal repeated eruptions separated by weeks to months .",
    "such a program would also distinguish erupting cvs from lmc eclipsing binaries , where the emergence of a hot , blue star from eclipse  seen only at one epoch  can be confused with a genuine dn eruption .",
    "this can be done , but will be very demanding of large telescope time .",
    "\\3 ) ultraviolet imagery of the fields of the six candidate dwarf novae with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) might reveal uv - bright objects , as the spectral energy distributions of most cvs rise sharply into the uv .",
    "4 ) several hours of time - resolved uv or optical photometry , again with hst , might reveal the flickering and/or orbital modulation characteristic of cvs .",
    "space density estimates of cvs near the sun suggest @xmath32stars@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "space density estimates of all types of stars in the solar neighborhood yield @xmath34stars@xmath33 , suggesting that about 1 cv exists in the galaxy - and probably in the lmc - for every @xmath7 stars .",
    "the lmc displays a v - band luminosity of -18.1 , corresponding to a mass of @xmath35 @xmath36 @xcite and a population of a few times @xmath35 stars .",
    "if the galaxy and lmc manufacture cvs with similar efficiencies and rates then we estimate a total lmc cv population today of a few times @xmath3 objects .",
    "about half of known cvs are dn @xcite which suggests a total lmc dn population of order @xmath3 .",
    "these dn are spread across the 10 @xmath0 10 degree surface of the lmc .",
    "erupting classical novae are observed to be distributed quite uniformly across the face of the lmc @xcite , consistent with them belonging to an old population .",
    "a surface density of 10,000 dn per square degree across the lmc is thus expected .",
    "the size of our field of view was 1362 arcmin@xmath37 = 0.38 deg@xmath37 , which should include 0.38 @xmath0 10,000 = 3,800 dn .",
    "the average time between eruptions for 21 well studied galactic dn is 29 days @xcite .",
    "the length of our observing run ( 11 nights ) suggests that any dn erupting on the nine nights between nights 2 and 10 , inclusive , could have been detected ( if it became sufficiently luminous ) .",
    "hence ( 9/29 ) @xmath0 3800 @xmath15 1200 dn eruptions should have occurred in our field of view that were ( at least in principle ) detectable .    the 4 meter telescope seeing varied significantly over the six nights on which we observed , as clearly seen in the completeness curves of figure 2 . only on the second ,",
    "third and sixth nights were conditions good enough to allow straightforward detection ( with 20% to 40% completeness due to crowding ) of dn reaching @xmath38 . assuming ( conservatively ) that we missed half of all dn because only 3 of 6 observing nights were `` good '' , and that we missed 80% of all eruptions even on the three `` good '' nights because of crowding",
    ", we might still have expected to have detected @xmath39 erupting dn .",
    "the apparent brightness of a dwarf nova depends both on the underlying binary system inclination and orbital period .",
    "nearly face - on disks and longer orbital periods ( which have larger and brighter disks ) will dominate a magnitude limited sample @xcite .",
    "high inclination systems will be up to 2 magnitudes fainter than those seen nearly face - on , and will therefore be lost in a sample that is detecting only the brightest tip of the distribution .",
    "longer period systems will have larger and brighter disks , and thus might be expected to dominate our sample .",
    "however , the number of short - period dn ( @xmath40 hr ) is twice the number of long - period systems ( @xmath41 hr ) , and it is these short - period systems that undergo su uma - like superoutbursts .",
    "su uma superoutbursts typically last @xmath42 weeks , and system brightnesses might match those observed for our six candidates .",
    "this will be clearer when parallaxes are available for at least a few su uma cvs .",
    "the fact that we detected at most six dn when ( an admittedly simple ) model predicts 120 suggests that many erupting systems were too faint to be detected .",
    "this is in accord with the model light curves of figure 6 , and reinforced by the simulated images of figure 5 showing that dn like u gem , ss aur and em cyg would all have been missed in our survey , and even ( relatively luminous ) ar and would have been possible but challenging to detect .",
    "what fraction of dn are at least as luminous as ss cyg or su uma at maximum ?",
    "unfortunately , the answer is unknown , because the distances to all but four galactic dn are too uncertain to yield a believable luminosity distribution .",
    "( we note that the canonical literature distance to the prototypical dn , ss cyg , was in error by a factor of two until hst parallaxes became available in 2000 ) .",
    "if our six candidates are all bona fide erupting dn in the lmc ( of either ss cygni or su uma type ) this suggests that 95% of all dn are less luminous than these prototypical dwarf novae .",
    "this percentage rises if fewer than six of our candidates are really dn .",
    "we have carried out an 11 day - long survey for erupting dwarf novae in the large magellanic cloud , during which we imaged 0.38 deg@xmath37 in @xmath4 and @xmath6 filters on alternate nights .",
    "artificial dn and completeness tests confirm that we imaged faint enough ( to 23rd mag on the better nights ) to detect ss cygni - like eruptions .",
    "six candidates were isolated from approximately a million stars observed with the ctio 8k @xmath0 8k mosaic2 ccd imager .",
    "if these are true lmc dn , then they are amongst the most luminous of outbursting dwarf novae in the clouds ; ss cygni - like outbursts or possibly su uma - like superoutbursts .",
    "we estimate the total lmc dn population as @xmath43 , and the lmc surface density as @xmath44 dn / deg@xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that at least 95% of erupting lmc dn are fainter than the six candidates we present , and were thus missed .",
    "an extra magnitude in sensitivity and improvements in spatial resolution will likely lead to the discovery of thousands of dn in the magellanic clouds .",
    "we are indebted to the cerro tololo observatory directors robert williams and malcolm smith for the generous allocation of observing time for this project .",
    "we also thank tony moffat , darragh o donohue , brian warner and an anonymous referee for valuable comments .    while the time coverage we have of the seven variables noted in section 5 is far too sparse for any attempt at period determination",
