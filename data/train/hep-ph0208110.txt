    "previous calculations of the widths for e1 transitions in heavy quarkonia  @xcite have acheived qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "however , the situation concerning the m1 transitions has remained unsatisfactory for a long time  @xcite as the width for @xmath11 has typically been overpredicted by a factor of  @xmath15 .",
    "calculations of m1 widths using the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation  @xcite have demonstrated that the m1 transitions in charmonium are sensitive both to the relativistic aspects of the spin - flip operator as well as the lorentz structure of the @xmath4 interaction .",

    "<S> the electromagnetic e1 and m1 transitions in heavy quarkonia  ( @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 ) and the magnetic moment of the @xmath3 are calculated within the framework of the covariant blankenbecler - sugar ( bslt ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to study the effects of two - quark exchange current operators which involve the @xmath4 interaction , that arise in the bslt ( or schrdinger ) reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation . </S>",
    "<S> these are found to be small for e1 dominated transitions such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , but significant for the m1 dominated ones . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a satisfactory description of the empirical data on e1 and m1 transitions in charmonium and bottomonium requires unapproximated treatment of the dirac currents of the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is demonstrated that many of the transitions are sensitive to the form of the @xmath4 wavefunctions , and thus require a realistic treatment of the large hyperfine splittings in the heavy quarkonium systems . </S>"
