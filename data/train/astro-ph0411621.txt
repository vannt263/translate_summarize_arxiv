    "abundance determinations of stars in galactic globular clusters can provide valuable information about important astrophysical processes such as stellar evolution , stellar structure , galactic chemical evolution and the formation of the milky way . with the advent of efficient high resolution spectrographs on 8 - 10 m telescopes , it is now possible to reach at least the luminous rgb stars in even the most distant galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) . in our previous work in this area",
    "we have explored the abundances for large samples of stars in the canonical relatively nearby gcs m71 @xcite , m5 @xcite m3 , and m13 @xcite , as well as in pal  12 @xcite , a cluster associated with the sgr dwarf galaxy @xcite . for the case of pal  12",
    ", in addition to the difference in age of several gyr , it being younger than the bulk of the galactic gcs @xcite , we found evidence for substantive differences between the chemical history of pal  12 and that of the `` normal '' halo gcs of similar [ fe / h ] is given by @xmath4 on a scale where @xmath5 h atoms . then [ x / h ] = log[n(x)/n(h ) ] @xmath6 log[n(x)/n(h ) ] , and similarly for [ x / fe ] . ] .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the outer halo gc ngc  7492 , a cluster which is not suspected ( yet ) of being part of any known stream or otherwise abnormal .",
    "we compare the abundance ratios deduced from high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio for four giants in this distant outer halo gc with those from our recent analysis of a large sample of stars in the relatively nearby and well studied gcs m3 and m13 , which have metallicities close to that of ngc  7492 .",
    "we look for evidence in the deduced abundance ratios of some difference in the formation mechanisms or chemical history of gcs in the `` normal '' outer halo .",
    "there has been no previous high dispersion study of ngc  7492 .",
    "@xcite obtained [ fe / h ] = @xmath7 dex using their narrow band q39 photometric system , @xcite derived @xmath8 dex from the @xmath9 method applied to two rr lyrae variables in the cluster , while moderate dispersion spectroscopy in the region of the infrared ca triplet by @xcite gave [ fe / h ] = @xmath10 dex .",
    "given the large distance of ngc  7492 , we select the brightest possible stars on the upper rgb for observation , making no attempt to reach fainter luminosities . these stars were picked from the photometric study of this cluster by @xcite . since this is a rather sparse cluster , these stars , which are the four brightest suspected members ,",
    "lie distributed along the upper rgb , not concentrated at the rgb tip .",
    "the positions of these stars in a @xmath12 cmd are illustrated in figure  [ figure_cmd ] superposed on the predicted cluster isochrone from the @xcite evolutionary tracks ; see figure  10 of @xcite for a @xmath13 cmd of ngc  7492 . although the cluster is distant , there are so few luminous giants that they must be observed as single stars ; two of them can not be fit into a single 7 arcsec long slit .",
    "spectra were obtained with hires @xcite at the keck observatory 20 - 22 august 2003 .",
    "the instrument configuration covered the range 4650 to 7010   , with small gaps between the orders at the red end .",
    "this is the `` yellow '' configuration described in @xcite .",
    "these data were reduced using a combination of figaro @xcite scripts and the software package makee .",
    "the desired minimum snr was 90 over a 4 pixel resolution element for a wavelength near the center of the hires detector .",
    "this is calculated strictly from the counts in the object spectrum , and excludes noise from cosmic ray hits , sky subtraction , flattening problems , etc . since the nights were relatively dark , sky subtraction is not an issue except at the specific wavelengths corresponding to strong night sky emission lines , such as the na d doublet .",
    "the seeing was extremely good during these nights , making the exposures shorter than normal , and enabling us to reach this goal for the stars reported here .",
    "table  [ table_sample ] gives details of the hires exposures for each star , with the total exposure time for each object .",
    "all long integrations were broken up into separate exposures , each 1200 sec long , to optimize cosmic ray removal .",
    "the last column of the table gives the heliocentric radial velocity for each star , measured from the hires spectra ; see @xcite for the details of the procedure used to determine @xmath14 .    the radial velocity of ngc  7492is large and negative , and the cluster abundance is low .",
    "it was easy to tell after one integration whether or not a star is a member of the cluster .",
    "approximate measurements of @xmath14 were made on line ; all stars attempted turned out to be radial velocity members of ngc  7492 .",
    "the four rgb stars have a mean @xmath14 of @xmath15 km  s@xmath16 , agreeing well within the errors with the early measurement of @xcite of a single bright cluster member , but somewhat larger than the value of @xmath17  km  s@xmath16  found from moderate resolution spectra by @xcite .",
    "our more accurate @xmath14 for ngc  7492  should be used in future computations of the mass of the galaxy which rely on the orbits of its outlying satellites .",
    "the velocity dispersion from the four members , with no correction for an instrumental contribution , is @xmath18 = 1.2@xmath191 km  s@xmath16 , reflecting the low mass of this sparse cluster ; the observed @xmath18 is only slightly larger than the expected instrumental uncertainties .",
    "we follow the procedures developed in our earlier work on globular cluster stars and described in @xcite to determine the stellar parameters for the four rgb stars in ngc  7492 .",
    "@xmath11  is derived by comparing reddening - corrected broad band colors with the predictions of grids of model atmospheres .",
    "we utilize here the grid of predicted broad band colors and bolometric corrections of @xcite based on the marcs stellar atmosphere code of @xcite .",
    "we normally utilize @xmath20 and @xmath21 colors to determine @xmath11 .",
    "the infrared colors were taken from 2mass @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided @xmath22 photographic photometry over a large field including the entire cluster of ngc  7492 .",
    "ccd photometry in @xmath13 was presented by @xcite , but their field is smaller than the cluster and the calibration of their photometry is not secure .",
    "@xcite , in the course of a study of blue stragglers in this cluster , obtained ccd @xmath13 photometry for a large sample of stars , but the data tables were never published and have subsequently been lost ( ct , private communication , 2004 ) .",
    "the two published photometric studies of ngc  7492   give @xmath23 mags which are inconsistent by several tenths of a mag ; the differences are not just a simple offset .",
    "we therefore measured @xmath12 for our sample stars from andicam images taken for this purpose on aug . 1 , 2004 with the 1.3 m telescope at ctio operated by the smarts consortium ;",
    "these values are given in table  [ table_sample ] .",
    "andicam is a dual channel cammera constructed by the ohio state university instrument group , but only the optical channel was used .",
    "our andicam program requires photometric conditions , and additional standard star fields , charged to our andicam allocation through noao , are always taken for us .",
    "we adopt a distance for ngc  7492  of 26.2 kpc @xcite ( as compared to 7.5 kpc for m13 and 10.4 kpc for m3 ) , with a reddening of e(b  v ) = 0.036 mag from @xcite . the relative extinction in various passbands",
    "is taken from @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the adopted stellar parameters are given in table  [ table_teff ] .",
    "to the maximum extent possible , the atomic data and the analysis procedures used here are identical to those we used in our recently completed analysis of a large sample of stars in m3 and m13 @xcite .",
    "in particular , see  3 of that paper for a description of the measurement of the equivalent widths ( listed for the four stars in ngc  7492 in table  [ table_eqw ] ) ,  4 for a discussion of the atomic parameters ,  4.2 for our adopted solar abundances ( tabulated in table  2 of our earlier paper , and repeated as table  [ table_sun ] here ) , and  6 for a description of our abundance analysis procedures . as in our earlier work , the abundance analysis is carried out using a current version of the lte spectral synthesis program moog @xcite .",
    "we employ the grid of stellar atmospheres from @xcite without convective overshoot , when available .",
    "the template file of suitable unblended lines with their adopted atomic parameters is identical to that we used in our recently completed analysis of m3 and of m13 @xcite .",
    "three of the four stars gave @xmath24 km  s@xmath16  based on deriving a uniform fe abundance as a function of @xmath25  for the large set of fe  i lines .",
    "the fourth star ( star  r ) gave 1.8  km  s@xmath16 ; this value was also set to 2.0  km  s@xmath16 .",
    "lines with @xmath25@xmath26 175  mwere ignored , except for the ba  ii lines in the coolest star in our sample in ngc  7492 .    the resulting abundance ratios for the four rgb stars in ngc  7492  are given in tables  [ table_abund_a ] to [ table_abund_e ] .",
    "species with only one detected line are assigned an uncertainty of 0.10 dex .",
    "table  7 of @xcite indicates the changes in derived abundance ratios for small changes in the adopted stellar parameters , the [ fe / h ] for the adopted model atmosphere , or the set of @xmath25for the lines of each species , and is appropriate for use here as well .",
    "the mean abundance and 1@xmath18 variance for the species observed in ngc  7492  are listed in table  [ table_abundsig ] .",
    "the oxygen abundance is derived from the forbidden lines at 6300 and 6363   .",
    "the subtraction of the night sky emission lines for the forbidden lines was reasonably straightforward given that the radial velocity of ngc  7492  is sufficiently different from 0 km  s@xmath16   that their @xmath25  can be reliably measured .",
    "the c / o ratio was assumed to be solar .",
    "cn and ni  i contamination is negligable ( see * ? ? ?",
    "[ o / fe ] is given with respect to fe  ii ; abundance ratios for all other elements are given with respect to fe  i.    the deduced mean [ fe / h ] of ngc  7492  value is in good agreement with that inferred by @xcite from moderate dispersion spectra in the region of the infrared ca triplet .",
    "the na abundance was obtained from the 5680    doublet for all four stars .",
    "we have , as in our previous papers , not used any non - lte corrections for na .",
    "calculations by @xcite suggest values of between 0.1 and 0.2 dex are appropriate for our sample in ngc  7492 , with the coolest star having the largest value .",
    "calculations by @xcite suggest somewhat smaller values .",
    "the ba abundance of star  950 in ngc  7492  appears to be @xmath270.2 dex larger than that of the other cluster members studied here .",
    "however , the detected lines of ba  ii are all within the range where substantial hfs corrections occur .",
    "table  7 of @xcite shows the very high sensitivity of the deduced ba abundances to small uncertainties in the equivalent width and microturbulence of the ba  ii lines we use . on the other hand , the deduced [ y / fe ]",
    "is also somewhat high for this star , while the deduced fe is the lowest of all the stars in our sample .",
    "perhaps a slight adjustment of @xmath11  for this star is required . at this point",
    ", we assume this is the result of observational and modelling uncertainties and does not indicate a real spread in [ ba / fe ] within ngc  7492 , but further verification of this is desirable .",
    "the abundances of the elements with respect to fe , [ x / fe ] , as a function of @xmath11  are shown in figure  [ figure_o_si ] , covering o , na , mg and si , figure  [ figure_ca_v ] , which includes ca , sc , ti and v , figure  [ figure_cr_ni ] , which includes cr , mn , co and ni , figure  [ figure_cu_zr ] , which includes cu , zn , y and zr , and figure  [ figure_ba_dy ] , for ba , la , nd , eu and dy . note the apparent star - to - star variation in [ o / fe ] and in [ na / fe ] , which becomes undetectably small , if it exists at all , for the elements heavier than na .",
    "the scatter for [ ca / fe ] and for [ ni / fe ] , with 8 to 13 detected absorption lines in each star , is remarkably small , @xmath28 dex over the four star sample in ngc  7492 .",
    "to check for the presence of star - to - star variations in abundance ratios within the small sample of rgb stars in ngc  7492 , we use a parameter we call the `` spread ratio '' ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the numerator of @xmath29 is the 1@xmath18 rms variance for the sample of four stars in ngc  7492   about the mean abundance for each atomic species ( @xmath30 ) with detected absorption lines , denoted @xmath18 ; the relevant values are given in the first three columns of table  [ table_abundsig ] .",
    "the denominator of @xmath29 is the total expected uncertainty , @xmath31 , which is the sum in quadrature of the known contributing terms .",
    "included are a term corresponding to an uncertainty of 50  k in @xmath11 , the same for an uncertainty of 0.2 dex in log(@xmath32 ) , and for an uncertainty of 0.2  km  s@xmath16  in @xmath33 , and the observed uncertainty [ @xmath34 , the parameter @xmath35 , which is calculated from data given in tables  [ table_abund_a ] to [ table_abund_e ] , is taken as the variance about the mean abundance for a given species in a given star , i.e. the 1@xmath18 rms value about the mean abundance of species @xmath30 in a given star/@xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of observed lines of species @xmath30 .",
    "it includes contributions from errors in the measured @xmath25 , random errors ( i.e. between lines of a given species ) in the adopted @xmath38 values , etc . some species , an example being fe  i with its very large value of @xmath37 , have unrealistically small values of @xmath35 ; we adopt a minimum of 0.05 dex for this parameter .",
    "the ratio @xmath39 is an indication of whether there is any intrinsic star - to - star variation in [ x / fe ] .",
    "a high value of this `` spread ratio '' , tabulated in the fifth column of this table , suggests a high probability of intrinsic scatter for the abundance of the species @xmath30 .",
    "ideally the mean @xmath29 for those elements with no star - to - star variation should be unity ; for many species the measured @xmath29 is close to that value , certainly closer here than for the sample in m3 and in m13 we studied earlier @xcite .",
    "inspection of table  [ table_abundsig ] shows that for all but two species @xmath40 for the sample of four stars in ngc  7492 , indicating little sign of an intrinsic star - to - star range in abundance .",
    "o  i and na  i , however , have the two largest values of @xmath29 , 1.3 and 3.0 respectively . note that @xmath29 for mg  i is 0.5 , suggesting no real star - to - star abundance variations for this element .",
    "we therefore assume that the range of abundances seen in our sample of rgb stars in ngc  7492for na  i and o  i represent real star - to - star abundance variations ; while no other element shows definite evidence for such variations from this simple analysis .",
    "c , n , o , na , mg , and al are known to show correlated abundance variations from star - to - star among the most luminous stars in globular clusters ; see , e.g. the review of @xcite .",
    "our simple spread ratio analysis ( see  [ section_spread ] ) shows definite star - to - star variations in abundance of both o and na in our small sample of rgb stars in ngc  7492 .",
    "variations in mg , if present are smaller and subtle .",
    "it is well established that o and na are anti - correlated among luminous giants in globular clusters , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite compiled the data from the literature , combined it with their own , and showed that the same linear relation can be used to fit the o and na data for all globular clusters studied in detail thus far .",
    "the latest addition to the clusters studied in detail , ngc  2808 , by @xcite , does so as well .",
    "figure  [ figure_ona ] shows the relationship between na and o abundances ( both with respect to fe ) for our sample in ngc  7492 .",
    "also superposed is the line representing the fit for this anti - correlation determined by @xcite for the luminous giants in m3 , shifted by @xmath60.07 dex and + 0.1 dex in the vertical and horizontal axis as compared to the relation we found for m13 @xcite .",
    "the first and last quartiles of the o  na anti - correlation seen by @xcite in their sample of luminous giants in m3 are indicated .",
    "there is a reasonably clear anti - correlation which corresponds well with that seen for luminous giants in other well studied galactic gcs ( see , e.g. the compilation of * ? ? ?",
    "a similar correlation is detected in the outer halo gc ngc  7006 by @xcite .",
    "there is marginally statistically significant evidence for a correlation between [ na / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] for our small sample in ngc  7492 , similar to that shown in other gcs ( see , for example , figures 12 and 13 of * ? ? ?",
    "the larger uncertainty in our deduced [ mg / fe ] ratios makes this result quite uncertain .",
    "we now turn to what we can learn about the chemical history of the galaxy by comparing the abundance ratios in ngc  7492 , at a galactocentric distance of 25 kpc , with those from our recent analysis of the inner halo gcs , m3 and m13 @xcite in m3 and m13 , with @xmath0 of 12 and 9 kpc respectively .",
    "we note that the atomic parameters , the analysis procedures , and the software packages used are identical in both of these studies",
    ". hence we should be able to detect small differences in the relative values of the abundance ratios of these three gcs .",
    "table  [ table_abundcomp ] gives the parameter @xmath41[x / fe ] , which is , for each species with detected lines , the mean abundance ratio [ x / fe ] for ngc  7492  with the average of the same parameter for m3 and for m13 subtracted . because of the large star - to - star differences in o / fe seen in m3 and especially in m13 , we subtract the mean [ o / fe ] for stars in m13 of luminosities comparable to those we observe in ngc  7492 .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a luminosity dependence of [ mg / fe ] in m13 , most probably due to the luminosity dependence of non - lte corrections , which were ignored . again in this case we subtract the mean [ mg / fe ] of stars of comparable luminosity in m13 to those observed in ngc  7492 .",
    "if we allow @xmath42 dex as a tolerable range given the potential internal and systematic errors in the analyses of these three gcs , we find that 80% of the 20 elements in common have a difference of 0.0@xmath42 dex , with only si , cr and co outside that range .",
    "figure  [ figure_abundcomp_m3m13 ] shows the resulting differences in [ x / fe ] as a function of atomic number",
    ". the abundance ratios of [ x / fe ] for si and co are each larger in ngc  7492  than they are in m3 and m13 , while that of cr is smaller .",
    "the largest magnitude of the set of @xmath41[x / fe ] occurs for si , and is + 0.23 dex .",
    "galactic chemical evolution produces trends in abundance ratios as a function of metallicity .",
    "the case of [ si / fe ] is illustrated in figure  [ figure_sife ] , where metallicity is parameterized by [ fe / h ] ; examples for the elements ca , ti and ba are given in figures  21 , 22 and 23 of @xcite .",
    "we use the same set of of high precision analyses of gcs as in @xcite , specifically ngc 6528 @xcite , ngc  6553 @xcite , 47 tuc @xcite , m71 @xcite , m5 @xcite , ngc  288 @xcite , ngc  362 @xcite , ngc  6752 @xcite , m3 @xcite , m13 @xcite , ngc  6397 @xcite and m15 @xcite , adding in ngc  7492  as well . to characterize the behavior of the metal - poor halo field stars , we adopt abundance ratios from recent large surveys of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and by @xcite .",
    "no effort has been made to homogenize these analyses , but since the field star surveys were carried out over the course of more than a decade , we have corrected for the difference in the solar fe abundance adopted by each .",
    "given that ngc  7492  has [ fe / h ] 0.35 dex smaller than the mean value for m3 and m13 , we have attempted to evaluate the correction to the difference caused by these global trends .",
    "we can only do this for about half of the elements studied here .",
    "this correction is given in the last column of table  [ table_abundcomp ] , and is to be subtracted from the value of @xmath41[x / fe ] to form @xmath43[x / fe ] .",
    "these corrections , which do not exceed 0.1 dex in magnitude , bring @xmath43[si / fe ] , @xmath43[cr / fe ] and @xmath43[co / fe ] within the range consistent with no difference ( 0.0@xmath42 dex ) , while not causing any additional elements to exceed the allowed range for equality .",
    "the corrections for si , cr and co are shown on figure  [ figure_abundcomp_m3m13 ] as well .",
    "thus after implementing the corrections for global chemical evolution , all the elements in common show identical abundance ratios [ x / fe ] for ngc  7492   as for m3 and m13 , allowing for a @xmath42 dex tolerance ; 75% of the 20 values of @xmath43[x / fe ] lie within the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 dex .",
    "this suggests that the galactic chemical evolution of the outer halo at @xmath0 25 kpc has been identical to that of the well studied inner halo gcs , at least up to the time of the formation of the old globular clusters ngc  7492 , m3 and m13",
    ". in particular , our limited evidence , based on ba , la and eu abundance ratios , suggests the neutron capture processes , both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , appear to have had similar histories throughout the spatial extent of the halo for old gc stars .",
    "we have carried a detailed abundance analysis for 21 elements in a sample of four rgb stars in the metal poor distant outer halo globular cluster ngc  7492([fe / h ] @xmath48 dex ) .",
    "the analyzed spectra , obtained with hires at the keck observatory , are of high dispersion ( r=@xmath3=35,000 ) .",
    "most elements show no sign of star - to - star variation within our limited sample .",
    "we have , however , detected an anti - correlation between o and na abundances similar to that seen in our previous analyses of inner halo gcs as well as in studies of relatively nearby gcs by other .",
    "a correlation between mg and na abundance may also be present .",
    "we have compared the abundance ratios in ngc  7492  with those we previously determined for the much closer old halo gcs m3 and m13 @xcite , hoping that since all these analyses were carried out by the same two people within a timespan of only a few months in a completely consistent manner , with the same line lists , the same atomic parameters , the same analysis codes and procedures , etc . that small differences in the abundance ratios might be detectable .",
    "we evaluate the trends of abundance ratio with metallicity for old halo stars from our data combined with published large surveys of halo field star abundances .",
    "we then apply corrections to the abundances we derived for m3 and m13 for each species , when feasible , to extrapolate them to the 0.35 dex smaller [ fe / h ] of ngc  7492 . after making such corrections , all the elements in common show identical abundance ratios for ngc  7492  and for m3 and m13 , allowing for a @xmath42 dex tolerance , and 75% of them are then within the tolerance @xmath190.10 dex .",
    "this suggests that the galactic chemical evolution of the outer halo at @xmath0 25 kpc has been identical to that of the well studied much closer inner halo gcs , at least up to the time of the formation of the old globular clusters ngc  7492 , m3 and m13",
    ". in particular , our limited evidence , based on ba , la and eu abundance ratios , suggests the neutron capture processes , both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , appear to have had similar histories throughout the spatial extent of the halo for old gc stars as well .",
    "the presence of the o / na anti - correlation in ngc  7492 , with @xmath0 of 25 kpc , and the similarity of its chemical history to that of the well studied nearby gcs , provide new constraints on any model of gc formation in the galactic halo .",

    "<S> , we find that for for these three gcs for each of the elements in common we deduce identical abundance ratios with respect to fe to within the probable measurement uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the chemical history of the outer halo as exemplified by the metal - poor outer halo globular cluster ngc  7492is indistinguishable from that of the inner halo , exemplified by m3 and m13 , at least through the epoch of formation of these old globular clusters . </S>",
