    "furthermore , an explicit dependence on the aspect ratio is not contained in any of the existing scaling theories for the turbulent heat transfer ( siggia 1994 , grossmann & lohse 2000 ) .",
    "grossmann & lohse ( 2003 ) discussed geometry effects by including variations of the kinetic boundary layer thickness at the plates and side walls as a function of the aspect ratio .",
    "however , they found that the global heat transfer laws remained independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because their argumentation is built on the volume flux conservation which requires a large scale flow  a so - called  wind of turbulence \" .",
    "in fact all existing scaling theories require such a large - scale flow for the ansatz of their boundary layer dynamics .",
    "it is , however , well - known that the coherent large - scale circulations present at @xmath22 break down into more complex and less coherent patterns when the aspect ratio is increased far beyond unity .",
    "such phenomena were reported by several authors : for example by means of fourier spectrum analysis ( hartlep _ et al .",

    "we therefore want to study the dependence of convective turbulence on the aspect ratio in a cylindrical cell by three - dimensional direct numerical simulations .",

    "the present analysis addresses the following three questions : does the turbulent heat transfer at fixed rayleigh and prandtl numbers depend on the aspect ratio ?",

    "this aspect has been discussed in part in hartlep _",
    "( 2003 ) and du puits _ et al . _",
    "which fraction of the total kinetic energy is carried and how much heat is transferred by the large - scale circulation ( lsc ) ? answering the last question requires a systematic disentanglement of the turbulent large- and small - scale flow and temperature patterns .",
    "therefore , we conduct proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) of the turbulent flow fields .",
    "we observe a dependence of the heat transfer  as measured by the dimensionless nusselt number @xmath5 on @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence is due to the rearrangement of the large - scale flow patterns with varying aspect ratio .",
    "although the flow is fully turbulent , the time - averaged velocity field patterns will exhibit morphological similarities with the structures which have been observed at the onset of convection ( charlson & sani 1971 , oresta _ et al .",
    "_ 2007 ) or in the weakly nonlinear regime right above the onset of convection ( see e.g. busse & whitehead 1971 , croquette 1989 , clever & busse 1989 , bodenschatz _ et al .",

    "it makes up about one half of the total amount .",
    "this contribution increases by 10% due to the transition from a single - roll to a double - roll pattern between @xmath67 2.5 and 3 for @xmath12 .",
    "the double - roll lsc can carry more heat through the cell since the number of up- and downwelling regions with @xmath68 increases across the cell .",
    "this can also be seen in the plots in the lower row of fig .",
    "one can consider the dynamics around @xmath69 as a bottleneck for the heat transfer .",
    "the one - roll pattern gets ever flatter with increasing @xmath0 and can thus transfer heat less efficiently through the cell .",
    "once the two - roll pattern is established , this bottleneck is removed and the share of the primary mode in the total heat transfer increases .",
    "the same transition appears between aspect ratios of 2 and 2.5 for @xmath13 .",
    "again , we detect a jump of the primary mode contribution by 12% .",
    "the opposite is the case for the slender cell at @xmath70 .",
    "one observes a much lower @xmath5 fraction due to the primary mode in comparison to the cases with @xmath71 .",
    "this can be attributed to the complex flow configuration in the slender cell , in which there are either two counter - rotating rolls on top of each other , or one slender roll ( verzicco & camussi 2003 , xi & xia 2008a ) .",
    "the secondary and higher - order modes provide information that can be obtained within the present pod analysis only .",
    "the fraction of the secondary pod mode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) to the global heat transfer is much smaller than that of the primary .",
    "it is about 5% for the larger aspect ratios and remains almost insensitive when the primary mode switches from a one - roll to a two - roll pattern .",
    "a closer inspection of both plots suggests , however , that an increase of the portion of the total heat transfer due to the primary mode causes a decrease of that of the secondary mode .",
    "this is clearly indicated for @xmath70 and 1 in both @xmath12 and @xmath72 series , and for @xmath63 , 2.5 and 3 in the series with @xmath13 .",
    "it further supports our arguments in the last paragraph .",
    "the local minimum of the secondary pod mode contribution coincides with the local maximum of the primary one .",
    "when the primary mode becomes less efficient in transferring heat , the secondary mode has to take a bigger share .",
    "the two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] display finally the time dependence of the expansion coefficients of the first three pod modes , @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "the graphs are obtained by projecting the 100 snapshots onto the pod modes @xmath75 for @xmath74 . while the primary modes remains nearly constant",
    ", we see that the secondary and tertiary modes oscillate with a period of approximately @xmath76 and are shifted with respect to each other by about @xmath77 . the secondary and tertiary mode",
    "contribute thus mainly to temporal variance of the heat transfer .",
    "their time - averaged contributions remain , however , significantly lower than that of the primary mode .",
    "within the parameter range of the present study , the dns results have revealed a dependence of the nusselt number on the aspect ratio .",
    "the variation in @xmath9 curve is between 11% and 3% , depending on the rayleigh number and the range of accessible aspect ratios .",
    "a minimum of @xmath9 is found at @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "this is exactly the point where the lsc undergoes a transition from a single - roll to a double - roll pattern .",
    "the trend in @xmath9 curve indicates that the heat transfer becomes independent of the aspect ratio of the cylindrical cell for sufficiently large aspect ratios .",
    "this is @xmath78 at @xmath12 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "the lsc patterns reorganize from roll shape to pentagonal or hexagonal structures with increasing @xmath0 and fixed @xmath1 as well as with increasing @xmath1 and fixed @xmath0 .",
    "we provide arguments , which rationalize the non - monotonic graphs @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the power law relation @xmath6 gives rise to a coefficient @xmath82 which decreases from 0.165 to 0.118 and an exponent @xmath83 which increases from 0.287 to 0.305 .",
    "furthermore , they follow algebraic scaling relations @xmath84 and @xmath85 , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 for aspect ratios between 0.5 and 4 and rayleigh numbers between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we believe that it is important to include this dependence , albeit weak , in future scaling theories .",
    "the variation of @xmath8 seems to bridge the gap between the well - known exponents @xmath882/7 and 1/3 , which have been measured in the past .",
    "further studies at higher rayleigh numbers and larger aspect ratios have to be conducted to draw a firm conclusion on the robustness of the observed scaling .",
    "we can not comment on the trend with respect to prandtl number , which will exist as indicated in hartlep _",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the primary pod mode contains most of the energy , and transports about one half of the global heat for @xmath71 .",
    "their contribution to the total heat transfer varies with @xmath0 and @xmath1 as indicated in table 3 .",
    "this has been demonstrated with the help of a karhunen - love analysis of samples of turbulent convection field .",
    "we also observe that the lsc patterns in turbulent convection at @xmath24 are still strikingly similar to those in the weakly nonlinear regime immediately beyond the onset of convection ( bodenschatz _ et al .",
    "the system does not seem to  forget \" these patterns .",
    "this might partly be attributed to the closed volume , in which the studies are conducted .",
    "a large - scale circulation is , therefore , always present similar to high - reynolds number turbulence in von krman swirling flows ( la porta _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) or taylor vortex flows ( lathrop _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) .",
    "one possible argument against our observation of @xmath0dependent nusselt number could be that the rayleigh number for the given prandtl number @xmath2 is still too small and that the convective turbulence has not yet reached the so - called hard turbulence regime , as discussed for example by castaing _",
    "( 1989 ) . in order to weaken this argument",
    ", we determine the dissipation scale and relate it to the height of the cell . since @xmath89 , the diffusive scale of the temperature , the corrsin scale @xmath90 , is larger than the kolmogorov scale @xmath91 .",
    "the scale separation ratio gives : @xmath92133 , 278 and 588 for @xmath12 , @xmath72 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "here @xmath16 is directly evaluated from the energy dissipation field as discussed in section 2 . even if we take a fraction of h , the scale separation is of @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , for all the rayleigh numbers discussed here , we reported strongly non - gaussian temperature statistics in emran & schumacher ( 2008 ) , which clearly indicate that the convective motion is in a state of fully developed turbulence .",
    "further numerical simulations and experiments in the regime of large aspect ratio and high rayleigh number are necessary .",
    "one can expect that the aspect - ratio - dependence of the turbulent heat transfer will disappear for sufficiently large @xmath0 and that turbulent convection approaches an asymptotic geometric regime in which the physics becomes independent of side wall effects . to achieve those goals , some efforts are underway for the cylindrical case and",
    "will hopefully shed more light on the dependencies @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the heat transport law as reported in fig .",
    "another important aspect , in our view , would be to conduct a closer study of the same issues for fixed flux boundary conditions ( which correspond , for example , to a radiative cooling on top of an atmospheric boundary layer ) .",
    "recently , the first step in this direction has been undertaken by verzicco & sreenivasan ( 2007 ) and johnston & doering ( 2008 ) .",
