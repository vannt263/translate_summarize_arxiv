    "the possibility of light soliton propagation in a silica fiber was first predicted by hasegawa and tappert in 1973 @xcite . since",
    "then a tremendous amount of work has been done on both theoretical and experimental aspects of light soliton propagation . moreover",
    ", optical fiber technology has become the centerpiece of wired telecommunications , with optical fiber networks crossing oceans and webbing continents , carrying the world s digital communications in the form of light soliton pulses .",
    "the property of the silica fiber that makes soliton propagation possible is the kerr nonlinearity , _",
    "i.e. _ the dependence of the index of refraction @xmath0 on the intensity of light @xmath1 : @xmath2 from this one can straightforwardly derive the equation that governs the propagation of light inside the fiber , the non - linear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the envelope of the electric field in ( [ nlse ] ) denotes position along the fiber and @xmath5 denotes time in the comoving frame . ] and @xmath6 .",
    "the positive value of @xmath7 , describing light propagation in the anomalous dispesion regime , gives the attractive nlse that admits solitonic solutions with zero boundary conditions ( bright solitons ) .",
    "for @xmath8 we get the repulsive nlse , which is valid in the normal dispersion regime and admits solitons for nonvanishing boundary conditions ( dark solitons ) . for either sign of @xmath7 ,",
    "the nlse is an integrable hamiltonian system .",
    "it belongs to a class of nonlinear equations ( together with the kdv equation , the sine - gordon equations and others ) that can be solved exactly by means of the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) technique ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "optical fiber channels are capable of extremely high data transfer rates and constant technological improvements have led to an almost exponential increase in real - world transmission rates .",
    "the question naturally arises then , _",
    "what is the upper bound imposed on the bit rate by the physics of the optical fiber , irrespective of any particular technological setup _ ?",
    "the natural framework in which one can address this question is that of information theory , developed by shannon @xcite . in any communication channel ,",
    "the limiting factor for the rate at which it can carry information is the noise that unavoidably enters along the channel and corrupts the data .",
    "shannon introduced the concept of _ channel capacity _ , defined as the maximum possible bit - rate for error - free transmission .",
    "the channel capacity @xmath9 is defined by : @xmath10 - \\left\\langle h[y|x ] \\right\\rangle_{p_x } \\right\\ } \\label{capacity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the output ( received ) signal , @xmath5 is the input ( sent ) signal , @xmath12 is the probability distribution of  symbols \" in @xmath5 ( be it letters , fourier components , soliton modes or what it may ) , and @xmath13 is the entropy of information : @xmath14\\equiv - \\int dx p_x \\log p_x \\label{entropy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the maximum in ( [ capacity ] ) is taken among all possible input distributions @xmath12 .",
    "the two quantities that ultimately determine the performance of the channel are the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) for the received signal and the bandwidth . for a linear channel ( e.g. a copper wire ) with additive noise , shannon s celebrated result @xcite states that @xmath15 @xmath16 being the bandwidth to a maximum of @xmath17 thz @xcite .",
    "systems in practical use at the moment have a @xmath18 thz bandwidth . ] and @xmath19 , @xmath20 the average power of the signal and the noise respectively .    however , modern fiber - optics systems operate in a substantially non - linear regime , rendering the assumption of linearity used to derive ( [ shannon ] ) invalid .",
    "the additive noise in fiber - optics systems comes from periodically spaced amplifiers ( usually erbium - doped segments of fiber ) that offset the loss in the electric field amplitude along the fiber .",
    "these inject noise into the signal , mainly because of amplified spontaneous emission of photons ( ase ) @xcite . the initial approach to the effects of noise was to determine how the additive amplifier noise perturbs single solitons , and calculate the jitter introduced into the soliton trains .",
    "the result is the so called gordon - haus jitter @xcite . for both dark and bright solitons",
    ", one finds that the perturbation in the frequency ( which is also proportional to the velocity of the soliton ) is a zero - mean gaussian with variance proportional to the strength of the amplifier noise and the amplitude of the soliton .",
    "this results in a jitter in the soliton arrival times that can cause reading errors at the receiver .",
    "a lot of work has been done on overcoming the restrictions in bit rate due to this effect ] .",
    "the mechanisms proposed typically involve some form of optical filters or dispersion compensation , such as sliding - frequency filters @xcite , synchronous modulation @xcite , optical phase conjugation @xcite , and dispersion managed solitons @xcite ( there are numerous papers on the subject of suppressing the gordon - haus effect , see ch.12 of @xcite for a partial list of references ) .",
    "this approach is useful when one is considering specific signaling schemes that use soliton trains of fixed amplitude and inter - soliton distance , but to answer the question of maximum achievable channel capacity we need to abandon the single - soliton assumption and venture out towards a more abstract and general method . in shannon s theory of linear channels , for an input with a given average power one can show that the the maximal distribution in ( [ capacity ] ) is the gaussian . for the nonlinear channel under study ,",
    "the maximal distribution is much harder to find , but one can still obtain bounds that convey the qualitative behavior of @xmath9 as a function of the snr by using a gaussian as input @xcite . starting with a zero - mean gaussian random electric field",
    "with given , constant second moment , we calculate the density of soliton modes produced by it inside the fiber .",
    "the soliton modes are the natural degrees of freedom to use , like the fourier coefficients would be for a linear channel .",
    "the distribution of ( either dark or bright ) soliton modes is calculated as the density of states ( density of eigenvalues ) of the linear operator associated with the nlse in the context of the inverse scattering transform . for the nlse , the associated linear problem is the @xmath21 zakharov - shabat eigenvalue problem @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of the zakharov - shabat system includes both continuous and discrete eigenvalues .",
    "we are interested in the discrete eigenvalues , because they correspond to soliton modes , and these can be isolated by imposing zero boundary conditions on the eigenstates .",
    "one can then use adiabatic perturbation theory based on the ist to compute the statistical uncertainty introduced in the eigevalues by the amplifier noise .",
    "this leads to a different distribution at the output , from which the mutual information can be found , and the aforementioned bounds on the capacity @xmath9 can in principle be computed .",
    "the implementation of adiabatic perturbation theory can only be done numerically in the dense soliton limit that we are examining .",
    "for dark solitons , the associated linear eigenvalue problem is hermitian : @xmath22 to isolate the soliton modes , we impose the boundary conditions @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "hermiticity means that the eigenvalue @xmath25 is real . for a single soliton",
    ", @xmath25 would give both the velocity and the amplitude of the soliton .",
    "in the dense soliton case we are interested in , the eigenvalues are the collective degrees of freedom of the soliton modes .",
    "the  potential \" @xmath26 is the initial condition of the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) or , in the case of optical fibers , where ` @xmath5 ' denotes time , the envelope of the electric field that goes into the fiber .",
    "we choose @xmath27 to be gaussian random , i.e. @xmath28 with @xmath29 real , @xmath30 , and @xmath31,@xmath32 .",
    "the constraint on the second moments of @xmath33 translates to a power constraint for the ingoing electric field , specifically that it has average power @xmath34 .",

    "they have a wide range of applications , in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , random classical dynamics , the physics of polymers , qcd , neural networks , and , in the case at hand , soliton physics and communications .",
    "non - hermiticity means that the eigenvalues migrate to the complex plane .",
    "this complicates the computation of their statistical properties - most notably their dos - relative to hermitian operators .",

    "we were able to compute the distribution of @xmath91 resulting from a random gaussian input analytically by using the definition of @xmath91 and expressing it in terms of the behavior of the eigenfunctions at the edges of the pulse , which in turn we can express as sums of random variables with calculable distributions .",

    "historically , there has been a steady exponential increase in the transmission capacity of fiber optics communications systems , resulting mainly from higher transmission rates and the implementation of wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) .",
    "wdm systems generally use binary on - off keying as their signaling scheme , thus limiting the spectral efficiency ( bits transmitted per second per hz of bandwidth ) to 1 b / s / hz . more complicated signaling schemes can go beyond this limit , and will eventually be required in order to make use of the potential of the optical fiber network . some amount of interesting work has been done on the question of the capacity limits for wdm and related systems , both analytical and numerical ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , in @xcite the spectral efficiency predicted is about @xmath131 , in the absence of jitter . in our model we consider a single - channel mode instead of the multi - channel setup of wdm .",

    "<S> the explosion of demand for ultra - high information transmission rates over the last decade has necessitated the usage of increasingly high light intensities for fiber optical transmissions . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the fiber non - linearities need to be treated non - perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> similar analyses in the past have focused on the effects of non - linearities on existing transmission technologies , e.g. wdm . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we take advantage of the fact that , under certain assumptions , light transmission through optical fibers can be described using the non - linear schroedinger equation , which is exactly integrable . as a particular example </S>",
    "<S> , we show that in the low gaussian noise limit , the gaussian input distribution has a higher mutual information than the transmission using wdm over the same available bandwidth . </S>"
