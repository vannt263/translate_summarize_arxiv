    "how exactly are we to consider a d - brane on a  space @xmath1 ?",
    "the basic picture would be some cycle @xmath2 perhaps equipped with some kind of vector bundle @xmath3 .",
    "there has to be more to d - branes than this however .",
    "it has been known since the early days of mirror symmetry , from works such as candelas et al @xcite , that the general notion of a cycle @xmath2 is far from clear and perhaps not even well - defined .",
    "suppose one begins with an even - dimensional cycle lying in some homology class .",
    "the simplest example would be a point whose homology class lies in @xmath4 .",
    "upon `` parallel transport '' around a loop in the moduli space of the complexified khler form , @xmath5 , this homology class is generally transformed into some other element of @xmath6 .",
    "thus the point appears to have transformed magically into a general collection of even - dimensional cycles .    based in the ideas of mukai @xcite , kontsevich @xcite realized that this monodromy appeared fairly naturally in the more abstract setting of the derived category of coherent sheaves . a more direct analysis of d - branes in terms of the derived category",
    "was then pioneered in @xcite together with further analysis in @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to show explicitly what happens physically to the d - branes as we undergo such monodromy .",
    "we focus purely on even - dimensional ( b - type ) d - branes . in order to do this",
    "we have to first study the notion of stability of a d - brane which is itself a very interesting subject .",
    "the notion of stability we use is the @xmath0-stability of @xcite . as generalized in @xcite , this is a criterion determining which elements in the derived category actually correspond to physical bps d - branes , on any calabi - yau with any moduli .",
    "the generality of this proposal comes with a price , and many of the issues which come up in practice remain to be resolved .",
    "we discuss some of these , and illustrate them with several examples of d - branes on the quintic  threefold .",
    "some of the points we raise were also discussed in @xcite .",
    "other recent work on d - branes on calabi - yau s includes @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps worth emphasizing here that the subjects of the derived category and @xmath0-stability are probably central to an understanding of many aspects of string theory .",
    "while we focus here purely on d - branes , it was observed in @xcite that the derived category , and presumably @xmath0-stability , are fairly unavoidable in the heterotic string .",
    "( see @xcite , for example , for some comments on stability in the classical sense . ) indeed this kind of approach may well be required for the complete study of any yang  mills ( or at least hermitian ",
    "mills ) theory in a stringy context .",
    "in section  [ s : pistab ] we review the basic ideas of the origin of the derived category in the context of d - branes and the appearance of @xmath0-stability . in order to obtained a well - defined notion of stability",
    "we show that the `` octahedral axiom '' of triangulated categories in required .    in section  [ s : eg ]",
    "we clarify the analysis of section  [ s : pistab ] by applying it to the quintic threefold .",
    "this section contains several plots showing the lines of marginal stability of several d - branes .    in section  [ s : mon ]",
    "we show how monodromy manifests itself physically as a result of stability considerations .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : susy ] we discuss an application to the study of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in this section we review and elaborate on the notions of @xmath0-stability for objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves .",
    "the course of logical steps required to understand @xmath0-stability is somewhat complicated so we will try to spell out each step of the argument .",
    "let us begin with the theory of topological b - branes as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the definition of the topological b model is at first sight independent of khler moduli , and at first sight topological b branes will be just the boundary conditions discussed by witten @xcite , associated with holomorphic cycles carrying holomorphic bundles .    however , this is not all of the topological boundary conditions .",
    "this point can be motivated in many ways .",
    "for example , the typical stringy khler moduli space as determined by mirror symmetry has several large volume limits producing spaces of distinct topology ; this leads to several distinct sets of holomorphic bundles , while the complete set of boundary conditions must be the same in all such limits .",
    "there is a natural mathematical construction which , starting from any of these sets ( actually categories ) of boundary conditions , leads to a universal result : to pass from the original category to the derived category .",
    "implicit in kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry proposal @xcite is the claim that topological branes correspond precisely to objects in the derived category .",
    "the more recent proposals of @xcite explain physically how to construct such boundary conditions , and why this generalization is necessary .",
    "initially the boundaries in witten s b - model are taken to be a set of finite - dimensional vector bundles .",
    "we then further distinguish boundary conditions by associating a number @xmath7 known as the `` grade '' , to each possible boundary .",
    "let us denote a bundle associated with a boundary labeled by @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "a topological open string stretching from @xmath10 to @xmath11 then lives in the hilbert subspace @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the intrinsic `` bulk '' ghost number of the open string . at this point",
    "we have used the one - to - one relation between states in topological string theory , ramond ground states in the corresponding physical string ( and thus massless fermions in space - time ) , and to the ( dolbeault ) cohomology of the @xmath14 operator coupled to the bundle @xmath15 .",
    "the total ghost number in the topological field theory is then redefined as follows : an open string between branes with abstract grades @xmath16 and @xmath8 , i.e. in @xmath12 , is _ defined _ to have ghost number @xmath17 .",
    "the wedge product gives us an associative product on cohomology : @xmath18 in topological field theory terms this is the operator product . at this point",
    "we switch to the language of algebraic geometry .",
    "we replace the notion of holomorphic vector bundle with the associated coherent sheaf .",
    "these sheaves , to be thought of as d - branes , together with their morphisms , to be thought of as open strings , form the structure of a category .",
    "this category is in fact an abelian category : this means that every map between sheaves has a kernel and cokernel .",
    "gaining this property is one reason to generalize from bundles to sheaves ; it is only true in this larger context .",
    "physically , the first point at which sheaves enter is in considering the zero size instanton , as explained in @xcite .",
    "thus , the vector bundle @xmath9 is generalized to a sheaf @xmath19 , and the linear vector space @xmath20 becomes the linear vector space @xmath21 .",
    "the next step is to allow objects @xmath22 which are direct sums of objects @xmath9 with different abstract grades @xmath8 , and to allow a brst operator which is a general map @xmath23 of grade @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 .",
    "in other words , each b - brane can be written as a complex of finite length : @xmath26&\\ce^{-1}\\ar[r]^{d_{-1}}&\\underline{\\ce^0}\\ar[r]^{d_0 } & \\ce^1\\ar[r]^{d_1}&\\ldots , } \\label{eq : ecplx}\\ ] ] where the boundary maps @xmath27 represent the various components of the brst operator @xmath28 .",
    "such a generalization respects all of the axioms of topological field theory ; it can be further argued that this generalization is in fact the general ghost number one deformation of the topological field theory @xcite .. at present there is no evidence that this further generalization is required to describe bps states . ] some notations from @xcite are used as follows : an underline in a complex represents the `` zeroth '' position .",
    "also , if @xmath29 is a coherent sheaf then @xmath30 will represent a complex with the only nonzero entry being @xmath29 at the zeroth position .",
    "we also use the conventional notation that @xmath31 $ ] represents the complex @xmath32 shifted @xmath33 places to the _",
    "left_.    we will denote the complex ( [ eq : ecplx ] ) as @xmath32 . note that the original notion of `` grade '' of a sheaf has now become `` position '' in a complex .    as argued in @xcite ,",
    "many complexes correspond to the same topological brane , distinguished by adding brane - antibrane pairs or other combinations of branes which can annihilate to the vacuum . to factor out this redundancy ,",
    "two complexes are taken to represent the same d - brane if and only if they are related by a _ quasi - isomorphism_. this equivalence was explained in a slightly different way in @xcite .",
    "the final result is that topological b - branes are ( up to isomorphism ) in one to one correspondence with objects in @xmath34  the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath1 .",
    "further marginal deformations of the topological field theory of section [ ss : top ] yields nothing new in the sense that the resulting d - branes remain objects in @xmath34 .",
    "given a pair of complexes @xmath32 and @xmath35 together with a chain map @xmath36 , the `` mapping cone '' @xmath37 is defined as an object in @xmath34 given by @xmath38&\\underline{\\ce^1\\oplus\\cf^0}\\ar[r]^{\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}d_e&0\\\\ f&d_f \\end{smallmatrix}\\right ) } & \\ce^2\\oplus\\cf^1\\ar[r]^-{\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}d_e&0\\\\ f&d_f \\end{smallmatrix}\\right ) } & \\ce^3\\oplus\\cf^2\\ar[r]&\\ldots }   \\label{eq : cone}\\ ] ] it was argued in @xcite that this is a general feature of topological d - branes .",
    "namely two d - branes @xmath39 in @xmath34 are marginally deformed by a map @xmath40 into @xmath37 . thus the mapping cone represents the `` sum '' of two branes .    in the simplest case of the mapping cone",
    "we may think of @xmath32 as a the complex given by the single sheaf @xmath41 at position zero and @xmath35 as a the complex given by the single sheaf @xmath29 at position zero .",
    "@xmath42 then yields the mapping cone as a complex : @xmath43&\\ce\\ar[r]^{f}&\\underline{\\cf}\\ar[r]&0 . } \\ ] ]    reversing this construction one may view the complex @xmath26&\\ce^{-1}\\ar[r]^{d_{-1}}&\\underline{\\ce^0}\\ar[r]^{d_0 } & \\ce^1\\ar[r]^{d_1}&\\ldots }   \\label{eq : kom2}\\ ] ] as an iteration of cones : @xmath44    in this way one may view the mapping cone as the basic operation in the construction of complexes .",
    "this leads one to study the structure of the category of topological d - branes as a _",
    "triangulated category_. a triangle in @xmath34 is an sequence of morphisms of the form : @xmath45^w_{[1]}&\\\\ a\\ar[rr]^u&&b\\ar[ul]^v } \\label{eq : tri1}\\ ] ] the `` @xmath46 $ ] '' denotes that the map @xmath47 increases the grade of any object by one . that is , in terms of elements in the complexes , @xmath48 .",
    "there must always be exactly one edge in a triangle with a `` @xmath46 $ ] '' .",
    "this edge may be moved however .",
    "for example , the triangle in ( [ eq : tri1 ] ) could be rewritten as @xmath49\\ar[dl]&\\\\ a\\ar[rr]&&b\\ar[ul]_{[1 ] } } \\label{eq : tri2}\\ ] ]    the triangle ( [ eq : tri1 ] ) in @xmath34 is _ distinguished _ if and only if @xmath50 is isomorphic to @xmath51 .",
    "we refer to chapter 5 of @xcite for further details .",
    "note that because the `` @xmath46 $ ] '' can be shuffled around to any edge of the triangle , any vertex of a distinguished triangle can be considered the mapping cone on the opposing side of the triangle .",
    "this democracy between the vertices of a distinguished triangle can not be over - emphasized .",
    "physically , it means that if two topological d - branes @xmath52 and @xmath53 can combine to give @xmath50 , then @xmath52 and @xmath54 $ ] can combine to give @xmath53 etc .",
    "the exact meaning of this will be become more clear when we talk about physical d - branes below .",
    "we would now like to relate the topological branes above to physical branes .",
    "we show in this section that many of the objects of @xmath34 can represent potential physical d - branes . in section",
    "[ ss : stab ] we will see that they need to satisfy further stability requirements in order to be physical .",
    "let us return to the state of affairs before we introduced the derived category and think of our d - branes as 6-branes wrapped on the .",
    "such a brane is characterized by a choice of vector bundle @xmath22 over @xmath1 : the d@xmath55 charge is the rank of @xmath22 , while the lower d - brane charges are determined by the chern character of @xmath22 .",
    "we will summarize this information in the rr charge vector @xmath56 .",
    "this is a bps state with a particular central change @xmath57 . for an even - dimensional b - brane such as this , @xmath57 depends purely on the complexified khler form , @xmath5 , and not on the complex structure of @xmath1 . for large radius",
    "we have @xcite @xmath58 we may compute @xmath57 exactly by passing to the mirror of @xmath1 as we will see in section  [ ss : xi ] .",
    "the basic physical interpretation of @xmath57 is that @xmath59 is the mass of the bps brane @xmath22 , .",
    "we will not use the normalized masses in our subsequent considerations ; clearly these are also valuable data ( as seen in @xcite ) and it would be interesting to find some way to use them in our considerations . ] while the phase @xmath60 determines the particular @xmath61 supersymmetry which is preserved by the brane @xmath22 .",
    "the phase of @xmath57 plays many roles in the subsequent considerations .",
    "one of the most familiar is in defining walls of marginal stability or `` ms - walls . ''",
    "these are lines of marginal stability , or ms - lines . ]",
    "suppose we have two 6-branes @xmath22 and @xmath62 which might combine to give a bound state @xmath63 .",
    "a well known argument using @xmath64 and the triangle inequality shows that either    * @xmath65 implying @xmath63 is marginally stable for this decay into @xmath22 and @xmath62 , or * @xmath66 and then , assuming @xmath63 exists as a bps state , @xmath63 is stable against this decay .",
    "thus a given decay process can only take space on a specific ( real ) codimension one wall in moduli space , the ms - wall , determined by the charges @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "of course being on the wall is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a decay .",
    "we thus define the `` grade '' of the brane @xmath22 to be @xmath69 while the specific @xmath70 supersymmetry which is preserved by @xmath22 is determined by @xmath71 up to shifts in @xmath72 , we wrote @xmath73 for the phase to emphasize that ( as in @xcite ) we define the grade to take values in @xmath74 , not just @xmath75 , by making a choice of branch for the logarithm .    to better understand this point , consider a pair of inequivalent d - branes whose values of @xmath76 happen to agree at a particular value of @xmath5 . as we vary @xmath5 ,",
    "the difference between the grades of the branes varies continuously with @xmath5 but may exceed 2 even if we remain in a fundamental region of the moduli space . as we argue shortly , this relative grade has physical meaning .",
    "we therefore require a more precise definition of @xmath76 as follows .",
    "fix a basepoint in the moduli space @xmath77 near large radius limit . for a given d - brane use ( [ eq : gradedef ] ) to fix @xmath76 at the basepoint in some fixed range , say , @xmath78 .",
    "now demand that @xmath76 varies _ continuously _ along any path in the moduli space .",
    "this makes @xmath76 a well - defined function on the _ path space _ @xmath79 consisting of paths in the moduli space starting at the fixed basepoint .    this definition fixes most of the ambiguity but not all .",
    "first , there is an arbitrary choice of the phase of the holomorphic three - form ( and thus all the central charges @xmath57 ) at the basepoint .",
    "in fact , shifting @xmath76 for all branes simultaneously by a constant value will be physically meaningless ; only differences @xmath80 will enter our considerations .",
    "second , one wants @xmath76 to be a well - defined function on _ teichmller space _ @xmath81 , which we define as a cover of moduli space on which central charges are single valued , or as the moduli space of mirror quintics carrying a basis of @xmath82 .",
    "this cover should be branched only at singular points , with branchings determined by the monodromies on rr charges . now",
    "all physical quantities should be well - defined functions on such a teichmller space , but in general @xmath71 as we have defined it may not be .",
    "if the central charge @xmath57 vanishes at a non - singular point @xmath83 in moduli space ( this is possible if the brane @xmath22 does not physically exist at @xmath83 ) , paths encircling @xmath83 will shift @xmath71 by @xmath84 .",
    "we will discuss this point in section  [ ss : stab ] , eventually concluding that @xmath71 is well - defined only for stable objects , and that one should consider only paths which remain in the region of stability .",
    "the fundamental physical reason we need to lift @xmath76 to @xmath74 is that variations of the grade ( [ eq : gradedef ] ) determine the variation of the masses of open strings stretched between branes @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the topological open strings discussed above correspond in the physical cft to ramond ground states , each of which will have a ns partner defined using spectral flow .",
    "the @xmath85 superconformal algebra determines the mass of the corresponding space - time boson in terms of its @xmath86 charge @xmath28 to be @xmath87 we then combine this with the result that flow of grading affects the @xmath86 charge of a string between a brane @xmath22 and a brane @xmath62 as @xmath88 in particular , if @xmath22 and @xmath62 are _ neighbors _ in the sense that their grades differ by one , then an element @xmath89 corresponds to a marginal deformation to a new state , the mapping cone @xmath90 .    as we saw in section [ ss : tri ] , we may use the mapping cone to iteratively build long complexes along the lines of ( [ eq : cccc ] ) .",
    "that is one follows the following algorithm .",
    "let us assume that the complex begins with @xmath91 as the leftmost term for simplicity .    1 .",
    "compute @xmath92 and @xmath93 near large radius limit using ( [ eq : lrz ] ) . define them to lie in some fixed range ,",
    "say @xmath78 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "3 .   analytically continue the @xmath76 s of @xmath52 and @xmath53 along a path in the moduli space @xmath77 to find a point where @xmath96 .",
    "4 .   this defines the new object @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "5 .   replace @xmath52 by @xmath97 and @xmath53 by the next term in the complex .",
    "repeat from step 3 until the complex is exhausted .",
    "note that we will have more to say about step 3 at the end of section  [ ss : stab ] .",
    "the property of the grading of the cone with respect to the constituent objects we used in the rules above is justified as follows . referring to equation ( [ eq : tri1 ] ) if we have an open string @xmath100 stretching from @xmath52 to @xmath53 and @xmath96 , then @xmath52 and @xmath53 form a marginally bound state @xmath101 . in this case @xmath102 where recall @xmath52 was viewed as an _ anti_-brane .",
    "viewing @xmath52 as a brane , we have @xmath103 , which implies @xmath104 this equation defines @xmath105 and , in particular , fixes the @xmath72 ambiguity .    in this way",
    "we can hope to build a good many objects of @xmath34 .",
    "an example of a complex which _ can not _ be built is @xmath106 where @xmath29 is any sheaf .",
    "one might claim the first three terms as giving @xmath107 but then the relative @xmath76 of this cone and the second @xmath29 is stuck at 2 for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "this particular object is decomposable ( it is a direct sum of simpler objects ) and as such would not correspond to a single physical brane ; however it is likely that many indecomposable objects in @xmath34 also can not be constructed using the above algorithm .",
    "@xmath0-stability implies that such objects never correspond to physical branes .",
    "this definition of the grade of a complex is somewhat complicated as it requires finding a succession of paths in moduli space , one for each step in the procedure . in special cases",
    "one might be able to simplify this .",
    "for example , one might try to build a complex @xmath26&\\ce^{-1}\\ar[r]^{d_{-1}}&\\underline{\\ce^0}\\ar[r]^{d_0 } & \\ce^1\\ar[r]^{d_1}&\\ldots } \\ ] ] in a single step , by finding a value for @xmath5 for which @xmath108 for all @xmath8 for which @xmath19 is nonzero , and some fixed real number @xmath109 .",
    "however , such a value is not likely to exist if there are more than two nontrivial terms in the complex .      given a point of marginal stability in the moduli space where we have a good picture in terms the topological d - branes",
    ", we may ask what happens if we change @xmath5 slightly to move away from the point .",
    "suppose we consider the system of @xmath22 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 introduced above , with @xmath90 , and move away from a point on the ms - wall .",
    "clearly one of three things can happen :    1 .",
    "@xmath110 implying we remain on the ms - wall .",
    "@xmath111 implying that the open string becomes tachyonic .",
    "this tachyon acts like the ones studied by sen @xcite and binds @xmath22 and @xmath62 together to form @xmath63 .",
    "3 .   @xmath112 .",
    "this forces the grade of the other two maps in the distinguished triangle to go negative , a potential contradiction to the axioms of unitary cft which can only be resolved if @xmath63 is in fact unstable against decay to @xmath22 and @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "thus the grades of the d - branes determine the stability constraints .",
    "this is the `` @xmath0-stability '' of @xcite and is the central issue we study in this paper .",
    "the simplest proposal one could make is that a physical d - brane is an object in @xmath34 which is @xmath0-stable against all possible decays .",
    "note that @xmath34 is a concept from algebraic geometry and , as such , does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the central charges do depend on @xmath5 however and so therefore do the stability conditions .",
    "one might think of the derived category data as solving some `` f - term '' equation of motion and the further @xmath0-stability condition as arising from some `` d - term '' @xcite .",
    "however , this proposal suffers from a problem of self - reference which looks very problematic . in order for @xmath50 to decay into @xmath52 and @xmath53 , both @xmath52 and @xmath53 must actually exist !",
    "a given triangle therefore has little information content :    * if @xmath113 we can not assert that @xmath50 is stable as it may be the vertex of another triangle which allows a decay into other products . *",
    "if @xmath114 we can not assert that @xmath50 is unstable as we have not established the stability of @xmath52 or @xmath53 .    conceptually , the simplest way to deal with this problem is to assume that there is some other way of determining the set of stable objects at a given `` basepoint '' @xmath115 and then try to follow the set of stable objects as we move away from this basepoint .",
    "we define @xmath0-stability as a criterion on the entire set of stable objects @xcite .",
    "this set or list , call it @xmath116 , should be considered as a function on path space .",
    "we furthermore assign a value of @xmath76 ( fixing the mod 2 ambiguity ) to each object in @xmath116 .",
    "the rules above can now be used to determine the entire list @xmath117 at all nearby points @xmath118 given @xmath116 . to be more precise ,",
    "we enumerate the following constraints , to be applied at every point @xmath83 :    1 .   for every distinguished triangle of the form @xmath45_{[1]}&\\\\ a\\ar[rr]&&b\\ar[ul ] } \\label{eq : tri10}\\ ] ] with @xmath119 , @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "2 .   on the side @xmath113 of the ms - wall defined in 1 , we have @xmath121 , with all grades @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath105 determined by continuity .",
    "conversely , for every triangle of the form ( [ eq : tri10 ] ) with @xmath125 and @xmath114 , we have @xmath126 .    to get the definition started , one starts at a base point @xmath127 in moduli space where @xmath116 is known _ a priori_. for example , in the large volume limit",
    ", one might take @xmath116 to be the @xmath128-stable coherent sheaves . of the objects under discussion ) .",
    "it is also possible that one must make some restriction on the types of singularities allowed in these sheaves . ]",
    "one might start from other points as well ; an example we will discuss in more detail below is the orbifold point .",
    "it is a very interesting question as to whether @xmath0-stability can intrinsically determine the set of stable objects without need for other criteria .",
    "we will not attempt to address this problem in this paper .    in the examples",
    ", @xmath116 is an infinite set , so one needs further information to use this definition in practice . for now , let us start by formulating the criterion in a way which is clearly practical , i.e. could be implemented on a computer .",
    "thus , let @xmath28 be a subcategory of @xmath34 consisting of a finite number of objects together with a finite number of morphisms .",
    "there are therefore a finite number of distinguished triangles composed purely of objects and morphisms in @xmath28 .",
    "this allows explicitly checking the rules above , and objects in @xmath116 constructed in this way will be referred to as `` @xmath28-stable '' .",
    "hopefully as @xmath28 is taken to be a larger and larger subset of @xmath34 we get a closer approximation to the truth of whether the corresponding d - brane really exists as a physical object .",
    "there are probably many mathematical subtleties which need to be overcome to make this hope more manifest .",
    "the first criticism one can make of this proposal is that stability , which should be a physical notion , depends on position in the path space @xmath79 rather than the moduli space itself . as we explore in section [ s : mon ] , the physical identity of an object in @xmath34 undergoes monodromy on going around singularities in @xmath77 and so one can not expect the notion of stability of an object in @xmath34 to depend only on the position in @xmath77",
    ". however , one should expect stability to be a function of position in the teichmller space @xmath81 .",
    "that is , a loop in @xmath77 not enclosing anything like a conifold point , gepner point , etc .",
    ", should be trivial and so the notion of stability should not change upon monodromy around this loop .    as we commented earlier , the value of @xmath76 for objects with general charge will be ambiguous on @xmath81 .",
    "however , our rules for stability only use the @xmath76 s of stable objects ; indeed there is no clear physical definition of @xmath76 for an unstable object .",
    "grades of stable objects will be unambiguous on @xmath81 if no path in @xmath129 , the region in which @xmath52 is stable , encloses a zero @xmath130 .",
    "this will be true if we grant two conditions .",

    "we give an example of this effect in section [ ss : x2 ] which we hope will clarify the argument above .",
    "it is well worth comparing the notion of stability for d - branes with similar notions for vector bundles and sheaves .",
    "the familiar notion of a d - brane , before venturing into the complexities of the derived category , is that of a vector bundle @xmath22 supported on @xmath1 on over some subspace of @xmath1 .",
    "the connection on this bundle must satisfy the hermitian - yang - mills equation .",
    "a bundle @xmath22 has a `` slope '' @xmath128 given by @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the khler form .",

    "it is _ semistable _ if the weaker condition @xmath158 holds .",
    "we then have the following theorem due to donaldson , uhlenbeck and yau @xcite    an bundle is stable if and only if it admits an irreducible hermitian - yang - mills connection .",
    "this connection is unique .",
    "as shown in @xcite this stability condition is implied by @xmath0-stability at large radius limit as we now review .",
    "suppose @xmath29 is a subsheaf of @xmath41 .",
    "we then have a short exact sequence @xmath159 for some @xmath160 which yields a distinguished triangle in the derived category in the usual way . near the large radius limit",
    "we may use  ( [ eq : lrz ] ) to show @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the volume of @xmath1 .",
    "the stability condition @xmath157 is then equivalent to @xmath163 . since @xmath164",
    ", we have @xmath165 and so @xmath166 lies between @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "it follows that @xmath157 implies that @xmath169)<1 $ ] and so @xmath170\\to\\cf)$ ] is @xmath0-stable with respect to the triangle associated to ( [ eq : feg ] ) .    comparing this with the earlier discussion of @xmath0-stability ,",
    "the main point of difference is that the coherent sheaves form an _",
    "category : one has a well - defined notion of kernels and cokernels . the statement that `` @xmath29 is a subsheaf of @xmath41 '' is another way of saying that the morphism @xmath171 has no kernel and so the statement depends on the abelian structure of the category .",
    "the derived category of coherent sheaves is not an abelian category and hence has no absolute notion of `` sub - d - brane '' . in checking the stability of a sheaf one has to check for stability only against all subsheaves .",
    "since a subsheaf has a lower rank , this is always a finite process . for d - branes",
    "however there is no such hierarchy of objects such as rank and therefore no analogue of a finite chain of possible decay products . given two d - branes @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,",
    "it is known in examples that @xmath52 can decay into @xmath53 for some values of the khler form , while @xmath53 can decay into @xmath52 for other values , as we will see in subsection 4.1 .",
    "it is this lack of hierarchy between d - branes and their decay products which forces one to use a category which is not abelian , rather than simpler notions such as sheaves .",
    "the arguments we just made do not yet rule out the possibility that in _ specific regions _ of teichmller space , one can reduce the general discussion of @xmath0-stability to stability in an abelian category , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "thus , let us explore the claim that in some region @xmath172 , the @xmath0-stable objects are precisely those objects @xmath22 which satisfy @xmath173 for all subobjects @xmath174 of @xmath22 defined with respect to an abelian category @xmath175 .",
    "it is convenient to impose the further requirement that @xmath175 is a graded abelian category with integer gradings ( as usual ) .    at present , the only known case of a point at which all relative gradings are integer , @xmath176 , is the orbifold point ( for a @xmath177 orbifold singularity ) .",
    "near such an orbifold point , we can use conventional @xmath70 supersymmetric gauge theory to describe all bound states of fractional branes , as has been observed in many works .",
    "we now give physical arguments why this is so , to better understand in what situations this simplification might hold .",
    "consider a combination of fractional branes ; it will fall into one of three classes .",
    "if the central charges of all the branes roughly align , then all tachyonic modes have small masses compared to the string scale , and the conditions for applicability of low energy world - volume field theory are clearly met . on the other hand , if some branes have roughly anti - aligned central charge , we can further distinguish the cases in which a fractional brane and its own antibrane are both present , and the case in which this is not so . in the first case , since the mass of the brane - antibrane tachyon is string scale and much larger than any other scale , the lowest energy configuration clearly will condense this tachyon , leading to brane - antibrane annihilation and a configuration with a simpler description ( in terms of fewer fractional branes ) . in the second case , examination of the orbifold spectrum",
    "shows that there are no brane - antibrane tachyons present , so no possibility for a bound state involving all of the objects .",
    "again , the simple bound states can be described using only branes or only antibranes .    this last point in the argument relies on a condition on the spectrum which holds near the orbifold point but not necessarily for a general collection of branes .",
    "thus the condition that the constituent brane central charges roughly align is necessary but not sufficient for the applicability of supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "the additional condition that the only string - scale tachyons are those between a brane and its own antibrane is sufficient ; we have not established that it is necessary .",
    "having justified the use of supersymmetric gauge theory in a region @xmath178 around the orbifold point , we note that indeed @xmath0-stability reduces to a stability condition in an abelian category in this region ; in fact we have justified the use of @xmath179-stability near the orbifold point as in @xcite , using the category of quiver representations .",
    "we now ask what is the boundary of this region @xmath178 .",
    "the primary constraint is that morphisms @xmath180 of negative degree can only be produced by flow from morphisms of degree zero .",
    "this is clear because we require every decay predicted by @xmath0-stability to correspond to a decay into a subobject .",
    "a sufficient ( but perhaps not necessary ) condition for this is to require that , compared to the orbifold point , @xmath181 for all differences of gradings of objects in @xmath175 .",
    "this condition determines the region @xmath178 around the orbifold point in which the category of quiver representations can be used to define stability . for @xmath182 , its boundary ( within the fundamental region )",
    "is the ms - line on which the d@xmath183-brane becomes stable .",
    "it is easily seen that this stability condition breaks down on the boundary of this region .    within @xmath178 ,",
    "the appropriate notion of stability is a generalized notion of @xmath179-stability , which uses the same definition of subobject , but in which the stability condition @xmath184 for every subobject @xmath185 is replaced by the condition @xmath186 .",
    "the hierarchy between branes and decay products is governed by the total number of fractional branes , which is always decreasing in subobjects ; this number is determined by the charge of an object .    for more general ( compact )",
    "s , there probably does not exist any point in moduli space at which all brane central charges roughly align or antialign .",
    "such points will exist for subcategories of branes carrying a subset of the possible charges , and it would probably be quite useful to analyze the spectrum within these subcategories along the lines which we just described .",
    "let us however continue to discuss proposals which could describe all the branes .",
    "a logical extension of the considerations in this subsection is to try to find a set of regions @xmath187 whose union covers the teichmller space , and corresponding graded categories @xmath188 each appropriate in a region @xmath187 , meaning that within @xmath187 all decays predicted by @xmath0-stability in fact reduce to decays into subobjects as defined within @xmath188 .",
    "if such a picture can be made to work , it would be reasonable to refer to the regions @xmath187 as `` phases , '' as the choice of @xmath188 already tells us quite a lot of information about the bps spectrum .",
    "the simplest proposal for constructing such an abelian category @xmath188 goes as follows .",
    "first , one needs to postulate integer gradings for all of the objects .",
    "the simplest prescription one can make is to take the gradings @xmath71 at a specific point @xmath83 in moduli space and round them off to the nearest integer ; call this @xmath189 .",
    "as long as we make a consistent choice of @xmath189 for each @xmath22 , any choice of rounding will work .",
    "this choice then leads to a definition of integer grading for each morphism ; let @xmath190 be the grading of the morphism @xmath40 .    as in the orbifold example",
    ", we want to arrange things so that all decays predicted by @xmath0-stability in fact proceed through subobjects as defined by exact sequences involving morphisms of grading @xmath191 .",
    "this condition will again define the region @xmath172 in which a given choice of integer gradings can be used .",
    "a potential difficulty with this idea appears at this point , as there is no guarantee that the region @xmath172 so defined will have finite extent .",
    "assuming it does , one then wants to show that this data indeed defines an abelian category ; in particular that morphisms have kernels and cokernels . as mentioned in @xcite , the appropriate framework for this discussion is the formalism of @xmath192-structures",
    "; we hope to return to this in future work .",
    "the analysis of section  [ s : pistab ] is clarified in this section by analyzing various examples of @xmath0-stability in the context of the quintic hypersurface in @xmath193 .      in this section",
    "we review the techniques required from candelas et al @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be the quintic hypersurface in @xmath193 .",
    "the mirror @xmath143 is then a @xmath194 orbifold of a quintic with general defining equation @xmath195 the single complex variable @xmath196 spans the one - dimensional moduli space of complex structures of @xmath143 .",
    "this encodes the mirror of the one - dimensional moduli space of complexified khler forms on @xmath1 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the variable @xmath197 .",
    "the gepner point of the moduli space of @xmath1 is mirror to @xmath198 .",
    "the large radius limit of @xmath1 is mirror to @xmath199 . at @xmath200 ,",
    "one has the `` conifold '' point where @xmath143 becomes singular ( acquiring a conifold point ) .",
    "this is mirror to the fact that the conformal field theory on @xmath1 becomes singular for the corresponding value of @xmath5 .    since @xmath201 , we have 4 independent periods @xmath202 for the holomorphic 3-form @xmath203 .",
    "these periods satisfy the picard - fuchs equation ( see @xcite for a nice account of this ) .",
    "following @xcite we use the following periods given as a power series around the gepner point : @xmath204 we may use @xmath205 as a basis . ) between @xmath206 and @xmath57 has an additional minus sign , and @xmath57 is the complex conjugate of that defined in ( [ eq : lrz ] ) . ]",
    "one may then analytically continue these periods using barnes integral methods to match this basis with series around the large radius limit .",
    "we use the following basis near @xmath199 : @xmath207    @xmath208    @xmath209    @xmath210    these analytic continuations are valid for @xmath211    in each case above the integral is taken along the path corresponding to a straight line from @xmath212 to @xmath213 , where @xmath214 .",
    "the variable @xmath192 above corresponds to @xmath215 for @xmath1 where @xmath216 generates @xmath217 .",
    "the `` mirror map '' determines @xmath192 uniquely as @xmath218 we refer to @xcite , for example , for an account of the history and status of the mirror map .",
    "the above results show that the true stringy complexified khler moduli space @xmath77 of @xmath1 is the @xmath219 with affine coordinate @xmath220 ; the periods are singular or have branch points at the three points mentioned above .",
    "( the gepner point is only an orbifold singularity , and physics is nonsingular there . )",
    "as discussed in section  [ ss : stab ] the stability questions are best thought of in terms of the teichmller space rather than the moduli space . in terms of the `` presentation of data '' we wish to give in this example , we basically have three choices of how to parametrize the khler moduli space :    1",
    ".   we can use @xmath220 ( or @xmath196 ) as above as a parameter on the moduli space . since @xmath220 is not a parameter on the teichmller space ,",
    "the periods and questions of stability will not be a single valued function of @xmath220 .",
    "2 .   we can use the theory of automorphic functions to construct the teichmller space as the upper half - plane as was done in section 2.2 of @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage of presenting the periods as single valued functions .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that this teichmller space appears to be remarkably unphysical .",
    "for example , the real line of the upper half - plane will contain a dense set of copies of both the conifold point and the large radius limit point .",
    "the former are a finite distance from a generic point in the moduli space while the latter are an infinite distance !",
    "this is tied in with problems of notions of t - duality for such string compactifications @xcite .",
    "3 .   we can use @xmath221 as the parameter .",
    "this is the most physical parameter for the moduli space .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that fundamental regions of the moduli space do not `` tile '' the @xmath192-plane leading to multivaluedness as in the @xmath220-plane .",
    "this problem should be clear from the figures in section  [ s : eg ] .",
    "the choice we make in this paper is to go with the third option and use @xmath192 to plot lines of marginal stability .",
    "this is viable because the lines of marginal stability we consider usually remain in the `` '' phase , i.e. , remain on the large radius side of the conifold point .",
    "in this phase , @xmath192 is certainly the most natural parameter .",
    "some of the ms - lines analyzed later in this section venture outside this phase but they do not do unpleasant things such as crossing themselves when plotted in the @xmath192-plane . if such pathologies occur , as they surely do in more complicated examples , it might be easier to visualize the ms - lines in the less physical choice of using the upper half - plane as the teichmller space .      for a  threefold",
    ", an a - type d - brane corresponds to a 3-cycle .",
    "the central charge , @xmath222 , of this d - brane is then given , up to some normalization , exactly by the period associated to this cycle .",
    "the normalization will not concern us since we are only interested in differences in gradings and hence ratios of periods .",
    "we may use this fact , together with the knowledge of section [ ss : quin ] , to determine the exact central charges of b - type branes on the quintic threefold .",
    "given a particular element of @xmath34 we may compute the chern character using @xmath223 equation  ( [ eq : lrz ] ) then determines the large radius behaviour of @xmath224 as a series in @xmath192 .",
    "this is then enough to fix the exact linear combination of @xmath225 s from section [ ss : quin ] which represents the period on @xmath143 and hence the exact form of @xmath224 .    in order to perform this analysis",
    "we need to know precisely what constitutes the `` quantum corrections '' of ( [ eq : lrz ] ) .",
    "these corrections come from two sources :    1 .",
    "nonperturbative corrections : these are of the form @xmath226 for @xmath227 .",
    "perturbative corrections : these are of the form @xmath228 . since these corrections begin at `` four loops '' @xcite , the highest power of @xmath192 appearing will be three less than the leading order ( `` one loop '' ) term .",
    "note therefore that the only effect of the perturbative corrections is to contribute a constant term in ( [ eq : phi3 ] ) .",
    "we claim that this constant term acts to cancel the @xmath229 term in ( [ eq : phi3 ] ) .",
    "one way to justify this is to do a direct computation of the 4-loop term which we have not done .    instead let us use",
    "the fact the the singularity in the conformal field theory associate to @xmath1 at the `` conifold point '' is associated to a d - brane becoming massless .",
    "the monodromy of the periods around the conifold point given by table 3.1 of @xcite immediately implies that the period associated to this d - brane must be @xmath230 .",
    "the analysis of the previous section shows that at large radius this period behaves as @xmath231 using ( [ eq : lrz ] ) and @xmath232 for the quintic we have @xmath233 where @xmath234 represents the 4-loop correction .",
    "since @xmath234 is imaginary ( see @xcite for example ) the reality of @xmath235 confirms our assertion .",
    "furthermore we see immediately that the d - brane that vanishes at the conifold point satisfies @xmath236 .",
    "it is therefore natural to associate it with the structure sheaf @xmath237 as asserted in @xcite .    now that we have fixed this 4-loop term we have an exact method for associating a linear combination of @xmath225 s ( over the rational numbers ) with the central charge of any element of @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore have an exact method of computing the grade @xmath76 of any b - type d - brane on the quintic .",
    "this method should generalize to any example where the picard - fuchs system is understood in the language of generalized hypergeometric functions .    in the examples below we computed @xmath238 numerically by integrating the picard ",
    "fuchs equation with a runge  kutta algorithm .",
    "the initial conditions were specified by using the power series expansions of @xmath225 ( [ eq : varpi ] ) .      as a first example consider the following map @xmath240 ^ -{f(x_i)}&\\o , } \\label{eq : d4-n}\\ ] ] where @xmath241 is a polynomial of degree @xmath239 in the homogeneous coordinates of @xmath193 .",

    "however , by combining physical and mathematical input , one can still derive kontsevich s conjecture .",
    "specifically , we need ( [ eq : psicon ] ) , the action of the monodromy on the chern character , and the statement that the monodromy is an autoequivalence . we will appeal to a result of bridgeland and maciocia @xcite ( section 3.3 ) , which states the following .",

    "by composing the true monodromy associated to the conifold point with the inverse of the fmt ( [ eq : st ] ) , one obtains an autoequivalence which , under our assumptions , is an fmt that preserves the chern character and every point sheaf @xmath312 .",
    "this fmt is covered by the result we just cited with @xmath334 . using the action on the charges to determine @xmath335 , we find that this composition is indeed the identity , establishing the result .",
    "let us turn to some related comments .",
    "it is also instructive to follow @xmath237 as we go around the gepner point five times .",
    "this and its generalizations have been analyzed at the chern character level in papers such as @xcite but not at the derived category level .",
    "monodromy around the large radius limit is trivially achieved by tensoring with @xmath336 .",
    "one may then consider the combined monodromy transform given by @xmath337 for the combined monodromy around the large radius limit and conifold point .",

    "in particular `` 5 times around the gepner point '' is not the identity map on @xmath34 but rather a shift .",
    "a similar result for the elliptic curve was described in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the quintic should extend naturally to any manifold represented as a complete intersection in a toric variety .",
    "it particular , there is a `` primary component of the discriminant locus '' in the moduli space which plays the rle of the conifold point above as discussed by horja @xcite and morrison @xcite and also in @xcite .",
    "monodromy around this will then also be given by the object in ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) .",
    "what about other monodromies for a general  threefold ?",
    "the monodromy around the conifold point arises purely because of the simple zero appearing in @xmath345 .",
    "it is clear then that the arguments above should generalize easily for any case where a single soliton is becoming massless at a given point in the moduli space .",
    "this is characteristic of all `` conifold''-like points as argued in @xcite .",
    "we simply replace @xmath308 by the particular object @xmath346 becoming massless .",
    "this yields @xmath347 as the corresponding object generating the fourier  mukai transform .",
    "it would be nice to establish the more general monodromies discussed by horja @xcite .",
    "let us conclude by briefly describing one possible application of these ideas , namely to finding @xmath70 compactifications of string theory which spontaneously break supersymmetry .    in the general context of compactification with branes ,",
    "a popular way to get supersymmetry breaking is to incorporate combinations of bps space - filling branes preserving different supersymmetries , for example a brane and its antibrane .",
    "one could incorporate non - bps branes for the same purpose .",
    "let us discuss this type of construction in the context at hand of tree level type ii compactification .",
    "as is well known , in this limit bps brane considerations do not depend on the number of minkowski dimensions filled by the branes , so we can apply @xmath0-stability as discussed here to this problem , and say that a compactification will break supersymmetry in this way if the k theory class of the embedded d - branes do not support a stable or semi - stable configuration . by semi -",
    "stable we mean a direct sum of bps branes with aligned central charge , so this is just a rephrasing of the problem .",
    "the value of this rephrasing is that , while it is not hard to find combinations of bps branes which break supersymmetry for a particular value of the  and brane moduli , it is quite hard to find combinations which break supersymmetry for all values of the moduli .",
    "indeed we are not aware of any example in the literature .",
    "since the  moduli are of course dynamical fields in the compactified theory , one must remove supersymmetric vacua at all points in moduli space to truly break supersymmetry .    to give the simplest example of what can go wrong , if one includes a brane and its own antibrane , typically after varying moduli the two will annihilate , leaving a supersymmetric configuration .",
    "this is typically signaled by a tachyon in the spectrum from the start and is thus not so interesting .",
    "many examples are known in which no tachyon is visible in the spectrum , at least for the particular  moduli for which the configuration was constructed , and yet supersymmetry is broken .",
    "we discussed the familiar example of the d@xmath311-d@xmath55 system in section 4 , and the techniques here provide many generalizations of this .",
    "the d0-d6 configuration however does not pass the test of breaking supersymmetry for all values of the moduli ; on the ms - line we exhibited in figure 7 , supersymmetry is restored .",
    "this phenomenon is very generic : for example , any compactification with two types of bps brane would be expected to restore supersymmetry on a wall of real codimension 1 .",
    "this also points to the larger problem , which is that since bps central charges vary drastically with the moduli , an analysis in the neighborhood of some point in moduli space is not at all adequate to address this problem . a global picture is needed .",
    "we note in passing that a consistent string compactification with d - branes must of course include orientifold planes and cancel rr tadpoles , and that one would be particularly interested in finding a brane configuration of this type which breaks supersymmetry . at present",
    "it appears that breaking supersymmetry is the hard part of the problem , while numerous examples of tadpole canceling configurations are known .    using the ideas discussed in subsection 2.6 and in @xcite",
    ", one can see that in the @xmath182 orbifold ( and probably in general @xmath177 orbifolds ) , one can never break supersymmetry in this way . in other words , for every rr charge vector , there is some point in teichmller space @xmath81 at which the configuration is semi - stable , and supersymmetry is restored .    to analyze this problem , it is simplest to express the rr charges in the basis of fractional branes discussed in @xcite . the simplest case to consider is then when all charges in this basis are non - negative , or all are non - positive , as then it is manifest that supersymmetry is restored at the orbifold point : one simply considers the appropriate direct sum of fractional branes , all of which preserve the same supersymmetry .",
    "the result holds even for general charges , because by moving on the teichmller space one can induce a monodromy after which all charges become positive in this basis .",
    "it suffices to consider the monodromy corresponding to @xmath348 for sufficiently large @xmath8 ; by results cited in @xcite the resulting charge vector is @xmath349 for @xmath350 and is manifestly non - negative .",
    "thus there will exist monodromy images of the `` original '' orbifold point at which supersymmetry is restored .    the main ingredient which is needed to get this very general result is that there exist a point in moduli space at which a set of branes forming a basis for the entire derived category of branes ( such as the fractional branes in the orbifold problem ) all have aligned central charges .",
    "as we discussed in subsection 2.6 , this is probably not true for compact , leaving the possibility of supersymmetry breaking by this mechanism open",
