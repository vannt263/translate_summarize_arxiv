    "a very elegant mechanism for obtaining lattice chiral fermions was recently proposed @xcite .",
    "the idea is to start from wilson fermions in @xmath0 dimensions , where @xmath1 is the dimension of space - time , and give these fermions a mass @xmath2 of the order of the cutoff .",
    "however , a domain wall like defect is introduced by making the mass term dependent on the extra dimension , choosing @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 ( @xmath7 labels the coordinates of the extra dimension ) .",
    "it was shown that a massless mode with positive chirality exists in this model @xcite , which is exponentially bound to the defect at @xmath8 , which is identified with @xmath1 dimensional space - time .    in a finite volume",
    "an antidomain wall exists due to the ( anti)periodic boundary conditions , and consequently , a negative chirality mode , bound to this defect , exists ( other choices of boundary conditions are possible , but do not alter the conclusions @xcite ) .",
    "one can study this system coupled to external smooth gauge fields , and one finds that any anomalous charge created on the domain wall by this gauge field is carried off through a goldstone - wilczek current to the antidomain wall @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the coupling to dynamical gauge fields .",
    "a detailed account can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we also refer the reader for notations .",
    "we introduce a waveguide @xmath9 , with @xmath10 on one side , and @xmath11 on the other side of the domain wall . only within the waveguide ,",
    "the fermions are coupled to a dynamical gauge field @xmath12 .",
    "this breaks gauge invariance in the fermion hopping terms across the waveguide boundary , which is restored by promoting these terms to yukawa couplings with a scalar field @xmath13 , which takes values in the gauge group @xmath14 @xcite . for another approach with @xmath7-independent gauge fields ,",
    "the model is defined by the action @xmath15 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & y(\\psb^{s_0 - 1}vp_l\\psi^{s_0 }                     +   \\psb^{s_0}v^{\\dg}p_r\\psi^{s_0 - 1 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & y(\\psb^{s_0'}v^{\\dg}p_l\\psi^{s_0'+1 } + \\psb^{s_0'+1}vp_r\\psi^{s_0'}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the @xmath7-dependent mass .    for @xmath17 the regions inside and outside the waveguide decouple , and new zeromodes appear on one of the waveguide boundaries , with negative chirality just inside , and with positive chirality just outside the waveguide @xcite .",
    "( they appear only at one of the boundaries : which one depends on details . )",
    "the inside mode couples to the gauge field , rendering the theory vectorlike .",
    "the key question now is whether this situation pertains for all values of the yukawa coupling @xmath18 , or that a pms phase exists for large values of @xmath18 @xcite , where the fermion spectrum around the waveguide boundary does not contain light fermion modes .",
    "this phenomenon takes place in a number of higgs - yukawa models , and if this would be the situation in the case at hand , the unwanted modes at the waveguide boundary would decouple .",
    "we emphasize that there are no simple anomaly arguments to rule out this possibility @xcite .",
    "we have studied this question for @xmath19 , as it is the fermion - scalar dynamics that would be responsible for the existence of a pms phase .",
    "this is reasonable , as @xmath12 ( in the landau gauge ) should be close to one in an asymptotically free theory . at @xmath17",
    "the action can be diagonalized , and one finds two massless dirac modes , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the right(left)-handed mode at the ( anti)domain wall , and @xmath23 is the left(right)-handed mode just inside ( outside ) the waveguide boundary . these modes all have a chiral spectrum for momenta in the region @xmath24 around @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "modes with momenta outside this region are delocalized in @xmath7 , and their wavefunctions are negligible at the domain walls and waveguide boundary .",
    "this includes all species doubler momenta @xmath26 _ etc_. in writing an effective action for the light modes , we may therefore ignore these large @xmath27 modes .",
    "we will also ignore the yukawa couplings of the domain wall modes ( @xmath28 ) , since their wavefunctions are exponentially suppressed at the waveguide boundaries .",
    "this leads us to an effective model for @xmath29 and @xmath30 :    @xmath31    this form of the effective action is reminiscent of a hypercubic higgs - yukawa model @xcite , in that in both models the yukawa couplings are suppressed for large momenta .",
    "this leads to the suspicion that no pms phase will exist in our model , as no such phase exist in the hypercubic model .",
    "the obvious thing for a numerical investigation , in order to find out whether a pms phase exists or not , is to compute fermion masses .",
    "however , in particular for large @xmath18 and small scalar hopping parameter @xmath32 ( the region of interest @xcite ) , the propagators become very small and noisy due to the strongly fluctuating scalar field , and we have not been able to compute reliable fermion propagators in that region ( we mostly used the quenched approximation ) .",
    "we studied the eigenvalue spectrum of the dirac operator for the effective action , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and compared it with @xmath34 higgs - yukawa models which are known to have or lack a pms phase .",
    "the distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane is a very good measure of the existence of the pms phase @xcite .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "1 , indicating that indeed no pms phase exists .",
    "= 5 cm    we have also computed the @xmath30 mass in the broken phase ( _ i.e. _ for large @xmath32 ) of the full model ( eq . ( 1 ) ) , where the signal to noise ratio is better , again for @xmath35 and @xmath34 .",
    "( for a discussion of the finite volume @xmath34 scalar phase structure , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) results for the @xmath32 dependence are shown in fig . 2 for strong yukawa coupling @xmath36 , which are consistent with the weak coupling behavior @xmath37 for @xmath38 . near a fm - pms phase transition one",
    "would have expected a fermion mass increasing with @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "again , this indicates that no pms phase exists in our model .",
    "we conclude with some remarks , most of which are more extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "@xmath40 we have tried unquenched computations , which resulted in very poor statistics , and very low acceptance rate of the hybrid mc algorithm . unquenched results were not inconsistent with our quenched computations .",
    "@xmath40 the scalar field is nothing else than the longitudinal gauge field , and it is due to the fluctuations of this field that the model produces mirror fermions , rendering the model vectorlike : both @xmath41 and @xmath42 couple to the gauge field .",
    "@xmath40 a crucial role is played by the  effective momentum cutoff \" @xmath43 , which is critical in removing the doublers .",
    "however , from eq .",
    "( 2 ) it is also clear that this cutoff plays an important role in the ( non)existence of a pms phase .",
    "@xmath40 we have also considered a staggered fermion formulation of the domain wall approach , based on the notion that in that case no @xmath43 appears . however , in this case , the flavor structure causes similar problems @xcite .",
    "@xmath40 there exists a proposal to keep the volume in the extra dimension strictly infinite @xcite , based on the idea that in that way the zeromode on the antidomain wall is avoided from the start .",
    "@xcite discusses a possible relationship between this approach and the one reported on here",
