    "understanding the physical processes that drive the growth of super - massive black holes ( smbhs i.e. , active galactic nuclei ; agn ) and how this relates to the growth of their host galaxies ( i.e. , star formation ) , is an ongoing challenge of observational and theoretical astronomy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk of star formation and black hole growth occurred at high redshift ( i.e. , @xmath2@xmath61 ) and most observational work of high-@xmath2 galaxies , suggests that the star - formation rates ( sfrs ) of agn hosts are broadly consistent with the overall star - forming population",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the _ average _ black hole growth rates of high-@xmath2 massive galaxies do appear to be correlated with average sfrs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these combined results potentially indicate a common fuelling mechanism for both processes , but with the agn activity varying on much shorter timescales than the star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately these and similar studies have been limited to spatially - unresolved measurements of the star formation , such as those provided by _",
    "( e.g. , fwhm@xmath36.5@xmath0 at 100@xmath1 m ) or scuba-2 ( e.g. , fwhm@xmath314.5@xmath0 at 850@xmath1 m ) .",
    "these measurements hide crucial information on the star formation spatial distribution and surface densities of star formation .",
    "arguably the best tracer of star formation in high-@xmath2 galaxies is rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) emission ( @xmath13@xmath381000@xmath1 m ) .",
    "this emission is due to dust that has been heated by young stars inside star - forming regions ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . for agn host - galaxies",
    "there is some discussion about the contribution of star formation versus agn activity as the source of heating for fir - emitting dust ( e.g. , see @xcite ; @xcite ) ; however , providing direct size measurements of the emission provides a useful constraint on this issue ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . in the era of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , it is now possible to rapidly build up large samples of high-@xmath2 galaxies with accurate measurements of the angular sizes of the rest - frame fir emission , and consequently to constrain the spatial distribution and surface density of star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such work builds on previous sub - arcsecond resolution interferometric continuum observations of a small number highly - selected high-@xmath2 sub - millimetre galaxies ( smgs ) and agn ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "comparing the spatial distribution of star formation in agn to non - agn host galaxies of uniformly - selected samples will provide important information on the feeding and feedback processes involved in smbh accretion ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .    in this letter we present high - resolution ( fwhm=0.3@xmath0 ) alma 870@xmath1 m continuum measurements of @xmath2@xmath31.54.5",

    "this is based on alma data from a programme that was designed to obtain sensitive sfr measurements ( or upper limits ) for x - ray agn ( @xcite ;  [ sec : methods ] ) . here",
    ", we place constraints on the sizes of the rest - frame fir emission in high-@xmath2 x - ray agn host galaxies and hence measure the spatial distribution and surface density of star formation in these sources (  [ sec : extended ] ) .",
    "we compare to equivalent alma observations smgs , to assess if and how agn activity in high-@xmath2 star - forming galaxies is related to sfr surface density (  [ sec : discussion ] ) . throughout",
    ", we adopt @xmath14mpc@xmath5 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the data presented in this letter are from a cycle1 band7 alma programme to obtain 870@xmath1 m continuum measurements of @xmath2@xmath171.5 x - ray detected agn that were selected to be pre - dominantly faint or undetected in _ herschel _ measurements .",
    "thirty agn were targeted that were selected from the _ chandra_-deep field south ( cdf - s ; @xcite ) , to have x - ray luminosities of @xmath18@xmath1710@xmath19ergs@xmath5 .",
    "the details of how the sample was constructed are provided in @xcite ; however , we note that they only include 24 sources in their study due to specific constraints on the redshifts and stellar masses . here",
    "we exploit _ all _ of the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) detections from these data , including serendipitous detections ( see below ) .",
    "the 30 primary targets were split into three groups containing 7 , 11 and 12 targets each .",
    "the first two groups were observed in two observing blocks , whilst the third group was observed once .",
    "the array configuration contained 26 alma antennae , with a maximum baseline of 1300 m and median baselines of @xmath3200 m .",
    "the observations are sensitive to a maximum angular scale of 46@xmath0 , at which we expect to recover all of the rest - frame fir - emission ( see @xcite ) . each target was observed using 7.5ghz of bandwidth , centred on 351ghz ( i.e. , @xmath3870@xmath1 m ) , with on - source exposure times of 2.57min .",
    "all measurement sets have a full compliment of calibrator observations ( amplitude , phase and bandpass ) .",
    "full details of the observations and data reduction will be presented in stanley et  al .",
    "( in prep ) .",
    "the data were processed using the common astronomy software application ( casa ; version 4.4.0 ; @xcite ) and imaged using the clean routine provided by casa .",
    "we used the most recent version of the alma data reduction pipeline to calibrate the raw data .",
    "however , the calibrated data were then visually inspected and , where appropriate , we repeated the pipeline calibration including additional data flagging . to image the data , we largely follow the methods described in detail in @xcite and",
    "so we only provide brief details here .",
    "we created two sets of images : ( 1 ) `` detection images '' ( fwhm@xmath30.8@xmath0 ) and ( 2 ) `` high - resolution images '' ( fwhm@xmath30.3@xmath0 ) .",
    "for both sets of images we initially create `` dirty '' images and identify emission detected with snr@xmath175 .",
    "we then place a tight clean mask around the emission from the source and iteratively clean down to 1.5@xmath20 within these regions .",
    "finally , we measure the noise in the cleaned image , and repeat the cleaning process around snr@xmath174 sources .    for the detection images , we applied natural weighting and a gaussian taper , resulting in synthesised beams of ( 0.8@xmath00.9@xmath0)@xmath70.7@xmath0 . the noise of the final cleaned images have a range of @xmath21=0.100.25mjybeam@xmath5 . to create the high - resolution images we used briggs weighting ( robust parameter = 0.5 ) to obtain synthesised beams of ( 0.3@xmath00.4@xmath0)@xmath70.2@xmath0 .",
    "these final cleaned images have a noise of @xmath21=0.070.18mjybeam@xmath5 .",
    "we searched for alma sources that are detected within the primary beam of the high - resolution images with _",
    "peak _ snrs@xmath69 . above this detection threshold",
    "we can make measurements of the continuum sizes in these images and compare directly to the smgs with equivalent measurements in @xcite ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) . across all of the images we obtain six sources , with peak snrs@xmath69 ,",
    "of which three are primary x - ray agn targets for this programme ( @xcite ) , two are serendipitous x - ray agn and one is a serendipitous source which is not x - ray detected ( table  1 ) .",
    "this low alma detection rate of the primary agn targets is driven by a selection which prioritised agn with low _",
    "fir fluxes and a discussion of this is provided in @xcite . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we compare our detected sources to smgs with similar fluxes and luminosities .",
    "the alma detection images and high - resolution images for these six targets are shown in figure  [ fig : maps ] .",
    "peak flux densities are measured directly from the images ( calibrated in units of jybeam@xmath5 ) .",
    "total flux densities are measured using high - resolution images that are converted to jypixel@xmath5 and 1@xmath0 diameter apertures .",
    "we note that we obtain consistent flux measurements if we use the detection images ( i.e. , agreement within 20% in all cases and a median ratio between measurements of 1.0 ) .",

    "we derive total infrared luminosities ( @xmath13=81000@xmath1 m ) by fitting seds to the available _ spitzer _ , deblended _ herschel_-pacs ; deblended _ herschel_-spire and alma photometry ( i.e. , @xmath13=16@xmath1m870@xmath1 m ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "the details of the sed fitting routine and the compilation of the non - alma photometry are detailed in @xcite . briefly , the fitting routine finds the best fit sed from normalising various combinations of empirical star - formation templates and an agn template , taking into account photometric data points , uncertainties , and upper limits . using the best - fit seds we derived total infrared luminosities , @xmath27 , due to star formation only ( i.e. , subtracting off any identified agn contribution ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) . in two cases ( id:156 and",
    "id:276 ) there are no _",
    "spitzer _ or _",
    "herschel _ detections and therefore we use the alma measurement only .",
    "we believe that the alma photometry is well described by emission due to star formation because , based on a range of agn templates ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , there would be a bright _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath1 m detection if it was agn dominated .",
    "furthermore , in the other four cases the seds indicate that the alma photometry is dominated by star formation ( e.g. , fig  [ fig : sed ] ; stanley et  al . in prep ) .",
    "finally , we assess if the sub - mm fluxes could have a contribution from radio synchrotron emission .",
    "only three of our sources ( 156 , 344 and 305[s ] ) are detected in the deep 1.4ghz radio imaging of @xcite ( typical sensitivity of 7.4@xmath1jy per 2.8@xmath0 by 1.6@xmath0 beam ) .",
    "the flux densities are 88@xmath1jy , 83@xmath1jy and 41@xmath1jy , respectively , which are over an order of magnitude lower than the alma flux densities ( e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : sed ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the alma photometry has negligible contribution from synchrotron emission .",
    "we have compiled a sample of five x - ray agn , and one serendipitous target , with high snr alma 870@xmath1 m continuum detections in our high - spatial resolution images ( fwhm@xmath30.3@xmath0 ) . for the redshifts of our targets",
    "these data cover rest - frame far - infrared wavelengths of @xmath3150330@xmath1 m . in this section",
    "we assess if this emission is extended and measure intrinsic ( deconvolved ) sizes .",
    "we are specifically interested in comparing to the redshift - matched ( @xmath2=15 ) smgs with alma 870@xmath1 m sizes presented in @xcite .",
    "these alma observations were taken at the same resolution as those presented here ( i.e. , fwhm@xmath30.3@xmath0 ) and we can derive directly comparable size measurements .",
    "we also refer briefly to @xcite who make size measurements of smgs ; however , they focus on higher redshift sources , typically have lower spatial resolution data and employ different methods to this study .",
    "we make use of both the raw visibility data and our cleaned images to search for extended continuum emission in the alma data and measure sizes for our six sources .",
    "firstly , we explore the raw visibilities by assessing how the amplitude of the data change as a function of @xmath28 distance .",
    "increasing @xmath28 distance corresponds to smaller angular scales .",
    "therefore , a point source has a constant amplitude across all @xmath28 distances and an extended source has a _ decreasing _ amplitude as a function of increasing @xmath28 distance ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . for each target",
    "we align the phase centre of the data to the position of the alma source and then extract the visibility amplitudes , binning across the @xmath28 distance in steps of 100k@xmath13 , and calculating the error on the mean in each bin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] ) .",
    "data ) . however , we obtain consistent results if we model and subtract all other 5@xmath20 sources before extracting the visibilities . ]",
    "we model the amplitude-@xmath28 data with : ( 1 ) a constant amplitude ( applicable for point source emission ) and ( 2 ) a gaussian ( applicable for a gaussian distribution of emission ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath28 data and our fits are shown in figure  [ fig : maps ] . in all six cases the amplitudes",
    "are better described as decreasing , rather than constant , with @xmath28 distance .",
    "the @xmath29 values between the two fits range from 19255 . using the bayesian information criterion ( @xcite ) , which takes into account the number of parameters in each fit ,",
    "these values indicate strong evidence in favour of the gaussian model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to measure the intrinsic far - infrared sizes of our targets we follow the same methods as those presented in @xcite .",
    "that is , we use the imfit routine in casa to fit an elliptical gaussian model ( convolved with the synthesised beam ) to the 870@xmath1 m emission in our high - resolution images ( see @xcite and @xcite for various tests of this routine ) . in all cases imfit returns spatially - resolved fits , in agreement with our conclusions based on the @xmath28 data above .",
    "the fits are a good description of the data and show reduced residuals compared to point source model fits , as shown in figure  [ fig : maps ] .",
    "we quote the sizes ( major axes ) and uncertainties returned by casa in table  1 and plot them in figure  [ fig : sizes ] . for comparison , we derive sizes from gaussian fits to the @xmath28-amplitude data ( fig .  [",
    "fig : maps ] ; following e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "these values assume symmetry and will be systematically low compared to elliptical fits of the images ( see @xcite ) ; however , these @xmath28 sizes agree within 13@xmath20 of the image - derived sizes , with a median ratio of fwhm@xmath30/fwhm@xmath31=0.9 , in agreement with that found by @xcite for smgs .",
    "we perform two further tests to verify there is extended emission in our six sources and that our size measurements are reliable .",
    "firstly , we compare the peak and galaxy - integrated fluxes in the high - resolution images .",
    "we find @xmath32/@xmath33=0.490.74 .",
    "these ratios indicate extended structure since a point source would have a peak flux density equal to the total flux density .",
    "finally , we compare the peak flux densities in the detection images to those in the high - resolution images and obtain ratios of @xmath32/@xmath34=0.560.82 .",
    "this drop in flux is strong evidence for emission that is more resolved at higher resolution .",
    "these ratios agree within 120% of the predicted values we obtain by taking out best imfit models and convolving them with the appropriate beams .",
    "this places further confidence on our size measurements described above .",
    "we have identified extended 870@xmath1 m emission in the @xmath351.54.5 host galaxies of five x - ray agn ( see figure  [ fig : maps ] ) .",
    "the measured intrinsic ( i.e. , deconvolved ) sizes are fwhm=0.2@xmath00.5@xmath0 and correspond to projected physical sizes of @xmath313kpc , with a median value of 1.8kpc ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sizes ] ) . we have used infrared seds to show that our alma photometry is consistent with star - forming seds ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) and consequently we attribute this rest - frame fir emission ( i.e. , @xmath3150330@xmath1 m ) to dust heated by star formation .",
    "furthermore , the observed spatial extent of the fir emission on @xmath361kpc scales is challenging to explain with dust that is heated directly by agn without any contribution from star formation .    in figure  [ fig : sizes ] we compare our fir size measurements with the @xmath2@xmath315 smgs from the uds field that were observed with alma by @xcite and one serendipitous star - forming galaxy from our data .",
    "these sources have a similar redshift range to our x - ray agn and have available fir luminosities that are calculated following similar infrared sed analyses to those we applied to our agn .",
    "crucially , the size measurements are obtained from equivalent observational data sets and by using the same techniques as applied here .",
    "@xcite present results for 23 smgs for which they have high snr alma detections , and hence reliable size measurements .",
    "they stack the data for a further 25 sources which have lower snr detections ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sizes ] ) .",
    "these smgs are not identified as x - ray agn based on the x - ray coverage of this field ( @xcite ) .",
    "this x - ray data coverage is relatively shallow ; however , very deep studies in cdf - s find the x - ray agn detection rate of alma - identified smgs to be @xmath320% ( @xcite ) and will make a minor contribution to the overall smg sample .",
    "the median intrinsic fir size of the smgs is fwhm@xmath370.3@xmath0@xmath38 , with a corresponding median physical size of 2.4@xmath390.2kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the sizes of the rest - frame fir emission of our x - ray agn host galaxies , are consistent with the typical sizes of smgs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sizes ] ) .",
    "four of the most luminous smgs ( with @xmath40l@xmath12 ) have very large sizes of 46kpc .",
    "our sample of x - ray agn do not reach these high fir luminosities and due to the low number of targets , we can not conclude anything significant about the lack of very large sizes in our agn sample .",
    "to derive sfr surface densities we follow @xcite .",
    "that is , we convert infrared luminosities to sfrs , following @xcite ( converting to a chabrier imf ) , and assume a uniform surface density with a radius of fwhm/2 ( see tracks in fig .  [",
    "fig : sizes ] ) .",
    "we obtain sfr surface densities of @xmath320200@xmath8yr@xmath5kpc@xmath9 , similar to the subset of smgs with comparable fir luminosities to our sample ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "these results provide evidence that the kpc - scale star formation distribution and surface densities of high-@xmath2 star - forming galaxies are independent of the presence of an x - ray agn .",
    "this implies that the physical mechanisms driving the star formation ( see discussion in @xcite and @xcite ) are similar in these two populations .",
    "we note that our agn have sfrs of @xmath3130400m@xmath12yr@xmath5 , stellar masses of @xmath3(220)@xmath710@xmath41m@xmath12 and corresponding specific sfrs of @xmath3120gyr@xmath5 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these values are similar to smgs of comparable luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however , they may represent the high end of the ( s)sfr distribution of x - ray agn ( see @xcite ) .",
    "herschel_-160@xmath1 m imaging , @xmath42 x - ray agn typically have larger rest - frame fir sizes than our high-@xmath2 samples , reaching sizes of fwhm@xmath3530kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we caution that these results are based on low - resolution data , leading to some sources with upper limits on the measured sizes . these local agn have a wide range of sfr surface densities , covering @xmath62.5dex , with the majority of values being low ( i.e. , @xmath430.1m@xmath12yr@xmath5kpc@xmath9 ) compared to our high-@xmath2 x - ray agn .",
    "these local agn have similar x - ray luminosities to our sample ( a proxy for black - hole accretion rate ) , but typically much lower fir luminosities ( a proxy for sfr ; i.e. , @xmath10@xmath310@xmath4410@xmath45l@xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the star formation sizes and surface densities appear to be insensitive to the presence of an x - ray agn .",
    "@xcite recently reached a similar conclusion for local galaxies that host optical agn using _ herschel _ data .",
    "in contrast , extreme sfr surface densities are only associated with the most extreme star - forming galaxies ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sizes ] ) , which may provide evidence for different fuelling mechanisms ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that all of these measurements hide information of @xmath461kpc structures .",
    "although this study is limited to sources with fir luminosities of @xmath47[15]@xmath710@xmath11l@xmath12 , we now have a first - order assessment of the size scale of the star formation that has been measured for high-@xmath2 x - ray agn by _ herschel _ studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these _ herschel _ studies have shown that the average sfrs appear to be broadly independent of agn luminosity , which trace instantaneous black - hole accretion rates .",
    "these results may not be surprising because the star formation appears to be occurring on scales of a few kpc , orders of magnitude larger than the immediate vicinity of the black hole .",
    "indeed , local studies have shown a tighter correlation between nuclear sfrs , compared to @xmath61kpc - scale sfrs , and black hole accretion rates ( @xcite ) . by collating large samples of spatially - resolved alma data of high-@xmath2 galaxies",
