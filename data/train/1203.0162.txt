    "a desirable property of a model for social behavior , or for complex systems in general , is the presence of a nontrivial steady state characterized by infinitely many equilibrium points in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this was the main appeal of the mean - field spin - glass models used widely since the 1980s to study associative memory @xcite , prebiotic evolution @xcite , ecosystem organization @xcite , and social systems @xcite to name just a few of the areas impacted by the spin - glass approach to model complex systems @xcite .",
    "models of social dynamics , however , are typically defined through the specification of the dynamic rules that govern the interactions between agents @xcite and so they are not amenable to analysis using tools borrowed from the equilibrium statistical mechanics of disordered systems . nevertheless , the display of a steady state characterized by a multitude of locally stable and spatially inhomogeneous configurations remains a celebrated feature of this class of models , whose paradigm is axelrod s model @xcite , since they can explain the diversity of cultures or opinions observed in human societies .",
    "axelrod s model is attractive from the statistical physics perspective because it exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition which separates the spatially homogeneous ( mono - cultural ) from the heterogeneous ( multicultural ) regimes @xcite .",
    "more recently , a long - familiar model of lattice statistical physics  the majority - vote model @xcite  was revisited in the context of social dynamics models @xcite .",
    "in fact , the majority - vote model is a lattice version of the classic frequency bias mechanism for opinion change @xcite , which assumes that the number of people holding an opinion is the key factor for an agent to adopt that opinion , i.e. , people have a tendency to espouse opinions that are more common in their social environment .",
    "the variant of the majority - vote model considered in those studies includes the state of the target site ( the voter ) in the reckon of the majority ( hence we refer to the model as extended majority - vote model ) , which happens to be the variant originally proposed in the physics literature @xcite . this fact is the sole responsible for the existence of an infinity of heterogeneous absorbing configurations whose statistical properties were thoroughly studied via simulations in the case of a two - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "moreover , the non - linearity of the transition probabilities resulting from the inclusion of the voter opinion in the majority reckoning makes the model not exactly solvable , in contrast to the voter model for which the transition probabilities are linear @xcite .",
    "many interesting variants of the one - dimensional majority - vote model were considered in the literature .",
    "for instance , some variants separate the individuals in groups of fixed sizes and apply the majority - vote rule to update the opinion of the entire group simultaneously @xcite .",
    "others differentiate the groups a priori by introducing a group - specific bias used to determine the group opinion in case of ties @xcite .",
    "another variant of interest is the non - conservative voter model for which the probability that the voter changes its opinion depends non - linearly on the fraction of disagreeing neighbors @xcite .",
    "in particular , this variant reduces to the model we study in this paper in the case the voter changes opinion solely when confronted by a unanimity of opposite - opinion neighbors .",
    "all these variants of the majority - vote rule model were studied via simulations or within the single - site mean - field framework , except for the non - conservative variant which was examined within the pair approximation as well @xcite . here",
    "we show that the single - site and the pair approximations yield incorrect predictions for all statistical measures of the steady states and argue that the 3-site and 4-site approximations yield the exact results for measures involving up to three contiguous sites of the chain .    in this contribution",
    "we study analytically the one - dimensional version of the extended majority - vote model , which is described in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "our goal was to understand how the multiple - cluster steady state of the model could be described within the mean - field approach ( sect .",
    "[ sec : mean ] ) .",
    "we find that the signature of the ergodicity breaking is the appearance of an infinity of attractive fixed points in the mean - field equations for the @xmath2-site approximation with @xmath9 .",
    "the characterization of the mean - field steady state requires the complete analytical solution of the dynamics in order to obtain the mapping between the statistical properties of the random initial configurations and those of the final absorbing configurations , except for the 2-site or pair - approximation for which we find a simple shortcut to that mapping , as described in sect .",
    "[ subsec:2 ] .",
    "the full solution of the dynamics was obtained for the @xmath8 and @xmath5-site approximations in sects .",
    "[ subsec:3 ] and [ subsec:4 ] , respectively .",
    "we find that these two approximation schemes yield the very same expressions for the steady - state expectations involving three contiguous sites [ see eqs .",
    "( [ 3.06 ] ) , ( [ phi_3 ] ) and ( [ psi_3 ] ) ] and so we conjecture that those expressions are exact .",
    "a perfect fitting of the simulation data by those predictions adds further support to this claim .",
    "in addition we find that the steady - state expectations involving four contiguous sites calculated within the 4-site approximation fit the simulation data perfectly .",
    "however , this approximation fails to describe higher order expectations .",
    "the agents are fixed at the sites of a ring of length @xmath0 and can interact with their nearest neighbors only .",
    "the initial configuration is chosen randomly with the opinion of each agent being specified by a random digit @xmath10 or @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . at each time",
    "we pick a target agent at random and then verify which is the more frequent opinion ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) among its extended neighborhood , which includes the target agent itself .",
    "the opinion of the target agent is then changed to match the corresponding majority value .",
    "we note that there are no ties in the calculation of the preponderant opinion since the extended neighborhood of any agent comprises exactly @xmath8 sites . as a result ,",
    "the update rule of the model is deterministic ; stochasticity enters the model dynamics through the choice of the target site and in the selection of the initial configuration .",
    "the update procedure is repeated until the system is frozen in an absorbing configuration .",
    "variables in a ring with @xmath14 sites . the inner circle ( black )",
    "is an absorbing configuration of the extended majority - vote model with @xmath15 .",
    "there are 92 clusters and the largest cluster comprises 19 sites .",
    "the outer circle ( blue ) shows a random configuration with the same density of 1 s .",
    "the total number of clusters is 255 and the largest one comprises 9 sites . ]    although the majority - vote rule or , more generally , the frequency bias mechanism for cultural change @xcite is a homogenizing assumption by which the agents become more similar to each other , the two - dimensional version of the above - described model does exhibit global polarization , i.e. , a non - trivial stable multicultural regime in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "this regime should exist in the one - dimensional version as well , since any sequence of two or more contiguous 1 s ( or 0 s ) is stable under the update rule .",
    "it should be noted that for the more popular variant of the majority - vote model , in which the state of the target site is not included in the majority reckoning , and ties are decided by choosing the opinion of the target agent at random with probability @xmath16 , the only absorbing states in the thermodynamic limit are the two homogeneous configurations @xcite . as mentioned before , the inclusion of the target site in the calculation of the majority is actually the original definition of the majority - vote model as introduced in refs .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] illustrates an absorbing configuration of the extended majority - vote model together with a random configuration with the same density of 1 s .",
    "the larger number of clusters ( domains ) observed in the random configuration is due to the possibility of isolated sites , which are unstable under the majority - vote rule .",
    "as usual , we represent the state of the agent at site @xmath17 of the ring by the binary variable @xmath18 and so the configuration of the entire ring is denoted by @xmath19 . the master equation that governs the time evolution of the probability distribution @xmath20",

    "in this section we study the one - dimensional extended majority - vote model using the well - known mean - field @xmath2-site approximation ( see @xcite ) . the basic idea behind the @xmath2-site approximation is to rewrite the distribution @xmath20 in terms of elementary joint probabilities of @xmath2 contiguous sites",

    "this procedure will be illustrated in the next subsections for @xmath40 to @xmath30 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , except for the single - site approximation @xmath40 , the states of any two sites are statistically dependent variables regardless of their positions in the ring .",
    "this is the simplest mean - field scheme which assumes that the state of the agents at different sites are independent random variables so that @xmath41 and so it is only necessary to calculate the one - site distribution @xmath42 to describe the dynamics completely .",

    "[ fig:7 ] . following the already observed pattern ,",
    "we find a perfect agreement with the simulation data for quantities whose calculation involves expectations of up to 4 contiguous sites .",
    "although the main purpose of this contribution is to show the remarkably good predictions of the @xmath8 and @xmath5-site approximations to describe the steady - state properties of the extended one - dimensional majority - vote model , here we focus on the discussion of those properties rather than on the procedure to derive them .",
    "+    figure [ fig:5 ] presents the probability of an absorbing configuration exhibiting a cluster of length @xmath165 as function of the fraction of @xmath10s in the random initial configuration .",
    "the @xmath8-site approximation does not provide a good quantitative account of the simulation data but it does provide an excellent qualitative picture which captures the change of @xmath300 from unimodal to bimodal that takes place for @xmath301 . as for the @xmath5-site approximation , it provides a very good quantitative representation of the simulation data .",
    "in fact , the fitting is perfect for @xmath284 only , but the discrepancies are so small for @xmath302 that they are barely visible in the scale of the figure .",
    "we note that the transition of the distribution @xmath303 from unimodal to bimodal was expected .",
    "in fact , long clusters should be abundant for initial configurations with @xmath12 close to @xmath10 or @xmath11 and very rare when the number of 1s and 0s is well balanced as for @xmath294 .",
    "what is surprising is that the transition occurs for relatively large @xmath165 , indicating , for example , that it is more likely to find clusters of length 10 by starting with a balanced initial configuration than with an unbalanced one .",
    "our simulations indicate that the transition from unimodal to bimodal takes place at @xmath304 already for @xmath305 .",
    "in addition , the distribution of cluster lengths is unimodal for @xmath306 for all @xmath307 .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the dependence of @xmath303 on @xmath165 for fixed @xmath12 .",

    "the distribution is given by the sum of two exponentials [ see eqs .",
    "( [ p3cl2 ] ) and ( [ p4cl2 ] ) ] that account for the different possibilities of occurrence associated to clusters composed of 1s and 0s for @xmath309 . for @xmath294",

    "clearly , for @xmath310 clusters composed of 1s are dominant for small @xmath165 whereas clusters of 0s dominate in the large @xmath165 regime .",
    "the slopes of the exponentials are complicated functions of @xmath12 , which can be well - approximated by eq .",

    "[ fig:6 ] shows @xmath300 for randomly assembled configurations which is given by @xmath311    the failure of the @xmath5-site approximation in describing all the steady - state properties of the extended majority - vote model is better appreciated when we consider the 2-site correlations , as shown in fig.[fig:7 ] .",
    "as already pointed out , the correlations @xmath312 , @xmath313 and @xmath314 are described perfectly by both the 3 and 4-site approximations since they involve expectations of two and three contiguous sites only , so fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] exhibits the more challenging correlations , @xmath315 ( left panel ) and @xmath316 ( right panel ) .",
    "the @xmath5-site approximation describes perfectly the former correlation but not the latter , whereas the @xmath8-site approximation fails in both cases .",
    "it is interesting that in all cases the 2-site correlations exhibit a peak at @xmath294 .",
    "this can be explained by noting that the dynamics takes longer to freeze into one of the absorbing configurations for the well - balanced initial conditions which results in highly correlated sites . on the other hand , for @xmath12 close to its extreme values ,",
    "most sites are already part of frozen random clusters formed during the assemblage of the initial configuration and so most of the sites at the final configuration are uncorrelated .",
    "figure 7 shows , in addition , that the quality of the approximation improves with increasing @xmath2 , as expected .",
    "for example , estimation of @xmath316 using the 3-site approximation ( dashed curve ) yields disastrous results , but the results obtained with the 4-site approximation ( solid curve ) are reasonable .",
    "we note that as @xmath2 increases the estimation of statistical measures involving @xmath317 sites is improved .",
    "in fact , the relative error resulting from use of the 3-site approximation to estimate @xmath315 at @xmath294 is 22.5% whereas the error due to use of the 4-site approximation to estimate @xmath316 is 11.5% only .",
    "the extended one - dimensional majority - vote model is perhaps the simplest lattice model to exhibit an infinity of absorbing configurations .",
    "this strong ergodicity breaking is probably the reason that the model is not exactly solvable @xcite . from the mean - field theory perspective , which was the main focus of our paper , the nontrivial nature of the steady state of the model presented a most stimulating challenge as the usual fixed - point equations proved quite uninformative .",
    "in fact , the solution to the problem is a one - to - one mapping between the randomly assembled initial configurations , which are described statistically by the density @xmath12 of sites in state 1 , and the absorbing configurations . that mapping was obtained directly in the case of the pair approximation but in the case of the @xmath8 and @xmath5-site approximations we had to solve analytically the dynamics for arbitrary @xmath3 and then take the asymptotic limit @xmath6 in order to extract the mapping between the initial conditions and the steady state .",
    "although the pair approximation describes qualitatively the mapping between @xmath12 and the statistical properties of the steady state , its predictions regarding expectations involving two or more contiguous sites are not corroborated by the simulation results ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the 3-site approximation , however , produces a remarkable good fitting of the simulation data for all quantities involving the expectation of three contiguous sites .",
    "moreover , the predictions of the @xmath5-site approximation reduce to those of the @xmath8-site in the case of three contiguous sites expectations .",
    "we see this as a strong indication that the expectations @xmath318 , @xmath319 and @xmath320 given by eqs .",
    "( [ 3.06 ] ) , ( [ phi_3 ] ) and ( [ psi_3 ] ) are exact results . in addition , the perfect fitting of the simulation data by the expectation @xmath321 , calculated within the @xmath5-site approximation [ see eq .",
    "( [ 4.26 ] ) ] indicates that this quantity may be exact as well , but this evidence is not so strong as for the 3-site expectations .",
    "the findings summarized above as well as a purely numerical analysis of the @xmath322 and @xmath323-site approximations ( data not shown ) reveal a most remarkable pattern : the @xmath2-site approximation seems to yield the exact results for steady - state expectations involving @xmath2 contiguous sites for @xmath324 . we hope our paper will motivate further research to prove ( or disprove ) this assertion .    the work of j.f.f . was supported in part by conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico ( cnpq ) and p.f.c.t .",
