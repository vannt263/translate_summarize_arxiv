    "the cosmological acceleration strongly indicates that the present day universe is dominated by smoothly distributed slowly varying dark energy ( de ) component  ( see @xcite for reviews ) , for which the state parameter @xmath1 is negative is usual notation for the pressure to energy ratio . ] .",
    "contemporary experiments give strong support that currently the state parameter @xmath1 is close to @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "the specified domain of @xmath4 covers three essentially different cases : @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the most exciting possibility would be the case @xmath7 corresponding to the so called phantom dominated universe . in phenomenological models describing this case the weak energy conditions @xmath8 are violated and there are problems with stability at classical and quantum levels  @xcite .",
    "thus , a phantom becomes a great challenge for the theory while its presence according to the supernovae data is not excluded .    a possible way to evade the stability problem for",
    "a phantom model is to yield the phantom as an effective model of a more fundamental theory which has no such problems at all .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that such a model does appear in the string theory framework .",
    "this de model assumes that our universe is a slowly decaying d3-brane which dynamics is described by the tachyonic mode of the string field theory ( sft ) .",
    "the notable feature of the sft description of the tachyon dynamics is a non - local polynomial interaction @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it turns out the string tachyon behavior is effectively described by a scalar field with a negative kinetic term ( phantom ) however due to the string theory origin the model is stable at large times .",
    "in @xcite we have found an exactly solvable stringy de model in the friedmann universe .",
    "this model is a modified version of the effective sft model @xcite and is inspired by supersft calculations @xcite .",
    "first level calculations in the sft give fourth order polynomial interaction .",
    "higher levels increase a power of the interaction .",
    "exactly solvable model has a particular six order polynomial interaction potential .",
    "however , small fluctuations of coefficients in that potential do not change the solution qualitatively and one can say that the model @xcite represents the behavior of nonbps d3 brane in the the friedmann universe rather well .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the dynamics of the model in the presence of the dark matter .",
    "this is a subject of the present paper .",
    "it turns out from the observational data that de forms about 73% and the dark matter forms about 23% of our universe .",
    "thus because of a significance of the dark matter component in the universe in the present paper we investigate an interaction of the phantom matter considered in @xcite with the cdm .",
    "it seems impossible to find exact solutions in the presence of the cdm , except the case when the de state parameter is a constant @xcite , so we use numeric methods to analyze the behavior of the phantom field and cosmological parameters in our model .",
    "we start by recalling the main facts related to the model considered in @xcite .",
    "this is a model of einstein gravity interacting with a single _ phantom _ scalar field in the spatially flat friedmann universe .",
    "since the phantom field comes from the string field theory the string mass @xmath9 and a dimensionless open string coupling constant @xmath10 emerges .",
    "the action is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath13 is a spatially flat friedmann metric @xmath14 and coordinates @xmath15 and field @xmath16 are dimensionless .",
    "hereafter we use the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 for short : @xmath18 if the scalar field depends only on time , i.e. @xmath19 , then independent equations of motion are @xmath20 here dot denotes the time derivative , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are energy and pressure densities of the de respectively .",
    "one can recast the system ( [ eomprho ] ) to the following form @xmath24 besides of this there is an equation of motion for the field @xmath16 which is in fact a consequence of system ( [ eomprho ] ) .",
    "following the superpotential method @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we assume that @xmath25 is a function ( named as superpotential ) of @xmath26 : @xmath27    this still does not give a systematic way to find general solutions to the system ( [ eom ] ) but allows one to construct @xmath28 and @xmath29 for a known function @xmath26 .",
    "we take for @xmath26 @xmath30 this function is known to describe effectively the late time behavior of the tachyon in the 4-dimensional flat case @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath26 satisfies the following equation @xmath31 hence , we obtain @xmath32 and corresponding potential @xmath33 we have omitted an integration constant in ( [ ourw ] ) to yield an even potential  ( [ ourv ] ) .",
    "it is typical that to keep the form of solutions to the scalar field equation in the presence of friedmann metric one has to modify the potential adding a term proportional to the inverse of the reduced planck mass @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the described solution leads to a number of cosmological consequences .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath35 goes asymptotically to @xmath36 when @xmath37 goes to infinity .",
    "once @xmath25 is known one readily obtains the scale factor @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an arbitrary constant , and the deceleration parameter @xmath40    it follows from formula ( [ deceleration ] ) that the universe in this scenario is accelerating .",
    "the expression for the state parameter is the following @xmath41 point @xmath42 corresponds to an infinite future and therefore @xmath43 as @xmath44 .",
    "plots for the hubble , deceleration and state parameters are drawn in fig.[plots ] ( hereafter we assume @xmath45 for all plots ) .",

    "now we are going to couple in a minimal way a pressureless matter of energy density @xmath49 ( the cdm ) to our model such that the friedmann equations get an extra term @xmath50 and the equation describing the evolution of scalar field has previous form @xmath51    from ( [ eom - cdm])([eomphi2order - nm ] ) we obtain the conservation of the energy density for the cdm : @xmath52 that after integration gives @xmath53 where constants @xmath54 and @xmath39 are initial values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 correspondingly . from ( [ rho ] )",
    "we obtain equation ( [ eom - cdm ] ) in the following form : @xmath57    following the lines of @xcite we address to our analysis the questions of cosmological evolution and stability .    the straightforward way to study a stability of solutions to the system of equations ( [ eom - cdm])([eomphi2order - nm ] ) is to exclude @xmath55 from ( [ eom - cdm]),([eom - cdm2 ] ) and obtain the following system : @xmath58 depending on the initial values of @xmath59 , @xmath16 and @xmath60 , which have been considered as independent , this system describes our model either with or without the cdm . in particular , the initial values : @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 correspond to the exact solution ( [ kinkphi ] ) .",
    "either one can perform calculations using nonautonomous system of equations @xcite which can be obtained from equations ( [ eomphi2order - nm ] ) and ( [ eom - cdm - expl ] ) in the following form @xmath64 where @xmath65      in  @xcite we have analyzed the system ( [ eom - cdm])([eomphi2order - nm ] ) without the cdm under condition @xmath45 and found that the exact solution @xmath66 is stable with respect to small fluctuations of the initial conditions if and only if @xmath67 .",
    "let us consider the behavior of the solution of system ( [ phi2order])([hequ ] ) in the neighborhood of the exact solution @xmath68 substituting @xmath69 in ( [ phi2order ] ) and ( [ hequ ] ) we obtain in the first order of @xmath70 the following equations : @xmath71 \\displaystyle \\dot\\psi_1 & \\displaystyle=&\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{m_p^2}\\left(2(2m_p^2 - 1)-\\frac{6m_p^2 - 1}{\\cosh(t)^2}\\right ) \\phi_1-{}\\\\[2.7mm]&\\displaystyle -&\\displaystyle \\frac{(2\\cosh(t)^2 + 1)\\tanh(t ) } { 2m_p^2\\cosh(t)^2}\\psi_1-\\frac{3}{\\cosh(t)^2}h_1,\\\\[3.7 mm ] \\displaystyle \\dot h_1&\\displaystyle = & \\displaystyle \\frac{\\tanh(t)}{4m_p^2\\cosh(t)^4}\\displaystyle \\left(1+(2 - 4m_p^2)\\cosh(t)^2\\right)\\phi_1+{}\\\\[2.7 mm ] & \\displaystyle + & \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2\\cosh(t)^2}\\psi_1 -\\frac{(1 + 2\\cosh(t)^2)\\tanh(t)}{2\\cosh(t)^2}h_1.\\\\ \\end{array } \\label{equeps}\\ ] ]    system  ( [ equeps ] ) has been solved with the help of the computer algebra system maple . the exact dependence @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath25 are too cumbersome to be presented here .",
    "the main result is that for @xmath74 functions @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath75 are bounded functions and our exact solution is stable .",
    "note that numerical calculations show that if @xmath67 then even for large initial values of the cdm energy density numerical solutions tend to the exact solution as @xmath37 tends to infinity .      at this point",
    "we pass to numeric methods because it seems impossible to find exact solutions in the presence of the cdm . to analyze the cosmological evolution it is instructive to plot phase curves for the scalar field as well as evolution of the state parameter @xmath1 for the scalar matter .",
    "in addition we find numerically a ratio of the energy densities for the cdm and the de .",
