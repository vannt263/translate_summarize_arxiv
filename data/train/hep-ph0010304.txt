    "these are ambiguities related to the selection of the observables of some particular process . for example , from the cp asymmetry @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( e.g. @xmath8 )    [ 1e ] a_f(t ) = 1-|_f|^2 1+|_f|^2 mt - 2_f 1+|_f|^2 mt +    one can measure ( q p |m m ) | q p |m m | but not ( twofold discrete ambiguity ) .    a possible solution for this kind of ambiguities is to look for processes where the decay products decay weakly , violating parity , like    [ 2e ] b^0_d , |b^0_d ( t ) |",
    "p^-|p^+    here , the more complex lorentz structure ( spin @xmath9 of the @xmath10 ) plus parity violation in the decay allow to reach more observables than in the former case , and one can in principle measure @xcite both @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "as another example of incomplete experimental information that amounts to discrete ambiguities , let us quote the decay @xmath6 , @xmath13 .",
    "looking at the time - dependent angular distributions one can measure some correlations , but not all possible correlations .",
    "the observables that can be reached are , in terms of transversity amplitudes @xcite  :    [ 3e ] & & |a_0(t)|^2,|a_(t)|^2,|a_(t)|^2 , a_(t)a^*_0(t ) , + & & a_(t)a^*_0(t),a_(t)a^*_(t )    recently , chiang and wolfenstein @xcite have pointed out that observing the lepton polarization ( i.e. muon polarization , in practice ) , one can reach the missing observables    [ 4e ] & & a_(t)a^*_0(t ) , a_(t)a^*_0(t ) , + & & a_(t)a^*_(t )    although ref .",
    "@xcite concerns time - integrated processes , the argument is general since the time - dependence and the angular dependence factorize @xcite .",
    "the argument follows from the fact that the quantities ( [ 3e ] ) are pt even , while the quantities ( [ 4e ] ) are pt odd .",
    "these are the ambiguities that arise from the interpretation of the observables within a theory .",
    "one can consider : 1 ) the standard cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa model as the main candidate , where one has three angles ( @xmath14 ) , or 2 ) as an example of physics beyond the standard model , the standard model plus the possibility of a new physics ( np ) phase in the @xmath6-@xmath15 mixing @xcite , i.e.    e^2i_d ( q p)_sm [ 5e ]    in this case one has still three angles ( @xmath16 )        but not always ( @xmath17 ) form a triangle .",
    "this is a nice example of model ( a devil s advocate ) that exhibits the type of ambiguities that one can have without contradicting the unitarity of the ckm matrix . in the @xmath6,@xmath18 experiments one actually measures @xcite the quantity @xmath19 .",
    "there are two general theorems , formulated by grossman and quinn @xcite and recently reexamined by kayser and london @xcite    3 truemm    \\(i ) if ( @xmath20 ) are measured [ e.g. @xmath21 in @xmath22 ignoring penguins , @xmath19 in @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath25 , there is a 64-fold ambiguity for ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , but there is only a two - fold ambiguity if the angles form a triangle .",
    "the remaining ambiguity can be solved by the measurement of @xmath28 or @xmath29 , or other quantities @xcite .",
    "note that although @xmath30 does not violate cp , its measurement from @xmath31 exploits direct cp - asymmetries .",
    "3 truemm    \\(ii ) if ( @xmath32 ) are measured [ e.g. @xmath33 in @xmath34 ignoring penguins ] , there is a 64-fold ambiguity for ( @xmath16 ) , but a single solution if the angles form a triangle .",
    "3 truemm    in practice , the conditions in which the hypotheses of the above theorems are satisfied need some word of caution : were it not for penguin contributions , the result ( i ) would possibly be implemented in the long run , while ( ii ) is virtually impossible because , for experimental reasons , @xmath35 is extremely difficult to measure , even assuming that penguins are negligible in @xmath34 .",
    "one can interpret the data in terms of the theoretical schemes quoted above , but assuming that only some quantities are available experimentally with relatively small errors .",
    "one interesting result in this case is the following @xcite  : if ( @xmath36 ) are known ( @xmath37 ) all ambiguities are solved knowing @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) .",
    "while @xmath38 , @xmath42 ) can in principle be obtained in a model - independent way , @xmath40 , @xmath43 ) can only be obtained in a model - dependent way , for which some hadronic hypotheses are necessary .                        where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the modulus and phase of the ratio of penguin over tree amplitudes for the mode @xmath55 .",
    "there is no rigorous theoretical scheme that allows to calculate these quantities . if one assumes factorization   in the heavy quark limit . ] and knows @xmath58 , then one can have an indication on @xmath52 .",
    "this method uses the decay chain @xmath60 .",
    "the interferences in the dalitz plot allow to obtain @xmath61 and @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "there is however an irreductible contamination from penguins , that behave in the same way as current - current operators , @xmath63 .",
    "however , since the former are perturbatively suppressed and one wants only the @xmath64 , the method is reasonably safe",
    ". one can avoid penguin contributions by considering the decay @xmath65 , up to the price of yet poorly known @xmath66 resonances .        where f(s ) ~y_j^0 s - m_r^2 + i ( s ) is the breit - wigner for the decay of @xmath74 or @xmath75 and the amplitudes @xmath76 , @xmath77 correspond to @xmath78 emission and to @xmath79 emission respectively .",
    "to obtain @xmath80 one has to change the sign of both the @xmath53 , @xmath81 terms .",
    "the parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the strong phase @xmath84 are given by          two modellings of these decays by the orsay group @xcite ( using factorization , isgur - wise functions from the bakamjian - thomas formalism and decay constants from lattice qcd ) , and the trieste group @xcite ( using an effective lagrangian satisfying both chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry ) show that the contribution of @xmath62 to the time - dependent asymmetry is large enough to be identified .",
    "in the @xmath88 decay chain there are angular correlations that , together with the time - dependence , allow to measure @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) @xcite , where @xmath91 are strong phases between the transversity amplitudes .",
    "these strong phases prevent the measurement of @xmath92 . however , in the case of the @xmath93 system , due to the sizeable lifetime difference , there are new terms that can be measured , of the form _",
    "i where , in the su(3 ) limit , @xmath91 are the same strong phases than in the @xmath88 case .",
    "the cp phase @xmath94 , of @xmath95 , can be measured independently , and then @xmath96 can be known and hence @xmath85 .",
    "su(3 ) symmetry is a good enough hypothesis since one wants only the @xmath97  @xcite .",

    "for @xmath134 the effect is very much suppressed by cp violation while @xmath135 for the semileptonic decay @xmath136 .",
    "however , the method suffers from the fact that the semileptonic branching ratio is small .",
    "the situation is critically improved using @xmath100 regeneration in matter . in this case , a term proportional to @xmath62 exists even for @xmath137 , that is proportional to the regeneration parameter , and one can use the dominant decay mode @xmath138 . to measure @xmath58 one would need a high luminosity @xmath104-factory , of the order of 300 - 600 fb@xmath139 .",
    "the general idea in this case is to use angular correlations between the @xmath141 and @xmath142 decay planes to determine the helicity amplitudes in the decay @xmath143 .",
    "the situation is similar , although in a different region of the dilepton invariant mass , to the well - known case @xmath144 @xcite where some of the angular correlations allow to measure the product @xmath145 , where @xmath84 is a strong phase difference between transversity amplitudes . in the case examined in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lepton pair being of pure electromagnetic origin , there is no strong phase and therefore one can in principle measure @xmath62 .

    "unfortunately , the benchmark decay mode for this angle , namely @xmath146 , suffers from small branching ratio on the experimental side  @xcite , and of penguin contributions on the theoretical side  @xcite .",
    "the isospin analysis of all two - pion decay channels could in principle disentangle penguin effects and allow the extraction of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however such a study is very challenging experimentally speaking  @xcite , and is plagued by high - order discrete ambiguities  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that estimating from theory the modulus of the penguin - to - tree ratio with an uncertainty of @xmath14730% at the amplitude level may be competitive with the isospin analysis , while being much simpler .",
    "recent work on factorization in the heavy quark limit",
    "@xcite suggests that such an estimation is within the reach of our understanding .",
    "let us recall briefly the basic elements .",
    "the time dependent cp - asymmetry  ( [ 1e ] ) of the decay is written as a_(t)&=&a_mt + & -&2_mt where @xmath148 is the direct cp - asymmetry while @xmath149 is an observable that reduces to @xmath150 in the absence of penguins .",
    "the decay amplitude is parametrized as a(b_d^0^+^-)=e^it+e^-ip where the usual phase convention for the ckm matrix is used , and where the `` tree '' amplitude @xmath151 receives contributions from the dominant tree diagram as well as @xmath152-type and @xmath153-type penguin topologies , while the `` penguin '' amplitude @xmath154 receives contributions from @xmath155-type and @xmath153-type penguins .",
    "we also define the final state interaction ( fsi ) phase @xmath156 .",
    "is calculated from the theory .",
    "similarly , eq .  ( [ m2 ] ) leads to two solutions for @xmath158 if @xmath84 is calculated from the theory .",
    "if both @xmath157 and @xmath84 can be estimated with sufficient precision , then in general only one value of @xmath158 will satisfy both eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and  ( [ m2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the last discrete ambiguity @xmath160 can be lifted by looking at the sign of @xmath161 , thanks to the equation [ m3 ] ( ) ( ) = ( a _ )    recently , it has been argued that non - leptonic decays factorize in the heavy quark limit of qcd  @xcite , which should allow to compute the hadronic matrix elements in a model - independent way , up to @xmath162 corrections . assuming for the moment that @xmath163 is known , this formalism might give explicit predictions for the parameters @xmath157 and @xmath84 .",
    "the procedure of how we get the angle @xmath1 in practice is shown on figs .",
    "( [ fig1])-([fig3 ] ) .",
    "let us now `` forget '' the value of the theoretical parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath163 and the qcd matrix elements ) that we have used , in such a way that we are only left with the knowledge of the two observables @xmath166 and @xmath169 : hopefully this will be the case in a near future .",
    "the question we would like to answer is how we could extract the value of @xmath1 from the above observables . to this end , we plot the contours defined by eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and  ( [ m2 ] ) in the @xmath170 and @xmath171 planes on figs .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) and  ( [ fig2 ] ) respectively .",
    "note that these contours are completely model - independent .    from @xmath165 and factorization in the heavy quark limit",
    ", we find @xmath159 : this value is reported on the contours of fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , and four solutions for @xmath158 are determined in this way .",
    "of course we have neglected both experimental and theoretical errors , and it remains to be investigated with which precision @xmath158 can be extracted from this approach .",
    "the uncertainty on the ckm angle depends on the experimental errors and the theoretical error on @xmath157 .",
    "similarly , factorization predicts @xmath167 , the value of which is reported on fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) : this allows to select two possible values for @xmath158 .",
    "one sees that only one value for the ckm angle is compatible with both the calculated @xmath84 and @xmath157 ( the one corresponding tp the upper dot in both figures , with @xmath172 ) . the remaining @xmath173 ambiguity is lifted as indicated above by using eq .",
    "( [ m3 ] ) and @xmath174 and @xmath175 : we are left with a single value of the cp angle , @xmath164 , i.e. the value that we had as input for the calculation of the observables .    the fact that redundant information contained in @xmath157 and @xmath84 eliminates spurious solutions can be viewed in a different way : eliminating @xmath1 between eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and  ( [ m2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath176 as a function of @xmath157 , the contour of which is drawn on fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "any estimation of @xmath177 should fall precisely on one of the branches : provided the various sources of error are controlled , this plot may constitute a good test of the theory . in case of a disagreement",
    ", this may be an indication of either the failure of the hadronic calculation , or new physics .",
    "note that the knowledge of the ratio @xmath163 is likely to be affected by still large uncertainties at the time where the cp experiments give first data . actually , once the standard model is assumed , it is possible to express both @xmath1 and @xmath163 in terms of the wolfenstein parameters @xmath178 and @xmath133 , and solve directly the whole problem as contours in the @xmath179 plane  @xcite .",
    "this shows that with the help of the theory , the angle @xmath1 can be determined without any discrete ambiguity in the general case . of course , beside experimental uncertainties that will give some `` width '' to the contours of figs .",
    "( [ fig1])-([fig3 ] ) , we have to handle the theoretical errors associated with the calculation of @xmath157 and @xmath84 , which both receive perturbative and non - perturbative @xmath162 corrections : the former are in principle calculable order by order in perturbation theory , while the latter may be much more difficult to control  @xcite .",
    "we have briefly reviewed part of the great theoretical progress concerning the determination of @xmath0 , and re - examined the extraction of the angle @xmath1 in light of the recent qcd - based work on non - leptonic @xmath104-decays into two light mesons .",
