    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) consist of a late - type star or degenerate dwarf transferring matter to a neutron star or black hole via an accretion disk .",
    "the mass donor generally fills its roche lobe . the optical emission in lmxbs",
    "is usually dominated by reprocessing in the x - ray heated disk . however , in those systems with late - type donors and wide ( @xmath5 d ) orbits , the infrared luminosity of the donor is comparable to that of the disk , allowing direct study of the donor .",
    "the infrared emission is also less affected by interstellar absorption , which is generally a significant hindrance in optical studies of lmxbs .",
    "the most luminous known lmxb mass donor is v2116 oph , the m5 iii giant companion of the 2 min accretion - powered pulsar gx 1 + 4 ( glass & feast 1973 ; davidsen , malina , & bowyer 1977 ; chakrabarty & roche 1997 , hereafter cr97 ) .",
    "the system is exceptional in a number of ways .",
    "it is a symbiotic binary ( see kenyon 1986 and iben & tutukov 1996 for reviews ) , the only one known with a confirmed neutron star companion .",
    "its binary period is unknown but must be @xmath6 d , making it the widest known lmxb by an order of magnitude .",
    "the dense emission line nebula surrounding the binary is powered by ultraviolet radiation from an accretion disk .",
    "dramatic 100% variability on a time scale of minutes was observed in the optical emission fluxes of selected and lines , while the continuum and all other lines remained constant ( cr97 ) .",
    "coherent optical pulsations at the 2-min x - ray pulsar period are intermittently detected in the broadband blue continuum ( jablonski et al .",
    "gx 1 + 4 ( = 4u 1728247 ) is one of brightest hard x - ray sources in the galactic center region .",
    "x - ray timing of the pulsar has revealed remarkable bimodal accretion torque transitions between long intervals of steady , rapid spin - up and equally rapid spin - down ( chakrabarty et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this may indicate that the dipole magnetic field strength at the neutron star surface is extraordinarily strong ( @xmath7 g ) , or that the accretion disk alternates between states of prograde and retrograde rotation and is fed by the red giant s wind rather than by roche lobe overflow ( makishima et al .",
    "1988 ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997 ; nelson et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we report here on infrared observations of the gx 1 + 4/v2116 oph binary . besides characterization of the infrared spectrum of v2116 oph , one of our primary goals was to exploit the bright infrared emission from the star to search for the rapid emission line variability reported by cr97 in the optical .",
    "an unanticipated result of our observations was the detection of a fast outflow from the m giant , which has important implications in understanding the mass transfer in this binary .",
    "we observed v2116 oph on 1995 may 10 using the new near - infrared long - slit spectrometer ( larkin et al .",
    "1996 ) at the @xmath8 cassegrain focus of the palomar observatory 5-m hale telescope .",
    "the two available gratings yield wavelength resolutions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , when used with a 0.7 arcsec slit width .",
    "we made two types of observations : relatively long exposures ( several pulsar periods ) to get time - averaged spectra of the object , and rapid time sequences to look for time variability in selected emission lines .",
    "for the long exposures , five @xmath11 spectra were taken .",
    "these included four 1-min observations at different grating angles to cover the entire @xmath12 bandpass ( 2.02.4 @xmath0 m ) , and a 2-min observation within the @xmath13-band , centered on the 1.2818 @xmath0 m ( paschen @xmath4 ) line .",
    "also , a high resolution ( @xmath14 ) spectrum of the 1.083 @xmath0 m line was obtained with a total integration time of 6 min .",
    "all of the observations were made in pairs using a 0.75@xmath1540 arcsec slit .",
    "the first exposure of a pair was taken with the target 10 arcsec from one end of the slit , and the target was then moved 20 arcsec along the slit for the second exposure .",
    "the spectra were reduced by subtracting image pairs and then dividing by a sky - subtracted standard star frame .",
    "bad pixels were removed by linear interpolation . to remove a slight curvature along the spatial axis , a star was moved in 5 arcsec intervals along the slit and its position was fit with a third - order polynomial . for all our observations ,",
    "the seeing was @xmath16 arcsec at 2 @xmath0 m , and the sky was photometric .",
    "a nearby star was simultaneously observed with an offset guider which controlled a tip - tilt secondary . with this guiding system in place ,",
    "tracking errors ( @xmath170.1 arcsec ) were insignificant compared to the seeing .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved by fitting atmospheric oh airglow emission lines with a quadratic polynomial .",
    "we obtained the oh line wavelengths from oliva & origlia ( 1992 ) and maihara et al .",
    "a conservative estimate of the absolute wavelength calibration uncertainty is roughly one pixel , corresponding to 70 km s@xmath2 for @xmath11 and 15 km s@xmath2 for @xmath10 .",
    "this includes the systematic uncertainty due to curvature of the spectral lines and the line fitting procedure .",
    "the observed wavelengths of v2116 oph were corrected for the earth s motion with respect to the solar system barycenter .",
    "air wavelengths are quoted for all spectral features discussed in this paper .",
    "the flux calibration was performed in the following way .",
    "for the relative calibration , we used observations of the g3 iv standard star hr 6441 , for which we assumed a blackbody temperature of 5725  k. as we only observed through a narrow slit , absolute calibration using hr 6441 was not possible .",
    "instead , we normalized our spectra to the typical infrared photometric magnitudes of v2116 oph , which have been fairly constant over the 1990s except during the bright x - ray flare of 1993 september ( cr97 ) .",
    "the time variability of the pa@xmath4 and 1.083 @xmath0 m lines was investigated by obtaining 6 sequences of time - resolved spectra of each line .",
    "each sequence consisted of 8 exposures with an integration time of 8 s. due to overhead in reading out and storing the data , exposures were actually separated by 14.43 s , and the total duration of a sequence was 115.455 s ( close to the 2 min pulse period of gx  1 + 4 ) . between sequences ( i.e. , every 2 min ) , the object was moved to the opposite end of the slit , as described above .",
    "the sequences were reduced in pairs , with the average spectrum of one sequence being used for the sky subtraction of the individual spectra in the other . for each line ,",
    "a total of 48 exposures ( each 8 seconds long ) was obtained , covering a total time span of about 1000 seconds .",
    "the resolution was @xmath11 for the pa@xmath4 spectra and @xmath10 for the 1.083 @xmath0 m spectra .",
    "figure  1 shows our combined @xmath12-band spectrum of v2116 oph .",
    "in addition to strong 2.1655 @xmath0 m ( brackett @xmath18 ) emission and absorption band features due to @xmath19co and @xmath20co , there are several weaker absorption features due to neutral metal species .",
    "the 2.06 @xmath0 m line may also be detected in emission , but telluric contamination shortward of 2.1 @xmath0 m prevents a secure identification .",
    "the spectrum longward of 2.1 @xmath0 m is similar to one obtained contemporaneously from ukirt ( at somewhat lower resolution ) by bandyopadhyay et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on 1995 june 29 . except for the br@xmath18 emission line ,",
    "both observations are consistent with the spectrum expected from an isolated late - m giant ( kleinmann & hall 1986 ) . comparing our co absorption band measurements with the synthetic spectra of lazaro et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , we estimate that the [ c / h]@xmath21 and @xmath19c/@xmath20c@xmath22 .",
    "the latter quantity is consistent with an independent estimate of @xmath19c/@xmath20c@xmath23 by bandyopadhyay et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . by comparison ,",
    "both single m giants and m giants in symbiotics generally have carbon relative and isotopic abundances somewhat below the solar value ( lazaro et al .",
    "1991 ; schild , boyle , & schmid 1992 ) .",
    "time - resolved emission line photometry of the pa@xmath4 and lines showed no evidence for the dramatic 100% variability on a 10 min time scale previously reported for some optical and emission lines ( cr97 ) .",
    "the two lines showed fractional root - mean - squared variations of about 15% , which is consistent with poisson counting statistics .",
    "we folded the ir spectrophotometric data at the x - ray pulse period of the neutron star ( 122.169 s on 1995 may 10.44 ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997 ) to look for coherent pulsations .",
    "no pulsations were detected in either the emission lines or the continuum .",
    "the 2@xmath24 upper limits on the pulsed fractions were @xmath25% for the line and @xmath26% for the adjoining continuum , and @xmath27% for the pa@xmath4 line and @xmath25% for the adjoining continuum .",
    "for comparison , pulsation searches in optical emission lines set upper limits of @xmath28% ( 3@xmath24 ) in h@xmath29 ( krzeminski & priedhorsky 1978 ) and @xmath30% in 8446  ( deutsch , margon , & bland - hawthorne 1997 ) .",
    "however , optical pulsations from v2116 oph have been intermittently detected in the broadband blue continuum with 2% amplitude ( jablonski et al .",
    "since the pulsed fraction of the x - ray emission is known to be high ( @xmath31% ) , the absence of pulsations in the emission lines is consistent with the conclusion of cr97 that the emission lines are powered by ultraviolet radiation from the accretion disk rather than x - rays from the accreting pulsar .",
    "the cause of the rapid optical line variability reported by cr97 remains a puzzle .",
    "we attempted to use the observed line features to measure the radial velocity of v2116 oph .",
    "the pa@xmath4 line gave a velocity of @xmath32 km s@xmath2 , and the br@xmath18 line gave a velocity of @xmath33 km s@xmath2 .",
    "velocity measurements with the weak absorption features in the @xmath12-band spectrum were difficult , because the lines are inherently asymmetric ( kleinmann & hall 1986 ) and were measured at low resolution ; however , the and features gave velocities ranging from @xmath34 km s@xmath2 to @xmath35 km s@xmath2 . in principle , the strong co band features can provide an excellent velocity measurement",
    ". however , we did not attempt this since our wavelength calibration redward of about 2.3 @xmath0 m is uncertain , due to the lack of oh airglow lines in that region . for comparison , the h@xmath29 6563    emission line has a velocity of @xmath36 km s@xmath2 ( cr97 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the line profile for the 1.0830 @xmath0 m emission feature .",
    "weak emission ( equivalent width @xmath37 m ) in this line has been observed in several m giants , three of which are in binaries ( obrien & lambert 1986 ) .",
    "however , in v2116 oph this line is three orders of magnitude stronger ( @xmath3831  ) and is probably powered by photoionization of the red giant s wind by the accretion disk .",
    "a pronounced p cygni profile is evident in figure 2 .",
    "the blue edge of the absorption core has a velocity of @xmath39 km s@xmath2 , and the red edge of the emission line has a velocity of @xmath40 km s@xmath2 .",
    "p cygni profiles are caused by an expanding shell around a star ( e.g. , mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "the absorption core is due to material in front of the stellar disk , while the emission line is due to material on either side of the star .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity of the material is given by the velocity difference of the blue edge of the absorption core and the rest frame of the star .",
    "( the red edge of the emission line can not be used , since the star occults the material moving at maximum velocity . )",
    "we do not know the velocity of v2116 oph securely .",
    "however , adopting the average of the pa@xmath4 and br@xmath18 velocities , @xmath41 km s@xmath2 , we infer an outflow velocity of @xmath1 km s@xmath2 from v2116 oph .",
    "if we instead adopt the h@xmath29 velocity of @xmath42 km s@xmath2 for v2116 oph , then the inferred outflow velocity is @xmath43 km s@xmath2 .",
    "no clear evidence for a p cygni profile was found in the hydrogen paschen or brackett lines .",
    "late m giants generally have relatively strong 1.0827 @xmath0 m and 1.0828 @xmath0 m absorption lines ( obrien & lambert 1986 ) .",
    "we now consider whether these features could distort the intrinsic p cygni profile of the 1.083 @xmath0 m line .",
    "if we shift these features by our assumed radial velocity of @xmath44 km s@xmath2 for v2116 oph , then they would overlap the red edge of the p cygni absorption core but would leave the blue edge of the absorption core unaffected . also , the and features have a combined equivalent width of @xmath45   and a central depth of 25% relative to the continuum in late m giants ( obrien & lambert 1986 ) , compared to @xmath46   and a central depth of 80% for our p cygni absorption core .",
    "thus , we are confident that our outflow velocity is unaffected by the blended lines .",
    "it is widely believed that red giants have slow winds ( 1030 km s@xmath2 ; e.g. , reimers 1981 , dupree 1986 ) .",
    "since these winds are much slower than the photospheric escape velocity @xmath47 , the wind acceleration mechanism must be operating in the extended atmosphere of the giant .",
    "however , the outflow velocity we observe from v2116 oph is an order of magnitude larger than a typical red giant wind velocity .",
    "most existing measurements of wind velocities in late type giants were made in large stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , with @xmath48 .",
    "since we expect the wind velocity to scale roughly as @xmath49 , a smaller star might have a somewhat faster wind .",
    "indeed , a fast ( @xmath50 km s@xmath2 ) wind was observed from the metal - poor g9.5 iii fe-2 star hd 6833 , which has roughly solar mass and a radius of 3045 @xmath51 ( dupree , sasselov , & lester 1992 ) .",
    "based on luminosity and extinction arguments , cr97 concluded that v2116 oph is probably near the tip of the first - ascent red giant branch , with a radius @xmath52 .",
    "however , this argument seems unable to account for an order of magnitude increase in the wind velocity , since v2116 oph is certainly not a factor of 100 smaller in radius than an agb star .",
    "it is possible that the observed outflow is due to a wind from the accretion disk rather than the red giant .",
    "the x - ray timing behavior of the pulsar ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997 ) , the optical emission line spectrum ( cr97 ) , and the optical pulsations in the broadband blue continuum ( jablonski et al .",
    "1997 ) all point to the presence of an accretion disk in this binary .",
    "however , our observed velocity seems too _ small _ for mass loss from the disk , since accretion disk winds are radiatively driven and supersonic ( see , e.g. , warner 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "although isolated late - m giants may be unable to produce fast winds , it is possible that the energy for accelerating the outflow is provided by the hot component in a symbiotic binary . in the case of v2116 oph , either the ultraviolet radiation from the neutron star s accretion disk or x - rays from the neutron star itself certainly possess sufficient energy to power a fast wind .",
    "while direct radiative acceleration of the wind is inconsistent with our data , illumination of the red giant s atmosphere might lead indirectly to enhanced acceleration of an outflow .",
    "it is interesting to note that a strong 1.083 @xmath0 m p cygni profile indicative of a fast ( @xmath53 km s@xmath2 ) wind was also observed from the symbiotic star ci cyg , an m5 ii giant ( bensammar et al .",
    "the cool component in this eclipsing symbiotic binary is an agb star , while the hot component is thought to be a @xmath54 main sequence star with an accretion disk ( kenyon 1986 ; kenyon et al .",
    "the observed wind is probably from the cool component , however , as it is only observed during eclipse . as in v2116 oph ,",
    "the hydrogen brackett and paschen emission lines in ci cyg did show p cygni profiles .",
    "this is not particularly surprising , though , since the metastability of the lower state of the 1.083 @xmath0 m transition makes it a particularly sensitive probe of bulk mass motion in the atmospheres of cool stars ( obrien & lambert 1986 ; lambert 1987 ; dupree et al .",
    "1992 ) .    whatever the acceleration mechanism , a fast wind has important consequences in the gx 1 + 4/v2116 oph binary .",
    "cr97 pointed out that v2116 oph probably does not fill its roche lobe , since there is no evidence for the highly super - eddington mass transfer that would then be expected from such a large star .",
    "instead , they prefer the suggestion of makishima et al .",
    "( 1988 ) that the neutron star is accreting from the red giant wind . interpreting the marginal detection of 6 cm radio continuum emission from v2116 oph ( marti et al . 1997 ) as thermal bremsstrahlung due to ionization of the red giant wind by the accretion disk and/or the x - ray pulsar , cr97 inferred a wind mass - loss rate of @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the wind velocity and @xmath57 is the distance to the source . for a 10 km s@xmath2 wind",
    ", at least 1% of the wind would have to be accreted by the pulsar in order to explain the @xmath58 erg s@xmath2 x - ray luminosity observed from gx 1 + 4 .",
    "however , the required capture fraction drops to @xmath59% if the wind velocity is an order of magnitude higher .",
    "low capture efficiencies are typical of wind accretion in x - ray binaries ( see frank , king , & raine 1992 )",
    ".    we can use the p cygni profile to make an independent estimate of the wind mass loss from v2116 oph . naively assuming that the outflow consists of ionized hydrogen , and adopting the characteristic density and scale size of the symbiotic nebula enshrouding the giant ( cr97 ) , the continuity equation yields @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the electron density and @xmath62 is the effective radius of the outflow .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the rate inferred from the radio flux in equation ( 1 ) , assuming @xmath63 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "with such a high mass loss rate from the red giant , only a very small fraction of the wind need be accreted by the pulsar to explain the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "thus , it seems plausible that the accretion disk in gx 1 + 4 is supplied by the red giant s wind rather than by roche lobe overflow . if this is the case , then v2116 oph is the only known lmxb donor which does not fill its roche lobe .",
    "figure 1 : medium - resolution @xmath12-band spectrum of v2116 oph .",
    "except for the hydrogen br@xmath18 emission line , the spectrum is typical of an isolated m5 iii giant .",
