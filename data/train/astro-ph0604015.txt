    "the cosmic x  ray background ( cxrb ) is widely interpreted as the integrated x - ray emission from many discrete sources .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are expected to contribute the majority of the cxrb , and since the late 1980s the leading ` synthesis models ' have invoked a combination of absorbed and unabsorbed agn to reproduce the overall intensity and broadband spectral shape of the cxrb .",
    "typically these synthesis models are based on agn ` unification schemes ' @xcite in which each agn contains an obscuring torus , and the orientation to our line of sight determines the absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the energy density of the cxrb peaks at @xmath11 kev , but the cxrb has only been substantially resolved into sources at lower energies . in the 0.5 - 2 kev band , the deepest surveys with _ rosat _  resolved 70 - 80% of the x  ray background into individual objects , the majority of which are broad - line agn ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "deep surveys performed with _",
    "xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  have increased the resolved fraction to 80 - 90% in the 0.5 - 2  kev band , and have also resolved a significant fraction ( @xmath12 ) in the 2 - 10 kev band ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the broadband x - ray spectral properties of the objects detected in the _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  surveys support the hypothesis that the majority of the cxrb is due to agn with a wide range of photoelectric absorption .",
    "however , there have been a number of findings that are contrary to the assumptions and predictions of the synthesis models .",
    "firstly , the optical and x - ray spectroscopic characteristics of the x - ray sources are sometimes discrepant .",
    "there are now many examples of agn which appear to show photoelectric absorption from large column densities ( @xmath13  @xmath4 ) of material , but which exhibit little attenuation to their optical and ultraviolet radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",
    ", there are also examples of agn for which the broad optical emission lines are weak or absent , suggesting obscuration of the broad line region by dust , but which show little or no absorption in their x - ray spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "secondly the absorbed sources , and those without broad optical emission lines in their optical spectra ( often referred to as ` type 2 ' agn ) , are typically found at lower redshifts than predicted by the synthesis models @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the absorption properties of agn have some dependence on either luminosity or redshift , in contrast to the very simple geometric unification schemes employed in the earlier versions of the synthesis models , which were independent of luminosity or redshift .",
    "however , this issue is still controversial ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and determining the absorption characteristics of agn as a function of redshift and luminosity is one of the most important objectives of x - ray survey science .",
    "the 13@xmath0  _ xmm - newton _  / _ chandra _  deep field is a project to investigate the astrophysics of the major contributors to the cxrb , particularly sources around the break in the x  ray source counts where the contribution to the cxrb per log - flux interval peaks . in order to understand the phenomena , processes and conditions in these sources we combine the high quality x ",
    "ray spectra of _ xmm - newton_with the precise positions of _ chandra _  and a host of other multi - wavelength data , including a deep 1.4 ghz survey from the vla @xcite .",
    "the 13@xmath0  field is centred at @xmath14 , was the location of one of the deepest _ rosat _ surveys @xcite and is a region of extremely low galactic absorption ( @xmath15  @xmath4 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the european photon imaging camera ( epic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectra of the 13@xmath0  sources that have been optically identified and which have sufficient x - ray counts to yield a meaningful x - ray spectrum . at present , this amounts to 86 sources . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath16  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we define a power law spectrum as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of photons , @xmath21 is photon energy , @xmath22 is the photon index and @xmath23 is the normalisation .",
    "the source numbering scheme used here is identical to that used in @xcite .",
    "the 13@xmath0  field was observed three times with _ xmm - newton _  for a total exposure time of 200ks . when deadtime and periods of high background are excluded , the total live exposure time is 120ks for the pn  camera and 130ks for each of the mos  cameras .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  observations are fully described in @xcite .",
    "the epic spectra were produced from the same event lists , filtered with the same good time intervals , and using the same version of the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis system ( sas 6.0 ) as the source lists presented in @xcite .",
    "spectra were produced for all optically - identified sources with @xmath1 source counts .",
    "source counts were accumulated in elliptical regions centred on the positions reported by @xcite . the size and ellipticity of each source extraction region",
    "was determined by the off - axis angle of the x - ray source , and its countrate .",
    "the point spread function is relatively symmetrical near the centre of the _ xmm - newton _  field of view but becomes elongated in the tangential direction at larger off - axis angles .",
    "therefore to optimise signal to noise the ellipticity of the source extraction regions increases with off - axis angle , from 0 at the optical axis to 2 near the edge of the field .",
    "the minor axes of our source regions vary from 10@xmath24 to 20@xmath24 depending on the overall source countrates .",
    "there are several pairs of sources which are close enough together that the nominal extraction regions would overlap . in such cases",
    "the two regions were renormalised so that they do not overlap , with the ratio of the minor axes set to the ratio of the countrates of the two sources .",
    "all valid event patterns ( pattern 012 ) were used in constructing the mosspectra .",
    "for the pn spectra , single and double events ( pattern 04 ) were used for channel energies @xmath25  kev , and only single events were used for lower energy channels .",
    "channels close to the energies of the strongest instrumental emission lines ( cu - k at 7.8 kev in pn and al - k at 1.7 kev in mos ) were excluded from the spectra .",
    "response matrices and effective area files were constructed for each source region using the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen respectively . for each source",
    "the different epic spectra were combined to form a single spectrum over the 0.212 kev range , using the method of @xcite .",
    "spectra were grouped to a minimum of 30 counts per bin .",

    "the other 14 nelgs and galaxies which are not x - ray absorbed have x - ray properties implying the presence of an agn . at least at @xmath32 , where our r - band imaging probes the rest - frame optical starlight , these objects are luminous galaxies ( @xmath33 ) , containing relatively low x - ray luminosity agn ( @xmath34  erg  s@xmath5 ) , and the lack of agn signatures in the optical could be due to the dilution of the agn radiation by the bright host galaxy .",
