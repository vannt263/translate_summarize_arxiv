    "quantum technologies and engineering exploit entanglement to boost the efficiency of quantum devices . in spite of the many small - scale demonstrations of engineered quantum dynamics , the efficient control over large ensembles of quantum systems , for realistic realizations of scalable quantum technology applications , still seems to require significant effort from both the experimental and the theoretical side  @xcite . among the many strategies envisaged and pursued for quantum manipulations",
    ", reservoir engineering is particularly intriguing because it makes use of irreversible / dissipative processes to achieve the designed result at the steady state of controlled open quantum dynamics  @xcite .",
    "these techniques have been also applied to the manipulation of arrays , proving to be in principle applicable to a scalable architecture for quantum computation and information  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the schemes proposed so far , many control fields are typically needed to engineer the dynamics of the many elements , and the complexity of the problem increases fast with their number , making these strategies of difficult implementation with present day technologies .",
    "on the other hand it has been shown that in certain cases it suffices to have access only to a limited part of an ensemble of interacting elements to control the whole dynamics  @xcite . in this context , here we propose a new scheme for the preparation of entangled states in a chain of harmonic oscillators with nearest - neighbour coupling , by reservoir engineering , with active control over only a single element of the chain . specifically we show that a harmonic chain can approach an entangled steady state when only the central element of the chain is driven by a single - mode squeezed reservoir .",
    "in particular the oscillators of the chain get entangled in pairs .",
    "each pair is formed by the two oscillators at equal distance , on the left and on the right , from the central one , as sketched in fig .",
    "ideally , all the pairs are entangled with the same degree of entanglement ( which is directly related to the degree of squeezing of the bath ) irrespective of the size of the chain .",
    "this is the result of the interplay between localized irreversible dynamics and coherent interactions under specific symmetry conditions .",
    "similar results , concerning pairs of entangled systems belonging to two separated chains have been already discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which extended and generalized previous works on the transfer of entanglement to distant quantum objects  @xcite . however , we remark that , differently from the scheme discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the squeezed bath consists of two entangled modes each of which drives two independent arrays , here we consider a single squeezed mode which interacts with a single element of the chain .",
    "hence the idea of entanglement transfer is absent and , here , no spatially separated entangled fields are required .",
    "we study the performance of this protocol in the case of optomechanical and circuit - qed systems where the harmonic chain is realized by , respectively , mechanical and coplanar - waveguide resonators .",
    "in these implementations no squeezed resources are actually needed .",
    "in fact , in both cases an effective squeezed reservoir is realized by coupling the central resonator to an additional system driven by a two - tone field , which in appropriate parameter regimes can simulate a squeezed reservoir in the spirit of reservoir engineering  @xcite . in the first case",
