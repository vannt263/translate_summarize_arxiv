    "among different double - logarithmic ( dl ) contributions , there are the contributions that depend on the infrared cut - off",

    "this is known as the sudakov suppression  @xcite .",
    "it means the suppression of cross - sections of non - radiative processes compared to cross sections of the processes where bremsstrahlung is allowed .",
    "such a suppression in qed ( see e.g review @xcite ) and in qcd@xcite was studied in details to all orders in the couplings .",

    "@xcite that one - loop dl contribution to the @xmath2 has the opposite sign compared to the one for @xmath3 and @xmath0 -decays .",
    "it suggests that the total resummation of the dl corrections to the amplitude of the @xmath2 may be an exponential with a positive exponent .    in the present paper we consider amplitudes for the @xmath4 -decay .",
    "we show that the result of accounting for dl contributions to all orders in the ew couplings has an exponential form with the positive exponent . in other words",
    ", there is the enhancement instead of the suppression for such amplitudes .",
    "we consider the decays of the electroweak bosons into the left fermions @xmath5 and the right antifermions @xmath6 though drop the subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 through the paper .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we briefly review the sudakov suppression for amplitude of @xmath9 , comparing the use the feynman and the coulomb gauges . in sect .",
    "iii we discuss the decay of @xmath4 -bosons into fermions , again with using both the feynman and the coulomb gauges , and arrive at the enhancement .",

    "therefore , propagator @xmath56 of the isocalar field @xmath52 and propagator @xmath57 of the isovector field @xmath58 can be expressed in terms of the photon propagator @xmath59 and the @xmath17 -boson propagator @xmath60 . as dl contributions at the energies",
