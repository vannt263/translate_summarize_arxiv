    "preheating after inflation is a crucial stage in the early universe . fluctuations of matter fields and gravitational fields are amplified due to the parametric resonance caused by the coherent oscillation of the inflaton field@xcite .",
    "one of the important question on preheating is how the long wavelength metric fluctuation is amplified by the parametric resonance .",

    "they found that initial small fluctuations are amplified and evolve to random spatial distribution . in the separate universe , dynamical variables at each spatial point evolve independently .",
    "hence , in the early stage of evolution , fluctuations keep their initial spatial distribution and only the amplitude of fluctuations grows by the parametric resonance .",
    "when the amplitude of the massless field grows to be comparable to that of the inflaton field , the non - linear interaction between scalar fields becomes to be dominant and the system enters a chaotic regime .",
    "then , the field variables at each spatial point behave as independent random variables . at this stage ,",
