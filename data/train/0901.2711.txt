    "the potts model is the most natural generalisation of the two dimensional ising model and it is deeply connected with many areas of both statistical physics and mathematics ( for nice detailed reviews see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; for the relation with the problem of colour confinement see @xcite and the review @xcite ) .",
    "it has been very difficult at the moment to compute directly the analytic free energy of the ferromagnetic potts model in two dimensions on square lattice ( which is the main object of the present paper ) as it was done by onsager in the ising case @xcite .",
    "thus , it will be proposed here a less direct approach which is , nevertheless , able to give non - trivial analytic information on the free energy .",
    "the main purpose of this approach is not to give an exact solution for the free energy , but rather to present a simple functional form that obeys the known properties possessed by the free energy of the q - state potts model .",
    "in particular this method may give a reasonable approximation of the free energy function in all the range of temperatures even the not yet explored ones , i.e. outside the results of high and low temperature or the neighbourhood of critical point .",
    "following the point of view of the phenomenological regge theory of scattering ( see @xcite and @xcite ; two detailed reviews are @xcite and @xcite ) , a reasonable analytic form for the free energy in terms of one free parameter will be derived . in the present case it plays the role of regge s trajectories in high energy physics since it parametrises some analytical features of the potts model such as its duality properties and the fisher zeros , in an analogue way as the regge trajectories encode the non - perturbative duality properties of scattering amplitudes , as was first observed in @xcite .",
    "this can be done by requiring that the sought analytic expression for the free energy of the 2d potts model should be compatible ( in a suitable sense explained in the next sections ) with the proposal made in @xcite , acmp08 , @xcite for the free energy of the three dimensional ising model .",
    "the proposal of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is in a very good agreement with numerical data so that one should expect that this approach should provide one with a formula for the free energy of 2d potts which fit equally well the available numerical data .",
    "it will be shown that this is indeed the case .",
    "a non - trivial by - product of the present approach is that the proposed free energy of the 2d potts model has the locus of the fisher zeros which coincides with the well known and well tested conjecture in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the second section , it will be discussed a suitable consistency condition ( called here `` dimensional compatibility '' ) which allows to derive an analytic ansatz for the free energy of the 2d potts model in terms of few @xmath4dependent curves . in the third section , it will be analysed how the known duality symmetry of the potts model and its known critical behaviour fix all but one curve . in the fourth section , the proposed ansatz will be compared with the available numerical data both at high and low temperatures as well as at the critical point in the case @xmath1 . in the fifth section , the @xmath5 cases will be discussed . in the sixth section",
    "it will be shown how the proposed ansatz automatically predicts the locus of fisher zeros consistent with the well known conjecture .",
    "it is well known that the main thermodynamical quantities are combinatorial in nature .",
    "this fact makes the analysis of three - dimensional lattices even more difficult than the two dimensional cases . in this respect , it is a rather surprising result that one can even imagine to write down a simple explicit functional form for the free energy of the ising model in three dimensions which obeys known physical properties ( in particular , good agreement with the available numerical data ) . such simple expression is based on the assumption that the change in the combinatorial complexity when going from one to two dimensions is formally quite similar to the analogous change in the combinatorial complexity when going from two to three dimensions .",
    "one can write the exact onsager solution for the free energy in two dimensions as a convolution integral of the known exact free energy in one dimension with a suitable kernel . this integral kernel , which can be found explicitly , is the mathematical object responsible for the change in the combinatorial complexity when going from one to two dimensions @xcite .",
    "then , one argues that the change of many combinatorial quantities on hypercubic lattices ( such as , for instance , the scaling of the number of states of a given energy with the size of the lattice ) when going from one to two dimensions are similar to the analogous change when going from two to three dimensions ( this is somehow confirmed by a comparison with the available numerical data @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is not unnatural to assume that a suitable integral kernel exists such that when one consider its convolution with the onsager solution one gets the ( still unknown ) exact free energy of the ising model in three dimensions .",
    "our assumption based on the above considerations is that such kernel is as similar as possible to the already known one allowing to jump from one to two dimensions .",

    "afterwards , one can use such a modified operator to dress the onsager solution obtaining a useful ansatz for the free energy of the three dimensional ising model . to be more precise ,",
    "it is possible to define a class of operators @xmath18 such that when they act on the free energy @xmath19 of the @xmath4state ferromagnetic potts model on hypercubic lattices in @xmath20 dimensions give rise to the free energy @xmath21 of the @xmath4state potts model in @xmath22 dimensions@xmath23 = f_{\\left ( d+1\\right ) , q}\\left ( \\beta \\right ) .",
    "\\label{fode1}\\]]to fix the arbitrariness of the above definition it necessary to specify the domain of @xmath18 and how it acts .",

    "the variable is the inverse temperature and the singular point ( or points ) represents the phase transition .",
    "the range of the operator coincides with the domain since , by definition , when this operator acts on the free energy of the ising model on a hypercubic lattice it generates the free energy of an analogous system in one more dimension .",
    "a reasonable way to represent these operators is as integral kernel @xcite : the simplest of these integral kernel can be constructed explicitly by comparing the onsager solution with the free energy of the one - dimensional ising model .",
    "then , one can use an integral kernel of the same functional form to act on the onsager solution obtaining an approximate ansatz for the functional form of the free energy of the ising model in three dimensions ( the comparison of the ansatz with the numerical data is quite promising @xcite @xcite ) .      let @xmath25 be the operators which when applied to the free energy @xmath19 of the @xmath4state ferromagnetic potts model in @xmath20 dimensions give rise to the free energy @xmath26 of the @xmath27state potts model in @xmath20 dimensions@xmath28 = f_{d,\\left ( q+1\\right ) } \\left ( \\beta \\right ) .",

    "also in this case the range of the operator coincides with the domain .",
    "therefore , being the ranges and the domains of the operators @xmath18 and @xmath25 compatible , it makes sense to compose them .",

    "we would like to further emphasise that the main purpose of our work is to obtain an unique approximate functional form for free energy in the widest possible range of temperatures .",

    "( [ klpotts1 ] ) a low temperature taylor expansion , which involves many numerical derivations and integrations , using the standard commercial software ( available to us ) is very inaccurate and anyway beyond the goal of this work .",

    "in particular , the expansion of the partition function in the above references corresponds to only consider the interesting non - analytic term ( neglecting the trivial term @xmath98 in the ising case ) .",

    "@xmath141 one can also see that the agreement with numerical data at low and high temperatures is also very good but we have not been able to test the corresponding critical points because of some subtle numerical problems .",

    "the @xmath146 case remains basically opens but we have some indications that the present framework is also able to capture important features of such subtle case since it predicts automatically logarithmic correction to the power law divergence of the specific heat .",
