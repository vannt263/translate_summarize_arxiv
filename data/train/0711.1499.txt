    "most of the theoretical work developed in the context of quantum open systems relies in the use of the _ markov approximation _ , which assumes that when a quantum open system ( i.e. the atom ) interacts with its environment ( for instance a radiation field ) ,",
    "the later is not affected in a time scale comparable to that of the system .",
    "in other words , the radiation field absorbs the emitted photon instantaneously in comparison to the atomic evolution time scale .    however , the markovian assumption is only valid for radiation fields in which the photonic density of states ( dos ) is a continuous and smoothly varying function in the frequency space .",
    "when this function varies in a range which is comparable to the atomic spontaneous emission rate @xmath0 , then the environmental relaxation time ( also correlation time ) @xmath1 , can no longer be considered negligible in comparison with the atomic relaxation time .",
    "we are then dealing with _ non - markovian _ interactions , in which the environment does not absorb instantaneously every photon it receives from the atom , but needs a certain memory time @xmath1 to do it and return to its equilibrium state .",
    "non - markovian interactions may occur when the radiation field is placed in some structured environment , so that its photonic dos may present sudden jumps or singular behavior in a frequency range comparable to the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "for instance , in the so - called _ photonic crystals ( pc ) _",
    "@xcite , there is a periodicity in the refraction index which produces the scattering of light outside of the crystal for certain frequencies that are related to the lattice periodicity .",
    "since these modes are absent from the crystal , the photonic dos is zero in the corresponding frequencies , so that a _ gap _ is formed .",
    "the frequency ranges in which the photonic dos is non - zero are known as _",
    "bands_. within the bands , the photonic dos varies in frequency range comparable to the atomic spontaneous emission rate , which gives rise to long memory time for the environment .",
    "this kind of non - markovian interaction may also be found in a quantum cavity , when the range of variation of the photonic dos is comparable to the spontaneous emission rate @xcite .    in non - markovian interactions",
    "the emitted photon may be eventually reabsorbed by the atom , which produces a back - action in the system dynamics , both in the evolution of its expectation values and the multiple - time correlation functions ( mtcf ) of its observables",
    ". an important consequence of this is that some related physical quantities such as the _ atomic emission spectra _ also display non - markovian features .",
    "hence , it is necessary to obtain a more general formula for the atomic emission spectra without using the markovian approximation .    in most of the literature ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) , the analytical expression for the spectra",
    "is derived by assuming the markov approximation at some stage . to be more specific , in photodetector experiments",
    "the emission spectra depends on a two - time correlation of the positive and negative operators of the radiation field emitted by the atom . in order to evaluate it ,",
    "this two - time correlation is expressed in terms of a two - time correlation of system observables , which is done by assuming the markovian approximation . in the end , it is find that within this approximation the spectra is related to a fourier transform of the system two - time correlation @xcite .",
    "moreover , once the two - time correlation is computed through the quantum regression theorem , a lorentzian profile for the spectra is obtained .",
    "this theorem states that the evolution of @xmath2-time correlation functions can be computed with the master equation by only considering a rotation in its initial condition .    in this paper",
    ", we derive a formula to compute the atomic emission spectra for non - markovian interactions .",
    "we show that the two - time correlation of the positive and negative operators of the radiation field is related to a two - time correlation of system observables through a double convolution integral , that also depends on the environmental correlation function .",
    "the decaying of this environmental correlation function gives the correlation time or relaxation time of the environment @xmath1 , which for non - markovian interactions is non - zero .",
    "moreover , the two - time correlation of the system observables can no longer be described within the so - called quantum regression theorem ( qrt ) , since the derivation of such formula relies in the markov approximation @xcite . in the non - markovian case",
    ", the set of evolution equations derived in @xcite should be used to evaluate mtcf . moreover ,",
    "the formula we derive for the emission spectra is dependent on the spatial distance between the emitting atom and the detector .    in order to illustrate the theory",
    ", we study the fluorescence spectra of a two - level atom in contact with the modified radiation field that exists within a photonic crystal . in the stationary limit",
    ", the emission in the frequency region corresponding to the gap is made in the form of evanescent modes , which present an exponentially decaying spatial dependency .",
    "it is clear that when evanescent modes are present in the emission , the fluorescence spectra depends dramatically on the distance from the atom to the detector .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ secii ] we present the general hamiltonian for the class of systems that we want to describe , as well as the environmental correlation function that characterizes the interaction . in section [ seciii ]",
    "we present a formula to obtain a non - markovian spectra in terms of a two - time correlation of system observables , convoluted with the environmental correlation function .",
    "this formula depends explicitly on the distance between the emitting system and the detector , and is one of the main results of this paper .",
    "section [ seciv ] is devoted to review the evolution equations of system two - time correlations within the weak coupling limit .",
    "in the last part of the paper ( section [ secv ] ) we apply the theory to compute the fluorescence spectra of a two - level atom placed as an impurity in a photonic crystal , showing that the distance between the atom and the detector is an important parameter to take into account if we want to characterize correctly the spectra in the gap region .",
    "let us consider the model hamiltonian to study the dynamics of @xmath3 with hamiltonian @xmath4 , in interaction with @xmath5 .",
    "assuming a linear coupling , we have @xmath6 where the operator @xmath7 acts on the hilbert space of the system and @xmath8 are the annihilation and creation operators on the environment hilbert space .",
    "the @xmath9 are the coupling constants that can be taken as real numbers , and the @xmath10 are the frequencies of the harmonic oscillators that constitute the environment .    along the paper",
    "we will assume the weak coupling approximation , which consists in considering that the system interaction hamiltonian is @xmath11 times smaller than the free hamiltonian , which includes both the hamiltonian of the system and the environment .",
    "we will also use for simplicity units in which @xmath12 .",
    "the linear model of interaction hamiltonian is good enough to characterize most of the interactions in quantum optics related to processes in which only one photon is involved , and which can be described within the dipolar approximation .",
    "the dynamics of the quantum mean values and mtcf can be computed in two distinct ways : _ first _ , by evolving vectors on the system hilbert space ( see for instance @xcite ) . in this evolution",
    "there are two important quantities that describe the action of the environment into the system : the environmental correlation function @xmath13 which as noted before decays within a time @xmath1 and describes the dissipation of the system , and a certain quantity @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 $ ] represents a gaussian average .",
    "the function @xmath17 can be interpreted as a gaussian colored noise , and describes the stochastic effect of the many environmental degrees on the system wave vector @xcite .",
    "_ second _ , in the heisenberg picture , by evolving system operators . in these equations ,",
    "the action of the environment is described entirely through the correlation function ( [ chapdos15 ] ) .",
    "note that in the markov case , @xmath18 ( corresponding to @xmath19 ) , and the quantity @xmath17 may represent a gaussian white noise . in this paper , we need to compute some two - time correlations of system observables . we will do it within the heisenberg picture scheme , by using the system of equations derived in @xcite in the weak coupling limit .",
    "to compute the environment correlation function , it is necessary to perform the sum appearing in ( [ chapdos15 ] ) , which can in principle be done once the value of @xmath20 is known for the particular interaction . for instance , in the our case of an atom dipolarly coupled with the radiation field , the coupling constants are known , and the quantum number is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the quantum number corresponding to the wave vector , and @xmath23 corresponds to the two polarization modes",
    ".    however , there are certain problems where the functional form @xmath20 is not known , for instance atoms in contact with the phonons in a solid . in those cases , it is often useful to express the sum appearing in ( [ chapdos15 ] ) as @xmath24 where we have defined the so - called spectral function as @xmath25 .",
    "this spectral function can be approximated with some phenomenological models ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral function can be expressed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the function @xmath20 in the continuum and @xmath28 is the photonic dos of the environment . inserting this relation in ( [ chapdos16 ] )",
    "it is easy to see the important role of the photonic dos in the correlation function , and particularly in its decaying time @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we note that despite the weak coupling approximation here used is only valid for weak and medium couplings , and therefore it might not capture completely the non - markovian behavior of the system , it does describe some important memory effects in its dynamics .",
    "particularly , the evolution of the system observables depend on their past history up to the time @xmath1 that the environment takes to relax back to equilibrium after the interaction .",
    "in this section we present the formula necessary to obtain the emission spectra of an atom with non - markovian interaction . to this end , we follow a well known photo - detection model of experiment , the _ gedanken spectrum analyzer _ that can be found in @xcite , and which provides an operational definition of the spectral profile . in this scheme , we consider that the radiation field emitted by a two - level atom is detected by another two - level atom with frequency @xmath29 , which is initially prepared in its ground state @xmath30 .",
    "the detecting atom has hamiltonian @xmath31 , and it is placed inside a shutter , that only opens during a certain observation time @xmath32 , during which it receives the emitted radiation , being eventually excited .",

    "the super - index @xmath43 reminds that these are the components of the detector s dipole , and @xmath44 is the dipolar operator .",
    "it is important to note here that the field operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 , correspond to the radiative atoms and the radiation field with @xmath36 .",

    "the dynamics near the edge of the band are often described through an effective mass approximation to the full dispersion relation , based on its expansion in the vicinity of the band edge ( see for instance @xcite ) . within this approximation , and considering the simplest case of a cubic lattice , the dispersion relation has the parabolic form @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the origin of the first brillouin zone of the crystal ( which is the unitary cell in @xmath22 space ) about which we perform the expansion in each direction , @xmath174 is the frequency of the band edge , and @xmath175 is a constant that depends on the specific photonic crystal considered . although it is valid for the description of several important physical phenomena occurring in pbg materials @xcite , this model of dispersion relation becomes inaccurate for a good description of the short time dynamics .",
    "the dispersion relation proposed in @xcite overcomes this problem by reproducing the periodic structure of the bands , @xmath176 notice that this function reduces to the parabolic model for @xmath177 . for a three dimensional band structure with the periodic dispersion relation ( [ waniso ] ) , the correlation function can be obtained from the equation ( [ generalcorr5 ] ) once it has been assumed that the function @xmath178 is a slowly varying function in the @xmath179 .",

    "we show the fluorescence spectra for a certain distance @xmath225 of the detector ( expressed by taking the periodicity of the crystal as the unity ) which is small enough as to be still detecting some evanescent modes from the gap .",
    "different choices of @xmath214 shows that the more deep in the gap the emission occurs , the less we are efficient to detect it , due to the decreasing of the localization length .",
    "figure ( [ locfield2 ] ) shows the spectra for a fixed value of @xmath214 , but varying the distance of the detector , in such a way that for @xmath225 large enough , a complete suppression of fluorescence from the gap ( corresponding to the left side - band ) occurs .     for different values of the rabi frequency @xmath214 , and a fixed distance of the detector @xmath226 .",
    "in all the cases the left sideband of the mollow triplet is emitted in gap frequencies .",
    "while the distance @xmath225 is small enough to detect the evanescent modes , the fact that the localization length is smaller for increasing distance to the band edge @xmath227 , makes the left mollow component be increasingly small for increasing values of @xmath214 .",
    "[ locfield1],scaledwidth=50.0% ]     for different values of the the detector distance @xmath225 , and fixed rabi frequency @xmath228 , so that the left sideband of the mollow triplet is emitted in gap frequencies .",
    "it is observed that for distances large enough this line is no longer detected , an a complete filtering of the spectra within the gap is obtained .",
    "[ locfield2],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    concerning this , two important remarks have to be made here .    * in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , where a filter @xmath229 is introduced for emission frequencies within the gap , in the description presented here no filtering effect occurs unless the spatial dependency is considered , and the detector is placed in the far field .",
    "* a second remark concerns the difference between the spontaneous and the fluorescence spectra . even considering the spatial dependency and the detector in the far field ,",
    "some radiation is detected within the gap region in the spontaneous emission spectra .",
    "the reason is that there is a transient field , called diffusive field , that appears at the beginning of the atomic evolution . since this field can be emitted in the gap frequencies , it carries away energy from the atom .",
    "hence , it is responsible of the slight dissipation that occurs in the atomic population of the excited level at the initial time steps of the evolution @xcite .",
    "a description of this field , including its spatial dependency is found in @xcite . in this paper , this is done by solving the atom dynamics within the one photon sector .",
    "+ in contrast , the fluorescence spectra deals with the signal emitted by the atom in the stationary limit , and therefore the transient field is no longer detected .",
    "for that reason , the radiation within the gap is only composed of evanescent modes , and can not be observed when placing the detector far away from the atom . + in summary , it is true that the filtering appears as a consequence of the special form of the dispersion relation of the field in the pc .",
    "however , we show here that this filtering only occurs provided that the signal is in the stationary limit , and the distance between the emitting source and the detector is large .",
    "we present in this paper a general formula to compute the emission spectra of an atom linearly coupled to an environment with non - markovian interaction , and within the weak coupling approximation .",
    "this formula is explicitly dependent on the distance between the emitting atom and the detector , @xmath230 .",
    "we apply it to compute the fluorescence spectra of a two - level atom in a photonic crystal . in those materials , the electromagnetic field",
    "have very specific features , showing a gap or range of frequencies where the propagating modes are not allowed . in that frequency region",
    ", the emission spectra depends critically on @xmath230 , since the emission occurs in the form of evanescent ( non propagating ) modes , which decay exponentially from the atom .",
    "for that reason , we show that in the far field these modes are not detected .",
    "we note that the description of this evanescent field can only be made with a non - markovian description , since a markov theory , with dissipation rates calculated through the fermy golden rule , predicts no emission at all within the gap region .",
