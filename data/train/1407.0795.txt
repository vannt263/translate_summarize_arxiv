    "we therefore believe that although our attempts in this direction failed , there is value in summarizing our efforts .      our first formulation yields a semi - algebraic set defined in @xmath523 by four equalities ( two of of degree @xmath524 , two of degree @xmath525 ) and twelve quadratic inequalities .",

    "we can assume that @xmath37 is at the origin , @xmath38 is on the @xmath208-axis and @xmath39 is on the @xmath444-plane .",
    "the four points can thus be described using six variables @xmath526 .",
    "we next argue that parameterizing the directions of the two lines , rather than the lines themselves , is sufficient .",
    "indeed , the geometric permutation realized by a line tangent or transversal to the four balls can be read from its direction vector @xmath527 alone : that line meets @xmath285 before @xmath170 if and only if @xmath528 .",
    "also , we can assume that the centers of the balls are not coplanar , since in this case conjecture  [ conj : abcd - acdb ] is known to hold , so equation  ( 6 ) of borcea et al .",
    "@xcite allows to retrieve the full description of the line from its direction and the coordinates of the centers of the balls .",
    "so let @xmath529 denote the direction vectors of two common tangents in order , respectively , @xmath2 and @xmath178 .",
    "since no line parallel to the @xmath530-plane can be a common tangent to the balls @xmath3 and @xmath21 , up to scaling we can write the two vectors @xmath531 and @xmath532 .",
    "the condition that @xmath533 is a direction of a common tangent to the four balls is equivalent to equations  ( 7 ) and  ( 8) of borcea et al .",
    "@xcite ; we thus have for each @xmath533 two equalities , one of degree  @xmath524 with @xmath534 terms , the other of degree  @xmath525 with @xmath535 terms .",
    "we then require that the balls be disjoint by adding six quadratic inequalities that require that the squared distance between any two centers is at least @xmath45 .",
    "we finally ensure that the two lines meet the balls in the right order by six bilinear inequalities that constrain the signs of @xmath536 , @xmath537 , @xmath538 and likewise for @xmath539 .",
    "our second formulation builds on conjecture  [ conj : double - pinning ] and yields a semi - algebraic set defined , essentially , in @xmath523 by six equalities of degree @xmath45 , six linear inequalities and six inequalities of degree  @xmath45 .",
    "we first describe an alternating hyperboloidal configuration @xmath437 using @xmath540 variables @xmath541 , six degree - four inequalities and three linear inequalities .",
    "specifically , we equip @xmath187 with an orthonormal frame such that @xmath404 is the @xmath208-axis and its minimal pinning by @xmath8 is witnessed by the hyperbolic paraboloid with equation @xmath542 ; the centers of the balls are thus on the quadric with equation @xmath543 .",
    "the position of ball @xmath544 is given by the variable @xmath545 that represents the @xmath208-coordinate of the tangency point of @xmath544 and @xmath404 .",
    "assuming the balls have unit radius , the position of the center is then : @xmath546 it remains to require that the balls be non - overlapping ( six inequalities of degree four bounding from below the squared distances between centers ) and to specify the order in which the balls touch the line @xmath404 ( three linear inequalities ordering the @xmath545 s ) .",
    "our semi - algebraic set then describes the existence of two configurations of the previous type that realize the geometric permutations @xmath2 and @xmath178 and where the tetrahedra of centers are isometric . indeed ,",
    "if two such configurations exist then a rigid motion that maps each ball from the first configuration to the matching ball in the second configuration will send the @xmath208-axis of the first configuration to a transversal realizing @xmath2 in the second configuration .",
    "conversely , if a counter - example to conjectures  [ conj : double - pinning ] exists then it gives rise to a pair of configuration as described above .",
    "we build our system by picking two independent sets of variables @xmath547 and @xmath548 , collecting the linear inequalities enforcing the orders @xmath2 on one configuration and @xmath178 on the other , collecting the six degree - four inqualities enforcing that the first configuration is non - overlapping ( we drop their counterparts in the second configuration as they are redundant if the configurations are isometric ) and adding the condition @xmath549 for each of the six pairs in @xmath550 .",
    "we expect the variety defined by these equations ( ie .",
    "dropping the inequations ) to have dimension  @xmath45 : the lower bound comes from the system ( @xmath525 variables minus @xmath524 equations , hoping for transverse intersection ) and the upper bound comes from the geometry ( dimension @xmath540 or more would imply that in the space of configurations of four balls with two tangents , the set of configurations where both tangents are pinned has codimension  @xmath551 whereas we expect that when deforming such a configuration , both pinnings need not happen simultaneously ) .",
    "the system contains a @xmath540-dimensional degenerate component that corresponds to @xmath552 , as the parameterization then degenerates .",
    "we therefore add one variable @xmath132 and the equality @xmath553 so that the existence of a solution in @xmath132 forces the other term to be non - zero . by adding a variable @xmath132 and an equality @xmath554",
    "is known as `` saturation '' . ]",
    "the first system seems a challenge for symbolic methods such as critical point techniques .",
    "such methods typically first operate on the underlying variety , obtained by dropping from the system all inequalities .",
    "this variety therefore corresponds to configurations of four , possibly intersecting , unit balls with two common tangents , in any order .",
    "that variety appears to be unmixed , that is , it contains components of different dimensions , and to contain a singular locus of dimension at least  @xmath331 ( those configurations where a tangent is pinned ) .",
