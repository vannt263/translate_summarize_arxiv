    "naturally a lot of attention has been paid to study spin transport in low - dimensional systems both from experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite points of view .",
    "the understanding of electronic localization in low - dimensional model quantum systems is always an interesting issue .",
    "whereas , it is a well established fact that in an infinite one - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) system with random site potentials all energy eigenstates are exponentially localized irrespective of the strength of randomness due to anderson localization  @xcite , there exists another kind of localization , known as wannier - stark localization , which results from a static bias applied to a regular @xmath0d lattice , even in absence of any disorder  @xcite . till date a large number of works have been done to explore the understanding of anderson localization and scaling hypothesis in one- and two - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "similarly , wannier - stark localization has also drawn the attention of many theorists  @xcite as well as experimentalists  @xcite .",
    "for both these two cases , viz , infinite @xmath0d materials with random site energies and @xmath0d systems subjected to an external electric field , one never encounters any _ mobility edge _ i.e. , energy eigenvalues separating localized states from the extended ones , since all the eigenstates are localized .",
    "but there exist some special types of @xmath0d materials , like quasi - periodic aubry - andre model and correlated disordered systems where mobility edge phenomenon at some particular energies is obtained  @xcite .",
    "although the studies involving mobility edge phenomenon in low - dimensional systems have already generated a wealth of literature  @xcite there is still need to look deeper into the problem to address several interesting issues those have not yet been explored .",
    "for example , whether the mobility edges can be observed in some other simple @xmath0d materials or the number of mobility edges separating the extended and localized regions in the full energy band of an @xmath0d material can be regulated , are still to be investigated .    to address these issues in the present article we investigate two - terminal spin dependent transport in a @xmath0d mesoscopic chain composed of magnetic and non - magnetic atomic sites in presence of external electric field . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no rigorous effort has been made so far to explore the effect of an external electric field on electron transport in such a @xmath0d magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice geometry .",
    "here we show that , depending on the unit cell configuration , a @xmath0d superlattice structure subjected to an external electric field exhibits multiple mobility edges at different values of the carrier energy .",
    "we use a simple tight - binding ( tb ) framework to illustrate the model quantum system and numerically evaluate two - terminal spin dependent transmission probabilities through the superlattice geometry based on the green s function formalism . from our exact numerical analysis",
    "we establish that a sharp crossover from a completely opaque to a fully or partly transmitting zone takes place which leads to a possibility of tuning the electron transport by gating the transmission zone .",
    "in addition to this behavior we also show that the magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice structure can be used as a pure spin filter for a wide range of energy .",
    "these phenomena enhance the prospect of such simple superlattice structures as switching devices at multiple energies as well as spin filter devices , the design of which has significant impact in the present age of nanotechnology .    with an introduction in section i",
    ", we organize the paper as follows . in section ii , first we present the model , then describe the theoretical formulation which include the hamiltonian and the formulation for transmission probabilities through the model quantum system .",
    "the numerical results are illustrated in section iii and finally , in section iv , we draw our conclusions .",

    "below , we address the central results of our study i.e , the possibility of getting multiple mobility edges in @xmath0d magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice geometries and how such a simple model quantum system can be used as a perfect spin filter for a wide range of energy .    in fig .",
    "[ localization1 ] we show the variation of total transmission probability @xmath78 along with the average density of states for a @xmath0d magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice geometry considering a linear bias drop .",
    "here we consider a @xmath79-site chain in which each unit cell contains one magnetic and four non - magnetic sites and the results are shown for three different bias voltages .",
    "for the particular case when the chain is free from external electric field i.e. , @xmath80 electronic conduction through the bridge takes place for the entire energy band as shown in fig .",
    "[ localization1](a ) which predicts that all the energy eigenstates are extended in nature .",
    "the situation becomes really very interesting when the superlattice geometry is subjected to an external electric field .",
    "it is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ localization1](b ) and [ localization1](c ) . from these spectra",
    "we notice that there are some energy regions for which the transmission probability completely drops to zero which reveals that the eigenstates associated with these energies are localized , and they are separated from the extended energy eigenstates .",
    "thus , sharp mobility edges are obtained in the spectrum , and , the total number of such mobility edges separating the extended and localized regions in a superlattice geometry in presence electric field strongly depends on the unit cell configuration and it can be regulated by adjusting the number of magnetic and non - magnetic sites .",
    "this phenomenon describes the existence of multiple mobility edges in a superlattice geometry under finite bias condition .",
    "now if the fermi energy is fixed at a suitable energy zone where @xmath78 drops to zero an insulating phase will appear , while for the other case , where @xmath78 is finite , a metallic phase is observed and it leads to the possibility of controlling the electronic transmission by gating the transmission zone .",
    "the width of the localized regions between the band of extended regions increases with the strength of the electric    field as clearly shown by comparing the spectra given in figs .",
    "[ localization1](b ) and [ localization1](c ) , and , for strong enough field strength almost all energy eigenstates are localized . in that particular limit metal - to - insulator transition will no longer be observed .",
    "the above results are analyzed for a particular ( linear ) variation of electric field along the chain . to explore the sensitivity of getting metal - to - insulator transition on the distribution of electric field , in figs .",
    "[ localization2 ] and [ localization3 ] we present the results for two different screened electric field profiles taking the identical chain length . from the spectra we clearly observe that the width of the localized region gradually disappears with the flatness of the electric field profile in the interior of the bridge system .",
    "if the potential drop takes place only at the chain - to - electrode interfaces , i.e. , when the potential profile becomes almost flat along the chain the width of the localized region almost vanishes and the metal - to - insulator transition is not observed , as is the case for the zero bias limit .    finally , we illustrate how such a simple magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice geometry can be utilized as a perfect spin filter for    a wide range of energy in absence of any external electric field . as illustrative example , in fig .",
    "[ filter1 ] we present the transmission probabilities for up and down spin electrons together with the average density of states as a function of energy for a @xmath0d magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice geometry . from the spectra we observe that the up and down spin electrons follow two different channels while traversing through the superlattice geometry , since the spin flipping",
    "is completely blocked for this configuration .",
    "this splitting of up and down spin conduction channels is responsible for spin filtering action and the total number of these channels strongly depends on the unit cell configuration . from figs .",
    "[ filter1](a ) and ( b ) we clearly see that for a wide range of energy for which the transmission probability of up spin electrons drops to zero value , shows non - zero transmission probability of down spin electrons .",
    "therefore , setting the fermi energy to a suitable energy region we can control the transmission characteristics of up and down spin electrons , and , a spin selective transmission is thus obtained through the bridge system .",
    "before we end , we would like to point out that since the overlap between the up and down spin conduction channels depends on the magnitudes of the local magnetic moments , we can regulate the spin degree of polarization ( dop ) simply by tuning the strength of these magnetic moments and for a wide range of energies it ( dop ) almost reaches to @xmath81 .",
    "thus , our proposed magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice geometry is a very good example for designing a spin filter .",
    "to conclude , in the present work we investigate in detail the spin dependent transport under finite bias condition through a @xmath0d magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice geometry using green s function formalism .",
    "we use a simple tb framework to describe the model quantum system where all the calculations are done numerically . from our exact numerical analysis",
    "we predict that in such a simple @xmath0d magnetic - non - magnetic superlattice geometry multiple mobility edges separating the localized and extended regions are obtained in presence of external electric field and the total number of mobility edges in the full energy spectrum can be controlled by arranging the unit cell configuration .",
    "this phenomenon reveals that the superlattice geometry can be used as a switching device for multiple values of fermi energy .",
    "the sensitivity of metal - to - insulator transition and vice versa on the electrostatic potential profile is thoroughly discussed .",
    "finally , we analyze how such a superlattice geometry can be utilized in designing a tailor made spin filter device for wide range of energies . setting the fermi energy at a suitable energy zone",
    ", a spin selective transmission is obtained through the bridge system .",
    "all these predicted results may be utilized in fabricating spin based nano electronic devices .",
    "the results presented in this communication are worked out for absolute zero temperature .",
    "however , they should remain valid even in a certain range of finite temperatures ( @xmath82k ) .",
    "this is because the broadening of the energy levels of the chain due to the chain - to - electrode coupling is , in general , much larger than that of the thermal broadening  @xcite .",
