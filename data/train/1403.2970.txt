    "heuristically , given an artin algebra @xmath22 , we may view an element of @xmath23 as a family of complex submanifolds of @xmath5 deforming @xmath7 , which is parameterized by @xmath24 ( with basepoint the unique geometric point of @xmath24 , i.e. the maximal ideal ) .",
    "in the situation that there is a well - defined moduli space @xmath8 as above , we may identify @xmath23 with the set of ( pointed ) maps @xmath25 ; for example , the value of @xmath26 on the so - called  dual numbers \" @xmath27/(\\epsilon^2)$ ] gives the ( geometric ) tangent space of @xmath8 at @xmath28 .",
    "appealing to the functor of points philosophy , we may view @xmath26 itself as a formal stand - in for the moduli space that can always be defined .",
    "even when @xmath8 itself does not exist , the  tangent space \" @xmath29/(\\epsilon^2))$ ] still has an interesting geometric interpretation .",

    "given an artin algebra @xmath22 , a deformation @xmath33 , and a surjective map @xmath34 in @xmath20 , consider the problem of finding an extension of @xmath35 to @xmath36 , i.e. an element @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 .",
    "in general , there will be an obstruction to the existence of such an extension .",
    "if a smooth moduli space @xmath8 exists , however , then it is always possible to solve this extension problem and we say @xmath26 is _",
    "unobstructed_. from a different perspective , we might allow @xmath8 to be a more general ( possible singular ) type of space than a complex manifold ; the obstruction problem for @xmath26 then relates to the smoothness of @xmath8 at @xmath28 .",
    "this explains the importance of the following well - known result @xcite@xcite .",
    "[ z obstructions ] let @xmath6 be a complex submanifold satisfying the condition @xmath39 then the deformation functor @xmath40 is unobstructed .",
    "compared to theorem [ z tangent ] , which has a very clear geometric interpretation , theorem [ z obstructions ] is perhaps harder to understand intuitively ( and is correspondingly more difficult to prove ) .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend the above constructions and results as far as possible into the realm of _ generalized _ complex geometry @xcite@xcite .",
    "a generalized complex structure on a manifold @xmath5 is an endomorphism of the vector bundle @xmath41 ( the direct sum of the tangent bundle and cotangent bundle ) , which squares to minus the identity , preserves the natural pairing of @xmath41 with itself , and satisfies an integrability condition defined with respect to the _ dorfman bracket _",

    ", a fundamental appeal of gc geometry is that it provides a framework for treating complex and symplectic geometry in a unified way .",
    "the subject also admits a wide variety of interesting examples : these range from examples that may be viewed as hybrids ( or deformations ) of complex and symplectic manifolds , to more exotic structures that exhibit features not present in either of the two  classical \" cases @xcite .    to motivate the generalization of complex submanifolds whose deformation theory we study in this paper , as well as to explain some of the issues that arise in generalizing from the case of complex submanifolds , consider the following situation .",
    "let @xmath44 be a symplectic manifold , and consider the problem of constructing a well - behaved moduli space of _ lagrangian _ submanifolds of @xmath5 .",
    "an issue that immediately arises  not present in the complex case  is the need to incorporate the so - called _ hamiltonian symmetries _ of @xmath44 .",
    "recall that , to any smooth function @xmath45 we may associate its _ hamiltonian vector field _ , which is characterized ( up to a sign convention ) by the equation @xcite @xmath46",
    "every such vector field is an infinitesimal symmetry of the symplectic structure ; in particular the flow @xmath47 generated by @xmath48 ( when it exists ) satisfies @xmath49 for each @xmath50 .",

    "and they form a subgroup of the group of all symplectomorphisms of @xmath44 .",
    "when forming a moduli space of lagrangian submanifolds , it is custumary to identity two lagrangians @xmath51 if @xmath52 for some hamiltonian symmetry @xmath53 . this is necessary , for example , to have any hope of constructing a finite dimensional moduli space @xcite .    from the point of view of mirror symmetry ( and string theory ) , it is actually more natural to consider a slightly different moduli space ; namely , the collection of all pairs @xmath54 , where @xmath6 is a lagrangian submanifold , and @xmath55 is a hermitian line bundle with a flat connection supported on @xmath7 @xcite@xcite . adopting terminology from physics @xcite , such an object",
    "may be called a ( rank 1 ) _",
    "lagrangian brane_. a nice property of this moduli space ( when it can be defined ) , is that it carries a natural complex structure .",
    "an added subtlety is the need to keep track of the possible equivalences between line bundles with connection .    on any gc manifold @xmath56 , a ( rank 1 ) _",
    "gc brane _ is similarly defined as a submanifold @xmath6 , together with a hermitian line bundle with unitary connection @xmath55 supported on @xmath7 ; the pair @xmath57 must satisfy a certain condition defined with respect to @xmath58 . in the case of a complex manifold @xmath5 , the compatibility condition implies that @xmath7 must be a complex submanifold , and the curvature form @xmath59 of @xmath55 must be of type @xmath60 with respect to the induced complex structure on @xmath7 ( i.e. the connection must induce a holomorphic structure on @xmath55 ) @xcite@xcite .",
    "in particular , any complex submanifold  equipped with the trivial line bundle  gives an example of a gc brane . in the symplectic case ,",
    "the lagrangian branes described above give one type of example , but there are actually others as well .",
    "these so - called  coisotropic \" a - branes were first introduced by kapustin and orlov in @xcite , motivated by considerations coming from string theory and homological mirror symmetry ; the fact that these more exotic objects arise naturally in the context of gc geometry is another appealing feature of this framework @xcite .    in this paper we will study the formal deformation theory of gc branes . in analogy to the symplectic case described above , it will be important to incorporate the action of the _ generalized hamiltonian _ symmetries of @xmath56 on gc branes . on a gc manifold @xmath56 ,",
    "one may associate to any _ complex_-valued function @xmath61 its _ generalized hamiltonian vector field _ , which is a section @xmath62 .",
    "as in the symplectic case , @xmath63 is an infinitesimal symmetry of @xmath56 , and may ( at least locally ) be integrated to a family of symmetries ( a  flow \" ) .",
    "such a symmetry consists of a pair @xmath64 , where @xmath65 ^ -{\\cong } & } } x$ ] is a diffeomorphism and @xmath66 is a 1-form . roughly speaking",
    ", the diffeomorphism component acts on a brane by pulling it back , and the 1-form component acts by changing the connection on the line bundle .",
    "let describe the main constructions and results of the paper .",
    "for each gc brane @xmath0 , we construct a functor in this paper , but an extension to @xmath20 is also possible . ]",
    "@xmath67 encoding the formal deformations of @xmath0 ( definition [ brane deformation functor ] ) .",
    "this functor is defined as the truncation of a certain formal groupoid @xmath68 ( definition [ full deformation groupoid ] ) , which encodes all the relevant notions of equivalence for deformations ( including those induced by generalized hamiltonian symmetries ) .",
    "the construction of this functor is more intricate than in the case of complex submanifolds discussed above , and is done in several steps .    as a first step in studying the deformations of a gc brane @xmath0",
    ", we consider the value of the functor @xmath69 on the dual numbers @xmath70 ; these are the first - order deformations of @xmath0",
    ". it was argued in @xcite that such first - order deformations should correspond to elements of a certain lie algebroid cohomology group associated to @xmath0 ; we recover their result in a rigorous framework .",
    "[ brane tangent ] for every gc brane @xmath0 , there is a natural bijection between elements of @xmath71/(\\epsilon^2))$ ] and elements of the lie algebroid cohomology group @xmath72 .",
    "the calculation needed to prove this result is somewhat involved  and different from the one in @xcite ",
    "so the fact that we reach the same conclusion may be regarded as a check on our definition [ brane deformation functor ] .",
    "to explain the connection to theorem [ z tangent ] stated above , suppose @xmath6 is a complex submanifold , regarded as a gc brane @xmath73 .",
    "there is a natural isomorphism @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the sheaf of holomorphic one - forms on @xmath7 .",
    "the first component @xmath76 corresponds to the possible deformations of the submanifold @xmath7 , as discussed above .",
    "the second component @xmath77 corresponds to deformations of the trivial holomorphic line bundle on @xmath7 . from a different perspective , if we denote by @xmath78 the coherent sheaf of @xmath79-modules determined by @xmath7 ( the push - forward of its structure sheaf ) , then there are natural isomorphisms @xmath80 for each @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , first - order deformations of @xmath73 as a gc brane correspond to first - order deformations of @xmath78 as a coherent sheaf ( since these are parameterized by @xmath82 ) .    to go deeper into the geometric content of the deformation functor ( and formal groupoid ) associated to a gc brane",
    ", we next take a closer look at the relationship between symmetries of the gc manifold @xmath56 and the deformations of @xmath0 .",
    "it is here we encounter the first fundamental difference from the complex and lagrangian cases described above . in the case of a complex submanifold @xmath7 of a complex manifold @xmath83 , for instance ,",
    "every deformation of @xmath7 is locally induced by a ( local ) symmetry of @xmath83 .",
    "to explain this , consider the case of 1st order deformations , which by theorem [ z tangent ] correspond to holomorphic sections of the normal bundle @xmath31 .",
    "given such a section @xmath84 , for each @xmath85 it is always possible to extend @xmath84 to a holomorphic vector field @xmath86 on some neighborhood @xmath87 of @xmath88 ; heuristically , the corresponding deformation is then given near @xmath88 by  flowing \" @xmath7 along @xmath86 for an infinitesimal time .",
    "an analogous construction in the case of an arbitrary @xmath89 brane is _ not _ always possible , however .",
    "we call deformations that have this property _ locally trivializable_. although an arbitrary gc brane may have deformations which are not locally trivializable , we introduce a large class of branes , which we call _ leaf - wise lagrangian _ ( lwl ) branes , and prove that their deformations are always locally trivializable ( theorem [ essentially surjective ] ) . this is a non - trivial statement about the geometry of such branes , and relies on the existence of a local normal form ( which we prove in theorem [ lwl normal form ] )",
    ".    the final part of the paper is devoted to proving a version of theorem [ z obstructions ] for gc branes .",
    "the result we prove applies only to those branes with locally trivializable deformations ( in particular , by proposition [ essentially surjective ] , to holds for lwl branes ) .",
    "we prove the theorem using the machinery of ( bi)semicosimplicial differential graded lie algebras ( dglas ) , as developed in @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "specifically , by adapting a construction given in @xcite , we construct , for each brane @xmath0 , a dgla @xmath90 ( depending on a choice ) .",
    "we prove that @xmath90 governs the locally trivializable deformations of @xmath0 .",
    "a concrete calculation involving @xmath90 then allows us to prove the following result .",
    "[ brane obstructions ] let @xmath0 be a leaf - wise lagrangian brane on a gc manifold ( or more generally a brane with locally trivializable deformations ) .",
    "if the lie algebroid cohomology group @xmath91 vanishes , then the functor @xmath69 is unobstructed .",
    "this result can clearly be sharpened in various situations : for example , in the case of a lagrangian brane @xmath0 , it is not hard to see that the dgla @xmath90 is ( homotopy ) abelian , so that in this case @xmath92 is always unobstructed .",
    "we leave the problem of strengthening theorem [ brane obstructions]as well as extending it to arbitrary branes  for future work .",
    "in  [ courant algebroid ] through  [ lwl submanifolds ] , we present the definitions and results in gc geometry that will be needed for the rest of the paper .",
    "although much of this material is well - known , there are a few definitions and results that have not  to the best of our knowledge  appeared before .",
    "this includes , for example , the notion of a leaf - wise lagrangian submanifold ( or brane ) , which we introduce in definition [ definition lwl submanifold ] .",
    "our treatment of the symmetries of the standard courant algebroid is also somewhat non - standard . in ",
