    "our recent work@xcite clarified the onset condition of guiding center stochasticity for the passing particles ( guiding center islands widths are inverse proportional to the square root of parallel velocities ) . on the other hand ( while the resonance in the phase velocity is possible ) the radial excursion of trapped particles is limited in finite radial domains .",

    "hereafter , @xmath18 represents time .",
    "the ballooning type electrostatic perturbation is employed in the orbit - following calculation@xcite .",
    "the ballooning mode posses translational invariance@xcite : fourier modes with different @xmath19 ( poloidal mode number ) but the same @xmath20 ( toroidal mode number ) are correlated . while modes with different poloidal / toroidal numbers are orthogonal in a cylindrical geometry , in a toroidal geometry , due to the toroidal curvature @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the major radius , @xmath23 is @xmath22 at the magnetic axis , @xmath24 and",

    "for the passing particles , the transport is much larger for thermal ions than the alpha particles , because the island width is proportional to @xmath50@xcite .",
    "this is because the net @xmath0 drift for resonating particles is larger for the slower particles which spend longer time at the same phase of the driftwave .",

    "the trajectories of trapped particles are not resonant and do not form any islands .",
    "the trajectories are distorted ( invariant tori ) without a topological change .    in fig.4 ,",

    "figure 4 demonstrates that the second adiabatic invariant ( `` @xmath62 '' ) for trapped particles is not easy to break by the background fluctuation ( except for those due to the resonance in the velocity space@xcite ) .    in fig.3 , lower energy trapped particles",
    "are seemingly diffusive but by if one follows the particle orbits for a longer time , they can end up in a long term periodic motion .",

    "the collision frequency for the energy scattering by the electrons is given by the inverse of the energy relaxation time@xcite while the collision frequency for the pitch angle scattering ( test ion particles against bulk ions ) is given by the inverse of the perpendicular momentum relaxation time@xcite .",
