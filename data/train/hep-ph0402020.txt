    "this system can already be called _ the hot vacuum_.    since secondary particle production rates are very large inside the fireball , one may expect an importance of effects , which are beyond the scope of the usually used simple approximation of elastic collisions of free particles and even of a more involved quasiparticle approximation . to describe a system of",

    "the tail of the electron wave function penetrates deeply into the band gap due to multiple electron - phonon collisions @xcite .",

    "the limit is safely fulfilled for @xmath1 , where @xmath48 is the fermion chemical potential .",
    "we develop a general relativistic approach and match it to the non - relativistic one .",
    "we use the term `` hadron liquid '' rather than `` hadron gas '' to stress crucial role of strong coupling . besides we will see that the pion - nucleon - antinucleon attraction is essentially enhanced in the p - wave .",
    "thereby a short range correlation naturally comes into play .    to better understand the physics of the phenomenon we first consider properties of an idealized hadron liquid consisting of strongly interacting fermions of one kind and bosons of one kind .",
    "it is assumed that fermions are essentially heavier particles than bosons .",
    "we argue for the following qualitative picture .",
    "there are several temperature regimes .",
    "the regime @xmath49 corresponds to a _ slightly heated hadron liquid _",
    "( or the hadron vacuum , if the fermion chemical potential @xmath50 ) .",
    "@xmath4 is the temperature , at which the gap between fermion - antifermion continua becomes completely blurred .",
    "typically @xmath51 is of the order of @xmath52 for relevant values of the fermion - boson coupling constant @xmath53 , @xmath54  mev is the pion mass .",
    "bosons are almost free particles in this temperature regime .",
    "fermion distributions begin to deviate from boltzmann distributions due to multiple collisions of each fermion on bosons .",
    "this deviation increases with the temperature increase .    if there exists a temperature interval @xmath55 ( _ a warm hadron liquid , partially blurred fermion continuum _ ) , then the fermion mass shell is already partially blurred due to multiple rescatterings of the fermion on bosons .",
    "the quasiparticle approximation for fermions fails , if the fermion - boson coupling constant @xmath53 is rather large ( e.g. , @xmath56 for @xmath34 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 meson  nucleon ( @xmath59 ) interaction ) . as the result ,",
    "fermion distributions become essentially enhanced compared to the ordinary boltzmann distribution . for realistic hadron parameters the regime of _ a warm hadron liquid _",
    "can be realized only for pions , not for @xmath34 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 due to their large masses .",
    "however the enhancement is not too strong for pions , since @xmath60 ( rather than @xmath61 ) in the latter case .    with further increase of the temperature ,",
    "hadron effective masses substantially decrease . for @xmath62 ( _ hot hadron liquid , blurred boson continuum _ ) , where @xmath63 is the effective boson mass depending on @xmath53 , heavy rather rapid fermions abundantly produce effectively less massive and slower virtual ( off shell ) bosons ( boson tadpole diagram ) and undergo multiple rescatterings on them , as on quasi - static impurities . due to the width effect ( from multiple quasielastic rescatterings )",
    "the fermion propagator completely looses the former quasiparticle pole shape it had in a dilute medium . for @xmath64 fermions",
    "become essentially relativistic particles .",
    "the hot hadron liquid comes to the regime of _ the blurred fermion continuum . _ the fermion sub - system represents then _ a rather dense packing of fermion - antifermion pairs .",

    "( blurred continua for both boson and fermion sub - systems ) . the fermion - antifermion density , @xmath66 grows exponentially with the temperature in a wide temperature interval .",
    "bosons rescatter on fermion - antifermion pairs ( fermion - antifermion loop diagram ) and due to that decrease their effective masses . at a temperature @xmath12 , the effective scalar boson mass may vanish and a _ hot bose condensation _ ( hbc ) may set in by the second order phase transition .",
    "we call it hbc , since the condensate appears for the temperature larger than a critical temperature . for vector and pseudo - scalar bosons ( if the latter interact with fermions via pseudo - vector coupling ) the hbc may arise by the first order phase transition at finite value of @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , for scalar and vector bosons hbc occurs in the s - wave state , whereas for pseudo - scalar bosons with the pseudo - vector coupling to fermions the hbc may arise in the p - wave state . for realistic values of hadron parameters , the problem of the determination of @xmath4 , @xmath21 and @xmath68 is the coupled - channel problem . as the result of its solution",

    "are significantly enhanced with the increase of the temperature .",
    "it is known that at high energies of heavy ion collisions the experimentally observed kaon to pion ratio becomes energy independent .",
    "it is usually associated with the quark deconfinement , cf .",
    "however such a behavior can be also naturally explained within the pure hadron picture . in this sense",
    "one may speak about _ a quark - hadron duality _ : observable can be explained in terms of both the quark - gluon degrees of freedom , cf .",
    "@xcite , and only hadron degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "taking into account multiple scattering effects , the number of hadron degrees of freedom is significantly enhanced simulating the same effects , as from deconfined quarks .    in reality",
    "hadron and quark - gluon degrees of freedom may interact . incorporating the quark structure of hadrons and the possibility of hadron states in the quark matter",
    ", one may expect strong thermal fluctuation effects of the quark - gluon origin in the hadron phase , and strong fluctuation effects of the hadron origin in the quark - qluon state .",
    "thereby , instead of a sharp first or second order hadron - quark phase transition one may expect the existence of a broad region of _ a hadron - quark continuity _ , cf .",
    "arguments for the crossover from lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "thus , more likely , at such conditions the system state represents _ a strongly correlated boiled hadron - quark - gluon porridge ( hqgp ) _ rather than the pure hadron or pure quark - gluon state .",
    "the pure quark - gluon phase probably occurs at a higher temperature , @xmath75 , and a pure hadron phase , at @xmath76 .",

    ", is much larger than the temperature squared , if the coupling constant @xmath53 is rather high ( e.g. , @xmath83 for the @xmath84 interaction ) . then , typical departures of fermion energies from the mass shell are substantially higher than those for bosons .",
    "typical fermion momenta increase with the temperature from non - relativistic values ( @xmath85 ) to relativistic ones ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "these values are significantly higher than typical boson momenta @xmath87 .",
    "it allows one to consider fermions , as hard particles , and bosons , as soft ones , that greatly simplifies the analysis and , actually , solves the problem .",
    "we call such an approximation _ the soft thermal loop _ ( stl ) approximation .",
    "we argue for a huge stopping power in the course of highly energetic heavy ion collisions due to mentioned above multiple collisions . after a short non - equilibrium stage",
    "the system continues to live rather long at a quasi - equilibrium in the center of mass frame undergoing a slow expansion into vacuum . due to a large hadron density and a softening of the vector meson spectrum",
    "the dilepton production is expected to be enhanced , that can be measured .",
    "distributions of particles radiating at the break up stage of the fireball are also enhanced compared to boltzmann distributions at given temperature , since at least a part of a large number of virtual particle degrees of freedom concentrated in the fireball before its break up can be transformed into distributions of particles measured at infinity ( however the value of the enhancement depends on the dynamical mechanism of the break up , cf .",
