    "the bright region traced by the ch2/ch1 ratio map is coincident with the 20 cm radio continuum emission , possibly due to presence of the br@xmath4 ( 4.05 @xmath2 m ) feature in ch2 band around the hii region .",

    "the bubbles ( cn 107 and cn 109 ) are clearly traced by molecular emission in the velocity range of 19 to 21 km s@xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we also estimated velocity dispersion of about 4 km s@xmath3 ( using second moment co map ) around the region , assuming a smooth rotation curve for the galaxy with typical gas dispersion velocity of about 10 km s@xmath3 @xcite . the consideration of velocity ranges of molecular gas in which bubbles are traced ( see fig .",

    "the association of ysos with the collected materials around the region further reveals the ongoing star formation on the edge of bubbles .",
    "+ in addition , we have checked the possibility of intrinsically `` red sources '' contamination , such as agb stars in our yso sample .",
    "recently , @xcite prepared an extensive catalogue of such red sources based on the _ spitzer _ glimpse and mipsgal surveys .",
    "they showed that two classes of sources are well separated in the [ 8.0 - 24.0 ] color space such that ysos are redder than agb stars in this space ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . since",
    ", mips 24 @xmath2 m data is saturated for the g8.14 + 0.23 region , we have therefore used criteria based on the irac magnitude ( 4.5 @xmath2 m ) and color space ( [ 4.5 - 8.0 ] ) , to estimate the agb contamination .",
    "it is believed that the presence of agb stars in the cluster is unlikely ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , we have applied red source criteria for only those ysos which are cluster members with less than or equal to @xmath32 value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10]a ) .",
    "we find that glimpse ysos may be contaminated by agb stars up to about 36% ( 5 out of 14 ysos ; see subsection  [ subsec : phot1 ] ) .",
    "in this subsection , we present sed modeling of some selected ysos to derive their various physical parameters using an on - line sed modeling tool @xcite .",
    "clustering analysis of identified ysos reveals that there is a grouping of ysos ( @xmath15 20 ysos / pc@xmath17 ) close to the peak of the dense molecular gas and the dust clump in the region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10]b ) .",
    "we have selected 8 ysos ( designated as irs 1, ..... ,irs 8) from this cluster close to the dense clump , which are detected atleast upto glimpse 4.5 @xmath2 m or longer wavelengths for sed modeling .",
    "nir and _ spitzer _ irac / glimpse photometric magnitudes for these selected ysos are listed in table  [ tab1 ] along with irac spectral indices ( @xmath33 ) and are also labeled in fig .",
    "[ fig10]b .",
    "irac spectral indices were calculated using a least squares fit to the irac flux points in a log(@xmath34 ) versus log(@xmath34f@xmath35 ) diagram for those sources that are detected in atleast 3 irac bands ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we have not included the mips 24 @xmath2 m magnitude for sed modeling because the image is saturated close to the iras position .",
    "the sed model tool requires a minimum of three data points with good quality as well as the distance to the source and visual extinction value .",
    "a distance range of 3.7 to 4.7 kpc and the visual extinction in the range from 8 to 25 mag are used as input parameters in sed modeling tool for each source to constraint the seds .",
    "these models assume an accretion scenario with a central source associated with rotationally flattened infalling envelope , bipolar cavities , and a flared accretion disk , all under radiative equilibrium .",
    "the model grid consists of 20,000 models of two - dimensional monte carlo simulations of radiation transfer with 10 inclination angles , resulting in a total of 200,000 sed models .",
    "the grid of sed models covers the mass range from 0.1 to 50 m@xmath1 .",
    "only those models are selected that satisfy the criterion @xmath36 - @xmath37 @xmath38 3 , where @xmath36 is taken per data point .",
    "the plots of sed fitted models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] for all the selected sources .",
    "the weighted mean values of the physical parameters ( age , mass , temperature , luminosity , envelope accretion rate ( @xmath39 ) and disk accretion rate ( @xmath40 ) ) along with the standard deviations derived from the sed modeling for all the selected sources are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the table also contains the model - derived weighted mean values of a@xmath28 with standard deviations and the degeneracy of the models ( i.e. , the number of models that satisfy the @xmath36 criterion as mentioned above ) .",
    "the derived sed model parameters show that the average value of mass , age and a@xmath28 of these clustered ysos are about 7.8 m@xmath1 , 0.12 myr and 15.5 mag , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that the embedded irs  1 and irs  2 sources are young and massive protostars .",
    "finally , the sed modeling results favour the ongoing star formation around the region with detection of young ysos as well as some massive candidates in their early phase of formation .",
