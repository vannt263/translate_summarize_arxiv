    "the exclusive semileptonic decays @xmath3 have been measured by the _ babar _",
    "@xcite , belle  @xcite , and lhcb  @xcite collaborations in an effort to unravel the well - known @xmath4 puzzle which has persisted for several years ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the current world averages of the ratios are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which exceed the sm predictions of @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the excess of @xmath11 over sm predictions has attracted a great deal of attention in the particle physics community and has led to many theoretical studies looking for np explanations .",
    "some studies focus on specific np models including two - higgs - doublet models  @xcite , leptoquark models  @xcite , and other extensions of the sm .",
    "other studies adopt a model - independent approach , in which a general effective hamiltonian for the @xmath12 transition in the presence of np is imposed to investigate the impact of various np operators on different physical observables  @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies rely on the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite to evaluate the hadronic form factors , which are expressed through a few universal functions in the heavy quark limit ( hql ) . in the present analysis",
    ", we employ an alternative approach to calculate the np - induced hadronic transitions based on the covariant confined quark model ( ccqm ) , which has been developed in some earlier papers by us ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    here",
    "we follow the authors of  @xcite to include np operators in the effective hamiltonian and investigate their effects on physical observables of the decays @xmath13 .",
    "we define a full set of form factors corresponding to sm+np operators and calculate them by employing the ccqm . in the ccqm",
    "the transition form factors can be determined in the full range of momentum transfer , making the calculations straightforward without any extrapolation .",
    "this provides an opportunity to investigate np operators in a self - consistent manner , and independently from the hqet .",
    "we first constrain the np operators using experimental data on the ratios of branching fractions , then analyze their effects on various observables .",
    "we also derive the fourfold angular distribution for the cascade decay @xmath14 to analyze the polarization of the @xmath15 meson in the presence of np .",

    "% \\langle d^\\ast(p_2 )     \\\\ % \\langle d^\\ast(p_2)|\\bar{c}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}(1-\\gamma^5)b|\\bar{b}^0(p_1)\\rangle & = & -i\\epsilon^\\dagger_{2\\alpha}\\big [ \\left(p^\\mu g^{\\nu\\alpha } - p^\\nu g^{\\mu\\alpha }   + i \\varepsilon^{p\\mu\\nu\\alpha}\\right)g_1^t(q^2)\\\\ & & + \\left(q^\\mu g^{\\nu\\alpha } - q^\\nu g^{\\mu\\alpha } + i \\varepsilon^{q\\mu\\nu\\alpha}\\right)g_2^t(q^2)\\\\ & & + \\left(p^\\mu q^\\nu - p^\\nu q^\\mu   + i\\varepsilon^{pq\\mu\\nu}\\right)p^\\alpha\\frac{g_0^t(q^2)}{(m_1+m_2)^2 } \\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the polarization vector of the @xmath30 meson which satisfies the condition @xmath31 .",
    "the particles are on their mass shells : @xmath32 and @xmath33 . using the helicity technique first described in  @xcite and",
    "further discussed in our recent papers  @xcite , one obtains the ratio of branching fractions @xmath34 as follows : @xmath35",

    "the definition of the hadronic helicity amplitudes @xmath43 in terms of the invariant form factors is presented in the appendix of  @xcite .",
    "note that we do not consider interference terms between different np operators since we assume the dominance of only one np operator besides the sm contribution .",
    "as has been discussed in detail in  @xcite we calculate the current - induced @xmath44 transitions from their one - loop quark diagrams . as a result the various form factors in our model are represented by threefold integrals which are calculated by using fortran codes in the full kinematical momentum transfer region @xmath45 .",
    "our numerical results for the form factors are well represented by a double - pole parametrization @xmath46 the parameters of the form factors for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 transitions are listed in table  [ tab : ff ] .",
    ".parameters of the dipole approximation for @xmath1 form factors .",
    "zero - recoil values of the form factors are also listed for comparison with the hqet . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the trigonometric moments @xmath47 and @xmath48 are equal to zero in the sm and obtain a nonzero contribution only from the right - chiral vector operator @xmath49 , as depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : wiit ] .",
    "both moments are proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath50 and the effect of @xmath49 cancels in their ratio .",
    "one can also consider certain combinations of angular observables where the form factor dependence drops out ( at least in most np scenarios )  @xcite . as a demonstration , we consider the optimized observable @xmath51 which is equal to one not only in the sm but also in all np scenarios except the tensor one , as shown in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : wiit ] .",
    "therefore @xmath52 plays a prominent role in confirming the appearance of the tensor operator @xmath53 in the decay @xmath54 .",
    "recently , the belle collaboration has reported on the first measurement of the longitudinal polarization of the tau lepton in the decay @xmath55 with the result @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "the errors are quite large but this pioneering measurement has opened a new window on the analysis of the dynamics of the semileptonic @xmath57 transitions .",
    "the hope is that , with the belle ii super - b factory nearing completion , more precise values of the polarization can be achieved in the future , which would shed more light on the search for possible np in these decays .    in a recent paper  @xcite we have studied the longitudinal ( @xmath58 ) , transverse ( @xmath59 ) , and normal ( @xmath60 ) polarization components of the @xmath61 in @xmath3 and clarified their roles in the search for np . in",
    "@xcite one can find the @xmath2 dependence of the @xmath61 polarizations in the presence of np operators , which bears powerful information for discriminating between different np scenarios .",
    "for example , it can be used to perform a bin - by - bin analysis to probe np in different @xmath2 regions .",
    "one can also calculate the average polarizations over the whole @xmath2 region .",
    "the predictions for the mean polarizations are summarized in table  [ tab : pol - average ] .     &",

    "when @xmath70 is present , @xmath95 can be as large as @xmath96 , @xmath97 can reach @xmath98 , and @xmath99 can even reach @xmath100 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if one measures @xmath95 and finds any excess over the sm value , it would be a clear sign of @xmath70 .",
    "meanwhile , the @xmath61 longitudinal and transverse polarization components in @xmath55 are more sensitive to @xmath75 .",
    "the coupling @xmath75 can enhance @xmath101 from the sm value of @xmath91 up to @xmath102 , or lower @xmath103 from @xmath104 down to @xmath105 .",
    "notably , the average transverse polarization @xmath97 is almost insensitive to @xmath75 in comparison with @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath75 is present , one finds @xmath106 , which is almost the same as the sm value @xmath107 . in contrast , if @xmath70 is present , one has @xmath108 , which is much lower than the sm prediction .",
    "this unique property of @xmath97 may play a very important role in probing the scalar coupling @xmath70 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the average total polarization @xmath83 is almost insensitive to @xmath70 .",
    "we have provided a thorough analysis of possible np in the decays @xmath3 using the form factors obtained from our covariant quark model . starting with a general effective hamiltonian including np operators",
    ", we have derived the full angular distribution and defined a large set of physical observables .",
    "assuming np only affects leptons of the third generation and only one np operator appears at a time , we have gained the allowed regions of np couplings based on recent measurements at @xmath109 factories , and studied their effects on the observables .",
    "it has turned out that the current experimental data of @xmath110 and @xmath111 prefer the operators @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the operator @xmath53 is less favored , and the operator @xmath114 is disfavored at @xmath115 .",
    "our analysis has been done under the assumption of one - operator dominance . however",
    ", the large observable set has revealed unique behaviors of several observables and provided many correlations between them , which allows one to distinguish between np operators .",
    "our analysis can serve as a map for setting up various strategies to identify the origins of np , one of which is as follows : first , one uses the null tests @xmath116 and @xmath117 to probe the operators @xmath49 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "second , one measures the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath118 has a zero - crossing point , then it is a clear sign of @xmath112 .",
    "the coupling @xmath119 is more difficult to test because it is just a multiplier of the sm operator . however , if the tests above disconfirm @xmath49 , @xmath53 , and @xmath112 at the same time , then the modification of @xmath119 to @xmath110 and @xmath111 is a must . in the future",
    "when more precise data will be collected , one can adopt the strategies described here as a useful tool to discover np in these decays if the deviation from the sm still remains .",
