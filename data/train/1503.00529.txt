    "<S> one of the predictions of our model is a multimodal logarithmic distribution of population sizes . indeed , while the time - aggregated distribution is bimodal with distinct upper and lower peaks , populations within any given diversity wave cluster together in several smaller peaks persisting over several waves ( color stripes in figure [ fig4new]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this overall finding is supported by a growing body of literature @xcite where multi - modal species abundance distributions ( sad ) in real ecosystems were reported for plants , birds , arthropods @xcite , marine organisms including single cells , corals @xcite , nematodes , fishes , entire seafloor communities @xcite , and even extinct brachiopods @xcite . like in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the empirical sads range over many orders of magnitude with a noticeable depletion ( or several depletions ) at intermediate scales . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this dip is usually somewhat less than predicted by our basic model but is consistent with several of its variants described below . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the model variant # 1 inspired by the neutral theory of biodiversity @xcite thought to apply to a variety of ecosystems including microbial communities @xcite ( see s1 figure in supplementary materials ) .    </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , our model is not unique in generating multimodal distributions ( see e.g. @xcite for other examples ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , some of the variants of our model give rise to interesting population dynamics including diversity waves even without any depletion in the middle of the log - binned sad . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a more reliable characterization of underlying dynamical processes can be obtained from time - series data . </S>",
    "<S> first , all systems capable of diversity waves are described by rapid large changes in populations of individual species .    </S>",
    "<S> such sudden , population - scale shifts can occur e.g. due to introduced diseases or the disappearance of keystone species @xcite thereby changing the composition of the entire food - web . on the microbial scale , </S>",
    "<S> sudden invasion of a new bacteriophage may lead to multiple orders of magnitude reduction in the population of susceptible bacteria @xcite , potentially leading to their complete local extinction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phage - driven collapses do not spare bacteria with large populations and may even be biased towards such    as postulated in the kill - the - winner ( ktw ) hypothesis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude and characteristic timescales of population changes in microbial ecosystems is still being actively discussed in the literature . while ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite reports that over half of all bacterial species in marine environments varied between abundant and rare over a three - year period , other studies @xcite found more modest variability at the level of species or genera over weeks to months period </S>",
    "<S> . however , everyone seem to agree on dramatic and rapid ( often on the scale of days @xcite ) population shifts at the level of individual bacterial strains @xcite caused by phage predation @xcite . except for interchangeable gene cassettes ( metagenomic islands ) responsible for either phage recognition cites or alternatively resistance to phages @xcite these strains routinely have very similar genomes and thus may have near identical growth rates . </S>",
    "<S> hence , they are capable of coexistence in the saturated state implicitly assumed in our model .    </S>",
    "<S> extinctions and collapses in our model are assumed to be caused exclusively by exogenous effects such as natural catastrophes or predation by external species not sharing the carrying capacity of our environment . </S>",
    "<S> real - life ecosystems can also collapse due to endogenous effects , i. e. internal interactions between species . </S>",
    "<S> such intrinsic collapse mechanisms were the sole focus of earlier models by us and others ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    on vastly longer , geological timescales , the collapse - driven dynamics of our model </S>",
    "<S> resembles that of species extinctions and subsequent radiations in the paleontological record @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one example is the recolonization by mammals of a number of ecological niches vacated by dinosaurs after the end - cretaceous mass extinction thought to be preceded by a gradual depletion of diversity among dinosaurs who were finally wiped out by a singular catastrophic event @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the extinction rate of taxonomic orders appears to be independent of their size quantified by the number of genera they contains @xcite , which is also one of the assumptions of our basic model of collapse - driven dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the second area of applications of our model is to describe company dynamics in economics . </S>",
    "<S> the size or the market share of a publicly traded company reflected in its stock price is well approximated by a random walk with ( usually ) small incremental steps @xcite . however , as in the case of ecosystems , this smooth and gradual drift does not account for dramatic rapid changes such as bankruptcies or market crashes . in case of companies the main driver of sudden changes </S>",
    "<S> is their debt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the intrinsic value of a company is much smaller than its debt , even small changes in its economical environment can make it insolvent not sparing even the biggest companies from bankruptcies ( think of enron and lehman brothers ) . </S>",
    "<S> empirically , the year - to - year volatility of company s market share varies with its size @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> abundance distributions in our original model and many of its variants are characterized by a power - law tail with an exponent @xmath47 close to @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in approximate agreement with the empirical data on abundance distributions of bacteria in soil samples @xcite , marine viruses ( phages ) @xcite .    in the economics literature , </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of company sizes @xcite , as well as those of wealth of individuals @xcite are known to have similar scale - free tails . </S>",
    "<S> recent data for companies @xcite and personal wealth @xcite suggest @xmath69 tail of the former distribution and @xmath70 tails of the latter one . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , scale - free tails in these distributions were explained by either stochastic multiplicative processes pushed down against the lower wall ( the minimal population or company size , or welfare support for low income individuals ) @xcite , by variants of rich - get - richer dynamics @xcite , or in terms of self - organized criticality @xcite . the emphasis of the latter type of models on large system - wide events ( avalanches @xcite or collapses @xcite ) and on separation of timescales is similar in spirit to the collapse - driven dynamics in our models . </S>",
    "<S> a potentially important socio - economic implication of our model is that during each wave contingent sub - peaks in the `` upstairs '' part of the distribution are imprinted on the  downstairs \" part and thereby can be repeated in the new wave following the `` revolution '' .    </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , our models were simplified in order to compare and contrast the collapse - driven dynamics to other mathematical descriptions of competition in saturated environments . </S>",
    "<S> the s1 text in supplementary materials describes several variants of our basic model that in addition to population collapses include the following elements :    1 .    </S>",
    "<S> `` neutral drift model '' assumes changes of population sizes during time intervals between collapses as described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this model </S>",

    "<S> the diversity dynamics and the scale - free tail of the population distribution becomes sensitive to the extent that the large populations are disfavoured by collapse . </S>",

    "<S> each of the species is also characterized by its own growth rate @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the supplementary s7 figure shows that for intermediate populations the time - aggregated distribution is described by a power law scaling . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the basic model it has a broader scaling regime and larger likelihood to have most of the  biomass \" collected in one species .    </S>",
    "<S> captions to supplementary s1-s7 figures provide more detailed description of model dynamics in each of these cases . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the  simulations of the variants of our basic model described above preserve the general patterns of collapse - driven dynamics such as diversity wave dynamics , and a broad time - aggregated distribution of population sizes with scale - free tail for the most abundant species .     </S>",

    "<S> the classic definition of the fitness of a species in terms of its long - term exponential growth rate @xcite is clearly inappropriate for our model . </S>",

    "<S> some environmental conditions favor the fast growth even at the cost of a higher risk of collapse , whereas other could call for sacrificing growth to minimize probability or severity of collapses . </S>",
