    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) mx@xmath0 ( m = nb , ta , mo , w , x = s , se , te ) have intriguing properties , ranging from insulator to metal and superconductor , and thus always attract extensive interests of experimentalists and theorists .",
    "thanks to their in - plane covalent bondings and weak interlayer van der waals interactions , they could be easily exfoliated down to a monolayer which shows very exotic properties .",
    "for example , bulk mos@xmath0 is an indirect - band - gap semiconductor ,  @xcite while the monolayer mos@xmath0 is a direct - band - gap semiconductor .",
    "@xcite consequently , the tmds have shown exciting prospects for a variety of applications , such as catalysts and lubricants in the petroleum industry  @xcite , promising applications in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics ,  @xcite and energy storage applications .",
    "@xcite    the typical representative of tmds is 2@xmath2-nbse@xmath0 , showing a large charge density wave ( cdw ) ( at 33 k ) that coexists with superconductivity ( @xmath6 = 7.2 k ) .",
    "@xcite niobium disulfide ( nbs@xmath0 ) also belongs to the family of tmd compounds .",
    "but the cdw order appeared in 2@xmath2-nbse@xmath0 is absent in 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 ,  @xcite and its occurrence is suppressed by the large anharmonic effects .",
    "@xcite however , it also shows superconductivity at a similar transition temperature of @xmath6 = 6 k.  @xcite more interestingly , the t@xmath7 of 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 increases smoothly from 6 k at zero pressure to @xmath88.9 k at 20 gpa ,  @xcite also similar to the behavior of @xmath6 in 2@xmath2-nbse@xmath0 which increases to @xmath8 8.5 k at 10 gpa .",
    "@xcite the upper critical field of 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 has an initial decrease as pressure increases , contrary to the increase of @xmath6 , but above 8.7 gpa it increases again with pressure .",
    "@xcite    nbs@xmath0 is a two - gap superconductor , similar to nbse@xmath0 .",
    "the heat capacity of a 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 has been measured down to 0.6 k and in magnetic fields up to 14 t by ka@xmath9mar@xmath9ik _",
    "et al_.  @xcite the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat can be attributed to either the existence of a strongly anisotropic single - energy gap or a two - gap scenario with the large gap about twice bigger than the small one .",
    "the field dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient induces a magnetic field dependence of the superconducting anisotropy .",
    "@xcite the two - gap scenario conclusions are supported by the absence of in - plane gap anisotropy in recent stm imaging of the vortex lattice in nbs@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 has a layered structure and therefore has large anisotropic electrical , optical , and magnetic properties .",
    "it has been applied as catalyst for the purification of petroleum ,  @xcite cathode materials in secondary batteries ,  @xcite humidity sensors ,  @xcite and so on . in experiment , presently the one - layer trigonal 1@xmath1-nbs@xmath0 ,  @xcite two - layer hexagonal 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 ,  @xcite and three - layer rhombohedral 3@xmath3-nbs@xmath0  @xcite heve been synthesized .",
    "large - scale synthesis of 3@xmath3-nbs@xmath0 nanosheets has also been recently realized .",
    "@xcite different low dimensional structures of nbs@xmath0 have different physical and chemical properties .",
    "low dimensional materials depend on and can be exfoliated from bulk materials .",
    "it is necessary to uncover as many crystal structures of nbs@xmath0 as possible . from some new crystals ,",
    "it is expected to exfoliate some new - functional low dimensional materials .",
    "it is known that pressure is able to modulate the properties of materials through changing their crystal structures .",
    "furthermore , the structures of nbs@xmath0 under high pressure are fundamental to understand its superconductive properties .",
    "the mechanism of pressure - induced superconductivity and the superconducting temperature in nbs@xmath0 above 20 gpa still remain unknown to us .",
    "this motivates us to investigate the superconductivity of nbs@xmath0 at higher pressures . in this work",
    ", we first predicted the high - pressure structures of nbs@xmath0 and determined its phase transition sequence using the multi - algorithm collaborative ( mac ) crystal structure prediction technique combined with the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "then we calculated the superconducting critical temperature through electron - phonon coupling calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ compdet ] contains the computational details .",
    "the results and discussion are presented in sec .",

    "[ concl ] .",
    "in order to determine the high - pressure structures of nbs@xmath0 , we searched its low - energy structures from 0 to 200 gpa using our developed mac crystal structure prediction technique .",
    "@xcite the multi algorithms including the evolutionary , the simulated annealing , and the basin hopping algorithms are combined to collaboratively search the global energy minima of materials with the fixed stoichiometry . the mac algorithm and all the relevant techniques",
    "are incorporated in the muse code .",
    "@xcite the results were also carefully cross checked and confirmed by the calypso code ,  @xcite which is based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "optimizations for every structure generated by the muse code were performed with vasp package .",
    "@xcite we tested the local density approximation ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) parametrized by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite for exchange correlation energy .",
    "the two approximations give the similar structures order in structure prediction . while the lda calculated lattice constants are better than the gga for nbs@xmath0 .",
    "so in the static calculations , we adopted the lda exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the electron - ion interactions are described by the projector augmented wave ( paw ) scheme .",
    "@xcite the pseudopotentials for nb and s have the valence electrons configurations of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . to achieve good convergences the kinetic energy cutoff and the _ k_-point grids spacing",
    "were chosen to be 500 ev and 0.02 @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the accuracies of the target pressure and the energy convergence for all optimizations are better than 0.1 gpa and @xmath13 ev , respectively .",
    "the searched systems contained 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 and 18 atoms in the unit cell .",
    "in our mac structure searches ,  @xcite the structures were generated with symmetry constraints in the first generation and optimized with vasp package at fixed pressures .",
    "the pressures applied to crystal structures in optimizations go from 0 to 200 gpa with the interval of 20 gpa . at each fixed pressure ,",
    "the enthalpies of these structures were calculated and compared to find the proper path towards the lowest - enthalpy structure .",
    "results show that the previously known 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 has the lowest enthalpy at lower pressures ( below 20 gpa ) and the @xmath4 structure has the lowest enthalpy at higher pressures ( above 20 gpa ) .",
    "the previously known 1@xmath1- and 3@xmath3-nbs@xmath0 structures were also easily reproduced . the large - scale 3@xmath3-nbs@xmath0 nanosheets",
    "are synthesized very recently.@xcite more interestingly , we found a new two - layer hexagonal structure whose energy is very close to 3@xmath3-nbs@xmath0 at ambient pressure .",
    "we refer to it as 2@xmath2@xmath14-nbs@xmath0 . according to energy criterion",
    ", it is potential to be synthesized in experiment .",
    "meanwhile , many other structures were found to be energetically competitive , including @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 structures , and so on . among these structures , the trigonal @xmath15 structure has lower energy with respective to the known 3@xmath3-nbs@xmath0 in the whole pressure range of interest .",

    "the kinetic energy cutoff , the energy cutoff for the electron density , and the * k * grids were chosen to be 40 ryd . , 400 ryd . , and 16@xmath2616@xmath2616 monkhorst - pack ( mp )  @xcite meshes in both total energy and phonon dispersion calculations , respectively .",
    "we applied the gaussian smearing method with the smearing width of 0.05 ryd .",

    "for the 2@xmath2- and 2@xmath21-nbs@xmath0 , the * q * grid meshes are 2@xmath264@xmath264 , also giving 8 wave vectors .",
    "phonon dispersion curves ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ph139](b ) and [ fig : ph194](a ) ) do not show any imaginary frequencies , indicating dynamical stability of @xmath4- and 2@xmath21-nbs@xmath0 .",
    "so we believe @xmath4- and 2@xmath21-nbs@xmath0 are both mechanically and dynamical stable . the phonon dispersion curve of 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 are also presented in fig .  [ fig : ph194](b ) , compared to the experimental data .",
    "@xcite the agreement of our calculated phonon frequencies and the 300 k experimental data is quite good . by comparing the phonon dispersion curves of 2@xmath2- and 2@xmath21-nbs@xmath0 , we note the phonon frequencies of 2@xmath21-nbs@xmath0 exhibit softening near to a point ( along the @xmath27-a , a - l and h - a directions ) , implying its metastability compared to 2@xmath2 structure .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions from the elastic constants calculations .",
    "we calculated the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 of nbs@xmath0 using the allen - dynes  @xcite form of the mcmillan  @xcite equation , @xmath28 ,    \\label{mcmillan}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the electron - phonon coupling constant , @xmath31 the logarithmic average frequency , and @xmath32 the coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "the logarithmic average frequency is calculated by @xmath33 the eliashberg spectral function , @xmath34 , which measures the contribution of the phonons with frequency @xmath35 to the scattering of electrons ,  @xcite can be written as ,  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the edos at the fermi level .",
    "the linewidth of the phonon mode was calculated from ,  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electron - phonon coupling matrix element .",
    "the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath32 was taken the typical value 0.10 in all the superconducting critical temperatures ( @xmath6 ) calculations .",

    "[ fig : tc ] , compared with recent experimental data .",
    "@xcite the resulting @xmath6s of 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 are in very good agreement with experiment and increase with pressure .",
    "it is interesting that the @xmath6 of @xmath4 structure is higher than that of 2@xmath2 structure and decreases with pressure .",
    "this is resulted from the stronger electron - phonon coupling coefficients @xmath29 in @xmath4-nbs@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] ) .",
    "the phonon calculations indicate that @xmath4 is unstable below 10 gpa .",
    "the highest @xmath6 of @xmath4 ( at 10 gpa ) is 17.83 k. from the electronic energy band structure of @xmath4-nbs@xmath0 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : ph139](a ) ) , we note it is metallic . it is previously known that 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 is also metallic , so pressure does not change the metallic properties of nbs@xmath0 , but enhances the electron - phonon coupling effects and thus increases the the superconducting critical temperature .",
    "in conclusion , we predicted three new 2@xmath21- , @xmath15- , and @xmath4-nbs@xmath0 structures using the mac crystal structure prediction technique . the new 2@xmath21-nbs@xmath0 can be formed by shifting the layer of atoms along typical direction parallel to the layer plane . based on enthalpy calculations , we found 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 transits to the tetragonal @xmath4 structure at 26 gpa .",
    "the new bondings in @xmath4 form a [ nbs@xmath5 hexahedron , which has not been reported in tmd crystals . more interestingly , the superconducting temperature of @xmath4-nbs@xmath0 is higher than that of 2@xmath2-nbs@xmath0 and decreases as pressure increases , resulted from the stronger electron - phonon coupling coefficients @xmath29 in @xmath4-nbs@xmath0 . in the stability region of @xmath4 structure ,",
