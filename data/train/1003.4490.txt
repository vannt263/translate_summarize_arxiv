    "the use of atom chips to trap neutral atoms and cool them down to temperatures of the order of @xmath3 kelvin has opened a wide range of possibilities for fundamental studies and applications requiring a high degree of control of an atomic system .",
    "an atom chip is a centimetre - scale device that integrates wires or permanent magnets ( or both ) in a flat geometry to generate the large magnetic field gradients required to confine neutral atoms at distances of the order of a few to a few hundred micrometres from the surface of the atom chip .",
    "micro - fabricated magnetic traps for neutral atoms were first experimentally realized by j. reichel _",
    "@xcite in 1999 , and by r. folman _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in 2000 , using surface - mounted wires on an atom chip .",
    "atom chips offer the advantage of flexible trap configurations that range from single traps to arrays of multiple traps , as well as the possibility of integrating all elements necessary for trapping , cooling , transporting and detecting atoms into a single compact geometry .",
    "atom chips have been used for a wide variety of fundamental studies , for example : to investigate the behaviour of bose - einstein condensates as coherent matter waves in experiments such as atomic beam splitters or atomic interferometers @xcite ; to study low - dimensional quantum gases @xcite ; to explore atom - surface interactions @xcite , etc .",
    "other applications of atom chips include for instance the use of ultra - cold atoms as magnetic field sensors @xcite with high field sensitivity and high spatial resolution , and the experimental realisation of miniaturized atomic clocks @xcite which could be incorporated into global positioning systems ( gps ) and navigation systems .",
    "atom chips also offer a promising experimental approach towards the implementation of quantum information processing with neutral atoms @xcite , since they can combine the accurate control of an atomic quantum system with coherent manipulation and integrated detection tools @xcite in a miniaturized device with good prospects for scalability .",
    "more details can be found in the atom chip review of reference @xcite , and references therein .",
    "+ the work described in this paper has been carried out with neutral @xmath4rb atoms on a permanent - magnet atom chip made of videotape .",

    "several permanently - magnetized atom - chip designs have been investigated theoretically @xcite as well as from a technical point of view @xcite .",
    "the use of videotape to build an atom chip offers the advantage of miniaturized magnetic patterns that generate strong magnetic fields ( up to @xmath5 at the chip surface ) and strong field gradients ( a few @xmath6 ) . the pattern of permanent magnetisation can be chosen according to the needs of the experiment . in our case ,",
    "the recorded magnetisation is sinusoidal with a wavelength of @xmath7 , allowing the confinement of rubidium atoms with temperatures between a few hundred @xmath8k and a few hundred nk , in arrays of miniature magnetic micro - traps .",
    "an advantage of videotape is the fact that it is made of insulating material .",

    "section [ sec : fragmentation ] describes a study of roughness of the trapping potential and fragmentation of atom clouds trapped in very close proximity to the surface of the atom chip .",
    "section [ sec : transport ] describes an effective method of transporting cold atoms in videotape magnetic traps over large distances of the order of 1 cm , as a tool to increase the degree of control over the trapped atoms and to survey the surface of our videotape atom chip .",
    "more details about previous work on these two subjects are given at the beginning of sections [ sec : fragmentation ] and [ sec : transport ] .",

    "finally , a method for reducing fragmentation is outlined and discussed in the context of our videotape atom traps .      as described in section [ sec : thechip ] , the periodic , in - plane magnetisation recorded in the videotape along the _ x _ direction should generate a magnetic field with components only in the _ x_-_y _ plane ( see equation ( [ eqn : videofield ] ) ) .",

    "noise in the other components has a negligible effect since it only causes a slight transverse displacement of the trap centre .",
