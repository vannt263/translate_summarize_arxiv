    "the ctap process for cold atoms considers a system of three micro - traps , between which a single particle can tunnel ( see fig .  [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the strength of the tunneling is determined by the distance and barrier height between the individual traps .",
    "if one assumes all traps to be of the same shape , i.e.  have resonant energy levels , and only allows for adiabatic processes , one can write the hamiltonian in terms of the asymptotic eigenstates of the individual traps , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as @xmath2 the @xmath3 are the tunneling matrix elements between neighbouring traps and we assume the tunneling between non - neighbouring traps to be negligible .",
    "the eigenstates and eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are well known @xcite and we will focus here on the so - called dark eigenstate given by @xmath4 this state only has an indirect contribution from the central trap through the mixing angle , @xmath5 , and its energy eigenvalue is given by @xmath6 .",
    "if one allows for time - dependent tunneling rates , this state can be used to transfer a particle from , say , trapping site @xmath7 to @xmath1 with large fidelity , even in the presence of noise @xcite .",
    "note that during this transfer the particle has no probability to ever be in the state @xmath8 .    to remind the reader ,",
    "let us briefly review this transfer process : the tunneling frequencies can become functions of time either through a time - dependent variation of the distance between the individual traps , through a modulation of the respective barrier heights or through a combination of both of them . here",
    "we will assume that the trap positions change in time and , since we will assume piecewise harmonic potentials , this will also lead to a decrease in barrier height .",
    "if we therefore first decrease the distance @xmath9 and , with a delay , the distance @xmath10 , we create the familiar counter - intuitive stirap timing sequence for the values of the tunneling strengths @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3level ] ( a ) and ( b ) and calculations below ) . during this process",
    "the mixing angle @xmath13 changes from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3level ] ( c ) ) , which allows a particle initially trapped on the left hand side to be transferred to the trap on the right hand side .",
    "this is the essence of the celebrated stirap technique .    to calculate the tunneling frequency between two traps as a function of trap distance ,",
    "let us turn to the exactly solvable model system of piecewise harmonic traps @xcite , which also guarantees good approximate resonance between the levels at any point in time @xmath16 the eigenfunctions of this potential are known to be given by parabolic cylinder functions @xcite @xmath17 & &     \\quad\\text{for}\\quad x\\le 0\\;,\\\\    \\psi_2(x)&=n_2d_\\nu\\left [ \\frac{2m\\omega}{\\hbar}(x-\\frac{d}{2})\\right ] & &     \\quad\\text{for}\\quad x\\ge 0\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the normalisation constants .",
    "the eigenenergies are given by @xmath20 and the quantum numbers , @xmath21 , are determined by requiring that the logarithmic derivatives of the two wavefunctions are equal at @xmath22 @xmath23 by solving this condition we can exactly calculate the tunneling strength between the two traps at any time during the adiabatic process . if we then diagonalise eq .",
    "we find the eigenvalues displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3level](d ) , where the dark state with the eigenvalue of zero is clearly visible .",
    "since we assume that the whole process is carried out adiabatically , the system will be in this state at any point in time .        in order to write down the hamiltonian for a realistic system",
    "a number of approximations must hold .",
    "first , the eigenstates of the isolated traps have to be in close resonance , and second , the levels of the individual traps have to be chosen such that they are well isolated from all other available states in the system",
    ". the second condition can almost always be fulfiled by making the process more adiabatic and the first one translates into the simple requirement that all traps have the same trapping frequency ( in case of harmonic traps ) .",
    "for realistic traps , however , this is problematic , as potential forces often add when they start to overlap .",
    "several solutions have been proposed for this , including the use of time - dependent compensation potentials @xcite . here",
    "we assume that this is experimentally possible , as it allows us to isolate the physics relevant to the dynamics of the phase .    to examine the influence of the ctap dynamics on the phase distribution of a quantum state",
    "let us first carry out a full numerical integration of the schrdinger equation for a general system .",
    "this will at the same time function as a control mechanism for the approximations made above , in particular the fact that we neglected non - nearest neighbour coupling and treated tunneling as a one - dimensional process . for numerical simplicity",
    ", however , we will only consider a two - dimensional setup here , as this will allow us to capture the main physical processes . in scaled co -",
    "ordinates schrdinger s equation is therefore given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the trapping potential of the three traps in the linear configuration and which fulfils the conditions outlined above . for generality ,",
    "all lengths are scaled with respect to the ground state size of the individual harmonic traps , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mass of the particle and @xmath28 the trapping frequency of the individual harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "all energies are scaled in units of the harmonic oscillator energy , @xmath29 .    to be specific ,",
    "let us choose an initial state that carries a single quantum of angular momentum and therefore has a phase distribution that increases by @xmath30 for a closed loop around the centre of the state .",
    "this state is initially located in the trap on the left hand side .",
    "the results of the numerical integration are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : angularmomentum ] and show surprising dynamics : while the process still leads to a 100% transfer of the probability amplitude to the trap on the right hand side ( not shown ) , the angular momentum of the final state oscillates continuously between clockwise and counter - clockwise depending on the overall duration of the process ( see upper part of the figure ) .",
    "four examples of this change in phase and density associated with four different durations are shown in the lower half of the figure . in the first example ( a )",
    "the system is in exactly the same state as it started out with , whereas in ( b ) the circulation of the flow has been reversed by the ctap process . the plots ( c ) and ( d ) show the situation where the final state is in a superposition between clockwise and counter - clockwise rotation , which also leads to a strongly modified density distribution",
    ".        this behaviour might seem surprising at first , as angular momentum is usually thought of as a conserved quantity .",
    "however , in non - rotationally symmetric geometries this conservation law does not hold and in fact can lead to interesting dynamics for vortices in anisotropic potentials @xcite . as in our example",
    "the particle is tunneling between rotationally symmetric potentials , it is not a priori clear where the necessary asymmetry comes from .    to gain insight into this behaviour ,",
    "let us return to the three state model and consider the transport of a particle in a harmonic oscillator potential carrying one unit of angular momentum . in two dimensions",
    "its energy is given by @xmath31 and the state is doubly degenerate , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we therefore have to write the most general wavefunction as the superposition @xmath34 where the one - dimensional , single particle eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator for the ground and first excited state are given by @xmath35 .",
    "we have also allowed for a relative phase @xmath13 between the two degenerate states , however we can set this initially to zero without loss of generality .",
    "as our traps are arranged in a linear configuration along the @xmath36-axis we can assume that the dynamics in the different spatial directions decouple .",
    "tunneling therefore needs to be taken into account only for the wavefunction part in the @xmath36-direction and we find that the hamiltonian can be split into one for the ground state parts of the wavefunction and one for the excited states @xmath37 and @xmath38 unlike in the previous section , we can not simply set the diagonal elements equal to zero as now both the ground state and first excited energies are involved .",
    "however , each of the hamiltonians has still a dark eigenstate with the eigenvalues @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "if initially a single particle is in the trap on the left hand side in the state given by eq .",
    ", after the ctap process , the hamiltonians above lead to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the overall duration of the process and the superscripts @xmath43 ( left ) and @xmath44 ( right ) refer to the traps the wavefunction is localised in .",
    "note that although we have used scaled energy units , we reintroduce @xmath28 into the above expressions for clarity .",
    "one can immediately see that if @xmath39 and @xmath40 are not independent of time , the wavefunction acquires a relative phase between the two degenerate states that is dependent on the overall duration of the ctap process @xmath45}\\nonumber\\\\       & + i\\varphi_0^r(x)\\varphi_1^r(y )       e^{-i\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\omega t_f+\\int_0^{t_f}\\epsilon_1(t')dt'\\right]}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for easier understanding let us rewrite the above state by defining a global and a relative phase as @xmath46 @xmath47dt'\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that we can write the final state as @xmath48\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can clearly see from this that any slight deviation in the difference between the asymptotic energy levels of the individual traps will have a significant effect on the final wavefunction . as , in particular , in realistic situations the shape of the individual potentials most likely strongly changes , one can expect to be unable to control the final form of the wavefunction . the ctap process is therefore unstable with respect to states with non - trivial phase distributions @xcite .",
    "however , as our example shows , this does not have to be a random process and in fact it can be used to engineer the phase of the wavefunction deterministically : by slightly changing the overall time of the process , one can cycle through all possible states for the fixed energy @xmath31 .",
    "since in our simulations the potentials are piecewise harmonic , it is not immediately clear where the change in energies comes from .",
    "let us therefore in the following carefully examine our model and determine the influence of various other degrees of freedom .",
    "the crucial point is that during the ctap process the energy eigenstates in the @xmath36-direction slightly change , since the potentials we are considering are only piecewise harmonic . by bringing them closer together , the height of the barrier between them changes , leading to a different asymptotic eigenstate .",
    "in fact , the eigenstates are very close to the parabolic cylinder functions defined above .",
    "as the first excited eigenstate is closer to the local maximum separating the traps , it will be shifted differently compared to the ground state . while the difference might only be small , the integration over a long",
    ", adiabatic time interval will lead to a large value for the integral . to demonstrate this , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : en ] the energies for an atom in the state @xmath49 and @xmath50 during the ctap process .",
    "it can be clearly seen that at the time of approach the energy eigenvalues slightly changes , as assumed above . in addition , we show that their difference , which is the integrand of eq .  [ eq : theta ] , is not constant and thus gives rise to the time dependant @xmath51 .     ( blue dashed ) , @xmath40 ( green dot - dashed ) and @xmath52 ( red solid ) over the course of the ctap process .",
    "both energies are initially separated by @xmath53 , but do not maintain this separation due to the modification of the potential as the traps move closer together . ]    from the above argument it follows that the effect should not only depend on the overall time of the process , but also on the minimum distance to which the traps approach each other . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmin ] , we show the resulting oscillations of angular momentum for a number of different values for @xmath54 . as the minimum distance is increased , the period of the oscillations increases as well ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : dmin ] ) , which is in accordance with the explanation given above : a larger minimum distance between the traps means that the energy levels are deviating less from the asymptotic values for perfect harmonic potentials .",
    "let us finally discuss the effect of a non - linearity on the evolution of the phase .",
    "the paradigm of an atomic non - linear system of well defined phase is a bose - einstein condensate and its dynamics can be described by the so - called gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath58 here @xmath59 is a measure for the non - linearity , which is related to the scattering strength between the atoms @xcite . while the ctap process requires resonances of the three asymptotic ground state at any time , non - linear samples break this due to the time dependence of a chemical potential , @xmath60 , during the tunneling process . for large chemical potentials",
    "the whole process therefore defaults and one has to resort to different techniques for restoring the resonance during the process @xcite . as we are only interested in the phase dynamics , we will restrict ourselves to only small non - linearities ( @xmath61 ) , for which about 100% transfer can still be reached .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nl ] we show the effect a small , but increasing non - linearity has on the final phase .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the oscillatory behaviour of the angular momentum does not get immediately suppressed by the non - linearity , and that the only effects are an offset and a small reduction in periodicity ( not shown ) .",
    "we therefore speculate that the effect described in this work can also be used to create vortex superposition states in bose - einstein condensates in a controlled way , as long as the samples are only weakly interacting . as it is well known that vortex oscillations in an anisotropic potential can be suppressed for large enough non - linearities @xcite , it might be interesting to study this effect in the presence of resonance restoring techniques .",
    "we have shown that the spatial ctap process for atoms in microtraps does not conserve the wavefunction form for states with non - trivial phase distribution .",
    "this is due to an unavoidable small time dependence of the asymptotic eigenstates of the individual traps , which results from the overlap between them .",
    "as any currently suggested realistic systems shows large deformations due to the overlap , our work directly applies to current experimental setups .    at the same time",
    "we have shown that this instability behaves deterministically with respect to a change in the overall time of the ctap process and can therefore be used to create well defined angular momentum superposition states .",
    "such states can have applications in quantum information and have recently seen a surge in interest  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the presented process even survives in the presence of small non - linearities , allowing therefore to superpose vortices in bose - einstein condensates .",
