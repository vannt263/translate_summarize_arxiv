    "attempts to categorify the cluster algebras of fomin and zelevinsky @xcite have led to the investigation of categories with the 2-calabi - yau property ( 2-cy for short ) and their cluster - tilting objects .",
    "main early classes of examples were the cluster categories associated with finite dimensional path algebras @xcite and the preprojective algebras of dynkin type @xcite .",
    "this paper is centered around the more general class of stably 2-cy and triangulated 2-cy categories associated with elements in coxeter groups @xcite ( the adaptable case was done independently in @xcite ) , and their relationship to the generalized cluster categories from @xcite ( see section 4 for the definition ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite connected quiver with vertices @xmath9 , and @xmath1 the complete preprojective algebra of the quiver @xmath0 over a field @xmath2 .",
    "denote by @xmath10 the distinguished generators in the corresponding coxeter group @xmath11 . to an element @xmath3 in @xmath11 ,",
    "there is associated a stably 2-cy category @xmath12 and a triangulated 2-cy category @xmath13 .",
    "the definitions are based on first associating an ideal @xmath14 in @xmath1 to each @xmath15 , hence to any reduced word by taking products .",
    "this way we also get a finite dimensional algebra @xmath16 .",
    "objects of the category @xmath12 are submodules of finite dimensional free @xmath5-modules .",
    "the cluster category is then equivalent to @xmath13 with @xmath17 , where @xmath7 is a coxeter element such that @xmath18 is a reduced expression @xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 is a preprojective algebra of dynkin type , then the category @xmath19 as investigated in @xcite is also obtained as @xmath12 where @xmath3 is the longest element ( * ? ? ?",
    "* iii 3.5 ) .    using the construction of ideals we get for each reduced expression",
    "@xmath20 a chain of ideals @xmath21 which gives rise to an interesting set of @xmath1-modules : @xmath22 which all turn out to be indecomposable and to lie in @xmath12 .",
    "the investigation of this set of modules , which we call _ layers _ , from different points of view , including connections with tilting theory , is one of the main themes of this paper , especially for a class of words called @xmath7-sortable .",
    "the modules @xmath23 provide a natural filtration for the cluster - tilting object @xmath24 associated with the reduced expression @xmath25 ( see section 1 ) .",
    "these modules can be used to show that the endomorphism algebras @xmath26 are quasi - hereditary @xcite . here",
    "we show that these modules are rigid ( theorem [ 2spherical ] ) , that is @xmath27 and that their dimension vectors are real roots ( theorem [ realroot ] ) , so that there are unique associated indecomposable @xmath8-modules @xmath28 ( which are not necessarily rigid ) .",

    "starting with the tilting @xmath8-module @xmath8 ( when @xmath32 ) , there is a natural way of performing exchanges of complements of almost complete tilting modules , determined by the given reduced expression .",
    "we denote the final tilting module by @xmath33 , and the indecomposable @xmath8-modules used in the sequence of constructions by @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "we show that @xmath36 is a @xmath8-module in this case and that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 ( theorem [ lequalt ] ) and we also show that the indecomposable modules in the torsionfree class @xmath39 are exactly the @xmath34 ( theorem [ twtilting ] ) . in particular this gives a one - one correspondence between @xmath7-sortable words and torsionfree classes , as first shown in @xcite using different methods ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there is another sequence @xmath40 of indecomposable @xmath8-modules , defined using restricted reflection functors , which coincide with the above sequences .",
    "this is both interesting in itself , and provides a method for proving @xmath37 for @xmath35 .    in another paper @xcite ,",
    "we give a description of the layers from a functorial point of view .",
    "when the @xmath7-sortable word is @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , then the successive layers are given by @xmath43 for the indecomposable projective @xmath8-modules @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the ar - translation .",
    "in the general case we will give a description of the layers using specific factor modules of the above modules .",
    "the generalized cluster categories @xmath46 for algebras @xmath47 of global dimension at most two were introduced in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for a special class of words @xmath3 , properly contained in the dual of the @xmath7-sortable words , the 2-cy category @xmath13 is triangle equivalent to some @xmath46 .",
    "we point out that the procedure for choosing @xmath47 works more generally for any dual of a @xmath7-sortable word ( theorem [ equivalence ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with some background material on 2-cy categories associated with reduced words , on complements of almost complete tilting modules and on reflection functors . in section 2",
    "we show that for any reduced word @xmath3 , the associated layers are indecomposable rigid modules , which also are positive real roots . hence there are unique associated indecomposable @xmath8-modules . in section 3",
    "we show that our three series of indecomposable modules @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 coincide in the @xmath7-sortable case .",
