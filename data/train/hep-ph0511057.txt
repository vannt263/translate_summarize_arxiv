    "the number of fermion families in nature and the pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles are two of the most intriguing puzzles in modern particle physics .",
    "the 3 - 3 - 1 extension of the standard model ( sm ) of the strong and electroweak interactions , based on the local gauge group @xmath0 , provides an interesting attempt to answer the question on family replication .",
    "in fact , this extension has among its best features that several models can be constructed so that anomaly cancellation is achieved by an interplay between the families , all of them under the condition @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of families and @xmath3 is the number of colors of @xmath4 ( three - family models)@xcite .",
    "two 3 - 3 - 1 three - family models have been studied extensively over the last decade . in one of them",
    "the three known left - handed lepton components for each family are associated to three @xmath5 triplets as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is related to the right - handed isospin singlet of the charged lepton @xmath8 in the sm @xcite . in the other model the three @xmath5 lepton triplets are of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is related to the right - handed component of the neutrino field @xmath11 ( a model with right - handed neutrinos)@xcite . in the first model anomaly cancellation implies quarks with exotic electric charges @xmath12 and @xmath13 , while in the second one the extra particles have only ordinary electric charges .",
    "our aim in this paper is to carry a phenomenology analysis of the 3 - 3 - 1 model in the version that includes right - handed neutrinos with a minimal content of higgs scalars @xcite .",
    "we are going to set updated constraints on several parameters of the model ( including those related to the weak neutral currents ) , to check if the model can be embedded into a simple gauge group structure , and most important , to check if the model can reproduce realistic results as far as the fermion mass spectrum is concerned .",
    "we already know , from the analysis presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , that models based on the 3 - 3 - 1 local gauge structure are suitable to describe some neutrino properties , because they include in a natural way most of the ingredients needed to explain the masses and mixing in the neutrino sector .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite addresses this issue in the context of the model studied here .",
    "even though we are going to concentrate mainly in other aspects of the model , we will show an alternative way to produce tiny neutrino masses with maximal mixing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] we review and present some novel features of the model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] we study the fermion mass spectrum , and in sec .  [ sec : sec4 ] we fix the mixing angles between the flavor diagonal neutral currents present in the model . in sec .",

    "@xmath35 coincides with the weak neutral current of the sm . using eqs .",

    "notice that this model does not contain exotic charged leptons , and universality for the known leptons in the three families is present at tree level in the weak basis .    with these quantum numbers it is just a matter of counting to check that",

    "our analysis , even tough producing a messy spectrum , is full of physical content , and it seems to contradict the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where a three - family standard model of particles can be embedded only into a group of rank eight or larger ( as for example @xmath66 ) .",
    "the point here is that the extra fields in eq .",

    "the usual analysis shows that this set of vev breaks the symmetry in one single step @xmath72 for the particular value @xmath73 , the symmetry breaking chain becomes @xmath74 which in turn allows for the matching conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the gauge coupling constants of the @xmath79 and @xmath37 gauge groups in the sm , respectively .",
    "then , for @xmath73 the sm becomes a low energy theory of this particular 3 - 3 - 1 gauge structure .",
    "we will see in the next section that this scalar structure properly breaks the symmetry and provides with masses for the gauge bosons , but it is not enough to produce a consistent mass spectrum for the quark sector , and at least one more higgs triplet , which does not develop vev , must be introduced .",
    "after breaking the symmetry with @xmath80 , and using the covariant derivative for triplets @xmath81 , we get the following mass terms in the gauge boson sector .      in the basis @xmath82 , the square mass matrix produced by the vev of the scalar fields is @xmath83 a symmetric mass matrix having eigenvalues @xmath84 and @xmath85 , related to the physical fields @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",

    "notice that for @xmath73 there is no mixing between the two charged gauge bosons , and the mass for the known physical gauge boson @xmath95 is not altered .",
    "a crude value for @xmath93 can be estimated at this point in the following way : by using for the mass of @xmath96 the experimental value given above , and using the relationship @xcite @xmath97 with @xmath98 ( the @xmath99 mass calculated from the sm ) , and @xmath100 tev , we get @xmath101 , which in turn implies @xmath102 gev , small than the electroweak scale any way , with the largest value for @xmath103 coming from the large experimental and theoretical errors in the value for @xmath104 .",
    "we are going to show below that @xmath93 must be very small since it is related to the mass scale of the neutrinos in the model .",
    "for the five electrically neutral gauge bosons we get first , that the imaginary part of @xmath105 decouples from the other four electrically neutral gauge bosons , acquiring a mass @xmath106 .",

    "during the last decade several 3 - 3 - 1 models for one and three families have been analyzed in the literature , the most popular one being the pleitez - frampton model @xcite which is certainly not the simplest construction .",

    "@xcite .    for the model presented in this paper we have studied the mixing of the two charged gauge bosons and its implications .",
    "also we analyzed the mixing of the three electrically neutral gauge bosons and set limits for the mixing angles using precision measurements of the electroweak sector .",
    "there are in this model three mass scales : the 3 - 3 - 1 scale @xmath100 tev , the electroweak scale @xmath179 gev , and a new very small scale @xmath93 proportional to the neutrino mass scale    by the use of a discrete @xmath180 symmetry we have constructed an appealing mass spectrum for the fermions in this model ; in particular we have carried a program with a minimum set of higgs scalars ( three ) and vev in which : the exotic fermions get heavy masses at the tev scale ; the quarks @xmath181 and @xmath182 get tree - level masses , with the ordinary up quark sector getting masses at the @xmath183 scale and with a hierarchy between the up and down sectors ; the mass for the @xmath184 quark is suppressed by differences of yukawa couplings , and the other ordinary quarks , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , get radiative masses , with the @xmath180 symmetry responsible of the weak isospin breaking .",
    "the quark mass spectrum constructed in this way is just one example of how to proceed .",
    "different discrete symmetries and extra scalar higgs fields with and without vev may be used in order to avoid hierarchies and produce a more realistic mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the neutrino masses and oscillations have been analyzed for this 3 - 3 - 1 model in ref .",
    "@xcite using a different approach from the one sketched here .",
    "in particular these authors use four @xmath5 scalar triplets instead of three , one of them with zero vev as in this model , plus one charged scalar , three more @xmath5 singlets of neutral spin 1/2 particles ( one per family ) , and the extra assumption of a diagonal mass matrix for the charged leptons . in the main text we have proposed an alternative way of generating tiny neutrino masses with large mixing , but a detailed analysis of our proposal is beyond the aims of this paper .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have presented original results completing previous analysis of the 3 - 3 - 1 model with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "first , the bounds on the mixing parameters of the neutral currents have been updated .",
    "but most important , our higgs sector and vev are different from the ones introduced in previous papers .",
    "they imply quite different mass matrices for gauge bosons and fermion fields , and a quite different phenomenology .",
    "the most important fact about our higgs sector is that it allows for an acceptable fermion mass spectrum",
    ". then we identify , for the first time for this model , the quark mass eigenstates ; this allows us to do a consistent phenomenological analysis and to set reliable bounds on new physics coming from heavy neutral currents .",
    "it is worth noticing that the same scalar sector and vev structure we have considered , have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to show that , by allowing for a nonzero and small vev @xmath93 , the spontaneous breaking of the lepton number can be implemented in the model .",
    "a new results to remark is also the embeding of this 3 - 3 - 1 structure into @xmath59 .    the maybe unpleasant hierarchies present in the model can be avoided by introducing more higgs scalar fields and new vev , but again , the analysis is beyond the reach of this paper @xcite .",
