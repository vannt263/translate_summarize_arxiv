    "the quantitative description of both nuclear structure and reactions on the same footing is a major challenge of contemporary nuclear theory . with new experimental facilities such as frib and fair at the horizon , the task to find improved approaches for nuclear reactions has become very urgent . _",
    "ab initio _ approaches to calculate nuclear scattering observables are limited by the computational complexity of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "scattering models perform well but use a number of uncontrolled approximations that make the errors of such calculations difficult to quantify .    faced with these problems , it is important to note that there are a number of systems in the chart of nuclei for which the effective number of degrees - of - freedom is significantly smaller than the number of nucleons .",
    "this phenomenon is known as clustering , with alpha clustering , e.g. in the hoyle state of @xmath1c , being the most prominent example .",
    "clustering becomes even more extreme for so - called halo nuclei which consist of a tightly - bound core nucleus and a few weakly - bound valence nucleons @xcite .",
    "this reduction in the number of degrees of freedom is the signature of a separation of scales in the system . in the case of a one - nucleon halo nucleus , the scale separation is manifest in the small ratio of the one - nucleon separation energy and the binding and excitation energies of the core . for typical momenta on the order of the one - nucleon separation energy , it allows for a systematic low - energy expansion in the ratio of these two scales .",
    "this expansion can then be employed to calculate nuclear observables in a model - independent and systematically improvable manner .",
    "this approach is called halo effective field theory ( halo eft ) @xcite when a field - theoretical approach is used for the construction of the interaction and the calculation of observables .",
    "halo eft employs the minimal number of degrees - of - freedom ( core and valence nucleons ) and parameterizes the interaction in terms of a few measurable parameters .",
    "in addition , so - called core polarization effects become important if the core has low - lying excited states .",
    "these can be taken into account by including excited states of the core as explicit degrees of freedom in the effective theory .",
    "neutron halo nuclei occur rather frequently in the chart of nuclei along the neutron dripline and have been studied in halo eft @xcite .",
    "proton halo systems exist too , but are less common due to the delicate interplay between attraction from the strong interaction and the repulsion from the coulomb interaction .",
    "the effects of the coulomb interaction were first included into an eft with contact interactions by kong and ravndal @xcite .",
    "proton halos were considered recently in refs .",
    "@xcite . the coulomb interaction introduces a new scale into the problem that can be understood as a result of the presence of a coulomb barrier .",

    "the introduction of a coulomb momentum can complicate the power counting since it interferes with the separation of scales . higa _",
