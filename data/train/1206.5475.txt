    "the dynamics of a quarter - car model is governed by the road profile excitations and nonlinear suspension characteristics @xcite .",
    "these elements were discussed separately using simplified models and jointly by considering the more realistic description of a vehicle motion .",
    "for instance verros et al @xcite proposed a quarter - car model with a piecewise linear dynamical characteristics . according to the adapted control strategy",
    ", the damping coefficient switched between two different values .",
    "gobbi and mastinu @xcite considered a two dof model to derive a number of analytical formulae describing the dynamic behaviour of passively suspended vehicles running on randomly profiled roads .",
    "their linear model approach was generalized by von wagner @xcite who determined a corresponding high - dimensional probability density by solving the fokker - planck equations .",
    "finally , in papers @xcite dynamics , bifurcations and appearance of chaotic solutions were discussed .",
    "however the main issues of vehicle dynamics studies were unwanted and harmful vibration responses generated by vehicle as an effect of a rough surface road profile kinematic excitation @xcite thus the efficient reduction of them is still a subject of research among automotive manufacturers and research groups @xcite .",
    "turkay and akcay @xcite considered constraints on the transfer functions from the road disturbance to the vertical acceleration , the suspension travel , and the tire deflection are derived for a quarter - car active suspension system using the vertical acceleration and/or the suspension travel measurements for feedback .",
    "the recent experimental and theoretical studies involved many new applications of active and semi - active control procedures @xcite . consequently , previous mechanical quarter car models @xcite have been re - examined in the context of active damper applications .",
    "dampers based on a magnetorheological fluid with typical hysteretic characteristics have a significant expectation for effective vibration damping in many applications @xcite .",
    "recent efforts have been also focused on studies of the excitation of an automobile by a road surface profile with harmful noise components @xcite .",
    "noise like chaotic vibrations , appearing due to the system nonlinearities , have been investigated in simplified single dof models @xcite .",
    "these papers follows the rich literature on an escape phenomenon in the symmetric and nonsymmetric duffing or helmholtz potentials @xcite , where critical system parameters were determined .",
    "note that the condition for escape could be applied as a criterion of fractality in basins of attraction and also as a transition to chaos @xcite . on the other hand , more sophisticated models of vehicle dynamics ,",
    "namely half - car and full - car models , in the context of nonlinear response including chaotic solutions have been studied by zhu and ishitobi and also by wang et al .",
    "@xcite .    to study a transition to the chaotic region and the corresponding critical parameters in low dimension dynamical system analytically , the melnikov theory @xcite is often advocated .",
    "the application of this approach to a simple quarter - car model has been recently proposed by li et al . , and litak et al . @xcite .",
    "in the above papers , a single dof model was used because of its simplicity .",
    "consequently , the analytic consideration included also multiple scales analysis and harmonic balance @xcite .",
    "the present paper is the continuation of the previous studies with an extension to a more realistic two dof model , which includes the sprung and unsprung masses ( fig .",
    "[ fig_a / a ]    our article is organized in 4 sections .",
    "after introduction in the present section ( sec .",
    "1 ) we present the model and discuss possibility of a global homoclinic bifurcation ( sec .",
    "2 ) . by the reduction of dimension",
    "we introduce the foundations of the melnikov approach to the model . in this section ( sec .",
    "2 ) we obtain the principal result as a critical curve which define the system parameters regions of regular and non - periodic ( chaos , transient chaos or escape ) behaviour .",
    "the simulation results , illustrating that transition results are also shown .",
    "further results including recurrence analysis confirming the theoretical predictions are provided in sec .",
    "3 . finally in sec .",
    "4 we end up with conclusions and final remarks .",
    "we start the analysis from the two dof model presented in fig .",
    "the dynamics of vehicle excited by the road profile quarter car model is governed by nonlinear suspension characteristics . to examine a transition to the chaotic regime of vibrations ,",
    "the melnikov theory has been recently proposed @xcite . in this perturbation",
    "approach the authors of previous works used a single dof model .    in the present note",
    "we go beyond this assumption by considering an extension of a vehicle model with the defined unsprung and sprung masses ( fig .",
    "[ fig_a / a]a ) .",
    "the differential equations of motion for both masses have the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 denote the corresponding sprung and unsprung masses ( fig . [ fig_a / a ] ) @xmath3 and describes the harmonic corrugation of a road profile . @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( for @xmath6 , 2 ) @xmath7 @xmath8 are damping and stiffness coefficients , respectively .",
    "now we define the new variable @xmath9 of the relative motion : @xmath10    to adjust the above equations to application of the higher dimensional melnikov approach @xcite , the above equations can be approximated by introducing a small parameter @xmath11 : @xmath12    consequently , the second equation ( eq . [ eq_move2 ] ) gets the new form : @xmath13    using melnikov approach @xcite for @xmath14 coordinate equation ( eq .",
    "3 ) we study the hamiltonian system of the nodal kinetic energy defined at the saddle points . in this way , time variability of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are negligible .",
    "the above equations can be rewritten in the dimensionless form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are dimensionless parameters . for further consideration",
    "we assumed that the system parameters are : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the excitation frequency and the corresponding amplitudes used in the analysis have been fixed to @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the numerical simulations we used the sampling time @xmath32 .    to analyze a homoclinic bifurcation in the sprung mass vibration we make further approximation .",
    "the role of the small parameter @xmath11 is to determine the heteroclinic trajectory and decouple the equations of motion into separate equations for sprung and unsprung masses .",
    "thus after above normalizations the equations can be expressed :    @xmath33    interestingly , in the limit of small @xmath11 limit , @xmath34 can be approximated as : @xmath35 note that in the above expression @xmath36 , generated by slowly changing terms with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is plating a role of the static displacement while @xmath37 as an amplitude .",
    "thus , the unperturbed equations ( for @xmath38 ) can be obtained from the gradient of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath39 : @xmath40    where @xmath41 is defined as follows : @xmath42 the corresponding effective potential is given by the expression : @xmath43    following the standard melnikov theory @xcite , we get the heteroclinic orbits connecting the two hyperbolic saddle points ( coinciding with the maxima of the potential @xmath44 ( eq . 12 ) ) : @xmath45 .",
    "they can be expressed analytically as : @xmath46 , \\nonumber   \\\\ & & v^*=\\frac{{\\rm d}y^*(t)}{{\\rm d } t}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2\\cosh^2   \\left[(t - t_0)\\frac{\\sqrt{2a_3}}{2}\\right]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after perturbations the heteroclinic orbits the stable and unstable manifolds are calculated .",
    "because of perturbations they are detracted ( fig .",
    "3 ) . as the characteristic distance between them @xmath47 the system possibilities of mixed solutions ( regular and escape ) appear which is equivalent to irregular chaotic and chaotic transient solutions .",
    "thus @xmath48 is the ideal criterion for chaos appearance .",
    "formally , the distance @xmath49 between perturbed stable and unstable manifolds are proportional to the melnikov integral ( fig .",
    "3 ) @xmath50 @xcite which can be written :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 denotes a wedge product , the differential form @xmath53 is the gradient of the unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath54 is related to the perturbation part , and @xmath55 is an integration constant .",
    "both forms are defined on unperturbed heteroclinic orbit stable and unstable manifolds @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57    thus , after substitution the above forms to the melnikov function @xmath58 ( eq .",
    "14 ) we get :    @xmath59    the condition for a global homoclinic transition , corresponding to a horse - shoe type of stable and unstable manifolds possible cross - section , can be written as :    @xmath60    consequently , the critical parameter @xmath61 is now @xmath62    the results of the above analysis are presented in fig .",
    "4a . the curve separate the region of regular solutions from the chaotic and escape ones .",
    "the black points represents the parameters used for numerical simulations . to show this region of parameters fig .",
    "4b magnifies the surrounding area .",
    "the corresponding time histories are presented in fig . 5a and b. note that in purpose of simulations we used eqs .",
    "78 with @xmath63 .    note that fig .",
    "5a shows the mono frequency while fig .",
    "5b more complex responses ( multi - frequency or irregular ) .",
    "this is clearly visible in fig .",
    "6a and b where we show the corresponding phase diagrams . in fig .",
    "6a one can see a single line while in fig .",
    "6b lines are split into characteristic three lines patterns .",
    "it is worth to mention that the melnikov criterion ( eq .",
    "18 and fig .",
    "4 ) specifies the global transition associated with the destruction of borders between basins of attractions belonging to different solutions . in our case one of basin",
    "is related to escape from the potential well .",
    "the irregular solution denoted as no . 2 in fig . 4 , ( see also figs .",
    "5b , 6b ) must be related to such an escape . really if someone continue the calculations for long enough time interval one observe the escape in the plot on time series ( fig .",
    "7a ) and on the phase portrait ( fig .",
    "7b ) , respectively .    focusing on the above solutions we discuss the recurrence properties of numerical results with more details in the next section .",
    "the numerical solutions of the regular and transient nature can be analyzed more carefully by the recurrence plots .",
    "this method is basing on the recurrences statistics and can be described by the matrix form @xmath64 with corresponding 0 and 1 elements : @xmath65 are usually defined in the embedding space of @xmath66 dimension and @xmath67 is the threshold value . here",
    "indices @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the sampling instants . in our case",
    "we decided to use the @xmath70 and the embedding space includes the displacements of sprung and unsprung masses : @xmath71 $ ] ( eqs .",
    "78 with @xmath63 ) .    having 0 and 1 values to be translated into the recurrence diagram as an empty place and a coloured dot respectively ( see fig . 9 ) . here",
    "@xmath72 denotes the theiler window used to exclude identical and neighbouring points from the analysis @xcite .",
    "webber and zbilut @xcite and later marwan and collaborators @xcite developed the recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) for recurrence plots .",
    "shortly after invention @xmath73 were addressed to the biological and physiologic systems @xcite .",
    "recently this method has been applied for several technical systems @xcite the first parameter of the rqa analysis defining the correlation function is the recurrence rate @xmath74 : @xmath75 which calculates the number of recurrences . in our case theiler window @xmath76 in order to get the consistency with correlation sum @xcite . in this language @xmath67",
    "expresses the correlation length of the characteristic sphere radius in the embedded space .",
    "note that the correlation sum is the important tool which could be used to derive correlation dimension @xmath77 .",
    "for small enough @xmath67 :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the arbitrary length .    furthermore the rqa can be used to identify topological structures of diagonal and vertical lines . in its frame rqa",
    "provides us with the probability @xmath80 or @xmath81 of line distribution according to their lengths @xmath82 or @xmath83 ( for diagonal and vertical lines ) .",
    "practically they are calculated @xmath84 where @xmath85 or @xmath83 depending on diagonal or vertical structures in the specific recurrence diagram .",
    "@xmath86 denotes the unnormalized probability for a given threshold value @xmath67 . in this way",
    "shannon information entropies ( @xmath87 ) can be defined for diagonal line collections @xmath88    other properties , such as determinism @xmath89 and laminarity @xmath90 :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 and @xmath93 denotes minimal values which should be chosen for a specific dynamical system . in our calculations",
    "we have assumed @xmath94 .",
    ".summary of recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) for @xmath70 and @xmath95 for 1 and 2 solutions ( see .",
    "4 - 6 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "determinism @xmath89 is the measure of the predictability of the examined time series and gives the ratio of recurrent points formed in diagonals to all recurrent points .",
    "note in a periodic system all points would be included in the lines .",
    "on the other hand laminarity @xmath90 is a similar measure which corresponds to points formed in vertical lines .",
    "this measure indicates the dynamics behind sampling point changes .",
    "the results of our analysis calculated for time series 1 and 2 ( see fig . 4 - 6 ) are presented in fig .",
    "9 where we present the results of rp for @xmath95 .",
    "note that both plots show regular features .",
    "however fig .",
    "9a is composed of full diagonals lines only , while in fig .",
    "9b each 5 line is full and between them one observes short line pieces or even insulated points .",
    "this would indicate multi - frequency modulated solution",
    ". could be also a transient with basic regular and superimposed chaotic solutions . to shine this difference with more lights",
    "we show some estimated rqa parameters in tab .",
    "1 . obviously @xmath74 is smaller for 2 ( fig .",
    "9b ) as we have broken lines instead of full ones ( fig .",
    "9a ) . moreover determinism and laminarity ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) are smaller smaller telling that that system is less regular .",
    "consequently the more peculiar distribution of line lengths is confirmed by @xmath87 which is larger for the solution 2. additionally , in fig .",
    "10 we present the results of @xmath74 versus @xmath11 ( for relatively small @xmath11 ) .",
    "one can see the significant difference between both solutions .",
    "we have analyzed the two dof quarter - car model , assuming that damping , suspension through the unsprung mass excited by the road profile corrugation can act as an perturbation on the main sprung mass .",
    "the obtained melnikov criterion was latter confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "the main conclusion coming from that point would be loss of stability of system appearing as the chaotic or transient chaotic or escape solution .",
    "the present investigation is going beyond research dealing with a single dof quarter - car model @xcite .",
    "in particular , the single dof model assumes that the unsprung mass is significantly smaller than the sprung mass .",
    "one should note that the model used in this paper , however more realistic than previous single - degree - of - freedom ones , is relatively simple and would not be sufficient to simulate the detailed response of a vehicle or compare to experimental results from real vehicles .",
    "unfortunately , more sophisticated half - car and full - car models @xcite can not be used in the frame of the presented approach as the heteroclinc trajectories could not be defined reliably . furthermore ,",
    "in higher dof systems the analytic perturbation calculations are not possible .",
    "however , the present quarter - car model is able to capture the major nonlinear effects that occur in vehicle dynamics and has demonstrated the transition to chaotic vibrations and synchronization phenomena @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the resulting critical amplitude curve ( fig .",
    "19 ) has the maximum for @xmath96 and the minimum for @xmath97 .",
    "the minimum is obviously related to the resonance region of the decoupled unsprung solution @xmath34 ( eqs . 8 and 9 ) .",
    "it should be also noted that the recurrence plots technique appeared to be very useful to study the transient signals .",
    "thus the conclusions came from the analytic approach have been confirmed . indeed , this method is designed for the short time series @xcite interestingly it also works for non - stationary signals @xcite .",
    "the recurrences for rp and rqa analyzes have been obtain using the available commandline code written by marwan @xcite .",
    "the recurence approach can be also used to higher dof models of vehicle dynamics .",
    "the corresponding results on half and full vehicle models will reported in a separate paper .",
