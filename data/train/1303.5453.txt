    "newton s theory of gravity was formulated in a flat , euclidean 3-d space but its basic laws , i.e. the poisson equation and the equation of motion , @xmath5 make perfect sense in a 3-d space with an arbitrary geometry @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , the curvature of space is ( potentially ) present in newton s theory .",
    "it is easy to argue that the `` centrifugal '' acceleration of a particle moving with velocity @xmath7 on a circular orbit equals @xmath8 , and the `` gravitational '' acceleration in the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric body with the mass @xmath9 equals @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the curvature radius of the circle , and @xmath12 being its circumferential radius . in flat ,",
    "i.e. euclidean , 3-d space these two radii are equal , @xmath13 , but in a space with a  non - zero gaussian curvature @xmath14 , they are different , @xmath15 . therefore , by measuring centrifugal and gravitational accelerations one may independently measure @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and thus _ experimentally _ find whether the space is flat ( euclidean ) or it has a  non - zero gaussian curvature @xmath16 . based on that , abramowicz has recently suggested in @xcite that a newtonian physicist could experimentally determine the metric @xmath6 of the real physical 3-d space and calculate , according to ( [ poisson - equation ] ) and ( [ equation - of - motion ] ) , the perihelion of mercury advance and the light bending effects . in this paper",
    "we follow this suggestion and calculate both effects within newton s theory .",
    "surprisingly , the values of the perihelion advance and the light bending agree ( to the expected order of @xmath17 ) with predictions of einstein s theory .",
    "here @xmath18 is the `` geometrical '' mass of the spherical gravitating body expressed in the convenient `` geometrical '' units @xmath19 .",
    "it is connected to the mass @xmath9 expressed in the standard units by @xmath20 and has the dimension of length .",
    "0.2truecm another point discussed in this paper is based on the following two remarks : ( _ i_)obviously , newton s gravity theory is a limit of einstein s general theory of relativity .",
    "should the limit _ necessarily _ correspond to @xmath21 ?",
    "perhaps not , because newtonian physicists could discover _ within _ newton s theory that @xmath22 .",
    "( _ ii_)they could also discover that the curvature of space depends on the distance from the gravity center , @xmath23 . this would suggest to them , again _ within _ the framework of newton s theory , that gravity and curvature are not independent , but instead they are somehow linked . here",
    "we suggest that it is possible to establish the link within an `` enhanced '' version of newton s theory , by adding to its standard version defined by ( [ poisson - equation ] ) and ( [ equation - of - motion ] ) an extra equation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ricci scalar corresponding to @xmath6 , @xmath4 is the density of matter , and @xmath26 is a constant . equations ( [ poisson - equation ] ) , ( [ equation - of - motion ] ) and ( [ egr - ricci ] ) define our enhanced version of newtonian gravitational theory . in the special case of a spherically symmetric , vacuum ( @xmath27 ) space , they _",
    "uniquely _ lead to the 3-d metric of the form , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a constant .",

    "see e.g. @xcite , section 3.4 .",
    "let us consider a curve in space given by a parametric equation , @xmath41 where @xmath42 are coordinates in space , and @xmath43 is the length along the curve .",
    "if a body moves along this curve , its velocity equals , @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the speed of the body and @xmath46 is a unit vector tangent to the curve ( [ parametric - equation ] ) , i.e. the direction of motion .",
    "the acceleration may be calculated as follow , @xmath47 assuming circular motion with constant velocity , @xmath48 const , and applying ( [ curvature - radius ] ) to calculate the term in brackets , we arrive at @xmath49 which is the well known formula for the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "consider now circular motion around a spherically symmetric center of gravity .",
    "the newtonian equation of motion , @xmath50 , takes the form , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the gravitational force , and @xmath53 is the gravitational potential .",
    "three quantities characterize motion on a particular circular orbit : the angular velocity @xmath54 , the angular speed @xmath55 , and the specific angular momentum @xmath56 .",
    "they are related by , @xmath57 using ( [ velocity - speed - momentum-2 ] ) , and multiplying its left side by @xmath58 , we transform the equation of motion ( [ equation - motion ] ) into a form which will be convenient later , @xmath59 in this expression , @xmath60 is a unit , _ outside pointing _ , vector . here",
    "`` outside '' has the absolute meaning  outside the center , in the direction towards infinity .",
    "we will calculate the left - hand side of this equation in the next section .",
    "in an empty space , the gravitational potential @xmath53 obeys the laplace equation , @xmath61 let us integrate ( [ laplace ] ) over the volume @xmath62 that is contained between two spheres , concentric with the gravity center , with sphere @xmath63 being inside sphere @xmath64 .",
    "we transform the volume integral into a surface integral , using the gauss theorem @xmath65 the oriented surface elements on the spherical surfaces @xmath63 and @xmath64 may be written , respectively , as @xmath66 therefore , @xmath67 this means that the value of the integral is the same , say @xmath68 , for all spheres around the gravity center . in addition , because of the spherical symmetry of the potential , the quantity @xmath69 is constant over the sphere of integration .",
    "thus , @xmath70 combining ( [ one - sphere ] ) with ( [ equation - motion-1 ] ) , we may finally write , @xmath71 this is the kepler third law . using natural units for radius and frequency ,",
    "@xmath72 we may write the formula for the keplerian angular velocity as , @xmath73",
    "suppose that we slightly perturb a test - body on a circular orbit .",
    "this means that its angular momentum will not correspond to the keplerian one , @xmath74 , given by ( [ kepler - angular - momentum ] ) , but will be slightly different @xmath75 .",
    "there will be also a small radial motion with velocity @xmath76 and acceleration @xmath77 . from ( [ equation - motion-1 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath78 keeping the first order term in equation ( [ perturbation ] ) , and using @xmath79 we arrive at the simple harmonic oscillator equation , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the radial epicyclic frequency , @xmath82 using equations ( [ kepler - angular - momentum ] ) and ( [ gravitational - frequency ] ) , we may write the expression for the epicyclic frequency in the form , @xmath83 or comparing this with ( [ kepler - angular - velocity ] ) , @xmath84 in a flat space , @xmath34@xmath85@xmath12@xmath85@xmath11 , and therefore @xmath81@xmath85@xmath54 , which implies that the slightly non - circular orbit is a closed curve , indeed an ellipse . in a curved space with @xmath14@xmath86@xmath87 ,",

    ". we can also usefully calculate the derivative @xmath106 , as only the derivative , not the absolute value of @xmath107 is of interest .",

    "knowing the space geometry , given by equation ( [ newtmetric ] ) , we may calculate the effect of _ light bending _ assuming that light travels along geodesic lines in space . in newton s theory",

    "jrgen ehlers pointed out in 1961 that in einstein s theory the curvature of the rest - space of irrotational matter is determined by its distribution and relative motion ( see 1221 in his article @xcite ) .",
    "the equations governing such 3-space curvature for arbitrary irrotational flows are given in @xcite ; see their equation ( 54 ) .",
    "consequently it makes sense to consider gravitational dynamics in the context of 3-dimensional curved riemannian spaces .",
    "as newtonian theory is an approximation to general relativity theory , it is therefore interesting to see what happens in the case of newtonian theory in a curved 3-dimensional background space .    in the case of isometric flows , @xmath139 and",
    "there is a potential such that @xmath140 where the gravitational potential @xmath141 relates the killing vector @xmath142 to the unit 4-velocity @xmath143 by @xmath144 ( see 1234 in ehlers @xcite ) .",
    "then the relevant equation becomes @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the 3-dimensional covariant derivative , @xmath4 is the energy density of matter , and we have assumed anisotropic stress is zero ( @xmath147 ) and a vanishing cosmological constant . here @xmath148 is the metric of the three - spaces orthogonal to @xmath143 .",
    "this case will include static spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
