    "there is an overwhelming evidence that the description of the observed universe can not rely only on the assumption of the copernican principle , on the general relativity , and on the standard model of particle physics , eventually extended to include a dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "we shall define _ dark energy _ as anything which represents the failure of some of these assumptions : _",
    "i ) _ it could be a signature of the dynamical effect of inhomogeneities , not properly averaged when accounting for the background dynamics  @xcite . _",
    "ii ) _ gravitational interactions ( on cosmological scales ) could be not described by the hilbert - einstein action , requiring e.g. the inclusion of higher - order terms as in scalar - tensor theories of gravity  @xcite or a formulation in more than four dimensions , as in braneworld scenarios or superstring theories  @xcite .",
    "_ iii ) _ dark energy is an effective `` matter '' field , often dubbed quintessence  @xcite , not clustering on the observed scales and possibly coupled to the matter fields  @xcite , provided the weak equivalence principle is preserved .",
    "a combination of these options is the last possibility , like in extended quintessence scenarios  @xcite .",
    "one can therefore define _ classes _ of models , characterized by definite observational and experimental signatures  @xcite .",
    "the weak gravitational lensing by large scale structures , or _ cosmic shear _ , is a geometrical observable which depends on both background evolution and structures formation  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is a promising tool to investigate dark energy , allowing one to explore in unbiased way the low - redshift universe where dark energy mostly acts  @xcite .",
    "cosmic shear has been exploited to investigate ordinary quintessence scenarios , considering a parametrization of the quintessence equation of state  @xcite .",
    "we move towards `` physics''-inspired models , for the first time using real data along this strategy  @xcite .",
    "this requires a general formulation of weak - lensing , which we achieve just supposing that gravitation is described by a metric theory  @xcite .",
    "every galaxy defines a light bundle , or congruence of null geodesics @xmath0 deviating from a fiducial , arbitrary geodesic @xmath1 by a displacement @xmath2 , converging at the observer position @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 ) , and whose tangent vectors @xmath5 are solution of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( we take the affine parameter @xmath8 vanishing in @xmath3 and increasing toward the past ) . the shape of the light bundle is described by a deformation tensor @xmath9 , whose evolution along the fiducial geodesic ( defined by @xmath10 ) is deduced from the geodesic deviation equation for @xmath2 . on the plane",

    "the use of parameterizations for the quintessence equation of state generally assumes a friedmann - robertson - walker universe , thus excluding a priori other options for the dark energy sector .",
    "moreover , every parametrization is affected by the choice of a dataset - dependent pivot redshift  @xcite , by the consistency with a model for the speed of sound determining the formation of structure , and by the large number of parameters required to suitably account for a `` realistic '' dynamics over a wide range of redshift  @xcite . dealing with `` physics''-inspired models one would overcome these problems , aiming to investigate if a class of theory is compatible with observations at low and high redshift .",
    "we explore two ordinary quintessence scenarios , realized by a self - interacting scalar degree of freedom @xmath49 with ratra - peebles ( rp ) and supergravity ( sugra ) potentials @xmath50 which guarantee the ( partial ) solution of the coincidence problem  @xcite .",

    "although calibrated on @xmath58cdm @xmath59-body simulations , they provide a quite safe recipe also for qcdm models , provided the linear regime is properly taken into account using the correct linear growth factor and the spectra normalized to high - redshift ( by cmb ) . indeed , the @xmath49-field mostly acts on the background dynamics affecting the onset of the non - linear regime , while the successive evolution on small scales ( affecting the structure of single galaxies / halos , bias , etc . )",
    "is essentially dictated by astrophysical processes .",
    "we combined virmos - descart , cfhtls - deep , and cfhtls - wide/22  deg@xmath60 top - hat shear variance data ( see  @xcite for references ) to investigate the sensitivity to the description of the non - linear regime  @xcite .",

    "interestingly , the quintessence parameter space @xmath61 seems not to be sensitive to non - linear gravitational clustering , probing that quintessence primarily acts on geometry .    combining the cosmic - shear data with the `` goldset '' of supernovae ia ( snia )  @xcite ,",
    ", one can safely constraint rp models ( @xmath62 at 95% ) because of the strong degeneracy between the two observables .",
    "more care is needed for sugra models , where the superposition of likelihood contours is severely dependent on reliability of their location , ultimately dependent on systematics .",
    "eventually , one can extract the value of the mass scale @xmath51 , whose contours follow the estimate @xmath63 which holds as long as @xmath64 .",

    "this is useful to compare the models at hand with other classes of models  @xcite , and with the dynamical constraints @xmath71 ( solid line ) , corresponding to a @xmath49-field s speed of sound @xmath67 , and @xmath72 ( dashed line ) , characterizing the so - called `` freezing '' models .",

    "this analysis points towards the gain achievable by a very - wide survey , for which the quality image requirements very likely need space - based observations .",
    "we thus forecast the improvement on the rp and sugra models considering a dune - like mission  @xcite , a shallow survey covering @xmath83  deg@xmath60 .",
    "the results depicted in illustrate the gain with respect to the full cfhtls - wide survey .",
    "it has to be stressed , however , that this estimation is based on an approximate distribution of sources , assumes a perfect correction of the point spread function , and finally is marginalized over a small number of cosmological parameters .",
    "using a general formulation of weak - lensing valid for every metric theory of gravity , we dispose of tools to study several classes of the dark energy sector at both low and high redshift , avoiding the use of parameterizations which difficult a safe combination of data sets and can hardly match any well - defined theory .",
    "we investigate two classes of ordinary quintessence models by means of real cosmic shear data , and combining with supernovae data , putting forward the interest of using cmb data to normalize the spectra and thus define the onset of the non - linear regime of structures formation .",
