    "it is possible to manipulate the state of a quantum system in far more interesting ways than can be achieved by carrying out unitary operations and von neumann measurements on the system of interest alone .",
    "consideration of the effects of interactions with other systems has led to the development of the quantum operations formalism@xcite , which allows any completely positive , trace - preserving map to represent , in principle , a realisable transformation of the density operator @xmath0 .",
    "one particularly interesting type of operation is a probablistic operation .",
    "this is an operation which , with some probability less than 1 , will transform the state of the system in a manner which can not be brought about by any deterministic process .",
    "although such operations generally have a non - zero failure probability , one generally knows whether or not the desired transformation has taken place .    an important class of probablistic operations are those which allow one to discriminate unambiguously between non - orthogonal states , that is , with zero probability of error .",
    "when carried out on a quantum system prepared in one of the non - orthogonal states @xmath1 , such an operation will , with some probability , transform the state into a corresponding member of an orthonormal set @xmath2 .",
    "the latter states can be discriminated without error using a simple von neumann measurement .",
    "although such an operation can not have unit probability of success , we can always tell whether or not the desired transformation has taken place .",
    "when the attempt fails , we obtain an inconclusive result .",
    "the subject of unambiguous state discrimination was pioneered a decade ago by ivanovic@xcite , dieks@xcite and peres@xcite , and has recently undergone interesting further developments . while earlier work concentrated only on the problem of discriminating between two states , the problem of discriminating between multiple states has since been addressed . in particular , one of us@xcite",
    "has shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for a set of states @xmath1 to be amenable to unambiguous state discrimination is that they must be linearly - independent .",
    "more recently , the problem of discriminating between three states has been examined in detail by peres and terno@xcite .",
    "we have shown that unambiguous discrimination is intimately related to other well - known types of probablistic operation , such as entanglement concentration@xcite and exact cloning@xcite .",
    "the latter connection has also been examined by guan and duo@xcite .",
    "unambiguous discrimination between two non orthogonal states has been demonstrated in the laboratory by huttner _ et al_@xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "weak pulses of light were prepared in non - orthogonal polarisation states , a fraction of which were converted into orthogonal ones by a loss mechanism .",
    "it is clearly of interest to find the optimum strategy for discriminating unambiguously between a set of known states , that is , to determine the maximum probability of obtaining a definite result . as with problems in conventional quantum detection theory@xcite , where the aim is to find the _",
    "absolute _ maximum of the discrimination probability or mutual information for a given source , few analytic solutions for optimum strategies and their respective figures of merit are known .",
    "the complete solution for unambiguous discrimination between two states with arbitrary _ a priori _ probabilities has been found by jaeger and shimony@xcite . peres and terno@xcite have explored the geometry of the optimisation problem for three states , and obtained useful insight into the general @xmath3 state case .",
    "as yet , however , no analytical solutions have been found for more than two states .",
    "such a solution is given in this paper .",
    "we determine the maximum probability with which @xmath3 symmetric states can be unambiguously discriminated , assuming they have equal prior probabilities .",
    "we then apply our result to examine the maximum probability of discriminating between @xmath3 symmetric coherent states @xmath4 .",
    "consider a quantum system prepared in one of @xmath3 pure quantum states @xmath1 , where @xmath5 .",
    "these states span an @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "if the states are non - orthogonal , no quantum operation can deterministically discriminate between them .",
    "it is , however , possible to devise a strategy which , with some probability , will reveal the state with zero error probability . to see how this may be done ,",
    "it is convenient to employ the kraus representation of quantum operations@xcite .",
    "each of the possible , distinguishable outcomes of an operation , which are labelled by the index @xmath7 , is associated with a linear transformation operator @xmath8 .",
    "these form a resolution of the identity    @xmath9    if the system is prepared with the initial density operator @xmath10 , the probability @xmath11 of the @xmath12th outcome is @xmath13 .",
    "the final density operator corresponding to this result is @xmath14 .",
    "the state discrimination operation will have @xmath15 distinct outcomes , corresponding to detection of each of the states , and an additional answer which gives no information about the state .",
    "this is the inconclusive result .",
    "the operator which corresponds to the detection of the state @xmath1 is @xmath16 , where @xmath5 , and we let @xmath17 be the operator which leads to a failure of the discrimination attempt .",
    "clearly , we have    @xmath18    the zero - errors condition takes the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the conditional probability , given that the system was prepared in the state @xmath1 , that this state will be identified .",
    "this zero - errors condition can only be met if the @xmath1 are linearly - independent , and we find that the @xmath16 have the form@xcite : @xmath21 where the @xmath2 form an orthonormal basis for @xmath6 . here we have also introduced the _ reciprocal states _",
    "the reciprocal state @xmath22 is defined as that which lies in @xmath6 and is orthogonal to all @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the set of states @xmath22 is simply the @xmath3-dimensional complex generalisation of the set of ( normalised ) reciprocal vectors in crystallography @xcite with respect to the unit cell basis vectors , these being the @xmath1 .",
    "a complete set of reciprocal states exists if , and only if , the @xmath1 are linearly - independent .",
    "the reciprocal states are also necessarily linearly - independent , as is shown in @xcite .",
    "given that the states @xmath1 have _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath25 , the total probability of correctly identifying the state is @xmath26 it convenient to proceed using the language of positive operator - valued measures ( povms)@xcite . the measurement can be expressed as an @xmath15 element povm operation by defining the positive hermitian operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is also useful to define @xmath29 .",
    "the discrimination probability @xmath30 is constrained by the fact that @xmath31 must be positive .",
    "this , together with the decomposition of the identity , @xmath32 , means that none of the eigenvalues of @xmath33 may exceed unity .",
    "it has been shown that the optimum measurement corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath33 being equal to 1@xcite .",
    "in this section we derive the maximum attainable value of the unambiguous discrimination probability @xmath30 for symmetric states with equal _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "a set of quantum states @xmath1 spanning a hilbert space @xmath6 is symmetric@xcite if there exists a unitary transformation @xmath34 on @xmath6 such that latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    eq . ( 3.3 ) follows from the fact that any state in @xmath6 can be written as a superposition of the @xmath1 , and from @xmath36 .",
    "such states are also said to be _ covariant _ with respect to @xmath34 and have been found to have a preferential status with regard to problems in quantum detection theory . in conventional quantum detection theory , where the aim is to maximise the discrimination probability or mutual information for all possible measurements and not just the subset defined by the no - errors constraint , the maximum discrimination probability for a set of symmetric states with equal _ a priori _ probabilities can be obtained exactly@xcite .",
    "the optimum strategy uses the so - called ` square root'@xcite or ` pretty good'@xcite measurement .",
    "considerable progress has also been made towards maximising the mutual information for these states@xcite , in particular in connection with symmetric quantum channels@xcite .    as has been shown in @xcite , unambiguous discrimination between linearly - independent symmetric states",
    "arises naturally in connection with _ entanglement concentration _ ,",
    "that is , transforming a fraction of an ensemble of systems all prepared in the same imperfectly entangled state into a maximally entangled state , using only local operations and classical communication . the protocol given there , a generalisation of the procrustean technique due to bennett _",
    "et al_@xcite , will maximise the entanglement of a pair of subsystems with probability equal to the probability of discriminating between a certain set of linearly - independent symmetric states .    prior to solving for the maximum unambiguous discrimination probability for equally - probable linearly - independent symmetric states ,",
    "we shall obtain a representation of them which simplifies our analysis .",
    "we use the fact that the operator @xmath34 can be expanded as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the real angles @xmath39 may be taken to lie in half - open interval @xmath40 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an integer satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "it is convenient to arrange the @xmath42 in increasing order , so that @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , we can expand @xmath46 as @xmath47 , for some @xmath48 satisfying @xmath49 . together with eqs .",
    "( 3.1 ) and ( 3.4 ) , this leads to @xmath50 note that the linear independence of the @xmath1 implies that all of the @xmath48 are non - zero .",
    "linear independence means that no superposition of the @xmath1 can vanish , so consider @xmath51 if the @xmath1 are linearly - independent , this must be non - zero for all @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath42 must take every value in this range of integers .",
    "as we have arranged these integers in increasing order , we find that @xmath42 is simply equal to @xmath53 , so that linearly - independent symmetric states necessarily have the form : @xmath54 that having this form is also a sufficient condition for linear independence is proven in @xcite . for these states ,",
    "the corresponding reciprocal states are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "note that the @xmath57 are also symmetric , with respect to the same transformation",
    "@xmath34 as the @xmath1 .    for symmetric states , the operator @xmath33 has the explicit form @xmath58    let us denote by @xmath59 an operator of this form which gives the maximum value of @xmath30 .",
    "we do not assume this operator to be unique , that is , we do not assume the optimum @xmath20 to be unique .",
    "we can however , show that there exists an optimal operator @xmath59 which possesses the symmetry @xmath60 we prove this by contradiction , by first supposing that no @xmath59 satisfies eq .",
    "consider now any operator @xmath33 of the form ( 3.10 ) . if @xmath33 corresponds to the maximum value of @xmath30 , then its maximum eigenvalue , which we denote by @xmath61 , is equal to 1 .",
    "we then define @xmath62 these operators clearly have the same eigenvalues as @xmath33 and give the same value of @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , @xmath63 can be obtained from @xmath33 by cycling the probabilities @xmath20 .",
    "writing explicitly the dependence of these operators on the @xmath20 , we see that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "consider now the operator @xmath66 the second equation here is true if the _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath25 are all equal to @xmath67 , which we take to be the case .",
    "the operator @xmath68 is invariant under the similarity transformation @xmath69 and gives the same transformation probability as @xmath70 .",
    "forming @xmath71 from @xmath33 amounts to replacing all of the @xmath20 by their average value @xmath30 , the quantity we wish to maximise .",
    "however , its maximum eigenvalue @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 this is a consequence of the fact the the maximum eigenvalue is convex on the space of hermitian operators on @xmath6 . a simple proof of this is given in the appendix .",
    "let us define @xmath74 .",
    "the maximum eigenvalue of this operator is 1 , so it is physically admissable .",
    "however , the success probability for this operator is @xmath75 , from ( 3.14 ) . therefore",
    ", we can obtain from any @xmath33 another operator @xmath76 which is invariant under the similarity transformation and whose associated discrimination probability @xmath77 is at least as high as @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the premise that there is no @xmath33 which gives the highest value of @xmath30 and has the specified symmetry is false .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( 3.13 ) , and from the orthogonality of the @xmath78 , that the eigenvalues of @xmath68 are simply @xmath79 . the optimum symmetric operator",
    "@xmath80 is simply that whose maximum eigenvalue is 1 .",
    "the desired least upper bound on @xmath30 is then given by @xmath81 the bound here is clearly less than 1 unless all @xmath82 are equal to @xmath83 , in which case the @xmath1 are orthogonal .",
    "although this inequality gives the analytic maximum discrimination probability , in practice it may be necessary to employ computational techniques to determine the smallest of the @xmath82 , as we will see in the next section . to find the maximum value of @xmath30 for a specific set of states ,",
    "it is useful to have an expression for the @xmath82 which explicitly exhibits their dependence upon the states . using eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) , we find that @xmath84    the simplest set of linearly - independent symmetric states comprises just two states .",
    "the problem of finding the maximum value of @xmath30 for a pair of states has been solved by ivanovic@xcite , dieks@xcite and peres@xcite for equal _ a priori _ probabilities and generalised by jaeger and shimony@xcite to the case of unequal probabilities . denoting the two states by @xmath85 , the ivanovic - peres - dieks limit for the probability of error - free state discrimination is @xmath86",
    "it is interesting to see how this limit arises as a special case of the bound in ( 3.15 ) . up to an irrelevant phase difference , the states @xmath85",
    "may be represented as @xmath87 where the angle @xmath88 lies in the range @xmath89 $ ] and the states @xmath90 constitute an orthogonal basis for the space spanned by @xmath91 .",
    "the system may be represented as a spin-1/2 particle , and @xmath90 taken to be the eigenstates of @xmath92 with eigenvalues @xmath93 .",
    "note that @xmath92 is the unitary operator @xmath34 relating the states we aim to distinguish , since @xmath94 .",
    "we find that the corresponding reciprocal states are @xmath95 the expansion coefficents @xmath96 are given by @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "within the specified range of @xmath88 , @xmath99 , so that the maximum value of @xmath30 is @xmath100 , which is easily seen to be equal to @xmath101 .",
    "in this section , we apply the bound ( 3.15 ) on @xmath30 to the problem of discriminating between symmetric coherent states of the harmonic oscillator or mode of a boson field .",
    "these states are @xmath102 where @xmath5 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 may be any complex number .",
    "the @xmath105 are the usual boson number states .",
    "the magnitudes of the complex arguments @xmath106 are all equal to @xmath107 . however their phases are distributed around the circle at regular intervals of @xmath108 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath109 the projector onto @xmath6 , the subspace spanned by the @xmath4 .",
    "the unitary transformation @xmath34 which maps each state onto its successor is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the boson number operator .",
    "the quantities of interest if we wish to determine the maximum of @xmath30 are the square - moduli of the @xmath112 .",
    "one can show using eq .",
    "( 3.16 ) that @xmath113 unfortunately , this summation seems to resist significant simplification , and in general must be carried out numerically .",
    "a further complication arises if we wish to determine the maximum value of @xmath30 , which entails finding the smallest of the @xmath82 .",
    "this is the fact that for general @xmath3 , none of the @xmath82 remains the smallest for all values of @xmath114 .",
    "this can be seen in figure 1 , which shows the variation of the @xmath82 as functions of @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "the behaviour seen here for @xmath115 is typical of what happens for all @xmath3 except for @xmath116 . in this simplest case , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , so that @xmath119 for all @xmath114 . for general @xmath3 ,",
    "each @xmath82 is less than the others for some range of @xmath114 . at @xmath120 ,",
    "we find that @xmath121 and all of the other @xmath112 are zero .",
    "our numerical results for various values of @xmath3 indicate that , as @xmath114 increases , the smallest of the @xmath82 is successively @xmath122 , then @xmath123 and so on until it is @xmath124 then the cycle repeats itself indefinitely .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the point at which the minimum coefficient changes to a new one occurs when the derivative of the latter is zero .",
    "this can be understood when we observe that the @xmath82 obey the relation @xmath125 it follows that when the derivative of @xmath82 with respect to @xmath114 is zero , we have @xmath126 .",
    "this is the point at which these functions cross and thus the smallest function ceases to be @xmath82 and becomes @xmath127 . as @xmath128 , the @xmath82 tend to @xmath67 . here",
    ", the overlaps between the states becomes indefinitely small , and the maximum discrimination probability approaches 1 .",
    "the maximum discrimination probability for @xmath115 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we see that it is an increasing function of @xmath114 , although its derivative is discontinuous whenever a new @xmath82 becomes the smallest .",
    "we have obtained the least upper bound on the unambiguous discrimination probability for linearly - independent symmetric states with equal _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "the corresponding detection operators @xmath129 are the simplest possible ones .",
    "the only free parameters in these operators for general states are the conditional probabilities @xmath20 . for equally - probable symmetric states ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath30 is obtained when all @xmath20 are equal , and the one remaining free parameter is set by @xmath130 , which is a necessary condition for the maximum value of @xmath30 for any linearly - independent set .",
    "we thus find that for equally - probable symmetric states , the solution for the maximum of @xmath30 is the simplest @xmath3 state solution .",
    "this appears also to be the case for optimisation problems in other areas of quantum detection theory , in particular the determination of the unconstrained maximum discrimination probability@xcite . however , one issue we have not addressed here is whether or not it is only for equiprobable symmetric states that setting all @xmath20 to the same value gives the optimum measurement .",
    "we have also examined the behaviour of the maximum @xmath131 for @xmath3 symmetric coherent states , in particular its dependence on the parameter @xmath114 , which has many interesting features for @xmath132 .",
    "most notably , the derivative of the maximum discrimination probability is not continuous , owing to the fact that no single @xmath82 is smallest for all values of @xmath114 .",
    "while this makes perfect sense from a mathematical point of view , the physical reasons for this pheneomenon are by no means obvious and further work may clarify the matter .",
