    "we have verified that for well ordered naf and caf phases the effect of interlayer coupling is hardly visible up to @xmath152 .",
    "this means that the application of our first order spin wave results to real compounds does not critically depend on a small interlayer coupling @xmath153 as long as the quantum antiferromagnet is in a well - ordered phase .",
    "closer to the phase boundaries @xmath153 has the the effect of stabilizing the ordered phases , especially for j@xmath154 .",
    "in this work we have explored the quantum corrections to the magnetization , the uniform susceptibility and the canting angle in the first- and the second - order spin - wave approximation and by using exact diagonalization of finite clusters .",
    "the deviations from classical behaviour were found to be pronounced close to the strongly frustrated regions where the classical phases meet .",
    "indeed we have shown that linear spin - wave theory breaks down in these regions and second - order corrections do not fundamentally change this observation .",
    "the latter are small well within the af regions and have positive sign for small and negative sign for large fields .",
    "although they prevent the instability of the linear spin - wave theory for small fields they become very anomalous close to the boundaries and one can not expect that the @xmath81 expansion converges in the nonmagnetic region .",
    "this is intuitively clear since the spin wave expansion in the region of the classical boundaries starts from the wrong , _",
    "i.e. _ , magnetically ordered ground state .",
    "a striking feature of these results is that the deviations from classical behaviour in the magnetization curve @xmath47 and the breakdown of the spin - wave expansion are most pronounced on the ferromagnetic side ( @xmath3 ) , as illustrated in figs .  2 and 5 .",
    "one can understand this by considering the asymptotic form of the first - order corrections to the staggered moments @xmath155 and the uniform susceptibility @xmath156 in the caf phase as @xmath157 : @xmath158 here , @xmath159 is the deviation from one of the two strongly frustrated points . for the caf / naf boundary the diverging corrections are the same for the sublattice magnetization and the susceptibililty : @xmath160 . for the caf / fm frustration point",
    "the susceptibililty correction acquires an additional diverging prefactor : @xmath161 , which indicates that a long - range magnetic order is destabilized in a much wider window of @xmath5 for this sign of @xmath0 .",
    "this is in accordance with the ed lanczos results where a tendency to bound state formation of spin waves as indicated by the @xmath162 steps in the magnetisaton of finite clusters is observed@xcite .",
    "this is evidence that around @xmath163 or @xmath164 the ground state will be of the spin nematic type as proposed in ref .  .",
    "it may be viewed as a quantum gapless phase with a goldstone mode describing the collective long range excitations of a nonlocal quadrupolar order parameter .",
    "a second order transition between and the caf phase and this spin nematic _ is _ permitted by the symmetry of the order parameter , and the smooth evolution of ed spectra across the transition suggest that a second order does in fact occur .",
    "the pronounced quantum fluctuations seen in spin wave theory lend further support to this idea .",
    "this can be most clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_at_0.58_hsat ] ( left panel ) where the magnetization is plotted as function of the frustration angle @xmath22 .",
    "the decrease in magnetization from the classical value @xmath165 at around half saturation ( @xmath166 ) characterizes the strength of quantum fluctuations .",
    "their effect increases from zero at fm / naf boundary to a maximum at naf / caf boundary where a discontinuous jump in the magnetization occurs . for @xmath167 ( the caf regime with @xmath168 )",
    "the reduction of @xmath169 due to quantum fluctuations rapidly becomes large and the expansion in @xmath81 breaks down .",
    "this is also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : magn_12 ] .    the exact numerical results ( circles ) obtained from the bonner - fisher plots ( hence the steps ) as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_ed ] also show the strong reduction of the magnetization close to classical caf / fm boundary .",
    "this is a signature of the true spin - nematic quantum ground state which does not break time reversal symmetry .",
    "therefore it has no first order ( linear ) coupling to the magnetic field , resulting in a small magnetization .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_at_0.58_hsat ] shows the comparison of high - field susceptibility at @xmath170 from first order spin wave theory ( full line ) at t=0 with the ed lanczos results at small but finite t , plotted as function ot the frustration angle @xmath22 .",
    "the susceptibility in both cases is normalized to the pure naf case ( @xmath22=0 ) .",
    "the overall agreement of @xmath22 dependence is quite good because due to high fields the effect of quantum fluctuations is suppressed .",
    "again the deviations are strongest close to the classical caf / fm boundary where the saturation field approaches zero and the spin wave approximation breaks down .    the deviations from classical results and the breakdown of spin wave approximation is much less severe on the caf / naf phase boundary at the af side ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the magnetization behaves significantly less singular in this region . as mentioned before a discontinuous jump in @xmath172 at @xmath137 occurs around half saturation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_at_0.58_hsat ] ) .",
    "then the quantum phase transition to the presumably stacked spin dimer ground state may be expected to be a first order transition .",
    "therefore the magnetic and nonmagnetic phases on both sides of the boundary will correspond to stable local minima of the free energy and fluctuations will not be very pronounced leading to a less singular magnetization behaviour .",
    "the first - order nature of transition between caf and a nonmagnetic columnar dimer state was noticed in early numerical work,@xcite while for the boundary with the naf , a first - order scenario was put forward only recently .",
    "@xcite    finally , we comment on experimental data for the high field magnetization of @xmath0@xmath1 compounds .",
    "there are no published data for those systems mentioned in the introduction .",
    "however recently a new compound ( cubr)lanb@xmath15o@xmath173 , with a perovskite / metal halide intergrowth structure was synthesized  @xcite .",
    "this is a spin-1/2 magnetic insulator , and is reported to exhibit quasi-2d magnetic behavior arising from the cubr - square lattice planes .",
    "it shows caf order at a relatively large @xmath174  k.    it has been suggested that the magnetism of ( cubr)lanb@xmath15o@xmath173 can be described by the square lattice @xmath0@xmath1 model with a frustration angle @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) , which puts this compound closer to the strongly frustrated region of the spin nematic phase than any other compound reported sofar .",
    "our spin wave calculations predict a pronounced nonlinear magnetization for this parameter set , particularly at low fields .",
    "however , the experimental results in ref .   show only a modest curvature , at high fields .",
    "we therefore conclude that , while these materials likely do possess competing fm and af interactions , they probably can not be described by a simple square lattice @xmath0@xmath1 model .    in conclusion ,",
    "it is abundantly clear that classically disordered phases of the square lattice @xmath0@xmath1 model need and deserve an analysis which goes beyond the spin wave theory presented here . for further progress to be made in understanding the `` hidden order ''",
    "phases an approximative treatment of the broken order parameter and its low lying excitations is necessary . since both the dimer and nematic phases are bond centered , the bond - operator method might be a useful choice .",
