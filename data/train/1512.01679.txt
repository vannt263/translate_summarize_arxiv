    "pulsars are rotating magnetized neutron stars ( gold 1968 ) . up to now , more than two thousand pulsars have been discovered .",
    "magnetars are a special kind of pulsars .",
    "they may have much higher magnetic field than normal pulsars .",
    "magnetars are assumed to be powered by the decay of their strong magnetic field ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "timing observations of pulsars and magnetars can give us some information about their dipole magnetic field .",
    "once a pulsar s period and period derivative are measured , its characteristic dipole magnetic field is usually calculated by assuming magnetic dipole braking ( tong 2016 ) @xmath2 the rotational evolution of the pulsar in the magnetic dipole braking model is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the neutron star s magnetic dipole moment , @xmath5 is the neutron star s moment of inertia , and @xmath6 is the magnetic inclination angle which is the angle between the rotational axis and the magnetic axis .",
    "the spin - down of pulsars can be described by a power - law ( lyne , pritchard & smith 1993 ) @xmath7 where the @xmath8 and @xmath9 are pulsars spin frequency and its derivative respectively , @xmath10 is the so - called braking index .",
    "observationally , the braking index is defined by the pulsar s frequency second derivative ( lyne et al . 2015 ) @xmath11 besides this gradual trend of spinning down , real pulsars and magnetars also show various kinds of timing irregularities .",
    "these include glitches ( yu et al .",
    "2013 ; dib , kaspi & gavriil 2008 ) and timing noise ( e.g. , frequency second derivatives and subsequent timing residuals , hobbs , lyne & kramer 2010 ; dib & kaspi 2014 ) .",
    "the magnetic dipole braking assumption predicts a braking index @xmath12 ( or equivalently a predicted @xmath13 ) .",
    "however , two groups of observational phenomena challenge this assumption .",
    "firstly , the observations of eight pulsars reveal that all their steady braking indices are less than @xmath14 .",
    "they are psr b1509@xmath1558 ( @xmath16 ; livingstone et al .",
    "2005a ; livingstone & kaspi 2011 ) , psr j1119@xmath156127 ( @xmath17 ; weltevrede , johnston & espinoza 2011 ) , psr j1846@xmath150258 ( @xmath18 , livingstone et al . 2006 ) , psr b0531@xmath1921 ( the crab pulsar , @xmath20 ; lyne , pritchard & smith 1993 ; lyne et al .",

    "secondly , timing observations of more than 300 pulsars found an anomalous distribution of @xmath25 ( hobbs et al .",
    "furthermore , timing observations of 15 magnetars have also found anomalous @xmath25 measurement ( see table 4 and references therein ) .",
    "the above two groups of observations will result in two consequences .",
    "firstly , there may be other effects contribute to pulsar braking .",
    "secondly , these effects may have fluctuations which is unavoidable for a physical system .",
    "one of the potential models which can explain pulsars and magnetars spin - down is the wind braking model ( xu & qiao 2001 ; kou & tong 2015 ) .",
    "the rotational evolution of the crab pulsar has already been studied in the wind braking model by considering the particle density and the effect of pulsar death ( kou & tong 2015 ) . however , there are other seven pulsars with measured braking indices .",
    "they include the high magnetic field pulsars ( psr j1119@xmath156127 , psr j1846@xmath150258 and psr j1734@xmath153333 ) and the low braking index pulsars ( the vela pulsar and psr j1734@xmath153333 ) , which have different timing characteristics from the crab pulsar .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to study the rotational evolution of all these eight pulsars .",
    "the second aspect comes from that for some pulsars their timing variations are correlated with changes in the pulse profile ( lyne et al . 2010 ; keith , shannon & johnston 2013 ; brook et al .",
    "both the variation of timing and pulse profile may be caused by changes in the pulsar s magnetosphere .",
    "the switched spin - down state of intermittent pulsars ( kramer et al . 2006 ; camilo et al .",
    "2012 ; lorimer et al .",
    "2012 ) are also correlated with their magnetospheric activities . for a real magnetosphere",
    ", there will always be some fluctuations . after considering this aspect",
    ", the braking indices of young pulsars and @xmath25 of old pulsars and magnetars can be understood uniformly .",
    "the fluctuations of the magnetosphere can account for the measured @xmath25 of pulsars and magnetars .",
    "the wind braking model and understandings of eight pulsar s braking indices are presented in section 2 .",
    "the fluctuating neutron star magnetosphere and modeling of @xmath25 of pulsars and magnetars are shown in section 3 .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in section 4 and section 5 , respectively .",
    "pulsars are oblique rotators in general .",
    "xu & qiao ( 2001 ) proposed that both the magnetic dipole radiation and particle outflow contribute to the braking torque of pulsars . in this wind braking model ,",
    "the magnetospheric rotational energy loss rate is ( xu & qiao 2001 ; kou & tong 2015 ) @xmath26 the rotational evolution of the pulsar is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a dimensionless function : @xmath29 .",
    "it depends on the magnetic inclination angle @xmath6 , the particle number density @xmath30 ( in units of goldreich - julian density , goldreich & julian 1969 ) , the particle acceleration potential @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the maximum acceleration potential . for the vacuum gap model ( vg(cr ) , ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the magnetic field strength in units of @xmath35 .",
    "expressions of @xmath28 depend on the specific acceleration model ( see table 2 of kou & tong 2015 ) .",
    "the braking index in the pulsar wind braking model is @xmath36 the wind braking model includes the magnetic dipole radiation term ( proportional to @xmath37 ) and the particle wind term ( proportional to @xmath38 ) .",
    "the magnetic dipole radiation will result in a braking index @xmath12 , while the particle wind term corresponds to a braking index of @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , a braking index of @xmath40 of pulsars are expected in the wind braking model ( xu & qiao 2001 ) .",
    "as a pulsar evolves , its braking index will change from about @xmath14 to about @xmath41 which means that the pulsar evolves from magnetic dipole braking dominated case to the wind braking dominated case ( kou & tong 2015 ) . for the long term rotational evolution of pulsars , the effect of pulsar death",
    "should be taken into consideration ( young , manchester & johnson 1999 ; contopoulos & spitkovsky 2006 ) .",
    "the radio emissions will stop when the pulsars rotational period approaches to the death period .",
    "the death period is defined as ( kou & tong 2015 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the maximum acceleration potential drop in the open field line religions . for old pulsars , the effect of pulsar death",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "based on a series of previous works on wind braking of pulsars ( xu & qiao 2001 ; li et al .",
    "2014 ; kou & tong 2015 ; kou , ou & tong 2015 ) , it is applied to all the eight pulsars with braking index measured .      the magnetic field strength , magnetic inclination angle and particle density are assumed to be constant during the calculations .",
    "the vg(cr ) model is taken as an example to calculate the rotational evolution of the eight pulsars .",

    "@xmath6 is the observed ( or assumed ) magnetic inclination angle .",
    "given a pulsar s age , its initial rotational period @xmath48 can be calculated through equation ( [ edotwind ] ) .",
    "however , the pulsars age is poorly known .",
    "therefore , an initial rotational period is assumed for each pulsar and its age in the wind braking model is calculated .",
    "except for psr j1734@xmath153333 , the other seven pulsars initial rotational period are assumed to be @xmath49 . for psr j1734@xmath153333 , considering its low braking index , an initial rotational period of @xmath50 is adopted .",
    "psr b0540@xmath1569 is taken as an example to show the different choice of initial rotational period . when this pulsar was given an initial rotational period of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the corresponding age are 2047 yr , 1736 yr and 1262 yr , respectively .",
    "there are only slight difference for their age .",
    "the observational age information of these eight pulsars are based on their associated supernova remnants ( bocchino et al . 2005 ; park et al . 2010",
    "; kumar et al . 2012 ; ho & anderson 2012 ) .",

    "psr j1846@xmath150258 , psr j1833@xmath151034 and psr j1734@xmath153333 lack inclination angle information , so an inclination angle of @xmath55 is used for these three pulsars .",

    "the magnetic fields of psr j1119@xmath156127 and psr j1846@xmath150258 can reach to more than @xmath57 which are even higher than some of the magnetars . comparing the magnetic field in the wind braking model to the characteristic magnetic field in table [ eightinput ] ,",
    "psr j1119@xmath156127 and psr j1846@xmath150258 have similar values for these two factors .",
    "however , for psr j1734@xmath153333 , the derived magnetic field has obvious gap with the characteristic magnetic field .",
    "it may due to the presence of pulsar wind contribute extra braking torque to the pulsar .",
    "the vela pulsar and psr j1734@xmath153333 have large age in the wind braking model among these eight pulsars , which may be the reason for their low values of braking index .",
    "based on the calculations above and parameters of table [ eightinput ] and table [ eightoutput ] , the long term rotational evolution of these eight pulsars are shown in figure [ allsourcesppdot ] . except for psr j1833@xmath151034 , the vela pulsar and psr j1734@xmath153333 , the other five pulsars will first move to the lower right in the @xmath58-@xmath59 diagram before they arrive the transition point .",
    "the transition point is defined as when the pulsar braking index equals two .",
    "it means that there is a balance between the effect of magnetic dipole radiation and the effect of particle wind .",
    "before they arrive at the transition point , the spin - down of pulsars are dominated by magnetic dipole radiation and the braking indices values are between @xmath60 and @xmath14 .",

    "firstly , the measured braking indices of eight pulsars are less than three . secondly , the abnormal distribution and variety of @xmath25 for @xmath0 pulsars as well as @xmath1 magnetars . unlike the sudden switch of pulsar spin - down rate ( kramer et al .",
    "2006 ; camilo et al . 2012 ; lorimer et al .",
    "2012 ) , timing noise is a continued process .",
    "it indicates that switched states reflect the sudden increasement of particle wind ( li et al .",
    "2014 ; kou et al .",
    "2015 ) while timing noise reflects persistent fluctuations of particle wind , which includes periodic fluctuations ( section 3.2.1 ) or random fluctuations ( section 3.2.2 ) .",
    "therefore , section 2 and section 3 are not separated and they are two aspects of one problem .",
    "the values of @xmath45 and @xmath73 can decide the fluctuations of pulsars , which can be seen in equation ( [ omega2dot_general ] ) .",
    "it shows that , for young pulsars with small characteristic age , it will translate to equation ( [ nwindsteady ] ) .",
    "however , for old pulsars with large characteristic age , it can be written into equation ( [ nu2dot_periodic_case ] ) .",
    "figure [ figppdot ] shows that these two groups of neutron stars have different characteristic age .",
    "the magnetospheric changes of neutron stars will affect both the pulse profile and spin - down torque .",
    "the changes of pulse profile may also contribute to the timing noise .",
    "therefore , magnetospheric changes alone will contribute two factor to the timing noise .",
    "the magnetospheric changes include the variation of total particle number and particle spatial distribution .",
    "a change of total particle number density will result in a significant change of spin - down rate ( li et al .",
    "2014 ; kou et al .",
    "if the total number of particles is the same only the spatial distribution of particles is changed , then the pulse shape may change a lot while flux density and spin - down rate may change only very little ( e.g. , psr j1602@xmath155100 ; brook et al .",
    "as seen in figure [ fignu2dotmodel ] , the fluctuation amplitude of magnetars is larger than that of normal pulsars",
    ". it may be due to magnetars are magnetism - powered while pulsars are rotation - powered .",
    "the @xmath105 in equation ( [ omegadot_final ] ) is a gaussian , markov random process .",
    "markov process may explain serval pulsar timing phenomena , such as intermittency , profile change and switched state ( cordes 2013 ) .",
    "based on the analysis of pulsar timing noise , the fluctuation timescale is chose as @xmath153 ( lyne et al .",
    "2010 ; keith et al .",
    "quasi periodic fluctuations of magnetosphere may result in both observed distribution of frequency second derivative and quasi - periodic timing residual ( liu et al . 2011 ) .",
    "several pulsars may have high variation amplitude @xmath73 , which will lead to a considerable change of @xmath9 ( e.g. , at @xmath62 level ) . if fluctuations are divided into high state and low state , the observed two state of @xmath9 are easily understood .",
    "however , for variation amplitude less than @xmath62 , this change of torque may remain undetected at present .",
    "there are several other models are suggested to explain the braking index or timing noise of pulsars .",
    "a fall - back disk formed from supernova material modulates the spin - down of young pulsars , which would cause the pulsars to loss energy more quickly and a braking index between @xmath60 and @xmath14 ( alpar , ankay & yzagan 2001 ) .",
    "later , the modified fall - back disk model was used to explained the low braking index of psr j1734@xmath153333 ( caliskan et al . 2013 ; liu et al .",
    "2014 ; chen & li 2015 ) and the vela pulsar ( ozsukan et al .",
    "however , this model about pulsar spin - down only try to explain the steady braking indices of pulsars but not including the variable and wide distribution of @xmath25 of pulsars and magnetars .",
    "in addition , whether every supernova explosion can form a fallback is still a question .",
    "an alternative theory about braking index is magnetic field evolution ( chen & li 2006 ; pons , vigano & geppert 2012 ; ho 2015 ) .",
    "some works in this direction also considered the distribution of @xmath25 as well as long term red noise ( zhang & xie 2012 ; xie , zhang & liao 2015 ; yi & zhang 2015 ) .",
    "however , the correlations between pulsar timing and pulse profile point to a magnetospheric origin of pulsar spin - down torque .",
    "a fluctuating neutron star magnetosphere is considered .",
    "the braking indices of eight pulsars and anomalous frequency second derivatives of pulsars and magnetars can be understood uniformly in this scenario .",
    "if the characteristic age is small , then the measured frequency second derivative gives a meaningful braking index .",
    "the analysis is consistent with kou & tong ( 2015 ) .",
    "the rotational evolution of the eight normal pulsars which have meaningful braking indices ( @xmath40 ) are spun - down by both magnetic dipole radiation and particle wind . in the @xmath58-@xmath59 diagram",
    ", these eight pulsars will evolve to the death valley but not to the cluster of magnetars ( figure [ allsourcesppdot ] ) .",
    "it indicates that the effect of pulsar death is important for the long term rotational evolution of pulsars .",
    "if pulsars have braking indices near @xmath14 ( e.g. , psr b1509@xmath1558 and psr j1119@xmath156127 ) , the characteristic magnetic field will have similar values with the derived magnetic field . because in this case , pulsars are dominated by magnetic dipole radiation . for the same reason",
    ", the characteristic age will also have similar values with the derived age .",
    "therefore , for young pulsars their values of characteristic magnetic field and characteristic age still have reference meaning .",
    "the two low braking index pulsars ( the vela pulsar and psr j1734@xmath153333 ) are good examples to constrain different acceleration models in the neutron star magnetosphere ( figure [ velappdotall ] and figure [ j1734ppdot2all ] ) . for psr j1734@xmath153333 , except vg(cr ) , sclf(i ) and og model , other acceleration models are ruled out . also , the effect of pulsar death make important influence at present for psr j1734@xmath153333 .    for old pulsars with large characteristic age , their frequency second derivative are dominated by the magnetospheric fluctuations . in this case , the frequency second derivative is better to identify the spin - down behavior of pulsars instead of the braking index .",
    "it can explain the observations of 222 pulsars in hobbs et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and 15 magnetars ( e.g. , dib & kaspi 2014 ) : ( 1 ) the abnormal and wide distribution of pulsars and magnetars @xmath25 ; the statistically equal values of positive and negative @xmath25 ( equation ( [ periodicnu2dot ] ) ) ; ( 2 ) the @xmath25 can change sign for the same source during different time span of observations ( equation ( [ periodicnu2dot ] ) ) .",
    "magnetars always have larger fluctuation amplitude than normal pulsars .",
    "the magnetospheric variations may have the form of random fluctuation .",
    "the fluctuating component @xmath154 is a gauss , markov process .",
    "this case has similar results with periodic fluctuation , which confirms the calculations of that case .",
    "these two different cases show the same distribution of @xmath25 .",
    "the magnetospheric fluctuation will influence both pulsar timing and radiation , which has already been obtained by the observations ( lyne et al .",
    "it indicates that the pulsar braking torque originates from neutron star magnetosphere and it has fluctuations .",
