    "in the neighbourhood of a second order phase transition the behaviour of various quantities is governed by power laws .",
    "for example the correlation length diverges as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the reduced temperature , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitudes in the high and the low temperature phase , respectively , and @xmath12 is the critical exponent of the correlation length .",
    "@xmath13 is the critical temperature , where the phase transition occurs .-",

    "a universality class is characterised by the dimension of the system , the range of the interaction and the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "critical phenomena can be understood in the framework of the renormalization group ( rg ) . for reviews on critical phenomena and the renormalization group",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the xy universality class in three dimensions with short range interactions is of particular interest , since the @xmath0-transition of @xmath2he shares this universality class .",
    "results for critical exponents and amplitude ratios such as @xmath20 obtained at the @xmath0-transition , are more precise than those from experiments on other systems .",
    "it is an interesting question how the critical behaviour is modified by a confining geometry .",

    "( [ xipower],[cpower ] ) is excluded . as a remnant of such singularities there remains a peak in the neighbourhood of the transition . with increasing linear extension the hight of the peak increases and the temperature of the maximum approaches the critical temperature .",
    "this behaviour is described by the theory of finite size scaling ( fss ) . for reviews",
    "see @xcite .    in the present work we study thin films .",
    "thin films are finite in one direction and infinite in the other two directions . in this case",
    "singular behaviour is still possible .",
    "however the associated phase transition belongs to the two - dimensional universality class .",
    "i.e. in the case of @xmath21 symmetry , a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition @xcite is expected . in our recent work @xcite",
    "we have focused on the study of this transition and the scaling of the transition temperature with the thickness of the film .    here",
    "we investigate the behaviour of the specific heat of thin films in the neighbourhood of the @xmath0-transition .",
    "the specific heat has been studied in a number of experiments on thin films of fluid @xmath2he and @xmath22he-@xmath2he mixtures near the @xmath0-transition . for recent reviews",

    "the authors of @xcite have plotted data for the low temperature phase in an analogous way . up to @xmath48 the data for different thicknesses fall nicely on top of each other .",
    "however for larger values of @xmath49 the data start to scatter .",
    "this is most pronounced at @xmath50 , where the function assumes a minimum .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to compute the finite size scaling function @xmath55 for the first time by using monte carlo simulations of a lattice model .",
    "furthermore we carefully study corrections to scaling , allowing us to quantify the error of our result for the finite size scaling function .    for finite systems we expect that the leading corrections are @xmath63 , irrespective of the type of the boundary conditions @xcite .",

    "on top of the restricted geometry , free boundary conditions introduce new physical effects . for a discussion see e.g. reviews on surface critical phenomena @xcite .",
