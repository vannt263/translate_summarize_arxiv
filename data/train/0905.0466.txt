    "one of the ultimate goals of lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) is to calculate the properties and interactions of light - nuclei to high precision from first principles . while it is important to be able to explicitly demonstrate that nuclei emerge from qcd , the underlying motivation for this effort is to provide proof that lqcd provides a reliable theoretical tool with which to calculate highly complex low - energy strong interaction processes .",
    "with such a tool in hand , calculations of strong interaction systems for which experimental guidance is minimal , or absent , can be performed with confidence and with uncertainties that can be rigorously quantified .",
    "the interaction between three neutrons , which is an important input into many - body calculations of nuclei , provides an example of a quantity that is difficult to access experimentally , but which will be calculable to high precision with lqcd within the next decade .    the theoretical framework with which to determine the hadron - hadron scattering phase - shifts below the inelastic threshold from the volume dependence of the two - hadron energy levels in the lattice - volume",
    "was established a number of years ago by lscher  @xcite .",
    "this framework was used to extract nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths in quenched qcd ( qqcd )  @xcite at unphysically large pion masses .",
    "subsequent fully - dynamical lqcd calculations also used the lscher - method to extract nucleon - nucleon  @xcite , and hyperon - nucleon  @xcite scattering lengths and phase - shifts   ( from a single correlation function ) , albeit at unphysically large pion masses .",
    "the exponentially degrading signal - to - noise ratio encountered in the region of the correlation functions dominated by the ground - state , expected from the arguments presented by lepage  @xcite , severely limited the precision with which the scattering phase - shifts could be extracted from all of these calculations .",
    "the resources required to perform these calculations and the anticipated scaling of the statistical uncertainties in such calculations as a function of the pion mass  @xcite are sufficient to estimate the resources required to perform calculations of baryon - baryon ( bb ) scattering at the physical value of the pion mass to a given level of precision  @xcite . given the smallness of nuclear physics energy - scales , typically a few mev , compared to the chiral - symmetry breaking scale , @xmath5 , or the pion mass , @xmath6 , it is guaranteed that a very large number of measurements will be required to achieve the necessary precision . at the physical pion mass ,",
    "@xcite estimates that @xmath7 measurements will be required to determine the nn scattering length with a @xmath8 uncertainty .",
    "such estimates will be further refined as additional calculations at different pion masses , lattice - volumes and lattice - spacing are performed .",
    "recently , we have performed a high - statistics calculation of a number of single - hadron correlation functions  @xcite on an ensemble of the anisotropic gauge - field configurations generated by the hadron spectrum collaboration  @xcite with a pion mass of @xmath0 , a spatial lattice spacing of @xmath9 , an anisotropy @xmath10 and a lattice volume of @xmath11 .",
    "the goal of the study was to `` jump '' an order of magnitude in the number of measurements performed to estimate correlation functions , and to explore the `` new territory '' that subsequently emerged .",
    "the baryon masses were extracted with precision at the @xmath12-level from the @xmath13 measurements performed on @xmath14 of these gauge - field configurations .",
    "a number of important and surprising observations were made in that work that have modified the path from lqcd to nuclei that we envisage .",
    "one of the most important aspects of that high - statistics work was that a detailed study of the signal - to - noise ratio in the single - baryon correlation functions became possible .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was found to be approximately independent of time for a significant number of time - slices prior to evolving toward the expected exponential degradation  @xcite .",
    "this window of `` clean '' time - slices is understood in terms of the the relative magnitude of the overlap of the single - baryon interpolating operator onto the single - baryon eigenstates , compared with the overlap of the corresponding interpolating - operator onto the lightest eigenstates ( involving both meson and baryon - anti - baryon states ) that contribute to the correlation function that governs the variance of the single - baryon correlation function .",
    "given that the signal - to - noise ratio for a system containing more than one baryon is expected to scale ( approximately ) as the product of the signal - to - noise ratio s of the individual baryons ( neglecting their interactions ) , this window of clean time - slices suggests that it may well be possible to calculate the energy - levels of systems containing a number of baryons in this lattice volume with these interpolating - operators .    in this work we present the first lqcd calculations of system comprised of three baryons .",
    "as the number of contractions required to form the correlation functions is naively @xmath15 , one of the least computationally expensive systems system requires fewer contractions , however the additional strange quark in the @xmath16 system is expected to result in a cleaner signal . ] to explore is the one that couples to a source and sink of the form @xmath1 . for simplicity ,",
    "the product of the single baryon interpolating operators with the quantum numbers of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 are used in the calculations .",
    "this source will have non - zero overlap with states with strangeness four ( @xmath19 ) , spin one - half ( @xmath20 ) , and with a third component of isospin of one - half ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "further , we present preliminary calculations of the @xmath4-system which will contain the triton if it is bound for this pion mass .",
    "we are presently unable to explore even the simplest system containing four baryons because of the computational resources required to perform the contractions ( which are usually the least expensive component of a lattice calculation ! ) , but see no reason why systems containing four and five baryons could not be explored in the near future .",
    "in this study , we employ a single ensemble of the @xmath22-flavor anisotropic clover gauge - field configurations that have been produced by the hadron spectrum collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the technical details of the propagators computed on this ensemble are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and we do not repeat them here . in the current calculation ,",
    "the analysis is restricted to a slightly smaller data set , corresponding to an average on 218 randomly distributed measurements on each of 1191 configurations ( a total of @xmath23260,000 measurements ) .",
    "each of the propagators calculated on the gauge - field configurations is used to determine two - point correlation functions , which for a single baryon have the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an interpolating operator for the appropriate baryon state , _",

    "the dirac matrix @xmath28 is an arbitrary particle - spin - projector and the point @xmath29 is the propagator source point .",
    "the interpolating - operator at the source , @xmath30 , is constructed from gauge - invariantly - smeared quark field operators , while at the sink , the interpolating operator is constructed from either local quark field operators , or from the same smeared quark field operators used at the source , leading to two sets of correlation functions . for brevity",
    ", we refer to the two sets of correlation functions that result from these source and sink operators as _ smeared - point _ ( sp ) and",
    "_ smeared - smeared _ ( ss ) correlation functions , respectively .",

    "the same quark - propagators have been used in each baryon , and thus the source for each baryon is located at the same spatial point .",
    "more physically motivated sources and sinks involving spatial separations would likely improve the overlap onto the ground state in these systems , however this approach would be more computationally demanding and is not used in this exploratory work .    in the present work ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the calculation of correlation functions for which each baryon is projected to zero - momentum at the sink , defining @xmath33 .",
    "further , the optimal analysis of the three - baryon systems ( with propagators from a single source ) would have involved calculating the correlation functions associated with the different sink - smearing , sp and ss , for each baryon . due to lack of computational resources we have restricted ourselves to the ( ss)@xmath34 and the ( sp)@xmath34 correlation functions , and have not calculated the `` mixed '' correlation functions , such as the ( ss)@xmath35(sp ) correlation function .    with two correlation functions associated with each set of quantum numbers in both the one- and three - baryon sectors ,",
    "a linear combination of the pair of correlation functions can be constructed to produce a combined correlation function that more cleanly projects onto the lowest energy state in the lattice volume .",
    "one way to accomplish this is by hand , where one simply `` looks '' for the linear combination of correlation functions that has an effective mass plot ( emp ) with the ground - state extending to the shortest time - slice .",
    "a refinement of this `` brute - force '' method is to use the matrix - prony method presented in our previous paper  @xcite , which we now review .",

    "we have focused only on the state(s ) that couples to the @xmath136 interpolating - operator simply due to limited computational resources . in the past",
    "it has been the case that gauge - field generation has required the majority of lqcd resources , but this is no longer true for precise calculations of baryonic observables .",
    "the resources required to perform the large number of measurements required for nuclear systems is significantly greater than that required for gauge - field generation .",
    "this situation will improve as more effort is put into algorithmic improvements for contractions , in the same way that the use of deflation  @xcite and other techniques have greatly reduced the resources required for propagator generation .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "given the observed behavior of the signal - to - noise ratio , we hope to be able to identify at least the ground state in systems of four and five baryons .",
    "as the central goal for applications of lattice qcd to nuclear physics is the calculation of nuclei and their interactions , we have also presented the first calculations of the correlation function that would contain the triton if the calculations were at the physical pion mass .",
    "the statistics are very limited compared with the @xmath136 correlation function , but it is encouraging to see that there is a clear plateau visible in the effective mass ( within somewhat large uncertainties ) .    the increase by more than one order of magnitude in the number of measurements performed on a given ensemble of gauge - field configurations has given rise to a new understanding of how to pursue nuclear physics processes with lattice qcd .",
    "source and sink optimization involves two considerations ( maximal overlap onto the baryon states and minimum overlap onto the mesonic states in the correlation function dictating the variance of the baryon correlation functions ) to make optimal use of available resources .",
    "it is clear that , at unphysical values of the quark masses , high statistics calculations can be used to explore multi - nucleon systems ( perhaps beyond @xmath137 ) with present day resources .",
