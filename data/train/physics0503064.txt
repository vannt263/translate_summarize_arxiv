    "a snapshot of the out - of - plane current density near the x - line for a simulation with @xmath11 is shown in figure [ jznoguide ] .",
    "the initial current sheet has completely reconnected ; the plasma at the x - line at the time shown was in the low density ( @xmath33 ) lobe at the simulation s beginning . since @xmath51 at the x - line for @xmath50",
    "inward - flowing electrons must at some point find themselves in a region where the magnetic field is too weak to dominate their motion .",

    "zeiler et al . [",
    "2002 ] have previously reported this bifurcation , although it is particularly noticeable in our simulations because of the high spatial resolution ( 16 gridpoints per @xmath55 ) and large ion to electron temperature ratio ( @xmath56 ) .",

    "note that this bifurcation is at a much smaller scale than the ion - scale splits reported in cluster observations [ _ runov et al .",

    "the bifurcation is also evident in figure [ tnoguide ] , which shows the diagonal components of the electron temperature . in analogy with the definition of the fluid pressure tensor we define the electron temperature tensor in a grid cell as a sum over the @xmath57 local particles : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes an average , @xmath60 . like the pressure tensor , which is related to the temperature tensor by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the density , the temperature is symmetric , @xmath63 . for an isotropic plasma",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the temperature tensor vanish while the diagonal elements are equal to each other and to the scalar temperature , @xmath64 .",
    "this is the case at @xmath35 in our simulations .",
    "the decrease in @xmath65 and @xmath66 during inflow are consistent with the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment @xmath67 : @xmath68 decreases , while @xmath69 remains constant .",
    "@xmath70 , approximately the parallel temperature , simultaneously increases due to energy conservation .",
    "any energy change due to the interaction of the reconnection electric field @xmath71 and the curvature and grad-@xmath72 drifts is small everywhere except near the x - line .    once inside the layer the electrons demagnetize and , as previously seen by _",
    "zeiler et al . _ [ 2002 ] , the electron distribution in @xmath73 space separates into two counter - propagating beams due to the cross - current layer bounce motion ( see figure [ tnoguide]d ) . as a consequence @xmath65 sharply increases , as has previously been noted by _ horiuchi and sato _ [ 1997 ] .",
    "despite the beams we see no evidence of a two - stream instability , probably because of the small current layer width .",
    "unstable wavenumbers for the electron - two - stream instability satisfy @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the separation of the beam velocities [ _ krall and trivelpiece _ 1986 ] .",
    "the maximum growth rate , @xmath76 , occurs for @xmath77 , and as @xmath78 the growth rate vanishes . in the simulation",
    "the beam separation is largest at the x - line , @xmath79 , and drops to @xmath1 at the edges of the layer @xmath80 upstream . with a local @xmath81",
    "the instability criterion implies that only wavelengths @xmath82 are unstable at the x - line , and thus that the two - stream instability is not excited in the narrow current layer .    in a 2-d collisionless plasma the reconnection electric field at the x - line is ultimately balanced by the divergence of the electron pressure tensor [ _ vasyliunas _ 1975 ] . in our units",
    "the collisionless electron fluid momentum equation is @xmath83 which is exact insofar as the pressure tensor @xmath84 incorporates all kinetic effects not included in the other terms .",
    "the reconnection electric field is thus @xmath85 where we have dropped the electron subscript and used the fact that @xmath27 . in a steady state",
    "only the pressure terms can balance @xmath71 at the x - line , as can be seen in figure [ eznoguide ] .",
    "far from the current layer the emhd relation @xmath86 holds , while nearer the x - line both the off - diagonal elements of the pressure tensor and the inertial terms are important . at the x - line the pressure tensor terms dominate .",
    "both @xmath87 and @xmath88 contribute , although the former is larger in our simulation by a factor of @xmath89 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath90 is not shown separately but , as expected during quasi - steady reconnection , is negligible .",
    "a large guide field changes the structure of the x - line by both lowering the total plasma @xmath91 and magnetizing the electrons throughout the current sheet . when @xmath3 is small the dominant wave mode at small lengthscales , and hence the governor of the particle dynamics , is the whistler .",
    "this is seen when electrons in the outflow region are accelerated by @xmath71 and drag the magnetic field out of the reconnection plane [ _ mandt et al . _ , 1994 ; _ shay et al . _ ,",
    "1998 ] , causing the well - known quadrupolar symmetry in @xmath92 along the separatrices [ _ sonnerup _ , 1979 ; _ terasawa _ , 1983 ] .",
    "as @xmath3 increases the importance of the kinetic alfvn mode grows [ _ rogers et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ] .",
    "for that mode the coupling occurs when @xmath93 accelerates electrons along newly reconnected field lines , increasing the electron density on one side of the current layer , decreasing it on the other , and forming a quadrupolar pattern [ _ kleva et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ] .",
    "the perturbations in @xmath92 acquire a component determined by pressure balance , leading to a symmetric component that can , for very large @xmath3 , overwhelm the quadrupolar pattern [ _ rogers et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] .",
    "figure [ bzne ] shows the electron density and @xmath92 from the simulation discussed in the previous section ( @xmath50 ) and one that is otherwise identical except that @xmath94 .",
    "the parallel velocity of the electrons , mostly directed out of the reconnection plane , develops a quadrupolar symmetry opposite to that of the density ( high density paired with low velocity and _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "the density asymmetry is a larger effect , however , and the result is an out - of - plane current density that is canted with respect to the initial current sheet , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ jzguide1 ] .",
    "because inflowing electrons remain magnetized in the guide field they do not have figure-8 trajectories at the x - line and the bifurcations in the electron density and current density disappear .",
    "in the @xmath11 simulation discussed in section [ noguide ] the magnetic field on the inflow axis ( @xmath95 ) was dominantly parallel to @xmath24 ( except at the x - line where @xmath96 ) . for @xmath12 ,",
    "in contrast , the field rotates @xmath97 between the lobe plasma and the x - line .",
    "the rotation complicates the interpretation of the temperature tensor of equation ( [ ttensor ] ) , so to simplify we transform to a coordinate system where the axes are parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field . in this frame @xmath98 + \\mathbf{\\bar{\\bar{t}}_{ng}}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath100 is the unit tensor , and @xmath101 contains the non - gyrotropic terms .",
    "images of the parallel and perpendicular temperatures along with cuts through the x - line are shown for @xmath94 in figure [ tguide1]a - c .",
    "conservation of magnetic moment again explains the decrease in @xmath102 along the inflow direction .",
    "since @xmath3 is constant the decrease in @xmath72 is smaller than was the case in section [ noguide ] , and the relative decrease of @xmath102 in figure [ tguide1]c is smaller than in figure [ tnoguide]d . because the electrons remain magnetized at the x - line , @xmath102 remains small , in sharp contrast to the results shown in figure [ tnoguide ] .",
    "the increase in @xmath103 inside the current sheet is due to the intermixing of colder inflowing electrons and electrons accelerated by the parallel electric field along the separatrices",
    ". the unimodal distribution function of figure [ tguide1]d confirms that the electrons do not execute speiser - like orbits .",
    "the terms balancing the reconnection field in equation ( [ ezbalance ] ) are shown for this case in figure [ ezguide1 ] . at the x",
    "- line the off - diagonal elements of the pressure tensor again make the primary contribution although , as a comparison of figures [ ezguide1 ] and [ eznoguide ] makes clear , the scale length over which they are important is much smaller than when @xmath11 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of _ hesse et al . _",
    "[ 2002 ] . unlike the anti - parallel case the @xmath88 term makes the dominant contribution while the @xmath87 term is negligible .",
    "for what @xmath3 does the transition between the reconnection of section [ noguide ] and that of section [ guide1 ] occur ?",
    "far from the x - line , where both species are completely magnetized , the guide field can not play an important dynamical role unless @xmath104 . as a particle approaches the current layer",
    ", however , the reconnecting component decreases and the influence of the guide field rises .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath3 is important when the associated electron larmor radius is equal to the spatial scale associated with the x - line .    consider a system with @xmath11 and examine the z component of the electron equation of motion under quasi - steady conditions , @xmath105 where we have assumed that derivatives with respect to @xmath106 can be neglected when compared to those with respect to @xmath107 . in a 2d steady - state system faraday s law",
    "implies that @xmath71 is relatively uniform ( see figures [ eznoguide ] and [ ezguide1 ] ) .",
    "far from the x - line electrons are frozen to the magnetic field and the @xmath71 and @xmath108 terms are roughly equal . within the current layer",
    "the convective part of the inertial term and the pressure tensor become important , with the transition occurring at some lengthscale @xmath109 where the terms balance .",
    "if , for simplicity , we restrict our attention to the vertical axis through the x - line , symmetry implies that @xmath110 is zero and @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the cyclotron frequency based on the reconnecting field at @xmath113 . in general @xmath114 will be less than the asymptotic reconnecting field . within this inner scale",
    "the electrons carry most of the current , so we also have @xmath115 where we have ignored both the displacement current and the contribution from the current due to @xmath116 . converting derivatives with respect to @xmath107 to division by @xmath109 and combining equations ( [ vzdywx ] ) and ( [ jz ] )",
    "we find that @xmath117 the electron velocity producing the current is @xmath118 .",
    "now consider the addition of a small ambient guide field .",
    "the magnetic field no longer vanishes at the x - line and the electron larmor radius there is @xmath119 where we have taken @xmath120 based on symmetry considerations , @xmath121 is the electron cyclotron frequency based on @xmath3 , and @xmath122 is the electron inflow velocity into the unmagnetized region around the x - line",
    ". the guide field will be important when this larmor radius is smaller than the width of the current layer , @xmath123 .",
    "the major contributors to the electron inflow velocity @xmath122 are the thermal speed and the @xmath124 drift .",
    "a sweet - parker - like scaling suggests that the ratio of the @xmath125 inflow speed to the outflow speed is equal to the normalized reconnection electric field @xmath71 . for a wide range of conditions",
    "it has been shown [ _ shay et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; _ shay et al . _ , 2001 ] that the outflow is roughly equal to the electron alfvn speed @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in the low - temperature limit ( @xmath128 )",
    "this argument implies that @xmath129 and the bound for a dynamically important @xmath3 is given by @xmath130 or @xmath131 in our simulations @xmath71 , and hence the transitional value of @xmath3 , is @xmath132 .    equation ( [ criteria ] ) is not valid when the electron thermal speed @xmath133 dominates the contribution from the @xmath134 drift . in the high - temperature limit",
    "one must substitute @xmath135 rather than @xmath136 for @xmath122 in equation ( [ rhol ] ) , and the relevant criterion becomes @xmath137 where @xmath91 is evaluated with the lobe density and temperature . in the simulations presented here",
    "@xmath138 and so the critical value of the guide field remains @xmath139 .",
    "we note that the estimate for the electron inflow velocity @xmath140 is smaller than the counter - streaming velocity of the electrons shown in fig .",
    "[ tnoguide](d ) .",
    "this is because a local electrostatic field @xmath141 develops inside the electron current layer that accelerates the electrons towards the magnetic null .",
    "however , this field decelerates the electrons once they cross the null so this electric field does not change the effective electron larmor radius of the electrons in the guide field .",
    "we have explored the transition from anti - parallel to finite guide field reconnection through a series of simulations with @xmath50 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 and found , in agreement with our above arguments , that simulations with @xmath13 most clearly display characteristics intermediate between @xmath50 and @xmath146 .",
    "figure [ jzguide02 ] shows the out - of - plane current density for a run identical to those previously discussed except that @xmath13 .",
    "there is no bifurcation in the current density and the canting of the current layer , while present , is not as strong as the case with @xmath147 ( figure [ jzguide1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ bzne02 ] shows the electron density and @xmath92 for this simulation .",
    "the electron density is not bifurcated and bears some resemblance to the quadrupolar cavities so prominent in figure [ bzne]c , while @xmath92 , although still basically quadrupolar , no longer has the strong symmetry obvious of figure [ bzne]b .",

    "the results are clearly intermediate between figures [ tnoguide ] and [ tguide1 ] .",

    ", however , @xmath103 increases to a sharp peak similar to that for @xmath148 .",
    "the perpendicular temperature decreases towards the x - line and then , within the layer , rises to a peak .",
    "this peak is midway in magnitude between the @xmath11 and @xmath148 cases .    in order to examine the variation with guide field of the off - diagonal pressure tensor terms of equation [ ezbalance ]",
    "it is necessary to separate the gyrotropic and non - gyrotropic contributions .",
    "the gyrotropic part is strongly influenced by the presence of a guide field and , in any case , does not contribute to balancing @xmath71 at the x - line .",
    "figure [ offp ] shows the change in the non - gyrotropic portion of @xmath149 as the guide field varies .",
    "the cuts in figure [ offp]d demonstrate that as @xmath3 increases the role of @xmath150 in balancing the reconnection electric field at the x - line decreases dramatically .",
    "the presence of a small guide field also has signatures far from the x - line .",
    "figure [ dist ] shows the @xmath151-@xmath73 distribution functions for three simulations with different guide fields taken at the same point , just upstream of the upper - left separatrix and , for the runs with a finite guide field , inside the density cavity .",
    "because of the low plasma density within the cavity the parallel electric field remains finite over an extended region along the separatrix [ _ pritchett and coroniti _",
    ", 2004 ] ) in the @xmath12 system .",
    "this electric field locally accelerates the electrons , producing a strong beam flowing towards the x - line .",
    "however even for @xmath13 the beam is already clearly present .",
    "( the features in the upper left quadrant of each panel are electrons that have already been accelerated at the x - line ) .",
    "there is a net current but no distinct beam for @xmath50 .",
    "the origin , detailed structure , and effect of this extended region of @xmath93 is discussed in a future publication .",
    "this study suggests that only a minimal guide field , @xmath152 is required to alter the dynamics of electrons both in the vicinity of the x - line and at remote locations along the separatrices .",
    "the implication is that in most real systems , including the magnetotail , the guide field might not be negligible . in any case",
    "this study suggests that one can not simply ignore the guide field if @xmath153 .    a counter - argument",
    "could be made that reconnection with @xmath154 is significantly slower compared to the case with @xmath11 and therefore the magnetosphere will self - select locations where the guide field is nearly zero ( less than @xmath142 of the anti - parallel field ) .",
    "we find that this is not the case .",
    "the guide field alters the dynamics both locally and at large scales significantly before the rate of reconnection is significantly affected .",
    "specifically , figure [ ratecomp ] shows that magnetic flux reconnects only slightly ( @xmath155% ) slower for @xmath12 than for @xmath50 , a result consistent with other simulations [ _ rogers et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ; _ pritchett and coroniti _ , 2004 ] .",
    "it should be noted , however , the the onset of reconnection in real systems could be biased either for or against guide fields .",
    "our simulations do not address this question since they start with a finite perturbation that effectively places the system in the nonlinear regime at @xmath35 .",
    "another factor potentially affecting guide field reconnection is the effect of an ambient pressure gradient and the associated diamagnetic drifts . at the magnetopause , where density gradients perpendicular to the current layer",
    "produce diamagnetic drifts , the reconnection rate can be strongly reduced [ _ swisdak et al .",
    "_ , 2003 ] .",
    "however , it was shown that diamagnetic suppression occurs for small guide fields with the transition occurring when @xmath156 ( for density length scales of order an ion inertial length ) .",
    "combined with the results of this work the conclusion is again that magnetopause reconnection always includes a dynamically important guide field .",
    "guide fields also play an important role in the development of turbulence in three - dimensional reconnection simulations .",
    "simulations by _ drake et al . _",
    "[ 2003 ] with @xmath157 showed that turbulence can self - consistently develop at a reconnection x - line .",
    "the acceleration of electrons by the reconnection electric field led to a separation of the ion and electron drift speeds , which then triggered the buneman instability . at late time",
    "the nonlinear evolution led to the formation of electron holes , localized bipolar regions of electric field .",
    "these structures produced an effective drag between the ions and electrons that was large enough to compete with the off - diagonal pressure tensor in balancing the reconnection electric field .",
    "earlier 3d simulations with @xmath50 by _ zeiler at al . _",
    "[ 2002 ] produced no significant turbulence at the x - line once reconnection was established .",
    "the strong electron heating for @xmath50 ( as shown in figure [ tnoguide ] ) suppressed all streaming instabilities near the x - line since for @xmath158 such instabilities require a beam velocity @xmath159 greater than the electron thermal speed @xmath160 . yet",
    "since @xmath161 is significantly larger than typical magnetospheric values it was unclear from these studies whether turbulence and enhanced ion - electron drag were common features of reconnection in the magnetosphere .",
    "our 2d simulations can not produce the buneman instability at the x - line seen in these earlier simulations .",
    "however , we can examine the distribution functions produced by our simulations and determine whether they would be unstable in a full 3d system . in the low temperature limit with @xmath162 parallel to both @xmath16 and the relative drift velocity @xmath163",
    "a plasma is buneman unstable to wavenumbers satisfying the relation @xmath164 [ _ krall and trivelpiece _ , 1986 ] .",
    "for finite temperature plasmas with maxwellian distributions the condition for instability is more complicated and , in fact , for small drifts in warm plasmas no instability exists .",
    "the instability threshold for arbitrary distributions can be found numerically , but a rough rule of thumb is that a plasma is buneman unstable if the electron and ion velocity distribution functions do not substantially overlap ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "figure [ xdists ] shows the distribution of @xmath166 at the x - line for runs with three values of the guide field , @xmath167 .",
    "the dotted line shows the ion distribution and the double peak is a remnant of the two initial populations , the non - drifting background and the drifting population comprising the initial current sheet .",

    "<S> this implies that great care should be exercised before concluding that magnetospheric reconnection is antiparallel . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that even for such weak guide fields strong inward - flowing electron beams form in the vicinity of the magnetic separatrices and buneman - unstable distribution functions arise at the x - line itself . as in the calculations of _ hesse et al . _ [ 2002 ] and _ yin and winske _ [ 2003 ] , the non - gyrotropic elements of the electron pressure tensor play the dominant role in decoupling the electrons from the magnetic field at the x - line , regardless of the magnitude of the guide field and the associated strong variations in the pressure tensor s spatial structure . despite these changes , and consistent with previous work , the reconnection rate does not vary appreciably with the strength of the guide field as it changes between @xmath1 and a value equal to the asymptotic reversed field . </S>"
