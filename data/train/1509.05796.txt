    "understanding the growth and evolution of galactic disks is a central problem in galaxy formation .",
    "empirical studies in this area employ two complementary approaches to investigate changes in the structure of galactic disks over cosmic time .",
    "one of them , the `` lookback approach '' , is based on extensive samples of galaxies that span redshifts from the time at which disks form ( @xmath8 ) to today ( @xmath9 ) , matching corresponding samples across epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such studies have been successful in establishing the evolution of the galaxy population properties , but they are limited to characterizing individual galaxies by quantities integrated over their stellar populations , e.g. , by their size , shape , or overall velocity dispersion .",
    "the second approach , galactic archaeology , aims at obtaining detailed observations of local galaxies , either through resolving their stellar populations into individual stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or using integral - field spectroscopy , trying to directly reconstruct their individual formation history .",
    "the milky way ( mw ) is perhaps the best case for galactic archaeology , because it has very typical gross properties ( e.g. , mass ) and because we can measure the detailed properties  six - dimensional phase ",
    "space distribution , age , elemental abundances  of large numbers of stars @xcite .",
    "the growth of the mw disk over time is encoded in the orbital distribution of stars and their ages and elemental abundances .",
    "the radial distribution of stars of different ages and abundances constrains in particular the epochs and physical conditions under which different parts of the mw formed stars .",
    "however , the large - scale radial structure of the mw disk has been difficult to determine for any well - defined stellar tracer , primarily due to severe dust extinction in the midplane .",
    "investigations have therefore been limited to measurements of the overall radial profile , which can be characterized as an approximately exponential disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radial population changes in the galactic disk have traditionally been characterized by a metallicity gradient , taking at each radius the mean over the complex abundance distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "neither of these measurements provides a direct empirical constraint on the growth of the mw disk over time , nor have they proven to be very constraining for simulations of the formation of galactic disks .",
    "@xcite suggested a different way to look at the complex correlations between spatial structure and abundances of the galactic disk population , by separately determining disk structure of so - called mono - abundance populations ( maps ) .",
    "these are subsets of stars selected to have very similar abundances , such as @xmath2 $ ]  and and average @xmath1 $ ] ; for each star these abundances constitute life - long tags that remain invariant even if their orbits change grossly after birth . beyond this simple fact ,",
    "a decomposition of the disk in terms of maps is essentially empirical and does not assume or imply a common formation site or epoch ; the detailed relation between maps and the underlying chemical evolution of the mw requires models and measurements of the age distributions within maps .",
    "@xcite were the first to attempt dissecting the radial stellar population structure of the mw disk , by measuring the radial profiles of maps over a few kpc near the sun .",
    "these measurements revealed a complex abundance - dependence of the radial disk structure  both on @xmath2 $ ]  and an average @xmath1$]with older , @xmath1$]-enhanced populations having centrally - concentrated profiles and younger , solar-@xmath1 $ ]  populations having more extended profiles reaching the outer disk .",
    "however , the limited radial coverage and high - latitude survey geometry of the sdss / segue sample @xcite impeded more detailed measurements of the radial surface density profile beyond characterizing the local slope ( in radius ) by an exponential - disk scale length .    the vertical profile of the mw , near the sun and at other radii , is also of great interest for understanding the mw , although its interpretation in terms of stellar disk growth and evolution is still unsettled . in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "the overall vertical stellar density profile ( that is , of all stars ) can be accurately characterized as a sum of two exponential components @xcite , with stars in the thicker of the two components being older , more metal - poor , and @xmath1$]-enhanced with respect to stars in the thinner components @xcite . dissecting the disk into maps",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that this broader picture is the consequence of an underlying disk structure composed of a continuum of disks , with a smooth correlation between abundance , scale height , and velocity dispersion .",
    "while the vertical profile near the sun is composed of a smooth continuum of disk thicknesses , it has become clear from unbiased observations of element abundances of disk stars that their distribution in @xmath10}},{\\ensuremath{[\\alpha\\mathrm{/fe}]}})$ ] is distinctly bimodal , composed of two sequences  high- and low-@xmath1$]that are disjoint at low-@xmath2 $ ]  and that merge near solar @xmath2 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath1 $ ]  sequence becomes more prominent in the inner galaxy , while the low-@xmath1 $ ]  and in particular its metal - poor end dominate in the outer galaxy @xcite , in agreement with the scale lengths measured from the segue data @xcite . but a more detailed and quantitative characterization of the radial behavior of the stellar populations does not yet exist .",
    "exactly how the continuity in local disk thicknesses and the disjoint high- and low-@xmath1 $ ]  sequences in abundances can be reconciled in a consistent formation scenario is currently a mystery .",
    "the complex behavior of the radial scale lengths with abundance found by @xcite , as opposed to the smooth variation of the vertical scale height , indicates that a thorough exploration of the radial profile of maps might hold the key to resolve this tension .    while the mw disk s overall vertical stellar density profile was long thought to be the result of some type of heating , whether from satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or through radial migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the possibility that ( at least some part of ) the stellar disk formed `` upside - down '' with its current thickness has recently gained favor @xcite . the smooth continuum of disk thicknesses found by @xcite disfavors the satellite accretion and few - satellites - heating scenarios , because those would create a discrete thick - disk component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , observational evidence to prefer either radial migration or upside - down formation is scant to date .",
    "radial migration of stars from well inside the mw has been proposed as a mechanism to create the thicker , @xmath1$]-enhanced stellar disk components in the solar neighborhood .",
    "radial migration approximately conserves the vertical action @xcite .",
    "for outwardly migrating stars , the decreased gravitational pull in the outer disk leads to larger vertical excursions that for ensembles of stars should lead to flaring . whether radial migration causes the whole stellar disk or its components to flare depends on which stars participate in the migration process .",
    "if all stars migrate similarly , then all co - eval populations should flare , but if only special subclasses are affected ( e.g. , stars with low vertical excursions ) , then the overall effect of migration on the vertical structure might be small . while the current suite of simulations by no means exhaustively covers the various migration scenarios and histories that may have occurred in the mw , current simulations do indicate that kinematic biases in the population of migrators are significant enough that little or no effect on the vertical structure of the disk should be expected @xcite .",
    "significant radial mixing , therefore , may well happen without leading to flaring while still having a large effect on , e.g. , the present - day abundance distribution .",
    "however , for migration to be the _ cause _ of the thickness of the thicker - disk components in the mw , flaring of sub - populations must occur and determining whether individual maps flare vertically towards larger radii can discriminate among formation mechanisms for the thick - disk components .",
    "that radial migration should and does play a large role in the evolution of the low-@xmath1 $ ]  populations is becoming increasingly clear .",
    "radial migration provides a natural way to explain the observed lack of correlation between age and metallicity in the solar neighborhood @xcite in the presence of a strong correlation between age and @xmath1 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "the change in skew of the metallicity distribution from negative in the inner mw to positive in the outer mw @xcite can arise from migration .",
    "as for the thicker components , if this migration process is important for all low-@xmath1 $ ]  stars ( not just a biased subset ) , it makes the generic prediction of an outward flaring disk .    in this paper we set out to comprehensively determine the stellar population structure of the milky way s stellar disk .",
    "we do so by determining the radial and vertical profile of maps , using sdss - iii / apogee @xcite data .",
    "the apogee data are complementary to the segue data , because they provide much better radial coverage by using near - infrared observations of a large number of giants close to the galactic midplane : the sample of red - clump giants used here spans the radial range @xmath11 .",
    "this radial coverage allows us to determine the radial profile of maps in detail : the data clearly require to go beyond the simple radial - exponential profile assumed by @xcite and all other previous analyses . the wide radial range combined with good vertical coverage ( @xmath12 )",
    "also makes it possible to measure any flaring of maps , providing an essential test of the predictions of radial migration .",
    "finally , the high - resolution spectroscopic observations let us define maps with high - precision @xmath10}},{\\ensuremath{[\\alpha\\mathrm{/fe}]}})$ ] abundances , such that maps have no substantial contamination from neighboring maps .",
    "these better apogee data end up confirming the smooth , continuous distribution in scale height from the thinnest to the thickest disk components , as found by @xcite .",
    "+   +    the outline of this paper is as follows . in @xmath13  [",

    "the majority of apogee targets are selected from the 2mass point - source catalog @xcite , using a dereddened @xmath19 color cut in up to three magnitude bins in @xmath15 ( not corrected for extinction ) , with reddening corrections determined using the rayleigh jeans color excess method ( rjce ; * ? ? ?",

    "this catalog consists of a pure sample of rc stars selected from the apogee catalog using the method described in detail by @xcite , but applied to the dr12 data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "rc stars are identified in the superset of all apogee data using a combination of cuts in the surface - gravity ( @xmath21 ) / effective - temperature ( @xmath22 ) plane and the @xmath23 / metallicity ( @xmath2 $ ] ) plane , chosen such as to select those rc stars for which precise luminosity distances can be determined .",

    "( see @xmath13  [ sec : method ] below ) we correct for the effects of interstellar extinction using the 3d extinction maps of @xcite in the inner - disk plane and @xcite elsewhere ( using @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; the latter is based on pan - starrs and 2mass data and does not cover the entire apogee footprint .",

    "the youngest part of the disk , as well as components more metal - poor than the bulk of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are therefore not represented in the sample ; however , most of the disk mass satisfies these constraints . because the rc consists of evolved giants stars that spend @xmath51 of their lifetime in the rc phase ,",
    "the population of rc stars is a biased tracer of the underlying stellar populations in the milky way .",
    "the extent of this bias is primarily dependent on the metallicity and the ( unknown ) age distribution , but the dominant effect is that the apogee - rc selection overrepresents stars in the @xmath52 to @xmath53 age range with respect to the underlying age distribution .",
    "for example , for a relatively constant star - formation history , the apogee - rc selection is expected to be dominated by stars with ages between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , although older ages are represented at a lower level .",

    "our main use of the second form is to investigate whether any maps show evidence of a secondary component with a different scale height .",

    "each mock - data sample has 20,000 stars .    when fitting the mock data with profiles that include the input density profile , we find that our code recovers the correct profile to within the uncertainties that we find for the real data below . in particular , we confirm that radial profiles consisting of a single exponential are recovered as such , even when fit with more the general broken - exponential profile .",
    "furthermore , we recover that no constant - scale - height mock data set displays any flaring and that the flaring scale length is correctly recovered in the mocks with flaring . for the latter",
    ", we also find that the radial profile is almost perfectly recovered even when they are fit with a constant scale height .",
    "this confirms the expectation that the radial and vertical profiles are measured almost independently of each other due to the many lines of sight at @xmath136 in the apogee footprint ( see figure  [ fig : fields ] ) .    to determine the impact of the uncertainty in the interstellar extinction , especially in the inner mw , we fit the mock data assuming extinction according to @xcite near the mid - plane , rather than the @xcite extinction assumed in generating the mock data ; the latter is typically smaller than the former .",

    "we fit the radial and vertical profiles simultaneously , but focus on discussing the resulting radial profiles @xmath117 in this subsection .",
    "it is clear from table  [ table : results ] and figure  [ fig : low - datacomp ] that a single - exponential radial profile @xmath117 ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : low - datacomp ] ) does not provide a good fit to the data for the low-@xmath1 $ ]  subsamples . a broken exponential of the type as in equation  ( [ eq : brokexp ] ) provides a much better fit .",
    "discrepancies between the observed and predicted distribution of distances in figure  [ fig : low - datacomp ] are small for this model . in addition to the broken - exponential model , we have also performed fits with a gaussian radial profile .",

    "the exact shape of the radial profile can therefore not be determined at high confidence , but it is clear that @xmath117 for the low @xmath1 $ ]  subsamples increases up to a peak radius @xmath121  and declines beyond that .",
    "@xmath117 is highly inconsistent with being a single exponential .    for the high-@xmath1 $ ]  subsample",
    "the single - exponential model provides a good fit , while fits with a broken - exponential or other radial profile all end up as close to a single exponential as possible .",
    "for example , the broken - exponential fit places @xmath121  outside of the observed volume ( @xmath138 ; table  [ table : results ] ) such that this fit is equivalent to a single exponential .",
    "the gaussian radial profile does the same , and adjusts the width parameter such that the profile closely approximates a single exponential .",

    "all of the different extinction maps , however , give very similar best - fit parameters for the basic model for the spatial density .",
    "the radial profile and its uncertainties for the standard model of a broken exponential for the four broad subsamples is displayed in figure  [ fig : broad - radial ] .",
    "it is clear that the uncertainty in this ( parametric ) model is small , and that the peak radius @xmath121  for the low-@xmath1 $ ]  subsamples is larger for decreasing @xmath2 $ ] .",

    "an alternative model is that each subsample consists of the sum of two exponentials ( the model of equation  [ [ eq : twoexp ] ] ) ; this model does not fit as well ( see table  [ table : results ] ) .",

    "that is , we see with high confidence that the high-@xmath1 $ ]  subsample does not display the same kind of flaring as the low-@xmath1 $ ]  subsamples , but @xmath146 is instead constant .",
    "we refine the quantitative constraint in @xmath13  [ sec : maps - vertical ] below .",

    "we have not attempted to refit the segue g - dwarf data using the best - fit flaring model from this paper , but the slow exponential flaring of @xmath172 is such that it is most likely consistent with the segue g - dwarf data .",
    "the measurements of the scale heights in this paper are much more uncertain than those of @xcite , because most of the apogee lines of sight are concentrated near the plane .",

    "we can explain these differences qualitatively as follows : the glimpse star counts at @xmath176 are dominated by the low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps , which in the inner mw are approximately a combination of the `` solar '' and `` high-@xmath2 $ ] '' populations in figure  [ fig : broad - radial ] and therefore have quite flat @xmath117 .",

    "while these qualitative comparisons are interesting , they mostly point toward the necessity to perform proper comparisons between the radial profile obtained from different types of tracers and from different parts of the mw disk .",
    "star counts in the outer disk have found evidence of a break in the stellar surface density ( i.e. , an abrupt steepening of the already decreasing surface density ) , with the majority of studies converging on a break around @xmath187 ( e.g. , @xcite ; r.  benjamin et al . , 2016 , in preparation ) , with a steep density decline beyond the break ( @xmath188 ; @xcite ) . we have found that each map has a peak radius , similar in kind to the break radius found in the outer disk , with outer scale lengths @xmath189 ( see figure  [ fig : maps - radial ] ) .",
    "the break radius seen in star counts using data and methods that do not discern stars by their abundances is therefore most likely nothing more than the outermost of the series of break ( or peak ) radii displayed by the maps ; the series in figure  [ fig : rpeak ] ends around @xmath190 .",
    "more metal - poor maps fill - in the density beyond the peak of more metal - rich maps until the most metal - poor maps are reached , and the total surface - density starts to decline with the steep outer scale length of the most metal - poor low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps . because we simultaneously fit for @xmath117 and the flaring of the disk",
    ", we can be sure that the steep decline in midplane density is truly because of a declining @xmath117 and not just a consequence of the flaring of the disk .",
    "our new results on the stellar population dependent structure of the mw disk provide stringent and qualitatively new constraints on models of the formation and evolution of galactic disks .",
    "we discuss qualitatively the implications of our results for some of the main evolutionary mechanisms , but more detailed comparisons to models are beyond the scope of this paper .    as displayed in figures  [ fig : rpeak ] and [ fig : maps - radial ] , we find that when the mw disk is dissected into maps , it consists of a set of donut - like rings , with a peak radius that is a declining function of @xmath2 $ ]  for low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps .",
    "$ ]  maps have peak radii constrained to be @xmath191 , and are therefore consistent with a more traditional disk structure .",
    "whether or not they actually display at peak at @xmath192 or are really a single exponential over the full radial range is a question that requires more data at @xmath193 .",
    "these present - day patterns in the abundance and spatial structure of the disk must be the consequence of the radius - dependent chemical evolution , convolved with the subsequent orbit evolution .",
    "one possibility is that what we are seeing at low @xmath1 $ ]  are the ( approximate ) equilibrium points of chemical evolution , where a steady state of metal consumption and gas dilution is maintained .",
    "most stars in simple chemical - evolution models form near the equilibrium @xmath2 $ ] , the value of which depends primarily on how much gas is lost to outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ; d.  weinberg , et al . , 2016 , in preparation ) .",
    "outflows are likely more effective in the outer disk than in the inner disk ; this scenario would naturally explain the well - defined radial range spanned by each low-@xmath1 $ ]  map and the anti - correlation between @xmath2 $ ]  and @xmath121 .",
    "the radial migration that the low-@xmath1 $ ]  populations have likely experienced ( see below ) will have smoothed the radial profiles such that the initial radial profile of each low-@xmath1 $ ]  map was even more sharply peaked around a single radius .",
    "how do the high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps with @xmath194 fit into this scenario ? the radial profiles of maps with the same @xmath2 $ ]  but different @xmath1 $ ]  are strikingly different , especially at low @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this suggests that they are not connected by an evolutionary track from high- to low-@xmath1 $ ]  at a given @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the similarity in the radial profile of high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps , combined with the narrow range of @xmath1 $ ]  spanned at each @xmath2 $ ]  along the high-@xmath1 $ ]  sequence @xcite , points towards formation and evolution scenarios of all high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps that were similar enough to be structurally indistinguishable by now . because high-@xmath1 $ ]  populations are likely to be the oldest populations in the disk ( see discussion in @xcite and @xcite ) , this implies that similar physical conditions existed throughout the disk at early times , a conclusion also reached by @xcite , because of the constant locus of the high-@xmath1 $ ]  sequence in the @xmath10}},{\\ensuremath{[\\alpha\\mathrm{/fe}]}})$ ] plane throughout the disk .",
    "what , if anything , caused this to change for the low-@xmath1 $ ]  sequence remains to be sorted out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have also discovered that the thickness of low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps is not constant , but instead flares in an approximately exponential manner ( figures  [ fig : mapfits - flare ] and [ fig : maps - radialflare ] ) .",
    "such flaring is commonly seen in simulations of the outer disk , because of the dynamical heating due to orbiting satellites and mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we measure the same level of flaring for the outer - disk , low-@xmath2 $ ]  maps as we do for the centrally - concentrated , high-@xmath2 $ ]  maps .",
    "it is improbable that the latter have been affected much by outer - disk satellite heating . flaring with an exponential profile and at",
    "the level that we detect is an important prediction of @xmath195-conserving radial migration  that is , any redistribution of angular momentum that approximately conserves the vertical action @xmath195 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , we consider the observed flaring of low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps as another important indication that radial migration significantly affects the distribution of low-@xmath1 $ ]  stars .",
    "this is in addition to the fact that one needs radial migration to explain the observed lack of correlation between age and metallicity for low-@xmath1 $ ]  stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to explain the reversal in the skew of the metallicity distribution function when going from the inner galaxy to the outer galaxy @xcite .",
    "we find at @xmath196 confidence that the high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps do not flare in the same manner as the low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps .",
    "instead , we find that they must have nearly constant thicknesses . at face value , this finding implies that little radial migration has occurred in the high-@xmath1 $ ]  populations , because effects such as those from mergers that can undo the flaring by mixing in - situ and migrated populations @xcite do not apply to the mono - abundance populations considered here .",
    "the fact that large - scale migration does happen for the low-@xmath1 $ ]  populations entails that whatever causes migration likely only strongly affects kinematically - cold populations .",
    "spiral structure whose strength rapidly declines with height is an obvious candidate for such a migration mechanism .",
    "however , determining the exact implications of the constant thickness of high-@xmath1 $ ]  populations for the level at which radial migration affects the thicker , high-@xmath1 $ ]  populations requires chemo - dynamical models that employ a realistic model for the diffusion of stellar orbits due to migration - inducing perturbers . whatever the case may be , the lack of flaring in the high-@xmath1 $ ]  populations makes it unlikely that their thickness is due to migration or satellite heating .",
    "while our measurements of the scale heights of maps are noisier than those of @xcite , they are good enough to confirm the existence and ubiquity of intermediate @xmath126 components and the smoothness of the transition between the traditional `` thin '' and `` thick '' disks : the vertical structure of the disk can not be described by only two structurally distinct components .",
    "overall , the smoothness of the @xmath126 transition , the fact that the high-@xmath1 $ ] , large-@xmath126 maps are centrally concentrated , and the level and homogeneity of the flaring observed in low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps all point toward smooth , internal processes dominating the evolution of the mw disk .",
    "few cosmological simulations exist that can be directly compared to our results .",
    "a dissection of the radial profile of galactic disks into mono - abundance or mono - age - metallicity ( a convenient proxy for maps in simulations ) populations has not been attempted in any simulation .",
    "the analysis of @xcite comes closest of any simulation , because they plot the radial profile of maps in the magic simulations in their figure 1 for a few maps .",
    "however , only a narrow radial range around the solar circle is displayed , and larger - scale trends were not investigated . in agreement with our measurements , they find that high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps are well described by single exponentials in the radial direction . for the low-@xmath1",
    "$ ] , low - metallicity maps they find flat radial profiles , with some of them showing a shallow peak .",
    "however , their low-@xmath1 $ ] , high - metallicity maps do not display the broken - exponential that we find here , but are instead consistent with exponentials .",
    "most other recent simulations , such as those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite only dissect the disk in terms of mono - age populations and find centrally - peaked radial profiles for all such populations . using @xmath1 $ ]  as an age proxy this",
    "does not come as a surprise , as discarding the rich @xmath2 $ ]  structure in , e.g. , figure  [ fig : rpeak ] , will lead to very different radial profiles from those observed for maps here .",
    "the simplified one - dimensional simulations of a thin , axisymmetric , gravitationally - unstable disk by @xcite similar to the turbulent disks found in cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do lead to donut - like mono - age populations by shutting off the gas supply of the inner regions of the disk over time .",
    "the amount of disk flaring for age- or abundance - selected populations in these recent simulations varies , from little to no flaring for undisturbed disks found by @xcite to the strong flaring in the high - resolution simulation studied by @xcite . that the high-@xmath1 $ ]  or old populations have a constant thickness while the low-@xmath1 $ ]  or younger populations flare",
    "significantly has not been seen in any simulation .",
    "if the flaring is due to migration in these simulations , this may indicate that their resolution is not sufficient to distinguish between the response of kinematically cold and warm populations .",
    "the overall thickness of the disk is likely to be constant due to the mix of centrally - concentrated , thick ( high-@xmath1 $ ] ) components and more extended , thinner - but - flaring ( low-@xmath1 $ ] ) components .",
    "this was also recently found in the simulation of @xcite .",
    "we summarize our main results as follows : + @xmath197 the excellent radial coverage of apogee and its apogee - rc subsample has enabled a detailed investigation of the radial structure of abundance - selected components of the disk ( maps ) .",
    "any analysis of the spatial density distribution of galactic low - latitude tracers requires explicit accounting for the 3d dependence of interstellar extinction , even if target selections and observations are in the nir .",
    "we have applied a new likelihood - based formalism @xcite for determining the radial profiles of stellar tracers in the presence of dust extinction .",
    "we have been able to obtain good fits to the observed star counts , even in regions of very high extinction , with simple models for the spatial stellar distribution .",
    "+ @xmath197 the radial profile of high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps is consistent with a single exponential over the large radial range over which they are observed ( @xmath198 ) , with no sign of a steeper fall - off at large @xmath122 .",
    "furthermore , all high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps are consistent with having _ the same _ exponential @xmath117 , with a scale length of @xmath199 .",
    "this agrees with the results of @xcite , who find a common @xmath163 for the high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps and those of @xcite , who find that the high-@xmath1 $ ]  sequence remains in the same place in the @xmath10}},{\\ensuremath{[\\alpha\\mathrm{/fe}]}})$ ] plane throughout the disk .",
    "+ @xmath197 we discovered that the radial surface - density profiles @xmath117 of low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps are complex : they are not a single exponential and are not even monotonically decreasing outward .",
    "each map displays a peak radius @xmath121  with an approximately exponential drop - off away from @xmath121  at smaller and larger radii .",
    "thus , the low-@xmath1 $ ]  stellar disk may be thought of as a sequence of narrow , donut - like annuli of increasing @xmath121  for decreasing @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "+ @xmath197 the peak radius of the low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps depends strongly on metallicity , peaking far inside the solar radius for the metal - rich low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps , and well outside the solar circle for the metal - poor low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps .",
    "this is consistent with the known radial metallicity gradient .",
    "the map with solar abundances peaks at the solar radius , clearly demonstrating that the sun is typical for its galactic location .",
    "+ @xmath197 the thickness of the high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps is constant with @xmath122 and does not display any flaring . the constraint on the inverse flaring scale length of a model with exponential flaring is strong : @xmath154 , when combining constraints from multiple maps .",
    "this argues against the local vertical structure of the thick disk components being set by outward radial migration .",
    "+ @xmath197 low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps present clear evidence of flaring , with an exponential @xmath146 profile and a common flaring scale length of @xmath156 .",
    "this flaring is present both for low-@xmath2 $ ] , outer - disk maps and for high-@xmath2 $ ] , inner - disk maps .",
    "+ @xmath197 we confirm the result of @xcite , who found that all maps have a single vertical scale height , with a continuous distribution of them from the thinnest to the thickest components of the disk .",
    "the high precision abundances from apogee ( @xmath66 } } } \\approx 0.05{\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{dex}}}$ ] and @xmath73 } } } \\approx 0.02{\\ensuremath{\\,\\mathrm{dex}}}$ ] ) renders it unlikely that this smooth increase in @xmath126 is due to contamination between nearby abundance bins .",
    "the measurements of the vertical profile of maps here are somewhat noisy , because of a lack of data at intermediate and high latitudes . to make progress on this front requires high - latitude data with a known selection function .",
    "such data will be provided by the apogee-2 survey @xcite .",
    "we have not attempted to determine updated total stellar surface densities @xmath200 or total disk masses associated with each map here , as was done by @xcite for the segue g - dwarf sample .",
    "doing so for the rc tracers defined using the cuts of @xcite has large uncertainties , because the manner in which giants trace the underlying population depends on the star formation history .",
    "additionally , the severe cuts used to define the rc make the sampling of the underlying stellar population highly non - trivial . we plan to determine total stellar - population masses for the maps in the future by using the full apogee giant sample and the segue g - dwarf sample in combination with the spatial densities measured here .",
    "the current results provide greatly improved constraints on the global abundance ",
    "spatial distribution of stars , which calls for rigorous and global chemical - evolution modeling . as",
    "age constraints for stars beyond the solar neighborhood ( @xmath201 ) become available for extensive samples , generalizing the current analysis to include age in addition to abundances in defining maps will be an obvious step .",

    "<S> the spatial structure of stellar populations with different chemical abundances in the milky way contains a wealth of information on galactic evolution over cosmic time . </S>",
    "<S> we use data on 14,699  red - clump stars from the apogee survey , covering @xmath0 , to determine the structure of mono - abundance populations ( maps)stars in narrow bins in @xmath1 $ ]  and @xmath2$]accounting for the complex effects of the apogee selection function and the spatially - variable dust obscuration . </S>",
    "<S> we determine that all maps with enhanced @xmath1 $ ]  are centrally concentrated and are well - described as exponentials with a scale length of @xmath3 over the whole radial range of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we discover that the surface - density profiles of low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps are complex : they do not monotonically decrease outwards , but rather display a peak radius ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 at low @xmath2 $ ] . the extensive radial coverage of the data allows us to measure radial trends in the thickness of each map . </S>",
    "<S> while high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps have constant scale heights , low-@xmath1 $ ]  maps flare . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm , now with high - precision abundances , previous results that each map contains only a single vertical scale height and that low-@xmath2 $ ] , low-@xmath1 $ ]  and high-@xmath2 $ ] , high-@xmath1 $ ]  maps have intermediate ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) scale heights that smoothly bridge the traditional thin- and thick - disk divide . that the high-@xmath1 $ ] , thick disk components do not flare is strong evidence against their thickness being caused by radial migration . the correspondence between the radial structure and chemical - enrichment age of stellar populations </S>",
    "<S> is clear confirmation of the inside - out growth of galactic disks . </S>",
    "<S> the details of these relations will constrain the variety of physical conditions under which stars form throughout the mw disk . </S>"
