    "strong correlations in coulomb systems lead to a variety of new effects which are absent for neutral particles , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for a review . among those are nonlinear screening effects @xcite , charge inversion @xcite , coulomb criticality @xcite , like - charge attraction for multivalent ions @xcite as well as exotic binary crystalline structures unknown for uncharged systems @xcite .    by using charged colloidal suspensions @xcite or dust particles in plasmas @xcite , it is possible to realize strongly asymmetric mixtures of oppositely charged particles .",
    "these systems consist of mesoscopic highly charged `` macroions '' and microscopic counterions with a low valency resulting in strong charge and size asymmetries . since the charges of the macroions are high , strong coulomb correlations are typical for macroions .",
    "most of the physics can still be encaptured by viewing these systems as strongly asymmetric and strongly coupled electrolytes . in recent years , it was possible to confine macroions in sheets between two parallel plates @xcite and to observe the resulting lateral structure of the particles .",
    "the gross features can be understood in terms of an ( effective ) one - component system with a yukawa pair interaction @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mono- and bilayer ground - state structures which were obtained from a yukawa model @xcite describe the experimentally found structures @xcite . for multilayers beyond the bilayer regime , a rich variety of stable phases are found in experiments @xcite as well as in simulations @xcite , which are all theoretically confirmed for a yukawa system between two neutral walls @xcite .",
    "this motivates a study about the influence of the wall - particle interaction on the phase behaviour of multilayered crystalline sheets in slit - like confinement @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a model for macroions confined between two parallel neutral walls .",
    "there is a direct coulomb interaction between the point - like particles .",
    "the total system is charge - neutral and the counterions are kept at high temperature and are homogeneously spread between the plates resulting in an attraction acting on the macroions towards the middle of the plates .",
    "the system is realized for highly charged colloidal particles or dust particles in plasmas .",
    "some early theoretical and simulational investigations on clusters of artificial atoms @xcite and dusty plasmas @xcite as well as one - component plasmas @xcite , including all the parabolic potentials acting as confinement , reveals the existence of multilayers .",
    "we therefore include the regime beyond bilayers in our discussion . lattice sum minimizations among a broad set of candidate structures are used to determine the structure which minimizes the potential energy per particle . for increasing macroion density , we find a cascade of solid - solid transitions which includes triangular monolayer , buckled bilayer and squared , rhombic and triangular bi- , tri- , tetra- , penta- and hexalayers .",
    "comparing the results to those involving a yukawa interaction @xcite , we show that the topology of the phase diagram depends crucially on the particle - wall interaction .",
    "in fact , some complicated tetralayered structures which were found stable for the confined yukawa model are unstable in the present model .",
    "the strong correlation between phase behaviour and wall - particle interactions suggests to tailor new crystalline structures ( e.g.  with desired filtering properties @xcite ) by a suitable surface treatment of the plates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the model is introduced in section ii . after discussing the structure of different crystalline multilayers , results for the cascade of solid - solid transition",
    "are presented in section iii .",
    "finally we conclude in section iv .",
    "we consider @xmath0 classical point - like particles of charge @xmath1 ( _ macroions _ ) interacting via the unscreened coulomb pair potential @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the interparticle distance and @xmath4 the ( relative ) dielectric constant of surrounding medium .",
    "the system is confined between two parallel hard walls of area @xmath5 and separation @xmath6 , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the global charge neutrality of the system is ensured by counterions .",
    "the latter are taken into account by an homogeneous neutralizing background that is smeared out over the whole slit .",
    "we mention that we neglect the discrete nature of the counterions in this approach , as well as any local ion - counterion coupling .    .",
    "this charge distribution generates a quadratic potential @xmath7 in between as shown .",
    "the separation between outermost layers ( dashed lines ) is denoted by @xmath8 . , width=377 ]    as a consequence of gauss law , the electric field @xmath9 ( stemming from the neutralizing background ) is linear in @xmath10 inside the slit and constant outside the slit .",
    "more specifically , we have @xmath11 we thereby implicitly neglect image charge effects @xcite , meaning that we assume that there is no dielectric contrast at the interfaces ( at @xmath12 ) .",
    "the resulting electrostatic potential @xmath13 , verifying the matching condition at @xmath14 , then reads @xmath15 where the reduced density @xmath16 was introduced .",
    "hence , the potential of interaction @xmath17 between a macroion and the counterion background is merely given by @xmath18 we are now in a position to write the total potential energy per particle @xmath19 as ) , a _ two - dimensional _ neutralizing background is introduced in the lekner ( or equivalently ewald ) sum .",
    "this neutralizing background ( implicitly present in the lekner and/or ewald sum ) has to be distinguished from the one that we use to model the counterions , which is smeared out over the whole _",
    "volume _ of the slit . ]",
    "@xmath20 in its appropriate rescaled form , @xmath19 reads ( within the slit ) @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , showing that at prescribed confinement width @xmath6 the energy of the system depends only on @xmath24 .",
    "consequently the phase diagram at zero temperature is given as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "at each given density @xmath24 , we have performed lattice sum minimizations for a broad set of candidates of crystalline lattices . in order to handle the long ranged coulomb potential ,",

    "hereby we restrict ourselves to layered situations with an up - down inversion symmetry in the averaged occupancy reflecting the up - down symmetry of the confining slit . under this sole restriction",
    ", we consider possible candidates with @xmath38 and @xmath39 up to symmetric six - layer structures with a basis of up to 8 particles .",
    "furthermore , we also examine the stability of several asymmetric buckling phases , as predicted in @xcite . for given @xmath24 , the total potential energy per particle",
    "is minimized with respect to the particle coordinates of the basis and the cell geometry ( @xmath31 and @xmath33 ) .",
