    "strong electron correlations may lead to semiconducting behavior with a narrow charge excitation gap .",
    "this may be realized when a broad conduction band weakly hybridizes with a flat band arising from local atomic orbitals and , involving the kondo exchange interaction between conduction electrons and local electrons , the picture of a `` correlated semiconductor '' or `` kondo insulator '' may be applied.@xcite such hybridization gap formation is reported for a small group of rare - earth containing intermetallic compounds where the kondo - like interaction between conduction electrons and the well localized @xmath2-electrons leads to a insulating ground state .",
    "this process essentially accounts for the unconventional temperature dependencies for the gap formation which is reflected in a number of temperature dependent , narrow gap semiconductor properties.@xcite in contrast , a common semiconductor picture characterizes the gap with a simple thermal charge carrier activation across rigid bands .",
    "infrared optical spectroscopy can provide important information about the gap formation process . in case of a kondo insulator",

    "this behavior is not expected for gaps between rigid bands and has been reported , for example , for the prototype kondo insulator ce@xmath3bi@xmath4pt@xmath3.@xcite additionally , on cooling , the optical spectral weight is shifted from below the gap to energies an order of magnitude larger , pointing to strong electronic correlations involved in the charge gap formation.@xcite recent calculations within the periodic anderson model show that the optical behavior of kondo insulators is governed by an _ indirect _ energy gap in the mid - infrared region which is associated with the gap in the density of states ( dos ) and a _ direct _ gap at higher energies that controls the anomalous redistribution of spectral weight.@xcite    the narrow band gap semiconductor fesb@xmath0 ( orthorhombic marcasite - type structure @xcite ) was discussed as a possible non - rare - earth containing correlated semiconductor,@xcite besides the extensively discussed fesi.@xcite similar to fesi , a correlated semiconductor scenario for fesb@xmath0 would be favored by the fact that it gets semiconducting and diamagnetic in the same temperature region . also , the charge excitation spectra of either these compounds display features of a hybridization gap and strong electron correlations.@xcite however , in the case of fesi , it still seems not settled whether strong electron correlations could be inferred from an anomalous spectral weight redistribution in the optical conductivity .",

    "the spectral weight is not only redistributed toward energies higher than 1  ev but also piles up as a continuum of excitations in the far - infrared spectral region .",
    "therefore , from these optical measurements the application of a correlated semiconductor description for fesb@xmath0 remained an open issue , and the presence of in - gap localized states in connection with lattice dynamical effects were suggested to explain the unusual spectral weight redistribution .",
