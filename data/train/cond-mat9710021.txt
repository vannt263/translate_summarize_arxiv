    "although several interpretations of the glass transition exist ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the only microscopic approach leading to a variety of predictions is based upon the mode coupling theory ( mct ) .",
    "this theory , which was proposed first by bengtzelius , gtze and sjlander @xcite and leutheusser @xcite , provides an equation of motion for the normalized density correlator @xmath15 of a simple liquid .",
    "note that @xmath16 depends on @xmath17 only , due to the isotropy of the system . in its idealized version ,",
    "mct predicts the existence of a dynamical transition at a critical temperature @xmath0 ( or a critical density @xmath18 ) from an ergodic to a nonergodic phase , corresponding to a liquid and a glass , respectively .",
    "the nonergodicity parameter ( nep ) @xmath19 serves as an order parameter for that transition .",
    "@xmath20 may change either continuously ( type - a transition ) or discontinuously ( type - b transition ) at @xmath0 . for the structural glass transition",
    "only the latter is relevant .",
    "the test of the predictions of the ideal mct has challenged both , experimental work and computer simulations .",
    "most of the experiments have determined the intermediate scattering function @xmath21 or its time - fourier transform , the dynamical structure factor ( coherent and incoherent part ) .",
    "this yields information on the dynamics of the translational degrees of freedom ( tdof ) , only .",
    "a great part of these investigations was reviewed by gtze and sjgren @xcite and in refs .",
    "@xcite .    since most of the glass formers are molecular systems , it is also important to study the role of the orientational degrees of freedom ( odof ) and their coupling to the tdof .",
    "a convenient way for this is , e.g. , the use of dielectric spectroscopy .",
    "recent results from dielectric measurements @xcite are partly consistent with the predictions of mct for simple liquids .",
    "the interpretation of light scattering experiments is not so obvious . since tdof and odof",
    "may both contribute to light scattering , it is not so easy to separate the orientational part .",
    "( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . concerning computer simulations ,",
    "only a few molecular liquids have been studied so far @xcite . in a recent molecular dynamics [ md]-simulation",
    "@xcite the present authors investigated a liquid of diatomic , rigid molecules with lennard - jones interactions .",
    "apart from linear molecules with head - tail symmetry , this is the simplest choice for a molecular system . because dielectric and light scattering measurements yield essentially only information for @xmath22 , we restricted ourselves to orientational correlators with @xmath23 and to the translational and rotational diffusion constant @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the main result we have found is the existence of a power law dependence of all the orientational relaxation times @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and of @xmath24 on temperature with a single critical temperature @xmath29 , in agreement with ideal mct .",
    "slightly above @xmath0 the numerical results for @xmath30 , @xmath27 and @xmath24 deviate from a power law , due to ergodicity restoring processes .",
    "these processes , which are not considered by the ideal mct , can be accounted for by its extended version @xcite .",
    "the observation that the temperature dependence of @xmath25 does not fit into this scheme , but bifurcates from @xmath24 at a temperature significantly above @xmath0 and then obeys an arrhenius law , rather than a power law , has been a further important result .",
    "the main purpose of the present and the following paper @xcite is the extension of our recent results @xcite to finite @xmath5 and to perform a thorough test of the predictions of the ideal mct .",
    "the present paper is restricted to the tdof only , whereas the following paper @xcite considers orientational correlators , which explicitly contain the coupling between odof and tdof .",
    "although our simulation investigates a molecular system , we make a comparison with the predictions of mct for _ simple _ liquids .",
    "the ideal mct for simple liquids has been recently extended to a dumbbell molecule in a simple liquid @xcite and to molecular liquids of linear @xcite and arbitrary shaped molecules @xcite .",
    "so far , the investigations of these molecular mct - equations were restricted to the calculation of the nep @xcite . for linear molecules without head - tail symmetry , it follows from these equations @xcite that the tdof and odof freeze at a single critical temperature @xmath0 , consistent with our recent results for @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the time dependent molecular mct - equations , which would allow comparison with our md - results , will be done in future .",

    "ideal mct predicts the existence of a dynamical transition at @xmath0 from an ergodic to a nonergodic phase which is an ideal glass transition . for temperatures close to @xmath0 ,",
    "mct predicts the existence of two scaling laws for @xmath21 with time scales @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the @xmath6-relaxation time . in the first scaling regime ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath34 , the density correlator takes the form : @xmath35 with @xmath36 the nep at @xmath0 and @xmath37 the critical amplitude .",
    "@xmath38 is a microscopic time of the order of @xmath39 sec .",
    "the so - called @xmath1-correlator ( or critical correlator ) @xmath40 obeys the first scaling law : @xmath41 with the correlation scale @xmath42 and the separation parameter @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45-independent master functions @xmath46 are solutions of a certain scaling equation .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1-relaxation time scale @xmath47 is given by :    @xmath48    for @xmath40 one obtains the following asymptotic power laws : @xmath49 the critical law , upper equation of ( 6 ) , holds above and below @xmath0 , whereas the von schweidler law , lower equation of ( 6 ) , is valid only above the transition point . below @xmath0 , @xmath50 decays to a constant for @xmath51 .",
    "both exponents @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related to the exponent parameter @xmath54 by : @xmath55 with @xmath56 the gamma function . from ( 7 ) one gets that @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is determined by the static correlators at @xmath0 .",
    "the result ( 3 ) which states that in the first scaling regime the @xmath5- and @xmath60-dependence factorizes is one of the most important predictions of the ideal mct . due to this factorization ,",
    "( 3 ) can easily be transformed to real space : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the fourier transform of @xmath21 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "it is important to realize that the result ( 6 ) only holds asymptotically for @xmath65 .",
    "the next order correction to both of these asymptotic laws was recently derived and calculated for a system of hard spheres by franosch _",
    "corrections to the von schweidler law @xcite @xmath66 have already been studied for hard spheres by fuchs _",
    "there it was demonstrated that these corrections may be important .",
    "the expansion ( 9 ) is valid for @xmath67 , where the @xmath6-relaxation time scale @xmath33 is given by @xmath68 with @xmath69 the translational diffusion constant @xmath24 is predicted to scale like @xmath70 . therefore it is : @xmath71 corrections to the critical law lead to @xcite : @xmath72 in the second scaling regime , i.e. for @xmath60 of the order of @xmath33 , a master function @xmath73 exists such that @xmath74 in glass science the result ( 14 ) is called time - temperature superposition principle . the expansion of the r.h.s . of ( 14 ) with respect to @xmath75 yields ( 9 ) .",
    "equation ( 14 ) represents the second scaling law .",
    "finally we mention that all these mct - results hold for the self part of the density correlator as well .",
    "the model we investigate is a one - component system of rigid diatomic molecules .",
    "each molecule is composed of two different lennard - jones particles , in the following denoted by @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which are separated by a distance @xmath78 and each of which has the same mass @xmath79 .",
    "the interaction between two molecules is given by the sum of the interaction between the four particles which is given by the lennard - jones potential @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the lennard - jones parameters are given by : @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in the following",
    "we will use reduced units and use @xmath86 as the unit of length , @xmath87 as the unit of energy ( setting @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 as the unit of time .",
    "if the atoms are argon - like this time unit corresponds to approximately 0.3 ps .    in order to make the simulation more realistic we did it at constant external pressure @xmath90=1.0 .",
    "the length of the equilibration runs always exceeded the typical relaxation time of the system at the temperature considered , which allows us to conclude that in the subsequent production runs we were investigating the _ equilibrium _ dynamics of the system .",
    "the temperatures we investigated are @xmath91 , 3.0 , 2.0 , 1.4 , 1.1 , 0.85 , 0.70 , 0.632 , 0.588 , 0.549 , 0.520 , 0.500 , 0.489 and 0.477 .",
    "the total number of molecules was 500 and , in order to improve the statistics of the results , we averaged at each temperature over at least eight independent runs . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for a clearer presentation of our results , this section is divided into two subsections , where the first is devoted to the static and the second to the dynamical properties .",
    "the latter is divided into two parts again , which are real space and @xmath5-space representation .",
    "first of all we remark that thermodynamic quantities like , e.g. the average density and the enthalpy do not exhibit any signature of a singular behavior for the full temperature range @xmath92 , we have investigated . from this",
    "we conclude that the observed slowing down is probably not related to an approach of the system to a critical point of a second order phase transition .",
    "the structural properties are one of the most interesting static features of a supercooled liquid .",
    "figure 1 shows the static structure factor @xmath3 of the center of mass positions for different temperatures as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "its @xmath5-dependence has the typical behavior expected for a liquid , with a main peak at @xmath93 and a first minimum at @xmath94 for the lowest temperature .",
    "with increasing temperature the peak positions shift to smaller @xmath5 values , due to an increase of the average distance between the molecular centers , and the peaks become broader .    a comparison of @xmath3 for @xmath95 with the partial structure factors @xmath96 , where @xmath97 refers to atom @xmath76 and atom @xmath77 , is given in fig .  2 .",
    "whereas the main peak in @xmath3 and @xmath96 is essentially at the same position , the remaining @xmath5-dependence is quite different for the various correlators . for the pre - peak of @xmath98 and @xmath99 at @xmath100 , which could indicate a `` medium '' range order , we have not found a conclusive interpretation . concerning the microscopic structural properties it is more convenient to consider the atomic radial pair distribution functions @xmath101 and the corresponding function @xmath102 for the center of mass positions , which are shown in figs .  3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "there is no significant difference between the @xmath101 probably due to the fact that the choice of our model parameters @xcite does not introduce a strong asymmetry between particles of type @xmath76 and particles of type @xmath77 .",
    "besides a first and a splitted second nearest neighbor peak at about @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 , respectively ( fig .",
    "3 ) , an intermediate peak occurs at @xmath106 .",
    "the peak at @xmath107 is also found for @xmath108 , but its main peak is at @xmath109 ( cf .",
    "the peaks in @xmath110 at @xmath111 and @xmath112 are missing for @xmath108 .",
    "the splitted _ first _",
    "nearest neighbor peak of @xmath108 can be attributed to cross- and t - configurations , as also found for other molecular liquids ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we do not dwell more on these results , since our main concern are the dynamical features in the strongly supercooled regime .",
    "the main reason we have presented @xmath3 is to compare its @xmath5-dependence with the static correlation functions of the orientational correlators presented in part ii .",
    "we already anticipate that this @xmath5-dependence can be rather different for the various correlators .",
    "to start we discuss the self motion of a molecule .",
    "one of the important transport coefficient is the translational diffusion constant @xmath24 which is obtained from the mean squared displacement by : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the number of molecules .",
    "the temperature - dependence of @xmath24 is presented in fig .  5 on a double - logarithmic scale .",
    "the diffusion constant follows a power law , as predicted by ideal mct [ cf .",
    "( 12 ) ] , over a surprisingly large range of four decades in @xmath24 . as critical temperature",
    "we obtain @xmath29 and for the corresponding exponent @xmath115 . with use of eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 11 ) , this yields the von schweidler exponent @xmath116 , the critical exponent @xmath117 and the exponent parameter @xmath118 . at the two lowest temperatures the deviations of the numerical values for @xmath24 from the power law , which has been mentioned in the introduction , can clearly be seen .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "5 depicts the time dependence of the mean squared displacement for all temperatures , from which @xmath119 was deduced .",
    "more information on the self motion is contained in the self part of the van hove correlator : @xmath120 the @xmath121-dependence of @xmath122 is shown in fig .",
    "6 for times which are equidistant on a logarithmic time axis and for the lowest temperature . with time , the @xmath123-peak at @xmath124 broadens and for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , i.e. in the hydrodynamic limit , it approaches a gaussian distribution : @xmath127 in the time span @xmath128 , where the mean squared displacement for the lowest temperature exhibits a plateau ( cf .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "5 ) , the @xmath121-dependence of @xmath122 varies only weakly with time , which indicates the validity of the factorization [ eq .  ( 8) ] . to check this ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "7 @xmath129 as a function of @xmath121 for fixed @xmath130 and @xmath131 and various @xmath60-values .",
    "( 8) is valid , this ratio must be independent of @xmath60 and @xmath131 .",
    "for the times @xmath60 and @xmath131 we have chosen in fig .  7 , this is indeed reasonably fulfilled . that this is not true for the full time span ,",
    "can be inferred from the inset of fig .",
    "another interesting conclusion can be drawn from the @xmath121-dependence of @xmath132 for the largest time . as can be seen from fig .",
    "6 , at no time there is any indication for the presence of a secondary peak at @xmath133 , the nearest neighbor distance . from the absence of such a peak it is usually concluded , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , that no hopping processes are present .",
    "but for the present system we have strong evidence , see fig .  5 , that at the lowest temperature hopping processes are indeed present .",
    "thus we conclude that hopping processes do not necessarily lead to a secondary peak in @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath121-dependence of @xmath132 is not gaussian for a large time regime .",
    "the deviation from a gaussian can be quantified by the non - gaussian parameters @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "8 shows @xmath135 in case of a gaussian process @xmath136 vanishes . for @xmath137 and",
    "@xmath125 @xmath136 goes to zero .",
    "but in between there exists a time regime for all temperatures where @xmath138 is substantially different from zero .",
    "the increasing part of @xmath138 seems to fall onto a master curve , as already found earlier @xcite .",
    "the time @xmath139 , where @xmath136 obtains its maximum , obeys a power law @xmath140 ( see inset of fig .",
    "8) with @xmath141 which coincides with @xmath142 , derived from @xmath119 , in agreement with the results of sciortino _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "this suggests that @xmath136 for @xmath143 is determined by the @xmath6-relaxation as it follows from ideal mct .",
    "exactly the same conclusions also hold for @xmath144 .",
    "the collective dynamics can be studied by use of the distinct part of the van hove correlator @xmath145 which is shown in fig .  9 for various times and again for the lowest temperature .",
    "its @xmath121- and @xmath60-dependence is quite similar to that found for a binary liquid @xcite . the test of the factorization [ eq .  ( 8) ]",
    "can be done as for the self part .",
    "the corresponding ratio is presented in fig .",
    "10 for the same time regime as in fig .",
    "a reasonable collapse onto one master curve occurs , in agreement with ideal mct .",
    "although the visualization of local structural properties favors the use of a real space representation of the correlators , most experimental results are obtained in @xmath5-space .",
    "in addition the translational invariance of the interactions also suggests a theoretical description by use of @xmath5-dependent correlators .",
    "for instance the memory part of the mct - equation for the density correlator @xmath21 is `` diagonal '' in @xmath5-space but involves a convolution in real space .",
    "let us start with the self part @xmath146 of the collective density correlator @xmath21 [ cf .",
    "( 1 ) ] , which is presented in fig .  11 for @xmath147 , the position of the main peak in @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 ) .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath5 is measured in units of @xmath86 , the position of the lennard - jones minimum for the @xmath76-particles .",
    "the small bump in @xmath146 at @xmath148 , which is also present in @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "14 and 15 ) , is due to a sound wave and @xmath149 is the time for the sound wave to traverse the box size of our sample .",
    "this effect was also observed by lewis _",
    "_ @xcite and has recently been shown to be much more pronounced in strong glass formers  @xcite .",
    "for the highest temperature , @xmath91 , the decay of @xmath146 is essentially exponential .",
    "with decreasing temperature the relaxation crosses over into a two - step process , as predicted by mct .",
    "for the lowest temperature , @xmath150 , a `` quasi - plateau '' can be seen .",
    "its height is a measure of the critical nep @xmath151 .",
    "the reader should note that @xmath152 decays to zero for large times , indicating that the length of the runs is large enough to equilibrate the system . in order to test mct ,",
    "we have determined the @xmath6-relaxation times @xmath153 from the condition @xmath154 .",
    "its temperature dependence is shown in fig .",
    "12 ( squares ) for @xmath147 and @xmath155 .",
    "using @xmath0 = 0.475 , as determined from @xmath119 , both relaxation times follow a power law over about three decades .",
    "the corresponding @xmath10-values are practically the same @xmath156 , but differ significantly from @xmath157 .",
    "such a discrepancy between @xmath142 and @xmath158 has been observed already before  @xcite and indicates that the mct prediction , that the two exponents should be equal , is not valid for these systems .",
    "@xmath156 yields the von schweidler exponent @xmath159 and the exponent parameter @xmath160 .",
    "we also note that a power law fit with @xmath0 as a free parameter yields a value for @xmath0 which coincides with @xmath29 to within @xmath161 .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath153 can now be used to rescale time in order to test the time - temperature superposition principle [ eq .",
    "( 14 ) ] , which is done in fig .",
    "we find that the relaxation curves fall indeed onto one master curve for the lowest temperatures . the late stage relaxation can be fitted well by a kohlrausch - williams - watts - law ( kww ) , i.e. @xmath162 $ ] , dashed curve . for higher temperatures ( cf .",
    "e.g. the curve for @xmath163 ) no such scaling exists .",
    "we also note that such a scaling was not possible for certain types of _ orientational _ correlation functions  @xcite , which shows that this prediction of mct is not a trivial one .",
    "having demonstrated the validity of the second scaling law [ eq .",
    "( 14 ) ] , we can test whether the von schweidler law , including the next order correction [ eq .",
    "( 9 ) ] fits the master curve well in the late @xmath1-relaxation regime . as can be seen from fig .",
    "11b this type of fit works very well ( dotted line ) . in practice , this has been done for @xmath146 at the lowest temperature by using @xmath159 ( deduced from @xmath158 ) .",
    "the wave vector dependence of @xmath151 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 is shown in fig .  13 . here",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "the fit of the data with the von schweidler law including the next order correction yields @xmath166 and @xmath167 [ cf .",
    "since the @xmath5-independent @xmath6-relaxation time scale @xmath168 can only be determined up to a @xmath169-independent factor , the same is true for @xmath170 and @xmath171 . in fig .",
    "13 we therefore show @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the @xmath5-variation of these quantities is quite similar to that for hard spheres @xcite .",
    "particularly we also find a zero of @xmath165 at a finite q - value @xmath174 with @xmath175 for @xmath176 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath5 for the hard sphere system is given in units of the diameter @xmath177 , we can deduce @xmath178 from ref .",
    "that this is about three times larger than our value , is partly due to a larger effective diameter @xmath179 of our molecules , compared to @xmath177 .",
    "we now turn to the collective dynamics as obtained from the density correlator @xmath21 , which is presented , respectively , for @xmath2 and @xmath4 in figs .",
    "14a and 14b .",
    "the time - dependence looks similar to that of @xmath146 , but the height of the `` quasi - plateau '' is much lower and the stretching of the relaxation is more pronounced for the case of @xmath4 . the @xmath6-relaxation time @xmath180 has been determined from the condition @xmath181 , since using the @xmath182 definition of @xmath33 would lead to an underestimation of the @xmath6relaxation time for @xmath4 , since the plateau is so low .",
    "( we note that choosing @xmath182 instead of @xmath183 , for the case where both definitions can be used , or even using a kww - fit to deduce @xmath180 , leads to essentially the same temperature - dependence ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath8 is shown in fig .",
    "12 . taking",
    "again @xmath0 = 0.475 as given , @xmath180 obeys a power law , with @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "it is remarkable that the range for the power law for @xmath4 is almost one decade less than for @xmath2 , which shows that different correlators reach the asymptotic regime at different temperatures .",
    "15 shows that also for these correlation functions the second scaling law holds and that it holds better for @xmath186 than for @xmath187 .",
    "the late stage relaxation can again be fitted well by a kww - law ( dashed line ) . since the curves for the different temperatures fall onto a master curve , it is sufficient to focus on the curve for the lowest temperature in order to test whether the first scaling law holds .",
    "the results of our analysis are shown in fig .",
    "16 and 17 for @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "let us discuss @xmath2 first .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "16 , the von schweidler law , with @xmath188 , the same value we used to fit the von schweidler law to @xmath146 , fits the data over about 2.5 decades in time ( long dashed line ) .",
    "taking into account the next order correction ( cf .",
    "9 ) leads to a significant improvement of the fit for @xmath189 ( solid line ) .",
    "we have also fitted the numerical data with the @xmath1-correlator with ( dotted line ) and without ( short dashed line ) correction .",
    "this was done by solving the equation for @xmath190 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and making use of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . here",
    "we encounter the same problem as we did for the fit with the von schweidler law , because the @xmath1-relaxation time @xmath31 can only be determined up to a @xmath169-independent factor . in order to proceed",
    "we have chosen for @xmath31 the position of the inflection point of @xmath191 , indicated in fig .",
    "16 by a filled circle .",
    "the optimum values @xmath160 and @xmath192 stemming from that fit were used for the similar fit of all the other correlators of the present paper and of ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the orientational correlators with @xmath28 @xcite . from the figure we recognize that in the late @xmath1-relaxation regime these fits are identical to the ones of the von schweidler law , as it should be . in the early @xmath1-relaxation regime",
    ", however , the @xmath1-correlator fits the data much better than the von schweidler law , since part of the approach to the plateau is fitted well also .",
    "nevertheless , the critical law is not really observed , even if one includes the corrections to it [ cf .",
    "( 13 ) ] .    for @xmath4",
    "it is not possible to obtain a good fit with the von schweidler law alone , if @xmath53 is kept fixed at 0.55 .",
    "if @xmath53 is used as a free parameter , a satisfactory fit is obtained but at the cost of a @xmath5-dependent von schweidler exponent @xmath193 , in contradiction to mct .",
    "since the critical nep obtained from this fit were rather structureless and did not qualitatively agree with the nep obtained from solving the molecular mct - equations @xcite , we decided to keep @xmath53 = 0.55 ( obtained from @xmath158 ) fixed and to take the next order correction into account . with this approach we obtained good agreement between all nep from our md - simulation and those from the mct - equations @xcite .",
    "but even if the first correction to the von schweidler law ( cf .",
    "9 ) is taken into account , the fit with eq .",
    "9 works well for only about one decade in time . on the other hand , the critical correlator ( with @xmath194 ) including the correction ( on the von schweidler side ) fits the data over two decades .",
    "nevertheless , this range is significantly smaller than the one found for @xmath2 which shows that corrections to the scaling laws might be more important for @xmath187 than for @xmath186 .",
    "the quantities @xmath36 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 , depicted in fig .",
    "18 were determined in a similar way as for the self part , i.e. by keeping the value of @xmath53 fixed to 0.55 . comparing these quantities with @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "1 ) we find that @xmath36 is in phase and both , @xmath195 and @xmath196 in anti - phase with @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the peak at @xmath197 in @xmath36 does not exist for @xmath3 .",
    "however , whether this peak is real or just a statistical fluctuation can presently not be decided for sure . since the static correlator @xmath198 has a pronounced maximum at @xmath199 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one might be tempted to relate this prepeak of @xmath200 to the translation - rotation coupling .",
    "the variation of @xmath36 and @xmath195 with @xmath5 resembles the one found , e.g. , for hard spheres @xcite , for a binary liquid @xcite and that for water molecules @xcite .",
    "interestingly the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath196 , which is in phase with that of @xmath195 , qualitatively agrees with that found by fuchs _",
    "_ for hard spheres @xcite",
    ". however , in contrast to the hard sphere system , @xmath196 does not change sign for the @xmath5-regime we have studied , but vanishes at @xmath2 at which it has a minimum .",
    "this fact explains why the ( asymptotic ) von schweidler law fits the data rather well for @xmath2 , where @xmath201 , but not for @xmath4 . to conclude",
    "we show in fig .",
    "19 that also the variation of the @xmath6-relaxation time @xmath8 with @xmath5 is in phase with @xmath3 , which is in close analogy with , e.g. , the hard sphere system @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have performed a detailed test of the predictions of ideal mct ( for simple liquids ) for the translational degrees of freedom ( tdof ) for a supercooled liquid of rigid diatomic molecules without head - tail symmetry .",
    "the lennard - jones interactions we used for the molecular system are not so different from those of the binary liquid @xcite with @xmath202 a- and @xmath203 b - atoms .",
    "the main difference between both systems of course is , that for the present case the @xmath204 a- and @xmath205 b - atoms are pairwise connected in order to form diatomic molecules .",
    "therefore the comparison of the dynamical behavior of both systems , allows to discuss the influence of the orientational degrees of freedom ( odof ) on tdof .",
    "our test was mainly concerned with ( i ) the existence of a single critical temperature @xmath0 and ( ii ) the validity of the two scaling laws of ideal mct .",
    "this single critical temperature indicates a strong coupling between tdof and odof .",
    "although the mathematical structure of the mct - equations for molecular liquids @xcite differs from the one of simple liquids , we expect that the two scaling laws hold for molecular liquids , too .",
    "this belief is based upon the fact that the first scaling law is always valid in a so - called type b transition ( i.e. the nep changes _ discontinuously _ at the transition ) , the type of transition that is relevant for structural glasses  @xcite .",
    "furthermore the existence of a single transition temperature for linear and arbitrary molecules without additional symmetry can also be proved for the molecular mct - equation @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath0 and @xmath10 as free parameters , the @xmath6-relaxation times @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath2 and @xmath4 can be fitted with a power law .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 s differ from @xmath0 = 0.475 ( deduced from @xmath119 ) by less than @xmath161 .",
    "the same value of @xmath0 was found for the orientational correlation functions in ref .",
    "@xcite and we therefore conclude that our data is compatible with the existence of a single transition temperature . the sharp transition at @xmath0 , as predicted by _ ideal _ mct , is however smeared out , due to ergodicity restoring processes which can be accounted for by the extended mct @xcite .",
    "these processes are often associated with a hopping of the atoms or molecules , as it has been demonstrated for a binary liquid @xcite .",
    "an evidence for such hopping processes is the occurrence of a second peak in @xmath122 at @xmath206 for large times  @xcite .",
    "but no such peak is observed in our results , even beyond the @xmath121-range shown in fig .",
    "the absence of hopping processes with respect to the tdof was also found in the md - simulation of ckn @xcite .",
    "therefore only orientational jumps remain , which indeed have been shown to be present @xcite . comparing the different values of @xmath10",
    ", one finds that those determined from @xmath146 and @xmath21 fluctuate around 2.55 .",
    "the same is more or less true for the purely orientational correlators @xmath207 and @xmath208 [ 17 ] for @xmath209 , but not for @xmath28 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 was found .",
    "this result demonstrates that , contrary to the prediction of ideal mct , @xmath10 is not a `` universal '' exponent for our system .",
    "such a conclusion was already drawn for binary liquids @xcite .",
    "we note however , that this discrepancy does not seem to exist for the md - simulation of water @xcite .",
    "for all the correlators related to the tdof , the second scaling law is reasonably well fulfilled .",
    "this is in contrast to our findings for @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite . only for relatively large values of @xmath212",
    "do the @xmath207 show the second scaling law .",
    "regarding the first scaling law we can say that it works well for @xmath146 and @xmath21 . for @xmath4",
    "we have demonstrated that the next correction to the von schweidler law becomes important .",
    "we stress that a consistent description of our data in the framework of mct is only possible by taking this correction into account . if this is not done , a @xmath5-dependent von schweidler exponent and a rather structureless @xmath5-variation of the orientational nep ( which will be discussed in the following paper  @xcite ) results .",
    "the critical law is not observed for any of the correlators , even if the next correction is taken into account .",
    "this is probably due to a strong interference of the critical dynamics with the microscopic motion .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that , with respect to ideal mct , the tdof of our molecular system behave quite similar as found for a binary liquid @xcite . hence , the qualitative features of the dynamics of tdof is not altered by its coupling to odof .",
    "although a single transition temperature for tdof and odof can be specified , part of the orientational dynamics as measured , e.g. by @xmath13 , does not fit into the framework of ideal mct @xcite . whether this is only due to the @xmath213-reorientational jumps @xcite , is presently not clear .",
