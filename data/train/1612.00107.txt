    "the orion bn / kl region has long been known to exhibit the evidence of a violent explosive phenomenon that took place some 500 years ago ( e.g. bally & zinnecker 2005 ; gmez et al .",
    "filaments of molecular gas ( the so - called orion h@xmath3 fingers ; e.g. bally et al .",
    "2015 ; youngblood et al .",
    "2016 ) are moving away from a common origin at velocities in the range of tens to hundreds of km s@xmath0 .",
    "the inner parts of this outflowing molecular gas have been imaged in co by zapata et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and exhibit the same behavior .",
    "three compact radio sources , believed to trace stellar objects , are also known to recede from the same location at transverse velocities in the range of 15 to 26 km s@xmath0 ( gmez et al .",
    "the proper motions of these compact objects , known as sources bn , i and n , have been studied also by goddi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who confirmed the proper motions for sources bn and i previously determined by gmez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) but noted that their measurements were consistent with a null proper motion for source n. in this paper we reanalyze the proper motions of these compact radio sources taking advantage of the existence of new observations of high quality .",
    "the data discussed here cover the period from 1991.67 to 2014.17 , about 50% larger than that used by gmez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . since the accuracy of the proper motion determinations improves with time as t@xmath4 ( dzib et al .",
    "2016 ) our results are about a factor of 2 more accurate than those reported in gmez et al .",
    "to improve the determination of the proper motions of sources bn , i and n , we analyzed very large array ( vla ) and jansky vla archive observations made at 7 epochs between 1991.67 and 2014.17 . in the case of the bright radio source bn",
    "we were able to add a previous observation of lower sensitivity made in 1985.05 .",
    "these epochs were selected on the basis of a combination of the best angular angular resolution and sensitivity possibles . in particular , all are made in the highest angular resolution a configuration .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of source n we did not take into account the observations of 2011.56 when the emission was seriously affected by the free - free emission from a cloud of ionized gas ( see below for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the data were analyzed in the standard manner using the aips ( astronomical imaging processing system ) and the casa ( common astronomy software applications ) packages of nrao , the former one for the vla observations and the latter one for the jansky vla observations . in the calibration stage",
    "we used the pipeline provided for jansky vla observations by nrao .",
    "the final analysis and production of contour images was all made within the older but more mature aips software .",
    "the detailed analysis of a subset of the data is presented in gmez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .    in table 1",
    "we show the proper motions determined for sources bn , i and n. the proper motions were calculated adding in quadrature systematic errors of order @xmath5 to the formal position uncertainties to obtain a reduced @xmath6 = 1 .",
    "the proper motions for source bn and i coincide within about @xmath7@xmath8 to @xmath9@xmath8 with those of gmez et al .",
    "this result supports a ballistic ( i.e. unaccelerated ) motion for these two sources .",
    "the interpretation of the proper motions of source n will be discussed below .",
    "in the bottom panels of figures 1 and 2 we show the contour images of these two sources for epochs 1991.67 and 2012.76 , where the displacement is evident . in the top panels of these figures",
    "we also show the positions of sources bn and i as a function of time .",
    "clearly , the motions follow a straight line within the noise .    -0.0",
    "cm      we now discuss the proper motions of the double source n. source n appeared as double in the north - south direction for the three observations made in the period from 1991.67 to 2000.87 ( see figure 8 of gmez et al .",
    ". we will refer to these components as nn and ns .",
    "however , by 2006.36 the double source appeared unresolved , as a single elongated object ( see figure 8 of gmez et al .",
    "2008 ) . in figure 3",
    "we show the contour images for epochs 1991.67 and 2012.76 .",
    "the image for 1991.67 clearly shows the double morphology . the image for 2012.67 is complex and",
    "can be described as constituted of two components , but much more separated and of different morphology than those components seen in 1991.67 .",
    "we interpret this image as follows .",
    "the northern component is taken to be the double source that remains spatially unresolved , as first observed in 2006.36 .",
    "the southern component is interpreted as a cloud of ionized plasma that was ejected from one of the stars in the double system sometime after 2006.36 .",
    "the proper motions reported in table 1 and shown in figure 3 are obtained from fitting the double stellar component , with the position being the average of the double source , or the centroid of a single elongated source when the double source was not resolved ( which is the case for all images taken after 2006.36 ) .",
    "this set of data contains two new observations with respect to the data used by gmez et al .",
    "new observations over the following years are needed to test if the proper motions reported here predict the future position of the centroid of the double stellar source .",
    "if we assume that the ejection took place after 2006.36 , we can estimate lower limits to the proper motion of the ejecta from the position shown in figure 3 .",
    "if we assume that it was ejected from the northern stellar component , we obtain a lower limit for the proper motion of @xmath10110 mas yr@xmath0 , while if it was ejected from the southern stellar component we obtain a lower limit for the proper motion of @xmath1060 mas yr@xmath0 . at a distance of 414 pc ( menten et al .",
    "2007 , see however a new estimate of 388 pc by kounkel et al .",
    "2016 ) , these proper motions are equivalent to velocities in the plane of the sky of 220 km s@xmath0 and 120 km s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "these velocities are comparable to those observed in the proper motions of ejecta from young , intermediate - mass stars ( e.g. rodrguez - kamenetzky et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the ejecta has to be dominantly one - sided ( approximately to the south ) , because we do not see a major distortion in the northern component .",
    "one - sided ejecta ( sometimes called monopolar or asymmetric jets ) from young stars is not an uncommon phenomenon and has been observed in sources such as omc 1 south ( zapata et al .",
    "2006 ) , dg tau ( rodrguez et al .",
    "2012a ) , dg taub ( rodrguez et al .",
    "2012b ) , hh  111 ( gmez et al . 2013 ) , ngc 1333-iras2a ( codella et al . 2014 ) and serpens smm1 ( hull et al . 2016 ) .",
    "there are two ways to test this scenario .",
    "first , if the emission observed recently to the south of the double source is produced by ejected plasma , we expect the ejecta to become fainter on a recombination timescale . from the 2012.76 observations ( see figure 3 ) , we measure a flux density for the southern condensation of @xmath11 , and an angular size @xmath12 . assuming optically thin free - free emission , an electron temperature @xmath13 k , the emission measure is @xmath14 \\left[{\\theta_s \\over 0.2 \\arcsec } \\right]^{-2}.$ ] assuming a characteristic scale @xmath15 , where @xmath16 pc is the distance to orion , the electron density of the plasma is @xmath17^{1/2 }   \\left ( { \\theta_s \\over 0.2 \\arcsec } \\right)^{-3/2}. $ ] the ejected plasma will recombine in a timescale @xmath18 where the recombination coefficient is @xmath19 . assuming a proper motion of the ejecta @xmath20 60 mas yr@xmath0 , that corresponds in orion to 120 km s@xmath0 , the crossing time is @xmath21 because @xmath22 , one expects the plasma to recombine as it moves away from the source",
    ".    furthermore , if the ionized plasma is expanding , the density will drop .",
    "if the expansion is isotropic , the plasma volume is @xmath23 and the electron density will decrease like @xmath24 . for a jet condensation expanding with a fixed solid angle @xmath25 , at a distance @xmath26 from the source , the volume is @xmath27 .",
    "if the size @xmath28constant , the volume will increase as @xmath29 and the electron density will decrease like @xmath30 .",
    "the optically thin radio flux density is @xmath31 , and it will decrease like @xmath32 in the isotropic case , and like @xmath33 in the case of the jet condensation . both types of flux density decrease were observed in the thermal radio jet hh 80 - 81 by mart   et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who studied the evolution of two jet condensations . in any case",
    ", one expects that the observed radio emission of the ejection would decrease very fast both due to recombination and expansion of the ionized gas .",
    "the assumption that we are dealing with optically thin free - free emission in the ejecta is supported by an analysis of the spectral index of source n in epoch 2012.76 . using the data of forbrich et al .",
    "( 2016 ) we obtain a total flux density of 1.45@xmath10.03 mjy at 7.3 ghz and of 1.68@xmath10.05 mjy at 4.7 ghz , this gives a spectral index of -0.3@xmath10.1 , in agreement with forbrich et al .",
    "( 2016 ) . for the southern component ( the ejecta )",
    "we obtain flux densities of 0.45@xmath10.02 and 0.49@xmath10.03 at 7.3 and 4.7 ghz , respectively .",
    "this results in a spectral index of -0.2@xmath10.2 , consistent with optically thin free - free - emission .",
    "finally , for the northern component ( proposed here to be the unresolved double stellar source ) we obtain flux densities of 1.00@xmath10.02 and 1.19@xmath10.04 at 7.3 and 4.7 ghz , respectively .",
    "this gives a spectral index of -0.4@xmath10.1 , suggesting a possible non - thermal component .",
    "the total flux density of source n as a function of time ( figure 4 ) shows an important increment in epoch 2011.56 .",
    "we believe that this increase ( that has practically disappeared in more recent epochs ) was the result of the ejection of the plasma cloud .",
    "one can also estimate the mass - loss rate of an ionized jet , @xmath34 @xmath35^{1/2 }   \\left[{\\theta_s \\over 0.2 \\arcsec}\\right]^{1/2 } m_\\odot ~yr^{-1}. $ ] assuming a jet ionization fraction @xmath36 , one obtains a total mass - loss rate @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that source n must have an accretion disk with a healthy mass accretion rate , one order of magnitude larger , @xmath38 ( e.g. , shu et al . 1993 ) .",
    "finally , anglada et al . (",
    "2015 ) proposed a correlation between the radio luminosity of the jet , @xmath39 , and the bolometric luminosity of the source , @xmath40 ( their eq .",
    "[ 3 ] ) . assuming a flat spectrum",
    ", this relation gives a luminosity @xmath41 . from the observed ir fluxes from 5 - 10 @xmath42 ( gezari et al .",
    "1998 ) , one obtains a lower limit to the luminosity of source n , @xmath43 .    the second way of testing the scenario is to verify that the proper motions derived for source n excluding the southern ejecta are consistent with the epoch of cluster disintegration , as determined from the well - behaved proper motions of sources bn and i. to pursue this test , in table 2 we give the proper motions corrected for the mean proper motions of the trapezium - bn / kl region ( @xmath44 = 1.07@xmath10.09 mas / yr ; @xmath45 = -0.84@xmath10.16 mas / yr ) , as determined by dzib et al .",
    "this relatively small correction is required to present the proper motions in the rest frame of orion . in figure 5 we present the position of the sources bn , i and n as a function of time , as extrapolated from the proper motions in table 2 .",
    "the angle associated with each source represents the 2-@xmath8 error in the proper motions .",
    "we can see that the past positions of bn , i and n overlap in the past both in right ascension as in declination .",
    "the data are consistent with a disintegration epoch during the xvth century with an initial position of @xmath46 ; @xmath47 .",
    "the more accurate determination using only the relative positions of bn and i gives a disintegration epoch of 1490@xmath111 ( gmez et al .",
    "2008 ) and , with additional data points , of 1453@xmath19 ( goddi et al .",
    "2011 ) . with more data available",
    ", we will repeat below this determination .    in figure 6",
    "we show the location of the three sources and , with arrows , the proper motions in the frame of orion for a period of 200 years .",
    "as discussed by gmez et al . ( 2008 ) , the minimum separation between bn and source i and when it took place in the past can be estimated accurately using relative astrometry between these two sources .",
    "this determination is very accurate because the relative astrometry is not affected by most of the error sources present in the absolute astrometry .",
    "following gmez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we define as @xmath48 and @xmath49 the separations in right ascension and declination of bn with respect to source i as a function of epoch @xmath50 and as @xmath51 and @xmath52 the proper motions in right ascension and declination .",
    "the minimum separation takes place at an epoch @xmath53 given by    @xmath54    and that this minimum separation is    @xmath55    the least squares fit to 23 data points ( 14 from gmez et al .",
    "2008 and 9 from this paper ) from the vla , jansky vla and alma archives ( shown in table 3 and figure 7 ) gives @xmath56 arcsec , @xmath57 arcsec yr@xmath0 ,    @xmath58 arcsec , @xmath59 arcsec yr@xmath0 .    with these values ,",
    "we obtain :    @xmath60    @xmath61    where the errors were calculated using standard propagation error theory ( wall & jenkins 2003 ) .",
    "the inclusion in this analysis of observations of different configurations and frequencies ( and even different radio telescopes , one data point comes from alma ) can affect the results .",
    "we argue , however , that both bn and source i are quite compact and that the determination of their centroids is not greatly affected by angular resolution , except in the sense that the precision of the astrometrical positions depends linearly with angular resolution but that this effect should not produce systematic shifts . as far as it is known",
    ", the soures do not present optical depth effects that could produce frequency - dependent displacements in the positions . finally , as already noted above",
    ", the astrometry of this section is relative and this minimizes position shifts produced by the use of different complex gain calibrators .",
    "we conclude that , about 540 years ago , bn and source i were within less than @xmath62 ( 3-@xmath8 upper limit ) from each other in the plane of the sky . at a distance of 414 pc",
    "this corresponds to a physical separation of @xmath2120 au .",
    "we conclude that if by that epoch bn and/or source i had protoplanetary disks of typical dimensions ( i.e. 100 au ) the gas in these disks must have suffered a major disruption and could have originated the explosive molecular outflow present in the region .",
    "this result , however , poses a difficulty for the cluster disruption scenario as recently stressed by plambeck & wright ( 2016 ) .",
    "these authors show , from alma observations , that source i has at present a disk with mass in the range of 0.020.2 @xmath63 and a diameter of @xmath2100 au .",
    "they note that such a massive disk could not have formed in only 500 years from bondi - hoyle accretion ( gravitational focusing ) as source i moves in the dense ( @xmath210@xmath64 @xmath65 ) ambient medium of the bn / kl region .",
    "however , goddi et al . ( 2011 ) have pointed out that if source i existed as a softer binary before the close encounter this could have enabled preservation of the original accretion disk , although truncated to its present radius of @xmath250 au .",
    "the numerical analysis of moeckel & goddi ( 2012 ) confirms to first order the plausibility of the scattering scenario of goddi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and suggests that the original disk was largely preserved .",
