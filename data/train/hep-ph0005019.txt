    "testing the qcd dynamics of heavy quarks in various conditions provides us with a qualitative and quantitative knowledge that allows us to distinguish fine complex effects caused by the electroweak nature of cp - violation or physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the list of hadrons containing the heavy quarks as available to the experimental observations and measurements , was recently enriched by a new member , the long - lived @xmath5-meson , in addition to the heavy quarkonia @xmath6 and @xmath7 as well as the mesons and baryons with a single heavy quark .",
    "this success of cdf collaboration in the first observation of @xmath5-meson @xcite was based on the progress of experimental technique in the reconstruction of rare processes with heavy quarks by use of vertex detectors .",
    "this experience supports a hope to observe other rare long - lived doubly heavy hadrons .",
    "i.e. the baryons containing two heavy quarks .",
    "as expected they have production rate @xcite and lifetime @xcite similar to the @xmath5-meson ones .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the two - point sum rules @xcite of nrqcd @xcite .",
    "the light quark - doubly heavy diquark structure of baryon leads to the definite expressions for baryonic currents written in terms of nonrelativistic heavy quark fields . to relate the nonrelativstic heavy quark correlators to the full qcd ones we need to take into account the hard gluon corrections by means of solving the renormalization group equation known up to the two - loop accuracy .",
    "the convergency of sum rules results are essentially improved by account for a nonzero light quark mass . as was mentioned in @xcite the sum rules stability",
    "can be achieved by destroying the baryon - diquark factorization in the correlators .",
    "the convergency was obtained due to taking into account the nonperturbative interactions caused by higher dimension operators in contrast to ref.@xcite , where a signigicant instability of results were observed in full qcd sum rules with no product of quark and gluon condensates .",
    "we show that for the strange @xmath3 baryons this factorization is broken already in the perturbative limit which allows us to introduce a new criterion for the determination of baryon masses since we observe the stability of sum rules for the masses obtained from both correlators standing in front of two independent lorentz structures for the spinor field of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover our choice of baryonic current is convenient to take into account the @xmath8 coulomb - like corrections @xcite inside the doubly heavy diquark .    in section",
    "ii we describe the scheme of calculation .",
    "there we define the currents and represent the spectral densities in the nrqcd sum rules for various operators included into the consideration .",
    "the numerical estimates in comparison with the values obtained in potential models are given in section iii .",

    "in order to determine the masses and coupling constants of baryons in sum rules we consider the two point correlators of interpolating baryon currents .",

    "this fact was the physical reason for the divergency of sr method .",
    "we write down the wilson coefficient in front of unity and quark - gluon operators by making use of the dispersion relation over @xmath30 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the imaginary part in the physical region of nrqcd .",
    "to relate the nrqcd correlators to the real hadrons , we use the dispersion representation for the two point function with the physical spectral density given by the appropriate resonance and continuum part .",
    "the coupling constants of baryons are defined by the following expressions : @xmath52 where the spinor field with the four - velocity @xmath53 and mass @xmath54 ( the mass of baryon ) satisfies the equation @xmath55 , and @xmath56 denotes the transversal spinor .",
    "then we use the nonrelativistic expressions for the physical spectral functions @xmath57 where we have performed the substitution @xmath58 , here @xmath59 is the binding energy of baryon and @xmath60 . the nonrelativistic dispersion relation for the hadronic part of sum rules has the form @xmath61",
    "we suppose that the continuum densities starting from the threshold @xmath62 , is modelled by the nrqcd expressions .",
    "then , in the sum rules equalizing the correlators calculated in nrqcd and given by the physical states , the integration above @xmath62 cancel each other in two sides of sum rules .",
    "further , we write down the correlators in the deep underthreshold point of @xmath63 with @xmath64 .    now",
    "the sum rules in the scheme of moments with respect to @xmath65 can be written down as follows : @xmath66 where @xmath67 contains the contributions given by various operators in ope for the corresponding scalar functions @xmath68 . introducing the following notation for the @xmath69-th moment of two point correlation function :",

    "we present analytical expression for the perturbative spectral functions in the nrqcd approximation .",
    "the evaluation of spectral densities involves the standard use of cutkosky rules @xcite , with some modification motivated by nrqcd @xmath73 we derive the spin symmetry relations for all the spectral densities due to the fact that in the leading order of the heavy quark effective theory the spins of heavy quarks are decoupled , so @xmath74 @xmath75 and we have the following relation for the baryon couplings in nrqcd : @xmath76 using the smallness of the strange quark mass we use the following expansions in @xmath34 for the perturbative spectral densities standing in front of unity operator ( @xmath77 is the reduced diquark mass , @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 where we have found @xmath80 the first term of this expansion reproduces the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "a new feature is the appearance of nonzero perturbative @xmath81 density which is proportional to @xmath34 , @xmath82 and @xmath83    the account for the coulomb - like interaction leads to the finite renormalization of the diquark spectral densities before the integration over the diquark invariant mass by the introduction of sommerfeld factor * c * , so that @xmath84 with @xmath85^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 denotes the relative velocity of heavy quarks inside the diquark , and we have taken into account the color anti - triplet structure of diquark .",
    "the relative velocity is given by the following expression : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the square of heavy diquark four - momentum .",
    "in nrqcd we take the limit of low velocities , so that denoting the diquark invariant mass squared by @xmath89 , we find @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "the corrected spectral densities are equal to @xmath92 where @xmath93 we see that the first term again reproduces the result of @xcite . for the @xmath94",
    "we find @xmath95 @xmath96 the use of these expansions numerically leads to very small deviations from the exact integral representations of spectral densities ( about 0.5% ) , but they are more convenient in calculations .",
    "the contribution to the moments of the spectral densities determined by the light quark condensate can be calculated by the exploration of ( [ exp ] ) @xmath97 where we have introduced the coefficients of expansion in @xmath98 by @xmath99 ( see ( [ exp ] ) and appendix ) .",
    "the n - th moment of two - point correlator function of diquark is denoted by @xmath100 .",
    "then the diquark spectral density takes the following form : @xmath101 which has to be multiplied by the sommerfeld factor @xmath102 , wherein the variable @xmath103 is substituted by @xmath104 , since in this case there is no integration over the quark - diquark invariant mass .",
    "this corrected density is @xmath105 and it is independent of @xmath104 .",
    "the corrections due to the gluon condensate are given by the density @xmath106 with @xmath107 where we again make the expansion in @xmath34 .",
    "in the case of nonzero quark mass we get the nonzero density proportional to @xmath34 , @xmath108 with @xmath109 for the product of condensates @xmath110 , wherein the gluon fields are connected to the heavy quarks , it is convenient to compute the contribution to the two - point correlation function itself .",
    "we have found @xmath111 and we put @xmath112 , since we have restricted the dimension of condensate operators , while the corresponding term in @xmath49 would appear in the fifth order in expansion ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "the result is given in the form , which allows the analytical continuation over @xmath113 .",
    "to connect the nrqcd sum rules to the baryonic couplings in full qcd we have to use the relation @xmath114 where the coefficient @xmath115 depends on the soft normalization scale @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath117-factor obeys the matching condition at the hard scale @xmath118 and is determined by the anomalous dimensions of effective baryonic currents which are independent of the diquark spin in the leading order .",
    "they are known up to the two loop accuracy @xcite . in our consideration",
    "we use the one - loop accuracy , since the subleading corrections in the first @xmath119 order are not available yet .",

    "and we get @xmath126 .",
    "so , in the leading logarithmic approximation and to the one - loop accuracy we find @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "further , we determine the soft normalization scale for the nrqcd estimates by the average momentum transfer inside the doubly heavy diquark , so that @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the kinetic energy in the system of two heavy quarks , which is phenomenologically independent of the heavy quark flavours and approximately equal to 0.2 gev @xcite",
    ". then , the coefficients @xmath131 are equal to @xmath132 with the characteristic uncertainty about @xmath133 basically due to the variation of hard and soft scale points @xmath134 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath131 do not change the estimates of baryon masses , but they are essential in the evaluation of baryon couplings .",
    "evaluating the two - point sum rules , we explore the scheme of moments .",
    "we point out the well - known fact that an essential part of uncertainties is caused by the variation of heavy quark masses .",
    "indeed , the results of sum rules for the systems containing two heavy quarks strongly depend on the choice of masses , and this fact allows us to pin down the values of masses with a high precision up to 20 mev @xcite , so that @xmath135gev , @xmath136gev , which are extracted from the two - point sum rules for the families of @xmath137 and @xmath138 . to get these values",
    "we have use the correlators evaluated up to the same accuracy in @xmath119 , i.e. we have put the quark loop with the appropriate sommerfeld factor .",
    "then , the stability criterion for the leptonic constant of heavy quarkonium strictly fixes the heavy quark masses , which are close to the results of @xcite .",
    "the same sum rules are also explored to estimate the couplings determining the coulomb - like interactions inside the heavy quarkonia @xmath139 since they fix the absolute normalization of corresponding leptonic constants known experimentally .    since the squared size of diquark is two times larger than that of the meson the effective coulumb constants have to be rescaled according to the equation of evolution in qcd .",
    "we use the one - loop evolution equation @xmath140 so , @xmath141 the values of condensates are taken in the ranges @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 .",
    "the main source of uncertainties in the ratios of the baryonic couplings is the ratio of the condensates of the strange quark and light quark .",
    "we use @xmath145 that corresponds to the variations of the sum @xmath146 = 12\\div14~$ ] mev @xcite .",
    "so , we have described the set of parameters entering the scheme of calculations . in figs .",
    "[ m1]-[m ] we present the results of the two - point sum rules for the masses of @xmath147 and @xmath148  ( the figures for the other baryons are similar ) . for the @xmath148-baryons",
    "one can observe the stability of mass with respect to the changing of the moment numbers in both correlators .",
    "we suppose it is connected with the destroying of diquark-@xmath149baryon factorization in the perturbative limit in contrast to the @xmath150-baryons .",
    "the stability regions for @xmath49 and @xmath48 are not coincide because the contributions of higher dimension operators become valuable at the different numbers of moments .",
    "however , the quantity @xmath151+m_2[n])$ ] has the larger stability region , and we explore this fact to determine the @xmath152 baryons masses as well as that of @xmath150 baryons .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in the @xmath152-baryon masses are mainly determined by the difference between the values of baryon masses at the regions of stability .",

    "so , for the masses we find the following results : @xmath156 the obtained values are in agreement with the calculations in the framework of nonrelativistic potential models @xcite , though the models based on the calculation of three body systems with the pair interactions @xcite give slightly higher values of masses . in @xcite the other method of baryon mass determination was used , since the quantities @xmath157 and @xmath158 separately have no good stability in the sum rules .",

    "the nonrelativistic approximation for the heavy quark fields allows us to fix the structure of baryonic currents ( the light quark - doubly heavy diquark ) and to take into account the coulomb - like interactions inside the doubly heavy diquark .",
    "the presence of both the nonzero mass of light quark and the contribution of nonperturbative terms of the quark , gluon , mixed condensates and the product of condensates destroys the factorization of the correlators .",

    "<S> in the framework of two - point sum rules of nrqcd , the masses and couplings of doubly heavy baryons to the corresponding quark currents are evaluated with account of coulomb - like corrections in the system of doubly heavy diquark as well as the contribution of nonperturbative terms determined by the quark , gluon , mixed condensates and the product of gluon and quark condensates . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of nonzero light quark mass destroys the factorization of baryon and diquark correlators even at the perturbative level and provides the better convergency of sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the difference @xmath0mev . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of baryonic constants @xmath1 is equal to @xmath2 indicating the violation of su(3 ) flavor symmetry for the doubly heavy baryons .    # </S>",
