    "presupernova stars in the mass range above @xmath09@xmath8 exhibit large variations of their structure with respect to , e.g. , their fe - core and o - core masses , their binding energies , and their density or entropy profiles above the fe - core @xcite .",
    "these properties vary non - monotonically with the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) mass and can differ considerably even between progenitors with only a small difference of their zams masses @xcite .    correspondingly , @xcite found that the properties of neutrino - driven supernovae ( sne ) like explosion energy , nickel mass , and remnant mass change non - monotonically with the zams mass . in particular , for the investigated grid of 101 solar - metallicity progenitors binned in 0.2@xmath9 steps @xcite , they found islands of non - exploding , black hole ( bh ) forming cases down to 15@xmath8 , alternating with mass - intervals of exploding progenitors . in a few cases individual neighboring progenitors showed opposite behavior .",
    "@xcite used a simple , parametric model for the contracting proto - neutron star ( pns ) as a neutrino source to trigger neutrino - driven explosions in spherically symmetric ( 1d ) hydrodynamic simulations , but their basic findings were confirmed by other groups working with semi - analytic descriptions in 1d @xcite and approximate neutrino transport in two- and three - dimensional ( 2d , 3d ) hydrodynamic models @xcite . while @xcite suggested that bh formation requires a compactness ( normalized enclosed mass - radius ratio ) of @xmath10 with @xmath11 @xcite obtained only explosions for @xmath12 , explosions or bh formation for 0.15@xmath130.35 , and only bh formation for @xmath14 , which implies a larger fraction of bh formation cases for solar - metallicity stars .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a critical compactness of @xmath15 for failed explosions is compatible with a lack of red supergiant type - iip sn progenitors above @xmath016@xmath8 @xcite and with a significant excess of the star - formation rate compared to the observed sn rate @xcite .",

    "are there characteristic parameters of the pre - supernova star that decide better about success or failure of the explosion than a single value of the compactness or other , similarly useful parameters like the iron - core mass or the binding energy outside of the iron core ?",
    "while all these measures reflect trends like an enhanced tendency of bh formation for high compactness , large iron - core mass or high exterior binding energy , there are still many outliers that do not obey the correlations .",
    "for example , a suitably chosen mass @xmath16 of the compactness @xmath17 allows to correctly predict explosions in @xmath1890% of the cases @xcite , but the best choice of @xmath16 is merely empirical and the physical justification of @xmath17 as a good diagnostics is unclear .    here",
    "we propose a two - parameter criterion that separates successful explosions from failures with very high reliability . while two compactness values , e.g.  @xmath19 and @xmath20 , or the iron - core mass and the mean entropy in some suitable mass range begin to show such a disentanglement",

    "because of the `` gentle '' acceleration of the sn shock by the neutrino - driven mechanism ( also in 3d simulations , see * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath39 in table  [ table : calibration ] mainly measures this component but also contains @xmath30ni from proton - rich neutrino - processed ejecta .",
    "however , also neutrino - processed ejecta and the neutrino - driven wind with a slight neutron excess could contribute significantly to the @xmath30ni production .",
    "the electron fraction @xmath32 of these ejecta is set by @xmath40 and @xmath41 interactions and depends extremely sensitively on the properties ( luminosities and spectra ) of the emitted neutrinos , which our transport approximation can not reliably predict and which also depend on subtle effects connected to multi - dimensional physics and neutrino opacities .",

    "we point out that the crab supernova sn  1054 is considered to be connected to the explosion of a @xmath010@xmath8 star ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and its explosion energy is estimated to be up to only @xmath010@xmath49erg ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this fact lends support to the results of recent , self - consistent 1d and multi - dimensional supernova models of @xmath5010@xmath8 stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whose low explosion energies and low nickel production agree with the crab observations .    although as a consequence of our @xmath47 reduction the explosion times , @xmath51 , tend to be late for stars in the 10.512.5@xmath8 range ( fig .  [",
    "fig : explosionprops ] ) , this behavior also seems to be compatible with self - consistent , multi - dimensional simulations of stellar explosions in the 1112@xmath8 range by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , where these stars were found to have a long - lasting phase of accretion and simultaneous mass outflow after a quite inert onset of the explosion .",

    "[ sec : calibration ] and can also be found in a follow - up paper by @xcite , where the values of all pns core - model parameters are tabulated for all calibrations .",
    "it must be emphasized that in the context of the present work the detailed treatment of the low - mass stars is not overly important .",
    "these stars usually explode fairly easily , independent of the treatment of the pns core model with the original or with our revised calibration .",
    "therefore these stars lie far away from the boundary curve that separates exploding from non - exploding models and whose determination will be our main goal in sect .  [",

    "[ eq : dmdr ] , the iron - core mass @xmath52 ) are measured when the stars possess a central density of @xmath53g@xmath26 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "this choice of reference density defines a clear standard for the comparison of stellar profiles of different progenitors ( cf .",
    "appendix  a of * ? ? ?",
    "different from the moment of core bounce , which was used in other works , our reference density has the advantage to be still close to the initial state of the pre - collapse models provided by stellar evolution modeling and therefore to yield values of the structural parameters that are more similar to those of the pre - collapse progenitor data .",
    "our calibration model w15.0 , however , must be treated as an exception . because pre - collapse profiles of this model are not available any more , all structural quantities for this case are given ( roughly ) at core bounce .",
    "`` ab initio '' , fully self - consistent simulations of stellar core collapse with state - of - the - art treatment of microphysics and neutrino transport do not lead to explosions in spherical symmetry except for stars with o - ne - mg and fe - cores near the low - mass end of sn progenitors @xcite .",
    "2d simulations in the recent past have produced successful explosions and underline the fundamental importance of multidimensional effects , but the true meaning of these results with respect to the neutrino - driven mechanism is not finally clear and the current situation is diffuse and contradictive .",
    "on the one hand , some of the 2d explosions set in relatively late and might remain on the weak side ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although such apprehension is speculative because not all simulations could be continued until the explosion energy had saturated @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the oak ridge group obtained explosions much earlier after bounce with shock evolutions being astonishingly similar for 12 , 15 , 20 , and 25@xmath8 stars and explosion energies fairly compatible with observations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite did not find any successes in 2d simulations of the same progenitors but they used a different treatment of gravity , hydrodynamics , equation of state , neutrino transport , and neutrino opacities .",
    "the exact reasons for the different findings will have to be clarified by detailed tests and comparisons .",
    "the situation is even more diffuse because current 3d simulations agree in showing slower explosions compared to 2d calculations or even no explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although some studies have proclaimed the opposite behavior @xcite .",
    "so far only a few recent 3d calculations with highly refined neutrino treatment have obtained successful shock revival by the neutrino - driven mechanism @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the 3d simulation of a low - mass ( 9.6@xmath8 ) progenitor with detailed neutrino physics , whose explosion energy approached its saturation level , was found to explode more energetically in 3d than in 2d @xcite .",
    "this result is in line with a 2d-3d comparison in the 1112@xmath8 range conducted by @xcite . in both studies accretion",
    "downflows and the re - ejection of neutrino - heated matter were observed to be different in 2d and 3d because of geometry dependent differences of the kelvin - helmholtz instability and flow fragmentation .",
    "the 3d models therefore suggest that explosions in 2d are massively affected by the assumption of rotational symmetry around the polar grid axis and by an inverse turbulent energy cascade , which tends to amplify energy on the largest possible scales @xcite and also produces numerical artifacts in the post - explosion accretion phase of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "it must therefore be suspected that the early onset of explosions and the extremely unipolar or bipolar deformations along the symmetry axis obtained in many 2d models could be artifacts of the imposed symmetry constraints .      before 3d modeling will have become a routine task and results",
    "will have converged , neutrino - driven explosions of large sets of progenitor stars can be explored for their observational implications only by referring to simplified modeling approaches .",
    "several different recipes have been introduced for this recently .",
    "@xcite used an analytic pns core - cooling model in connection with a neutrino transport approximation in 1d hydrodynamic explosion simulations ( as briefly summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] ) , thus improving the simpler , time - dependent boundary neutrino luminosity prescribed by previous users of the simulation code @xcite and the even simpler neutrino light - bulb treatment ( without any transport approximation ) applied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite resorted to a scaling parameter @xmath54 to artificially enhance the neutrino heating by charged - current processes behind the stalled shock in 1d hydrodynamic models with approximate neutrino treatment .",
    "@xcite performed an extensive set of 2d simulations with simplified neutrino transport despite the grains of salt mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : abinitio ] ( see also * ? ? ? * for cautioning against the 2d results ) . @xcite applied a semi - analytic model to determine the onset times of the explosions , using neutrino luminosities from 1d calculations of accreting pnss , and estimated explosion properties by analytic arguments .",
    "@xcite also performed 2d simulations and suggested analytic approximations for describing diffusion and accretion components of the neutrino luminosities from pnss and a free - fall treatment for the collapse of the overlying stellar layers .",
    "@xcite invented a method they named `` push '' , which they applied to trigger explosions artificially in their general relativistic , 1d hydrodynamic core - collapse and pns formation modeling with sophisticated neutrino transport .",
    "push gradually switches on and off additional neutrino heating of chosen strength during a chosen period of time .",
    "this procedure is assumed to mimic the effects of multi - d hydrodynamics in the postshock region .",
    "the extra heating is coupled to the _ heavy - lepton neutrino _",
    "emission from the pns .",
    "all of these recipes contain larger sets of parameters and degrees of freedom , which are either varied in exploring different cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or are adjusted by comparison to more complete models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or by reproducing observational benchmarks like those set by sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "the models of @xcite and those in the present paper assume that the explosion trigger is tightly coupled to the physics that reflects the main differences between different progenitor stars , namely to the post - bounce accretion history of the collapsing stellar core and the corresponding accretion luminosities of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it will have to be seen whether this important aspect of the models remains being supported by future developments towards a more complete understanding of the physics of the central engine that powers the explosion in the context of the neutrino - driven mechanism .",
    "1.0pt      the analytic ns - core model introduced by @xcite in combination with their approximate transport solver for treating the accretion component of the neutrino luminosity as well as neutrino cooling and heating between pns and shock , is an attempt to realize the tight coupling of accretion behavior and explodability in close similarity to what is found in current 2d simulations ( e.g. those of * ? ? ?",

    "since 1d models with elaborate neutrino physics and a fully self - consistent calculation of pns cooling miss the critical condition for explosions by far , it is _ not the goal _ of @xcite to closely reproduce the neutrino emission properties of such more sophisticated calculations . rather than that it is the goal to approximate the _ combined effects of neutrino heating and multi - dimensional postshock hydrodynamics _ by a simple and computationally efficient neutrino source model , which allows for the fast processing of large progenitor sets including the long - time evolution of the sn explosion to determine also the shock breakout and fallback evolution .",
    "free parameters in the ns core model and the prescribed contraction behavior of the inner grid boundary are calibrated by matching basic observational features ( explosion energy , @xmath30ni yield , total release of neutrino energy ) of sn  1987a .",
    "this is intended to ensure that the overall properties of the neutrino - source model are anchored on empirical ground .",
    "of course , the setting of the parameter values can not be unambiguous when only a few elements of a single observed sn are used for deriving constraints .",
    "however , the approximate nature of the neutrino source treatment as a whole does not require the perfectly accurate description of each individual model component in order to still contain the essence of the physics of the system like important feedback effects between accretion and outflows and neutrinos , which govern the progenitor - dependent variations of explodability and sn properties .",
    "a reasonable interplay of the different components is more relevant than a most sophisticated representation of any single aspect of the neutrino source model .    in detail",
    ", the basic features of our 1d realization of the neutrino - driven mechanism along the lines of @xcite are the following :    * the possibility of an explosion is coupled closely to the progenitor - dependent strength and evolution of the post - bounce accretion .",
    "this is achieved not only by taking into account the accretion luminosity through the approximate neutrino transport scheme but also through the response of the pns - core to the presence of a hot accretion mantle .",
    "the evolution of the latter is explicitly followed in our hydrodynamic simulations , which track the accumulation of the collapsing stellar matter around the inner pns core .",
    "the existence of the mantle layer enters the analytic core model in terms of the parameter @xmath55 for the mass of this layer and the corresponding accretion rate @xmath56 . * the inner 1.1@xmath8 core of the pns is cut out and replaced by a contracting inner grid boundary and a corresponding boundary condition in our model .",
    "this inner core is considered to be the supranuclear high - density region of the nascent ns , whose detailed physics is still subject to considerable uncertainties .",

    "* ) are set to the same values for all stars .",
    "this makes sense because the supranuclear phase is highly incompressible , for which reason it can be expected that the volume of the core is not largely different during the explosion phase for different pns masses .",

    "neutrino heating can not deposit the explosion energy impulsively , because the ejected matter needs to absorb enough energy from neutrinos to be accelerated outwards .",

    "the inner core of the pns by a contracting inner boundary of the computational mesh introduces a number of free parameters , whose settings allow one to achieve the desired accretion and neutrino - emission behavior as detailed above . on the one hand",

    "while the core - model parameters ( @xmath57 , @xmath47 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) regulate the neutrino - emission evolution of the excised , high - density core of the pns , the prescribed grid - boundary radius , @xmath63 , governs the settling of the hot accretion mantle of the pns . because of partially compensating influences and dependences , not all of these parameters have a sensitive impact on the outcome of our study .",
    "again , more relevant than a highly accurate description of individual components of the modeling is a reasonable reproduction of the overall properties of the accretion and neutrino emission history of the stalled sn shock and mass accumulating pns .",
    "for example , the moderate increase of the mean neutrino energies with time and their regular hierarchy ( @xmath64 ; fig .",

    "our choice is motivated solely by numerical reasons ( because of less stringent time - step constraints ) , but it has no immediate drawbacks for our systematic exploration of explosion conditions in large progenitor sets . since neutrino - energy deposition depends on @xmath65 , the underestimated mean neutrino energies at late times can be compensated by higher neutrino luminosities @xmath66 of the pns core .",
    "the neutrino emission from the pns - core region is parametrized in accordance with basic physics constraints .",
    "this means that the total loss of electron - lepton number is compatible with the typical neutronization of the inner 1.1@xmath8 core , whose release of gravitational binding energy satisfies energy conservation and virial theorem ( see * ? ? ?",
    "correspondingly chosen boundary luminosities therefore ensure a basically realistic deleptonization and cooling evolution of the pns as a whole and of the accretion mantle in particular , where much of the inner - boundary fluxes are absorbed and reprocessed .",
    "again , a proper representation of progenitor - dependent variations requires a reasonable description of the overall system behavior but does not need a very high sophistication of all individual components of the system .",
    "agreement with the constraints from sn  1987a employed in our work ( i.e. , the observed explosion energy , @xmath30ni mass , total neutrino energy loss , and the duration of the neutrino signal ) can be achieved with different sets of values of the pns core - model parameters . using only one observed sn case the parameter set is underconstrained and",
    "the choice of suitable values is ambiguous .",

    "the progenitor of sn  1054 giving birth to the crab remnant is considered to belong to this mass range , more specifically to have been a star with mass around 10@xmath8 @xcite . because of their structural similarities and distinctive differences compared to more massive stars , @xcite call progenitors below roughly 1213@xmath8 `` crab - like '' in contrast to stars above this mass limit , which they term `` sn  1987-like '' .",
    "stars below @xmath010@xmath8 were found to explode easily in self - consistent , sophisticated 1d , 2d and 3d simulations @xcite with low energies ( less than or around @xmath68b ) and little nickel production ( @xmath690.01@xmath8 ) , in agreement with observational properties concluded from detailed analyses of the crab remnant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore consider the results of these state - of - the - art sn models together with the empirical constraints for the crab supernova as important benchmark that should be reproduced by our approximate 1d modeling of neutrino - powered explosions .",
    "the results of @xcite revealed a problem in this respect , because they showed far more energetic explosions of stars in the low - mass domain than expected on grounds of the sophisticated simulations and from observations of crab .",
    "obviously , the neutrino - source calibration used by @xcite is not appropriate to reproduce `` realistic '' explosion conditions in stars with very dilute shells around the iron core .",
    "instead , it leads to an overestimated power of the neutrino - driven wind and therefore overestimated explosion energies .",
    "in particular , the strong and energetic wind is in conflict with the short period of simultaneous postshock accretion and mass ejection after the onset of the explosion in @xmath5010@xmath8 stars . since the mass accretion rate is low and the duration of the accretion phase is limited by the fast shock expansion , the energetic importance of this phase is diminished by the small mass that is channelled through the neutrino - heating layer in convective flows @xcite . in order to account for these features found in the most refined simulations of low - mass stellar explosions , the neutrino - driven wind power of our parametric models has to be reduced .",
    "we realize such a reduction of the wind power by decreasing the parameter @xmath47 , which scales the compression work exerted on the inner ( excised ) core of the pns by the overlying accretion mantle ( cf .",

    "this procedure can directly be motivated by the contraction of the pns found in self - consistent cooling simulations with microphysical high - density equations of state and detailed neutrino transport .",
    "mathematically , the modification of the core radius has a similar effect on the core - neutrino emission as the @xmath47 scaling employed here . while we refer the reader to @xcite for details , we emphasize that the consequences for the overall explosion behavior of the low - mass progenitors is very similar for both the @xmath47 reduction and the core - radius adjustment applied by @xcite .",
    "they lead to considerably lower explosion energies for @xmath67@xmath8 stars and a further drop of the explosion energies below @xmath09.5@xmath8 .    as a drawback of this modification , the explosions of some of the low - mass progenitors between @xmath010.5@xmath8 and @xmath012.5@xmath8 set in rather late ( @xmath701sp.b . ,",

    "this extended accretion phase has only moderate consequences for the estimated remnant masses , because the mass accretion rate of these progenitors reaches a low level of @xmath500.050.1@xmath8s@xmath71 after a few 100ms post bounce , and some or even most of the accreted mass is re - ejected in the neutrino - driven wind .    besides providing information on the explosion energies and the onset times of the explosion ( defined by the time the outgoing shock reaches 500 km ) , fig .",

    "basically , the accretion luminosity , which is given by @xmath159 , does not only depend on the pns mass , @xmath78 , and the mass - accretion rate , @xmath6 , but also on the pns radius , @xmath160 .",
    "one may wonder whether our two - parameter criterion is able to capture the essential physics although we disregard the radius dependence when using @xmath161 as a proxy of the accretion luminosity .",

    "in fact , the separation of exploding and non - exploding models in the @xmath165-@xmath126-plane is even slightly improved compared to the @xmath125-@xmath126-plane , because @xmath162 for most non - exploding models is larger than for the far majority of exploding ones . as a consequence ,",
    "the non - exploding cases tend to be shifted to the left away from the boundary line , whereas most of the exploding cases are shifted to the right , also increasing their distances to the boundary line .",
    "this trend leads to a marginally clearer disentanglement of both model groups near the border between explosion and non - explosion regions .",
    "a subset of the ( anyway few and marginal ) outliers can thus move to the correct side , while very few cases can become new , marginal outliers .",
    "it might therefore even be possible to improve the success rate for the classification of explodability by a corresponding ( minor ) relocation of the boundary curve .",
    "the improvement , however , is not significant enough to justify the introduction of an additional parameter into our two - parameter criterion in the form of @xmath166 , which has the disadvantage of not being based on progenitor properties and whose exact , case - dependent value can not be predicted by simple arguments .",
    "because the line separating exploding and non - exploding models did not change in our test , the criterion advocated in this paper captures the basic physics , within the limitations of the modeling . while we report here this marginal sensitivity of our two - parameter criterion to the ns radius as a result of the present study , a finally conclusive assessment of this question would require to repeat our set of model calculations for different prescriptions of the time - dependent contraction of the inner boundary of our computational grid .",
    "the chosen functional behavior of this boundary movement with time determines how the proto - neutron star contraction proceeds during the crucial phase of shock revival . in order to avoid overly severe numerical time - step constraints , which can become a serious handicap for our long - time simulations with explicit neutrino transport over typically 20 seconds , we follow @xcite in using a relatively slow contraction of the inner grid boundary",
    ". it would be highly desirable to perform model calculations also for faster boundary contractions , which is our plan for future work . in view of this caveat the arguments and test results discussed in this section should still be taken with a grain of salt .    on grounds of the discussion of our results in the @xmath125-@xmath126-plane one",

    "instead , we could safely ignore such a dependence when we coined our ansatz that @xmath167 .",
    "there are two reasons for that . on the one hand ,",
    "the separation line in the @xmath5-@xmath4 plane is fairly flat .",
    "a variation of the ns radius corresponds to a horizontal shift of the location of data points in the @xmath125-@xmath126 plane .",
    "however , with the contraction behavior of the neutron stars obtained in our simulations , only for ( relatively few ) points in the very close vicinity of the separation curve such a horizontal shift is sufficiently big to potentially have an influence on whether the models are classified as non - exploding or exploding . on the other hand",
    ", the models near the separation line typically blow up fairly late ( @xmath168s ) , and the ns masses lie in a rather narrow range between roughly 1.4@xmath8 and 1.6@xmath8 for the gravitational mass ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : properties ] ) . for such conditions",
    "the variation of the ns radius is of secondary importance ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "low - mass progenitors with less massive nss , whose radius ( at the same time ) can be somewhat larger ( fig .  3 in @xcite ) , however , are located towards the lower left corner of the @xmath125-@xmath126 plane and therefore far away from the separation curve ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : progproperties ] and [ fig : properties ] ) .",
    "an incorrect horizontal placement of these cases ( due to the omission of the dependence of the neutrino luminosity on the ns radius ) does not have any relevance for the classification of these models .",
    "our result of a complex pattern of ns and bh forming cases as function of progenitor mass was previously found by @xcite , too , and was confirmed by @xcite . aside from differences in details depending on the use of different progenitor sets and different sn  1987a calibration models , the main differences of the results presented here compared to those of @xcite are lower explosion energies for progenitors with @xmath169 ( see discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : calibration ] ) and lower fallback masses as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sec : systematics ] . based on simple arguments ( which",
    ", however , can not account for the complex dynamics of fallback ) , @xcite already expected ( in particular for their parameterization ( a ) ) that cases with significant fallback in the sense that the remnant masses are significantly affected should be rare for solar - metallicity progenitors .",
    "our results confirm this expectation , although the zams masses with significant fallback are different and less numerous than in the work by @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by these authors , fallback has potentially important consequences for the remnant mass distribution , and the observed ns and bh masses seem to favor little fallback for the majority of sne .    as discussed in detail by @xcite , our explosion models ( as well as parameterization ( a ) of @xcite )",

    "the modeling approach by @xcite seems to yield neutrino - driven winds that are considerably stronger , especially in cases of low - mass sn progenitors , than those obtained in the simulations of @xcite and , in particular , than those found in current , fully self - consistent sn and pns cooling models , whose behavior we attempt to reproduce better by the crab - motivated recalibration of the low - mass explosions used in the present work .",
    "moreover , for the @xmath30ni-@xmath38 correlation reported by @xcite , a mass interval between @xmath014@xmath8 and @xmath015@xmath8 with very low explosion energies and very low ni production , which does not exist in our models , also plays an important role .",

    "a possible reason for this discrepancy could be the consideration of `` diagnostic '' energies by @xcite at model dependent final times of their simulations instead of asymptotic explosion energies at infinity , whose determination requires seconds of calculation and the inclusion of the binding energy of the outer progenitor shells ( see fig .

    "sec : progenitors ] ) .    because 1d simulations can not properly reproduce the period of continued accretion and simultaneous outflow that characterizes the early expansion of the revived shock in multi - dimensional simulations and delivers the explosion energy , our 1d models exhibit an extended episode of accretion that is followed by a strong early wind phase .",

    "[ fig : cartoon ] , [ fig : criterion ] , [ fig : properties ] ) .    the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 therefore span a plane in which successful explosions and failures with bh formation are clearly separated .",
    "the progenitor stars populate an astonishingly narrow band that stretches from the lower left corner with the lightest stars to the upper right direction of the @xmath125-@xmath126-plane , where the massive progenitors with the biggest iron cores and highest binding energies of overlying material are located ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : progproperties ] ) . while sne can be found in the region of low values of @xmath126 , i.e. , for low mass - accretion rate , the non - exploding cases inhabit the domain of high @xmath126 , but the limiting value of the mass - accretion rate that prevents the success of the neutrino - driven mechanism grows with the value of @xmath125 .",
    "both sectors in the @xmath125-@xmath126 plane are separated by a boundary line that can be well represented by a linear function @xmath147 ( eq .  [ eq : sepcurve ] ) with increasing slope .",
    "( the values of the dimensionless coefficients of this linear relation are listed for all calibration models in table  [ table : separation ] . ) because of the physical meaning of the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 , there is a close correspondence between the separation line @xmath147 and the critical threshold luminosity @xmath77 that has to be exceeded to trigger runaway expansion of the accretion shock by neutrino heating .",
    "the rising slope of the separation curve in this context means that for each value of the neutrino luminosity , respectively @xmath125 , there is an upper limit of the mass accretion rate , respectively @xmath126 , up to which neutrino - driven explosions are possible , and that this bh - formation threshold value of @xmath126 grows with @xmath125 .",
    "the parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 , computed from the progenitor profiles before collapse , allow one to judge whether a considered star is able to overcome the threshold neutrino luminosity for an explosion , or , in other words , whether its mass accretion rate stays below the critical limit above which the onset of the explosion is prevented .",
    "only @xmath013% of all investigated progenitors do not follow this discrimination scheme in their final fate but lie on the wrong side of the separation curve .",
    "these outliers are characterized by pathologies of their entropy and density profiles that describe the composition - shell structure in the si - o - layers .",
    "such special conditions lead to unusual combinations of mass accretion rate and pns masses .",
    "our two - parameter criterion expressed by the separation line @xmath178 therefore enables one , with a very high significance , to predict the explodability of progenitor stars via the neutrino - driven mechanism by referring to the properties of these stars as captured by the pair of parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "@xcite explore the interesting possibility that the death of massive stars in ns vs.  bh formation may be better captured by a probabilistic description .",
    "the non - monotonic variations of explosion vs.  non - explosion with zams mass or compactness might be interpreted as stochasticity in the explosion behavior . however , by considering the problem in a more appropriate two - parameter space , our two - parameter criterion unmasks these putatively random variations as actually deterministic phenomenon .",
    "@xcite , in contrast , suggest a variety of factors besides zams mass and metallicity , e.g.  rotation , binarity , the strength of magnetic fields , stochastic differences in the pre - collapse structure or even in the explosion mechanism , that might introduce a randomness such that a star of given mass might not form either a ns or a bh but both with a certain probability .",
    "if such a diversity in the stellar destiny depends on a causal process , for example the presence of different amounts of spin , a deterministic description could still apply but would require an extension to a parameter space of more than the two dimensions combined by our current criterion , e.g. , by adding extra dimension(s ) that capture the role of rotation in the explosion mechanism . if , in contrast , truly stochastic effects like turbulent processes or chaotic fluctuations in the progenitor , decide about the stellar fate , a deterministic criterion for explodability would be ruled out and a probabilistic description would be indispensable .",
    "our study has a number of more caveats that need to be addressed .",
    "the understanding of the explosion mechanism(s ) of massive stars is still incomplete , although considerable progress has been achieved in recent years due to the progress in 2d and 3d modeling and in particular also through improvements in the treatment of the crucial neutrino physics and transport in collapsing stellar cores ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . without self - consistent 3d explosion simulations for large sets of progenitor stars being possible",
    "yet , our study refers to a 1d modeling approach , in which not only the neutrino description is approximated in many aspects , but also the explosions have to be triggered artificially .",
    "we employ a boundary condition that replaces the high - density , low - entropy core of the nascent ns as a neutrino source , and we describe the time - dependent behavior of this core and of the coupling between the core and its hot accretion mantle by a simple , analytical model . calibrating the involved free parameters by observational constraints from sn  1987a for the more massive stars and by comparison to results of sophisticated sn models for low - mass progenitors is intended to anchor our simplified description on empirical ground . although the elements of this approximate approach appear qualified to capture the essence of the neutrino - heating mechanism in dependence of the progenitor - specific post - bounce accretion evolution ( cf .",
    "[ sec : methodology ] for details ) , confirmation by fully self - consistent , multi - dimensional sn calculations is ultimately indispensable . it is also evident that our study , which is only concerned with neutrino - driven explosions , can not yield any information about the possibility and implications of other mechanisms to blow up stars , for example magnetorotational explosions of rapidly rotating stellar cores , which might be a consequence of magnetar or bh formation and could be associated with hypernovae and gamma - ray burst sne ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as ultra - luminous sne @xcite .",
    "our study employs pre - collapse models that emerge from 1d stellar evolution calculations of single , non - rotating sn progenitors with prescribed mass - loss histories .",
    "the results of our study naturally depend on the post - bounce accretion properties of the collapsing stars .",
    "the ( iron and low - entropy ) core masses as well as the entropy and density jumps at the composition - shell interfaces play an important role in setting the conditions for the neutrino - heating mechanism , which is obvious from the definition of our parameters @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "it is conceivable that multi - dimensional hydrodynamics could lead to considerable changes of the stellar properties as functions of the progenitor mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that asymmetries and perturbations in the shell - burning layers of the pre - collapse core might have important consequences for the development of sn explosions by the neutrino - driven mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we are hopeful that the basic insights of our study , in particular the existence of a two - parameter criterion for the explodability expressed by a sn - bh separation line @xmath178 in the @xmath125-@xmath126-space and the tight connection between this curve and the critical luminosity condition @xmath77 of the neutrino - driven mechanism possess more general validity .",
    "the explosion properties of the progenitor stars as functions of the zams mass , however , do not only depend ( moderately ) on the considered sn  1987a progenitor models but will probably also change once multi - dimensional stellar evolution effects will be accounted for in the pre - supernova conditions .",
