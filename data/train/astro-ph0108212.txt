    "the formation mode and epoch of spheroids are among the most important unsolved issues in observational cosmology .",
    "these questions involve two possibly distinct aspects : when did the stars in spheroids form ( i.e. their star formation history ) , and when were these stars assembled in a galactic structure that can be classified as a spheroid ?",
    "the bulk of stars in spheroid - dominated ( early - type ) galaxies are believed to be old , at least in clusters @xcite , but the frequency and amount of later star formation activity is still a matter of debate . to discriminate among different formation scenarios ,",
    "it is crucial to determine whether field spheroidal galaxies had more extended star formation histories than their cluster counterparts ( for opposite views see @xcite and @xcite , also compare renzini 1999 vs. gonzles 1993 and trager et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in most studies , early - type galaxies ( ellipticals and s0s ) are treated as one class of objects , due to the general similarity in their colors and their `` vicinity '' along the hubble sequence .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that also remarkably different formation processes have been proposed for ellipticals and lenticulars . in the case of ellipticals ,",
    "the most cited alternatives are formation at high redshift through dissipationless collapse ( the so - called monolithic scenario , e.g. larson 1974 ) , or a merger of disk systems ( in the framework of hierarchical galaxy formation models , e.g. baugh et al .",
    "1996 , kauffmann 1996 ) . concerning the formation of s0 galaxies ,",
    "it is a longstanding issue whether they are `` primordial '' objects ( i.e. they formed as s0s ) , or whether they were converted from spirals which lost their gas supply either by galaxy - galaxy collisions , ram - pressure stripping or gas evaporation in the hot intracluster medium , galactic winds or loss of their gas - rich envelopes @xcite .",
    "a spiral origin for s0 galaxies seemed to be favored by the discovery of large numbers of blue ( presumably spiral ) galaxies in clusters at @xmath2 @xcite , coupled with the abundance of s0s and ellipticals in clusters in the local universe @xcite .",
    "a renewed interest in studying the stellar population ages of ellipticals and s0 galaxies separately arose in recent years , when the high spatial resolution imaging achieved with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) uncovered a strong _ morphological _ evolution taking place in rich clusters during the last few gyrs .",
    "there is an overabundance of spirals in cluster cores at z=0.5 and the s0 galaxies are proportionally ( a factor 2 to 3 ) _ less _ abundant than in nearby clusters , while the fraction of ellipticals at z=0.5 is the same or larger than at z=0 @xcite .",
    "the progression of this morphological evolution between z=0.5 and now has been recently clarified by @xcite , who explored for the first time the intermediate - redshift range z=0.1 - 0.25 .",
    "these results strongly suggest that a large number of cluster spirals observed in distant clusters have evolved into the s0s that dominate rich clusters today ( see also kodama and smail 2001 ) .",
    "observationally , the existence of systematic differences between the ages of stellar populations in ellipticals and lenticulars is still controversial .",
    "neither photometry nor spectroscopy of early - type galaxies in high - redshift clusters has been able to reveal any statistically significant difference @xcite , and the same is true for other works on lower redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "however , other studies have found evidence for young and intermediate age stellar populations in a significant fraction of lenticulars @xcite .",
    "recently , two studies have uncovered a difference in the recent star formation histories of cluster s0 and elliptical galaxies .",
    "a high - quality line strength analysis has shown that most of the ( faint ) lenticular galaxies in the fornax cluster have lower luminosity - weighted ages than the ( brighter ) ellipticals @xcite . in abell 2218 at z=0.17 , high - precision optical and near - ir photometry has found that ellipticals at all magnitudes and luminous s0s are old and coeval , while the faintest s0s appear to have younger luminosity - weighted ages @xcite .",
    "both of these studies find that the differences between es and s0s mostly stand out at faint magnitudes .",
    "the luminosity range explored by the different studies could be the key to understanding the reason for the apparently contrasting results found so far @xcite , but the relative role played by mass and morphology ( s0 vs e ) in driving the evolutionary history of cluster early - type galaxies is still unclear @xcite .",
    "the central issue is whether recent star formation in a significant fraction of the lenticulars is a widespread phenomenon in clusters .",
    "additionally , it would be important to conclusively understand if and , eventually , why this effect is evident only in a certain luminosity range .    to address these questions we present here a study of the spectroscopically - determined ages and metallicities of ellipticals and lenticulars in what is considered the local prototype of rich clusters , the coma cluster .",
    "our sample comprises 52 galaxies ( 19 ellipticals and 33 s0s ) covering a broad range in luminosity ( @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) .",
    "we will show that the populations of s0s and es differ for the presence / lack of recent star formation activity in a significant fraction of these galaxies .",
    "we also discuss the luminosity dependence of these findings and its possible origin .",
    "this work is based on the spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the coma cluster presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) . multi - fiber spectra with a resolution 69 @xmath5 and a signal - to - noise @xmath6 were obtained for a random subset of galaxies from the sample of @xcite in two areas of @xmath7 mpc towards the center and the south - west region of the cluster . a full description of the sample selection , the observations and data reduction can be found in paper ii , where it is shown that this is essentially a magnitude limited sample with no significant bias .    in this paper",
    "we present the stellar population properties of the elliptical ( e ) and s0 galaxies .",
    "morphological classifications from @xcite are available for 77 galaxies in the mobasher et al .",
    "sample , of which 19 are es and 33 are s0s .",
    "all except two of these galaxies are in the magnitude range @xmath8 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "intermediate types such as e / s0 and s0/e ( 2 galaxies ) and sb0s ( 3 galaxies ) have been excluded from the present analysis .",
    "dressler classified as s0s those galaxies with a clearly recognizable non - spheroidal ( disk or lens ) component .",
    "when viewed face - on , they display an intensity discontinuity between the bulge and the disk . galaxies with a smooth radial profile , with no intensity discontinuities , were classified as ellipticals .",
    "disk galaxies with a clear spiral or outer ring pattern were classified as spirals .",
    "line indices of the lick / ids system and emission line equivalent widths were measured from the spectra and compared with spectrophotometric models to derive luminosity weighted ages and metallicities as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper iii ) .",
    "the line indices used in this paper , as well as those of the whole spectroscopic sample , will be published in a later paper of the series .",
    "great care was taken to ensure an accurate calibration onto the lick / ids line index system , correcting for the spectral resolution , the galaxy velocity dispersion and any residual offset .",
    "the comparison with standard lick stars yields an uncertainty of @xmath9 @xmath5 in our calibration of the @xmath10 index ( see paper iii ) .",
    "as we will show below , this is significantly smaller than the random errors on our @xmath10 measurements , hence the latter dominate the age uncertainty .",
    "emission - line spectra were excluded from the analysis of the lick indices , and no emission correction was applied to the index measurements .    to derive the stellar population properties , we have used the padova version of worthey s models ( see paper iii ) , which includes an accurate treatment of the horizontal branch of low metallicity stars .",
    "the main differences between the padova and the standard worthey models in the @xmath10-@xmath11 diagram that is employed below can be summarized as follows : a ) the standard version does not cover the range [ fe / h]@xmath12 for ages @xmath13 gyr , and b ) the @xmath10 strengths at ages 5 - 12 gyr are generally lower in the padova version , translating into age differences of typically 2 gyr . at ages",
    "less than 4 gyr , the difference is @xmath14 gyr .",
    "we note that , while _ absolute ages are highly uncertain in this type of models , _ relative ages are much less affected by the model uncertainties .",
    "the current sample mostly consists of intermediate - luminosity galaxies , which do not display a high [ mg / fe ] ratio as more luminous ellipticals do ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also paper iii ) , therefore no attempt has been made to vary the abundance ratios of the models . _ _",
    "we point out that : a ) the spectra refer to the central 2.7 arcsec ( 1.3 kpc ) of each galaxy , hence recent star formation episodes in the outer regions would not be detected ; b ) the quantities derived from the spectra are _ luminosity weighted ages and metallicities .",
    "other quantities of interest  such as for example the mass fraction involved in the latest star formation episode ",
    "remain unknown ; c ) absolute ages / metallicities are much more uncertain than relative ages / metallicities , due to the uncertainties intrinsic to the models .",
    "we assume a distance modulus to coma of 35.16 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) . _",
    "the main result is presented in fig .  1 , showing the @xmath10 versus @xmath11 diagram of ellipticals ( empty symbols ) and s0 galaxies ( filled symbols ) .",
    "the spectrum of one s0 galaxy in our sample has very strong emission lines indicative of a current starburst and has been excluded from this and the following plots .",
    "there is a striking difference between the populations of ellipticals and s0s .",
    "all but one of the ellipticals are consistent within the errors with ages @xmath17 gyr .",
    "in contrast , 13 out of 32 s0 galaxies have luminosity weighted ages smaller than 5 gyr .",
    "gyr at @xmath18  is classified as a `` k+a '' galaxy ( =  e+a  ) according to the morphs classification scheme by @xcite .",
    "another 3 s0s with luminosity - weighted ages less than 5 gyrs were classified as k / k+a s ( marginal k+a cases ) .",
    "there is an excellent agreement between the morphs classification and the results based on the lick indices for the strongest balmer line cases .",
    "as expected , the morphs classification is able to identify those galaxies with luminosity - weighted ages @xmath19 gyr regardless of metallicity but  due to the line strength thresholds adopted  it is insensitive to older episodes of star formation which , instead , can be still detected in the lick system . ] hence , more than 40% of the s0s appear to have experienced star formation at a recent epoch , while such widespread recent activity is absent in the elliptical population .",
    "these results are corroborated by the analysis of the @xmath20 ",
    "@xmath21fe@xmath22 diagram that provides a similar but independent method of deriving ages and metallicities .",
    "gyr or less ) in 3 galaxies with absorption - line spectra .",
    "there is only 1 discrepant case of a galaxy in which we detect a recent activity not reported in their work , and another case where the results agree within the errors . ]",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "1 shows that the metallicity range covered by this sample is quite wide , typically from [ fe / h]=-0.7 to 0.4 , i.e. abundances from 0.2 to 2.5 times solar .",
    "a metallicity spread is expected , given the broad magnitude range explored and the existence of a correlation between mean metallicity and galaxy luminosity .",
    "ellipticals and s0s follow a broadly similar metallicity - luminosity relation , as shown in the top panel of fig .  2",
    ". however , the relation for the ellipticals ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) is slightly flatter and less scattered than the relation for the s0s ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "this could explain the finding of @xcite that s0s might have a steeper @xmath11-velocity dispersion relationship than es .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .  2 presents the luminosity - weighted ages as a function of magnitude .",
    "the population of s0s with young luminosity - weighted ages is clearly visible in the region of the plot below the dotted line .",
    "only 4 out of the 13 s0 galaxies with luminosity weighted ages @xmath27 gyr are brighter than @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . in general , the luminosity distributions of es and s0s are different , with the s0 distribution being more skewed towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "in fact , the e : s0 number ratio changes from 5:6 at @xmath30 to 9:12 at @xmath31 and 5:13 at @xmath32 .",
    "it is therefore important to assess how luminosity effects come into play .",
    "this is better exemplified in fig .  3 , where the age distributions of es and s0s are shown for the whole samples , and for galaxies brighter and fainter than @xmath28 ( @xmath33 ) separately .",
    "the total age distributions of lenticulars and ellipticals differ significantly ( with a 93.3% probability according to a kolmogorov - smirnov test ) .",
    "a higher proportion of `` young '' s0s in the faint subsample compared to the bright subsample is clearly visible in the middle panel of fig .  3 , and the difference between the age distributions of es and s0s is more conspicuous at faint magnitudes .",
    "this luminosity dependence of the evolutionary histories of s0 galaxies is naturally explained if a fraction of the s0s were previously star - forming spiral galaxies .",
    "we computed the luminosity evolution of a galaxy whose star formation was truncated at some time between 2 and 5 gyr ago . for galaxies with a star formation history ( prior to truncation ) typical of sa , sb , sc and sd galaxies @xcite , we find that the b - band luminosity fades by 0.5  1.5 magnitudes , depending on the truncation epoch and galaxy type . in the event of a starburst prior to the truncation , the luminosity evolution would be greater .",
    "cluster spirals at intermediate redshift have @xmath34 @xcite in the cosmology adopted here , thus even in the most conservative scenario ( only truncation , no starburst , b - v=0.4 ) for a very late - type spiral , @xmath35 for an early - type galaxy . ] , the passive descendants of spirals are expected to be typically fainter than @xmath36 , corresponding to @xmath37 in our coma sample .",
    "consequently , the great majority of galaxies that evolved from the spiral into the s0 class should not be found at the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "the luminous side of the s0 luminosity function could be filled up by another population of s0s which did not evolve from spirals ( or evolved from brighter spirals at higher redshifts ) .",
    "if the morphological transformation spiral @xmath38 s0 is accompanied by a conversion of a star - forming galaxy into a passive one , it is not surprising that those s0s with signs of recent star formation are preferentially lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "this could be the reason why many previous studies  concentrating primarily on the most luminous galaxies  have not found significant differences between the evolutionary histories of s0 and elliptical galaxies .",
    "a question of great importance is whether it is _ mass _ , _ morphology _ , or _ environment _ that plays the dominant role in determining the evolutionary history of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the results presented here indicate that the distinction between an s0 and an elliptical ( i.e. the presence of a disk / lens according to dressler s classification ) is able to separate classes of galaxies with different star formation histories .",
    "these differences are noticeable between e and s0 galaxies _ of similar luminosity_. hence , morphology appears to be the galactic property better correlated with the presence of recent episodes of star formation , at least in clusters like coma .",
    "however , we have discussed how the differences between s0s and ellipticals can only be appreciated at @xmath39 , and become more and more evident going towards fainter magnitudes . in this respect ,",
    "our findings for the coma cluster are similar to those by @xcite for the fornax cluster and by @xcite for abell 2218 .",
    "as far as galaxy metallicity is concerned , galaxy luminosity ( i.e. mass ) seems to be the primary parameter controlling it ( see paper iii ) .",
    "while the effects of the cluster environment may be a viable mechanism to make spirals evolve into s0s , the existence of field lenticulars clearly proves that this can not be the only mechanism of s0 production .",
    "two ( or more ) formation processes might be at work , of which one could be effective only in clusters and would be responsible for the formation of a fraction of the faint s0s . if this is the case and a large proportion of cluster s0s were spirals at higher redshift as suggested by the hst studies @xcite , then the luminosity function of s0 galaxies in distant clusters could be significantly different from the present - day luminosity function , likely with a lower number ratio of faint to bright s0s at high z. for the same reason , the _ field _ and the _ cluster _ s0 luminosity functions at z=0 would also be expected to differ .",
    "studies of both the luminosity and the age distributions of s0s in different environments would be very valuable in placing constraints on acceptable evolutionary scenarios .    in distant clusters , a large population of post - starburst / post - starforming galaxies in which star formation stopped some time during the previous 1.5 gyr",
    "has long been known to be present ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( morphs collaboration ) and references therein ) .",
    "it has been suggested that these are recently infallen field galaxies whose star formation has been suppressed by the cluster environment .",
    "furthermore , since most of these post - starforming galaxies have spiral morphologies at z=0.5 , it has been proposed that at least some of these spirals are going to evolve into s0s at a later time , and that the timescale for morphological transformation ( from spiral to s0 ) must be _ longer _ than the duration of the observational signature of the cessation of star formation ( 1.5 gyr ) @xcite .",
    "these post - starburst / post - starforming spirals would be an intermediate step between star - forming spirals and passive s0s . in this scenario , the fact that in coma we find a number of s0s with `` recent '' star formation could appear to be at odds with the results found at z=0.5 where the post - starburst / post - starforming galaxies are mostly _",
    "spirals_. this apparent inconsistency is resolved if one considers that the lick system employed here allows an exploration also of luminosity - weighted ages between 2 - 5 gyr , so the times elapsed since the halting of the star formation that we can detect in this work are much longer than the post - starburst timescales which have been identified in distant clusters ( 1.5 - 2 gyr at most ) .",
    "the s0s with recent star formation observed here could be a later evolutionary stage of the post - starburst / post - starforming spirals observed at z=0.5 , but not as advanced as _ passive _ s0s observed in coma and other clusters at z=0 .    finally , it is interesting to examine the distribution in the sky of galaxies of different hubble types and ages ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in our sample the phenomenon of recent star formation in some lenticulars ( filled symbols in the figure )",
    "is _ not _ preferentially observed in the south - west region around ngc 4839 .",
    "this seems to be in contrast with the findings of @xcite , who argued for a higher incidence of galaxies with recent star formation in the south - west area than towards the central region , and proposed that this phenomenon could be mostly related to the ( possibly infalling ) ngc 4839 group .",
    "again , it is possible that the current study is sensitive to a wider luminosity - weighted age range than the studies by caldwell and collaborators , and therefore identifies also star formation episodes that temporally preceded the last activity detected by these authors .",
    "the different epochs of activity could be associated with groups of galaxies in different regions of the cluster .",
    "4 also shows that s0 galaxies with luminosity - weighted ages @xmath27 gyr have an asymmetric distribution with respect to the center of coma , being preferentially located in a region east / north - east of ngc4874 ( identified by the letter `` a '' in fig .  4 ) . instead",
    ", older s0 galaxies and ellipticals ( triangles and circles with a central dot , respectively ) are found to be spread out both north and south of ngc4874 .",
    "this perception by eye of a difference in the spatial distribution of `` young '' and `` old '' s0s is not confirmed by a 2d kolmogorov - smirnov test , which turns out to be inconclusive ( the probability is only 32.8% ) .",
    "clearly , larger samples are needed for reaching statistically significant conclusions .",
    "the possibly higher level of clumpiness of the s0s with recent star formation could be due to the presence of substructure in coma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* who found an apparently bi- or trimodal velocity distribution for coma s0s ) , possibly being related to the ngc4889 merger event .",
    "at least some of the `` young '' s0s in the east / north - east region could be part of the same group , have accreted onto the cluster approximately at the same epoch , and consequently had their star formation halted by the effects of the cluster on similar timescales , as suggested by the fact they have comparable luminosity - weighted ages in fig .",

    "<S> the ages of stellar populations in 52 elliptical and s0 galaxies in the coma cluster are investigated using a new spectroscopic sample . </S>",
    "<S> more than 40% of the s0s are found to have experienced recent star formation in their central regions during the last @xmath0 gyrs , while such activity is absent in the ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies in this sample have absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath1 , and the fraction of s0 galaxies with recent star formation is higher at fainter luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the observed luminosity range of s0 galaxies with signs of recent star formation activity is consistent with them being the descendants of typical star - forming spirals at intermediate redshift whose star formation has been halted as a consequence of the dense environment . </S>"
