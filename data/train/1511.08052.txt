    "uncertainty relations lie undoubtedly at the heart of quantum mechanics , characterizing the indeterministic nature of microscopic phenomena which stem from the incompatibility of simultaneous measurement of two non - commuting observables , as typically exemplified by position and momentum .",
    "soon after the celebrated exposition of heisenberg s tradeoff relation between error and disturbance @xcite , there appeared a revised form called the robertson - kennard ( rk ) inequality @xcite which refers to the relation in standard deviation in independently performed measurements on the two observables . because of its mathematical clarity and universal validity , the latter has now become a standard textbook material .",
    "later , these relations were elaborated from operational viewpoints by taking account of the measurement device , and this has yielded , _",
    "e.g. _ , the arthurs - goodman inequality @xcite and the ozawa inequality @xcite which concerns a mixed relation among error , disturbance and standard deviation . apart from these",
    ", the uncertainty relations on error and disturbance have also been analyzed in quantum estimation theory @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the uncertainty relation between time and energy has to be dealt with quite independently from these , due to the lack of a genuine time operator conjugate to the hamiltonian . for this",
    ", several ingenious frameworks have been proposed , including the one devised by mandelshtam - tamm @xcite and that by helstrom @xcite , where the uncertainty relation is shown to be identified with a quantum version of the cramr - rao inequality @xcite in estimation theory .    in this paper , we present a novel inequality of uncertainty relations for analyzing the error of approximating an observable based on the measurement of another observable through an appropriate choice of proxy functions . since the standard deviation may be regarded as a special case of our approximation error , our inequality can formally be considered as an extension of the rk inequality .",
    "moreover , instead of approximating an observable , we may also choose to estimate a physical parameter pertinent to the observable , so that the time - energy relation can be treated along with the position - momentum relation .",
    "interestingly , in both approximation and estimation , aharonov s weak value @xcite of the concerned observable arises as a key geometric ingredient , deciding the optimal choice for the proxy functions .",
    "we shall also find in the context of parameter estimation that the weak value determines the classical fisher information and turns our inequality into the cramr - rao inequality .",
    "before presenting our uncertainty relation , let us recall the most familiar form of the relations , _",
    "i.e. _ , the robertson - kennard ( rk ) inequality , @xmath0 \\right\\rangle\\,\\right|,\\ ] ] valid for two observables @xmath1 , @xmath2 . here , @xmath3 is the expectation value of @xmath1 under a given ( normalized ) state @xmath4 , @xmath5 = ab - ba$ ] is the commutator , and @xmath6 is the operator seminorm defined for a self - adjoint operator @xmath7 . the rk inequality gives the lower bound for the product of the standard deviation @xmath8 } = \\|x - \\langle x \\rangle\\|$ ] for the two observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "needless to say , the lower bound of the rk inequality takes the state - independent value @xmath9 when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are canonically conjugate to each other , @xmath10 = i\\hbar$ ] .    in place of the standard symmetric treatment of the observables in the rk inequality",
    ", we now consider an asymmetric but more versatile form given by @xmath11 \\right\\rangle\\,\\right|,\\ ] ] valid for arbitrary self - adjoint operator functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 of @xmath2 ( the advantage of this asymmetric treatment will become clear shortly ) .",
    "more explicitly , the operator @xmath12 is defined from a function @xmath14 of @xmath15 through the spectral decomposition , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the basis set of the eigenstates @xmath18 , and the integral in is understood to imply summation when the eigenvalues are discrete .",
    "the operator @xmath13 can be defined analogously from a function @xmath19 . in our discussion ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath19 are assumed real so that both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are self - adjoint , but the definition can be applied to any normal operators using complex functions .",
    "the rk inequality arises from as a special case by letting @xmath20 ( realized by the constant function @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 .",
    "the proof of the inequality goes precisely the same way as that of the rk inequality .",
    "namely , given two self - adjoint operators @xmath7 , @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 by the cauchy - schwarz ( cs ) inequality .",
    "we also have @xmath25/2 +   \\{x , y\\}/2\\rangle |^2 $ ] where @xmath26 , but since @xmath27/2\\rangle$ ] is purely imaginary whereas @xmath28 is real , we obtain @xmath29/2\\rangle |^2 +    |\\langle\\{x , y\\}/2\\rangle |^2 \\geq |\\langle [ x , y]/2\\rangle |^2 $ ] . combining these , and taking the square root of the two sides , we arrive at @xmath30 \\right\\rangle\\,\\right|$ ] .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath23 are arbitrary , we may put @xmath31 and @xmath32 to obtain our inequality .",
    "although our inequality is merely an asymmetric generalization of the rk inequality , the acquired form allows for a novel viewpoint on the uncertainty relation .",
    "specifically , noting that @xmath33 gives a measure for the distance  between the two observables @xmath1 and @xmath12 , we may regard as an inequality giving the lower bound for the distance under the choice of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this will be made more apparent by introducing @xmath34 to rewrite as @xmath35 \\right\\rangle \\right|.\\ ] ] this indicates that the minimal distance between @xmath1 and the family of all self - adjoint operators @xmath12 generated by @xmath2 , or the minimal error in the approximation of @xmath1 from the measurement of @xmath2 in terms of real proxy functions @xmath14 , is dictated by the maximal degree of non - commutativity of @xmath1 with respect to the family of all self - adjoint operators @xmath36 normalized as @xmath37 .",
    "clearly , our inequality will be useful in the operational context in which one measures only @xmath2 and approximates @xmath1 out of the measurement result by choosing the proxy function @xmath12 properly . in this context , the choice @xmath20 , which makes the distance into the standard deviation @xmath38 , is far from the optimal one , having only its expectation value right .",
    "in fact , we shall see shortly that the optimal choice for @xmath14 is provided explicitly by the real part of the weak value @xmath39 which is defined in the quantum process specified by the initial state @xmath40 and the final state @xmath41 ( see ) . under this optimal choice together with @xmath22 , our inequality yields an uncertainty relation stricter than the rk inequality .",
    "the freedom of choice for @xmath19 may further be exploited for considering parameter estimation , that is , for estimating a parameter @xmath42 that specifies the state , as exemplified later by the situation in which the state varies unitarily with the generator @xmath1 . in this context",
    ", the optimal choice for @xmath19 turns out to be given by the imaginary part of the weak value @xmath39 .",
    "in what follows , we assume for simplicity the non - degeneracy of @xmath2 and the condition @xmath43 for all @xmath44 , which can always be ensured if one chooses @xmath2 appropriately with respect to the given state @xmath45 . the primary role of this restriction is to avoid the mathematical elaborations required to introduce the weak value @xmath46 in a completely general manner , so that we may regard it simply as a function @xmath47 from the eigenvalues of the self - adjoint operator @xmath2 to complex numbers .",
    "( in order to lift this restriction , we need to adopt the definition of the weak value being an equivalence class of the family of functions with ambiguity at the singular points @xmath48 , for which our argument below goes through without an essential change . ) here , note also the state - dependence of the weak value @xmath39 .",
    "now , in order to see the statements made above , let us first note the identity , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the operator function defined analogously to with @xmath14 replaced formally by the weak value @xmath39 given in . note that , due to the complex nature of @xmath39 , the operator @xmath51 is not necessarily self - adjoint but rather normal , and that it is dependent on the choice of the state @xmath52 .",
    "then , from we have @xmath53 for any self - adjoint @xmath12 , and thus @xmath54 which specifically leads to @xmath55 for the choice of the constant function @xmath56 . another consequence of is @xmath57     is ` projected ' onto the subspace of normal operators generated by @xmath2 , with the center line representing the space of self - adjoint operators @xmath58 .",
    "the right elaborates the projection onto the space @xmath58 , where now the center line represents the space of constant functions @xmath59 ( more precisely , functions proportional to the identity operator @xmath60 ) including @xmath61 . ,",
    "width=604 ]    these statistical properties on average and correlation suggest that the operator @xmath62 may furnish the optimal proxy function for @xmath1 minimizing the distance @xmath63 . that this is indeed the case",
    "can be confirmed at once from the ` pythagorean identity ' @xmath64 valid for the pair of operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 , whose ` orthogonality ' @xmath67 may be readily confirmed by a straightforward application of .",
    "we thus see that the optimal choice for @xmath12 is made by @xmath68 for which we have @xmath69 as expected @xcite . as for the optimal choice for @xmath36 attaining the maximal value for the commutator in the r.h.s .  of , one readily learns from the equality condition of the cs inequality applied to the identity @xmath70 \\right\\rangle \\right| = \\left|\\left\\langle \\overline{g}(b ) \\mathrm{im}a_{w}(b ) \\right\\rangle \\right|\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that @xmath71 provides the answer .",
    "it is then obvious that these optimal choices , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , realize the equality in .",
    "see figure  [ fig : geometry ] for the intuitive visualisation of the geometric relations among the operators involved .",
    "now , under the optimal choice for @xmath12 , one may put @xmath74 in to obtain @xmath75 \\right\\rangle\\,\\right| .",
    "\\label{ineq : imaginary}\\ ] ] recalling that the rk inequality arises at the non - optimal choice @xmath76 , we see that , apart from the trivial case where the l.h.s .",
    "vanishes , the inequality is tighter than the rk inequality .",
    "it is also evident that reduces to the rk inequality if @xmath77 in which case the covariance , @xmath78   & = { 1\\over 2}\\left\\langle \\{a , b \\ } \\right\\rangle - \\langle a \\rangle\\langle   b   \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\langle \\left(\\mathrm{re } a_{w}(b ) - \\langle a \\rangle\\right )",
    "\\left(b - \\langle b \\rangle\\right ) \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] vanishes identically .",
    "an elementary example to illustrate our point is provided by the 1-qubit system with @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "writing @xmath81 in the bloch sphere representation , one obtains @xmath82 one thus finds that generically ( as long as @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) our inequality gives a tighter relation than the rk inequality .",
    "now , notice that applying the cs inequality to yields another inequality , @xmath85 we then see , from and , that the lower bound is equal to @xmath86 $ ] , and hence is nothing but the classical covariance inequality @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "this should be the case , because the operators appearing in are all generated by @xmath2 and , accordingly , they are simultaneously measurable .    from this observation",
    "we learn that , while the inequality gives a purely quantum lower bound for the product of error in approximating @xmath1 and the standard deviation of @xmath2 , the inequality gives a classical lower bound given by the covariance of the two observables .",
    "these two may be regarded as complementary to each other in view of the fact that , if we sum them after squaring the both , we find the schrdinger inequality @xcite , @xmath88 \\right\\rangle\\,\\right|^{2 }   +   \\left|\\ , { 1 \\over 2 } \\left\\langle \\{a , b\\ } \\right\\rangle- \\left\\langle a \\right\\rangle\\left\\langle b \\right\\rangle\\,\\right|^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a tightened version of the rk inequality .    in passing ,",
    "we observe from the equality condition of the cs inequality and the identity @xmath89 which follows from that the equality in holds if @xmath90 for some real @xmath91 , whereas the equality in holds if @xmath92 for some real @xmath93 .",
    "combining and , and using again , we obtain @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "obviously , when position and momentum are considered for the observables @xmath96 , @xmath97 , the condition reduces to the standard minimal uncertainty condition , in which @xmath98 is related to the parameter characterizing the squeezed coherent states .",
    "returning to the original form , we consider a family of states @xmath99 generated by @xmath1 with a real parameter @xmath42 for a fixed @xmath52 .",
    "suppose that our aim is to find the best function @xmath13 to estimate the parameter @xmath42 around a certain time @xmath100 by looking at the expectation value @xmath101 . in more technical terms",
    ", we wish to find the locally unbiased estimator @xmath13 fulfilling @xmath102 such that the variance @xmath103 $ ] becomes minimal .    at this point",
    ", it is important to recognize from that the optimal value @xmath104 of the minimal ( squared ) error in the approximation of @xmath1 that arises under @xmath72 is nothing but the fisher information associated with the probability density @xmath105 . indeed ,",
    "when the distribution @xmath106 is regarded as the likelihood function for @xmath42 , the corresponding fisher information reads @xmath107 ^ 2 p(b , t ) \\,db   = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 \\| \\mathrm{im } a_{w}(b)\\|^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this prompts us to put @xmath108 in at the optimality and see that our inequality turns into the cramr - rao inequality @xcite , @xmath109   \\geq \\frac{\\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle g(b ) \\rangle\\right)^2}{i(t)},\\ ] ] on account of the identity @xmath110 \\right\\rangle$ ] .",
    "the connection between the uncertainty relation and a quantum counterpart of the cramr - rao inequality has been pointed out earlier in estimation theory @xcite , but here we notice that the precise connection between our uncertainty relation and the classical cramr - rao inequality holds when the optimal choice is made as also mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the optimal choice of the efficient estimator @xmath13 fulfilling and attains the lower bound is now readily given by @xmath111 which is well - defined as long as the fisher information is nonvanishing @xmath112 .",
    "let us specialize to the case where the unitary family of states is given by the time evolution generated by the hamiltonian @xmath113 .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 , which is to be estimated by @xmath13 , is then the time parameter of the evolution .",
    "namely , we are estimating the energy  of the system through @xmath12 and the time  of the system through @xmath13 , both based on the measurement of @xmath2 . plugging @xmath114 and letting @xmath115 in our inequality , and assuming that @xmath13 is a locally unbiased estimator",
    ", we obtain the time - energy uncertainty relation @xmath116 the equality in holds for the optimal choice of @xmath12 and @xmath13 given respectively in and for @xmath117 .    before closing",
    "we note that since the latter condition in is equivalent to @xmath118 \\rangle = i \\hbar$ ] , a locally unbiased estimator @xmath13 is required to be canonically conjugate to @xmath113 in the expectation value at least around @xmath100 .",
    "the existence of such @xmath13 is ensured from with @xmath117 , which implies that an admissible form of such estimators is provided by @xmath119 for a time independent self - adjoint operator @xmath7 with @xmath120 . of course ,",
    "in the actual estimation we know neither @xmath113 nor @xmath121 , but at least we know that there are a host of estimators that meet our requirements .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a novel inequality of uncertainty relations for approximation and/or estimation errors .",
    "the minimal uncertainty is determined by the weak value , and in the context of estimation our inequality reduces to the cramr - rao inequality . since out inequality contains the rk inequality as a special case , it can treat both the position - momentum and the time - energy uncertainty relations in one formula , even though they have to be handled differently .",
    "the appearance of the weak value in the relations is not accidental .",
    "in fact , behind it lies the more fundamental notion of quasi - probability @xcite , whose significance in quantum mechanics should be worth exploring further .",
