    "in particular , it is the case for the motion of tracer particles in turbulent flows @xcite , the diffusion of particles in random media @xcite , human travel behavior and spreading of epidemics @xcite or economic time series in finance @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a great deal of research about superdiffusion .",
    "it includes , in particular , a rather general analysis of the langevin equation with lvy noise ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "besides , it should be noted that the attempt to consider lvy flights in bounded systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and review  @xcite as well ) has introduced the notion of lvy walks being a non - markovian process because of the necessity to bound the walker velocity .",
    "the problems arise because for a lvy walk the second moment @xmath11 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the initial and final point , respectively ) diverges .",
    "previously , we developed an one - dimensional model that generates continuous markovian trajectories , following the lvy statistics , by using simple gaussian but multiplicative noise for the time evolution of the velocity @xcite .",
    "the spatial dynamics naturally follows from this .",

    "the developed model proposes a microscopic implementation of the lvy type processes characterized by an arbitrary small time scale @xmath15 that can be chosen beforehand . when running time exceeds essentially this microscopic time scale , @xmath16 , the corresponding random walks , as should be , are described by the lvy distribution .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is , first , to generalize the developed one - dimensional model to multidimensional case and , second , to obtain the rigorous results using an original singular perturbation technique .",
    "the previous paper @xcite was actually devoted to the formulation of the problem at hand and the qualitative explanation of its main properties using numerical simulation . in the present paper the one - dimensional model",
    "is also analyzed in detail as a specific limit case and the corresponding results just declared previously are obtained in a rigorous way .",
    "the approach to be developed may open in the future a way to treat lvy flights or lvy random walks in inhomogeneous media or systems with boundaries including boundaries of complex geometry .",

    "we expect that the long time dynamics will be described only by a few terms of such expansion .",

    "furthermore , according to the general properties of such random walks the zeroth approximation of the eigenvalue problem   determined by the replacement @xmath44 describes the velocity distribution . in this case",
    "the corresponding quantities @xmath45 are eigenvalues of the fokker - planck operator @xmath46 . in the collection",
    "@xmath47 there is one zero eigenvalue denoted by @xmath48 and the related eigenfunction is the stationary distribution of the velocity @xmath37 .",

    "we obtain the governing equations for the coefficients @xmath50 @xmath51 the quantities @xmath50 except for one matching the eigenvalue @xmath52 originating from @xmath48 decay in time rather fast due to the fact that the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath53 of the zeroth approximation are negative and split from zero by a finite gap .",

    "the purpose of the present work is to demonstrate that the non - analytic behavior of the eigenvalue @xmath52 becomes possible when the second moment of the stationary velocity distribution corresponding to the fokker - planck operator @xmath46 diverges .",
    "it is the statistical properties of the particle velocity @xmath37 that are responsible for the lvy type dynamics of the given particle . so the present section is devoted to their individual analysis .",
    "it should qualitatively explain the results to be obtained below and elucidate the mechanism via which the lvy type process arises .",

    "we need another equation governing the velocity distribution @xmath58 and acting on the initial velocity @xmath59 .",
    "namely , it is the following backward fokker - planck equation of the to type @xmath60\\ ] ] conjugated with the forward fokker - planck equation   of the hnggi - klimontovich type and subjected to the same initial condition   ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "@xmath6 belonging to interval   the first moment of the velocity magnitude @xmath66 converges whereas the second one diverges .",
    "the found expression   for the velocity distribution actually indicates that the particle displacement @xmath67 in the space @xmath2 during some time interval @xmath14 is likely to exhibit also similar power - law distribution typical for the lvy type random processes .      the lvy flights and , partly , the lvy random walks are characterized by mutually independent succeeding steps in the particle displacement .",
    "this subsection analyzing the dynamics of velocity moments illustrates us that the proposed model does exhibit the loss of correlation in the particle velocity on time scales exceeding the value @xmath15 .",
    "thereby the partition of a particle trajectory into segments of duration @xmath68 really can be regarded as a sequence of independent particle jumps .    in order to analyze the time dependence of the velocity moments , equation",

    "equation   demonstrates the fact that the first moment of the velocity @xmath37 remains bounded during the system motion and attains its equilibrium value at the same time scales .",
    "this feature which will be used further in analyzing the spectral properties of equation  . finally , equation   shows us that the system has to get its stationary state on temporal scales actually exceeding the parameter @xmath15 independently of the initial velocity .      previously @xcite we claimed and justified numerically the fact that the lvy type behavior of the analyzed random walks in the 1d case on time scales @xmath16 is caused by the properties of extreme fluctuations in the particle velocity .",
    "namely , an anomalously long displacement of the particle during time interval @xmath3 is approximately determined by its motion during the spike in the velocity fluctuations with the maximal amplitude .",
    "we will substantiate this statement also in the general case comparing the results of the present subsection devoted to maximum statistics of the given random walks and the distribution function of particle spatial displacements to obtained further .",

    "the probability @xmath79 for the particle with initial velocity @xmath80 such that @xmath81 to reach the sphere @xmath82 in the velocity space for the first time at the instant @xmath3 is directly described by the backward fokker - planck equation  ( [ fp4b ] ) . in particular",

    "taking into account that @xmath108 due to the system symmetry we obtain the expression    @xmath109    expression  , first , enables us to estimate the size @xmath110 of the domain @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , inside the domain @xmath102 the inequality @xmath111 has to hold , which allows us to set @xmath112 so the characteristic velocity scale characterizing the first passage time probability and aggregating its time dependence is @xmath113 .",

    "i.e. , @xmath127 the first passage time distribution is given by the expression @xmath128 taking into account the boundary condition  .",
    "so we can write @xmath129 also for @xmath125 .    expressions   and describe the same asymptotic behavior of the function @xmath87 .",
    "thereby we can `` glue '' them together , obtaining the expression @xmath130 that holds in the limit @xmath114 .",
    "it should be noted that this procedure is the kernel of the singular perturbation technique which will be also used below .",
    "expression   immediately gives us the desired formula for the maximum distribution @xmath131 .",
    "namely , by virtue of , for @xmath132 and @xmath114 we have @xmath133 then restoring the time dependence of the extremum distribution from its laplace transform the asymptotic behavior for @xmath134 we get @xmath135 finalizing the present subsection it is possible to draw the conclusion that for @xmath136 the maximum velocity distribution is described by a certain function @xmath137 with the asymptotics @xmath138 here the velocity scale @xmath113 is given by expression  .",
    "we remind that distribution   describes the magnitude of the velocity maximum attained during time interval @xmath3 . for @xmath139",
    "all the directions of particle motion are equivalent .",
    "so for a multidimensional space , @xmath140 , the probability density of the maximum velocity attained during time interval @xmath3 being equal to @xmath141 is given by the function @xmath142 in 1d space this sphere is degenerated into two points @xmath143 , so the corresponding probability is @xmath144 because of the symmetry of the velocity fluctuations .",
