    "hadron spectroscopy plays a valuable role in particle physics .",
    "it was crucial in validating quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the quark substructure of matter .",
    "it provides a stage for understanding nonperturbative techniques , not only in qcd but elsewhere in physics .",
    "hadron spectra are crucial in separating electroweak physics from strong interaction effects , as in charm and beauty decays .",
    "quarks and leptons _ themselves _ have an intricate level and weak coupling structure for which we have no fundamental understanding .",
    "sharpening spectroscopic techniques may help solve this problem .",
    "i shall present recent spectroscopy contributions from the cleo collaboration based on data at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) utilizing cleo s excellent particle identification and resolution .",
    "separate sections will treat charmonium , charm , beauty , and upsilons .",
    "the cleo detector is described in another contribution to this conference @xcite .",
    "the charmonium spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : charmon ] .",
    "specific topics which will be discussed are : ( 1 ) a new measurement of @xmath0 using @xmath1 decays ; ( 2 ) a study of @xmath1 decays to baryon - antibaryon , @xmath2 , light hadrons , and @xmath3 ; ( 3 ) a remeasurement of @xmath4 ; and ( 4 ) results on @xmath5 decays to non-@xmath6 final states such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and light hadrons .    , @xmath9 . -0.2 in [ fig : charmon],title=\"fig : \" ] -0.3 in    one can compare @xmath10 with @xmath11 in order to derive a value of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the results are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "these values are consistent with and more precise than current world averages @xcite .",
    "decays of @xmath1 to baryon - antibaryon pairs have been measured more precisely @xcite .",
    "results are listed in table [ tab : bbbar ] .",
    ".branching ratios in units of @xmath17 for @xmath1 decays to baryon - antibaryon pairs @xcite . the number of @xmath1 signal events is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "[ tab : bbbar ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -0.3 in    several cleo analyses search for @xmath19 .",
    "the value of @xmath20 also is being re - checked .",
    "two analyses @xcite find no evidence for any light - hadron @xmath21 mode above expectations from continuum production except @xmath22 .",
    "upper limits on the sum of 26 modes imply a bound @xmath23 ( light hadrons ) ] @xmath24 .",
    "the cross sections at 3.77 gev for the most part are consistent with continuum at 3.67 gev , both cleo @xcite and bes @xcite , in searching for enhanced light - hadron modes , find the @xmath25 mode , suppressed in @xmath1 decays , also suppressed in @xmath21 decays with respect to continuum expectations , perhaps as a result of interference between a @xmath26 amplitude and continuum @xcite .",
    "one thus can ascribe no more than a few percent of the total @xmath21 width to the non-@xmath6 decays studied thus far , including @xmath27 for @xmath28 + ( hadrons ) , @xmath27 for @xmath29 , probably @xmath30 for @xmath31 , and at most a couple of percent for light hadrons .",
    "the question of significant non-@xmath6 modes of @xmath21 remains open .",
    "one is trying to understand a possible discrepancy of 12 nb in @xmath32 , or @xmath3320% .",
    "could this call for more careful treatment of radiative corrections ?",
    "a remeasurement of @xmath34 by cleo , preferably through an energy scan , is crucial .",
    "cleo has recently remeasured mass differences and widths of the singly - charmed baryon @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "splittings between the doubly - charged and neutral masses are quite small , in accord with theoretical expectations .",
    "the prediction of heavy quark symmetry that @xmath36 is borne out by the data , in which @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "a search was performed for an energy at which @xmath39 production might be enhanced @xcite .",
    "no such enhancement was found .",
    "upper bounds include @xmath40 ( 95% c.l . ) , where @xmath41 refers to the cross section normalized by @xmath42 production .",
    "events with @xmath43 and events with @xmath44 did not show any evidence of enhanced @xmath39 production just above threshold .",
    "cleo data continue to yield new results on @xmath45 spectroscopy .",
    "new values of @xmath46 = ( 2.39 \\pm 0.02 \\pm 0.07 , 2.03\\pm0.03\\pm0.08,2.39\\pm0.07\\pm0.10)\\%$ ] @xcite imply lower values of @xmath47 , which will be important in updating comparisons with perturbative qcd .",
    "the study of @xmath48 decays @xcite has provided new measurements of e1 transition rates to @xmath49 states .",
    "searches in these data for the forbidden m1 transitions to spin - singlet states of the form @xmath50 have excluded many theoretical models .",
    "the strongest upper limit , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , is @xmath53 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "searches for the lowest @xmath45 spin - singlet , the @xmath54 , using the sequential processes @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite are being conducted .",
    "the direct photon spectrum in @xmath57 decays has been measured using cleo data @xcite and is used to extract the ratio of radiative to purely gluonic decay widths .",
    "the ratios @xmath58 are found to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 is consistent with an earlier cleo value of @xmath63 , and the other two are first measurements .    the transitions @xmath64 have been observed for the first time @xcite .",
    "one looks for @xmath65 in cleo data , consisting of 5.8 million @xmath66 events .",
    "( see fig.[fig : chipipi ] . )",
    "two methods are employed , whereby either both or only one of the transition pions are identified , trading sample cleanliness against statistical power .",
    "the resulting signal event counts are 7 events above 0.6@xmath670.2 background and 17 events above 2.2@xmath670.6 background , repectively .",
    "assuming @xmath68 , both are found equal to @xmath69 kev , which is in satisfactory agreement with theoretical expectations @xcite .",

    "cleo has contributed many recent charmonium , charm , beauty , and @xmath45 spectroscopy results .",
    "the long - sought @xmath71 ( the spin - singlet p - wave ground state of charmonium ) has been identified .",
    "its mass and production rate confirm basic ideas about quark confinement and isospin - violating @xmath72-emission transitions .",
    "the decays of @xmath21 are shedding light on its nature and we look forward to much more data on this state .",
    "a rich cleo program will include much further spectroscopy , such as the study of resonances above thresholds for non - strange and strange charmed meson pair production ; @xmath73 studies ; and the study of @xmath74 light - quark and glueball states .",
