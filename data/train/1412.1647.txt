    "the behavior of a system consisting of charged fermions in a magnetic field had attracted considerable interests in recent years especially in strongly interacting matter , where fundamental constituent - quarks exhibit a host of interesting phenomena@xcite , such as chiral magnetic effect and magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the latter one , which will be the main motivation to the present work , involves the dimensional reduction by the landau orbitals of charged fermions under a magnetic field",
    ". we shall investigate another ( nonrelativistic ) system that shares the same physics , the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of composite bosons-neutral bound pairs made of two oppositely charged fermions in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the underlying theory of strong interaction - quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) possesses chiral symmetry for massless quarks , which is spontaneously broken by a long range order because of the condensation of bound pairs formed by quark and antiquark . as the density of states @xmath0 , with respect to the single quark energy @xmath1 , vanishes at the dirac point @xmath2 ( analog of the fermi surface in a metal ) , a threshold coupling has to be attained for pairing .",
    "the terminology `` magnetic catalysis '' refers to the fact that chiral symmetry is always spontaneously broken at finite magnetic field regardless of the coupling strength@xcite .",
    "the physical reason of this effect is the dimension reduction in the dynamics of fermion pairing in a magnetic field .",
    "the motion of charged particle would be squeezed to a discrete set of landau orbitals and is one - dimensional within each orbital .",
    "the system would thus become @xmath3 dimension when the magnetic field is sufficiently strong than the mass and energy of the fermions , which would be restricted entirely in the lowest landau level ( lll ) only .",
    "consequently , the density of states at the dirac point becomes a nonzero constant proportional to the magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "such an enhancement would make the chiral condensate happen regardless of the interaction strength , the magnetic field thus plays a role as the catalysis .",
    "this is quite similar to the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory of superconductivity , where a nonzero density of states at the fermi surface supports cooper pairing with an arbitrarily weak attraction .",
    "it would be natural to expect a higher transition temperature from the chiral broken phase to the chiral symmetric phase due to magnetic catalysis effect .",
    "this is indeed the case within mean - field approximations of effective model studies , it was found that the chiral phase transition is significantly delayed by a nonzero magnetic field even including the @xmath5 meson contribution@xcite .",
    "the pseudo - critical temperature of chiral restoration was also found to increase linearly with the magnetic field in a quark - meson model using the functional renormalization group equation@xcite .",
    "the recent lattice calculations@xcite , however , provide surprising results that the pseudo - critical temperature of chiral restoration drops considerably for increasing magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the chiral condensate increase with increasing magnetic field at low temperature consistent with magnetic catalysis while it turns out to be monotonously decreasing at high temperature@xcite , which is in apparent conflict with the magnetic catalysis and termed as inverse magnetic catalysis evoking an extensive studies@xcite .",
    "while mean field approximation gives sensible results in certain circumstances , fluctuations can break it down , especially in strong coupling domain or in lower dimensions . as was shown in @xcite in the absence of magnetic field",
    ", a long range order can not survive at a nonzero temperature in the spatial dimensionality two or less because of the fluctuation of its phase .",
    "a long wavelength component of the fluctuation variance goes like @xmath6 with @xmath7 the momentum , which gives rise to infrared divergence of the momentum integration in two and lower dimensions .",
    "the anisotropy introduced by a magnetic field @xmath8 renders the long wavelength fluctuation @xmath9 , with @xmath10 a positive constant between zero and one .",
    "such a distortion of the bosonic spectrum towards dimensionality one ( @xmath11 ) , as a consequence of the dimension reduction of the pairing fermions , would enhance the phase fluctuation .",
    "a preliminary study of the ginzburg - landau theory of the chiral phase transition@xcite reveals the same effect and the ginzburg critical window gets widened in the presence of magnetic field , indicating the enhancement of the long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the bec of bound pairs made of oppositely charged fermions in a magnetic field provides another platform to explore the competition between the enhanced cooper pairing by landau orbitals and the enhanced phase fluctuation by the distortion of the bosonic spectrum .",
    "our system corresponds to the bec limit of the bcs / bec crossover , which has been studied extensively in the absence of magnetic field for nonrelativistic fermions @xcite and relativistic ones @xcite .",
    "we follow the functional integral formulation developed in @xcite and calculate the leading ( gaussian ) correction to the effective action .",
    "a technical simplification in the bec limit is that all summations over landau orbitals involved can be carried out analytically , resulting in an explicit formula of the critical temperature under an aribitrary magnetic field .",
    "we found that the critical temperature for the bec was dramatically affected by the magnetic field exhibiting magnetic catalysis or inverse magnetic catalysis depending on the coupling strength . in the weak coupling domain , where no bound pairs(composite bosons ) exist at zero magnetic field , the magnetic catalysis induces bound pairs and thereby a bec .",
    "the critical temperature increases with increasing magnetic field . in the strong coupling domain , where bound pairs exist without magnetic field ,",
    "an inverse magnetic catalysis was found .",
    "the critical temperature decreases as increasing magnetic field , signaling the enhanced fluctuation in a magnetic field .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we lay out the general formulation and present the mean field approximation . the fluctuations beyond the mean field theory , which is necessary for bec ,",
    "is calculated under the gaussain approximation in section iii .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the bec temperature is investigated in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the conclusions and outlooks .",

    "these terms represents the interactions among the cooper pairs , which becomes significant when their wave functions overlap .",
    "therefore the approximation may deteriorate at the density at which the inter - particle distance @xmath231 becomes comparable to the size of the bound pairs .",
    "we have investigated a system of nonrelativistic bound pairs made of oppositely charged fermions in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we found that the variation of the bec temperature with respect to the magnetic field depends on the coupling strength of pairing . in strong coupling domain where the bound pairs(composite bosons ) exist already without magnetic field",
    ", we found the inverse magnetic catalysis that the condensation temperature decreases as increasing magnetic field . in weak coupling domain where the bound pairs are induced by magnetic field",
    ", the transition temperature exhibits the usual magnetic catalysis effect . in either domain ,",
    "the condensation temperature is lower than that of an ideal bose gas of the same mass , @xmath230 , in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the suppression effect is maximized when the lowest landau level approximation works which requires the ratio of binding energy relative to the lowest landau level over the spacing between adjacent landau levels , @xmath232 .",
    "this condition is realized in the weak coupling domain under a weak magnetic field .",
    "otherwise , the ratio is order @xmath233 and the suppression effect is less pronounced . in particular , the binding energy diverges like @xmath234 in the strong field limit , for both strong and weak couplings , making the ratio 0.303 with the suppression factor @xmath212 .",
    "of course , the bec approximation requires the fermion density of the system to be sufficiently low such that the bound pairs do not overlap . with increasing density ,",
    "individual bound pairs lose their identities and bcs condensation emerges . the fluctuations beyond gaussina approximation may also come to play then .",
    "this crossover within the weak coupling domain under a magnetic field is what we called the magnetic field induced bcs / bec crossover . without the magnetic field , the weak coupling domain corresponds only to the bcs side of the crossover .    to simplify the calculation",
    ", we ignored the spin degrees of freedom of the fermions as they do not contribute to the pairing dynamics .",
    "the contribution of bound pairs with different spin configurations to the total density are weighted by the bose - einstein distribution function with different zeeman energies .",
    "for the temperature much lower than the zeeman energy of a fermion , the density is dominated by the pairing channel with the lowest zeeman energy and our previous results can be carried over .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize our analysis to the relativistic fermions with the nonrelativistic propagators , @xmath235 in ( [ propagator ] ) replaced by dirac propagators .",
    "the corresponding one loop diagram underlying @xmath236 will be quadratically divergent .",
    "the leading divergence can be removed by the coupling constant renormalization like ( [ renorm ] ) , but the logarithmic subleading divergence remains , which requires an explicit uv cutoff @xmath237 of the pairing force .",
    "in addition to the weak coupling limit where the pairing dynamics is dominated by the lowest landau level , the lowest landau level also dominates under an ultra strong magnetic field , @xmath238 .",
    "the bosonic spectrum is expected to be highly anisotropic for @xmath238 with the critical temperature of bec strongly suppressed by the fluctuations .",
    "the relativistic case is current being investigated and the results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the relativistic bcs / bec crossover in a magnetic field was reported in @xcite in the context of a boson - fermion model , where the boson is represented by an independent field with isotropic spectrum to the zeroth order of coupling .",
    "the anisotropic distortion can only occur in higher orders there .",
    "the hamiltonian considered in the present work , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , is at the stage of a toy model and the conclusions are of theoretical values only .",
    "but the physics involved may be relevent to the color - flavor - locked phase or the single flavor planar phase of a dense quark matter in a strong magnetic field@xcite , where the pairing force stems from the non - perturbative qcd interaction .",
