    "foreground removal for detecting the epoch of reionization ( eor ) 21-cm signal is a topic of intense current research @xcite .",
    "foreground avoidance @xcite is an alternate strategy based on the proposal that the foreground contamination is restricted to a wedge in @xmath2 space , and the signal can be estimated from the uncontaminated modes outside the wedge .",
    "point sources dominate the @xmath0 sky at the angular scales @xmath3 @xcite which are relevant for telescopes like the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , low - frequency array ( lofar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the upcoming square kilometre array ( ska ) .",
    "it is difficult to model and subtract the point sources at the periphery of the telescope s field of view .",
    "the difficulties include the fact that the antenna response is highly frequency dependent near the nulls of the primary beam , and the calibration differs from that of the phase center due to ionospheric fluctuations .",
    "point source subtraction is also important for measuring the angular power spectrum of the diffuse galactic synchrotron radiation @xcite which , apart from being an important foreground component for the eor 21-cm signal , is interesting in its own right .",
    "most of the foreground subtraction techniques use the property of smoothness along frequency for the various foreground components .",
    "@xcite found that residual point sources located away from the phase center introduce oscillations along frequency direction .",
    "the oscillation are more rapid if the distance of the source from the phase center increases , and also with increasing baseline .",
    "equivalently , the dominant contribution to the width of the foreground wedge arises from the sources located at the periphery of the field of view @xcite . using gmrt @xcite",
    "have shown that these oscillations can be reduced by tapering the sky response .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite showed that correctly modelling and subtracting the sidelobe foreground contamination is important for detecting the redshifted 21-cm signal .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "have introduced the tapered gridded estimator ( tge ) for estimating the angular power spectrum @xmath1 directly from radio - interferometric visibility data . in this paper",
    "we use simulated @xmath0 gmrt data which incorporates point sources and the diffuse galactic synchrotron radiation to demonstrate that it is possible to suppress the contribution from residual point sources in the sidelobes and the outer parts of the primary beam in estimating @xmath1 using the tge .",
    "noise bias is an important issue for any estimator .",
    "for example , the image based estimator @xcite for @xmath1 and the visibility based estimator @xcite for @xmath4 rely on modelling the noise properties of the data and subtracting out the expected noise bias . however , the actual noise in the observations could have baseline , frequency and time dependent variations which are very difficult to model and there is the risk of residual noise bias being mistaken as the signal .",
    "@xcite have avoided the noise bias by cross - correlating observations made on different days .",
    "another visibility based estimator @xcite individually correlates pairs of visibilities avoiding the self correlation that is responsible for the noise bias .",
    "this , however , is computationally very expensive when the data volume is large . in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated that tge , by construction , estimates the actual noise bias internally from the data and exactly subtracts this out to give an unbiased estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "the entire discussion here is in the context of estimating @xmath1 for the diffuse galactic synchrotron radiation . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the same issues are also relevant for measuring the eor 21-cm power spectrum not considered here .",
    "in section  [ sec : imgproblem ] we discuss the conventional problem in standard imaging techniques .",
    "simulation and data analysis processes are briefly discussed in section  [ simu ] .",
    "section  [ sec : est ] discusses the estimator ( tge ) that we used to suppress the outer region of the primary beam and the results are presented in section  [ result ] . finally , we present summary and conclusion in section  [ sum ] .",
    "the contribution to the signal in radio frequency observations from the outer region of the primary beam and from the sidelobes is generally very small as compared to the inner region of the primary beam . in particular , the expected 21-cm signal , which itself is very faint ,",
    "contributes mainly from the central part of the primary beam , and attenuated to a great extent in the outer region .",
    "only the bright point sources from the outer region , if not accurately removed , may have significant impact on the statistical estimation of the diffuse signal .",
    "thus , it is necessary to remove the effect of point sources from the outer region before estimating the residual power spectrum .",
    "however , we will not be benefitted in terms of signal by including highly attenuated diffuse emission from the outer region .",
    "imaging a large enough region to model and subtract all the point sources before dealing with the diffuse emission may seems to be a direct solution of the above problem .",
    "but , in reality there are many issues which make this approach impractical .",
    "first of all , the field of view at low radio frequencies is large , and making larger images is computationally more expensive .",
    "in addition to that , non - coplaner nature of the baselines prevents us from making wide - field image without considering the effect of the `` w - term '' .",
    "there are algorithms e.g. faceting @xcite , w - projection @xcite , wb - a projection @xcite etc . to tackle this problem partly for radio interferometric observations .",
    "however , these algorithms still require significant computation to make an image of such a large region of the sky .",
    "secondly , the number of bright point sources is quite large at low frequency . while imaging a very large region , selecting cleaning region around each source is a tedious job . on the other hand ,",
    "cleaning without selecting regions removes a non - negligible part of the diffuse signal of our interest ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the next challenge is to accurately characterize the time and frequency dependence of the wide - field primary beam for effective point source subtraction from the periphery of the telescope s field of view ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "both the frequency dependence and the deviation from circular symmetry are more prominent at the outer part of the primary beam .",
    "these , along with the rotation of primary beam on the sky , cause a strong time and frequency variation of the primary beam for point sources in the outer region .",
    "they create problem in accurately model the point sources that we want to subtract from the data .",
    "in fact , some of the variations are intractable in nature and it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to make accurate modelling and subtraction of the point sources from the outer part of the primary beam .    though we have not considered instrumental gains and ionospheric effects in this study , in real life any directional dependence of these quantities will also severely limit our ability to subtract point sources accurately from a large region . one can overcome this difficulty to some extent by going into complicated and messy procedure of direction dependent calibration ( e.g. peeling ) @xcite .",
    "again , ( a ) it is computationally more expensive , ( b ) part of the variation may be intractable , and ( c ) there is hardly any gain in terms of recovering the diffuse signal which is too weak in outer region .",
    "the future generation low frequency telescopes ( e.g. ska ) that will presumably be used to carry out redshifted diffuse h  i observation , will have larger field of view , large bandwidth , longer baseline and higher sensitivity .",
    "hence the above issues will be even more relevant .",
    "moreover , the expected huge data volume from observations with those telescopes will make it more challenging to address these problems by imaging a larger region for subtracting the point sources .",
    "the following two sections outline a technique to overcome these problems by subtracting point sources only from the central region and using the tge to recover the power spectrum of the diffuse emission in a more efficient way .",
    "the details of the simulation and data analysis , including point source subtraction , are presented in a companion paper @xcite and we only present a brief discussion here .",
    "our model of the @xmath0 sky has two components , the first being the diffuse galactic synchrotron radiation which is the signal that we want to detect .",
    "we use the measured angular power spectrum @xcite @xmath5 as the input model to generate the brightness temperature fluctuations on the sky . here",
    "@xmath6 is the frequency in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the simulation covers a @xmath11 region of the sky and a @xmath12 bandwidth , centered at @xmath0 , over @xmath13 spectral channels .",
    "the diffuse signal was simulated on a grid of resolution @xmath14 .",
    "the poisson fluctuation of the extragalactic point sources dominates the @xmath15 sky at the angular scales of our interest @xcite , and it is necessary to subtract these or suppress their contribution in order to detect any diffuse component like the galactic synchrotron radiation which we consider here or the redshifted 21-cm cosmological signal which is much fainter and is not considered here .",
    "we use the @xmath16 differential source count measured using gmrt @xcite @xmath17 to generate point sources in the flux range @xmath18 to @xmath19 whose angular positions are randomly distributed within the @xmath20 full width half maxima ( hereafter fwhm ) of the primary beam .",
    "the antenna response falls off beyond the fwhm , and we only include the bright sources ( @xmath21 ) outside the fwhm .",
    "we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 sources in the inner and outer regions respectively , and the sources were assigned a randomly chosen spectral index @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) in the range @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the mock gmrt observations targeted on a arbitrarily selected field located at ra=@xmath28 and dec=@xmath29 .",
    "the gmrt has @xmath30 antennas which for a total @xmath31 of observation with @xmath32 integration time results in @xmath33 baselines @xmath34 with @xmath13 visibilities @xmath35 ( one per frequency channel ) for each baseline .",
    "the resolution of gmrt at @xmath0 is @xmath36 .",
    "the diffuse signal ( eq . [ eq : cl150 ] ) falls off with increasing @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , and we include this contribution for only the small baselines @xmath39 for which the visibility contribution is calculated using a 2 dimensional fourier transform .",
    "we note that the @xmath40 term does not significantly affect the diffuse signal @xcite , however this is very important for correctly imaging and subtracting the point sources .",
    "we have included the point source contribution for all the baselines in the simulation , and the visibilities are calculated by individually summing over each point source and including the @xmath40 term .",
    "we have modelled the gmrt primary beam pattern @xmath41 with the square of a bessel function ( figure [ fig : taper ] ) corresponding to the telescope s @xmath42 diameter circular aperture .",
    "the simulated sky is multiplied with @xmath41 before calculating the visibilities . finally , we add the system noise contribution which is modelled a gaussian random variable with standard deviation @xmath43 for the real and imaginary parts of each visibility .",

    "the residual point sources in the periphery of the telescope s field of view pose a problem for estimating the power spectrum of the diffuse radiation . in this section",
    "we discuss the tapered gridded estimator ( tge ) which is a technique for estimating the angular power spectrum from the visibility data .",
    "this technique suppresses the contribution from the sidelobes and the outer part of the primary beam by tapering the sky response .",
    "@xcite presents a detailed discussion of this estimator , and we only present a brief outline here .",

    "we parametrize @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the fwhm of the telescope s primary beam at the central frequency , and preferably @xmath68 so that @xmath69 cuts off the sky response well before the first null of the primary beam .",
    "we implement the tapering by convolving the measured visibilities with @xmath70 the fourier transform of @xmath69 .",
    "the convolved visibilities are evaluated on a grid in @xmath71 space using @xmath72 where @xmath73 refers to the different grid points and @xmath74 refers to the measured visibilities at baseline @xmath34 .",
    "the gridding significantly reduces the data volume and the computation time required to estimate the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the convolved visibilities are calculated separately for each frequency channel .",
    "then , for the purpose of this work , convolved visibilities for a grid are averaged over all frequencies .",
    "the signal component of the convolved visibility is the fourier transform of the product of a modified primary beam pattern @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xmath77 it is clear that the convolved visibilities respond to the signal from a smaller region of the sky as compared to the measured visibilities .",
    "it may be noted that the tapering is effective only if the window function @xmath78 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c5 ] ) is well sampled by the baseline distribution .",
    "the results of this paper , presented later , indeed justify this assumption for the gmrt .",

    "the visibility correlation ( eq . [ eq : c6 ] ) provides an estimate of @xmath1 except for the additive noise bias .",

    "tapering reduces the sky coverage which , in addition to suppressing the point sources in the periphery of the main lobe and the sidelobes , also affects the diffuse signal .",
    "the reduced sky coverage causes the cosmic variance of the estimated @xmath1 to increase as @xmath49 is reduced ( figure 10 , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> it is important to correctly subtract point sources from radio - interferometric data in order to measure the power spectrum of diffuse radiation like the galactic synchrotron or the epoch of reionization 21-cm signal . </S>",
    "<S> it is computationally very expensive and challenging to image a very large area and accurately subtract all the point sources from the image . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is particularly severe at the sidelobes and the outer parts of the main lobe where the antenna response is highly frequency dependent and the calibration also differs from that of the phase center . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by tapering the sky response . using simulated @xmath0 observations , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that it is possible to suppress the contribution due to point sources from the outer parts by using the tapered gridded estimator to measure the angular power spectrum @xmath1 of the sky signal . </S>",
    "<S> we also show from the simulation that this method can self - consistently compute the noise bias and accurately subtract it to provide an unbiased estimation of @xmath1 .    </S>",
