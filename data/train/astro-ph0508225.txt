    "the source is fairly bright in x  ray with @xmath28 net x  ray counts in the @xmath29 kev band and @xmath30 in the @xmath31 kev band , allowing us to perform x  ray spectroscopy . during the fit",
    ", we use the c statistics ( cash 1979 ; nousek & shue 1989 ) , which has better performance with respect to the @xmath32 analysis , particularly for spectra with low detected counts .",

    "we utilize xspec v11.2 to perform the spectral fitting .",
    "all the spectral fitting was done in the energy band @xmath33 kev and all the statistical errors quoted in this paper are at the 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter .",
    "we first fitted the spectrum with a simple power ",
    "law plus a neutral absorber in the source frame . a galactic neutral hydrogen absorption column of @xmath34 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) was also included .",

    "fit continuum model and the ratio of data to model is shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "both in fig [ spec ] and [ ratio ] , we can see a strong absorption feature at @xmath13 6.3 kev in the observed frame .",
    "the absorption appears to be optically thick , since the ratio of data to model reaches zero at energies around 6.3 kev .",
    "we add an absorption edge to our fit , which attenuates the continuum above @xmath42 with the optical depth @xmath43 = @xmath44 .",
    "an absorption edge with @xmath45 kev and @xmath46 significantly improves the fit ( @xmath47 with two extra free parameters , see table 1 ) .",
    "we also tried to model the absorption feature by a saturated absorption line model .",
    "the model @xmath48 of xspec was used by fixing the covering fraction at 0.99 to represent a blank absorption trough .",
    "the fitting is slightly better than the edge model with @xmath49 for two extra free parameters , which are located at @xmath50 kev , and the line width of @xmath51 kev ( both in the observed frame ) .",
    "the line width can also be taken as the equivalent width of the absorption line since the absorption is saturated .",
    "we also perform spectral fits to search for possible other absorption edges / lines at lower energies .",
    "we try different energy entries from 0.5 to 6 kev , but we find that no further absorption edge / line is statistically required ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the x  ray spectrum of cdfs11 was found to be variable with high probability ( @xmath53 , paolillo et al .",
    "however , due to the limited number of x  ray photons over 5 kev , and the fact that the absorption feature is optically thick with black trough , we are unable to study the variability of the absorption itself , based on our data . sometimes , a broad emission line might actually be mimicked by a strong absorption edge at higher energy ( e.g. , reeves , porquet & turner 2004 ) and vice versa , especially in x  ray spectra with low s / n or low energy resolution . to check",
    "if this is the case for cdfs11 , we fit the spectrum with a power law continuum and a broad emission line .",
    "we tried different central values for the line energy from 4 to 6 kev , and found that an emission line can only improve the c statistics by @xmath54 .",
    "this indicates that the absorption feature in cdfs11 ca nt be ascribed to the presence of a broad emission line .",
    "we discuss here the possible origin of the significant broad absorption feature we detected in the x  ray spectrum of cdfs11 with the 1ms @xmath0 acis exposure .",
    "the feature locates at energies @xmath55 kev in the rest frame , with a confidence level of 99.98% according to f  test .",
    "we note that the confidence level given by f  test for an absorption feature might not be accurate ( protassov et al . 2002 ) . here",
    "we re  estimate the confidence level of the absorption feature via a simple approach . in the energy range @xmath56 kev where the absorption feature is located",
    ", we detected a total of 11 photons ( source + background ) , while the continuum model plus background predict 32 photons .",
    "the cumulative poisson probability for such a deviation is @xmath57 .",
    "since the absorption feature was examined over the whole spectral band , which is @xmath33 kev , the probability of detecting such a broad spurious absorption feature randomly in the spectrum is approximately @xmath58 .",
    "this is consistent with the confidence level obtained with the f  test .",
    "we also perform extensive monte carlo simulations to check the confidence level .",
    "first , we simulate @xmath59 artificial spectra based on the best  fitting continuum model .",
    "we then search for spurious absorption lines in the artificial spectra by adding a notch component .",
    "all the three parameters of the notch model ( central energy , width , and covering factor ) are thawed .",
    "we did not fix the covering factor at 0.99 during the simulation because shallower absorption line ( i.e. , with lower covering factor ) can reach comparable significance level at lower energy due to the higher s / n . to ensure an efficient search over the whole band , we perform the search in narrow energy bins ( such as @xmath60 kev , @xmath61 kev , etc ) with width comparable to that of the observed absorption feature , and count the total number of spectra in which we detected spurious absorption line with @xmath62 .",
    "we found only 6 spectra with statistically significant broad ( energy width @xmath63 kev ) spurious absorption lines .",
    "this indicates a confidence level of @xmath64% for the broad absorption feature we detected .",
    "note also that , while fitting the real spectra , we use only 2 free parameters of the notch model , while in the simulation , we use 3 .",
    "we remark that the confidence level would be higher ( @xmath65% ) if we searched for spurious features with @xmath66 for 3 free parameters , instead of @xmath62 for 2 .",
    "we note that there is also weak evidence of the absorption feature in the 370 ks xmm spectrum ( streblyanska et al . 2004 ) of cdfs11 .",
    "the xmm spectrum is significantly steeper ( @xmath67 ) and it was obtained about one year later .",
    "the statistical quality of the xmm spectrum around 6 kev is much lower due to the high background noise and the steeper continuum .",
    "by fitting the chandra and xmm spectra simultaneously , we found an even higher confidence level of 99.997% for the absorption feature , based on f  test .",
    "however , due to the very limited statistical quality , we are unable to use the xmm spectrum independently to constrain the nature and possible time variability of the absorption feature .",
    "we conclude that the confidence level of the absorption line we detected in cdfs11 is @xmath68% . even considering the number of all the cdfs spectra we examined for interesting features ( @xmath69 cdfs spectra have x  ray photons @xmath70 ,",
    "whose quality is high enough to enable the search for broad line features ) , the absorption feature is still significant with a confidence level of @xmath71% .",
    "could such an unusual x  ray feature be due to any instrumental artifact or to some aspect of our analysis ?",
    "we first consider improper background subtraction as a possible origin of the absorption feature .",
    "we check that we obtain consistent results when using background spectra extracted from different regions of the detector .",
    "we also note that the absorption feature is already significant in the spectrum _ without _ background subtraction .",
    "finally , we do not see any bump at @xmath72 kev in the background spectrum either , suggesting that the significance level of the feature is not magnified by background subtraction .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the absorption feature is not related to uncertainties in the background subtraction .    could the absorption feature be an artifact of calibration uncertainty in the acis instrumental response function ?",
    "as far as we know , no such an artifact ( i.e. , an absorption feature at @xmath4 kev ) has been reported .",
    "we examined the spectra of nearby x  ray sources , but we found no evidence of absorption feature at @xmath4 kev among them .",
    "tozzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) presented the x  ray spectra of cdfs sources using updated @xmath0 calibration files ( with ciao3.0.1 and caldb2.26 instead of ciao2.0.1 and caldb2.0 adopted in giacconi et al .",
    "2002 and in this letter ) .",
    "we repeated the fitting using the updated spectrum and obtained consistent results for both the continuum and the absorption feature .",
    "this confirms that the absorption feature is not due to improper data calibration .",
    "note that wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported a puzzling strong emission line at @xmath4 kev in the observed frame in cxo cdfs j033225.3 - 274219 ( cdfs46 ) .",
    "the two unusual features ( the emission feature in cdfs46 , and the absorption feature in cdfs11 reported in this letter ) located at similar energies in the observing frame , could suggest a common origin related to instrumental effects .",
    "however , there are strong evidences against this occurrence : since the total exposure was composed of eleven individual observations with different roll angles , photons from each source fall into different positions on different chips during different observations .",
    "it is unlikely that an unknown instrumental artifact ( if there is any ) would affect photons from all eleven exposures .",
    "furthermore , the two sources are around 9  apart , and fall into different chips during the observations .",
    "we conclude that the similar energy of the two features is just a coincidence .      among the heavy elements , iron is the only one that can produce such a strong absorption feature at high energies . however , the rest  frame energy of the absorption ( @xmath73 kev ) is too high for static iron in the rest frame , since the highest energy transition is the k ",
    "shell edge of h  like ion at 9.28 kev .",
    "therefor we consider two possibilities : either the absorber locates at much lower redshift along the line of sight , or in an relativistic outflow intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "the continuum fitting yields a marginal intrinsic absorption with @xmath74 @xmath7 , which is too small to account for the strong absorption feature at @xmath4 kev .",
    "we ca nt locate other absorption features either in the spectrum at lower energy ( due to relatively lower ionized ions , such as the oviii absorption edge at 0.87 kev ) .",
    "this suggests that the absorber has to be extremely ionized , with almost all abundant elements fully ionized , and the absorption is dominated by h or he  like iron atoms . adopting the photon ionization absorption model @xmath75 ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) to fit the spectrum",
    ", we obtain an ionization parameter  = @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the integrated incident luminosity between 5 ev and 300 kev , @xmath78 is the density of the material and @xmath18 is the distance of the material from the illuminating source ( done et al .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath7 ( table 1 ) .",
    "note the upper limits of @xmath81  and @xmath82 are poorly constrained since the two parameters are degenerate .",
    "assuming @xmath83 , we obtain @xmath84 @xmath7 .",
    "we assume a temperature of @xmath85 k and solar abundance for the absorber .",
    "we note that an intrinsic absorption at the level of @xmath86 @xmath7 ( well within the compton  thick regime ) would strongly attenuate the continuum photons .",
    "however , if the iron in the absorber is a factor of 10 overabundant with respect to the solar value , we obtain @xmath87 @xmath7 .",
    "the absorption feature can also be fitted by a broad saturated absorption line .",
    "the most likely responsible lines are 6.70 fe@xmath88 k@xmath89 ( 6.70 kev ) and/or fe@xmath90 k@xmath89 ( 6.97 kev ) . assuming an average depth of the absorption line @xmath91 , and a factor of 10 overabundant for iron , we obtain @xmath92 @xmath7 .",
    "we point out that for such an absorber , we also expect fe@xmath88 k@xmath93 ( 7.85 kev ) , fe@xmath90 k@xmath93 ( 8.26 kev ) absorption lines , and strong fe@xmath88 ( 8.83 kev ) , fe@xmath90 ( 9.28 kev ) absorption edges .",
    "given the few counts we measure above 7 kev , we ca nt check the existence of these features .",
    "future x  ray missions with higher sensitivity can help us to unveil the nature of the absorber by showing us the spectral properties at energies @xmath94 kev and the absorption profile with higher s / n .",
    "if the absorption is due to foreground absorber , the absorber has to be located at a much lower redshift @xmath95 ( if due to h or he - like iron absorption edges ) or @xmath96 ( if due to h or he - like iron resonant absorption line ) .",
    "the absorber must be extremely ionized with @xmath97 @xmath7 .",
    "note the foreground absorber is unlikely photo ",
    "ionized , otherwise we should have seen the extra photon ionization source , thus it has to be extremely hot with a temperature of @xmath98 k to reach the required ionization stage .",
    "such a high temperature and @xmath82 is very unusual for intervening systems .",
    "the only possible candidate is the hot intra ",
    "cluster medium found in clusters of galaxies ( see rosati , borgani & norman 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "however , for a cluster with @xmath99 k , we expect an x  ray luminosity of @xmath100 erg s@xmath3 ( based on the @xmath101 relation , e.g. lumb et al .",
    "if located at z @xmath95 , such a cluster would be around 300 times brighter than cdfs11 , and its emission would be obviously prominent in the _ chandra _ image .",
    "we conclude that the x  ray absorption feature we detected in cdfs11 ca nt be due to an intervening systems along the line of sight .",
    "finally , we consider a relativistic outflow intrinsic to the quasar , with speed of @xmath102 ( doppler factor @xmath103 for absorption edge ) or @xmath104 ( @xmath105 for absorption line ) , to produce the observed blueshift of the absorption feature .",
    "note that similar blueshifted features have been reported in the x  ray spectra of 3 agns : a highly blueshifted o@xmath106 emission line in pks 0637 - 75 with @xmath107 ( yaqoob et al .",
    "1998 ) ; a blueshifted fe ",
    "k emission line ( @xmath108 ) in qso pks 2149 - 306 ( yaqoob et al . 1999 ) ; and a strong blueshifted fe - k emission line ( @xmath109 ) in cxo cdfs j033225.3 - 274219 ( wang et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the good agreements of the blueshift factors from different sources strongly suggest a close origin of the relativistic outflow , and strengthen the statistical significance of these features .",
    "taking log@xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath7 , we estimate the distance of the absorber from the central source @xmath18 by assuming the thickness of the absorber @xmath112 .",
    "we obtain @xmath113 cm .",
    "following reeves , obrien & ward ( 2003 ) , we estimate the rate of relativistic outflow . the outflow rate ( @xmath114 ) can be calculated as @xmath115 . assuming that the outflow subtends a solid angle of 0.1  steradian",
    ", we obtain a outflow rate of @xmath116 g s@xmath3 or @xmath117  year@xmath3 , similar to that of the outflow in pds 456 ( @xmath118 , reeves et al .",
    "however , because of the extremely high outflow speed in this case , the kinetic energy carried by the relativistic material outflow would be @xmath119  year@xmath3 , and then requires an accretion rate of at least 200 @xmath120  year@xmath3 with an assumed energy production efficiency @xmath121 which entirely goes into the outflow .",
    "such an accretion rate is far beyond the eddington limit even for a supermassive black hole of @xmath122 ( @xmath123  year@xmath3 ) . to keep the rate of kinetic energy outflow lower than that released by eddington accretion",
    ", a more reasonable outflow rate would be at least 100 times smaller ( @xmath124  year@xmath3 ) , and so does the solid angle ( @xmath125 steradian ) .",
    "the extremely high velocity and small covering factor strongly link the physics of the outflow to relativistic jets in agn and x - ray binary systems ( such as the famous xrb ss 433 , see migliari , fender & mndez 2002 ) .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray absorption feature in cdfs11 is due to an ionized jet - like outflow intrinsic to the quasar , with a bulk velocity of @xmath13 0.7 - 0.8 c. similar outflows have been reported in the x - ray spectra of several other agns .",
