    "the skyrme model @xcite is a nonlinear theory of pions which was identified by witten as a low energy effective model of qcd @xcite .",
    "the model has a conserved topological charge that is interpreted as the baryon number @xmath0 , and the minimal energy static solutions for each integer @xmath0 are topological soliton solutions called skyrmions .",
    "no known stable knotted solutions have been found in the classical skyrme model .",
    "this is because , unlike the skyrme - faddeev model @xcite , the model does not possess the necessary structure to stabilise such configurations . here",
    "we investigate how hopf solitons dynamically decay into the vacuum solution .",
    "this analysis requires developing an understanding of the geometry , about a point , of configuration space .",
    "similar analysis has recently been performed for the skyrme model , namely understanding the vibrational modes of the skyrmions which correspond to lithium-7 @xcite and oxygen-16 @xcite .",
    "the format of this paper is as follows : we introduce the skyrme mode .",
    "we then numerically show that the first seven hopf solitons are solutions of skyrme model , but not minimum energy solutions .",
    "next we discuss how the hopf solitons decay into the vacuum solution , where we introduce a matrix - free numerical method to identify the prominent direction of breakup . at the end",
    "we discuss how the hopf solitons emit a cloud of isospinning radiation , followed by a short conclusion .",
    "the skyrme field , @xmath1 , is an @xmath2-valued scalar and can be expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a constraint field , @xmath5 are the three pion fields , @xmath6 are the three pauli matrices and the constraint @xmath7 . here",
    "it is convenient to represent the skyrme field as a four component unit vector @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "the model is lorentz invariant and , in so - called skyrme units , it can be defined by the lagrangian density ,    @xmath10    the static energy functional associated with this lagrangian density is , @xmath11    at fixed time , @xmath12 is a map @xmath13 , where @xmath14 at spatial infinity .",
    "this boundary condition compactifies @xmath15 to @xmath16",
    ". hence , a finite energy configuration @xmath12 extends to a map @xmath17 , and then belongs to a class of @xmath18 and therefore is indexed by an integer @xmath19 , called the baryon number .",
    "@xmath0 is also the degree of the map @xmath12 which can be explicitly calculated as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the baryon density .",
    "static skyrmionsare solutions of the equations of motion , which are derived from variation of energy , @xmath22 .",
    "they are the minimal energy solutions for each value of @xmath0 . in the figuresof skyrmions we plot level - sets of baryon density @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ b1skyrme ] shows a @xmath23 hedgehogskyrmioncoloured as in @xcite .",
    "the centres of the red , green and blue regions are where @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the unseen white region is where @xmath26 ( the boundary ) and the black is where @xmath27 ( centre of the skyrmion ) .",

    "such a map belongs to a homotopy class of @xmath28 .",
    "configurations , plotted as preimages of a point on the target two sphere , in @xmath29 are knotted string - like solitons @xcite .",
    "importantly , if we set @xmath30 in equation , we gain the skyrme - faddeev model ( with a different normalisation , multiplying the solutions in @xcite by @xmath31 yields the energy in the chosen skyrme units ) . in this case",
    "the field @xmath32 maps to an equatorial sub unit 2-sphere @xmath33 .",
    "the skyrme - faddeev minimum energy solutions have been known for a long time @xcite . here",
    "we are interested in hopfion like solutions in the skyrme model .",
    "a skyrmion is a topological soliton , where the image of the map is the entire 3-sphere and the image for a hopfion , in the skyrme - faddeev model , is the 2-sphere . in both cases",
    "the images are not homotopic to a point , and the solitons are stabilised for all continuous deformations . unlike skyrmions , and the conventional hopfions , the hopfions in the skyrme model are not energetic minima in each topological sector .",
    "the image of the field does not cover the entire 3-sphere .",
    "we call this degree quasi - topology and we label the degree of each configuration as @xmath34 . the hopfion - like solutions are called quasi hopfions .",
    "before studying the decay of quasi hopfions in the skyrme model , we need to attain static quasi hopfion solutions in the skyrme model . taken from the skyrme - faddeev model , @xcite , initial conditions for @xmath35",
    "are energetically relaxed on a lattice of @xmath36 with spacing @xmath37 , with derivatives approximated by fourth - order accurate finite differences .",
    "this produces solutions , @xmath38 , which are extrema of the energy functional .",
    "these extrema are found by solving the equations of motion , namely the variation of the energy functional , @xmath22 .     and",
    "colouring is due to the pion fields as in the text.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    all of these solutions are shown in figure [ knots ] , it must be noted that these are not global minima .",
    "this is because they can all be continuously deformed into the vacuum solution , which classically has zero energy .",
    "these solutions are the same as those found in the skyrme - faddeev model @xcite .",
    "the solutions verify that the quasi hopfions are indeed solutions of the skyrme model s equation of motion , stabilised by symmetry .",
    "y.m . cho , b.s . park and p.m. zhang @xcite , used an energetic argument to conjecture that the @xmath39 quasi hopfion would breakup into a skyrmion anti - skyrmion pair ( baryon anti - baryon pair ) .",
    "it is correct that the @xmath39 quasi hopfion , with energy @xmath40 in skyrme units , has more energy than an infinity separated skyrmion anti - skyrmion which as energy @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is not immediately apparent that quasi hopfions would decay in a direction in configuration space , @xmath42 , such that the domain would cover the target space . where the configuration space @xmath42 is defined as ,    @xmath43    another way to understand this is to consider the quasi hopfion configurations as an equatorial two sphere on the 3-sphere .",
    "such a 2-sphere can be continuously shrunk moving on the 3-sphere , until it contracts to the point which represents the vacuum solution .",
    "this homotopy would be such that every preimage has baryon density ( jacobi determinant ) zero , and hence no region of skyrmion or anti - skyrmion .",
    "+ to test how these quasi hopfions break up we first add a small arbitrary periodic perturbation , @xmath44 , to a solution @xmath45 .",
    "this configuration is then normalised such that @xmath46 . using this as an initial condition , in a full time evolution simulation ,",
    "produces the images in figure [ perturbation - arb - q1 ] .",
    "when the skyrmion anti - skyrmion is formed .",
    "the left image show a level set of @xmath47 ( hopfion ) .",
    "the central image show the hopfion and the skyrmion anti - skyrmion in the centre of the quasi hopfion .",
    "the right most image shows the skyrmion and anti - skyrmion in isolation .",
    "all of the colours indicate the pion fields . ]",
    "this simulation flows to a configuration with @xmath48 and then breaks down .",
    "this implies that the quasi hopfion does break up into a skyrmion anti - skyrmion pair , which then annihilate .",
    "also , the colouring in figure [ perturbation - arb - q1 ] show that the skyrmion anti - skyrmion pair cover the entire target 3-sphere .",
    "fundamentally this does not show that the quasi hopfion generically breaks up into a skyrmion anti - skyrmion pair .    to understand how these quasi hopfions decay , we need to understand the directions of greatest reduction in energy about a point in configuration space .",
    "we are interested in critical points in the configuration space which correspond to solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "more particularly , points @xmath38 such that @xmath49 ; namely solutions of the equations of motion of @xmath50 . to find the prominent break - up perturbation @xmath51 we need to find @xmath52 in @xmath42 which is the greatest reduction in energy about @xmath53 . to do this we linearise the energy at @xmath53 as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the hessian of @xmath56 .",
    "we must include at least second order terms because , by the fundamental theorem of calculus , @xmath57 for all @xmath52 .",
    "the usual procedure is to find the smallest eigen - pair of the hessian , @xmath55 . to do this numerically on a lattice of @xmath58 lattice",
    "the hessian matrix would be a @xmath59 million by @xmath59 million matrix .",
    "finding the eigenvalues of such a large ( partially sparse ) matrix is limited by the memory of most computers .",
    "populating such a matrix is also very involved . to proceed we make use of the fact that the second directional derivative of @xmath50 in @xmath52 is @xmath60 .",
    "so finding @xmath52 which minimises @xmath61 will produce the optimal perturbation . to find the @xmath52 which minimises @xmath62 we implemented a gradient flow algorithm , @xmath63 it",
    "should be noted that this procedure is the same as linear stability , where one takes the equations of motion ( first order directional derivative ) , linearises them to give the hessian , @xmath55 , ( second order directional derivative ) .",
    "one can then find the smallest eigenvalue @xmath64 by rearranging the eigenequation to give @xmath65 , which can be minimised by finding the @xmath52 which minimises @xmath66 . as shown previously , this is the same as finding the @xmath52 which minimises @xmath67 .",
    "the main advantage of this method , over the explicit hessian matrix - type approach , is that it does not require an explicit formulation of the hessian matrix , it is known as a matrix - free method .",
    "along with the gradient flow we include the constraints @xmath68 and @xmath69 , these conditions stop @xmath52 from having a large component pointing towards the centre of the target @xmath70 .    performing",
    "this gradient flow indeed showed that the preferred break - up direction is for the quasi hopfion to decay into what seems like a skyrmion anti - skyrmion pair , but aligned differently to the quasi hopfion , as shown in figure [ perturbation - q1 ] .",
    ", for the @xmath39 quasi hopfions .",
    "the left image is of the quasi hopfion , the purple and yellow lumps are positive and negative baryon density respectively .",
    "the central image shows the quasi hopfion and level sets of positive and negative baryon density .",
    "the right images shows level sets of positive and negative level sets of baryon density .",
    "red , blue , green , white and black colouring indicates the pion fields . ]",
    "considering the hessian s eigenequation @xmath71 , it is apparent that @xmath52 and @xmath72 have the same eigenvalue . also , the @xmath39 quasi hopfion is invariant under a combined isorotation , @xmath73 , and spacial rotation , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "so , considering an isorotation and spacial rotation of the eigenequation , we see that @xmath76 .",
    "this gives that @xmath77 , hence @xmath64 is invariant under the combined isorotation and rotation when @xmath75 .",
    "the same analysis can be performed for @xmath78 and is shown in figure [ perturbation - q2 - 7 ] .",
    ", for the @xmath78 quasi hopfions .",
    "purple and yellow lumps are positive and negative baryon density skyrmions respectively . ]",
    "the images in figure [ perturbation - arb - q1 ] of the arbitrary perturbation and in figure [ perturbation - q1 ] of the optimal perturbation are similar . however , if we use the optimal perturbation as an initial condition for a full time simulation , we find that the maximum value for @xmath79 is @xmath80 and not @xmath81 .",
    "the two decays therefore have a subtle difference . to understand the difference we can consider how the image of the quasi hopfion unwraps off the target 3-sphere . to see this ,",
    "we consider the 2-sphere defined by , @xmath82 where @xmath83 and neglect points where @xmath84 .",
    "figure [ opt - pert - q1-target ] shows the points of the perturbed quasi hopfion on this 2-sphere where blue dots denote the points which have zero baryon density , @xmath85 ( zero jacobi determinant ) , and black dots denote the points which have non - zero baryon density , @xmath86 ( jacobi determinant ) .",

    "figure [ opt - pert - q1-target ] clearly shows that under time evolution the quasi hopfion expands to cover one half of the @xmath90-sphere , and then contracts to the vacuum point .",
    "it happens in such a way that the boundary conditions are preserved . also , each black point has nonzero baryon density ( jacobi determinant ) but the sum of the absolute value of the baryon density ( jacobi determinant ) sums to @xmath91 .",
    "figure [ sim - pert - q1-target ] shows the same analysis for the previous arbitrary perturbation , @xmath92 .",
    ", for the @xmath87 quasi hopfions .",
    "points plotted on a sub sphere of the target space , black @xmath88 , blue @xmath89 . at time slices chosen to show the unwrapping.,scaledwidth=88.0% ]",
    "figure [ sim - pert - q1-target ] shows that , for the arbitrary perturbation , the field evolves to cover the entire @xmath90-sphere .",
    "it does this such that the sum of baryon density ( jacobi determinant ) is zero , but the integral of the absolute baryon density equals @xmath81 .",
    "this indicates that the two break ups are distinctly different .",
    "yet taking the inner product of the arbitrary perturbation @xmath92 with the optimal perturbation @xmath52 gives a value of @xmath93 .",
    "this shows that the arbitrary perturbation has a small component in the same direction , in @xmath42 , as the optimal perturbation .",
    "hence , they can be understood as similar perturbations , which propagate in slightly different directions towards the same minimum .",
    "the optimal perturbation is direct , while the arbitrary perturbation passes near to a skyrmion anti - skyrmion configuration .",
    "to relate the @xmath23 skyrmion to the proton or neutron requires including isospin . in the skyrme model isospin acts on the pion fields , and has had some success in modelling nucleon scattering with spinning skyrmions @xcite . to understand the consequence of isospinning quasi hopfions we implemented a full field simulation with a rigidly isospinning quasi hopfion as initial condition , @xmath94 this is analogous to the more common @xmath95 formulation @xmath96 where @xmath97",
    "such an isospin causes the @xmath98 and @xmath99 components to isospin into each other .",
    "using this as an initial condition , with @xmath100 , gives rise a configuration which is stable to perturbation for a long time .",
    "this is shown figure [ iso - q=1 ] .",
    "quasi hopfions.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the isospin , similar to the spherically symmetric @xmath23 skyrmion , also causes a spatial rotation .",
    "this is apparent because the colours twist around the quasi hopfion , so as the colour rotate into each other they cause the ring to spin .",
    "hence , isospin is equivalent to spin .",
    "this produces two angular momenta , one about each circumference of the quasi hopfion .",
    "as the quasi hopfion decays it radiates in the form of kinetic energy , @xmath101 .",
    "this kinetic energy is shown isospinning in figure [ q1-pion - rad ] .",
    "this can not follow the same breakup mode as in the non isospinning case , because the skyrmion and anti - skyrmion would seem to spin in the same direction .",
    "this would cause a large gradient of the field in - between them , and hence a large energetic cost .",

    "in this work we have identified the break up of @xmath35 quasi hopfions , particularly the single @xmath39 quasi hopfion .",
    "we have discovered that the direction of greatest reduction in energy corresponds to the formation of a skyrmion lump anti - skyrmion lump pair .",
    "but there is a higher energy perturbation which gives rise to a skyrmion anti - skyrmion pair .",
    "we have also observed that isospinning quasi hopfions break up in to a cloud of spinning radiation , which can be understood as a cloud of isospinning classical pions .",
    "mainly we have developed a matrix - free approach , based on geometry , that finds the eigenvector of the hessian which corresponds to its minimum eigenvalue .",
    "this is a general technique , which could be applied to other field theories which have nontrivial breakup modes .",
