    "recently the study of thermodynamics of black holes in ads spacetime has been generalized to the extended phase space , in which the cosmological constant is identified as a thermodynamic pressure and its variations are included in the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "such studies are mainly motivated by the geometric derivation of the smarr relation @xcite , in which a term consisting of the pressure and its conjugate `` thermodynamic volume '' appears . once one takes the cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure in the first law , the black hole mass should be explained as enthalpy rather than internal energy of the system . besides",
    ", the criticality associated with the pressure was discussed in the extended phase space @xcite . with the extended structure of the thermodynamic phase space , one can often find phase transitions and critical points of various kinds .",
    "for instance , an interesting phenomena of black hole reentrant phase transition is found recently in four - dimensional born - infeld - ads black hole @xcite , higher dimensional rotating ads black holes @xcite , kerr ads black holes @xcite , gb - ads black hole @xcite and the third order lovelock ads black holes @xcite , which is observed previously in multi - component fluids @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to take other parameters as novel dimensions of the thermodynamic phase space , e.g. the born - infeld parameter in the born - infeld - ads black holes @xcite and the gb parameter in gb - ads black holes @xcite .",
    "the reentrant phase transition includes both first and zeroth order phase transitions .",
    "however , the origin of zeroth order phase transition is still unclear .",
    "this makes it interesting to consider black hole systems containing only the zeroth order phase transition .",
    "the thermodynamics of the ads black holes in conformal gravity @xcite to be studied in this work provides precisely such an example .    on the other hand , although taking the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure is nowadays a common practice , such operations implicitly assume that gravitational theories which differ only in the values of the cosmological constants are considered to fall in the `` same class '' , with unified thermodynamic relations .",
    "the common excuse for doing this is that the classical theory of gravity may be an effective theory which follows from a yet unknown fundamental theory , in which all the presently  physical constants \" are actually moduli parameters that can run from place to place in the moduli space of the fundamental theory . given that the fundamental theory is yet unknown , it is preferable to consider the extended thermodynamics of gravitational theories involving only a single action , which requires that all variables included in the thermodynamical relations must be integration constants .",
    "it so happens that , in conformal gravity , the cosmological constant comes as an integration constant rather than as a bare parameter which appear explicitly in the classical action .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath0 criticality of the static charged ads black hole in conformal gravity .",
    "there exists a single critical temperature , above which there are two zeroth order phase transition points . in the next section ,",
    "we first revisit the thermodynamics of static charged ads black hole in conformal gravity in the extended phase space .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the @xmath0 criticality , particular attention is paid toward the appearance of critical points and the zeroth order phase transitions .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "we consider the static charged ads black hole in conformal gravity .",
    "the action of conformal gravity reads @xmath7 where the unusual sign in front of the maxwell term is inspired by critical gravity @xcite and is required by requiring that the einstein gravity emerges from conformal gravity in the infrared limit @xcite .",
    "the static black hole solution with ads asymptotics for conformal gravity is found in @xcite , which takes the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the corresponding maxwell field .",
    "@xmath11 represents the line element of a @xmath12 maximally symmetric einstein space with constant curvature @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "there are six parameters @xmath16 in the solution , five of which are integration constants , and the last one determines the spacial sectional geometry of the horizon .",
    "these parameters obey a constraint @xmath17 so there are actually only 5 independent parameters ( @xmath18 is to be considered to be determined by other parameters as in ) . except the discrete parameter @xmath19",
    ", the rest 4 parameters @xmath20 are related to conserved charges : electric charge , charge of massive spin-2 hair , enthalpy and pressure , respectively . however , at fixed charges @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 , there still exist a discrete freedom in choosing the integration constant @xmath18 : @xmath23    under the point of view of taking the cosmological constant @xmath22 as a thermodynamic pressure @xmath24 the energy calculated by employing the noether charge associated with the time - like killing vector @xcite should be identified with the enthalpy @xmath25 of the gravitational system .",
    "it reads @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the largest real root of @xmath28 which corresponds to the event horizon black hole , and so there is no cosmological horizon in the solution .",
    "] , @xmath29 is overall coupling which is present in the action . because of the double - valuedness of the integration constant @xmath18",
    ", one immediately sees a double - valued behavior of the enthalpy .",
    "such behaviors are also present in the four dimensional charged rotating black hole @xcite and six dimensional static black holes @xcite of conformal gravity .",
    "one can expect that the temperature and gibbs free energy may also be double - valued .",
    "these double - valued variables must be all considered in order to have a holistic look at the thermodynamics in the extended phase space of the black hole .",
    "the thermodynamical conjugate of the pressure , i.e. the `` thermodynamic volume '' , is given by @xmath30 it can be seen that the sign of @xmath31 is determined by the sign of the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "besides @xmath6 and @xmath31 , all the other thermodynamic quantities are given in @xcite .",
    "the temperature is @xmath33 and its conjugate , i.e. the entropy is @xmath34 the electric charge and the conjugate potential are respectively @xmath35 the parameter @xmath36 is a massive spin-2 hair which is now taken as a novel dimension in the thermodynamic phase space .",
    "we label this novel dimension and its conjugate as @xmath37 : @xmath38 throughout this work , we will take the normalization @xmath39 .",
    "it can be checked that the first law of thermodynamics @xmath40 and the smarr relation @xmath41 hold in the extended thermodynamic phase space @xcite .",
    "the absence of @xmath42 and @xmath43 terms in the smarr relation can be explained by scaling arguments .",
    "the enthalpy can be viewed as a homogeneous function of the extensive variables @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 assuming each extensive variable has a scaling dimension which is denoted @xmath46 respectively . if the enthalpy @xmath25 itself has scaling dimension @xmath47 , then after a rescaling of the extensive variables we get @xmath48 taking the first derivative with respect to @xmath49 and then setting @xmath50 , we get @xmath51 after a little calculation , one can find that @xmath36 scales as [ length]@xmath52 ; @xmath18 scales as [ length]@xmath53 ; @xmath22 scales as [ length]@xmath54 which is the same with @xmath6 ; @xmath32 scales as [ length]@xmath55 ; @xmath56 scales as [ length]@xmath53 , which is the same with @xmath57 ; @xmath58 scales as [ length]@xmath53 ; @xmath25 scales as [ length]@xmath52 ; @xmath32 scales as [ length]@xmath55 , which results in the smarr relation , as expected .",
    "while considering critical behaviors , the gibbs free energy will play an important role .",
    "it is given as follows : @xmath59 on the other hand , the helmholtz free - energy can be obtained from the euclideanized action : @xmath60 a direct check yields @xmath61 this in turn justifies the explanation of @xmath25 as thermodynamic enthalpy .    before proceeding , let us reveal a natural constraint of the black hole solutions . from @xmath62",
    "we get @xmath63 . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) we get @xmath64 . inserting both into , one can obtain @xmath65 which leads to the constraint on @xmath5 and @xmath66 @xmath67 this constraint implies an upper bound of @xmath5 at fixed horizon radius @xmath66 , or an upper bound of @xmath66 at fixed temperature @xmath5 .",
    "to consider the @xmath0 criticality of the black hole , we should begin with the equation of state ( eos ) in @xmath0 plane at fixed conserved charges @xmath56 and @xmath36 .",
    "the eos arises from the expression for the temperature @xmath5 .",
    "however , to use as a reasonable eos , we need to eliminate the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath32 . assuming that both of these parameters are nonzero .",
    "then the condition @xmath62 yields @xmath68 inserting into eqs.([relation ] ) and ( [ temperature ] ) respectively , one gets @xmath69 then from eq.([eq2 ] ) , we find @xmath70 inserting this into eq.([eq1 ] ) , we get the eos @xmath71 solving this equation for @xmath6 we get @xmath72 and thanks to the condition ( [ tem ] ) , both branches of solutions should be considered physical . comparing the above expressions for the pressure with the van der waals equation @xmath73 we are tempted to use the variable @xmath74 as an effective specific volume for the black hole system under consideration .",
    "thus we rewrite the full eos as @xmath75    the critical points @xmath76 results from the conditions @xmath77 the partial derivative in and can be evaluated directly using , which read @xmath78 solving these two equations and substituting into , we get two sets of critical point parameters as follows .    1 .   when @xmath79 , @xmath80 2 .",
    "when @xmath81 , @xmath82    in the above , @xmath83 can take two discrete values @xmath84 or @xmath85 : @xmath86 however , the physical critical point must obey the constraints @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which lead to @xmath90 this exclude the choice @xmath81 and @xmath91 , and we are left with a single critical point which is characterized by the parameters @xmath92 in which @xmath93 .",
    "these parameters satisfy the relation @xmath94 which gives a pure number and is independent of all parameters .",
    "actually , this relation is very similar to the one of the van der waals system , which behaviors as @xmath95 at its critical point .",
    "however , if one replaces @xmath96 in eq.([pvt ] ) by the thermodynamic volume @xmath31 , the result of this relation will be no longer independent of parameters . in this sense",
    ", it is more natural to consider @xmath96 as the specific volume instead of the thermodynamic volume @xmath31 .",
    "note that the existence of critical point also exclude the possibility of @xmath97 .",
    "also , the square sum of the charge @xmath56 and the signature @xmath19 must also be nonzero .",
    "therefore , there is neither need to distinguish the case @xmath98 from the @xmath99 cases ( as long as @xmath100 ) nor need to distinguish the @xmath101 case from the @xmath102 cases ( as long as @xmath103 ) .",
    "one may also be curious about the cases with @xmath104 ( the bps black hole ) or @xmath105 , both of which will result in an eos of ideal gas after considering eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) directly .",
    "thus they are all out of our discussion .",
    "another degenerated case @xmath106 corresponds to the schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "in this case one can never find physical critical points as is known in @xcite .",
    "the isothermal plots at generic parameters @xmath107 are depicted in fig.[pv ] ( the right plot is a magnification of a single isotherm at the temperature @xmath108 ) .",
    "while creating the plots , we take @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively as units for @xmath111 and @xmath2 .",
    "the pressure corresponding to the extremal specific volume is denoted @xmath112",
    ".    it can be seen that on each isotherm there is an upper bound for the specific volume ( black hole radius ) @xmath113 . for @xmath114",
    ", the isotherm can be subdivided into two segments , i.e. the lower branch and the upper branch , which reflect the double - valuedness of the pressure .",
    "the difference between the @xmath115 and @xmath3 curves lies in that , each branch of the isotherm in the former case is monotonic with respect to the special volume @xmath96 , while the lower branch in the latter case is non - monotonic . consequently phase transitions will occur only in the @xmath3 regime .",
    "another way of subdividing the isotherms is according to the sign of @xmath116 , which is inversely proportional to the isothermal compressibility @xmath117 according to the sign of the isothermal compressibility , each isotherm with @xmath3 can be subdivided into 4 segments , two with positive isothermal compressibility and two with negative isothermal compressibility .",
    "let us take a closer look at the magnified plot given on the right diagram in fig.[pv ] .",
    "this is a curve corresponding to isotherm with @xmath108 .",
    "the lower and upper branches of the curve is joined together at the point d which corresponds to the extremal specific volume @xmath113 and the pressure @xmath118 .",
    "on the lower branch ( plotted in solid line ) one can see that there is a local maximum @xmath119 and local minimum @xmath120 for @xmath6 , the corresponding points on the isotherm are marked with b and c respectively .",
    "the 4 segments of the isotherm are @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively . among these ,",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath124 have negative isothermal compressibilities which imply that black hole states falling in these segments may be unstable .",
    "the right plots in fig.[pv ] is typical for all @xmath3 . at such temperatures",
    ", we can subdivide the range of the pressure into 4 regimes : @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 . when @xmath129 , there is a single unstable black hole phase represented by the segment @xmath130 .",
    "due to its unstable nature , a perturbative increase in the pressure would result in an increase of the black hole radius until it reaches the state m , then through a phase transition it will enter the second regime for the pressure , @xmath126 . in this second regime for the pressure , there are 3 different black hole states for a single pressure value , among these , only the one with intermediate sized specific volume ( i.e. the state lying on the segment @xmath131 ) is stable .",
    "therefore , as the pressure increases , the black hole state will evolve from the state c until the state k is reached and then the pressure enters the next regime , @xmath127 .",
    "there are still 3 black hole states at each pressure values in this regime , however , two of these have positive isothermal compressibility ( i.e. the states lying on the @xmath132 and @xmath133 segments ) , so it is hard to tell which is more stable by looking at the eos alone .",
    "if the pressure enters the fourth regime , @xmath128 , then there is only a single stable phase which corresponds to states on the segment @xmath134 . from the above analysis",
    ", it is clear that there are two possible phase transition points , the first one occurs at @xmath135 , where the black hole will most probably transit from the state @xmath136 to the state @xmath137 which is more stable upon perturbation .",
    "the second phase transition point occurs either at @xmath118 ( if the gibbs free energy on the segment @xmath132 is higher than that on @xmath133 ) or at @xmath138 ( if the gibbs free energy on the segment @xmath132 is lower than that on @xmath133 ) . in the next subsection",
    ", it will be clear that the gibbs free energy on the segment @xmath132 is always lower than it is on @xmath133 , so the second phase transition point occurs at @xmath138 , where the black hole picks the state b instead of n , because the state @xmath139 has lower gibbs free energy than the state @xmath140 .      in order to have a further look at the critical points , we need to plot the gibbs free energy versus pressure at fixed temperature .",
    "the gibbs free energy @xmath141 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is quite complicated and can not be given explicitly with ease .",
    "so we will try to present the @xmath142 relationship in terms of a pair of parametric equations .",
    "first we can invert the relation to get @xmath6 as a function of @xmath5 and other parameters .",
    "eliminating @xmath18 in the resulting expression by use of , we get @xmath143 where we have also replaced @xmath66 by @xmath144 . inserting this equation together with into",
    ", we get @xmath145 in and , @xmath32 can not be taken as a free parameter , because there is an extra constraint ( [ eq1 ] ) , which can be rewritten as @xmath146 this quadratic algebraic equation gives two solutions for @xmath32 as a function of @xmath147 .",
    "picking each solution and substituting into and , the resulting pair of equations can be taken as parametric definition for the function @xmath148 for constant @xmath5 .",
    "so , we can easily plot the @xmath142 diagram at constant @xmath5 , which is presented in fig.[gp ] .     versus @xmath6 at constant temperatures .",
    "on the intersections with vertical axes , the temperature decreases from bottom to top , and the temperatures for each curve are in one to one correspondence to the isotherms given in fig.[pv ] . the right plot is a magnification of the lower - left corner of the ( red ) line with the highest temperature in the left plot .",
    "the marked points are the same as in the right plot of fig.[pv ] .",
    "the global minimum of the gibbs free energy in the right plot is highlighted by the thick line.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   versus @xmath6 at constant temperatures .",
    "on the intersections with vertical axes , the temperature decreases from bottom to top , and the temperatures for each curve are in one to one correspondence to the isotherms given in fig.[pv ] .",
    "the right plot is a magnification of the lower - left corner of the ( red ) line with the highest temperature in the left plot .",
    "the marked points are the same as in the right plot of fig.[pv ] .",
    "the global minimum of the gibbs free energy in the right plot is highlighted by the thick line.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it can be seen in fig.[gp ] that , for all @xmath3 , a downcast swallow tail appears on each @xmath142 curve . from @xmath149 and downwards ,",
    "the swallow tail disappears , with @xmath149 corresponding to the critical point .",
    "this is different from that of a van der waals liquid - gas system , where @xmath115 is required for a phase equilibrium .",
    "the same phenomenon has also been observed in the study of criticality associated with the gb coupling constant @xcite in gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the downcast swallow tail is different from the usual upcast one , which corresponds to first order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "on the magnified plot given on the right plot of fig.[gp ] , it is clear that the gibbs free energy on the segment @xmath150 is lower than that on @xmath151 and @xmath152 . at @xmath135 and @xmath138 , there exist discontinuities for the gibbs free energy , indicating that there are zeroth order phase transitions at these two particular pressures .",
    "if one follows the red curve given in the left plot of fig.[gp ] , it would be clear that at sufficiently high pressure , the gibbs free energy on the dotted segment would eventually become lower than it is on the solid segment .",
    "this implies that the thermodynamics of the system favors large pressure states .",
    "on the other hand , if one looks at the gibbs free energy versus temperature plots at fixed pressure ( fig.[gt ] ) , one would see the similar downcast swallow tail at @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , following a single @xmath153 curve reveals that the system favors high temperature states if the pressure is kept fixed .",
    "in this paper , we considered the @xmath0 criticality of static charged ads black holes in conformal gravity . unlike the cases of einstein gravity ,",
    "the cosmological constant arises as an integration constant in conformal gravity , making the analysis for @xmath0 criticality more self - contained , e.g. without need to consider systems with different actions .",
    "the thermodynamics in the extended phase space for black hole in conformal gravity possesses several unusual features :    * there exists only one critical point but there are two phase transition points , both of which corresponds to zeroth order phase transitions ; * there is no first order phase transition in the system ; * the phase transition can occur only when @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) but not the other way round ; * at fixed @xmath3 , the system favors large pressure states , whilst at fixed @xmath4 , the system favors high temperature states .",
    "we do not know of any other black hole or ordinary matter systems which exhibit similar thermodynamic behaviors",
    ". it would be interesting to find other examples which yield similar behaviors , because otherwise the system under study would seem to be too bizarre to understand .",
