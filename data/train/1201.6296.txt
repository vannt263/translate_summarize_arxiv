    "recently new results for the structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath15 of deep inelastic electron- and positron - proton scattering ( dis ) have been published by the h1 collaboration @xcite . in this note",
    "we compare these results with predictions of the popular colour - dipole model of dis .",
    "that is , we investigate if the data respect certain bounds for the ratios of structure functions .",
    "these bounds are rigorous predictions of the dipole model and rely only on the non - negativity of the dipole - proton cross section .    the kinematics of @xmath16 scattering is well known , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the reaction is [ 1.1 ] e^(k ) + p(p ) e^(k ) + x(p ) and we use the variables [ 1.2 ]    q & = k - k = p - p , & q^2 & = -q^2 , + w^2 & = ( p + q)^2 , & x & = = .    the measured structure functions @xmath15 and @xmath0 are related to the cross sections @xmath17 and @xmath18 for absorption of transversely or longitudinally polarised virtual photons by [ 1.3 ]    f_2(x , q^2 ) & = ( 1-x ) , + f_l(x , q^2 ) & = ( 1-x ) _",

    "is frequently used to describe the data . for various applications of the dipole model see for instance @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    "this dipole picture was thoroughly examined using functional methods of quantum field theory . in particular , the assumptions were spelled out which one has to make in order to arrive at the standard dipole - model formulae for @xmath17 and @xmath18 or , equivalently , @xmath15 and @xmath0 ,    [ 1.4 ] f_2 ( x , q^2)&= ( 1-x ) _ q^2 r ^(q)(r , ) , + f_l(x , q^2 ) & = ( 1-x ) _ q^2 r w^(q)_l(r , q^2 ) ^(q)(r , ) ,    see section 6 of @xcite . in @xmath20 are the probability densities for the virtual photon @xmath21 splitting into a quark - antiquark pair of flavour @xmath22 and transverse separation @xmath23 .",
    "their standard expressions are given in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "an integration over the quark s longitudinal momentum is performed .",
    "the cross section for the @xmath24 pair scattering on the proton is denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "this cross section depends on @xmath23 and an energy variable @xmath26 the choice of which is left open here . in @xcite it was argued that the correct variable to choose is @xmath27 .",
    "however , in the literature the energy variable used most frequently in the dipole cross section is @xmath28 .    in the standard dipole model",
    "formulae the densities @xmath20 are known ( see appendix [ app1 ] ) but the dipole - proton cross sections @xmath29 have to be taken from a model . in the following",
    "we shall only use that they have to be non - negative , [ 1.5 ] ^(q)(r,)0 .",
    "this alone allows to derive a non - trivial upper bound , valid in any dipole model , on the ratio [ 1.6 ] r(x , q^2 ) = see @xcite .",
    "equivalently , one can obtain a non - trivial upper bound on the ratio [ 1.6a ] = .",
    "this bound can be substantially improved if information on the charm structure function @xmath30 is included @xcite .",
    "there is then an allowed domain , again valid in any dipole model , for the two - dimensional vector [ 1.7 ] ( x , q^2)=    f_l(x , q^2)/f_2(x , q^2 ) + f_2^(c)(x , q^2)/f_2(x , q^2 )    .",
    "it is the purpose of this note to confront the dipole - model bounds on @xmath5 and on the vector @xmath31 with the new hera results @xcite .",
    "this is done in section [ sec:2 ] . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we discuss the results , and we give a summary in section [ sec:4 ] .",

    "@xmath40 see appendix a of @xcite . for massless quarks",
    "the function @xmath41 depends only on the dimensionless variable [ 2.2 ] z = qr , such that we can write [ 2.2a ] ( z ) = g(q , r,0 ) .",
    "the function @xmath42 has a maximum at [ 2.3 ] z_m = 2.5915 with [ 2.4 ] ( z_m)=0.27139 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that [ 2.5 ] g(q , r , m_q ) ( z_m ) for all @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "using then the dipole - model formulae lead to the bound [ 2.6 ] ( z_m ) = 0.27139 .",
    "we note that the bound for @xmath5 is equivalent to the bound for @xmath46 derived in @xcite , [ 15new ] r(x , q^2 ) = 0.37248 .",
    "data for @xmath0 and @xmath15 at the same kinematic points are presented in @xcite for @xmath1 values ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath48 @xmath49 . the data for the same @xmath1 value span a small range of @xmath50 and this range varies strongly with @xmath1 ; see figure 12 of @xcite . on the other hand , for all @xmath1 bins the data are inside a narrow @xmath51 interval [ 2.6a ] 167 - 232 with a mean value of about @xmath52 gev .",
    "therefore , in the following we find it more convenient to consider @xmath0 and @xmath15 as functions of @xmath51 and @xmath1 instead of @xmath50 and @xmath1 .    since we do not expect any large variation of the ratio @xmath53 for fixed @xmath1 within the @xmath51 interval of the measurement we have averaged the h1 data @xcite for given @xmath1 .",
    "error weighted averages @xmath54 are calculated taking into account the total uncorrelated and correlated experimental uncertainties .",
    "the averages are confronted with the bound in figure [ fig2new ] .",
    "averages @xmath55 confronted with the dipole - model upper bound represented by the dotted line . the data are extracted from @xcite .",
    "[ fig2new],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we note firstly , that electromagnetic gauge invariance requires [ 2.7 ] 0 for @xmath56 at fixed @xmath51 .",
    "the data indicate , indeed ,",
    "a decrease of @xmath5 for small @xmath1 . fitting @xmath5 with a constant value , as done in @xcite , does not seem very plausible physically , in view of .",
    "the second point to note is that the data in figure [ fig2new ] are rather close to the upper bound from the dipole model , especially so for [ 2.8 ] 3.5 ^2 q^2 20 ^2 .",
    "the bound on @xmath5 can be improved if one takes into account that there is a non - vanishing contribution from charm quarks to @xmath0 and @xmath15 , see @xcite .",
    "specifically , considering massless @xmath57 and @xmath58 quarks , a massive @xmath59 quark and neglecting @xmath60 quarks we can derive certain allowed domains for the vector @xmath31 from the dipole model . again these domains depend only on the known photon densities @xmath20 , see - , and on the non - negativity of the cross sections @xmath29 , see .",
    "that is , for any dipole model with the standard photon probability densities @xmath20 the vector @xmath31 must be inside the appropriate allowed domain for the given @xmath1 value .",
    "a detailed description of how these domains are obtained has been given in @xcite .",
    "the allowed domains can be understood as correlated bounds for the ratios @xmath5 and @xmath61 .",
    "more precisely , one obtains for any given @xmath50 and @xmath1 an upper bound on @xmath5 which depends on the value of @xmath61 at the same kinematic point .",
    "in figure [ fig4 ] we show these allowed domains and the corresponding data .",
    "versus @xmath61 for @xmath62 to @xmath63 . in the dipole model ,",
    "the shaded areas are excluded by the correlated bounds for @xmath5 and @xmath61 .",
    "the dotted line is the bound on @xmath5 only .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    the bounds are calculated for a charm quark mass of @xmath64 gev . for each data",
    "point the corresponding ratio @xmath61 is obtained using nlo qcd calculations provided by the openqcdrad package @xcite , again with a charm pole mass of @xmath65 gev . for this calculation the jr09ffnnlo parametrisation @xcite of the proton parton density functions was used , which was found to describe preliminary hera charm data @xcite very well within the experimental correlated uncertainties of typically 3 - 9% . here and in the following",
    "we do not consider the data point at @xmath66 from @xcite as it has an exceedingly large error .",
    "the significance of the data points in relation to the bound can be seen more clearly from the quantity [ 2.51 ] which we plot in figure [ fig5 ] . for this figure",
    "the bound @xmath67 for each data point is extracted from figure [ fig4 ] taking into account the corresponding value of @xmath61 at that kinematical point .",
    ", see , where the bound on @xmath5 results from taking into account the value of @xmath61 at the kinematical point of each data point . [ fig5],scaledwidth=85.0% ]",
    "we see from figures [ fig2new]-[fig5 ] that the data for @xmath55 as derived from @xcite come very close to the bounds which result from the dipole picture .",
    "we now discuss the meaning of this observation from the points of view of both , a dipole - model enthusiast , and a dipole - model sceptic , respectively .",
    "the dipole - model enthusiast will say that within the errors of the data the bounds are respected .",
    "furthermore , he can use the data to give qualitative arguments concerning the behaviour of the dipole - proton cross sections for small and large radii @xmath23 . let us assume power behaviour of @xmath25 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , [ 100 ]    ^(q)(r , ) r^a & r 0 , + ^(q)(r , ) r^2-b & r .",
    "taking into account we find that the integrals for @xmath15 and @xmath0 in are convergent if [ 101 ] a>0 b>0 .",
    "of course , with the usual assumptions of colour transparency for small @xmath23 , implying @xmath70 , and of saturation for the dipole - proton cross sections for large @xmath23 , implying @xmath71 , the requirements are satisfied . from the experimental findings of figures [ fig2new ] to [ fig5 ]",
    "we can now give qualitative arguments based on the data , that the exponents @xmath72 and @xmath60 in can not be too small .",
    "indeed , for a small value of @xmath72 the cross sections @xmath25 would decrease only slowly for @xmath68 and this region of small @xmath23 would contribute significantly in the integrals .",
    "but , as we see from the second plot in figure [ fig1 ] , the function @xmath35 is small there and this would lead to a small value for @xmath5 , much below the bound , contrary to what is seen in the data .",
    "a similar argument applies to the exponent @xmath60 in , considering the large @xmath23 behaviour of @xmath35 in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "thus , the dipole - model enthusiast may hope that with more data it may even be possible to determine the exponents @xmath72 and @xmath60 from the data on @xmath5 directly without making model assumptions for @xmath25 .",
    "let us now go over to the point of view of the dipole - model sceptic .",
    "he will note that some central values of the data for @xmath5 in figure [ fig4 ] are , in fact , _ above _ the corresponding bound .",
    "if any of the measured points with @xmath73 is confirmed , with corresponding small error , by further experiments then , as a clear consequence , the standard dipole picture would not be valid at this kinematic point .",
    "but what would be the consequences if the bound for @xmath5 is not _",
    "violated _ but _ saturated _ ?    for the sake of the argument we shall now for a moment _ assume _ that the bound for @xmath5 is reached in the @xmath1 range . clearly , this is not incompatible with the data , see figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the consequence is that the dipole - proton cross sections @xmath25 in should only contribute at that particular @xmath23 values where the functions @xmath35 and @xmath74 of have their maximum .",
    "this is for both functions the case for [ 200 ] r .",
    "we see this for @xmath35 from the second plot in figure [ fig1 ] and this also holds for @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the cross sections @xmath25 should be strongly peaked at these @xmath23 values for the whole @xmath1 interval , something like a @xmath75 function [ 3.2 ] ^(q ) ( r , ) ( r - ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath23 values range from @xmath76 fm for @xmath77 to @xmath78 fm for @xmath79 . with increasing @xmath80 the position of the delta function peak in moves to smaller @xmath23 values .",
    "as we have argued at length in @xcite , the correct energy variable in the dipole - proton cross section @xmath81 is @xmath27 .",
    "since the data on @xmath5 is essentially at one value of @xmath82 gev ( more precisely , in the narrow range around @xmath83 ) we get from a @xmath1 dependence in @xmath84 which should _ not _ be there .",
    "the conclusion is that a saturation of the bound on @xmath5 in a whole @xmath1 interval as in is incompatible with the dipole model and the dipole - proton cross sections having the correct functional dependence @xmath85 .    with the  incorrect",
    " choice of energy variable @xmath28 in @xmath25 we get the following . since the data on @xmath5 is essentially at @xmath86 ( namely in the narrow range around @xmath83 ) , we have from [ 3.4 ] x , q w_0 .",
    "inserting this in gives [ 3.5 ] ^(q)(r , x ) ( r- ) .",
    "thus , there is in this case no immediate conflict with the functional dependence @xmath87 .",
    "but we note that as @xmath50 _ decreases _ the peak of the cross section @xmath87 in shifts to _ larger _ values of @xmath23 .",
    "this is in contrast to what one finds in popular dipole models , like the one invented by golec - biernat and wsthoff @xcite .",
    "there , one assumes a dipole - proton cross section saturating at large @xmath23 with an @xmath50-dependent saturation scale .",
    "but in that model for _ decreasing _ values of @xmath50 the cross section @xmath87 moves to _ smaller _ values of @xmath23 , see figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "this is in contradiction to what we found above in .",
    "the dipole - model sceptic could , furthermore , argue as follows . since the bounds explored in the present paper are just more or less satisfied by the data it will certainly pay to explore further rigorous bounds which can be constructed using the methods of @xcite .",
    "one could , for instance , consider correlated bounds on @xmath5 at different @xmath1 values .",
    "it remains to be explored if the dipole model survives such extended tests .",
    "in this paper we have compared the recent data on @xmath5  to be precise : their fixed-@xmath1 averages  with rigorous bounds derived in the framework of the dipole model . within the experimental errors the bounds are satisfied .",
    "but the data is surprisingly close to the bounds for @xmath88 .",
    "we have discussed the meaning of these findings from the points of view of both , the dipole - model enthusiast and the sceptic .",
    "the enthusiast will have to admit that the sceptic s arguments could give problems to the dipole picture if the central values of the data are confirmed with small errors by further experiments .",
    "the sceptic will have to concede that , given the errors of the data , @xmath75 functions for the cross sections @xmath25 as in and are not really necessary and that the widths of the distributions compatible with the data have to be explored .",
    "thus , given the present data , we must leave it to the reader if he will join the camp of the enthusiast or that of the sceptic .",
    "more data with small errors would be needed to decide the issue . in any case",
    "we hope to have demonstrated in our paper that measurements of @xmath5 give very valuable information on the dipole picture , its validity , and potentially on questions like colour transparency and saturation of the dipole - proton cross section .",
    "thus , programs for future electron- and positron - proton scattering experiments ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) certainly should foresee @xmath0 measurements as an important item on the list of physics topics .",
    "we are grateful to sascha glazov for providing data tables and information on correlated data uncertainties .",
