    "the problem of predicting the dynamic evolution of @xmath1 physical interacting objects or quantities , commonly known as the @xmath1-body problem , is an important subject of research in science and engineering .",
    "the study of this problem plays a key role in many fields , including celestial mechanics @xcite , nuclear physics , solid - state physics , and molecular physics @xcite . in many cases , the dynamics of the @xmath1 objects",
    "is governed by a force , which is a sum over two - body forces .",
    "this is the situation in celestial mechanics @xcite and in other systems @xcite , and it has been discussed extensively in the literature . a different but equally interesting dynamic scenario emerges when the @xmath1-body dynamics is determined by a force involving @xmath0-body interaction with @xmath10 @xcite . indeed , @xmath0-body forces with @xmath10 have been employed in a variety of problems including van der waals interaction between atoms @xcite , interaction between nucleons in atomic nuclei @xcite , and in cold atomic gases in optical lattices @xcite . a fundamental question in these studies concerns the physical mechanisms responsible for the emergence of @xmath0-body interaction with a given @xmath0 value .",
    "a second important question revolves around the dependence of the interaction strength on @xmath0 and on the other physical parameters . in the current study",
    "we investigate a new class of @xmath1-body problems , in which @xmath0-body forces play a dominant role .",
    "more specifically , we study the role of @xmath0-body interaction in fast collisions between @xmath1 solitons of the cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation in the presence of generic weak nonlinear loss . in this case the solitons experience significant collision - induced amplitude shifts , and important questions arise regarding the role of @xmath0-pulse interaction in the process , and the dependence of the amplitude shift and the @xmath0-pulse interaction on the physical parameters .",
    "the nls equation is one of the most widely used nonlinear wave models in the physical sciences .",
    "it was successfully employed to describe a large variety of physical systems , including water waves @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , pulse propagation in optical waveguides @xcite , and nonlinear waves in plasma @xcite .",
    "the most ubiquitous solutions of the nls equation are the fundamental solitons .",
    "the dynamics of fundamental solitons in these systems can be affected by loss , which is often nonlinear @xcite .",
    "nonlinear loss arises in optical waveguides due to gain / loss saturation or multiphoton absorption @xcite .",
    "it is also quite common in certain bose - einstein condensates @xcite and in many other systems that are described by the complex ginzburg - landau equation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to study the impact of nonlinear loss on the propagation of fundamental nls solitons .",
    "the main effect of weak nonlinear loss on the propagation of a single nls soliton is a continuous decrease in the soliton s energy .",
    "this single - pulse amplitude shift is qualitatively similar to the one due to linear loss , and can be calculated in a straightforward manner by employing the standard adiabatic perturbation theory .",
    "nonlinear loss also strongly affects the collisions of nls solitons , by causing an additional decrease of soliton amplitudes .",
    "the character of this collision - induced amplitude shift was recently studied for fast soliton collisions in the presence of cubic and quintic loss @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies indicate that the amplitude dynamics in soliton collisions in the presence of generic nonlinear loss might be quite complicated due to @xmath0-pulse interaction effects .",
    "more specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the total collision - induced amplitude shift in a fast three - soliton collision in the presence of _ cubic _ loss is given by a sum over amplitude shifts due to two - pulse interaction , i.e. , the contribution to the amplitude shift from three - pulse interaction is negligible .",
    "in contrast , in ref . @xcite it was found that three - pulse interaction enhances the amplitude shift in a fast three - soliton collision in the presence of _ quintic _",
    "loss by a factor of 1.38 .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that @xmath0-pulse interaction with @xmath11 might play an important role in fast nls soliton collisions in the presence of generic or high - order nonlinear loss . despite of this fact ,",
    "a systematic analytic or numerical study of the role of @xmath0-pulse interaction in these collisions is still missing . in the current study",
    "we address this important problem . for this purpose ,",
    "we first develop a general reduced model for amplitude dynamics , which allows us to calculate the contribution of @xmath0-pulse interaction to the amplitude shift for collisions in the presence of weak @xmath2-order loss , for any @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "we then use the reduced model and numerical solution of the perturbed nls equation to analyze soliton collisions in the presence of septic loss @xmath4 .",
    "our calculations show that three - pulse interaction gives the dominant contribution to the collision - induced amplitude shift already in a full - overlap four - soliton collision .",
    "furthermore , we find that the amplitude shift strongly depends on the initial soliton positions with a pronounced maximum in the case of a full - overlap collision .",
    "we then generalize these results for generic weak nonlinear loss of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the physical field and @xmath7 is a taylor polynomial of degree @xmath8 .",
    "we consider @xmath9 , as an example .",
    "that is , we take into account the effects of linear , cubic , quintic , and septic loss on the collision .",
    "we show that in this case three - pulse interaction gives the dominant contribution to the amplitude shift in a six - soliton collision , despite the presence of linear and cubic loss .",
    "our study uncovers a new type of @xmath0-body interaction involving fast collisions of nls solitons , and demonstrates that this interaction plays a key role in collisions in the presence of generic nonlinear loss .",
    "moreover , the scalings of @xmath0-pulse interaction effects with @xmath0 and @xmath3 and the strong dependence on initial positions lead to complex collision dynamics .",
    "this dynamics is very different from the one encountered in fast @xmath1-soliton collisions in the presence of weak cubic loss , where the total collision - induced amplitude shift is a sum over amplitude shifts due to two - pulse interaction @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ] , we obtain the reduced model for amplitude dynamics in a fast @xmath1-soliton collision in the presence of weak nonlinear loss .",

    "[ simu ] , we analyze in detail the predictions of the reduced model for the amplitude shifts in four - soliton and six - soliton collisions .",
    "in addition , we compare the analytic predictions with results of numerical simulations with the perturbed nls equation . in sec . [ conclusions ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "appendix a is devoted to the derivation of the equation for the collision - induced change in the soliton s envelope due to @xmath0-pulse interaction in a fast @xmath1-soliton collision .",
    "consider propagation of soliton pulses of the cubic nls equation in the presence of generic weak nonlinear loss @xmath12 , where @xmath6 is the physical field . in the context of propagation of light through optical waveguides , for example , @xmath6 is proportional to the envelope of the electric field .",
    "assume that @xmath12 can be approximated by @xmath5 , where @xmath7 is a taylor polynomial of degree @xmath8 .",

    "we first calculate the collision - induced change in the amplitude of the @xmath29th soliton due to @xmath2-order loss .",
    "the dynamics is determined by the following perturbed nls equation @xmath36 we start by considering the amplitude shift of the @xmath29th soliton due to @xmath0-pulse interaction with solitons with indexes @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath40 . employing a generalization of the perturbation method developed in ref .",
