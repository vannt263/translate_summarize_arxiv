    "research on bn based materials have grown gradually in recent years.@xcite this is not only due to their fascinating properties , such as hardness , high melting point , and large band gap , but also due to the geometric similarity of planar , two dimensional ( 2d ) bn to graphene .",
    "scientists already achieved the synthesis of single layer bn honeycomb structure on substrates@xcite and a few layer thick structures from 3d hexagonal ( h-)bn either on a substrate or freestanding.@xcite recently , jin _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite reported the fabrication of freestanding bn honeycomb structure ( we specify it simply as 2d bn throughout the text ) .",
    "the realization of the synthesis of 2d bn is rapidly attracting interest on bn , since it has 2d hexagonal lattice , which is commensurate to the lattice structure of covalently bonded graphene .",
    "more recently , the synthesis of single layer composite structures consisting of adjacent 2d bn and graphene domains is realized.@xcite however , unlike semi - metallic graphene , 2d bn is a nonmagnetic , wide band gap semiconductor with an indirect energy gap of @xmath1 ev@xcite calculated within generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the indirect gap is further corrected to @xmath2 ev with gw@xmath3 self - energy method by ahin _ _ et al.__@xcite a theoretical comparative study of 3d and 2d bn , and its nanoribbons comprising their mechanical , electronic and magnetic properties was reported by topsakal _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite 2d bn , and their nanoribbons can be easily functionalized by many different ways for different purposes such as doping@xcite , exchange of atoms and vacancies.@xcite    in this paper , using state - of - the - art first principles plane wave calculations we investigate the effects of adatoms adsorbed on 2d bn , as well as the substitution of foreign atoms for b and n atoms in the honeycomb structure .",
    "we consider both high coverage ( where the coupling between adjacent foreign atoms is substantial ) and low coverage ( where the coupling is negligible ) .",
    "we conclude that at high coverage ( or decoration ) of specific adatoms one can turn the nonmagnetic , wide band gap material into magnetic , metallic or even half - metallic states . at low coverage ,",
    "adatoms give rise to localized states in the band gap .",
    "we perform first - principles , spin - polarized plane wave calculations@xcite within density functional theory ( dft)@xcite using paw ( projector augmented - wave ) potentials.@xcite the exchange - correlation potential is approximated by generalized gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite for the partial occupancies , we use the methfessel - paxton smearing method.@xcite the width of the smearing for all structures is chosen as @xmath4 ev for geometry relaxations and band structure calculations .",
    "for accurate density of states ( dos ) calculations the width of smearing is taken as @xmath5 ev .",
    "we consider a single adatom adsorbed to each ( 2x2 ) and ( 4x4 ) supercells of 2d bn structure and treat the system using periodic boundary conditions . for high coverage corresponding to @xmath6 , ( 2x2 )",
    "supercell is used , while low coverage , @xmath7 , is treated by using ( 4x4 ) supercell .",
    "a large spacing ( at least @xmath8  ) between adjacent 2d bn layers is taken to prevent interlayer interactions .",
    "the number of plane waves used in expanding bloch functions and * k*-points used in sampling the brillouin zone ( bz ) are determined by a series of convergence tests . in the self - consistent potential and the total energy calculations",
    ", the bz is sampled by ( 15x15x1 ) mesh points in * k*-space within monkhorst - pack scheme@xcite for the ( 2x2 ) supercells . for calculations involving ( 4x4 ) supercells , the number of * k*-points is taken as ( 9x9x1 ) .",
    "for accurate density of states ( dos ) calculations , * k*-points samplings are further increased to ( 25x25x1 ) and ( 15x15x1 ) for the ( 2x2 ) and ( 4x4 ) supercells , respectively . a plane - wave basis set with the kinetic energy cutoff @xmath9 ev is used .",
    "all the atomic positions and lattice constants are optimized by using the conjugate gradient method , where the total energy and the atomic forces are minimized .",
    "the convergence is achieved when the difference of the total energies of last two consecutive steps is less than @xmath10 ev and the maximum force allowed on each atom is 0.03 ev /  .",
    "the pressure on the system is kept smaller than @xmath11 kbar per unit cell in all of the calculations . as a rule ,",
    "the structure becomes more energetic as its total energy is lowered .",
    "charge transfer values are calculated according to the bader analysis.@xcite",
    "the lowest energy sites of various adsorbed atoms are determined by placing foreign atoms initially to four possible adsorption sites at a height of @xmath12     from bn plane as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] . upon fully self - consistent geometry optimizations with both spin - polarized and spin - unpolarized configurations , where all atoms in the supercell are relaxed in all directions , we determine the equilibrium site as the lowest energy configuration among four different sites .",
    "the binding energy of an adsorbed adatom is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total energy of bare 2d bn , @xmath15 is the total energy of free adatom calculated in the vacuum .",
    "@xmath16 is the total energy of 2d bn structure with adsorbed adatom .",
    "we investigated the adsorption of following single adatoms , namely sc , ti , v , cr , mn , fe , mo , w , pt , h , c , si , b , n , o , ca , cu , pd , ni and zn . among these atoms ,",
    "cr , mn , mo , w , h , n , ca and zn can not bind to 2d bn .",
    "the electronic and magnetic properties of 2d bn are modified through adatom adsorption at high coverage .",
    "the adatom - adatom distance is @xmath17 5   at @xmath6 , where the magnetic coupling may be crucial in determining the ground state . in order to account for the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling between adatoms and to allow their reconstruction we treated @xmath6 coverage in ( 4x4 ) supercell , which includes four ( 2x2 )",
    "supercells each having a single adatom .",
    "this way adatom - adatom distance of @xmath17 5   is maintained .",
    "we further carried out geometry relaxation with three different initial magnetic ordering of adatoms .",
    "first case is where adatoms are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the second case is similar to first one , but adatoms are initially coupled ferromagnetically(fm ) .",
    "the last case corresponds to a spin - unpolarized , nonmagnetic ( nm ) , geometry relaxation .",
    "our calculations indicate that cu , ni , pd and pt adatoms have nonmagnetic ground state for @xmath6 , whereas sc , ti and v have afm ground state .",
    "oxygen is the only adatom which is found to be in the fm ground state .",
    "boron and carbon adatoms undergo a reconstruction to lower the total energy in ( 4x4 ) supercell at @xmath6 . among all adatoms ,",
    "si and fe present the most interesting situation , where 2d bn monolayer is changed to half - metallic state .",
    "however , these adatoms have small binding energies and thus are excluded from our further analysis .",
    "also cu having a binding energy smaller than 0.25 ev is also excluded from our study .",
    "our results are given in table [ tab:2x2 ] . in figure",
    "[ fig:2x2-nonmagnetic ] , the calculated energy band structures and corresponding total density of states ( tdos ) and partial density of states ( pdos ) of ni , pd or pt adatom+2d bn system are presented .",
    "the band structure of bare 2d bn folded to ( 2x2 ) bz is also presented to reveal the effect of the adatom adsorption on the electronic structure .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         we now examine the electronic and magnetic structure of 2d bn substituted by al , c , and p described schematically in fig . [",
    "fig : substitution ] .",
    "al substituting for b and being in the same group with b , but having a relatively large atomic radius , distorts the planar structure of bn layer and is located at a position @xmath18      higher than the substituted b atom .",
    "the valence band of the bn layer does not influence much upon substitution , but states derived from @xmath19-orbitals of al adatom appear near the conduction band edge . in figure",
    "[ fig : substitution ] , @xmath20-orbitals of al are dominant in e@xmath21 state , however @xmath22 is the most contributed in e@xmath23 state . in the case of c substituting b , the valence and conduction bands of bn layer are not influenced , except minute splitting between the spin - up and spin - down states resulting from the magnetic c atom .",
    "the excess electron of the substituted c atom relative to b leads spin - polarization and fills the e@xmath21 state in fig .",
    "[ fig : substitution ] like a @xmath24-type semiconductor .",
    "when substitute for n , c atom creates electron deficiency ; states derived from @xmath19-orbitals of c atom are located near the edge of the valence band like a @xmath19-type semiconductor .",
    "@xmath20 orbital of c splits and spin - up ( e@xmath25 state in fig .",
    "[ fig : substitution ] ) becomes occupied . because of this unpaired electron c atom attains net @xmath26 total magnetic moment in both @xmath24-type and @xmath19-type substitutional doping .",
    "substituted p having relatively larger atomic radius , gives rise to the local deformation and raises @xmath27    above the plane of 2d bn honeycomb structure .",
    "this gives rise to a local dehybridization of planar @xmath28-bonding .",
    "since the upper valence bands of parent 2d bn are derived mainly from nitrogen atoms , these bands are affected upon their exchange with foreign atoms .",
    "hence several resonances appear , such as e@xmath21 and e@xmath23 in the upper part of valence band when p substitutes for n atom in fig .",
    "[ fig : substitution ] .",
    "in addition a localized state e@xmath25 occurs near the conduction band edge .",
    "in this paper , we showed that 2d bn can be functionalized to attain properties , which can be useful in future applications in nanoelectronics and nanomagnetics .",
    "functionalization can be achieved either through the adsorption of foreign atoms at different coverage or substitution of foreign atoms for b or n in honeycomb structure .",
    "we considered a number of foreign atoms , such as sc , ti , v , cr , mn , fe , mo , w , pt , h , c , si , b , n , o , ca , cu , pd , ni and zn . part of these atoms are bound with a significant energy and form chemical bonds with 2d bn .",
    "cu , fe and si have binding energy smaller than 0.25 ev , but cr , mn , mo , w , h , n , ca and zn can not bind to 2d bn .",
    "owing to the van der waals interaction , the true binding energies can be @xmath29 ev larger than those calculated with gga in the present work .",
    "high coverage of adatoms corresponding to @xmath6 leads to dramatic modifications in electronic structure , if the related binding energy is significant . under these circumstances , either the wide band gap of 2d bn",
    "can be reduced or diminished and the system becomes metallic . under certain circumstances ,",
    "the nonmagnetic 2d bn attains magnetic moment .",
    "ni , pd , and pt covered 2d bn are nonmagnetic semiconductors with band gap relatively smaller than that of the parent 2d bn .",
    "sc , ti forming a ( 2x2 ) structure on 2d bn are afm metals , v+2d bn is an afm semiconductor .",
    "remarkably , b+ and c+2d bn undergo a ( 4x4 ) reconstruction and have a band gap smaller than the parent 2d bn .",
    "oxygen covered 2d bn is found to be a fm , small band gap semiconductor , which may display high spin - polarization under bias voltage .",
    "if the interaction between adatom and 2d bn is weak , the electronic structure can be viewed as the combination of electronic band structure of 2d bn monolayer and adatom monolayer .",
    "si and fe are weakly bound to 2d bn and change the wide band gap of 2d bn to a half - metal .    at low coverage corresponding to @xmath7",
    ", the large distance between adatoms hinders any significant interaction between them .",
    "this situation is taken to mimic a single , isolated atom adsorption to 2d bn , which gives rise to localized states in the wide band gap of 2d bn honeycomb structure .",
    "this conjecture is confirmed by examining the adsorption of single c , o , sc , ti and pt to ( 8x8 ) supercell resulting in @xmath17 20   adatom - adatom distance . in this respect ,",
    "the adsorbed adatoms at @xmath7 act as dopants of 2d bn . in a few cases",
    "the adsorption site and magnetic state undergo a change by going from the high , @xmath6 to low coverage , @xmath7 .",
    "not only adatoms , but also substitution of foreign atoms for b or n in the honeycomb structure give rise to localized impurity states in the gap , which attribute interesting electronic properties to the system .",
    "in particular , the substitution of c for b yields an excess charge and gives rise to two donor states near the edge of conduction band , the lower lying spin - up band being full .",
    "in contrast , the substitution of c for n yields a single - electron deficiency and gives rise to two acceptor states above the top of valence band , the lower lying spin - up state being full . in both cases ,",
    "the unpaired spins of c atom give rise to magnetic moment @xmath30 .    in conclusion , while 2d bn is a mechanically stiff and nonmagnetic wide band gap semiconductor , its band gap can be engineered through adatom decoration . in specific cases",
    "2d bn attains magnetic properties and becomes metallic .",
    "foreign atoms adsorbing at low coverage or exchanging with b or n atoms give rise to donor like or acceptor like states in band gap . at the end ,",
    "the material achieves interesting properties .",
    "some of these properties can be exploited in future applications .",

    "when treated in the ( 2x2 ) supercell at @xmath6 , c adatoms attain net magnetic moment of 2 @xmath31 per ( 2x2 ) supercell .",
    "this configuration is , however , 0.3 ev per adatom higher ( energetically less favorable ) than those reconstructed in the ( 4x4 ) supercell .",
