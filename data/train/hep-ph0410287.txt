    "it has long been regarded that the gravitino , superpartner of the graviton in the supergravity theory , may cause serious problem in cosmology@xcite .",
    "this is because the primordial gravitinos produced in the very early universe decay with vary long lifetime . in particular , if the gravitino mass @xmath3 is smaller than @xmath4 , its lifetime is expected to become longer than @xmath5 so the primordial gravitinos decay after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) starts .",
    "even with the inflation , such a problem may not be solved ; even if the gravitinos are diluted by the inflation , gravitinos are produced by the scattering processes of the thermal particles after the reheating . as we will discuss later , the gravitino abundance becomes larger as the reheating temperature becomes higher .",
    "consequently , in order not to spoil the success of the bbn scenario , upper bound on the reheating temperature is obtained , and the primordial gravitinos provide stringent constraints on cosmological scenarios based on ( local ) supersymmetry .    thus , the effects of the gravitinos on the bbn have been intensively studied in many studies . in particular , in the past , the bbn with hadrodissociation processes induced by hadronic decays of long - lived particles was studied in several articles@xcite . after those studies , however , there have been significant theoretical , experimental and observational progresses in the study of the bbn .",
    "thus , we performed a new analysis taking account of those progresses , paying a special attention to the hadronic decay of the gravitino@xcite .",
    "the most important improvements compared to the old works are as follows .",
    "( i ) we carefully take into account the energy loss processes for high - energy nuclei through the scattering with background photons or electrons . in particular , dependence on the cosmic temperature , the initial energies of nuclei , and the background @xmath6 abundance are considered .",
    "( ii ) we adopt all the available data of cross sections and transfered energies of elastic and inelastic hadron - hadron scattering processes .",
    "( iii ) the time evolution of the energy distribution functions of high - energy nuclei are computed with proper energy resolution .",
    "( iv ) the jetset 7.4 monte carlo event generator@xcite is used to obtain the initial spectrum of hadrons produced by the decay of gravitino .",
    "( v ) the most resent data of observational light element abundances are adopted .",
    "( vi ) we estimate uncertainties with monte carlo simulation which includes the experimental errors of the cross sections and transfered energies , and uncertainty of the baryon to photon ratio .",
    "let us briefly discuss the outline of our analysis . in our study , we first calculate the gravitino abundances as a function of the reheating temperature , which is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the decay rate of the inflaton , and @xmath9 is the effective number of the massless degrees of freedom in the mssm . by numerically solving the boltzmann equations governing the evolution of the number density of the gravitino , we found that the number density of the gravitino @xmath10 normalized by the entropy density @xmath11 is well approximated by @xmath12      \\left [ 1           - 0.028 \\ln \\left ( \\frac{t_{\\rm r}}{10^{10}\\ { \\rm gev } }           \\right ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the number density of the primordial gravitino is approximately proportional to @xmath13 and hence , with higher reheating temperature , effects on the bbn becomes more significant .",
    "= 0.7    once the primordial abundance of the gravitino is given , we consider the effects of the decay of the gravitino on the bbn .",
    "importantly , the interaction of the gravitino is well constrained by the local supersymmetry and its lifetime is calculable .",
    "( for the detailed values , see the next section . ) here , we assume several reasonable values of the hadronic branching ratio @xmath14 of the gravitino , and calculated the abundances of the light elements taking account of the effects of hadronic and electro - magnetic showers induced by the decay products of the unstable gravitino .",
    "outline of our treatments of the hadronic and electro - magnetic processes is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hadronic ] , and the details of our study are discussed in the full papers@xcite .",
    "( notice that there are other recent studies on the bbn scenario with late - decaying exotic particles@xcite . )",
    "we compare the theoretically predicted values of the light - element abundances with the observations . as observational constraints on the light element abundances ,",
    "we adopt the following values , d / h = @xmath15@xcite , @xmath6 mass fraction @xmath16 by fields and olive ( fo)@xcite and @xmath17 by izotov and thuan ( it)@xcite , @xmath18@xcite , @xmath19@xcite , and @xmath20@xcite .",
    "the above errors are at 1@xmath21 level unless otherwise stated .",
    "then , we derive upper bound on the reheating temperature requiring that the theoretical predictions be consistent with the observations .",
    "now , we show the results of our analysis . here , we consider two typical case .",
    "the first case is that the gravitino dominantly decays into the gluino pair ; in this case , the hadronic branching ratio is expected to be @xmath22 and , in addition , the lifetime of the gravitino is estimated to be @xmath23 the second case is that the gravitino decays into the photon and the lightest neutralino ( which we assume to be the photino ) ; then , the hadronic branching ratio is expected to be @xmath24 and the lifetime is given by @xmath25 for these two cases , we have derived the upper bound on the reheating temperature .    =    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr ] , upper bound on the reheating temperature after the inflation is plotted as a function of the gravitino mass .",
    "the results indicates that , as the hadronic branching ratio becomes larger , constraint on the reheating temperature becomes severer . for the case with @xmath26 , for example",
    ", behavior of the upper bound can be understood in the following way . for @xmath27 ,",
    "energetic neutron is likely to decay before scattering off the background nuclei . in this case ,",
    "effects of the hadronic decay is not so significant while , in this case , effects of the photodissociation becomes comparable to or more significant than the hadrodissociation .",
    "then , the strongest constraint is from the overproduction of @xmath28 ; for @xmath29 , energetic hadrons ( in particular , neutron ) is hardly stopped by the electro - magnetic processes and hence the hadrodissociation processes become the most efficient . in particular , in this case , non - thermal productions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 provide the most stringent constraint ; for @xmath32 , the @xmath33 conversion processes are efficient and significant amount of @xmath34 may be converted to @xmath35 resulting in the enhancement of @xmath6 . in this case , the constraint from the overproduction of @xmath36 is the most significant ; for @xmath37 , gravitino decays before the bbn starts . in this case , no upper bound is obtained on the reheating temperature .",
    "in our study , we have studied the effects of the unstable gravitino on the bbn , paying particular attention to the hadronic decay modes .",
    "as we have emphasized , as the hadronic branching ratio becomes larger , constraints become more stringent .",
    "our results have significant implications .",
    "in particular , for the gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking , gravitino mass is expected to be @xmath38 . in this case , even if the hadronic branching ratio is @xmath39 , the reheating temperature is constrained to be smaller than @xmath40 . if the gravitino mass is much larger than @xmath38 , the constraint on @xmath13 may be relaxed . with such gravitino , however , the hadronic branching ratio would be close to @xmath22 since , in such a case , all the superpartners of the standard - model particles are expected to be lighter than the gravitino from the naturalness point of view .",
    "( such a mass spectrum may be realized in the anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario@xcite . ) for @xmath41 with @xmath42 , the upper bound is given by @xmath43 .",
    "for the cosmology , since the reheating temperature is required to be very low when the gravitino mass is @xmath44 , baryogenesis should occur with very low reheating temperature .",
    "this fact imposes significant constraints on some of the scenarios of the baryogenesis , in particular for the leptogenesis scenario with right - handed neutrinos@xcite .",
