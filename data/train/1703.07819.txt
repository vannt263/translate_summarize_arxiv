    "single - particle interferometry became a remarkable tool in various fields of quantum physics and sensor technology .",
    "interferometers for coherent atoms @xcite recently investigated the nature of time @xcite and measured inertial forces @xcite and gravitational acceleration @xcite .",
    "molecule interferometers @xcite proved the wave nature of large particles @xcite and contributed to the understanding of quantum decoherence @xcite . in neutron interferometers",
    "@xcite , the quantum - mechanical phase shift due to the earth s gravitational field was observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , remarkable progress was achieved in the field of matter - wave interferometry with charged particles such as electrons and ions @xcite based on new developments concerning the beam source @xcite , the precise electron guiding @xcite , the coherent beam path separation by nanostructures @xcite and highly resolved spatial and temporal single - particle detection @xcite .",
    "this advance opened the door for experiments in aharonov - bohm physics @xcite and coulomb - induced decoherence @xcite .",
    "technical devices with interfering single particles can decrease the amount of destructive particle deposition in electron microscopy for the analysis of fragile biological specimen @xcite .",
    "all these technical @xcite and fundamental applications @xcite of single - particle interferometers are based on the high phase sensitivity and are therefore susceptible to dephasing , which can be caused by external electromagnetic oscillations , mechanical vibrations or temperature drifts .",
    "in contrast to decoherence @xcite , where actual information of the quantum state is lost to the environment , dephasing is a collective , time - dependent phase shift of the interference pattern . both , decoherence and dephasing , cause a reduction of the contrast of the time - averaged interference pattern on the detector . however , in opposite to decoherence , dephasing can in principle be corrected after the measurement , if the temporal and spatial information of the single - particle events are known",
    "then , two - particle correlations may be used to study the dephasing process and to reveal the undisturbed interference pattern .",
    "ever since the famous hanbury brown and twiss experiment @xcite , second - order correlations are successfully used in many research areas .",
    "thereby , noise correlations play a key role , as they give direct access to the quantum nature of the source .",
    "this understanding has not only set the fundament for modern quantum optics @xcite , but also helped to prove the quantum nature of fermions @xcite and bosons @xcite .",
    "today , noise correlation analysis is widely used in modern astrophysics @xcite , quantum atom optics @xcite and particle physics @xcite . for matter - waves ,",
    "temporal correlations have been used to analyze the counting statistics of atom lasers @xcite and to demonstrate the coherent transfer of magnetic field fluctuations onto an atom laser @xcite .",
    "spatial correlations , on the other hand , have been used to analyze atoms in optical lattices @xcite or to study many - body states , such as the mott insulator state , in cold atom physics @xcite .    in previous publications @xcite",
    "we have demonstrated in a biprism electron interferometer @xcite , how multifrequency dephasing caused by electromagnetic @xcite and vibrational oscillations @xcite can be corrected using second - order correlation analysis in combination with the amplitude spectrum of the correlation function .",
    "latter can be used for the identification of unknown perturbation frequencies @xcite , as according to the wiener - khintchine theorem @xcite the fourier transform of the correlation function is equal to the power spectrum of the perturbed measurement signal .",
    "for the measurements , an interference pattern was shifted artificially by external perturbations leading to a contrast reduction of the temporally integrated pattern on the detector . using the time and position information of particle impacts at the detector ,",
    "the numerical second - order correlation function was extracted . with this , we were able to reveal the unknown perturbation frequencies , corresponding amplitudes and the characteristics of the matter - wave , such as contrast and pattern periodicity .",
    "the undisturbed interference pattern could be reconstructed with the parameters of the perturbation .",
    "our method is a powerful tool to prove the wave nature of particles , even if the integrated interference pattern is vanished .",
    "therefore , it reduces the requirements for electromagnetic shielding and vibrational damping of the experimental setup , e.g. for mobile interferometers or experiments in a perturbing environment .",
    "furthermore , it can be used to sensitively detect electromagnetic and mechanical perturbations or for the spectroscopy of the electromagnetic and vibrational response spectrum of an interferometer @xcite .",
    "therefore , this technique has the potential for the application in sensor technology and can in principle be applied in interferometers for electrons @xcite , ions @xcite , neutrons @xcite , atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite that generate a spatial fringe pattern in the detection plane . for the application of the correlation analysis , the devices have to be equipped with a detector with high spatial and temporal single - particle resolution , which is available for all above mentioned interferometers .",
    "another requirement is , that the particle flight time is shorter than the cycle time of the perturbation .",
    "otherwise , the particles traverse many periods of the perturbation and therefore the perturbation is averaged out and can not be resolved .",
    "this article provides a comprehensive description of the applied theory , being the base for the experimental application of second - order correlations in single - particle interferometry . in the first chapter ,",
    "we give a detailed derivation of the two - dimensional second - order correlation theory for multifrequency perturbations leading to the equations applied in former dephasing experiments @xcite .",
    "we deduce the explicit solution for the correlation function and explain under which conditions an approximation can be applied .",
    "the characteristics of the explicit and approximate solutions are discussed and the determination of the matter - wave properties is shown . furthermore , we calculate the analytic solution of the corresponding amplitude spectrum used for the identification of the unknown perturbation frequencies and amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the invariance of the correlation function under time and space transformations is analyzed in detail and the consequence for the determination of the perturbation parameters is shown .    in the second part of this article",
    ", we investigate the general characteristics of numerical correlation functions .",
    "they are typically derived from a finite set of measurement data , causing statistics and noise to play an important role .",
    "temporal and spatial discretization , then influences not only the contrast and the amplitude spectrum of the correlation function , but also the corresponding noise levels .",
    "this limits the maximal signal - to - noise ratio in the correlation analysis . from our theoretical study",
    ", we identify an optimal discretization step size for best sensitivity .",
    "using single - particle simulations of a perturbed interference pattern , we cross - check our theoretical description and show , how the correlation theory can be used to identify broad - band frequency noise .",
    "in this chapter , the theory of second - order correlations in single - particle interferometry is derived and the properties are discussed in detail .",
    "first , the contrast reduction of a time - averaged interference pattern dephased by a perturbation is analyzed .",
    "afterwards , the explicit solution of the second - order correlation function is calculated and discussed under which conditions an approximate solution is suitable",
    ". the determination of the contrast and spatial periodicity of the unperturbed interference pattern is demonstrated .",
    "the corresponding amplitude spectra used for the identification of unknown perturbation frequencies are derived . at the end of the chapter",
    ", the invariance of the correlation function under time and space transformations is analyzed in detail and the consequence for the determination of the perturbation phases is discussed .",
    "in many experiments in single - particle interferometry , the interference pattern is detected using multichannel plates ( mcps ) in conjunction with a phosphor screen @xcite .",
    "the particle impacts generate light pulses on the phosphor screen , that are temporally integrated with a charge - coupled device camera ( ccd - camera ) .",
    "an interference pattern , that is dephased by a temporal perturbation , is then irreversibly  washed - out \" in the spatial signal and its contrast is reduced .",
    "this behaviour shall be calculated in the following .",
    "the probability distribution , that describes the particle impacts in the detection plane forming the interference pattern , is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 assures normalization , @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicate the contrast and wave number of the unperturbed interference pattern , with the spatial periodicity @xmath4 .",
    "the time - dependent perturbation @xmath5 is described as a superposition of @xmath6 harmonic frequencies @xmath7 @xmath8 with perturbation amplitudes ( peak phase deviations ) @xmath9 and phases @xmath10 .",
    "the perturbation leads to a washout of the time - averaged interference pattern .",
    "for one perturbation frequency ( @xmath11 ) , this can be easily seen by calculating the time - average of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath12 resulting in @xmath13 using bessel functions of first kind @xmath14 , the exponential function can be rewritten as @xmath15 yielding @xmath16 only for @xmath17 , the limit of the time integral is equal to one . for all other @xmath18 , it approaches zero , such that the time - averaged interference pattern becomes @xmath19 the perturbation thus leads to a reduced contrast @xmath20 given by the perturbation amplitude : @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . in figure [ fig1 ] at the top ,",
    "the dependence of the time - averaged interference pattern ( equation ( [ eq7 ] ) ) on the peak phase deviation @xmath23 is illustrated .",
    "the interference pattern with a spatial periodicity of @xmath24{mm}$ ] can be identified in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "the reduced contrast @xmath20 normalized to the contrast of the unperturbed interference pattern @xmath2 is plotted at the bottom of figure [ fig1 ] . for a peak phase deviation of @xmath26{\\pi}$ ] , the contrast is zero corresponding to the first zero of @xmath27 .",
    "the contrast returns for larger peak phase deviations , but does not recover completely . additionally , the interference pattern is phase shifted by @xmath28 as the sign of @xmath27 changes from positive to negative . this behaviour is repeated for higher peak phase deviations and the contrast is further reduced",
    ".    for multifrequency perturbations ( @xmath29 ) with peak phase deviations @xmath30 , equation ( [ eq7 ] ) becomes @xmath31 here , the reduced contrast @xmath32 depends on all peak phase deviations @xmath9 , via the product of the zeroth order bessel functions .",

    "this is possible , because in the correlation function the spatial and temporal differences are taken into account in contrast to the temporally integrated interference pattern .",
    "then , on timescales below the perturbation frequency , the interference pattern is still visible and not influenced by the perturbation .",
    "furthermore , the characteristics of the perturbation ( frequencies @xmath7 , peak phase deviations @xmath9 and phases @xmath10 ) can be determined from the correlation analysis .    with the probability distribution in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , the second - order correlation function reads @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the average over position and time @xmath36 if the acquisition time @xmath37 and length @xmath38 are large compared to the involved perturbation frequencies @xmath39 and spatial periodicity @xmath40 , equation ( [ eq9 ] ) can be solved analytically .",
