    "protontherapy @xcite is a special kind of radiotherapy using proton beams with an energy ranging between 70  mev and 230  mev .",
    "because proton beams undergo little scattering in matter and deliver most of the irradiation dose at a specific depth ( bragg peak ) depending on their initial energy , tumors can be precisely targeted while sparing surrounding tissues . at first , protontherapy was mainly limited to very specific kind of cancers , such as eye cancers , but with time its applications got more and more diversified to become fully part of the cancer therapy toolbox . while the energy dose delivered by the beam to the tumor causes its inactivation , the dose prescribed by the physician and the one delivered by the irradiation unit should be as close as possible .",
    "one of the main issues is to conform the delivered dose to the target volume with no consideration on its shape . to this end ,",
    "the iba company and the massachusetts general hospital team have developed a dose delivery mode called pencil beam scanning ( pbs ) @xcite .",
    "it uses a very narrow beam ( few millimeters of standard deviation ) to scan ( similarly to spot scanning @xcite ) the whole tumor in three dimensions ( x and y by scanning and z by changing the beam energy ) while modulating the beam intensity to get the prescribed dose map .",
    "one of the fundamental safety requirements of the pbs technology is to check in real - time during the scanning process that the beam is at the right position in space with the correct intensity . in this work",
    "we are going to focus on the charge measured by an air - ionization chamber ( or ic ) @xmath2 ( in pc ) while the final aim of this detector is to have an estimate of the deposited the dose @xmath3 ( in gy ) .",
    "those quantities are deeply linked ( see eq .",
    "[ eqdose ] ,  [ eqcharge ] ,  [ eqdose2 ] ) through the proton fluency @xmath4 ( in mm@xmath5 ) , the linear energy transfer @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( mevmm@xmath8 ) respectively in the medium where the dose is deposited and in the detector , the ionization potential in air ( @xmath9 in mev ) , the air - gap @xmath10 ( in mm ) of the ic and also the density of the medium in which the dose is deposited @xmath11 ( in g@xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    in practice , every ionization chamber has to be carefully calibrated , to allow the conversion from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , through a commissioning process .",
    "we have developed a 320  mm @xmath16 320  mm parallel plate ionization chamber composed of fifteen mylar foils separated by 5  mm air gaps .",
    "the detector is called ic2/3 for ionization chamber 2 and 3 while it is composed of two identical and fully independent ( power supply and electronic acquisition setup ) units ic2 and ic3 .",
    "these two chambers allow achieving dose measurement redundancy , a fundamental requirement for safety purposes . as sketched in fig .  [ icmapping ] each unit",
    "is composed of five 2.5  @xmath1 m mylar electrodes coated on both sides with aluminum or gold .",
    "three are connected to the high voltage ( or hv ) while the two others are measurements electrodes ( virtually grounded ) , one being used for dose measurement ( uniform film ) and the second one for beam position measurement ( striped film ) along one axis ( horizontal for ic2 and vertical for ic3 ) .",
    "apart from the two units , three other films are put to the ground to ensure the electrostatic pressure equilibrium . in addition , two thicker ( 25  @xmath1 m ) mylar film are used to cover both entrance and exit windows .",
    "the whole chamber is 6.86  cm thick for a total water equivalent thickness of 187  @xmath1 m .",
    "the specifications for the ic2/3 monitoring device were to have a global uniformity in the measurement dose response better than 1% after correction ( inhomogeneities , edge effects , ... ) .",
    "because the beam spot swipes the whole detector , the detector response should be position - independent .",
    "the beam - induced ionization in the air - detector should be identical at any position in the detector ; while the beam direction has a normal incidence with the detector , the main parameter affecting the response is the potential variation of the 5 mm air gap between electrodes ( see eq .  [ eqcharge ] ) .",
    "the design study showed that the layers localized at the center of the detector are less affected by the electrostatic pressure and therefore have less variation in their gap width .",
    "as a consequence , the dose measurement layers are located in the middle of the chamber and are surrounded by the position measurement mylar films .    to localized the beam centroid",
    ", there are two main solutions , films can be either pixalized or striped @xcite for the position measurement layer . here",
    ", it was chosen to use strips to have less electronic channels at identical spatial resolution .",
    "the position measurement layers are plain mylar films covered by au - strips on both sides deposited by vacuum evaporation .",
    "there are 64 4.8  mm - stripes with a 5  mm - step , oriented to give the x and y position for ic2 and ic3 respectively .",
    "dose measurement layers are single layer aluminized mylar foils covered in the plain side by a thin gold layer ( 200  nm ) .",
    "the dose is measured by integrating the signal collected on each film at a frequency of 2  khz ( allowing a time resolution of 500  @xmath1s ) with the faster acquisition framework ( developed at lpc - caen ) using the electrometer ddc232 from @xmath17 ) .",
    "three series of tests were performed at the westdeutsches protontherapiezentrum essen to evaluate the performances of the ic2/3 detector with a proton beam .",
    "the wpe is equipped with an iba proteus 235 device , a cyclotron producing proton beams in the energy range from 70 to 230  mev .",
    "the tests were realized in a treatment room with a pencil beam scanning delivery technique and equipped with an isocentric gantry .",
    "results of the first two ic2/3 prototypes were compared to those of a ptw ionization chamber ( @xmath18@xmath19 - @xmath20 ) placed in air one meter away from the isocenter . during the tests",
    "different beam configurations ( table  [ table : beams ] ) were used with different energies , intensity and sizes , while the beam used is a gaussian shape its size ( standard deviation ) will be referred to as @xmath21 .    [",

    "measurements were performed at an intensity of 2.8  na with 100  mev - protons and a @xmath21= 4.76  mm while the hv of ic2/3 was set at 1.2  kv . the charge measured by both ic2 and ic3 ( respectively @xmath22 and @xmath23 )",
    "were realized at the same time and normalized by the ptw measurement ( @xmath24 ) to prevent from beam fluctuations .",
    "positive and negative charges created in the chamber by protons might recombine while traveling toward their respective collection electrodes @xcite .",
    "this effect depends , among other factors , on the gas density and the drifting time of each charge type .",
    "the saturation of the operating mode is reached when all charges created are collected ( 100% collection efficiency ) and this can be approached when the polarization voltage of the electrodes is high enough . the goal was to determine the lowest polarization voltage allowing a collection efficiency better than 99% .",
    "measurement were performed irradiating the detector with a beam at constant current and decreasing the polarized voltage by steps of 100  v. decreasing the voltage instead of increasing it allows preventing recombination to occur at some measurement and modifying results of the following steps . this way , only the last measurement ( at lowest voltage ) might be perturbed .",
    "this saturation curves were measured for the four first beam configurations of table  [ table : beams ] .",
    "the aim of the linearity test is to check that the relation between the deposited dose and the measured charge is truly linear .",
    "measurements were performed by irradiating the detector with a decreasing beam intensity from 3  na to 0.5  na ( beam configuration 5 on the table  [ table : beams ] ) while keeping the integration time constant . in order to reduce the beam intensity in the ptw reference chamber and prevent it from any saturation ,",
    "it was placed ( in air ) one meter away from the ic2/3 detector with a 3  mm thick lead foil between them enlarging the beam by scattering .",
    "this test would be consider satisfactory if the standard deviation on the three ratios : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is lower than 1% .",
    "the detector can measure either the beam intensity integrated on the whole detector area or on each strip , allowing to infer beam position and size .",
    "the uniformity test allows testing that the intensity is correctly measured on the whole detector area . as the required dose uniformity should be less than 1%",
    ", the mechanical structure should insure that the variation in the air gap ( see eq .  [ eqcharge ] ) has to be under 1% . the experimental setup to measure such uniformity",
    "consists of two ic2/3 chambers ( fig .",
    "[ uniformityschem ] ) .",
    "the first one is fixed on the nozzle and the second one is located 132  cm away on a mobile treatment bed .",
    "using two ic2/3 chambers allows to avoid the beam inhomogeneities by dividing the charge measured at a given position in the chamber 2 ( @xmath28 ) by the one measured at the center of chamber 1 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this test was performed with the beam configuration 3 on the tab .",
    "[ table : beams ] .",
    "each strip of the chamber measures a part of the charge created in the air volume crossed by the beam . in the orthogonal plane to the beam ,",
    "the beam distribution exhibits a two dimensional gaussian shape .",
    "therefore the signal integrated by each strip corresponds to this gaussian curve integrated over the strip surface . matching an unknown gaussian curve ( eq .",
    "[ eqgauss ] ) with the charge distribution measured by the two arrays of strips allows finding the height ( @xmath30 ) , the center ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and the standard deviation ( @xmath33 ) of the gaussian in two dimensions for the fit .",
    "the gaussian fit is still possible on the edge of the chamber even if the measured dose profile is not perfectly gaussian as shown in the previous paragraph .",
    "@xmath34    even if the curve fitting is mandatory to get values of @xmath33 and @xmath30 , in practice , a faster way to get a good estimate ( @xmath35 ) of the centroid position ( @xmath31 ) is to use barycentric calculation , as presented on eq .",
    "[ eqbarycentre ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the central position on the @xmath38-strip and the charge collected on it .",
    "we can calculate of an estimated error ( @xmath39 ) as a function of the relative position of the centroid on its strip ( @xmath40 ) for different beam sizes , the results are presented in term of resolution in table  [ table : centroidestimate ] .",
    "therefore , to get a resolution better than 5  @xmath1 m the beam standard deviation should be larger than 2.5  mm , and this is the case with every beam used in this article .",

    "after that , the impact of the relative centroid estimate @xmath42 ) on the @xmath33 calculation will be measured with the same beam but in scanning mode to evaluate the resolution on the beam size .",
