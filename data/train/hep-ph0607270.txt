    "cosmological data ranging from rotation curves of spiral galaxies to the cosmic microwave background tell us that most of the mass in the universe is provided by non - luminous , `` dark '' matter ( dm ) ; see @xcite for reviews . to be concrete",
    ", the recent measurements from wmap @xcite and sdss @xcite imply a ( dominantly cold ) dark matter density of @xmath0 to an accuracy of about 10% at @xmath1 .",
    "the nature of this dark matter is one of the big puzzles of present - day physics .",
    "although there are also other explanations , such as primordial black holes , many lines of reasoning suggest that the dm consists of a new weakly interacting massive particle , a so - called wimp .    at the same time , we know that the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , despite its tremendous success at energies up to @xmath2  gev , is incomplete . for well - founded theoretical reasons , which i do not have to explain to this audience , we expect new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) to emerge at the tev energy scale .",
    "this exciting new frontier will soon be probed by the lhc ! in attempts to embed the sm in a more fundamental frame ,",
    "theorists have come up with a wealth of bsm theories .",
    "these theories typically predict new particles , which may be discovered at the lhc .",
    "the lightest of these new particles is often stable by virtue of a new discrete symmetry and provides a natural dm candidate .",
    "the dark matter candidates such put forth by particle physics are quite numerous @xcite and contain , for example , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supersymmetry ( susy ) with r - parity conservation ; the lightest kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) excitation in models with extra dimensions and kk - parity ; the lightest t - odd state in little higgs models with t - parity ; etc .",
    "note that all these possibilities are generally testable in collider experiments .",
    "this creates a very strong interplay between particle physics , at both theoretical and experimental levels , and cosmology .    in this talk ,",
    "i discuss this interplay using the example of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a neutralino lsp as the dm candidate .",
    "i focus in particular on the requirements for collider tests for determining whether the neutralino can be the dm in the universe .",
    "i want to stress , however , that the general statements of this talk hold also for other , including non - susy , models .",
    "the standard assumption is that the dark matter particle , let us call it @xmath3 , is a thermal relic of the big bang as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : freezeout ] .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "when the early universe was dense and hot , @xmath4 , @xmath3 was in thermal equilibrium ; annihilation of @xmath3 and @xmath5 into lighter particles , @xmath6 , and the inverse process @xmath7 proceeded with equal rates .",
    "as the universe expanded and cooled to a temperature @xmath8 , the number density of @xmath3 dropped exponentially , @xmath9 .",
    "eventually the temperature became too low for the annihilation to keep up with the expansion rate and @xmath3 ` froze out ' with the cosmological abundance observed today .",
    "the time evolution of the number density @xmath10 is described by the boltzman equation , @xmath11\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the hubble expansion rate , @xmath13 is the equilibrium number density , and @xmath14 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section summed over all contributing channels .",
    "it turns out that the relic abundance today is inversely proportional to the thermally averaged annihilation cross section , @xmath15 .",
    "when the properties and interactions of the wimp are known , its thermal relic abundance can hence be computed from particle physics principles and compared with cosmological data .",
    "as mentioned above , bsm scenarios with wimp - dm candidates are testable at colliders . an important point in this regard",
    "is the following .",
    "being electrically neutral and stable , the wimp escapes the detector as missing energy and momentum .",
    "the preferred discovery channels therefore rely on the production of other new particles present in the theory and their subsequent decays into the dm candidate . by measuring the properties and decay kinematics of these new particles , one",
    "should then be able to determine the properties of the wimp .",
    "if the measurements are precise enough , this allows to predict the annihilation cross sections and hence the thermal relic density of the dm candidate , thus checking the consistency between a particular model of new physics and cosmology .    at the lhc",
    ", the generic wimp signature is jets ( plus leptons ) plus large missing transverse energy .",
    "this is often regarded as the golden susy signature , but it also holds for other models .",
    "this is great for discovery , but resolving the underlying theory and the nature of the dm candidate will not be trivial . for mass measurements , precisions of a few percent can be expected . to decisively distinguish , for instance , susy from other bsm",
    ", spin measurements will be necessary .",
    "see @xcite for first attempts along this line . in terms of predicting @xmath16 , the precisions achievable at the lhc",
    "will , however , in general not be sufficient to match those of wmap and other cosmological experiments .",
    "to this aim , precision measurements of masses , couplings and quantum numbers of the new states at a future international @xmath17 linear collider ( ilc ) will be necessary in addition .",
    "this will be described in more detail below .",
    "let me now put the spotlight on a particular bsm dm candidate , the neutralino lsp of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . the neutralino mass matrix in the bino  wino ",
    "higgsino basis @xmath18 is @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gaugino masses and @xmath22 the higgsino mass parameter .",
    "furthermore , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 being the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs fields @xmath29 ) .",
    "this matrix is diagonalized by a unitary mixing matrix @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , are the ( non - negative ) masses of the physical neutralino states with @xmath34 .",
    "the lightest neutralino is then decomposed as @xmath35 it will hence be mostly bino , wino , or higgsino , according to the smallest mass parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ntmassmat ] ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , or @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "if the @xmath38 is the lsp and r - parity is conserved , this indeed provides an excellent cold dark matter candidate  @xcite .    for its relic abundance to be in the right range",
    ", the neutralino lsp must annihilate efficiently enough .",
    "the relevant processes are ( for a comprehensive discussion , see @xcite ) : annihilation of a bino lsp into fermion pairs through @xmath39-channel sfermion exchange in case of very light sparticles ; annihilation of a mixed bino  higgsino or bino  wino lsp into gauge boson pairs through @xmath39-channel chargino and neutralino exchange , and into top - quark pairs through @xmath40-channel @xmath41 exchange ; and finally annihilation near a higgs resonance ( the so - called higgs funnel ) .",
    "furthermore , coannihilation processes with sparticles that are close in mass with the lsp may bring @xmath42 in the desired range .",
    "in particular , coannihilation with light sfermions can help to reduce the relic density of a bino - like lsp .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] .",
    "note that coannihilation generically occurs when there is a small mass gap between the lsp and the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) . in scenarios with a higgsino or wino lsp ,",
    "one has in fact a mass - degenerate triplet of higgsinos or winos , and coannihilations are so efficient that @xmath42 turns out much too small , unless the lsp has a mass of order tev .    requiring that the neutralino lsp provides all of the cold dark matter , i.e. @xmath43 at 2@xmath44 ,",
    "puts strong constraints on the parameter space of the general mssm .",
    "it puts even tighter bounds on models which assume specific relations between the soft - breaking parameters , such as msugra , the cmssm , amsb , string - inspired models , etc .      from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that in order to predict the relic density of the lsp from collider experiments , we need to determine the properties of all sparticles potentially involved in the lsp ( co)annhilation processes .",
    "that means not only determining the lsp mass but also the other neutralino , chargino , sfermion and higgs masses ( or at least lower limits on them to be sure that their contribution to @xmath45 is negligible ) as well as the relevant sparticle mixings",
    ". naturally the question arises of which precisions are necessary in order to infer @xmath42 with @xmath46 accuracy , compatible with the wmap precision .",
    "this was studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for various cases of dominant ( co)annihilation channels .",
    "two examples , the case of stau coannihilation and the case of annihilation near the pseudoscalar higgs resonance , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : accuracies ] .",
    "coannihilation with staus occurs for small neutralino ",
    "stau mass differences , typically @xmath47  gev . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : accuracies ] , this mass difference needs to be measured to better than 1  gev .",
    "obviously this will be very difficult at the lhc , where one relies on the measurement of the @xmath48 invariant mass from cascade decays involving @xmath49",
    "the reason is that for small @xmath50 the @xmath51 from the @xmath52 decay is soft and can easily be missed .",
    "moreover , even if both taus in ( [ eq : tautau ] ) can be detected , one can not tell whether the soft one comes from the @xmath53 or the @xmath54 decay .",
    "therefore one can not tell whether it is @xmath50 or @xmath55 that is small .",
    "in addition to a precise determination of @xmath50 , one also needs to measure the absolute masses and the mixing angles with good accuracy ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : accuracies ] . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "this may be achieved in the clean experimental environment of the ilc ; tunable beam energy and beam polarization are , however , essential for this aim .",
    "the higgs funnel and the higgsino - lsp scenarios are even more challenging . in the former , one needs precisions at the percent or even permille level on @xmath56 , @xmath57 , the distance from the pole @xmath58 , the pseudoscalar width @xmath59 , and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath22 . in the latter",
    ", one needs to resolve the complete neutralino system with @xmath60 accuracy .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "the limitation of the ilc lies mostly in the kinematic reach : the heavy higgs and neutralino / chargino states may simply be too heavy to be produced , in which case one has to rely on lhc measurements .",
    "see @xcite for an example of susy parameter determination from combined lhc / ilc analysis .",
    "it becomes clear that for a precise prediction of @xmath42 from colliders , we will need precision measurements of most of the mssm spectrum . a combination of lhc and ilc analyses",
    "@xcite may prove essential for this purpose .",
    "so far we have only considered the cp - conserving mssm . in general , however , several parameters of the mssm can be complex , thus introducing new sources of cp violation ( cpv ) in the model .",
    "this is indeed a very interesting possibility since , given the higgs mass bound of @xmath61  gev from lep @xcite , the amount of cpv present in the sm is not sufficient to generate the correct baryon asymmetry in the universe .    the parameters that can have cp phases are the gaugino and higgsino masses and the trilinear sfermion ",
    "higgs couplings .",
    "although constrained by electric dipole moments , non - zero phases can significantly influence the phenomenology of susy particles .",
    "they can also have a strong impact on the higgs sector , inducing scalar  pseudoscalar mixing through loop effects  @xcite .",
    "this can in turn have a potentially dramatic effect on the relic - density prediction in the higgs funnel region : neutralino annnihilation through @xmath40-channel scalar exchange is @xmath62-wave suppressed ; at small velocities it is dominated by pseudoscalar exchange . in the presence of phases , both heavy higgs bosons can , for instance , acquire a pseudoscalar component and hence significantly contribute to neutralino annihilation , even at small velocities . likewise ,",
    "when only one of the resonances is accessible to the neutralino annihilation , large effects can be expected by changing the scalar / pseudoscalar content of this resonance .",
    "cp phases however do not only impact @xmath42 in the higgs funnel region  they can lead to important effects in almost any scenario of neutralino ( co)annihilation . in ref .",
    "@xcite we analysed in detail the influence of cp phases in the various scenarios of neutralino annihilation and coannihilation for which the lsp is a ` good ' dm candidate .",
    "we found effects of up to an order of magnitude from modifications in the couplings due to non - zero cp phases ( note that care has to be taken to disentangle phase effects in couplings and kinematics ) .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : mlsp140 ] shows @xmath42 as a function of the phase of @xmath36 , @xmath63 , for a mixed bino ",
    "higgsino lsp , which dominantly annihilates into @xmath64 .     as a function of @xmath65 for a mixed bino ",
    "higgsino lsp scenario with @xmath66  gev and @xmath67 ; the dashed line is for fixed @xmath68  gev , while for the full line @xmath36 is adjusted such that @xmath69  gev remains constant .",
    "the green ( grey ) band shows the @xmath70 wmap range . from @xcite.,height=207 ]    the largest effects are found , as expected , for annihilation through higgs exchange , not only because of scalar ",
    "pseudoscalar higgs mixing but also because a phase in the neutralino sector modifies the lsp s couplings to scalar and pseudoscalar states @xcite .",
    "let me emphasize , however , that even in scenarios which feature a modest phase dependence , the variations in @xmath42 often exceed @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , when aiming at a precise prediction of the neutralino relic density from collider measurements , one does not only need precise sparticle spectroscopy as assumed in @xcite  one also has to precisely determine the relevant couplings .",
    "this includes the determination of possible cp phases .",
    "suppose that we have discovered susy with a neutralino lsp and made precision measurements of all the relevant parameters , as pointed out above .",
    "it may turn out that the @xmath42 of the neutralino thus inferred is below the cosmological dark matter abundance .",
    "we would be lead to conclude that there exists yet another dm constituent , or else that there is some non - thermal mechanism contributing to the neutralino relic density .",
    "however , what if the inferred @xmath42 is too high ?",
    "there are several solutions to this problem .",
    "for one , the @xmath38 may only appear to be the lsp but decay into an even lighter sparticle outside the detectors . in this case",
    "the @xmath38 would actually be the nlsp and the real lsp would be , for instance , a gravitino or axino .",
    "the thermal relic abundance would then roughly scale with @xmath73 .",
    "strong constraints on this scenario come from bbn limits on late @xmath74 , @xmath75 , etc .",
    "( for details , see @xcite . )",
    "solution number two is that r - parity is violated after all , but on long time scales so that the @xmath38 again appears stable in collider experiments .",
    "on cosmological scales , late decays of the @xmath38 would have reduced its number density to zero , and the actual dark matter would be something else .",
    "solution number three is that our cosmological assumptions are wrong .",
    "our picture of dark matter as a thermal relic from the big bang may well be too simple ; the early universe may have evolved differently .",
    "note also that the exact value and uncertainty of @xmath72 extracted from cosmological data depend on both the precise datasets used and the choice of parameters allowed to vary @xcite .",
    "we expect new physics beyond the standard model at the tev energy scale , and there is well - motivated hope that this new physics also provides the dark matter of the universe .",
    "this creates a strong interplay between theoretical particle physics , collider experiments , and cosmology . using the example of a neutralino lsp in the mssm ,",
    "i have argued that precision measurements at lhc and ilc will be necessary to pin down the nature and properties of the dark matter candidate .",
    "two more comments are in order .",
    "first , even if bsm with a wimp dm candidate is discovered at future colliders , the properties of the wimp are measured precisely and its @xmath72 thus deduced matches the cosmological value , this is no proof that this wimp is indeed the dm .",
    "direct and/or indirect detection @xcite will be indispensible in addition . here",
    "note that the rates for ( in)direct detection can also be predicted once the properties of the wimp are known .",
    "second , the interplay between particle physics and cosmology is not limited to the dark matter question .",
    "another example for this interplay is the baryon asymmetry of the universe , where particle physics offers explanations through electroweak baryogenesis or leptogenesis .    to conclude ,",
    "i think it is fair to say that these are exciting times for both particle physics and cosmology , with a steadily growing synergy between the two fields .",
    "whepp-9 was a wonderful workshop , leaving a rich memory of physics discussions , old and new acquaintances with colleagues from india and elsewhere , strolls into the streets of bhubaneswar , and of course indian cuisine .",
    "i wish to thank the organizers for inviting me there",
    ". financial support by the austrian academy of sciences and the whepp-9 host organization , institute of physics , is also gratefully acknowledged .",
