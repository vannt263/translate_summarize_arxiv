    "the study of the clustering of galaxy clusters , in the early eighties , allowed a basic advancement in our understanding of large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the galaxy correlation length @xmath12 and the cluster correlation length @xmath0 ( bahcall & soneira 1983 , klypin & kopylov 1983 , but see also hauser & peebles 1973 ) led to the introduction of the concept of bias ( kaiser 1984 ) .",
    "data on @xmath0 were then worked out , in further detail , for abell clusters by peacock & west ( 1992 ) and postman , huchra & geller ( 1992 ) , as well as for clusters in apm and in edinburgh ",
    "durham southern galaxy catalogs , by dalton et al ( 1992 ) , nichol et al ( 1992 ) and croft et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "these analyses show that the value of @xmath0 depends on the mass threshold ( @xmath13 ) of the cluster sample , through its mean intercluster separation @xmath14 , and that @xmath0 increases with @xmath1 .",
    "however , @xmath0 values obtained from abell and apm data seem only partially consistent ; this is to be partially ascribed to different cluster definitions ; bahcall & burgett ( 1986 ) , bahcall & cen ( 1992 ) and bahcall & west ( 1992 ) suggested that observational ambiguities are wide enough to allow to conjecture that the scaling relation @xmath15 holds for @xmath16 .",
    "herebelow , we shall refer to this relation as bw conjecture .",
    "it ought to be born in mind that , above @xmath17mpc , such conjecture hinges on the estimates of @xmath0 for 55 and 94@xmath9mpc mean separations , for richness @xmath18 and @xmath19 abell clusters , while apm data , for the same @xmath1 range , give smaller @xmath0 .",
    "dekel et al ( 1989 ) and sutherland & efstathiou ( 1991 ) suggested that the projection effects and peculiar inhomogeneities in the abell sample might have biased upward @xmath0 at large @xmath1 .",
    "peacock & west ( 1992 ) , instead , confirmed such points ( see also jing , plionis & valdarnini , 1992 ) .",
    "altogether , it may be fair to say that the controversy on the observational behaviour of @xmath0 for high @xmath1 values has not been solved yet , although , as we shall see , there may be good reasons to assess that different cluster definitions play a key role .",
    "this paper is devoted to a comparison of cluster clustering , as it emerges from such data , with simulations of three cosmological models : a tilted cdm ( tcdm ) model and two mixed models ( mdm1 and mdm2 ) with cold+hot dm .",
    "all models have critical matter density , vanishing vacuum energy , and are cobe normalized . during the last few years",
    ", much attention has been devoted to models with a positive cosmological constant @xmath20 , also because of the remarkable data sets concerning sn ia ( see , e.g .",
    ", riess et al 1998 , perlmutter et al 1998 , and references therein ) . in this work",
    ", we shall not debate whether mixed models can still offer a fair fit to all cosmological data ; they certainly do not fit sn ia data , unless their current interpretation was misled by some systematic bias . in a number of cases ,",
    "however , mixed models were just not tested and the success of @xmath20models to fit some data set was directly taken as further evidence in their favour . in the case of cluster clustering , we shall show that mixed models perform quite well and are surely better than any other model with matter density parameter @xmath21 considered until now .    in order to fit cluster data with a model",
    ", a large simulation volume is required ; in fact , we need a fair sample of galaxy clusters for large @xmath1 , as well as adequate mass and force resolutions , to identify clusters in a reliable way , for small @xmath1 .",
    "simulation parameters are therefore set so to allow a sample of 90 clusters , at least , for large @xmath1 and @xmath22 baryon  cdm particles per cluster , at least , for small @xmath1 ( as we shall see , 60 particles correspond to @xmath23 ) .",
    "altogether , at redshift @xmath24 , we shall therefore span a @xmath1 interval ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26mpc .",
    "cluster clustering has been studied by various authors in simulations . in particular , the behaviour of @xmath27 , for standard cdm and open cdm , was studied by bahcall & cen ( 1992 ) , watanabe et al ( 1994 ) , croft & efstathiou ( 1994 ) , eke et al ( 1996 ) , croft et al ( 1997 ) , governato et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "their results allow to conclude that cdm models with @xmath10 may approach the observed behaviour of @xmath27 , only for @xmath28 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath27 in a mixed model was also studied , using pm simulations , by klypin & rhee ( 1994 ) and walter and klypin ( 1996 ) .",
    "their work treated a different mix from those considered here , using smaller box and resolution .",
    "accordingly , they could inspect only the @xmath1 interval running from @xmath25 to 45@xmath9mpc .",
    "the behaviour they found is only marginally consistent with a constant @xmath29 ratio , but their model does not exhibit much improvement in respect to pure cdm .",
    "the mixed models we consider here were selected on the basis of recent tests on @xmath30 flavour mixing , which seem to support a non  vanishing @xmath30mass . mixing data come from the solar @xmath30 deficit ( see , e.g. , hampel et al 1996 , for gallex , and abdurashitov et al 1996 , for sage ) , the atmospheric @xmath30 anomaly ( fukuda et al 1994 ) and the lsnd experiment ( athanassopoulos et al 1995 ) on @xmath30 s arising from @xmath31 and @xmath32 decay .",
    "barger , weiler & whisnant ( 1998 ) and sarkar ( 1999 ) show that all above results can agree if a fourth sterile @xmath30 exists , which can be however added without harming bbns or lep standard results .",
    "diagonalizing the mass matrix , they eventually obtain the four @xmath30mass eigenvalues , which split into two nearly degenerate pairs , corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath341.5 ev .",
    "it must be outlined that , within this picture , there remains no contradiction among different experimental results , at variance with earlier analyses which seemed to find contradictions between lsnd and other @xmath30mixing results .    in a cosmological context , however , mixed models have been considered since long .",
    "the transfer function for several mixed models was first computed by bonometto & valdarnini ( 1984 ) .",
    "results on mixed models were then found by a number of authors ( see , e.g. , achilli , occhionero & scaramella 1985 , valdarnini & bonometto 1985 , holtzmann 1989 , for results obtainable from the linear theory , and davis et al 1992 , klypin et al 1993 , ghigna et al 1994 , for early simulations ) .",
    "after the release of lsnd data , primack et al ( 1995 ) performed simulations of models with 2 massive @xmath30 s and yielding @xmath35 and found that such mixture eased some problems met by greater @xmath36 models .",
    "the possibility of considering mixed models together with blue spectra ( primeval spectral index @xmath37 ) was first considered by liddle et al ( 1996 ) and lucchin et al ( 1996 ) . in the former paper ,",
    "blue mixed models able to fit all linear and analytical constraints were shown to exist . in the latter paper ,",
    "inflationary models leading to blue spectra were discussed and results of an n  body simulation of blue mixed models were reported .",
    "unfortunately , the model considered violated some observational constraints .",
    "a systematic study of blue mixed models was recently performed by bonometto & pierpaoli ( 1998 ) and pierpaoli & bonometto ( 1999 ) , selecting those consistent with cmb data and data predictable from the linear theory .    in the next section",
    "we show that the models considered here , on the basis of @xmath30physics motivation , are also suitable to fulfill the main observational constraints . in   3 we review the technique used to simulate their non  linear evolution . in   4",
    "we describe how clusters are selected in simulations .",
    "then , in   5 we describe how the 2point correlation function and its error estimates were worked out . in  6 , we will show the main results of the @xmath38 behaviour derived from fits to the 2point functions .",
    " 7 is devoted to discussion of the results and the main conclusions we derived from this work .",
    "the mixed models discussed in this paper were already considered in a previous work by gardini , bonometto & murante ( 1999 ; hereafter paper i ) they are models with two equal  mass massive @xmath30 s , selected by requiring agreement with data which can be fitted using the linear theory .",
    "more in detail , we required , first of all , agreement with observations at top and bottom scales , i.e. with cobe data and with the observed damped lyman@xmath6 system ( dlas ) abundance ( storrie  lombardi et al .",
    "assuming 2 massive @xmath30 s with @xmath39ev , we adjusted the spectral index @xmath40 so to agree with the above top and bottom data , choosing the minimum allowed value for the spectral amplitude ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "over intermediate scales , the main constraints to be tested are at 8 and 25@xmath9mpc , where we evaluated the mass variances @xmath42 ( see below ) . from such values",
    "we can work out the expected spectral slope and cluster abundance ( again , see below ) ; comparing their values with observations we see that @xmath43 values up to @xmath44ev can be considered , without violating such constraints .",
    "accordingly , we considered two values for the hot  dark  matter ( hdm ) density parameter @xmath36 , yielding @xmath43 at the top and bottom of the allowed interval .",
    "a cdm model , selected so to fit the same data in a similar way , was also studied , for the sake of comparison .",
    "while mixed models require @xmath45 , even with low @xmath41 , cdm may fit cobe data only if @xmath46 .",
    "model parameters are shown in detail in table i , while fig .",
    "1 shows the spectra obtained from the linear transfer function @xmath47 against apm reconstructed spectral points ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath48 is related to the comoving length scale @xmath49 and to the mass scale @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the present density of the universe . in fig .  1 also",
    "other data and results are shown , which will be discussed below .",
    "the tcdm model approximates the apm galaxy spectrum slightly better than the standard cdm ( scdm ) , thanks to its increased slope .",
    "however , it lays still quite below the spectral points around the peak at @xmath52mpc@xmath53 ( comoving length @xmath54120@xmath9mpc ) .",
    "blue mixed models , instead , show a stronger spectral peak , occurring where @xmath30 free streaming bends a primeval spectrum steeper than zeldovich .",
    "this causes a steeper downward spectrum for @xmath55mpc@xmath56mpc , which might be related to the reasons why blue mixed models approach the @xmath27 behaviour up to large @xmath1 .",
    "mass variances are defined according to the relation @xmath57 with a top  hat window function @xmath58 and @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the comoving horizon distance . using eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) we estimate the parameter @xmath61 which , only for pure cdm models , is often approximated as @xmath62 ( see efstathiou et al ( 1992 ) . peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) , using apm data , and borgani et al .",
    "( 1994 ) using abell / aco samples , constrained @xmath8 within the ( 2@xmath63 ) intervals 0.190.27 and 0.180.25 respectively .",
    "this parameter therefore tests the spectral slope above cluster mass scales .",
    "values of @xmath5 are directly related to the expected cluster number densities .",
    "a direct fit of data with simulations , for the cluster mass function , is given in paper i , where , however , a different definition of cluster mass was used .",
    "this point will be discussed again below and will be deepened in a forthcoming work .",
    "the three simulations considered here were already used in paper i , to which we refer for details .",
    "they were performed using a parallel n  body code , based upon the serial public ap3 m code of couchman ( 1991 ) , extended in order to treat variable mass particle sets and used varying the time  steps , when needed .",
    "we considered a box of side @xmath64mpc ( @xmath65 is the hubble parameters in units of 100 km@xmath66 ) ; here cdm+baryons were represented by @xmath67 particles , whose individual mass is @xmath68 for tcdm .",
    "mixed models also involve 2 massive @xmath30 s with @xmath69ev and 1.63@xmath70ev , to yield @xmath4 and 0.14 ( mdm1 and mdm2 , respectively ) .",
    "hence , _ slow _ particles , representing cdm+baryons , have masses @xmath71 with @xmath72 and 0.86 , respectively , while _ fast _ particles , representing hdm , have masses @xmath73 ( the ratio 2:1 between fast and slow particle numbers is required to set initial conditions with locally vanishing linear momentum ) .",
    "our force resolution can be reported to a plummer  equivalent smoothing parameter @xmath74kpc .",
    "the comoving force and mass resolutions approach the limits of the computational resources of the machine we used ( an hp exemplar spp2000 x class processor of the cilea consortium at segrate ",
    "the numerical resolution of our simulations were similar to other simulations of pure cdm , with different initial conditions performed by colberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , thomas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , cole et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and governato et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "mixed model simulations with a comparable dynamical range , instead , have only been performed by gross et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but in a smaller volume .",
    "different criteria can be used to select clusters in simulations . in paper",
    "i , we identified clusters as virialized haloes . here",
    "we shall give results obtained with a cluster definition aimed to approach more closely their observational definition .",
    "however , we widely tested and compared results ensuing different definitions , and a comprehensive discussion of the fit between particle sets obtained with various criteria will be published elsewhere .",
    "let us however state that 2point function outputs are fairly robust ; although specific values of the clustering length @xmath0 , at various @xmath1 , have even significant variations , when the cluster definition is changed , the general trend is always preserved : the mixed models discussed here however fit observational data .",
    "we shall illustrate this point with a few examples , without giving outputs for whole sets of different cluster definitions .    in order to approach the observational pattern , here clusters",
    "were found with a spherical overdensity ( so ) algorithm , based on a fixed sphere radius @xmath75mpc .",
    "the details of the procedure are close to those suggested by croft & efstathiou ( 1994 ) and klypin & rhee ( 1994 ) .",
    "hence , effects arising from the limiting magnitude of ( observational ) samples , border effects and projection effects are not included .",
    "( also the sphere radius is fixed to mimic the abell cluster definition ; clusters found in the apm survey were selected also with smaller @xmath76 .",
    "our simulations were also used to test whether systematic effects arise from a different choice of @xmath76 ; the differences we found have no significant impact on the results that will be shown here . )    more in detail , we start the procedure with a fof algorithm , which finds sets of @xmath77 cdm  baryon particles closer than @xmath78 times the average inter  particle separation .",
    "results reported here are obtained using @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "centers  of  mass ( cm ) of fof groups are then inspected as possible centers for so .",
    "starting from them , we follow an iterative procedure : cdm  baryon particles within a distance @xmath76 from cm and their cm are found ; this is repeated until we reach a stable particle set and fix their cm .",
    "only particle sets containing at least 25 particles are however kept .",
    "when , during the iterative procedure , two spheres intersect , only the most massive particle set is kept .",
    "our procedure aims to find _ all _ clusters above a suitable mass scale .",
    "loose requirements were therefore set on @xmath78 , in order to explore any possible matter condensation ; the dependence of our results on @xmath77 was also tested . reducing @xmath77 obviously leads to more fof groups and a number of them survives the iteration procedure defined hereabove .",
    "most of such _ extra  clusters _ , however , do not contain many particles . the result of such tests can be summarized by stating that _ extra  clusters _ of more than @xmath81 particles , found lowering @xmath77 down to 12 , are less than @xmath82 , in all cases ; this percentage has no further increase when still lower @xmath77 are taken .",
    "henceforth , for @xmath83 , i.e. , for @xmath84 , our cluster samples can be considered complete . in fig .  2",
    ", we show the relation between cluster masses and @xmath1 values , both at @xmath24 and at @xmath85 .    among other tests",
    ", we also verified the size of virialized haloes contained in clusters , as a function of their mass @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 be the radius encompassing a sphere , whereinside the density contrast is 180 , found starting from the cm of each cluster , but whose actual center is attained through a suitable number of iterations , so to be the cm of all particles within @xmath87 from it .",
    "let then @xmath88 be the mass of all cdm+baryon particles within @xmath87 . for large clusters",
    ", @xmath87 may exceed @xmath76 ; when @xmath86 is approximately @xmath89 , in general it is @xmath90 . in fig .",
    "3 we show the values of @xmath88 , as a function of @xmath86 , for tcdm .",
    "the trend is quite similar for mixed models .",
    "although @xmath88 tends to increase with @xmath86 , the trend is clearly not monotonic ; this is due to the spread of the values we find for @xmath87 at any @xmath86 . in spite of that ,",
    "for @xmath91 , all clusters contain a virialized halo .",
    "however , if we order by mass the cluster set , using @xmath88 instead of @xmath86 , we find a different result .",
    "hence , cluster sets , whose mean distance is @xmath1 , are different if we use @xmath88 instead of @xmath86 . it is then significant to compare the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 for the two different orderings . in paper",
    "i , clusters were given @xmath88 as mass ; such definition is farther from observational criteria , but is likely to be closer to physical requirements , e.g. , if we aim to compare simulation outputs with the expectations of a press & schechter approach .",
    "herebelow , in a few cases , we shall test how the clustering length depends on @xmath1 , when @xmath88 replaces @xmath86 . as we shall see , outputs depend significantly on the model , but are substantially independent from the cluster definition .",
    "using clusters in our simulation box , ordered according to their @xmath86 , we computed the 2point correlation function @xmath92 , for a set of @xmath1 values , by applying the estimator @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the number of cluster pairs in the radial bin of volume @xmath95 , centered on @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the box volume .",
    "error bars for @xmath92 were estimated using the standard bootstrapping procedure .",
    "( we checked the convergence of the estimator of the standard deviation evaluated from bootstrap realizations , by inspecting the third moment of the bootstrap distribution . in all cases ,",
    "convergence was attained when the number of bootstrap realizations matched the number of points in the catalogues ; see e.g. @xcite ) we compared such errors with the usual poisson errors , which were found to be systematically smaller by a factor @xmath98 .",
    "we then performed two different fits to a power law @xmath99 over the distance range 5@xmath9mpc@xmath100mpc : ( i ) a _ constrained _ fit , assuming a constant @xmath101 .",
    "for the sake of example , in fig .",
    "4 we show such fit for @xmath102mpc .",
    "\\(ii ) an _ unconstrained _ fit , allowing both @xmath0 and @xmath103 to vary .",
    "points were weighted by the corresponding bootstrap errors and @xmath0 best  fit values are also given with bootstrap errors .",
    "such errors are obviously smaller for the constrained fit , where our ignorance on @xmath103 is hidden . in general ,",
    "large @xmath1 clusters yield best fit @xmath103 values approaching 2 , although 1.8 lays always within 1@xmath63 .",
    "our @xmath0 estimates are performed at @xmath24 and @xmath85 , to inspect cluster clustering evolution .",
    "in fig .  5 we report the @xmath38 behaviour for tcdm , mdm1 and mdm2 , for fixed @xmath101 .",
    "6 we give results for the same cases , obtained with 2parameters fits on @xmath0 and @xmath103 .",
    "errors bars represent @xmath104 bootstrap errors ( see  3 ) . of course",
    ", error bars are smaller in the single parameter fits , where our ignorance on @xmath103 is hidden .",
    "together with the @xmath0 values obtained from our simulations we also plot apm and abell cluster data , the bw conjecture , and the results from simulations performed by bahcall & cen ( 1992 ) and croft & efstathiou ( 1994 ) .",
    "recent results obtained by governato et al ( 1999 ) , for a critical cdm model , lay between the last two curves .",
    "observational points and error bars given in our figures were obtained from original work .",
    "we draw the reader s attention on the fact that , in some recent work studying cluster clustering in simulations , observational points and error bars are not accurately reported .",
    "a comparison of tcdm with data , shows that simulated and apm data points are in fair agreement . in view of",
    "the better fits obtainable with mixed models , shown in the same figures , one might tend to overlook the improvement of tcdm in respect to cdm models with @xmath10 , which , instead , is significant .",
    "our tcdm model , however , seems to miss systematically the abell catalog points and , thence , is far from the bw conjecture , which tries to set a compromise between abell and apm results .    from this point of view , the performance of mixed models is better . for low @xmath1",
    ", mdm1 tends to give @xmath0 values above the bw conjecture ( see , however , lee & park 1999 ) . a similar , but less pronounced , effect exists also for mdm2 . on intermediate scales",
    "mdm1 sticks on the bw conjecture curve and meets two of the apm points at the 2@xmath105 level only .",
    "mdm2 , instead , seems to try to compromise between apm and abell points . on top scales , the behaviours shown here by the two models are opposite .",
    "the mdm1 behaviour , at such scales , seems however somehow anomalous ; such scales are those which are most likely affected by cosmic variance and the mdm1 behaviour at @xmath106@xmath107mpc should certainly be tested with different model realizations . furthermore , unconstrained fits tend to indicate that such discrepancy arises from different correlation function slopes",
    ".    it may also be significant to consider the unconstrained fit obtained ordering clusters according to @xmath88 masses , which is shown in fig .",
    "let us notice that : ( i ) in most cases , error bars are smaller ; ( ii ) the peculiar feature for mdm1 at large @xmath1 has disappeared .",
    "it is likely that such improvement is related to a more direct physical significance of the mass @xmath88 and the ( variable ) radius @xmath87 .",
    "taking a fixed radius @xmath76 , instead , risks to accentuate a dependence on local peculiar features . in principle , this is more likely to occur for small mass clusters , for which significant volumes , still unaffected by virialization processes , lay within @xmath76 . in our simulation volume",
    ", however , we have a large deal of low  mass clusters and this allows an efficient averaging over local realizations . at the top mass end , instead , the sample is more restricted and we must mostly rely on the virialization process , rather than on sample averaging , to smear off local peculiarities .",
    "our results seem to indicate that significant memory of initial conditions is kept also below @xmath87 .    in fig.s [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ]",
    "we report a comparison between the 2point function results at @xmath24 and @xmath85 , obtained using @xmath86 .",
    "unconstrained fits at @xmath85 are rather noisy at large @xmath1 , in particular for top scales . constrained fits , instead ,",
    "might be taken as an indication of clustering evolution on top scales . here ,",
    "perhaps , there is a further evidence of anomaly in mdm1 , which is the only case when clustering seems however weeker at @xmath24 than at @xmath85 .",
    "apparently , all models seem to indicate a greater clustering length at scales between 50 and 6570@xmath9mpc for @xmath85 .",
    "apart of mdm1 , instead , this is inverted above 70@xmath9mpc .",
    "fig [ fig10 ] , instead , shows results on cluster evolution based on @xmath88 ordering and using constrained fits .",
    "the kind of evolution found hereabove seems confirmed , while mdm1 anomaly is reduced .",
    "previous numerical results on cluster clustering , based on models with @xmath21 , gave a behaviour of @xmath27 a few @xmath105 s below observational results .",
    "the only exception are bahcall & cen ( 1992 ) , whose numerical study involves peculiar extrapolations and however succeeds to meet two apm points at large @xmath1 only .",
    "when considering subcritical cdm models ( ocdm ) , the same authors obtain a behaviour close to the bw conjecture . however ,",
    "this is not fully confirmed by later numerical studies ; although they clearly indicate that , in ocdm models , the @xmath1 dependence on @xmath0 is consistent with apm points , abell cluster points seem to require a still steeper dependence than in ocdm .",
    "such findings , however , were currently interpreted as an indication that observational data on cluster clustering may be approached only by models with @xmath28 and led to arguing that the observed dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath13 is somehow related to an early cluster formation .    the behaviour we find for tcdm does not support such kind of inference . taking a spectral index",
    "@xmath108 has no substantial effect on the time of cluster formation , which is quite similar to standard cdm . in view of the more stricking outputs for mixed models",
    ", we must not disregard the result we find for tcdm .",
    "the @xmath27 behaviour of clusters in such model is analogous to previous outputs for ocdm and lays well above the very behaviour obtained by bahcall & cen ( 1992 ) for standard cdm .",
    "our findings are that , taking @xmath109 , the clustering of clusters in an @xmath21 model approaches the behaviour obtained from apm cluster data .",
    "even more striking is the cluster clustering behaviour for the mixed models considered in this work , which are based on low mass @xmath30 s . in this case",
    ", the slope of the @xmath27 behaviour approaches the bw conjecture and , more significantly , within 1 or 2@xmath105 bootstrap error bars , we mostly find consistency both with apm and abell results .",
    "the only exception could be the point of abell clusters of richness @xmath110 , which is approached only by mdm2 .",
    "our results , however , support previous claims that , at the top mass end , wider samples may be required to suppress the cosmic variance .",
    "quite in general , it can be reasonable to consider cluster clustering as a measure of the spectral power on scales exceeding @xmath111mpc .",
    "all models with @xmath21 ought to have similar values of @xmath5 , in order to be consistent with the observed cluster abundance . accordingly",
    ", the power at scales @xmath111mpc is basically gauged by the value of the @xmath8 parameter .",
    "it may not be a case that models perform in a better way as their @xmath8 s approach the observational interval .",
    "surely , in the case of mixed models , the situation is complicated by the presence of a hot component , which may slow down the gravitational growth in the non  linear regime , in a scale  dependent fashion .",
    "previous results for mixed models concerned a mix including 30@xmath112 of hdm , due to a single @xmath30 with mass @xmath113ev . here",
    "we deal with @xmath30 s 34 times lighter ; accordingly , when cluster formation begins , their speeds are @xmath1144 times greater .",
    "peculiar effects of mdm are therefore significantly reinforced .",
    "hence , besides of having a suitable spectral slope , the mixed models treated here are still more different from standard cdm , because of the late @xmath30 derelativisation .",
