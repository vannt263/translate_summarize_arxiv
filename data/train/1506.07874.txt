    "the abundances of neutron - capture elements in globular clusters ( gc ) provide additional insight , beyond the light elements o , na , and al , into the origin of abundance anomalies found among stars in a given cluster .",
    "in particular , finding gc stars with unusual enhancements of elements produced by the s - process enables a direct comparison with theoretical yield predictions .",
    "for example , comparing the ratio of light ( first peak ) to heavy ( second peak ) s - process elements provides information about the mass and metallicity of the stars in which the s - process elements were produced .",
    "most s - process elements are produced through one of two channels .",
    "the main channel takes place in @xmath5 asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars where neutrons are released in a @xmath6c(@xmath7)@xmath8n(@xmath9c(@xmath10)@xmath11o reaction occurring in a @xmath8c - enriched pocket . the size and efficiency of the @xmath8c - pocket , and in turn the outcome of the main s - process , is not currently well - constrained , but the @xmath8c - pocket is likely located in the he - intershell region and driven by carbon created in the stellar interior and protons from the outer h - rich layers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several theoretical studies have shown that m@xmath12 agb stars may produce the largest fractional yield of main s - process material peaking around 2@xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in more massive stars ,",
    "the weak s - process is thought to be the dominant slow neutron - capture process , and the neutron source is a @xmath14ne(@xmath10)@xmath15 mg reaction that is only activated at higher densities and temperatures ( t@xmath16k ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while the main s - process produces a larger fraction of second - peak neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , ba and la ) , the weak s - process tends to produce a higher fraction of first - peak ( e.g. , sr , y , and zr ) s - process elements @xcite .",
    "the gc 47  tuc is a useful candidate for analyzing neutron - capture production because it is nearby , massive , metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath3 ) , and has been spectroscopically studied in great detail .",

    "thus , s - process enhanced stars are relatively rare in monometallic gcs .",
    "interestingly , these s - process rich stars tend to be found in the external regions of gcs , which could be a consequence of less efficient binary disruption , assuming these s - process rich stars formed in binary systems .",
    "therefore , in the present work we perform a detailed abundance analysis of lee  4710 , an s - process enhanced star in 47  tuc .",
    "we aim to assess whether or not the star s heavy element composition can be modeled by theoretical agb yields , and also explore possible formation modes .",

    "the abundance of all elements except fe were computed using spectrum synthesis .",

    "since we could not measure c or n independently , we assumed [ c / fe]@xmath23 and [ n / fe]@xmath24 following @xcite , and adjusted the [ n / fe ] to match the strength of nearby cn features in our spectra .",

    "similarly , the large [ x / fe ] ratios found for elements with z@xmath130 in lee  4710 ( see table  [ tab : abundances ] ) lead us to believe that this star experienced significant s - process pollution from an external source .",

    "instead , the star - to - star [ ba , la / fe ] dispersion found for stars with generally low [ ba , la / eu ] ratios may be a reflection of primordial variations and/or incomplete mixing of gas within the early cluster environment .",
    "in fact , heavy element dispersions ranging from a factor of @xmath66 due to primordial r - process inhomogeneities alone have already been detected in some clusters @xcite .",

    "[ fig : radialla ] ) .          since lee  4710 exhibits larger [ ba , la / fe ] excesses compared to [ y , zr / fe ]",
    ", we expect that the star was polluted by the main s - process operating in a low to intermediate mass agb star .",
    "we can rule out that lee  4710 is a thermally pulsing agb star given both its location on the color - magnitude diagram ( 2.5 mag .",
    "below the rgb - tip ) and the fact that as a co - eval cluster member it would not have a high enough mass to be an intrinsic ba - star .",
    "thus , we believe that the s - process enrichment originates from a former agb binary companion ( see also sect .  [",
    "sec : binary ] ) . in order to better trace the possible origin of the s - process enrichment of lee  4710",
    ", we can compare the star s stellar abundance pattern to theoretical yields from similar metallicity agb stars of different masses .",
    "in this connection we note that detailed , isotopic abundances of c and n in lee  4710 would help us unveil the nature of its enrichment or mixing events , since dredge - up episodes would increase the @xmath8c and n abundances and lead to a low c / n - ratio .",
    "figure  [ fig : yields ] shows a comparison of the heavy element abundances derived for lee  4626 ( s - process poor ) and lee  4710 ( s - process rich ) against theoretical yields from the f.r.u.i.t.y database @xcite for m@xmath68 , and @xmath69 agb stars . using these data , we find that for lee  4710 the abundance pattern of elements with @xmath70 is best fit by the 1.3@xmath13 model .",
    "the @xmath71 , and @xmath72 agb models produce [ x / fe ] ratios that are @xmath180.5 dex too large to match the observations .",
    "although we note that the present - day surface composition of lee  4710 may not entirely reflect the abundance pattern of the material accreted while the star was on the main - sequence , any dilution of accreted material due to rgb evolution is unlikely to change the heavy element abundances by 0.5dex or more , and we therefore believe that a low - mass agb star ( @xmath731.5@xmath13 ) is most likely to provide the best fit ( even after some pollution or dilution of the transferred material ) .",
    "the [ y / fe ] and [ zr / fe ] abundances are also enhanced in lee  4710 compared to lee  4626 , and these elements are better fit by the 1.5@xmath13 agb model compared to the more massive agb models .",
    "however , these elements may also have a production component from the weak neutron - capture processes and therefore , at least in 47  tuc , the lighter elements may not be as useful for constraining the masses of individual agb polluters .",
    "a simple tracer of s - process production is the ratio of the heavy - to - light elements , which is annotated as [ hs / ls ] where hs is the average of [ ba / fe ] , [ la / fe ] , [ nd / fe ] , and [ sm / fe ] and ls is the average of [ sr / fe ] , [ y / fe ] , and [ zr / fe ] . as a rule of thumb , the lighter s - process elements , such as sr ",
    "zr , can be created by the weak s - process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in more massive stars .",
    "the weak s - process is predicted to produce moderate amounts of light s - nuclei and only a small amount of the heavy s - elements .",
    "this in turn results in a negative [ hs / ls ] .",
    "however , such a negative ratio can also be produced by agb stars if they have not undergone many pulses or if the seed - to - neutron ratio is high ( i.e. , a high metallicity ) .",
    "similarly , an agb star that experiences many thermal pulses and dredge - up episodes or has a low seed - to - neutron ratio ( low metallicity ) will produce a positive [ hs / ls ] ratio .",
    "@xcite find a [ hs / ls ] of @xmath74 to @xmath75 , which on our abundance scale ( and [ fe / h ] ) corresponds to @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "these values match those we derive for lee  4626 , which shows a normal la abundance . on the other hand",
    ", lee  4710 has a [ hs / ls ] of + 0.33 .",
    "this large value almost matches the total [ hs / ls]-ratio of a 1.3@xmath13 agb star ( z=0.006 ) after all dredge - ups ( a total of four episodes ) have been completed .",
    "we note that if the metallicity was slightly higher , then the observed [ hs / ls ] of lee  4710 would agree with the 1.3@xmath13 agb ( z=0.003 ) yield after just two dredge - up episodes . with the high [ hs / ls ] of lee  4710 , the weak s - process is therefore not likely to explain the formation of this star , whereas a few or even all dredge - up episodes of a 1.3@xmath13 agb can plausibly explain the heavy element enrichment found in lee  4710 .",
    "understanding the mechanism responsible for the s - process pattern of star lee  4710 will shed light on its chemical enrichment and indirectly may provide some insight regarding dynamical differences between the inner and outer regions of 47  tuc .",
    "a commonly adopted explanation for the creation of extrinsic ba - stars is mass transfer in a binary system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this scenario , a more massive companion produces s - process elements through third dredge - up episodes that are later accreted onto the surface of the lower mass , and more slowly evolving , companion .",
    "the old age of 47  tuc ( 11.75@xmath780.25 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) stars provides more than enough time for a @xmath2 star to evolve through the agb phase and be responsible for the heavy element abundance pattern of lee  4710 .",
    "as noticed by @xcite , four out of five ba - rich stars in their sample ( @xmath171200 stars ) are primordial population stars , similar to lee  4710 .",
    "this finding is consistent with the greater predicted survival rates for binaries in the primordial population of 47  tuc , and would allow the binary system to survive long enough for the original primary star to reach the agb phase and transfer s - process enhanced material onto its companion .",
    "the fact that all nine s - process enriched stars found in 47  tuc are far from the center of the cluster suggests that the outer regions may provide more favorable conditions for binary systems to survive and for mass transfer to occur .",
    "this scenario is supported by @xcite who claims that at an age of 5 gyr , when the putative agb companion transferred mass , 75% of the binaries in the first generation population survived . at 47  tuc s current age ,",
    "@xmath79% of these still survive .",
    "although omega cen is known to have a large population of stars highly enriched in s - process elements , [ s - process / fe]@xmath80 @xcite , large s - process enhancements are an uncommon characteristic among most gcs .",
    "enhancements in s - process elements in gcs typically do not exceed [ ba , la / fe]=0.6dex and have been found only in a limited number of more metal - poor clusters ( [ fe / h]@xmath81 ) : m4 @xcite , ngc  1851 @xcite , m22 @xcite , m2 @xcite , and ngc  6864 @xcite . from published samples of s - process elements ( @xmath17200 stars ) we find that nine stars are s - process enriched in 47  tuc , i.e. @xmath174%@xmath782% . within the errors ,",
    "this number is consistent with 47  tuc s small binary fraction ( 1.8@xmath82@xmath780.6@xmath82 , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are two caveats that prevent assessing whether mass transfer in a binary system is the only mechanism responsible for the s - process rich stars in 47  tuc .",
    "firstly , @xcite determined the fraction of binaries in 47  tuc within 2.5 arcmin ; therefore , in the outermost regions where the s - process rich stars have been found , the binary fraction could be different .",
    "@xcite suggest that the first generation binary fraction increases as a function of distance from the center .",
    "secondly , the current binary fraction could be slightly smaller than it was when the s - rich stars were produced due to dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "multi - epoch spectroscopic follow - up with several months between the observation is needed to determine whether some of these nine s - process rich stars currently belong to a binary system with an unseen wd or post - agb companion .",
    "these observations should also be accompanied by a determination of c , n , and @xmath6c/@xmath8c abundances that may help to further constrain any agb mass transfer scenarios .",
