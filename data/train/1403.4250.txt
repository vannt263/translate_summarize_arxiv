    "although exposures of sn  2014j were acquired for the minimum possible integration time , the number of counts registered by the several pixels closest to the peak of the psf exceeded the range within which the detector has a linear response . both to register the  ao exposures and then to measure the coordinates of the psf of sn  2014j , we needed to determine the center of the psf of the sn .",
    "we therefore fit a two - dimensional gaussian model to the sn pixel intensity distribution in each of the  exposures and allowed the psf center coordinates , fwhm , and normalization to vary .",

    "we create a sequence of images , each with a superimposed artificial point source having fwhm appropriate to the _ hst _ instrument and bandpass filter .",
    "we create a pixelated gaussian psf and use the pyfits package to add the artificial source to the _ hst _ image .",

    "the artificial point source in each successive image contains 0.1  mag additional flux than that in the previous image .",

    "we consider a 3@xmath12 detection to be one for which the source flux exceeds the background rms inside a 6-pixel aperture by a factor of 3 .",
    "a circular aperture enclosing 80% of the flux of a point source is the default choice for most _ hst _ instruments when computing the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of a flux measurement using the exposure time calculator ( etc ) . for the acs wide field camera ( wfc )",
