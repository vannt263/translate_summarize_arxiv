    "classical novae ( cne ) eruptions are thermonuclear runaways ( tnr ) on the surface of a white dwarf that has been accreting material from a low mass companion for millennia .",
    "townsley & bildsten ( 2004 ) show that for systems with mass accretion rates of @xmath2 = 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 , ignition of the tnr can occur once the accumulated envelope on the white dwarf exceeds 10@xmath7 m@xmath5 .",
    "the resulting eruption can surpass the eddington limit , and eject @xmath8 10@xmath9 m@xmath5 of nuclear processed material at high velocity .",
    "the eruptions of cne provide tests of our understanding of tnrs , the nucleosynthesis that occurs within the burning layers ( e.g. , starrfield et al .",
    "2009 ) , and the factors that drive the outburst luminosity and shell ejection process ( e.g. , shaviv 2001 ) .",
    "all cne are cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "cvs can be separated into two broad classes : magnetic , and non - magnetic .",
    "magnetic cvs harbor white dwarfs that have field strengths of b @xmath10 1 mg , while the field strengths for the white dwarfs in non - magnetic cvs are believed to be considerably smaller ( though see warner 2004 ) .",
    "in addition , magnetic cvs are further subdivided into two subclasses : polars , and `` intermediate polars '' ( ips ) .",
    "ips are believed to have lower magnetic field strengths ( b @xmath11 7 mg ) , than polars .",
    "ips are identified by having coherent periodicities that are shorter than their orbital periods , believed to originate from processes occurring near the magnetic poles of the rapidly rotating white dwarfs in these systems . in polars ,",
    "the stronger field captures the accretion stream close to the secondary star and funnels it onto the magnetic poles of the white dwarf .",
    "both the primary and secondary stars in polars are phase - locked to rotate at the orbital period .    that there are magnetic cvs among the old novae is already well known with such famous cne such as dq her , v603 aql , and gk per being classified as ips .",
    "whether there are true polars among the cne has not yet been fully answered .",
    "the best case for the latter is v1500 cyg .",
    "stockman et al .",
    "( 1988 ) showed that v1500 cyg exhibits strong , orbitally modulated circular polarization that they suggested comes from high - harmonic cyclotron emission .",
    "v1500 cyg is slightly asynchronous , so it is not currently a true polar , but schmidt & stockman ( 1991 ) suggest it will return to synchronism within @xmath12 150 yrs .",
    "another likely highly magnetic cn is v2214 oph .",
    "baptista et al . ( 1993 ) compare its visual light curve to the proto - type polar am her ( crampton & cowley 1977 , campbell et al .",
    "the similarity is striking , and it is difficult to envision how such a light curve could be produced by a source other than cyclotron emission .",
    "v1500 cyg was a remarkable cn , having one of the largest outburst amplitudes ( @xmath13 m @xmath12 19.2 mag , warner 1985 ) , and one of the most rapid declines from visual maximum ever observed ( @xmath14 = 3.7 d ; downes & duerbeck 2000 , strope et al .",
    "expansion parallax measures give a distance of 1.5 kpc ( slavin et al .",
    "1995 ) to v1500 cyg , and thus an absolute magnitude at maximum of m@xmath15 = @xmath1610.7 .",
    "the only other cn that rivals this luminosity is cp pup , an object that warner ( 1985 ) shows has acted in a similar fashion to v1500 cyg . both of these objects appear to have had outbursts that were much more luminous than that of gk per ( m@xmath15 = @xmath169.4 ) , the most luminous cn for which a high precision parallax has been derived ( harrison et al .",
    "2013a ) .",
    "v1500 cyg is also unusual in that it is only one of two cne that have been observed to have a dramatic pre - outburst rise , brightening by eight magnitudes in the eight months leading up to its eruption ( collazzi et al . 2009 ) .",
    "collazzi et al .",
    "also show that v1500 cyg is one of five cne ( of 22 ) that have remained much more luminous ( @xmath12 10@xmath17 ) after outburst , compared to their pre - eruption quiescent levels .",
    "this suggests that the accretion rate in v1500 cyg remains much higher than observed for typical cne , and thus , as discussed by wheeler ( 2012 ) , such objects are excellent progenitor candidates for type i supernovae .",
    "the question is whether the presence of a strong magnetic field played any role in the unusual outburst ( and current ) properties of v1500 cyg .",
    "theoretically , it is unclear if strong magnetic fields play any role in shaping the outburst of cne ( livio et al .",
    "1988 , nikitin et al .",
    "2000 ) , so the only way to know for sure is to identify and characterize more highly magnetic cne . we have obtained both infrared spectra and photometry of v1500 cyg , and a small set of other old cne to search for behavior that we can associate with the presence of a magnetic white dwarf primary . in the next section we describe our observations , in section 3 we present the infrared spectroscopy and photometry for the program objects , in section 4 we discuss our results , and draw our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in the following we present data from three separate observing runs using the near infrared camera ( `` nirc '' ) on keck 1 , the simultaneous quad infrared imaging device ( `` sqiid '' ) on the kpno 2.1 m , and the infrared imager ( `` irim '' ) on the kpno 2.1 m. in addition , we perform a new extraction of the @xmath18 photometry for cne from the 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and @xmath0 catalogs to allow us to put our observations in context , as well as explore the infrared colors of quiescent cne .",
    "we used nirc ( matthews & soifer 1994 ) on keck 1 on the nights of 2006 july 7 and 8 ut .",
    "nirc ( now retired ) used a 256 square insb array , with a pixel scale of 0.15 \" /pix .",
    "besides imaging in the standard near - infrared filters , nirc had three different grisms providing resolutions of r @xmath12 60 to 120 .",
    "these grisms allowed for the simultaneous observation of two adjoining infrared photometric bandpasses .",
    "we observed with the gr150 grism and the `` jh '' filter to obtain spectra covering the @xmath19- and @xmath20-bands , and with the gr120 grism and the `` hk '' filter to cover the @xmath20- and @xmath21-bands .",
    "note that simultaneous spectra covering @xmath18 were not possible , so separate filter / grism moves were necessary with a subsequent set of integrations , to obtain such spectra .",
    "the individual integration times on the old novae in our project were three minutes , except for hr lyr where two minute exposures were used .",
    "separate integrations were obtained at two different positions along the slit to allow for background subtraction .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the standard routines inside iraf . for wavelength calibration , the spectrum of the planetary nebula k",
    "3 - 60 was used .",
    "observations of a0v stars were obtained to provide telluric correction .",
    "the stronger h i lines intrinsic to the spectra of the a0v stars were patched - over using a simple linear fit , before division into our program object data .",
    "an observing log is presented in table 1 .",
    "the nirc spectra of four of the old novae are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "infrared photometry for fifteen objects was obtained using sqiid on the kpno 2.1 m. sqiid obtains @xmath18 images simultaneously .",
    "the observation log can be found in table 1 for the objects for which light curves were generated . to obtain sky - subtracted images ,",
    "all of the program objects were observed using an abba pattern , where an image is obtained at an initial position ( `` a '' ) , the telescope is then nodded ( @xmath12 20 \" ) to a second position ( `` b '' ) , before returning to the first position .",
    "data were flatfielded using the normal procedure , and differential aperture photometry was performed on the targets and four nearby field stars .",
    "the photometry , listed in table 2 , has been calibrated using the 2mass data for the field stars .",
    "the other targets with data appearing in table 2 ( and that were too faint to generate useful light curves ) were observed at various times during the 2006 july 10 to 15 observing run .",
    "irim , now retired , used a 256 square hgcdte nicmos3 array .",
    "we obtained data in the @xmath22 filters . unlike sqiid , images in each filter had to be obtained separately .",
    "data were flatfielded using the normal procedure , and differential aperture photometry was performed on the targets and several nearby bright stars .",
    "the photometry has been calibrated using the 2mass data for these stars , and is listed in table 2 .",
    "these targets ( t aur , v705 cas , v723 cas , dm gem , bt mon , and v400 per ) were observed on 1997 february 12 and 13 .      to examine the ir colors of old cne , we extracted the @xmath18 photometry of these objects from the 2mass point source catalog ( psc ) to allow us to make a comparison with our new observations .",
    "hoard et al . (",
    "2002 ) have previously completed a search of this catalog for cvs , and presented data for three dozen cne .",
    "we felt , however , that a re - extraction of the photometry for cne from the 2mass data base was warranted to determine if additional cne might have been missed in the hoard et al .",
    "we searched the psc for all old cne that had secure identifications in the on - line version of the downes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) catalog .",
    "we then used the 2mass survey images to verify that the source listed by the psc was consistent with the optical counterpart of the cn ( there were a significant number of cne where this was not the case ) .",
    "the 2mass i d for the correct psc counterpart is listed , along with the @xmath18 photometry , in table 3 .",
    "in addition to the objects found in a search of the psc , we extracted photometry for nine cne for which the psc does not list a source , but where there is clearly an object visible on the 2mass survey images consistent with the optical counterpart . while most of these objects are faint , not all of them are ( e.g. , v825 sco ) .",
    "the final tabulation of the 2mass photometry for 79 cne is listed in table 3 .",
    "all of the objects listed here erupted prior to the year 2001 , except v2467 cyg ( nova cygni 2007 ) .",
    "this cn was included because its mid - ir spectrum had been published ( helton et al .",
    "2012 ) , and those data provided context for the results discussed in section 4.2    table 3 also tabulates published values for the visual extinction for the detected cne .",
    "these values came from a wide variety of sources , using a wide variety of techniques .",
    "the determination of extinction for cne can be quite difficult , with values often ranging by a factor of two or more for the same nova .",
    "references to the sources for all of these extinction values are explicitly noted .",
    "values of a@xmath23 where multiple sources are cited are averages of the published values .",
    "an italicized value in the visual extinction column indicates an estimate made assuming that all cne have similar colors in quiescence .",
    "this latter topic will be fully addressed in section 4.1 .",
    "harrison et al . ( 2013b ) found that light curve data extracted from the @xmath0 `` all sky single exposure table '' were invaluable in showing that the infrared excesses of polars were due to strong , low - harmonic cyclotron emission . to their surprise , several polars they examined had large amplitude ( @xmath13 m @xmath10 0.6 mag ) variations in the @xmath0 bandpasses .",
    "thus , such data might provide additional insight into the objects under study here , and thus @xmath0 data for the program cne were extracted and examined when possible .",
    "the @xmath0 mission ( wright et al . 2010 ) surveyed the entire sky in four wavelength bands : 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath1 m .",
    "the two short bandpasses ( hereafter , `` w1 '' and `` w2 '' ) are quite similar to the two short @xmath24 irac bandpasses ( jarrett et al .",
    "the 12 @xmath1 m channel ( `` w3 '' , @xmath25 = 11.56 @xmath1 m ) , is similar to that of the @xmath26 12 @xmath1 m bandpass , while the 22 @xmath1 m ( `` w4 '' ; @xmath25 = 22.09 @xmath1 m ) bandpass closely resembles the @xmath24 mips 24 @xmath1 m channel ( jarrett et al .",
    "given that mid - ir observations of old cne might be feasible from the ground , or with @xmath27 , we decided to extract the @xmath0 data for all of the cne listed in table 3 .",
    "like for the 2mass extractions above , we insured that each detection listed in the @xmath0 all sky survey catalog was consistent with both the optical candidate , as well as the 2mass source for each object , by examining the actual @xmath0 images .",
    "the photometry for these objects is listed in table 4 . a significant fraction of the cne listed in table 4",
    "do not appear in the all sky survey catalog . to extract their fluxes , we downloaded the @xmath0 images , and used iraf aperture photometry to extract their fluxes using nearby , isolated bright stars to calibrate their magnitudes ( these objects have been identified in table 4 ) .",
    "due to the large pixel sizes inherent to the @xmath0 images , several objects suffer from blending issues with a nearby field star .",
    "the listed fluxes for those sources should be used with caution .",
    "there are a number of methods to conclusively show the presence of a magnetic white dwarf in a cv system . among these",
    "are orbitally modulated polarization ( e.g. , stockman et al . 1988 ) , the presence of zeeman - split absorption lines in the photosphere of the white dwarf primary ( e.g. , beuermann et al . 2007 ) , or the direct detection of emission from cyclotron harmonics using spectroscopy .",
    "examples of the latter have been presented by campbell et al .",
    "( 2008a , b , c ) .    secondarily , one can mount a circumstantial case ( as for v2214 oph ) using light curves that show `` polar - like '' variations .",
    "given the spacing of the cyclotron harmonics , there can be bandpasses where there is little cyclotron emission , while an adjacent bandpass is strongly affected .",
    "one example is am her , where the @xmath19-band is dominated by ellipsoidal variations from the secondary star , while the @xmath20 and @xmath21-bands are dominated by cyclotron emission ( see campbell et al .",
    "this is an excellent method that can be applied when the cv is too faint for phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "the majority of classical novae are generally too faint to obtain phase - resolved near - infrared spectroscopy to ascertain whether orbitally modulated cyclotron emission is present .",
    "however , the low resolution grism mode of nirc put many old novae within reach . to show what the spectra of two known polars look like with this instrument",
    ", we present the data for dp leo and eu uma in fig .",
    "2 . both of these objects are short period polars , having p@xmath28 @xmath8 90 min ( ramsay et al .",
    "2001 , ramsay et al .",
    "2004 ) . as of",
    "yet , there is no estimate of the magnetic field strength in eu uma , but dp leo has been reported to be a two - pole polar with b@xmath29 = 76 mg and b@xmath30 = 31 mg ( cropper & wickramasinghe 1993 ) .    at first glance , the nir spectrum of dp leo is unusual , showing peculiar , and strongly peaked @xmath19- and @xmath20-band continua .",
    "such a spectrum superficially resembles those of l - dwarfs , except the water vapor features and the @xmath21-band continuum seen in dp leo do not match such ( red ) objects .",
    "we feel that the best match for these features is an m6v . as fig .",
    "2 demonstrates , the comparison of the spectrum of dp leo to an m6v shows that it has strong excess emission in the @xmath19- and @xmath20-bands .",
    "a 31 mg field would have the @xmath31 = 2 and @xmath31 = 3 harmonics at 1.7 and 1.15 @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "this is where the greatest deviations from the m6v spectrum occur .",
    "thus , it is obvious that we have detected cyclotron emission from this object , and this shows the ability of nirc to detect this type of emission in our program objects .",
    "in contrast to dp leo , the nirc spectrum of eu uma does not have obvious cyclotron emission features and , like dp leo , the secondary star of eu uma appears to have a spectral type near m6v ( fig .",
    "2 ) . there are two broad emission features located at 1.09 and 1.30 @xmath1 m that are consistent with the locations of he i ( + h i pa@xmath32 ) and h i ( pa@xmath33 ) , respectively .",
    "given the low resolution of nirc , these features are somewhat broader than expected if they were simply due to emission lines from he i and h i. the @xmath19-band light curve of eu uma shows large variations ( @xmath34 1.5 mag ) , which is quite typical of polars ( fig .",
    "the observed minimum in the @xmath19-band light curve occurred at 03:51 ut on 2006 july 12 . extrapolating the ephemeris of eu uma back to the time of the nirc spectra ( 2006 july 8) ,",
    "shows that the @xmath19-band minimum would have occurred at 06:46 ut on that date .",
    "given that the jh spectra were obtained between 06:22 and 06:39 ut , indicates that these data were obtained close to the predicted time of a @xmath19-band minimum .",
    "thus , the weak emission features seen in the @xmath19-band could be due to an unfavorable viewing angle to the cyclotron source and , if so , are consistent with the @xmath31 = 6 and 7 harmonics for a field with b = 14 mg . with this field strength ,",
    "the @xmath31 = 3 , 4 , and 5 harmonics would lie at 1.52 , 1.91 , and 2.54 @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , our spectrum of eu uma is too poor to surmise whether these weak features exist .",
    "however , there is no evidence for similar minima in the @xmath20- and @xmath21-band light curves , and thus the evidence for near - ir cyclotron emission from eu uma is more ambiguous than that seen in dp leo .",
    "higher quality spectra and light curves will be needed to investigate this source further .",
    "v1500 cyg erupted in 1975 , had a large outburst amplitude , and was a very fast nova .",
    "a summary of the photometric observations of the outburst can be found in ennis et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , while ferland et al .",
    "( 1986 ) present the spectroscopic evolution . using photometric observations ,",
    "kaluzny & semeniuk ( 1987 ) assigned an orbital period of p@xmath28 = 3.35 hr .",
    "polarimetric observations by stockman et al .",
    "( 1988 ) found that the circular polarization of v1500 cyg varied over a period that was 1.8% shorter than the photometric period .",
    "they attributed this shorter period to the underlying rotation of a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "schmidt & stockman ( 1991 ) showed that this rotational period is slowly lengthening , and they suggested that v1500 cyg was an asynchronous polar that would return to synchronism in @xmath12 150 yr .",
    "as they noted , ( the approximately ) sinusoidal polarization curves that they observed for v1500 cyg are rarely seen in polars .",
    "they suggested that the best explanation for this behavior is that there is cyclotron emission from two separate poles on opposites sides of the white dwarf .",
    "the standard model for the behavior of circular polarization in polars suggest that it is maximized when the viewer is looking along the accretion column , and minimized when the accretion column is at right angles to the line - of - sight ( when linear polarization would dominate , see bailey et al .",
    "thus , at the time of zero circular polarization , both accretion columns are approximately located near the limb of the white dwarf .",
    "schmidt et al . ( 1995 ) provide an updated ephemeris for the rotation of the white dwarf , where `` magnetic phase 0 '' in this ephemeris continues to be defined as the time of the positive zero crossing of the circular polarization .",
    "we present the phase - resolved spectra of v1500 cyg obtained with nirc in fig .",
    "4 . due to the necessity of observing in either the `` jh '' or `` hk '' bands , simultaneous @xmath18 data are not possible . thus , on the first night ,",
    "a nearly complete ( 80% of an orbit ) phase - resolved jh data set was obtained , with sparser coverage with the hk grism on the second night .",
    "the spectra show dramatic evolution over an orbit , with weak emission lines near photometric phase zero , and very strong emission lines at phase 0.5 .",
    "the orbital phases in this plot were determined using the ( minimum light ) ephemeris of semeniuk et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "the nirc spectra suggest that near phase 0 , the emission line region is almost completely out of view . at the epoch of the @xmath35 nirc spectra ,",
    "the photometric and magnetic phases were essentially identical .",
    "as dramatic as the line evolution is over an orbit , the changing slope of the continuum is also quite apparent .",
    "schmidt et al . ( 1995 ) modeled phase resolved uv / optical spectroscopy of this source with an irradiated m star with t@xmath36 = 3,000 k , but that has a hot face with a temperature of 8,800 k. in fig .",
    "4 , we have plotted two blackbodies , one with a temperature of 8,800 k ( blue line ) , and a cooler one with t@xmath36 = 3,000 k. it is clear that neither of these matches the observed continuum very well at any orbital phase .",
    "in fact , the evolution of the spectra of v1500 cyg over an orbit are superficially similar to the phase resolved @xmath18 spectra of the polar vv pup in its high state ( campbell et al .",
    "2008b ) .",
    "the light curves of v1500 cyg are quite amazing ( fig .",

    "schmidt et al . also estimate that the orbital inclination angle is 50@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath38 70@xmath37 , and list values for the masses and radii of the two stellar components .",
    "we have used the most recent release of the wilson - divinney ( wilson & divinney 1971 ) code wd2010 to calculate model light curves using those parameters .",
    "in addition to our @xmath18 data , we include the @xmath40-band light curve of semeniuk et al .",
    "( 1995a ) in our modeling .",
    "for this modeling we have set the minima seen in the light curves to phase 0 ( corresponding to inferior conjunction of the secondary star ) , using just the photometric orbital period from semeniuk et al .",
    "( 1995a ) .",
    "we address phasing to both the true photometric and magnetic ephemerides , below . as shown in fig .",
    "5a , the model suggested by schmidt et al .",
    "( green line ) does not come close to reproducing the observed light curves .",
    "this is not wholly unexpected , as there is some evidence that the white dwarf primary in v1500 cyg is slowly cooling ( somers & naylor 1999 ) .",
    "thus , we explored models with cooler white dwarfs , and a wider range of inclinations .",
    "the best fitting models , holding the secondary star temperature to 3,000 k , corresponds to an orbital inclination of 30@xmath37 , and a white dwarf with a temperature of 58,500 k ( red curve in fig .",

    "since there are no reports for an eclipse of the primary by the secondary star in v1500 cyg , this can not be the explanation for the sharp minima we see here .",
    "it is also quite obvious that the light curves are not the perfect sinusoids that are predicted by the light curve modeling . starting near phase 0.7 , and lasting until phase 0.9",

    "it is interesting to plot the location of the times of the magnetic phase zero .",
    "the timing of this event is indicated by the dashed lines in fig . 5b . just before the calculated time of magnetic phase zero ,",
    "there is a decline / dip seen in all three near - ir light curves . given the failure of the light curve models to explain the morphology of these light curves , and the presence of a dip near magnetic phase zero , suggests that this feature is tied to the visibility of the magnetic accretion regions .",
    "if we assume that the two accreting magnetic poles are separated by exactly 180@xmath37 in longitude , there should be a second self - eclipse one half phase later ( @xmath41 = 0.5 ) than that which occurs at magnetic phase 0 .",
    "we indicate the location of this time in fig .",
    "5b with a dotted vertical line",
    ". there appears to be a small discontinuity in the light curves at the time of this event .",
    "thus , it appears that some of the near - ir luminosity is driven by cyclotron emission from the magnetic accretion regions .",
    "it is impossible to fully quantify this emission , but if we return to the original schmidt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) irradiated secondary star model , and simply normalize its light curve to pass through the data at magnetic phase 0 , while attempting to match the light curve minima , we can make an estimate .",
    "when this is done , we find that during the time when the circularly polarized light curve ( see schmidt et al .",
    "1991 ) is dominated by negatively polarized flux , we see a strong excess in all three bandpasses .",
    "this excess disappears at @xmath41 = 0 .",
    "the @xmath19- and @xmath20-band light curves show a small excess above the model light curve during the maxima of the positively circularized flux , but there is no such excess in the @xmath21-band during this time .",
    "given this scenario , the cyclotron emission supplies about 30% of the near - ir luminosity of the system at the time of the maximum in the negative circularly polarized flux .",
    "schmidt et al . ( 1995 ) note that , besides the circular polarization , there is little evidence in the optical for significant , modulated emission from the magnetic accretion regions . while these two results seem contradictory , it appears to be a rather common property of normal polars : both st lmi ( cropper 1987 ) and am her ( michalsky et al . 1977 )",

    "the @xmath21-band light curve of v1974 cyg is reminiscent of that for v1500 cyg , and both the @xmath19- and @xmath20-band light curves show what appears to be a minimum near the same time as that seen in the @xmath21-band .",
    "this same level of variability is also present in the @xmath0 w1 light curve .",
    "it is also important to note that collazzi et al .",

    "gk per is the only other cne that is known to show dwarf nova outbursts ( c.f .",
    "bianchini et al .",

    "there is a pointed ( 2.6 ksec ) @xmath46 observation for qv vul ( obtained in 1995 , eight years after outburst ) that shows a very weak source ( s / n @xmath38 3 ) at the correct position .",
    "the combination of large amplitude variations and x - ray emission are suggestive of a magnetic cv .",
    "higher quality data , with better temporal coverage are needed .",

    "there is a @xmath46 pointed observation for cp lac that shows a very weak source , 0.0032 counts sec@xmath6 , at the correct position for this old nova .",
    "no such detection exists for v per .",
    "while there have been numerous claims for old novae having magnetic white dwarfs , the majority of these usually suggest that the system is an ip .",
    "the two best cases for polars remain v1500 cyg and v2214 oph .",
    "our phase - resolved spectroscopy did not show any evidence for discrete cyclotron features from v1500 cyg .",
    "examination of the @xmath18 light curves , however , indicate the presence of excess , phase - dependent emission that contributes up to 30% of the broadband flux when the circular polarization is at its maximum .",
    "the @xmath18 light curves of v1974 cyg strongly resemble those of v1500 cyg .",
    "this nova erupted more recently ( 1992 ) , and is the most recent of the cne for which we obtained light curves .",
    "thus , irradiation by a hot white dwarf is certainly a viable interpretation of those data .",
    "that both v1500 cyg and v1974 cyg have remained much more luminous after their outbursts than seen prior to their eruptions , strengthens the case for v1974 cyg harboring a highly magnetic white dwarf .",
    "two other objects in our sample , v446 her and qv vul , had light curves that showed large amplitude variations that are similar to the light curves of polars , though v446 her shows dwarf novae outbursts which rules out such a classification . both of these objects do appear to be x - ray sources , and thus new x - ray observations of all these cne would be useful to explore whether they harbor magnetic white dwarfs .      to examine whether the current infrared colors of v1500 cyg are unusual , allowing us a quicker way to identify similar systems amongst old cne , we extracted the @xmath18 photometry of cne in the 2mass catalog . with these data in hand , we can examine the de - reddened colors of old cne .",
    "we present an infrared color - color plot in fig .",
    "the mean de - reddened colors of old cne are @xmath61(@xmath19  @xmath16  @xmath20)@xmath65@xmath62 = 0.22 @xmath34 0.18 and @xmath61(@xmath20  @xmath16  @xmath21)@xmath65@xmath62 = 0.07 @xmath34 0.10 ( note : all recent novae and rne have been excluded from this calculation , as have objects with s / n @xmath64 3 in their photometry , along with gk per and rr tel , two objects that have ir colors dominated by their secondary stars ) . in fig .",
    "14 we also plot the position of v1500 cyg at maximum and minimum light ( as stars ) .",
    "v1500 cyg is redder at minimum than maximum , but these colors are not especially unusual when compared to those of other old cne . without the light curves , there would be nothing to indicate that v1500 cyg had unusual photometric properties .    with a mean infrared color relation defined for old novae , we can attempt to use it to estimate the visual extinction for cne that lack such estimates , as well as compare how well this technique reproduces published values of a@xmath23 for these objects .",
    "these estimates are the ( first ) italicized values in the final column of table 3 .",
    "szkody ( 1994 ) obtained optical and ir photometry for a large sample of old novae , and defined the mean de - reddened colors of novae in both ( @xmath66 @xmath16 @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath40 @xmath16 @xmath19 ) . using @xmath40-band photometry of the cne ( from szkody 1994 , or duerbeck & seitter 1987 ) , and the 2mass @xmath19-band photometry , we have estimated extinctions using the relation @xmath61(@xmath40",
    "@xmath16  @xmath19)@xmath65@xmath62 = 0.27 ( szkody 1994 ) , where possible .",
    "if there is a second italicized value in the final column of table 3 , it results from this estimation technique .",
    "it is always dangerous to assume a global correlation for a diverse group of objects , and thus it is worthwhile to qualitatively assess the reddenings derived from the near - ir photometry .",
    "the orbital periods of the objects in this table range from 48 hr for gk per down to 1.5 hr for cp pup ( though see diaz & steiner 1991 , who suggest cp pup is an ip , and that this is the white dwarf spin period ) . thus , to fill their roche lobes and transfer matter to their white dwarf primaries , the secondary stars in these systems must range in size from subgiants , down to m dwarfs . as shown in infrared spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , harrison et al .",
    "2004 ) , most cvs with p@xmath28 @xmath10 3 hr show absorption line features attributable to their secondary stars . for shorter period systems ( p@xmath28 @xmath64 2 hr )",
    ", the secondary stars are much more difficult to detect ( e.g. , hamilton et al .",
    "thus , assuming that hot sources completely dominate the @xmath18 colors of old cne should be assumed with caution for longer period cne .",
    "a cursory inspection of the estimated extinction values presented in table 3 , however , shows that assuming mean , quiescent infrared colors for old cne is a useful technique for estimating extinction values . for objects with high quality photometry ,",
    "the estimated extinction values are quite similar to the previous published values , especially if several values were averaged to produce the a@xmath23 measurement . in general , all disk - dominated cvs are blue , with their spectra being dominated by emission from the white dwarf and accretion disk hotspot . in the near - ir , we observe these sources on the rayleigh - jeans tail of those blackbodies . and",
    "thus , if there is no significant contamination from the secondary star , such a technique is fairly robust .",
    "it is important to note that a great variety of techniques were used to derive the `` known '' extinction values and these themselves are prone to significant uncertainties ( c.f . , lance et al .",
    "1988 for a discussion of the reddening estimates for v1500 cyg ) , or were derived assuming some sort of photometric relationship not unlike that used here ( e.g. , weight et al . 1994 , miroshnichenko 1988 ) .",
    "the main weaknesses of this technique are twofold : 1 ) infrared colors are not very sensitive to low values of extinction , and 2 ) the secondary star could contaminate the quiescent colors of longer period cne .",
    "examples of the first weakness are demonstrated by the estimated a@xmath23 values for rr pic , v533 her , and hr del , objects with well - determined , but low values of extinction .",
    "if there are near - ir excesses for these three objects , they are lost in the noise of the relationship .",
    "in contrast , two objects that appear to have values of their estimated extinctions that are too large when compared to the previously published values , qz aur ( p@xmath28 = 8.6 hr ) and bt mon ( p@xmath28 = 8.0 hr ) , are longer period cne binaries that been shown to have secondary stars which are detectable in visual data ( campbell & shafter 1995 , smith et al .",
    "clearly , the secondary stars in these two systems must contaminate the @xmath18 photometry at a level sufficient to produce the unrealistically large values of their estimated extinctions .",
    "alternatively , excessively large values of the estimated reddening for some cne might indicate cases of source confusion , especially if the previously published extinction value was determined near outburst .      as shown above , we have extracted light curve data from the @xmath0 `` all sky single exposure table '' to compare to our @xmath18 light curves for a couple of sources .",
    "given the value of such data for easily detecting the presence of strong , low - harmonic cyclotron emission ( see harrison et al .",
    "2013b ) , we decided to extract @xmath0 photometry for all of the cne with 2mass detections .",
    "those data are listed in table 4 . from that photometry",

    "we have plotted the locus of main sequence star colors in green .",
    "a large group of old cne appear to have colors consistent with main sequence stars .",
    "while it is possible that this might be due to these objects having returned to a deep quiescence , having their ir colors dominated by their donor stars , it is probably just as likely that a number of these detections are the result of source confusion .",
    "the bright , isolated cne ( e.g. , dq her , v603 aql , hr del ) have very blue ( w1 @xmath16 w2 ) colors , suggesting that candidates with ( w1 @xmath16 w2 ) @xmath67 0.0 are true cne remnants .",

    "2005 , and references therein ) and v445 pup ( lynch et al . 2001 ) produced significant dust shells that can explain the observed seds with their strong w3 and w4-band excesses .",
    "it is interesting , however , that v2467 cyg , v1494 aql , and v1974 cyg did not appear to produce dust shells ( see helton et al .",

    "both data sets can be fitted with blackbodies having temperatures t@xmath71 @xmath12 125 k. perhaps like the dust - free cne observed by @xmath24 , it is line emission that is producing the mid - ir excess in hr del .",
    "such a scenario remains viable as , according to friedjung et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the ultraviolet luminosity of hr del has changed little over the last thirty years .",
    "they suggest that continued thermonuclear burning is the best explanation for this prolonged period of activity",
    ". it would be useful to get spectra to ascertain the nature of the mid - ir excess of hr del .",
    "harrison & gehrz ( 1988 , 1991 , 1992 , 1994 ) published a series of papers on @xmath26 observations of cne and concluded that the detection rate was of order 40% away from the galactic center .",
    "in the intervening decades , the @xmath26 `` 1d '' scan co - addition software scanpi used in those surveys has been markedly improved .",
    "input of the list of objects listed in table 3 into scanpi , and using the selection criteria of harrison & gehrz ( 1988 ) , results in nine detections in the 12 and/or 25 @xmath1 m bandpasses ( excluding gq mus and v341 nor which were in outburst during the @xmath26 mission ) . of these",
    ", only the 25 @xmath1 m detection of hr del is consistent with the detection of the cne remnant .",
    "the other eight detections were all the result of source confusion due to a nearby object that is identifiable in the @xmath0 images .",
    "thus , of the approximately 160 cne surveyed with @xmath26 , only hr del and dq her ( see harrison et al .",
    "2013a ) are confirmed as detections of the quiescent novae .",
    "old cne are _ not _ luminous mid / far - infrared sources .",
    "we have obtained phase resolved near - infrared photometry and spectroscopy of v1500 cyg to search for cyclotron emission in this object to confirm that it is a highly magnetic polar .",
    "while evidence for significant cyclotron emission exists , it is impossible to make secure estimates of its contribution to the overall flux as it depends on the model used for the underlying binary .",
    "what is needed is a fuller set of phase - resolved @xmath18 spectra to separate - out the flux of the component that is modulated at the spin period of the white dwarf .",
    "the data sets for several of the other cne are intriguing , and suggest that follow - up x - ray observations might be useful in confirming whether additional magnetic systems exist among old cne . that both v1500 cyg and v1974 cyg remain much more luminous now compared to their pre - outburst levels , and that they have similar light curves ,",
    "suggests that v1974 cyg might also harbor a highly magnetic white dwarf .",
    "if this can be proven , perhaps one way to identify magnetic systems is specifically targeting those cne that show a large difference between their pre- , and post - outburst luminosities .",
    "the @xmath0 w4 band data for several systems indicates that strong mid - ir line emission continues to be emitted by some cne decades after their outbursts .",
    "such emission requires a luminous , ionizing source , and suggests that some cne may continue to have stable nuclear burning occurring on the surfaces of their white dwarf primaries .",
    "the majority of quiescent old cne do not have significant mid / far - infrared emission .",
