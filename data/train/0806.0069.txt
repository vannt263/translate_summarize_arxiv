    "protons with an energy up to 920 gev were brought into collision with electrons or positrons of energy 27.6 gev at two experiments , h1 and zeus , each of which collected about 0.5  fb@xmath1 of data .",
    "together with measuring the structure of the proton , the deep inelastic collisions ( dis ) produced at hera , at a centre of mass energy up to 318  gev , provided an ideal environment to study rare processes , set constraints on the standard model ( sm ) and search for new particles and physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "events containing a high transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) isolated electron or muon and missing @xmath6 have been observed at hera  @xcite .",
    "an excess of hera  i data events ( 19942000 which is mostly in @xmath4 collisions ) compared to the sm prediction at large hadronic transverse momentum @xmath12 was reported by the h1 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this was not confirmed by the zeus collaboration , although the analysis was performed in a more restricted phase space  @xcite .",
    "the main sm contribution to the signal topology is the production of real @xmath5 bosons via photoproduction with subsequent leptonic decay @xmath13(@xmath14)@xmath15 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : feyn ] , where the hadronic system @xmath15 has typically low @xmath6 .",
    "the equivalent charged current ( cc ) process , @xmath16@xmath17(@xmath14)@xmath15 , also contributes to the total signal rate , although only at a level of about 7% .",
    "the production of @xmath18 bosons with subsequent decay to neutrinos @xmath19(@xmath20)@xmath15 results in a further minor contribution to the total signal rate in the electron channel at a level of 3% .",
    "sm signal processes are modelled using the event generator epvec  @xcite .",
    "the main @xmath5 production via photoproduction component is reweighted to a nlo calculation  @xcite , which has a theoretical uncertainty of 15% .",
    "sm background enters the electron channel due to mismeasured neutral current ( nc ) events and the muon channel due to lepton pair ( lp ) events in which one muon escapes detection , both cases resulting in apparent ( fake ) missing transverse momentum .",
    "cc background , which contains intrinsic missing transverse momentum , enters the final sample in both lepton channels , where a final state particle is interpreted as the isolated electron or muon .",
    "( @xmath14)@xmath15 , which is the main sm signal contribution to the search for events with isolated leptons and missing transverse momentum . ]",
    "the event selection employed by the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite analyses is very similar and may be summarised as follows : the identified lepton should have high transverse momentum @xmath21  10  gev , be observed in the central region of the detector and be isolated with respect to jets and other good quality tracks in the event .",
    "the event should also contain a large transverse momentum imbalance , @xmath22  12  gev .",
    "further cuts are then applied , which are designed to reduce sm background , whilst preserving a high level of signal purity .",
    "event quantities which are sensitive to the presence of undetected energetic particles in the event are employed such as the azimuthal balance of the event , the difference in azimuthal angle between the lepton and the hadronic system and the longitudinal momentum imbalance . to ensure that the two lepton channels are exclusive , and",
    "may therefore be combined , electron events must contain no isolated muons .",
    "both h1 and zeus have recently performed the analysis of the electron and muon channels on their respective complete hera i+ii @xmath10 data sets , which correspond to approximately 0.5  fb@xmath1 per experiment  @xcite .",
    "a total of 59 events are observed in the h1 data , compared to a sm prediction of 58.9  @xmath2  8.2 . for @xmath3 25",
    "gev , a total of 24 events are observed compared to a sm prediction of 15.8  @xmath2  2.5 , where 21 events are observed in the @xmath4 data compared to a sm prediction of 8.9  @xmath2  1.5 .",
    "the observed data excess in the hera  i @xmath4 data  @xcite thus remains at the 3.0@xmath23 level for the complete h1 @xmath4 data  @xcite .    in the zeus analysis of the complete hera  i+ii data ,",
    "41 data events are observed in agreement with the sm prediction of 48.3  @xmath2  6.8  @xcite . unlike in the h1 analysis , agreement between data and sm",
    "is also observed in the high @xmath12 region , where 11 events are seen in the @xmath10 data compared to a sm prediction of 13.1  @xmath2  1.8 .",
    "a study of the selection efficiency for signal processes found the h1 and zeus analyses to be compatible in the kinematic region where they are directly comparable  @xcite . the majority of the data events observed by h1 at @xmath3 25  gev are also found to be in the region of overlap of the two analyses . nevertheless , in order to coherently combine the results from the two experiments , a common phase space has been established .",
    "this common selection is based on the h1 event selection  @xcite , but covers a more restricted lepton polar angle range of 15@xmath24  120@xmath25 , as that employed in the zeus analysis  @xcite .",
    "the signal expectation rates of the h1 and zeus analyses using the common selection are found to be comparable , taking into account the respective luminosities of the data sets and the signal processes included .",

    "the production of single top quarks is kinematically possible in @xmath26 collisions at hera due to the large centre of mass energy of up to @xmath27  gev .",
    "the dominant sm process for single top production at hera is the charged current reaction @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , which has a negligible cross section of less than  1  fb .",
    "however , in several extensions of the sm the top quark is predicted to undergo flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions , which could lead to a sizeable anomalous single top production cross section at hera  @xcite .",
    "such events are of interest as the signature of the top decay to @xmath30 and @xmath5 with subsequent leptonic decay matches that of the isolated lepton events discussed in section [ sec : isointro ] . in particular , the hadronic final state from the fragmentation of the @xmath30 quark would exhibit high @xmath31 , and thus this process could provide an explanation of the data excess observed at high @xmath12 by the h1 experiment . and @xmath32 data .",
    "]    anomalous single top production is described by an effective lagrangian where the interaction of a top with @xmath33-type quarks via a photon is described by a magnetic coupling @xmath34 .",
    "the contribution from the charm quark is expected to be small at the large proton longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath35 needed to produce a top quark , and is therefore neglected ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the vector couplings to a @xmath37 boson @xmath38 are supressed at hera due to the large @xmath18 mass , and are also neglected in the present h1 analysis ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the h1 search for single top production is based on the full sample of events selected in the hera  i+ii data described in section [ sec : sep ] , so that the present analysis investigates the leptonic @xmath5 decay channels to electrons and muons .",
    "the first step in the analysis forms a _ top preselection _ of this event sample , by demanding good top quark reconstruction and lepton charge compatible with single top production  @xcite .",
    "three observables are investigated in this preselection , namely : the transverse momentum of the reconstructed @xmath30 quark candidate , the reconstructed top mass , and the @xmath5 decay angle  calculated as the angle between the lepton momentum in the @xmath5 rest frame and the @xmath5 direction in the top quark rest frame .",
    "the observed data distributions of these quantities agree well with the sm expectation within the uncertainties and no evidence for single top production is observed .",
    "the observables are then combined into a multi - variate discriminator , which is trained using a single top mc as the signal model and a @xmath5 boson mc as the background model .",
    "the resulting discriminator output for the electron and muon channels is found to provide good separation between @xmath5 and top mc events .",
    "limits on the signal cross section are extracted from the discriminator spectra using a maximum likelihood method  @xcite .",
    "likelihood functions are calculated for the electron and muon channel separately .",
    "an upper bound on the cross section of @xmath40  0.16  pb at 95% cl is found , which is translated into an upper bound on the coupling @xmath41  0.14 .",
