    "the discovery  @xcite of a new boson with a mass close to 125 gev has been well anticipated as the standard model higgs boson  @xcite and provided the first experimental evidence of the higgs mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is a great triumph , but not an end , of the giant campaign for higgs hunting in the development of particle physics .",
    "although the subsequent more precise measurements  @xcite at the lhc have shown the properties of the higgs boson are well consistent with the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) , the precision of the current experimental data still leave open the possibility of an extended higgs sector  @xcite . among many new physics scenarios beyond the sm , the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm )  @xcite are the simplest extensions of the sm .    in the 2hdms",
    ", an additional higgs doublet is introduced to the sm higgs sector , which could result in rich phenomena , in collider physics  @xcite , flavor physics  @xcite , neutrino physics  @xcite , dark matter  @xcite and cosmology  @xcite . however , unlike the sm , unwanted tree - level flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) interactions in the 2hdm are not forbidden by the glashow - illiopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism . besides some other solutions  @xcite , this issue is usually addressed by the natural flavor conservation ( nfc ) hypothesis through imposing a discrete @xmath1 symmetry  @xcite . according to different @xmath1 charge assignments",
    ", there are four types of the nfc 2hdm , referred to as the type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y 2hdm , respectively .",
    "of course , there are new parameters in the 2hdms to be determined or excluded by the measurements of electro - weak processes . to this end , b - meson decays are usually employed to constrain their parameter spaces .    among the rare b - meson decays , the leptonic processes @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , or @xmath13 ) are of special interest  @xcite .",
    "they suffer from very few hadronic uncertainties and are induced by fcnc transitions , which make them sensitive probes to the effects of physics beyond the sm , especially models with a non - standard higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "recently , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) electroweak corrections and the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd corrections  @xcite in the sm have been calculated . on the bsm side ,",

    "@xcite .    motivated by this progress ,",
    "in this paper we perform a detailed study of the @xmath0 decay within the 2hdms with @xmath1 symmetry . at present , this process is calculated in the type - ii 2hdm in large @xmath2 limit only  @xcite . using the higgs base correspondence between the a2hdm and the 2hdms , we will derive the relevant full one - loop wilson coefficients of the four variant 2hdms contributing to the @xmath0 decay from the recent a2hdm results  @xcite without the large @xmath2 approximation .",
    "we also investigate the possibility to discriminate the four different types of 2hdm in the light of the recent collider and flavor physics data , as an update of our previous work  @xcite .",
    "we combine the constraints from @xmath14 , @xmath15 mixing , @xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite , with the experimental data from the direct search for higgs bosons at lep  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite and lhc  @xcite , and the constraints from perturbativity , tree - level vacuum stability and perturbative unitary . for the @xmath0 decay ,",
    "the correlations between its branching ratio and the mass - eigenstate rate asymmetry @xmath6 are also reevaluated with the constrained parameter space of the 2hdms obtained in this paper .",
    "we have found that @xmath6 can slightly deviate from the sm prediction in the type - ii 2hdm only , and that the ratio of time - integrated @xmath5 gets similar contributions from the four 2hdms ; this makes it very hard to discriminate the four types of 2hdms with the correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath5 as suggested in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : bs_lm_lm ] , we give a brief overview of the @xmath0 decay . in section  [ sec : wc ] , full one - loop contributions from the 2hdms with @xmath1 symmetry are derived explicitly . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we give our detailed numerical results and discussions .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the relevant theoretical formulas are recapitulated in the appendix .",
    "in the sm , the leptonic decays @xmath11 ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) arise from the @xmath18 box and @xmath19 penguin diagrams .",

    "we have derived the full one - loop wilson coefficients @xmath26 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 from the recent a2hdm results  @xcite , which can be applied to the contributions of all the four types of 2hdms for both large and small @xmath2 value .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized as follows :    * compared to @xmath26 , the wilson coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are negligible in the entire 2hdm parameter space , except for large @xmath2 in the type - ii 2hdm or small cp - odd higgs mass @xmath75 in the four models .",
    "in addition , only the wilson coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the type - ii 2hdm can be enhanced by large @xmath2 . *",
    "the soft @xmath1 symmetry breaking parameter @xmath3 enters into the higgs penguin diagrams and affects the wilson coefficient @xmath42 .",
    "the dominant contributions are proportional to @xmath131 and enhanced by @xmath4 in the type - ii 2hdm , which have not been considered in the literature  @xcite . however , after combing the theoretical constraints from perturbativity , vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity , we have found that the parameter @xmath3 can not make more significant contributions than other terms in the wilson coefficients . * after imposing the experimental constraints , regions with small @xmath2 are excluded for all the four types of 2hdm , which are quite different from our previous results  @xcite .",
    "as expected , large @xmath2 region is only excluded in the type - ii 2hdm .    as an update of our previous analysis  @xcite",
    ", we have also investigated the possibility to distinguish the four types of 2hdm in light of the recent updated flavor physics data , the collider data from the direct searches for higgs bosons and the theoretical progresses .",
    "the combined bounds on the 2hdm parameters have been derived for the four models . in the survived parameter regions , the correlations between @xmath6 and @xmath168 in all the four of the 2hdms are almost indistinguishable from each other . in the 2hdms with @xmath1 symmetry , @xmath6 can only have a very tiny deviation from the sm prediction , while @xmath168 could deviate from the sm one sizably .",
