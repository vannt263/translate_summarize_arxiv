    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are excellent laboratories of stellar evolution and host abundant representatives of some of the more exotic stellar evolutionary phases .",
    "one such , still relatively unexplored phase is known by the name of its representatives , namely blue straggler stars ( bsss ) .",
    "bsss are characterized by their effective temperatures and luminosities as members of the main - sequence stellar population .  however , given the ages of their host gcs they are expected to have evolved off the main - sequence to become red giant stars long time ago as their hertzsprung - russell diagram parameters place them at higher temperatures and luminosities , thus higher stellar masses , with respect to the main - sequence turn - off point @xcite .",
    "the existence of bsss implies that they must form in more recent events , after the majority of the constituent gc stellar population was formed .      in the recent literature ,",
    "two formation mechanisms have gained most acceptance and are currently lively debated : @xmath15 bsss form in stellar mergers induced by stellar collisions or binary interaction @xcite , or @xmath16 bsss are rejuvenated stars forming by mass transfer in a binary system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed review ) .",
    "both of these scenarios are believed to be actively at work and their predominance being a function of the local environment .",
    "it was first suggested that collision - induced bsss are expected to form in the high density parts of gcs while mass - transfer bsss are thought to form in the loose outskirts of gcs @xcite .  although first efforts aimed at measuring which of the two mechanisms dominated @xcite , there is recent evidence that both mechanisms are simultaneously at work in gcs @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed the presence of two distinct bss sequences in m30 in a deep color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) study , which the authors believe is suggestive of different formation histories / mechanisms for each bss sequence .",
    "m30 is thought to have undergone core - collapse which could be responsible for the observed two bss sequences in the cmd . in this respect , being able to distinguish between different bss formation processes could become a powerful tool to constrain the gc dynamical evolution history ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "previous attempts at detecting a certain bss formation mechanism is the c - o depletion measured in six 47tuc bsss @xcite .",
    "such c - o depleted bsss are expected if during their formation they accreted cno - processed material from their binary companions .",
    "therefore , such chemical anomalies may directly point to a mass - transfer mechanism .",
    "however , most of the bsss in the sample were located in the outer regions of 47tuc , where mass - transfer induced bss formation is expected to be the dominant mechanism , and still only 14% of the studied bsss were found having this c - o depletion ( i.e.  mass - transfer ) signature .",
    "it is clear that the problem of bss formation is far from being fully understood , and it is therefore fundamental to perform similar chemical analyses , including other elements , of bsss in larger samples of gcs , significantly increasing the sample statistics .",
    "+ another potential indicator of the bss formation mechanism may be their rotational velocity distribution function .",
    "in the mass - transfer scenario , the resulting bss is believed to conserve most of the angular momentum from the binary system @xcite , therefore becoming a fast rotator ( @xmath17 km s@xmath7 ) , as well as in the collision - induced formation scenario , in which it is also claimed that bsss are formed having high rotational velocities @xcite .",
    "however , models show that in both cases bsss could lose most of their initial angular momentum through mechanisms such as accretion disk braking / locking @xcite .",
    "this means that being able to link certain rotational velocity distributions to a certain formation mechanism is rather still complex .",
    "previous surveys of rotational velocities of bsss include @xcite who found that 40% of the measured bsss in m4 are fast rotators , which is the largest frequency of rapidly rotating bsss ever detected in a gc , although no c - o depletion was found in any of these bsss .",
    "another study @xcite shows a flat radial distribution for the bsss in ngc5139 ( @xmath0cen ) , suggesting that this cluster is not completely relaxed yet , and therefore its bss population would have been mainly formed in a mass - transfer scenario in binaries .",
    "the same group has completed a spectroscopic survey of 78 bsss in @xmath0cen and found that the majority of them have rotational velocities",
    "@xmath18 km s@xmath7 , but still a considerable fraction ( 30% ) are fast rotators of which some rotate even faster than 100 km s@xmath7 @xcite . following the intriguing bss double - sequence in m30 mentioned earlier , 12 bsss were also observed in this cluster and most of them were found to rotate slowly @xcite .",
    "yet another example is the rotational velocity distribution measured for ngc6397 @xcite which shows most bsss to rotate very slowly , and only one of them being a fast rotator .",
    "the apparent tendency is therefore a similar bss rotational velocity distribution function for many gcs , usually peaked around 10 km s@xmath7 , and a low fraction of fast rotators , except for the cases of m4 and @xmath0cen . the clear link between these observations and a definitive formation mechanism is still very unclear , since neither chemical analysis nor models have been able to successfully interpret these results .",
    "this rather complex scenario calls for larger surveys simultaneously sampling dynamical and chemical properties of bsss with a homogeneous dataset in order to get a wider picture of the bss formation processes and to improve on the statistical significance of previous results .  in that context , we carry out this study which presents the first results of a pilot program intended to set constraints on the formation mechanisms of bsss in gcs based on their spectral characteristics .",
    "we select three gcs :   ( @xmath19h17m36.82s , @xmath20d2444.9 ) , ( @xmath2116h47m14.18s , @xmath22d5654.7 ) ,  and   ( @xmath0cen ; @xmath23=13h26m47.24s , @xmath24d2846.5 ) .",
    "their bss populations have not been previously characterized spectroscopically , except for the case of @xmath0cen as described above .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations and data reduction process .",
    "section 3 analyzes the radial and rotational velocities of bsss . in section 4",
    "we discuss the properties of bsss in the context of our results , and summarize the main result and conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the data used in this work were obtained as part of the observing program cntac2012a-101 using the multi - slit mode of the imacs f/4 spectrograph mounted on the 6.5-meter baade telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the observations were performed on the night of march 21st , 2012 , with overall good sky conditions and an average seeing of 0.6 .",
    "multi - slit masks were cut to obtain spectra of 42 , 61 and 34 bss candidates in ngc3201 , @xmath0cen and ngc6218 , respectively .",
    "the slit mask configurations were designed such that the center of each gc was placed near the slit - mask center in order to homogeneously obtain spectra of bss candidates located at as much as @xmath25 of radial cluster - centric distance .  in this manner we radially sampled the targets up to approximately 8.5 , 4.6 , and 6.8@xmath26 in ngc3201 , @xmath0cen , and ngc6218 , respectively .",
    "the science observations consisted of 20-minute sub - exposures , from which we obtained total exposure times of 1h:40 m for ngc3201 and ngc6218 , and 1h:20 m for @xmath0cen , providing a mean signal - to - noise ratio of s / n  @xmath27 .  interspersed between the science target observations",
    ", we also obtained spectra for two photometric standards , five rotational velocity standards and arc calibration frames .",
    "standard bias and flat - field frames were obtained at the beginning and at the end of the night .",
    "the instrumental spectrograph configuration for all multi - object science exposures consisted of 4  long and 0.7  wide slits and the 1200 l / mm grism blazed at 17.45@xmath28 , which yields a wavelength coverage of @xmath293600 - 5200  with a spectral resolution of @xmath1 and a resulting velocity resolution of @xmath30 km / s .",
    "the corresponding instrumental dispersion relation is @xmath31  / pix .",
    "+ the spectroscopic bss target selection was performed on f606w ( @xmath29@xmath32 ) and f814w ( @xmath29@xmath33 ) band photometric catalogs from the _ hst / acs galactic gc survey _ @xcite combined with catalogs generated using wide - field imager ( wfi ) data obtained from the eso science archive plus a large wfi photometric catalog of @xmath0cen available online @xcite .",
    "the reason for combining hst and wfi catalogs is that the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the acs camera samples only the inner @xmath34 of the target gcs while the wfi data extends well outside the @xmath35 field of view of the imacs f/4 camera .  by combining these two datasets",
    "we guarantee homogeneous sampling of the dense core regions and the outskirts of each gc .",
    "the bss candidates were selected from making color and magnitude cuts in the cmds of each gc .",
    "the selection criteria is the one from @xcite which uses the @xmath32 and @xmath33 filter magnitudes to determine regions in the cmd that are exclusive to specific stellar evolutionary phases .",
    "these selection criteria and the physical limits of the mask design , set by the slit length and width , resulted in a final selection of 137 bss candidates .",
    "figure  [ cmd1 ] shows the cmds of all three gcs and the spatial distribution of all photometrically selected bss candidates using hst / acs and eso / wfi data .     and",
    "20% of them have s / n  @xmath36.,width=336 ]      the reduction of the data was performed in different levels in order to obtain 1-dimensional spectra for each individual bss candidate from the original frames that contain the multi - slit exposures .",
    "the major part of this work was performed using the cosmos reduction software ( v2.18 ) , which is a suite of programs dedicated for the reduction of multi - slit spectroscopy data obtained with the imacs instrument on the baade magellan telescope .",
    "standard bias and flat - field calibration is performed with cosmos sub - routines .",
    "this package allows for an accurate prediction of the location of spectral features of individual slits thanks to a series of alignment and calibration procedures based on raytracing models of the instrument .",
    "these models provide a map that is accurate down to @xmath37 pixels .",
    "the program then uses the arc frames to correct these predictions to an accuracy of a fraction of a pixel , constructing the final field distortion map that is then used for the science data wavelength calibration .",
    "the final wavelength solution we obtain is accurate to about @xmath38 pixels for all targets .",
    "we then apply the corresponding calibrations and subtract the sky through different tasks in cosmos and get the individual 2-dimensional spectra for each target .",
    "these spectra are then resampled to a linear wavelength scale with a dispersion of 0.1  / pix .",
    "the final 1-dimensional extraction is then performed using iraf task apall .",
    "we show in figure  [ example_spectra ] the h@xmath39 and mg@xmath40 triplet spectral regions for different bsss spanning the representatives values of s / n , as obtained from its distribution shown in figure  [ snr_dist ] .",
    "we discard spectra with s / n@xmath4120 and others affected by contamination , resulting in sample sizes of 41 , 49 and 32 bss candidates in ngc 3201 , @xmath0cen and ngc 6218 , respectively .",
    "we perform radial velocity measurements for all our spectra in order to study the membership likelihood and to compare our measurements with the gc radial velocity values found in the literature .",
    "we use the iraf task fxcor @xcite to compute radial velocities via fourier cross correlation between the science data and a set of template spectra .  as templates",
    "we use the high - resolution ( @xmath42 ) spectra from the elodie library @xcite .  in most cases ,",
    "strong absorption regions like the balmer lines and the mg@xmath40 triplet region were used in the cross correlation and for all our targets we avoided spectral regions affected by cosmic - ray hits and the ccd inter - chip gaps .",
    "the radial velocities obtained are however relative to the frame of reference of the template spectra used in the task fxcor , therefore we repeat the process with our observed standards stars and compare the radial velocities obtained against those in the literature .  this way we can calculate the radial shifts of the templates themselves and use this to calibrate the values obtained for each bss .",
    "the final laboratory restframe radial velocity was calculated by taking the error - weighed mean of five measurements from different templates .",
    "we used the iraf task rvcorrect to obtain the final heliocentric radial velocities by using the date , location , and sky coordinates of the observations to correct for the earth s relative velocity against the sun .",
    "the final heliocentric radial - velocity distributions of our sample bss candidates are shown in figure  [ rad_vel_3 ] for each gc .",
    "the corresponding heliocentric radial velocities of ngc3201 , @xmath0cen , and ngc6218 from @xcite are shown as long - dashed lines while the mean values of our measurements are shown as short - dashed vertical lines .",
    "for all gcs , we find mean radial velocity values that are not more than @xmath294 - 8 km s@xmath7 different from the literature values .",
    "we use our mean radial velocities to study the cluster membership of each bss candidate .",
    "these values are @xmath43 , and @xmath44 km s@xmath7 for ngc3201 , ngc5139 , and ngc6218 , respectively , respectively .",
    "] , where the errors correspond to 1@xmath45 .  we adopt a 3-@xmath45 cut and label outliers rather than eliminating them from the sample , in order to individually check their membership likelihood .  in figure  [ rad_vel_3 ] ,",
    "all outliers are labeled and the non - filled bins show stars with radial velocities off the limits of the figure . after this cut , we are left with 36 , 47 and 31 bsss in ngc 3201 , @xmath0cen and ngc 6218 respectively .",
    "overall we find that @xmath46 of our bss candidates show radial velocities consistent with the system velocity of their parent gc .",
    "this suggests that the field star contamination is low ( few % ) , indicating that bsss are majorly exclusive elements of dense stellar environments as found in gcs .",
    "the outliers found in each sample can be divided arbitrarily into two groups : the ones with radial velocity differences larger than 100 km s@xmath7 with respect to the mean value , and the ones in which the difference is less than that .",
    "we choose to further include outlier stars from the second group under the criteria that these could be bsss that formed in strong dynamical events which then transferred large amounts of momentum into kinetic energy .",
    "these are star a5 and c1 from ngc 3201 and ngc 6218 , respectively , which will be also studied in order to check their role in the final dynamical distribution functions for each gc .",
    "the bulk of the distributions in figure  [ rad_vel_3 ] is , in all cases , fairly symmetrically distributed around the mean value , with very few outliers .",
    "the width of the distributions is similar for ngc3201 ( @xmath47 kms@xmath7 ) and ngc6218 ( @xmath48 kms@xmath7 ) , while @xmath0cen shows about a factor of 2 larger value , i.e.  @xmath49 kms@xmath7 .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the central velocity dispersions reported in @xcite , i.e.  @xmath50 ( ngc3201 ) , @xmath51 ( ngc5139 ) , and @xmath52 km s@xmath7 ( ngc6218 ) .",
    "however , the radial velocity dispersions are systematically larger than the central parts of the constituent stellar populations in each gc , which interestingly could be explained by dynamical interactions such as those that might form a bss , or by the fact that bsss are likely to be part of binary systems , and therefore their radial velocities could be enhanced by orbital motion .",
    "this intriguing result requires confirmation with larger bss samples testing whether bsss have different radial velocity dispersion profiles than the rest of the gc stellar population .",
    "the fact that we are including stars such as a5 and c1 into our bss sample calls for a better understanding of how susceptible our sample is to field stars contamination . in order to get an approximate idea",
    "we have checked the radial velocity distributions of field stars using the galactic model of @xcite and found that the field stars in the line of sight of ngc3201 and ngc5139 have radial velocity values ranging @xmath53 km s@xmath7 and @xmath54 km s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "these velocities are clearly distinct from the systemic velocities found for these two globular clusters , and , therefore , the probability of our bsss being false positives is very low .",
    "this is also the case for outliers such as star a5 which is also highly inconsistent with the radial velocity distribution of field stars along that line of sight . for field stars along the ngc6218 line of sight we find model predicted radial velocities in the range @xmath55 km s@xmath7 ( which includes the radial velocity found for star c1 ) , even with a peak in their distribution function around @xmath56 km s@xmath7 , which is very similar to what is found for the mean radial velocity of bsss in ngc6218 .",
    "hence , the bss radial velocity distribution in this globular cluster requires particular attention .  for this",
    "we have searched the proper motion data catalog of @xcite and found measurements for 16 out of our 32 bsss studied in ngc6218 .",
    "all of them show proper motions consistent with being cluster members .",
    "we then check the radial velocity distribution of these 16 bsss and find that they populate the entire radial velocity distribution found for the entire sample of 32 bsss .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the sample of proper - motion confirmed bsss and the entire sample are likely to have identical radial velocity distributions with a p - value @xmath57 .",
    "this , of course , does not completely rule out the possibility of including field stars in our sample , yet if there happened to be such contaminants , these results suggest that they would consist of a minor fraction .",
    "we do not have proper motion information for star c1 and so a final conclusion can not be drawn concerning its membership probability .",
    "we note that this is the innermost star in the sample , which alone favours the cluster membership option .",
    "the inclusion of a5 and c1 in the confirmed bss sample must , therefore , be handled with care .    .",
    "b1 and b2 have velocities of 15.6 and 360.6 km s@xmath7 respectively.,width=336 ]        rotational velocities are obtained for all our sample star spectra by using the penalized pixel fitting algorithm called ppxf , which is an idl program to extract the kinematics of stellar populations from integrated - light absorption - line spectra of galaxies . this software implements the penalized pixel - fitting method developed by @xcite as a way to recover the central velocity , @xmath58 , and the standard deviation , @xmath45 , as well as high - order moments such as skewness and kurtosis from the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) through a gauss - hermite expansion of the absorption - line profile of the following form : @xmath59\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the frequency , @xmath61 , @xmath62 are hermite polynomials and @xmath63 is the losvd .",
    "the program uses `` initial guess '' input values of @xmath58 and @xmath45 to convolve template spectra in order to fit the object spectra .",
    "the fitting consists of a nonlinear least - squares optimization of the parameters @xmath64 .",
    "the code then uses a penalty function , derived from the deviation of the object line profile from a gaussian , which is added to the @xmath65 of the fit .",
    "therefore , a penalized @xmath65 is calculated as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the penalty function , that according to the authors can be approximated by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which is a _ bias _ parameter chosen by the user .",
    "the fitting is iterated until the variance is minimized and the fit converges .",
    "this ppxf procedure predisposes the solution with a single gaussian when the s / n is low , while it is able to recover the higher - order moments of the absorption line spectrum when the s / n is high . for more details on the algorithm the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .       and @xmath70 as a function of the input velocity dispersion @xmath71 .",
    "the upper panels show the results for a low value of the _ bias _ parameter ( 0.1 ) , while the bottom panels show the corresponding plots for a high _ bias _ value ( 0.4 ) .",
    "the code is very efficient in recovering the input values in the case of a low _ bias _ parameter .",
    "the lower plots show the same experiment when using a high value for the _ bias _ parameter and illustrate clearly that the algorithm underestimates the values of the high - order features if the penalty is too large .  in all cases",
    "the red line indicates the real value of the losvd and the vertical dashed lines mark the 3@xmath72(velocity scale ) limit , which is the point when the code starts becoming insensitive to any gaussian deviation .",

    "parameter described above must be adjusted delicately to prevent the ppxf code from losing the high - order features in the object spectrum .  for this",
    "we preformed a series of monte - carlo simulations in which we used a representative spectrum from our data to inspect the behaviour of the penalty function .",
    "first we used ppxf to fit a losvd to the object spectrum using no penalty function ( _ _ bias__=0 ) finding the un - biased values of @xmath74 .",
    "we then used these values as input and ran ppxf several times , each time convolving the object spectrum with a successively larger @xmath75 kernel .",
    "we repeated this process for different values of the _ bias _ parameter and found the maximum penalty value such that , for @xmath76(velocity scale ) , which is the lower limit at which the program becomes insensitive to any deviation from a gaussian absorption profile at any s / n @xcite , the mean difference between the output and the input parameters is well within the scatter of the simulation .",
    "we then choose this maximum value as the _ bias _ parameter .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ bias_test ] for two cases : one with a low penalty ( _ bias _",
    "= 0.1 ) and one with an overly high penalty ( _ bias _ = 0.4 ) .",
    "we observe that , as expected , a too large penalty can make the code lose information on the high - order features of the spectrum , such as @xmath77 and @xmath70 .",
    "our analysis shows that the value _ bias _ = 0.2 gives the best results .",
    "we use this _ bias _ value throughout all subsequent ppxf runs .",
    "the next step is to test the stability of the solution when varying the amount of spectral range used by the fit . for this",
    "we create an artificial single gaussian absorption line with a fwhm = 0.3 , which corresponds to the instrumental profile of the imacs spectra , and add poisson noise to obtain s / n = 70 ( see figure  [ snr_dist ] ) .",
    "we then perform the same simulation as above , i.e.  we convolve the absorption line to reproduce an arbitrary losvd and then try to recover the parameters using the same original artificial line as a template .",
    "the key variable here is the amount of pixels ( i.e.  continuum ) that we include in the fit .",
    "the spectral resolution of our resampled imacs data is 0.1  / pix .",
    "thus , a typical fitting range of 100 pixels corresponds to 10 .",
    "we find that for different spectral ranges the code is able to recover @xmath58 and @xmath45 to within about @xmath78 km s@xmath7 when the absorption line is broader than @xmath79 km s@xmath7 , and to within about @xmath80 km s@xmath7 when the absorption line has @xmath81 km s@xmath7 .",

    ", we also include template stars with moderate ( @xmath95 km s@xmath7 ) , fast ( @xmath9 km s@xmath7 ) , and extremely fast ( @xmath96 km s@xmath7 ) rotational velocities in order to properly fit bsss with high rotational velocities .",
    "similar to what is described for the standards , we calculate the final @xmath4 for a star by taking the error - weighed average @xmath45 value of the fit of four , or less , spectral regions , depending on each spectra due to chip gaps and the quality of the fit .",
    "each of these values is in turn a median value from ten fits , each of these having different sizes of the spectral range typically between 100 and 300  .",
    "we plot the measurements from the fittings around each spectral region and compare them with the mean final value , @xmath97 , to check how well constrained our results are and also to test for any strong dependence with the spectral region of the fit .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ sigmas_compare ] for each bss in each gc .",
    "the error bars on the y - axis come from taking the 1-@xmath45 deviation in the set of ten values . given that the wavelength ranges of the fit change in each run , therefore varying the amount of potentially bad pixels ( specially close to the chip gaps ) , we are vulnerable to spurious solutions , which most of the times are left out when taking the median , but that affects the overall statistical uncertainty .",
    "the large error bars in @xmath0cen are mainly due to this effect , since these spectra are of the lowest s / n given the high level of crowding and difficult sky subtraction in each slit .",
    "for the other two gcs , however , we note that the expected errors can account for most of the dispersion between different measurements , and also the unity relation seems to hold for all spectral ranges in all gcs .",
    "this , in turn , rules out the possibility of any strong bias in @xmath4 introduced by the fit of a particular spectral region .",
    "we interpret this last result also in favor of including regions around the balmer lines as acceptable @xmath4 estimators even though the balmer lines themselves are very sensitive to gravity and temperature variations .",
    "in fact , we find that if we select a pair of bsss from the same gc which have very similar colors ( therefore we assume similar metallicity and temperature ) and different estimated rotational velocities , the spectral profile of the h@xmath89 and h@xmath90 lines are almost identical between a fast and a slow rotating bss , except for the shape of the bottom of the line , which gets smoothed with fast rotation ( see figure  [ comp_balmer ] ) .",
    "the fitting will be , therefore , mostly determined by the finer absorption features and by the shape of the bottom of the balmer lines .  as a final check",
    ", we note that the mgii4481 line should be ideal for @xmath4 measurements in late a type stars given that it is free from strong pressure broadening @xcite .",
    "therefore , the consistency observed in figure  [ sigmas_compare ] is suggesting that , within the errors , we can use the regions around the balmer lines as reliable indicators .     and",

    "km s@xmath7 .",
    "the difference in photometric color is @xmath98=0.04 mag , therefore implying very similar effective temperatures .",

    "the red solid curves illustrate non - parametric probability density estimates using an epanechnikov kernel function together with their 90% confidence limits shown as dotted curves .",
    "note that the probability density estimate takes into account the uncertainties of the individual measurements . due to the lower s / n of the ngc5139 measurements the curves appear less peaked than for the other two gcs .",
    "the two labeled bsss ( a5 and c1 ) with extreme @xmath4 values correspond to those labeled in figure  [ rad_vel_3].,width=336 ]    the final @xmath4 distribution for each gc is shown in figure  [ rot_dist_3 ] , while the values are listed in table  [ tab : n3201 ] , table  [ tab : n5139 ] and table  [ tab : n6218 ] , for ngc3201 , @xmath0cen and ngc6218 , respectively .",
    "the cases of ngc3201 and ngc6218 are similar , in the way that both show the peak of the distribution around @xmath99 km s@xmath7 .",
    "approximately 90% of the distributions for these gcs are found in the range of between 10 km s@xmath7 and 50 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the other 10% of bsss , which have @xmath9 km s@xmath7 , lie in the long tail of the distribution which goes up to @xmath100 km s@xmath7 for ngc6218 and up to @xmath101 km s@xmath7 for ngc3201 .",
    "note that in these gcs , the fastest rotating bsss are outliers in the radial velocity distribution , which could also be a clue to their formation history .",
    "the case of @xmath0cen is different since it shows a @xmath4 distribution slightly shifted towards higher rotational velocities .",
    "the bulk of its distribution function is between 20 and 70 km s@xmath7 , with a peak around 30 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this bulk contains 80% of the total sample and the remaining bsss form a tail of the distribution function with @xmath4 values up to @xmath102160 km s@xmath7 . for this massive gc",
    ", the fraction of bsss with @xmath9 km s@xmath7 corresponds to 30% , in agreement to what was reported in @xcite for their sample .",
    "we note that , contrary to what is normally found , we find no bsss rotating slower than 10 km s@xmath7 , and , in the case of @xmath0cen , no bsss rotating slower than 20 km s@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we may be systematically overestimating the @xmath4 for slow rotators",
    ".  one possible explanation of such a relatively high lower @xmath4 cut - off might be simply due to our sample selection .",
    "another reason might be that our @xmath4 calibration ( figure  [ stands_sigma ] ) which is based on late - type stars to fix the slow rotating end of the @xmath4 parameter space , is affected significantly different than in the hotter target bsss , probably due to large differences in the micro and macro - turbulence , as well as in the temperature broadening between late and early type stars , which could well be of the order of 10 km s@xmath7 .",
    "since we concentrate on distribution functions of slow and fast rotators and only care about distinguishing between them , we do not expect this issue to affect any of our conclusions based on the differential analysis .",
    "one of the strongest clues to understanding the nature of bsss comes from their spatial distribution in gcs .",
    "the radial distribution profiles of the bss fractions are clearly bimodal for many gcs @xcite , but much flatter for others @xcite .",
    "this radial density profile morphology was recently claimed to be tightly related to the dynamical state of the parent gc @xcite .  at the same time , many ideas were put forward regarding the dependence of this distribution on the environment for different bss formation channels @xcite . in particular , it was claimed that mass transfer bsss would form preferentially in the loose outskirts of gcs where the low stellar densities would allow binary systems to survive long enough to transfer sufficient stellar material from the donor star , while such binaries would get disrupted much more rapidly in the dense cluster cores .",
    "in contrast , bsss formed through collisions were expected to be found preferentially in gc cores , where the stellar densities are high enough for these relatively rare events to actually occur at significant rates @xcite .",
    "this scenario has not yet clearly been demonstrated observationally to be at work , and evidence so far is very unclear about the spatially dependent importance of the different bss formation channels due to the fact that both types of bss populations are simultaneously present in a gc .     for bsss in ngc3201 ( _ red triangles _ ) , ngc5139 ( _ black diamonds _ ) , and ngc6218 ( _ blue squares _ ) .",
    "the symbol sizes are parametrized by the radial velocity offset with respect to the systemic velocity of the host gc and are scaled as shown in the upper right .",
    "the dashed vertical lines indicate the central velocity dispersion of each gc , color coded as the symbol color . the two labeled bsss correspond to the ones in figures  [ rad_vel_3 ] and [ rot_dist_3 ] .",
    "note that for ngc5139 we lack spatial coverage beyond @xmath103 and , thus , do not cover the outermost regions ( see also figure  [ cmd1]).,width=321 ]    the large spatial coverage of our bss sample allows us to search for spatial correlations between @xmath4 and the cluster - centric radius .",
    "this may unveil differences in the two populations identified by their @xmath4 signatures : bsss that belong to the bulk of the @xmath4 distribution , i.e.  with rotational velocities around @xmath104 km s@xmath7 and rapidly rotating km s@xmath7 , unless it is stated otherwise . ] bsss with @xmath11 km s@xmath7 .  in figure  [ vsini_dist ]",
    "we plot the bss @xmath4 values against their projected cluster - centric distance in units of the gc core radius , adopting the values @xmath105 , and @xmath106 for the core radius of ngc3201 , ngc5139 , and ngc6218 , respectively , taken from the 2010 update of @xcite .",
    "we find that , with the exception of two bsss in @xmath0cen , all fast rotating bsss are significantly concentrated within @xmath107 , while bsss with @xmath108 km s@xmath7 populate the entire spatial extent of their parent gc .",
    "this relation also holds for bsss with @xmath4 below and above 50 km s@xmath7 ( the usual fast rotator limit ) in ngc 3201 and ngc 6218 .",
    "we also show , as vertical dashed lines , the central velocity dispersion of each gc in order to asses the possibility of star blending causing the inner bsss to appear artificially as fast rotators .",
    "we see that , in all three gcs , the velocity dispersion is significantly smaller than the rotational velocities of the fastest bsss and therefore unable to be causing this spatial pattern .",
    "interestingly , the fastest rotators in ngc3201 ( a5 ) and ngc6218 ( c1 ) have anomalous radial velocities and are located , in projection , even deeper in the cluster center at @xmath109 . like the two fast rotators in @xmath0cen at @xmath110",
    ", these two rapidly rotating bsss could possibly be in the early stage of ejection from their host gcs , given their projected locations and radial velocity offsets with respect to their parent stellar system .",
    "on the other hand , if the two fast rotators in @xmath0cen at @xmath110 were also formed in the inner regions , then they are possibly already well in the process of ejection . in agreement with this , we find that the furthest out of the two has a radial velocity of 288.3 km s@xmath7 , right on the edge of the radial velocity distribution of @xmath0cen ( see figure  [ rad_vel_3 ] ) . another interpretation is simply that fast rotating bsss form at the same rate both in the outskirts and in the central core of its parent gc , and they later sink down into the inner regions due to mass segregation processes .",
    "our data favors the first scenario , the one in which fast rotating bsss form preferentially in the inner regions , since , in all three gcs , we find slow rotating bsss distributed across the entire cluster s spatial extent with a certain underlying density profile , while fast rotators seem to depart from such a profile into a much more concentrated one .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test has been performed on the slow- and fast - rotating bss subsamples and it was found that the hypothesis in which the group consisting of bsss with @xmath11 km s@xmath7 and the one with @xmath108 km s@xmath7 are drawn from the same cluster - centric density distribution has a p - value @xmath111 . this is consistent with our idea that fast rotating bsss are indeed located preferentially in the deeper regions of these clusters .",
    "the same test was performed for the individual clusters and we found a p - value @xmath112 for ngc3201 and ngc6218 , while ngc5139 gives a p - value @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , even for the individual samples we find that the radial distributions of fast rotating bsss are consistent with being shifted towards the inner regions compared to the radial distribution of slow rotating bsss .     value . note that bluer bsss are preferentially faster rotators than redder bsss .",
    "this is best seen in @xmath0 cen .",

    "as stated in the last paragraph , we think our results can be linked to the same phenomenon , where the progenitors of some fast - rotating bsss in our sample experienced a recent interaction event in the gc core regions that put them on a hyperbolic trajectory , kicking the bss out of the gc gravitational potential at relatively high velocities ( @xmath114 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "as will be show in a future paper of this series , we find typical bss masses in the range of @xmath115 in our sample gcs .",
    "we use the stellar evolution models of @xcite to estimate the typical spin - down timescales for stars in this mass range and find that the longest spin - down time to reach equatorial rotational velocities below @xmath116 km s@xmath7 is about @xmath117 myr for @xmath118 stars and decreases to @xmath119 myr for a @xmath120 star .",
    "in addition to this internal stellar dynamics estimate , we use a back of the envelope calculation including the quantities provided in @xcite and @xcite to compute the escape times from the gc centre out to the tidal radius for the two rapidly rotating bsss in ngc3201 ( a5 ) and ngc6218 ( c1 ) .",
    "our calculations give an upper limit of @xmath121 kyr for these bsss to escape their parent gcs , which would mean that these two rapidly rotating bsss , if indeed were formed in the core , must have been formed no longer than some hundred thousands years ago , assuming also that the dynamical interaction which set them at high velocities was the same that caused their formation .",
    "similarly , the bss in @xmath0cen located at @xmath110 and with high relative radial velocity previously mentioned could have migrated to its projected location after @xmath29200 kyr if it started its ejection at @xmath291@xmath26 .",
    "hence , we suggest that these rapidly rotating bsss that are likely in the process of ejection must have experienced strong dynamical interaction no longer than @xmath2910@xmath122 yrs , which would set a very significant constraint on their age , if we assume that these dynamical interaction were also responsible for their formation .  more generally , based on the spin - down timescale estimates , we suggest that the observed rapidly rotating bsss with @xmath11 km s@xmath7 formed in strong dynamical interaction events in the central regions of their host gcs no longer than @xmath12 myr ago",
    ".      the cmd location of bsss in relation with their parent gc s stellar population can be a powerful tool for determining their formation history . in figure  [ cmd_vsini ]",
    "we plot the cmds of our target gcs and explicitly show the bss @xmath4 values in order to search for global trends .",
    "even though slow and fast rotators are spread over all colors and magnitudes , an unexpected global trend seems to hold for ngc5139 : the fastest rotating bsss are preferentially bluer than the slower rotating bsss .",
    "we illustrate this more clearly in figure  [ color_vsini ] where we plot the bss @xmath4 vs.  their dereddened @xmath13 color , i.e. @xmath123 .",

    "the number of blue bsss is smaller and a larger sample is required to decide whether a similar trend exists in these gcs . in any case , the majority of red bsss with colours @xmath126 mag show a significantly smaller @xmath4 dispersion than their blue counterparts with few outliers at high @xmath4 values .",
    "we defer the discussion of correlations between @xmath4 values and stellar masses and ages to a future paper , but point out that there is an apparent @xmath4 dichotomy between cool and hot bsss .",
    "colors versus @xmath4 values for our sample bsss in each target gc , ngc3201 , ngc5139 , and ngc6218 .",
    "note significant increase of the @xmath4 dispersion in ngc5139 for bss colors @xmath125 mag .",

    "the lower limit of the @xmath4 distributions ( and hence , their peaks ) seem higher than what is found in other gcs and we argue that this could be due to either our sample selection , or due to a systematical overestimation of @xmath4 for the slowest rotating bsss by @xmath2910 km s@xmath7",
    ".  this , in any case , would not affect our conclusions based on comparative analysis ( fast versus slow rotating bsss ) .  for all gcs , we find rapidly - rotating bsss with @xmath11 km s@xmath7 , which are predominantly found in the central regions of their parent gcs and have sometimes differential radial velocities that are consistent with stars in the process of being ejected from their host stellar systems through hyperbolic orbits .",
    "we discuss the spin - down timescales of these rapidly - rotating bsss using calculations for main - sequence stars with equivalent stellar masses and compare them to calculations of the dynamical ejection timescales from their host gcs .",

    "this is the first time that photometric properties can be related to dynamical properties of bsss , such as their rotational and differential radial velocity .",
