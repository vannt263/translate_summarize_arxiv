    "finally , ( c ) follows from ( a ) .",
    "several rank - level ( or `` strange '' ) dualities have been proposed by many authors ( inspired by work in mathematical physics e.g. , @xcite ) , over smooth pointed curves . in genus @xmath254 these take the form of isomorphisms ( well defined up to scalars ) over @xmath285 of the form , for suitable conformal embeddings @xmath907 , and @xmath908 @xmath909 these projective isomorphisms are defined only on the interior @xmath285 .",
    "for example , there is an isomorphism on @xmath285 @xcite , well defined up to scalars , of the form ( @xmath910 is essentially the transpose up to diagram automorphisms ) @xmath911    while our critical level symmetries are reminiscent of this  strange duality \" , the bundles @xmath332 and @xmath912 on @xmath316 are not dual , and often have different ranks . because they are both globally generated , their first chern classes are base point free , and hence effective . for two effective divisors to be dual , would mean they are trivial .",
    "moreover , the classical duality can ( eventually ) be viewed as a special case of the general strange duality given above ( see remark [ mondayremark ] ) .",
    "we could say that the critical level identities of this paper are orthogonality relations  via \" the strange duality .",
    "so whenever both sides of are classical , i.e. , coincide with co - invariants , there is perhaps a symmetry of conformal blocks divisors ( at levels @xmath913 , @xmath914 for @xmath915 and @xmath916 ) .",
    "however , in @xcite , the third author studies identities that do come from standard level - rank dualities associated to conformal embeddings of affine lie algebras .",
    "very roughly speaking , a conformal embedding of affine lie algebras @xmath907 producing a level rank duality , gives rise to a corresponding relation of conformal blocks divisors which takes the shape : @xmath917 where @xmath918 is a sum of boundary and @xmath919 classes and @xmath920 , determined by the embedding .",
