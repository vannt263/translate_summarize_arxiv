    "collisions at lhc will hopefully answer many so far unanswered questions about standard model and beyond . here",
    "we focus on details of jet production at lhc due to valence quark - gluon interaction .",
    "this process is of interest since it may shed light on so called phenomenon of saturation and it may test different factorisation schemes .",
    "this process will be measured at central and forward calorimeters ( castor in cms ) .    in first step",
    "we calculate hard matrix element for for @xmath1 , then we calculate the total cross section and show the differential cross sections as functions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 distribution of produced jets . to calculate jet production we use cascade monte carlo event generator @xcite",
    "we begin our study by calculating matrix element for @xmath1 ( this has been calculated in @xcite but in a different contest ) . in our studies",
    "we assume regge kinematics which means that we are going to work in regime where the total center of mass energy squared of proton - proton collision is much larger than any other scale involved in the collision .",
    "this practically means : @xmath4 where : @xmath5 ( see figure 1 ) . to calculate the amplitude we have to sum expressions for diagrams in figure 1 .",
    "we proceed by using sudakov decomposition of four momenta : @xmath6 + @xmath7 + @xmath8 + @xmath9 + where @xmath10 is longitudinal momentum fraction of incoming quark , @xmath11 is a longitudinal momentum fraction of incoming gluon ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath0 is its transverse momentum .",
    "@xmath13 is a longitudinal momentum fraction of outgoing quark , @xmath14 is its transverse momentum .",
    "@xmath15 is a longitudinal momentum fraction of outgoing gluon , @xmath16 is its transverse momentum . in calculations of matrix element",
    "the interesting kinematical regime is where the incoming gluon carries low longitudinal momentum fraction ( @xmath12 ) and we can make the eikonal approximation to the current . on the other hand",
    "since the incoming quark carries high momentum fraction ( @xmath17 ) we take the exact expression for the current . the resulting formula for the matrix element squared for @xmath18 for unpolarized quarks and gluons , after summing and averaging over colors of final and initial state particles , reads :    ( 490,170 ) ( 10 , -160 )    @xmath19    from the expression for the matrix element squared we can see that in addition to term formally equal to the collinear result we get a term proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "this matrix element has interesting structure of singularities .",
    "singularities appear in 4 different points in the phase space when one of the final state partons four - momentum is collinear with a four - momentum of a quark in the initial state ( taking also the quark with the momentum @xmath21 into account ) .",
    "the cross section in @xmath0 factorisation approach can be schematically written as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for integration over longitudinal , angular and transversal degrees of freedom , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the factorisation scales . in the formula above @xmath26 is the unintegrated , gluon density    obtained by solving the ccfm evolution equation and @xmath27 is the unintegrated valence quark density obtained from ccfm - like equation which is needed for technical reasons in monte carlo simulation .",
    "the initial valence quark distribution is provided by cteq 6.1 set . in our calculations we use running coupling constant and",
    "we make a @xmath28 cut on transverse momenta of out going jets .",
    "this cut is motivated by the experimental setup where jets at lower momenta are hardly measurable .",
    "this cut removes the collinear configuration singularities of the matrix element . as a first observable we calculated total cross section for two jet production in considered kinematical region and we obtained @xmath29 .",
    "as other observable we investigate the rapidity distributions of the produced jets .",
    "the results of the calculation of the rapidity distributions of outgoing partons is presented in figure 2 . as expected , the quark initiated jet is in the forward rapidity region while the gluon initiated jet is in the central rapidity region .",
    "we make here a comparison to pythia monte carlo prediction .",
    "the difference between distributions is due to missing sea quark contribution in cascade .",
    "the other interesting observable is the transverse energy @xmath2 ( figure 4 ) and @xmath3 distributions ( figure 5 ) of produced jets .",
    "the first of this distributions is of particular importance because it shows visible difference due to different assumptions about underlying physics .",
    "for example one sees that cascade including the off shell matrix element favors a harder spectrum than pythia which is based on collinear factorisation .",
    "the @xmath3 distributions generated by cascade and pythia differ because missing sea quarks in our approach .",
    "however , this difference is small in region of our interest ( large @xmath2 ) .",
