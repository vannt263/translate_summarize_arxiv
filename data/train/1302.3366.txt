    "energy harvesting is the process by which energy is taken from the environment and transformed to provide power for electronics.@xcite specifically , thermoelectrics can play a crucial role in future developments of alternative sources of energy .",
    "unfortunately , present thermoelectric engines have low efficiency.@xcite therefore , an important task in condensed matter physics is to find new ways to harvest ambient thermal energy , particularly at the smallest length scales where electronics operate .",
    "utilizing the physics of mesosopic electron transport for converting heat to electrical power is surprisingly a relatively recent endeavor .",
    "while the general relationships between electrical and heat currents and their responses to applied voltages and temperature differences have been understood since the work of onsager,@xcite the investigation of thermoelectric properties , and in particular the design of nano - engines has taken the form of several fairly recent concrete proposals . in 1993 ,",

    "et al._@xcite resonant levels were also used as energy filters to make a related heat engine from an adiabatically rocked ratchet.@xcite humphrey _ et al .",
    "_ note their model can be generalized to a static , periodic ratchet , which is a quantum version of the model with state - dependent diffusion.@xcite references   show that a single resonant level is an ideal heat engine , and investigate power and efficiency in that system which has similarities to the present work .    .",

( b ) carnot efficient stopping ( open circuit ) configuration . ]",
    "coulomb - blockaded dots can be ideally efficient converters of heat to work , both in the two - terminal @xcite and three - terminal@xcite cases ; however , since transport occurs through multiple tunneling processes , the net current and power are very small . in light of the small currents and power produced by coulomb - blockaded quantum dots , open cavities with large transmission that weakly changes with incident electron energy",
    "have been considered.@xcite while this system produces more rectified current than coulomb - blockaded quantum dots , simply increasing the number of quantum channels does not help because the energy dependence of transmissions in typical mesoscopic conductors is a single - channel effect even for a many - channel conductor .",
    "hence , the rectified current and power drop as channel number is increased unless special engineering of the contacts is made .",
    "consequently , we should optimize the rectified current and electrical power for a strongly non - linear system , operating in the single channel limit .",
    "we do this here with the physics of resonant tunneling through barriers connected to the hot energy source .",
    "we show this achieves the maximum current a single channel can give , which we conjecture is the optimal configuration .",
    "importantly , in our model the energy source is separate from the electrical circuit , as is required for energy harvesting .",
    "therefore no charge is extracted from it and the optimal configuration is independent of the parameters of the energy source .",
    "this is different from single quantum dot proposals @xcite where the leads are held at different temperatures , and the amount of transferred heat depends on the lead chemical potentials .",
    "resonant tunneling is a quantum mechanical effect , where constructive interference permits an electron tunneling through two barriers to have unit transmission .",
    "this is only true if the electron has a particular energy equal to the bound state in the quantum dot , or within a range of surrounding energies , whose width is the inverse lifetime of the resonant state.@xcite electrons with any other energy are effectively forbidden from transmitting across the quantum dot . in this way ,",
    "a resonant tunneling barrier acts like an energy filter : only those electrons that match the resonant condition are permitted to pass .",
    "we assume for simplicity the resonant tunnel barrier ( or the dot ) is symmetrically coupled .",

    "et al . _ performed experiments on this system in its dual role as an electronic refrigerator.@xcite they demonstrated that applying bias to the system results in cooling a large cavity from to below .",
    "we are primarily interested in cavities made as small as possible while still having good thermal contact with the heat source .",
    "this further miniaturization permits many engines to be put in parallel and give a large output power .",

    "the model we consider ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) consists of a cavity connected to two quantum dots , each with a resonant level of width @xmath4 and energy @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the situation where the widths are equal , while the energy levels are different ( these are controlled by gate voltages ) .",
    "the energy difference @xmath6 is an important energy scale of our composite system , which we refer to as the _ energy gain_. it is distinct from the level spacing @xmath7 in the individual dots as well as from the level width .",
    "the nano - cavity the dots are connected to is considered to be in equilibrium with a heat reservoir of temperature @xmath0 that is hotter than the left and right electron reservoirs , having chemical potentials @xmath8 and equal temperatures , @xmath1 .",
    "we assume strong electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions relax the electron energies as they enter and leave the cavity , so the cavity s occupation function may be described with a fermi function , @xmath9)$ ] completely characterized by a cavity chemical potential @xmath10 and temperature @xmath0 , with @xmath11 being the boltzmann constant . this process of inelastic energy mixing is assumed to occur on a faster time scale than the dwell time of an electron in the cavity .",
    "thermal energy flows from the coupled hot bath into the cavity as a heat current , and keeps the temperature different from that of the electron reservoirs .",
    "the nature of the heat reservoir is not specified in this model , but refers quite generically to any heat source we wish to harvest energy from . our setup should be contrasted with the more widely studied two - terminal configurations in which electric and heat currents flow in parallel .",
    "our model permits a separate heat circuit to the central reservoir and a separate ( transverse ) electrical circuit .",
    "the chemical potential of the cavity and its temperature ( or equivalently , the incoming heat current ) are constrained by conservation of global charge and energy .",
    "these constraints are given by the simple equations , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 in the steady state , where @xmath14 is electrical current in the left or right contact , and @xmath15 the energy current .",
    "energy current is seemingly not conserved because of the heat current @xmath16 flowing from the hot reservoir .",
    "the currents @xmath17 , @xmath18 , are given by the well known formulas @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the transmission function of each contact for each incident electron energy @xmath22 . in our quantum dot geometry , the resonant levels give rise to a transmission function of lorentzian shape,@xcite t_j(e)= , where @xmath23 are the attempt frequencies of the two barriers of the resonant quantum dot(s ) . here",
    "we assume symmetric coupling for simplicity , @xmath24 , so @xmath4 is the width of the level , or inverse lifetime of an electron in the dot .",
    "note that the lorentzian energy dependence applies if the level width @xmath4 is small compared to the level spacing @xmath7 in the individual quantum dots .",
    "a crucial advantage of our setup which we will exploit later on is that it permits the use of small dots with a level spacing that is large compared to temperature but with the energy gain and level width of each dot on the order of the temperature .    in the limit where the width of the level is smaller than the thermal energy in the cavity / dot system , @xmath25",
    ", the transmission will pick out only the energies @xmath26 or @xmath27 in the above energy integral expressions for the currents giving simple equations . consequently",
    ", we have these equations for the conservation laws for charge and energy :    @xmath28 + e_r [ f_r - f_{\\text{c}r } ] ,   \\label{conservation2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . from these two equations",
    ", we can solve for ( say ) the quantity @xmath33 .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the electrical current through the left lead @xmath34 , the net current flowing through the system .    a solution of eqs . and to linear order in the deviation of the cavity s temperature and chemical potential from the electronic reservoirs indicates that the maximal power of the heat engine will be produced when the chemical potentials of the reservoirs are symmetrically placed in relation to the average of the resonant levels , @xmath35 .",
    "for this special case , an exact solution is possible because the constant solution @xmath36 for the cavity chemical potential satisfies the charge conservation condition for all temperatures .",
    "we now describe the physics of this nano - engine .",
    "we first focus on the regime @xmath37 , which can be analyzed analytically and will afterwards discuss the regime @xmath38 which we numerically find to yield the largest current and power . physically ,",
    "if an electron comes in the left lead at energy @xmath26 and exits the right lead with energy @xmath39 , it must gain precisely that energy difference @xmath40 .",
    "thus , in the steady state , any incoming heat current @xmath16 must be associated with an electrical current @xmath41 , with a conversion factor of the energy gain , @xmath42 , to the quantum of charge , @xmath3 , i = .",
    "this results holds regardless of what bias is applied or what the temperature is .",
    "the efficiency of our heat engine , @xmath43 , is defined as the ratio of the harvested electrical power @xmath44 to the heat current from the hot reservoir , @xmath16 . for our system",
    "it takes a particularly simple form , = .",
    "[ efficiency ]    in order to proceed further , we must find the chemical potential of the cavity and its temperature given in terms of the incoming heat current and chemical potentials and temperature of the electron reservoirs .",
    "these are found by employing the principle of conservation of global charge and energy , see eqs .   and .     for @xmath45 and level width @xmath4 and",

    "( d ) the optimized values are plotted versus @xmath47 . here , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "]    rather than considering the cavity temperature @xmath0 as a function of the heat current @xmath16 we are harvesting , we can turn our perspective around , and keep the cavity temperature @xmath0 fixed from being in thermal equilibrium with the hot energy source . with this insight",
    ", we can express the heat current @xmath16 in terms of the hot cavity temperature and other system parameters .",
    "we find in the limit where @xmath52 , j = [ f(e/2 , t _ ) - f(e/2 - /2 , t _ ) ] , [ jsol ] which satisfies charge and energy current conservation . in eq .",
    "( [ jsol ] ) , @xmath53 is planck s constant .    importantly , without bias there is a rectified electrical current given by i = e j / e [ ( k_b t_)^-1 - ( k_b t_)^-1 ] , [ isol ] in the limit where @xmath54 . this current is driven solely by the fixed temperature difference between the systems .",
    "we note both the heat and electrical current are proportional to @xmath4 , the energy width of the resonant level .",
    "consequently , the currents and power produced in this system will tend to be small since we have assumed that @xmath4 is the smallest energy scale .",
    "it is also clear that both are controlled by the size of @xmath42 , so increasing this energy gain will improve power until it exceeds the temperature .",
    "later we will generalize these results by numerically optimizing the power produced in this nano - engine .    in order to harvest power from this rectifier ,",
    "a load should be placed across it .",
    "equivalently , we could apply a bias @xmath55 to this system tending to reduce the rectified current . at a particular value , @xmath56 ,",
    "the rectified current vanishes , giving the maximum load or voltage one could apply to extract electrical power at fixed temperatures @xmath57 .",
    "this value is found when @xmath16 and @xmath41 vanish , given by eq . : _",
    "stop = e ( 1 - ) .",
    "[ stop ] consequently , the voltage applied must not be larger than @xmath58 and therefore from eq .",
    "( [ efficiency ] ) , the efficiency is bounded by @xmath59 . at the stopping voltage , the thermodynamic efficiency attains its theoretical maximum , the carnot efficiency , @xmath60 , showing this system is an ideal nanoscale heat engine .",
    "naturally , at this point [ see fig .",

    "is the efficiency at the bias point where power is maximum . for temperature",
    "larger than @xmath42 or @xmath61 , we can approximate the fermi functions to find @xmath62 , resulting in a parabola as a function of @xmath63 , with maximum power p_max , [ pmax ] and efficiency @xmath64 which is in agreement with general thermodynamic bounds for systems with time - reversal symmetry.@xcite      one can go beyond this limit for the efficiency by solving the conservation laws numerically .",
    "we optimize the total power produced by the heat engine by varying the resonance width @xmath4 , as well as the energy gain @xmath42 and applied bias @xmath65 , given fixed temperatures @xmath57 .",
    "these results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we define the average temperature @xmath66 , and its difference , @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we see that for @xmath68 the power increases as @xmath69 , as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ pmax ] ) , but then levels off and decays exponentially , attaining its maximum around @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , the choice @xmath71 gives optimal power .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath42 and the level width are two essentially independent energy scales in our system . as a matter of fact the energy gain",
    "@xmath72 is almost an order of magnitude larger than the level width @xmath73 .",
    "these considerations suggest an experimental strategy for maximizing the power of such a device : measure what the resonant level widths are , and tune the reservoir temperatures and energy gain ( with the help of gate voltages ) , to it .    from fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) we also see that the efficiency at maximum power drops from half the carnot efficiency to about 0.2@xmath60 when the parameters are optimized .",
    "however , we note that when @xmath4 is kept small , in the nonlinear regime the efficiency can exceed the bound @xmath74 found in the linear regime .",
    "this small drop in efficiency is more than compensated by the extra power we obtain .",
    "importantly , according to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the power reaches a maximum of @xmath75 , or about at @xmath76= , a two order of magnitude increase from a weakly nonlinear cavity .",
    "@xcite this jump in power can be attributed to the highly efficient conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy by optimizing both the level width and energy level difference .",
    "compared to a heat engine based on resonant tunneling through a single quantum dot in a strictly two - terminal geometry,@xcite our three - terminal energy harvester gains a factor of 2 in power while achieving the same efficiency . to give some perspective on this output ,",
    "if a square array of these nanoengines were fabricated , each occupying an area of , they would produce a power of , operating at @xmath76 = .",
    "$ ] leaving ( blue ) or entering ( red ) the central cavity vs temperature difference ( x axis ) and applied bias ( y axis ) divided by average temperature .",
    "the plot is for system parameters optimized for maximal power output , an energy gain of @xmath77 and level width @xmath78 .",
    "the green line is the @xmath79 curve for @xmath80 while the black curve is the @xmath79 line for the optimized @xmath4 .",
    "the system can work as a heat engine ( he ) in the blue region for @xmath81 ( configuration shown in the inset labeled he ) , or as a refrigerator ( r ) in the blue region for @xmath82 ( configuration shown in the inset labeled r ) .",
    "[ heatcurr ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ heatcurr ] , the heat current @xmath16 is plotted versus temperature difference and applied bias . there",
    "we find that when system parameters are optimized to give maximum power , the system can be operated in the mode of a heat engine ( he ) or a refrigerator ( r ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the case where the levels are narrow compared to the other energy scales [ and consequently the cavity can cool to arbitrarily low temperatures in principle ; see green solid line , eq .",
    "] , for this choice of parameters the cavity will only cool to the temperature where the @xmath79 curve ( solid black line ) bends back .    ]      in reality , there will be other quantum dot resonant levels the electron can occupy that are higher up in energy .",
    "we have assumed that the cavity temperature and applied bias are sufficiently small so transport through these levels can be neglected .",
    "our model is quite general , so it may be applied to both semiconductor dots in two - dimensional electron gases,@xcite as well as three dimensional metallic dots.@xcite this latter case is quite interesting since one can fabricate an entire plane of repeated nanoengines in parallel in order to scale the power.@xcite furthering this idea , for such a repeated array of cavities and quantum dots , one can connect all the cavities to make a single engine , see fig .",
    "[ swiss ] .",
    "the two boundary layers consist of planes of quantum dots , so electrons can only penetrate through them .",
    "these layers sandwich a hot interior region and separate it from the left and right cold exterior contacts .",
    "this is equivalent to taking a large cavity with two leads and scaling the power by adding more quantum dots ( rather than trying to add more channels to a single contact ) .",
    "interestingly , the layered structure can help to reduce phononic leakage heat currents that would otherwise reduce the efficiency of the system : phonons scatter efficiently at interfaces , and the random dot arrangement will further reduce phonon related heat losses .",
    "the sandwich engine fabricated with self - assembled quantum dots tolerates variations in width and fluctuations in energy levels , as we will see in the next section .",
    "here , we further investigate the self assembled quantum dot layered engine , and what some of its theoretical characteristics are under realistic fabrication conditions . the basic operating configuration for the engine is shown in fig .",
    "[ swisscheese ] .",
    "heat flows from the hot energy source we wish to harvest energy from into the engine , and is converted into electrical power , along with residual thermal energy , dumped into the cold temperature bath .",
    "the electrical current is carried by the cold thermal bath , where it powers a load and then completes the electrical circuit on the opposite cold terminal .",
    "the flow of heat out of the hot energy source will consequently tend to cool the hot source .",
    "the energy harvesting application we primarily have in mind is taking heat away from computer chips and running other devices on the chip itself .",
    "in electrical chips , thermal energy is an abundant and free resource .",
    "indeed , heat is not only free , it is a nuisance preventing further improvements on chip technology .",
    "the fact that the proposed heat engine not only harvests the thermal energy , converting some of it into electrical power , but also cools the hot source is therefore a side benefit to the proposal of including nanoscale heat engines as part of an emerging chip technology .    in the actual fabrication of a resonant tunneling nano - engine ,",
    "as long as there are only a few dots , the precise placement of the resonant levels can be controlled by gate voltages in order to maximize the power generated by the engine . however , as soon as we consider self - assembled quantum dots with charging energies and single - particle level spacings of the order of , @xcite thereby allowing the nano - engine to operate at room temperature , this kind of control is out of the question . to make such an engine ,",
    "there are several possible fabrication techniques that could be employed using layers of quantum dots and wells to have the resonant energy levels lower than the fermi energy on one side of the heat source , and higher on the other side .",
    "however , in all of these fabrication methods , the growth of quantum dots does not occur at a perfectly regular rate , so it is natural to expect there will be variation of the resonant energy level from dot to dot .",
    "we must then check whether this fact will degrade the performance of the engine , and if so by how much .        to answer this question",
    ", we consider the energy - resolved current arising from a number of electrons passing through @xmath83 quantum dots on the left and then the right layer .",
    "the total current coming from the left slice is given by @xmath84 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    ", @xmath85 is the transmission probability of quantum dot @xmath86 , which has a resonant energy level @xmath87 and a width @xmath88 , @xmath89 $ ] for symmetrically coupled quantum dots .",
    "since neither the left nor cavity fermi functions depend on the level placement , the sum over the quantum dots can be done to give an effective transmission function @xmath90 for the whole left slice .",
    "we can make further progress by assuming the fabrication process can be described as a gaussian random one , where the energy level @xmath87 is a random variable with an average of @xmath26 and a standard deviation of @xmath91 . for simplicity , we only consider random variation in @xmath87 , but there will also be variation in @xmath88 we ignore for the present . with this model",
    ", the effective transmission will have the average value    , the average energy gain between left and right dots .",

    "t_eff , l = n t_i(e , |e ) _ p = n d|e t(e - |e ) p_g(|e , ) , where @xmath94 is the gaussian distribution described above .",
    "thus , we see the effective transmission function is simply a convolution of the lorentzian transmission function and the gaussian distribution , known as a voigt profile .",
    "this leads to further broadening of the lorentzian width . with these considerations ,",
    "the conservation laws for charge and energy retain the same basic form as described in eqs .",

[ ensemblepower ] .",
    "the parameters are chosen so as to optimize the engine s performance without any randomness in the level position .",
