    "in 1872 , k.  weierstrass presented his famous example of a nowhere differentiable function @xmath0 on the real line @xmath1 .",
    "with two real parameters @xmath2 , this may be written as @xmath3 weierstrass proved that @xmath0 is continuous at every @xmath4 , but not differentiable at any @xmath4 if @xmath5 subsequently several mathematicians attempted to relax condition , but with limited luck . much later",
    "g.  h.  hardy @xcite was able to remove it :    [ w - thm ] for every real number @xmath6 the functions @xmath7 are bounded and continuous on @xmath1 , but have no points of differentiability .",
    "the assumption @xmath8 here is optimal for every @xmath9 , for @xmath0 is in @xmath10 whenever @xmath11 , due to uniform convergence of the derivatives .",
    "( strangely this was unobserved in ( * ? ? ? * sect .",
    "1.2 ) , where hardy sought to justify the sufficient condition @xmath12 as being more natural than eg . )",
    "hardy also proved that @xmath13 for @xmath14 so then the graph of @xmath15 is not rough at @xmath16 ( similarly @xmath17 if in addition @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , hardy s treatment is not entirely elementary and yet it fills ca .  15 pages .",
    "it is perhaps partly for this reason that attempts have been made over the years to find other examples .",
    "these have often involved a replacement of the sine and cosine above by a function with a zig - zag graph , the first one due to t.  takagi @xcite who introduced @xmath19 .",
    "however , the price is that the partial sums are not @xmath20 for such functions , and due to the dilations every @xmath21 is a limit @xmath22 where each @xmath23 is a point at which the @xmath24 partial sum has no derivatives ; whence nowhere - differentiability of the sum function is less startling .",
    "nevertheless , a fine example of this sort was given in just 13 lines by j.  mccarthy @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , there is an equally short proof of nowhere - differentiability for @xmath0 and @xmath25 , using a few basics of integration theory .",
    "this is explained below in the introduction .",
    "it is a major purpose of this paper to show that the simple method has an easy extension to large classes of nowhere differentiable functions .",
    "thus the main part of the paper contains two general theorems , of which at least the last should be a novelty , and it ends with new examples with slow increase of the frequencies .",
    "[ w - rem ] by a well - known reasoning , @xmath0 is nowhere - differentiable since the @xmath26 term can not cancel the oscillations of the previous ones : it is out of phase with previous terms as @xmath27 and the amplitudes decay exponentially since @xmath28 ; as @xmath2 the combined effect is large enough ( vindicated by the optimality of @xmath12 noted after theorem  [ w - thm ] ) .",
    "however , it will be shown in section  [ slow - sect ] that frequencies growing almost quadratically suffice for nowhere - differentiability .    to present the ideas in a clearer way",
    ", one may consider the following function @xmath29 which ( in this paper ) serves as a typical nowhere differentiable function , @xmath30 it is convenient to choose an auxiliary function @xmath31 thus : the fourier transformed function @xmath32 is chosen as a @xmath33-function fulfilling @xmath34\\tfrac{1}{2},2[\\,$ } ;      \\label{hatchi - eq}\\ ] ] for example by setting @xmath35 for @xmath36\\tfrac{1}{2},2[\\,$ ] .",
    "using it is easy to show that @xmath37 is continuous and that for each @xmath38 the function @xmath39 is bounded ( by @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath41 is integrable , ie @xmath42 , and clearly @xmath43 .    with this preparation ,",
    "the function @xmath29 is particularly simple to treat , using only ordinary exercises in integration theory : first one may introduce the convolution @xmath44 which is in @xmath45 since @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "secondly this will be analysed in two different ways in the proof of    [ ftheta - prop ] for @xmath48 the function @xmath49 is a continuous @xmath50-periodic , hence bounded function @xmath51 without points of differentiability .    by uniform convergence @xmath29",
    "is for @xmath52 a continuous @xmath50-periodic and bounded function ; this follows from weierstrass s majorant criterion as @xmath53 .",
    "inserting the series defining @xmath29 into , lebesgue s theorem on majorised convergence allows the sum and integral to be interchanged ( eg with @xmath54 as a majorant ) , ie @xmath55 here it was also used that @xmath56 for @xmath57 and equals @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath60 ( cf the note prior to the proposition ) this gives @xmath61 so if @xmath29 were differentiable at @xmath62 , @xmath63 would define a function in @xmath64 for which @xmath65 , and lebesgue s theorem , applied with @xmath66 as the majorant , would imply that @xmath67{~ } f'(t_0)\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}z\\chi(z)\\,dz    = f'(t_0)\\operatorname{i } \\frac{d\\hat \\chi}{d\\tau}(0)=0 ;    \\label{fint - eq}\\ ] ] hence that @xmath68 .",
    "this would contradict the assumption that @xmath69 .    by now this argument is of course of a classical nature , although not well established in the literature .",
    "eg , recently r.  shakarchi and e.  m.  stein treated nowhere - differentiability of @xmath29 in thm .",
    "3.1 of chap .  1 in their treatise @xcite with a method they described thus : `` the proof of the theorem is really the story of three methods of summing a fourier series  partial sums ",
    "cesaro summability  delayed means . ''",
    "however , they covered @xmath70 in a few pages with refinements for @xmath71 sketched there in problem  5.8 based on the poisson summation formula .",
    "the present proofs are not confined to periodic functions ( cf the next section ) , for the theory of lacunary fourier series is replaced by the fourier transformation @xmath72 and its basic properties .",
    "moreover , also hardy s theorem can be obtained in this way , with a few modifications .",
    "the main point is to keep the factor @xmath73 instead of introducing @xmath74 and @xmath75 that appear in @xmath0 and @xmath25 , but do not a priori stay away from @xmath58 as @xmath76 .",
    "luckily this difficulty ( which was dealt with at length in @xcite ) disappears with the present approach :    as @xmath9 , clearly @xmath77 . since @xmath27 it may in this proof be arranged that @xmath78 and @xmath79 only for @xmath80 . as for @xmath29",
    "this gives , by euler s formula , @xmath81 the term @xmath82 is redundant here , for @xmath83 yields @xmath84 , as @xmath85 vanishes on @xmath86-\\infty , 0]$ ] .",
    "so as in , one has @xmath87 .",
    "hence existence of @xmath88 would imply that @xmath89 ; cf . this would contradict that @xmath12 , so @xmath0 is nowhere differentiable .",
    "similarly @xmath15 is so .",
    "it is known that nowhere - differentiability of @xmath0 can be derived with wavelets , cf @xcite ; an elementary explanation has been given in @xcite , but only for @xmath90 . in comparison the above proofs are short and cover all cases through `` first principles '' of integration theory .    in section  [ micro - sect ] a general result on nowhere differentiable functions is given .",
    "refining a dilation argument , a further extension is found in section  [ diff - sect ] , including functions with polynomial frequency growth .",
    "borderline cases with quasi - quadratic growth are given in section  [ slow - sect ] .",
    "in the proof of theorem  [ w - thm ] , lebesgue s theorem on majorised convergence is the most advanced part . as this result appeared in 1908 ,",
    "cf @xcite , it seems that the argument above could , perhaps , have been written down a century ago .",
    "to emphasize _ why _ the proofs of proposition  [ ftheta - prop ] and theorem  [ w - thm ] work , the proof of the general theorem  [ exp - thm ] below will use the fourier transformation @xmath72 more consistently .    to apply @xmath72 to non - integrable functions",
    ", it is convenient to use a few elements of the distribution theory of l.  schwartz @xcite .",
    "( an introduction to this could be @xcite . )",
    "recall that @xmath91 defines a bijection @xmath92 , when @xmath93 denotes the schwartz space of rapidly decreasing @xmath33-functions .",
    "moreover , @xmath72 extends by duality to the space @xmath94 of so - called temperate distributions , which contains @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "in particular it applies to exponential functions @xmath97 , and as a basic exercise this yields @xmath50 times the dirac measure @xmath98 , ie the point measure at @xmath99 , @xmath100    this applies in a discussion of the function @xmath101 with general amplitudes @xmath102 and frequencies @xmath103 with @xmath104 , written @xmath105 for brevity .",
    "( there could be finitely many @xmath106 , but this would only contribute with a @xmath33-term . )    obviously the condition @xmath107 implies @xmath108 , so @xmath109 , and since @xmath72 applies termwise ( it is continuous on @xmath94 ) , one has by @xmath110 of course just expresses that @xmath111 is synthesized from the frequencies @xmath112    when @xmath113 , then each frequency may be picked out in a well - known way : fixing @xmath1141,\\liminf\\tfrac{b_{j+1}}{b_j}[\\,$ ] there is a @xmath115 for which @xmath78 while @xmath79 only for @xmath116 .",

    "the process in  has of course been known for ages , but with distribution theory it is fully justified although @xmath134 consists of measures . in principle , it is a banal example of what is sometimes called a _ second microlocalisation _ of @xmath111 , since @xmath135 is localised to frequencies @xmath136 restricted in _ both _ size and direction ; namely to @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "the second microlocalisation is more visible in a separate treatment of @xmath139 indeed , by euler s formula and , @xmath140 here multiplication by @xmath141 _ removes _ the contribution from @xmath142 since @xmath85 vanishes on @xmath86-\\infty , 0]$ ] .",
    "this actually explains why the proof of theorem  [ w - thm ] was saved by the redundancy of the term @xmath82 .",

    "the quasi - quadratic growth of @xmath218 is indicated by the fact that terms no .  1 , 10 , 100 , 1000 have frequencies 0.02 , 2.4 , 247 , 24326 , respectively .",
    "it may of course be shown analytically that , despite the larger number of @xmath364-dependent factors , one gets slower frequency growth in @xmath365 than in @xmath366 . figures  [ logg - fig ] , [ logn3-fig ] and [ logn4-fig ] indicate that as the frequency growth is reduced , there will be increasingly larger deviations from a sinusoidal curve .",
    "figure  [ logn4-fig ] shows the deviation from the first term , ie the sum over @xmath367 .",
    "notice that here the sinusoidal structure is almost completely lost , ie the first term is even less dominating .",
    "in addition to the vertical tangent at the origin in figure  [ logn4-fig ] , there seems to be approximate self - similarities , like those for @xmath302 analysed by j.  duistermaat @xcite .",
    "eg the behaviour for ca .",
    "@xmath368 seems similar to that found for @xmath369 and so on for @xmath370 .",
    "the first example of a nowhere differentiable function is due to b.  bolzano ( ca .",
    "1830 , discovered 1921 ) , cf the accounts in @xcite .",
    "nowhere - differentiability was established by means of infinite products in @xcite . for a review of the historical development of the subject",
    "the reader could consult the illustrated thesis of j.  thim @xcite . very recently",
    "nowhere - differentiable functions were shown to enter the counter - examples that establish the pathological properties of pseudo - differential operators of type  @xmath371 ; cf @xcite .",
    "it has turned out that some elements of the arguments exist sporadically in the literature ; cf remark  [ chub - rem ] for comments on @xcite .",
    "in particular @xmath372 and @xmath373 , @xmath71 have been analysed by y.  meyer ( * ? ? ?",
    "9.2 ) with a method partly based on wavelets and partly similar to the proof of proposition  [ ftheta - prop ] .",
    "the method was attributed to g.  freud but without any references .",
    "however , g.  freud showed in @xcite that an integrable periodic function @xmath111 with fourier series @xmath374 , @xmath375 is differentiable at a point only if @xmath376 , similarly to theorem  [ exp - thm ] .",
    "his proof was based on estimates of the differentiated cesaro means and of the corresponding fejr kernel ( as done also in @xcite ) , so it applies only to periodic functions .",
    "whereas the purpose in ( * ? ? ?",
    "9.2 ) was to derive the lack of differentiability of @xmath377 , @xmath378 with wavelet theory , the present paper goes much beyond this .",
    "eg nowhere - differentiability of @xmath29 , or @xmath0 , is shown to follow directly from basic facts in integration theory ; cf the introduction . and using only @xmath72 , differentiability was in theorem  [ exp - thm ] linked to the growth of the frequencies @xmath218 .",
    "finally , the removal of the condition @xmath379 in theorem  [ diff - thm ] seems to be a novelty , which yields that the growth of the frequency _ increments _ @xmath227 is equally important .",
