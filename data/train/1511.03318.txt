    "supernovae ( sne ) inject kinetic energy , momentum , and enriched ejecta into the interstellar medium ( ism ) and are thought to be one of the main sources of interstellar turbulence and galactic outflows .",
    "an important factor in understanding these processes is the evolution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) as their ejecta encounter various phases of the ism .",
    "for example , a large fraction of core - collapse sne from high - mass stars may explode promptly and interact with the molecular cloud ( mc ) from which they formed .",
    "this hypothesis suggests that the direct interaction between supernova ( sn ) ejecta and mcs , which we refer to as _ snr - mc interactions _ , may occur at a rate significantly higher than expected from the filling fraction of molecular gas in the ism @xcite . while it has been estimated that as many as half of all snrs have ejecta in physical contact with mcs @xcite , this estimate is highly uncertain and relies on a number of assumptions about massive stars , sne , and the relation between sne and mcs .",
    "detection of snr - mc interactions has traditionally relied on a number of methods for observing shocked molecular gas directly .",
    "strong , narrow emission from the oh @xmath5 maser ( @xmath6 ) is often detected in the vicinity of snrs , especially those with other signatures of snr - mc interactions @xcite .",
    "more recent surveys have established that targeted searches for oh maser emission may be a reliable method of searching for snr - mc interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to date , however , oh masers have only been detected toward @xmath7 of the 294 known snrs in our galaxy @xcite , although a lack of detailed spectroscopic information and localization makes it impossible to associate all of these detections with snrs .",
    "this low incidence relative to the expected rate of snr - mc interactions may be due to the unique physical conditions required for maser emission .",
    "oh @xmath5 masers are collisionally excited behind slow ( @xmath8 ) c - type shocks in regions with moderate temperatures and densities ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "studies of the warm , diffuse h@xmath11 regions around interacting snrs indicate that physical conditions are often outside this range @xcite .",
    "regions with higher shock velocities could also depopulate the hydroxyl @xmath12 state or dissociate the molecule entirely .",
    "convincing evidence of snr - mc interactions must come from other sources in these cases .",
    "internal flows within snrs are expected to become highly turbulent where the snr shock front interacts with the dense ism @xcite .",
    "molecular lines toward snrs , such as the rotational transitions of @xmath0co , should be velocity - broadened as a result of increased turbulence from a snr - mc interaction .",
    "shocked mcs are also known to exhibit asymmetric line profiles where these interactions occur @xcite .",
    "as opposed to the presence of oh @xmath5 maser emission , the detection of velocity - broadened , broad molecular line ( bml ) @xmath0co relies on more detailed spectroscopic information , especially in faint line `` wings '' where turbulent broadening is usually most apparent . at the same time , this type of observation offers insight into snr evolution and the physical properties of both sn ejecta and mcs .",
    "even if the studies of oh maser emission , bml emission , and other shock indicators are all taken together , only about 60 galactic snr - mc interactions have been identified . however , to date there has been no large - scale systematic survey for shock - broadened molecular lines . instead , the interactions have not been identified in a homogeneous manner , but are generally a result of investigations of individual snrs , notably ic 443 , w28 , w44 , ctb 109 , kes 69 , kes 79 , w51c , and cassiopeia a ( cas a ) @xcite .",
    "these sources span a wide range of ages and morphologies , from young , shell - like snrs such as cas a , through middle - aged and older ( @xmath13 ) remnants , and including mixed - morphology remnants and plerions .",
    "a systematic and unbiased survey of broadened co emission toward galactic snrs may yield a larger incidence of such interactions .",
    "the work described in this paper uses co emission for the first large - scale , systematic search for bml regions toward snrs . to interpret these observations",
    ", we developed an algorithm to identify regions of broadened @xmath0co @xmath2 emission where they exist toward each snr - mc system .",
    "we justify these identifications using the approximate systemic velocity at the distance inferred to each snr , an estimate of the `` broadened '' co emission , and the radio continuum morphology of the remnant itself . in this way",
    ", we have identified bml regions toward nineteen snrs in our sample , including nine newly identified candidate snr - mc interactions .",

    "the targets we observed are listed in .",
    "some targets listed in were selected for comparison to our larger sample .",
    "these snrs are well - studied and large ( diameter @xmath134 ) and in these cases we mapped a smaller subregion of the entire remnant .",
    "these targets include ctb 80 , ctb 1 , hb 3 , and ic 443 .",
    "ic 443 is a well - known snr - mc system , while hb 3 is suspected to have snr - mc interactions @xcite .",
    "reliable distances are critical when characterizing snrs . in order to draw an association between broad - line mcs and the snrs themselves ,",
    "a variety of distance indicators exist such as proper motion estimates , radial velocity ,  absorption , and ob associations , each with varying degrees of uncertainty .",
    "where the properties of snrs and their environments differ , distance indicators can yield estimates with significant disagreement . for example",
    ", the distance to g4.5@xmath46.8 ( kepler / sn 1604 ) has historically been controversial , with estimates ranging from around @xmath135 kpc @xcite to @xmath136 kpc @xcite , although proper motion estimates now favor the closer distance .",
    "this lack of agreement between various methods underscores the systematic uncertainties present in all distance indicators , from discrepant optical absorption @xcite to disagreement in the maximum optical brightnesses of historical sne @xcite .    for these reasons , we carefully chose distance indicators from among the literature , favoring those determined from proper motion estimates , kinematic estimates from  absorption and co associations , and line - of - sight x - ray absorption .",
    "the values we chose are given in and described in .",
    "however , for nineteen of the remnants in our survey , we were unable to find reliable distance indicators in the literature .",
    "for these objects , we resort to the surface brightness - size or @xmath137 relation @xcite .",
    "this empirical relationship describes snr evolution with time , whereby the radio surface brightness ( @xmath138 ) decreases monotonically while the physical diameter ( @xmath139 ) increases monotonically .",
    "thus , a power law relationship can be fit such that    @xmath140    @xmath141 and @xmath142 are calibrated using snrs whose distances are known from other methods . measuring the radio surface brightness and angular size of the snr",

    "distance measurements for some of the snrs in our sample are taken from this study where we adopt the authors most probable distance ( i.e. , the orthogonally fit value from table 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "these include sixteen out of the 50 snrs we observed .",
    "we provide our own estimates for the remaining three snrs , which we describe in .",
    "we mapped the vicinity of 50 snrs ( , ) with the 10 m smt using the alma - type sideband separating 1.3 mm receiver between 2013 april 21 and 2015 may 8 .",
    "apart from the size and average rms noise of each map as given in , the observations and reduction for each remnant were identical to those described in @xcite .",
    "as discussed in , there were several targets for which we did not observe the entire remnant .",
    "rather , we targeted either a region we knew to have broadened lines or an x - ray ( i.e. , @xmath144 ) bright region toward any known molecular emission .",
    "these objects were used either for comparison to other targets ( hb 3 , ic 443 ) or as a targeted search for new bml regions toward large remnants ( ctb 80 , ctb 1 ) .",
    "in particular , we targeted two regions of x - ray bright emission from ctb 1 , centered at @xmath145 with dimensions ( @xmath146 ) @xmath147 and at @xmath148 with dimensions @xmath149 . similarly , for hb 3 we targeted two regions centered at @xmath150 with dimensions @xmath147 and at @xmath151 with dimensions @xmath16 .",
    "these regions were centered on local x - ray enhancements as reported by @xcite . for the other large targets , we used single fields as reported in .",
    "we analyzed these four remnants and we indicate whether bml regions were detected in each case .",
    "however , given the fact that we did not map the entirety of each remnant and some were selected on the basis of previous evidence for snr - mc interactions , we discount all four in our discussion of snr - mc interactions ( except in ) as a possible source of bias .",
    "in our analysis , we used the @xmath152 resolution data , which has 512 channels for a velocity range of @xmath153 at @xmath154 . for a receiver tuned to the @xmath0co @xmath2 and centered at a systemic velocity of @xmath155",
    ", we can be reasonably certain that all galactic molecular emission along the line - of - sight is observed .",
    "the expected velocity range of the co spectrum at each distance is determined by assuming a @xmath156 uncertainty on the distances we assume to each snr , which agrees with typical fractional errors for distances calculated using the @xmath157 relation @xcite .",
    "comparison with the clemens rotation curve @xcite allows us to limit the velocity range over which mcs might exist that are interacting with a snr .",
    "we extend this range by @xmath158 at either end of the range in order to account for systematic errors in finding bml regions associated with snrs ( see , e.g. , ) .",
    "demonstrates this method for the known bml region toward 3c 391 . the distance to this snr",
    "is taken to be @xmath159 kpc , which at galactic coordinates @xmath160 corresponds to a systemic velocity range of @xmath161 to @xmath162 or @xmath163 to @xmath164 with the added velocity range .              within the range of permitted velocities for each snr , we imposed criteria on the line width and profile of observed molecular emission which we describe and justify in . in summary",
    ", these criteria are :    * we required co emission to be detected at @xmath165 ( the root mean square of emission in the line - free spectrum at each pixel as in ) in every spectral channel we used to calculate the line profile .",
    "* we used only five spectral channels for the width determination .",
    "* we required that the line profile not include secondary maxima .",
    "* we required the fwhm of observed @xmath0co lines @xmath166 .",
    "the purpose of these criteria was to identify regions of molecular emission that correspond with disturbed molecular gas where a snr - mc interaction has occurred .",
    "at the same time , we attempted to minimize false positives , e.g. due to molecular emission overlapping in velocity - space , and false negatives , e.g. where interactions are subtle and exhibit small velocity - widths , the co line is weak , or strongly asymmetric line profiles are present .      for clouds with sizes on the order of a few parsecs , quiescent @xmath0co line widths are typically @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we adopted a threshold of a @xmath168 fwhm to indicate bml regions .",
    "we evaluate and discuss the validity of this threshold in .    furthermore , bml regions can have asymmetric line profiles where the molecular gas has been shocked and accelerated .",
    "in addition to large line widths ( i.e. , @xmath169 ) at negative or positive velocities relative to the peak , the line profile is characterized by faint wings where turbulent acceleration of molecular gas is apparent .",
    "this line profile can be confused with multiple mcs along the same line - of - sight ( e.g. , toward the galactic center ) resulting in superimposed emission in the spectrum of a small region or even a single pixel .",
    "thus , identifying bml regions ideally relies on as small a region as possible with as few spectral channels as possible .    to account for line widths , asymmetry , and molecular emission from multiple sources along a line - of - sight",
    ", we developed an algorithm for identifying bml regions in @xmath0co @xmath2 .",
    "initially , we constructed a list of individual spectral channels by examining the spectrum at each pixel .",
    "where the @xmath0co emission in individual spectral channels exceeded @xmath170 and represented a local maximum , we flagged that channel for analysis .",
    "these flagged spectral features span the entire data cube and represent the line peaks of individual emission features in our data .    at @xmath154 and for a spectrum with @xmath152 resolution",
    ", the @xmath168 velocity - width threshold we adopted corresponds to a feature whose fwhm is @xmath171 or roughly five spectral channels .",
    "thus , to measure the line width of a broad feature , we required at least five channels or four channels in addition to the flagged local maximum of a spectral feature .",
    "confusion where a single spectral channel contains emission from multiple mcs can be problematic . in part , we minimized confusion by limiting the number of channels we used to measure line widths to the absolute minimum .",
    "however , this method does not preclude the scenario in which two molecular features with narrow widths ( i.e. , @xmath172 ) are separated by less than their half widths in velocity - space .",
    "therefore , in addition to the requirements described above , our algorithm stipulates that the emission on either side of the line peak must decrease monotonically in each channel and that the emission in each channel exceeds @xmath165 .    finally , using the five spectral channels around each flagged line peak , we measured the line widths using a method that accounts for possible asymmetries in the line profile .",
    "we took the spectrum at a particular pixel @xmath173 and channel @xmath174 corresponding to one of the flagged local maxima in our data cube . here , we use the antenna temperature at a particular pixel , @xmath175 .",
    "next , we measured the velocity centroid @xmath176 of the line peak around @xmath174 by calculating the first moment of the spectrum    @xmath177    we then evaluated the second moment of the spectrum in this range ,    @xmath178    this statistic is the velocity dispersion of the spectrum around the line peak . for a gaussian line profile , the fwhm @xmath179 .",
    "for comparison to other line indicators , we used the velocity - width statistic @xmath180 .",
    "if this value exceeds @xmath168 , the peak of the corresponding line profile is flagged in our data cube as a bml .",

    "therefore , we utilized a signal - weighted average to measure this value , for which the bml region velocity centroid ( @xmath190 ) is defined by the number of local maxima it includes ( @xmath191 ) , the gaussian amplitude of each local maximum ( @xmath192 ) , and the velocity centroid calculated ( @xmath193 as described in )    @xmath194    for newly discovered bml regions toward snrs , we report in the number of bml pixels we detect toward each remnant , the signal - weighted velocity centroid as described above , and the average velocity - width of all bml detections toward the snr .",
    "finally , we recalculated the distance to each remnant using the signal - weighted velocity centroid as a prior for the clemens rotation curve and we report this distance in .",
    "in order to resolve the distance ambiguity , we chose the distance closest to our original estimate from .",
    "the agreement between the distances reported in is variable , although nearly always within the @xmath156 uncertainty on the original estimate given the prior we used to find associated co emission ( ) . in some cases , these values are very close to the original distances , especially for g08.3@xmath30.0 , g18.6@xmath30.2 , 4c@xmath304.71 , and g29.6@xmath40.1 , where the distances were estimated from the @xmath157 relation for the first three objects and x - ray  column density for the latter .",
    "we applied our algorithm to two test cases involving known snr - mc systems : 3c 391 ( ) and cas a ( ) . in this way",
    ", we demonstrate the types of bml regions selected by our algorithm and the accuracy of the measurements .",
    "these two systems present unique problems that must be addressed in identifying bml regions in a large sample of @xmath0co @xmath2 data . here , we discuss previously detected signatures of bml regions toward each remnant and the underlying snr - mc interactions they may trace . from these examples ,",
    "we examine the extent to which our algorithm can be optimized .",
    "several observations of @xmath0co targeted on 3c 391 have revealed the presence of broadened molecular features from @xmath195 to @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "the emission exhibits significant broadening relative to the ambient gas , with @xmath0co @xmath2 line widths exceeding @xmath197 in some regions ( ) . this emission has consistently been interpreted as a signal of postshock gas .",
    "the molecular line profiles also exhibit a bright , narrow component ( @xmath198 ) at the same velocities and peaking in the same region .",
    "this observation suggests an association between molecules of significantly different temperatures and densities and presents a challenge when identifying regions of shocked molecular gas .",
    "one hypothesis for the presence of the narrow component is that it arises from cooler , less turbulent gas reforming behind a dissociative shock @xcite .",
    "that is , while the narrow component may be associated with the snr shock , in some regions it could be superimposed upon and dominate the line profile from the broadened emission . under this hypothesis",
    ", we might only detect bml regions where the snr - mc interaction is ongoing or recent .",
    "thus , detection of recently shocked gas in @xmath0co may be extremely sensitive to the criteria for identifying individual line components ( i.e. , local maxima ) in the spectrum . in our analysis",
    ", we selected all the local maxima in velocity - space whose signal exceeds @xmath170 . in this way ,",
    "our criteria are unbiased by the coincidence of narrow and bright line components with broad and faint components as in 3c 391 .",
    "one caveat is that false detections can occur where the local maxima are close together in velocity - space ; for example , we might report no detection if the narrow component was within @xmath199 spectral channels of the broad component . in this case , additional information on the line profile would be necessary to calculate an accurate line width .",
    "while this scenario does not occur in 3c 391 , one could imagine dissociated molecular gas reforming behind a shock whose narrow emission peaks at roughly the same systemic velocity as the undissociated , turbulently broadened component . as a follow - up to our initial analysis , we modified our requirement for the five channels to include scenarios where the line profile does not decrease monotonically for two channels on either side of the local maxima . while we still required five velocity channels , we extended the channel window on either side of the line profile to avoid contamination from other emitting regions in velocity - space .    as we demonstrate in ( left ) , the well - studied , shocked mc toward 3c 391 is located to the south of the remnant along a region of bright radio continuum . the @xmath0co spectrum in this region",
    "is significantly broadened in a feature centered around a systemic velocity of @xmath200 as seen in ( right ) .",
    "our data is of sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to resolve and confirm the narrow and broad spectral features toward this cloud .",
    "another important point that arises when examining similar bml regions is that the @xmath200 line appears to lie outside the velocity range inferred for an object at @xmath201 and @xmath202 , and the broad profile itself is at least @xmath158 from the maximum velocity allowed within this range .",
    "the remnant appears to be near the tangent point of the galactic rotation curve at this velocity ( @xmath162 ) , but the mc is slightly redshifted with respect to this velocity .",
    "given that the shock interaction with the mc has been confirmed in multiple wavelengths and is generally assumed to be associated with the remnant , one hypothesis for the velocity discrepancy is that remnants may accelerate mcs in an ongoing interaction .",
    "this point underscores the need for care in treating snr - mc interactions whose distances are near the tangent point of the rotation curve along a particular line - of - sight .",
    "as we describe in , we extend the velocity window used as a prior in our co spectra by @xmath158 at either end to account for this potential problem toward other snrs .",
    "cas a exhibits subtle indications of a snr - mc interaction in several ways",
    ". warm co gas ( t @xmath203 ) directly to the west of the snr implies some source of energy to heat the cloud @xcite .",
    "there is also a correlation between the brightest portions of the radio shell at @xmath204 , nonthermal x - ray emission , and the radio spectral indices in the same region suggesting that the ejecta are encountering a denser medium @xcite . in the near - infrared k@xmath205 band ,",
    "strong nonthermal emission occurs in the same regions @xcite .",
    "these observations are consistent with an interaction scenario , although they do not conclusively point to the presence of a snr - mc interaction .",
    "recent results indicate that hard x - ray emission above @xmath206 toward cas a is dominated by the western half of the remnant @xcite .",
    "knots of bright emission in nonthermal emission are consistent with steep spectral indices in the x - ray and some change in the physical environment .",
    "these knots are coincident with bright radio emission and the large mc to the west of cas a. further evidence of an ongoing interaction scenario may come from changes in this and other nonthermal emission on short timescales .    in the mc itself , h@xmath11co absorption studies suggest that certain species are broadened to as much as @xmath207 @xcite .",
    "similarly , slight broadening in @xmath0co @xmath208 up to @xmath209 is observed @xcite , while line widths in @xmath0co @xmath2 range from @xmath210 @xcite .",
    "thus , evidence for a snr - mc interaction toward cas a is strongly correlated in the x - ray , radio , near - infrared , and sub - millimeter , but the overall result in @xmath0co @xmath2 is subtle . in order to detect bml regions toward similar snr - mc interactions ,",
    "we must rely on a precise constraint in the velocity - width .    optimizing this constraint",
    "might be achieved by comparison with narrow molecular emission in the same field .",
    "line widths of narrow components in the cas a field range from @xmath211 , or about half of the `` broadened '' line widths .",
    "therefore , one criterion for `` broadened '' emission might be : can we divide these emission lines into distinct `` narrow '' and `` broad '' categories ?",
    "for example , how sensitive is the identification of bml regions to the velocity - width constraint we applied in ?",
    "we illustrate this point in ( right ) where we compare broadened features to unbroadened emission as determined by our analysis . the regions with the broadest @xmath0co line widths are qualitatively different from regions with narrow molecular lines .",
    "furthermore , we report the total number of pixels selected by the bml algorithm for newly identified bml regions in , which includes pixels that were ruled out as potential bml regions by the criteria described in . for newly identified bml regions",
    ", the algorithm selects these pixels with little contamination from other positions .",
    "that is , the total number of bml pixels identified using the criteria described in is generally @xmath212 the number of bml pixels we determine are associated with the snr as described in .",
    "we interpret this result to mean that a @xmath168 velocity - width threshold may be close to optimal for identifying bml regions toward snrs and therefore minimizes false positives from spurious detections of , for example , overlapping molecular lines .",
    "@xcite compare molecular line studies to other traditional detection methods for snr - mc interactions .",
    "these include detection of the oh @xmath5 maser , morphological correspondence between a snr and a mc , molecular line emission with a large high - to - low line ratio such as @xmath0co @xmath213 , detection of near - infrared emission from shock excitation such as [ fe ii ] or h@xmath11 emission , and infrared colors consistent with molecular shocks .",
    "it is valuable to utilize as many of these indicators as possible , and in our analysis we rely on morphological correspondence between the snr in radio emission and the mc as well as reports of oh @xmath5 maser emission .",
    "however , the detection of broadened @xmath0co line emission is a unique tool for tracing snr - mc interactions in our galaxy .",
    "spectroscopic information is vital for identifying the systemic velocity of molecular gas and therefore associating the kinematic distance to molecular emission with distances to snrs .",
    "this information reduces the probability of confusion by any chance alignment of a shock tracer with a snr .",
    "carbon monoxide is also the second most abundant molecule and possesses one of the highest bond - dissociation energies of any diatomic molecule .",
    "therefore , we would expect co to be more easily visible and less susceptible to dissociation behind a snr shock than oh , h@xmath11 or any other molecular shock tracer . finally , broad , low - j co emission is a direct tracer of disturbed gas in a mc , as opposed to line emission from atomic species or near - infrared colors which do not directly or unambiguously trace the molecular gas . probing the mc for molecular shocks and",
    "then drawing an association with the snr is well - suited for finding snr - mc interactions , even in a large survey .",
    "we applied the bml region algorithm to the @xmath0co @xmath2 spectra ( ) toward all 50 snrs in our sample to determine the location of broadened co features .",

    "these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive , and indeed , the former might provide an explanation for the delay between sn explosions and snr - mc interactions . the evolution of the snr - mc interaction rate with age provides a way of disentangling each possibility and its underlying cause .",
    "for example , one explanation of the low snr - mc interaction rate may be a large , distinct population of runaway massive stars .",

    "a star migrating directly away from its parent cloud at @xmath370 over @xmath371 yr , a subsequent core - collapse sn would explode roughly @xmath372 pc from its starting position .",
    "thus , the time between explosion and snr - mc interaction would be delayed by approximately @xmath373 ( i.e. , the age at which a snr has a radius of @xmath374 ) .",
    "age is a critical factor in the snr - mc interaction rate .",
    "we hypothesize that the snr - mc interaction rate for snrs of varying ages may be solely a function of the `` delay '' between the explosion and interaction .",
    "this supposition is supported by the observation that the incidence of runaway stars is appreciable compared to the overall population of young , nearby stars .",
    "@xcite found that the runaway frequency of ob stars is @xmath375 for their sample .",
    "this population of stars may explode as sne and interact with mcs only as evolved snrs or never exhibit signatures of snr - mc interactions .    assuming massive stars are `` kicked '' or otherwise migrate a large distance from their parent mc , an analysis of the snr - mc interaction rate with snr age would provide a constraint on the delay caused by this migration .",
    "a constant snr - mc interaction rate with age would suggest that there are two distinct populations of massive stars ; those that remain close to their parent mc and those that migrate a large distance such that all known galactic snrs are too young for the latter to have encountered a mc .",
    "the more likely scenario is that the snr - mc interaction rate increases with snr age , which suggests that massive stars migrate a short distance ( i.e. , @xmath376 ) from their parent mc over their lifetimes .",
    "we would expect the snr - mc interaction rate to level off at a certain snr age .",
    "this analysis may provide a constraint on the distribution of massive star runaway velocities and the fraction of massive stars that are runaways .",

    "models of sequential or triggered star formation rely on an understanding of the feedback between massive stars and star forming regions .",
    "while the relationship between ob associations and star - forming regions has long been recognized @xcite , the contribution of shocks from snrs is more ambiguous .",
    "some studies have proposed that these shocks will compress molecular regions and accelerate triggered star formation @xcite , although it is possible the shock velocities involved are dissociative and will destroy the molecular gas instead .",
    "there is also evidence that snrs play little or no role in regulating star formation in individual star clusters due to the time delay before sne occur , but turbulent outflows powered by sne may suppress star formation in giant mcs or even galaxy - wide star formation @xcite .",

    "this problem may be exacerbated by a large fraction of sne that explode far from any molecular gas . over short timescales ,",
    "a large fraction of sne may play no role in galaxy - wide feedback .    in the absence of momentum transfer from snrs , it is possible that stellar feedback mechanisms other than sne are dominant .",
    "for example ,  regions are known to photoionize dense mcs and may suppress star formation where a sufficient level of background radiation is present .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by observations of giant  regions ( such as 30 doradus in the lmc ) indicating that radiation pressure from stars is the dominant mechanism in adding energy and momentum to the surrounding region @xcite .",
    "the relative role of each mechanism must be assessed in the context of specific timescales and physical conditions .",
    "our observations support arguments that snrs may contribute less to stellar feedback than previously thought .",
    "particle acceleration is one of the most important galactic processes in which snrs play a central role .",
    "cosmic rays are produced in snrs where the sn explosion can deliver enough energy to rapidly accelerate nuclear particles @xcite , and the energy density of cosmic rays produced in the shock region increases with the density of the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "enhanced turbulence and magnetic fields can excite significant hadronic particle acceleration which produces @xmath377 mesons that decay immediately into gamma - rays .",

    "<S> we present molecular spectroscopy toward 50 galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) taken at millimeter wavelengths in @xmath0co and @xmath1co @xmath2 with the heinrich hertz submillimeter telescope as part of a systematic survey for broad molecular line ( bml ) regions indicative of interactions with molecular clouds ( mcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations reveal bml regions toward nineteen snrs , including nine newly identified bml regions associated with snrs ( g08.3@xmath30.0 , g09.9@xmath30.8 , g11.2@xmath30.3 , g12.2@xmath40.3 , g18.6@xmath30.2 , g23.6@xmath40.3 , 4c@xmath304.71 , g29.6@xmath40.1 , g32.4@xmath40.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining ten snrs with bml regions confirm previous evidence for mc interaction in most cases ( g16.7@xmath40.1 , kes 75 , 3c 391 , kes 79 , 3c 396 , 3c 397 , w49b , cas a , ic 443 ) , although we confirm that the bml region toward hb 3 is associated with the w3(oh )  region , not the snr . based on the systemic velocity of each mc , molecular line diagnostics , and cloud morphology </S>",
    "<S> , we test whether these detections represent snr - mc interactions . </S>",
    "<S> one of the targets ( g54.1@xmath40.3 ) had previous indications of a bml region , but we did not detect broadened emission toward it . although broadened @xmath0co @xmath2 line emission should be detectable toward virtually all snr - mc interactions we find relatively few examples ; therefore , the number of interactions is low . </S>",
    "<S> this result favors mechanisms other than sn feedback as the basic trigger for star formation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find no significant association between tev gamma - ray sources and mc interactions , contrary to predictions that snr - mc interfaces are the primary venues for cosmic ray acceleration . </S>"
