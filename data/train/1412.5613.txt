    "any method of computational electrostatics could be used to calculate the quantities @xmath209 and @xmath210 that enter eq .",
    "( 8) of the main text ; this includes both analytical techniques such as multipole expansions and numerical methods such as finite - difference or boundary - element approaches .",

    "( 8) of the main text may be evaluated analytically , as in the case of the discs at large separation discussed in the main text .",

    "we pause to note that this dichotomy mirrors the recent evolution of theoretical approaches to electromagnetic fluctuation phenomena ( casimir forces and near - field radiative heat transfer ) , in which geometry - specific multipole bases have been employed to yield rapidly convergent or even analytically tractable series expansions of casimir quantities and heat - transfer rates in high - symmetry geometries  @xcite , while localized basis functions have been used for numerical casimir or heat - transfer calculations in arbitrary geometries  @xcite .      for objects of high symmetry  such as the disc - shaped material bodies considered in the main text ",
    "it is convenient to work in a multipole basis .",
    "for example , in a basis of spherical multipoles one expands scalar fields in solutions of the laplace equation indexed by the usual spherical indices @xmath211 : @xmath212 where @xmath213 are the usual spherical harmonics . in this case ,    * the @xmath210 matrices in eq .",

    "( 8) of the main text describe the multipole sources induced on ( or , equivalently , the outgoing multipole fields emitted by ) material bodies by an incident multipole field .",
    "more specifically , the definition of the spherical - wave @xmath214 matrix elements for a body is as follows : if the body is exposed to an `` incident '' field consisting of a single incoming multipole field , i.e. @xmath215 , then the `` scattered '' field produced by the body is @xmath216 thus , to compute one full column of the @xmath214-matrix we solve a modified electrostatics problem in which the body [ on whose surface we have the @xmath63-dependent boundary condition ( 7 ) ] is exposed to an external @xmath217 field ; after solving the scattering problem we extract @xmath218 as the @xmath219 source multipole induced by this field on the body .",
    "as noted in the main text , the multipole basis becomes unwieldy in the short - distance limit due to the need to retain large numbers of multipoles to obtain sufficient accuracy .",
    "moreover , even at long distances the _ analytical _ usefulness of the multipole basis is restricted to highly symmetric objects for which the @xmath214-matrix elements may be computed in closed form . for shorter distances or less symmetric objects ( such as the squares of figure 2 ) , it is convenient to work with position - space representations of the @xmath214 and @xmath210 operators in eq .",
    "( 8) of the main text .    a direct position - space interpretation of the operator trace in eq .",
    "( 8) of the main text is ill - defined for at least two reasons .",
    "one difficulty is that the operator @xmath210 , whose position - space representation is @xmath220 is singular `` on the diagonal , '' i.e. for @xmath221 this singularity needs somehow to be regularized before the operator products and trace in eq .",
    "( 8) of the main text may be performed .",
    "a second difficulty is that the @xmath209 operators are unwieldy in position space .",

    "<S> we thus arrive at the fundamental conclusion of this letter : the qmi in @xmath0 dimensions is obtained from the _ thermodynamic entropy _ in @xmath1 dimensions as @xmath114 where we dropped the dependence on @xmath3 , but made the dependence on the dimension explicit . </S>",

    "<S> extending the results of this paper to realistic models such as electromagnetism is worthwhile . </S>",
    "<S> the response function can also be generalized to a sum of lorentzians , and thus a general @xmath115 , at the expense of introducing several copies of the matter field for each term in the sum . </S>",
