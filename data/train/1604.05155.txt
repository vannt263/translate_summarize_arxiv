    "given a real number , there are various ways to represent it as an expansion of digits , such as continued fractions ( see khintchine @xcite ) and series expansions ( see galambos @xcite ) including @xmath0-expansions @xcite , lroth expansions @xcite , engel expansions @xcite and alternating engel expansions @xcite and so on .",
    "perhaps the most well - known representation of real numbers is continued fractions . over the last thirty years",
    ", considerable interests are shown in various continued fraction expansions .",
    "examples of such continued fraction expansions include , for example , backward continued fractions @xcite , @xmath1-continued fractions @xcite , oppenheim continued fractions @xcite , multidimensional continued fractions @xcite , @xmath2-continued fractions @xcite and rosen continued fractions @xcite .",
    "most of these continued fraction expansions have invariant and ergodic measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure . by means of the ergodic theory and probability theory ,",
    "some metric and statistical properties of these continued fraction expansions have been well studied when the real number is sampled from the uniform distribution in some interval .",
    "besides , series expansions of real numbers also gave rise to a fruitful study of their ergodic and statistical properties .",
    "the history of this topic may begin with borel , sierpiski , kuzmin , lvy and continue with the seminal work of the hungarian school ( erds , turn , rnyi , szsz , rvsz , galambos ) .",
    "such a theory of using probability theory to answer questions of number theory is called the _ probabilistic number theory _ , see elliott @xcite , rnyi @xcite and tenenbaum @xcite .",
    "essentially these classical studies for continued fractions and series expansions mainly focus on the distribution law , the law of large numbers , the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm for the digit sequence occurring in these expansions . however , it is worth pointing out that these classical limit theorems basically concern that the averages taken over large samples converge to expected values in some sense , but say little or nothing about the rate of convergence .",
    "one way to address this is the theory of large deviations in modern probability theory .",
    "let @xmath3 be a probability space and @xmath4 be a sequence of real - valued random variables defined on @xmath3 .",
    "a function @xmath5 $ ] is called a _ good rate function _ if it is lower semi - continuous and has compact level sets .",
    "we say that the sequence @xmath4 satisfies a _ large deviation principle _",
    "( ldp for short ) with speed @xmath6 and good rate function @xmath7 if for any borel set @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the interior and the closure of @xmath8 respectively .",
    "we use the notation @xmath12 to denote the expectation of a random variable @xmath13 with respect to the probability measure @xmath14 .",
    "grtner - ellis theorem ( see theorem 2.3.6 in @xcite ) tells us that the rate function is often given in term of the legendre transform of the pressure function .",
    "that is , @xmath15 , where the _ pressure function _",
    "@xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 for any @xmath18 when it exists .",
    "for instance , we can study the probability that the empirical mean of a sequence of random variables deviates away from its ergodic mean .",
    "these probabilities are exponentially small in general and follow the large deviation principle .",
    "formally , there is no distinction between the large deviation principle and the moderate deviation principle ( mdp for short ) .",
    "usually ldp characterizes the convergence speed of the law of large numbers , while mdp describes the speed of convergence between the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem . for more details about large and moderate deviations ,",
    "we refer the reader to dembo and zeitouni @xcite , touchette @xcite and varadhan @xcite .",
    "the theory of large deviations plays an important role in the framework of the stochastic processes .",
    "nowadays , it has been developed quite rapidly in different directions and many applications arise , for example , in mathematics , statistics , computer science , physics , and in other fields . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the large and moderate deviation principles for engel continued fractions ( see section 2 ) which is a new type of continued fraction expansion with non - decreasing partial quotients .",
    "recently , such kinds of problems have been considered by zhu @xcite , hu @xcite , fang @xcite , and fang and wu @xcite .",
    "zhu studied the large deviations for engel expansions ( see @xcite ) , whose digit sequence is also non - decreasing .",
    "erds et al .",
    "@xcite proved that the digit sequence of engel expansions forms a time - homogeneous markov chain with explicit transition probability functions .",
    "and they also gave an explicit computation for the distribution of the digit and its asymptotic analysis .",
    "these properties play an important role in zhu s work . however , the engel continued fraction system is not markovian ( see remark [ nmc ] ) . that is where the difficulty is . in @xcite ,",
    "the author studied the large deviations for modified engel continued fractions .",
    "this new continued fraction system is a small modification of engel continued fractions but its partial quotient sequence is strictly increasing . in @xcite ,",
    "the author established the large deviations for alternating engel expansions .",
    "this alternating expansion can be treated as the engel expansion with alternating terms while its digit sequence is strictly increasing .",
    "although these two expansions share the same classical limit theorems ( see @xcite ) , the author also remarked that there is a difference between these expansions in the context of large deviations .",
    "here we remark that the rate functions of the large deviations in @xcite and @xcite are same but different from zhu s .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered two interesting discrete markov processes introduced by williams @xcite , which share the same classical limit theorems but have a difference in the context of large deviations . besides",
    ", the theory of large deviations also has been applied to the analytic number theory , see fray et al .",
    "@xcite , giuliano and macci @xcite , mehrdad and zhu @xcite and radziwill @xcite .",
    "it seems that the large and moderate deviations might have the potential to become the useful tools in studying probabilistic and analytic number theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to stating the large and moderate deviation principles for engel continued fractions . in section 3",
    ", we recall the basic properties of the engel continued fraction expansion and show that the partial quotient sequence of engel continued fractions is not markovian ( see remark [ nmc ] ) but very close to a homogeneous markov chain ( see proposition [ markov chain ] ) , which plays an important role in our proofs .",
    "the proofs of our main results are given in section 4 .",
    "in section 5 , we will see that the theory of large deviations is a more useful tool of dealing with such questions than other tools ( such as , fractal ) in some sense .",
    "in 2002 , hartono et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a new continued fraction algorithm with non - decreasing partial quotients , called the _ engel continued fraction _ ( ecf , for short ) expansion .",
    "the name of this new continued fraction expansion is borrowed from the classical engel expansion ( see erds et al .",
    "now we give the algorithm of this new continued fraction expansion .",
    "let @xmath19 \\longrightarrow ( 0,1]$ ] be the _ ecf map",
    "_ given by @xmath20 } \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{x}-\\left[\\frac{1}{x}\\right]\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] denotes the greatest integer not exceeding @xmath22 .",

    "the representation ( [ ecf ] ) is said to be the _ ecf expansion _ of @xmath22 and @xmath29 are called the _ partial quotients _ of the ecf expansion of @xmath22 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "sometimes we write the form ( [ ecf ] ) as @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "hartono et al .",
    "@xcite studied the arithmetic and ergodic properties of @xmath32 associated to this new continued fraction expansion .",
    "moreover , they showed that @xmath32 is ergodic with respect to lebesgue measure and proved that @xmath32 has no finite invariant measure equivalent to the lebesgue measure , but has infinitely many @xmath33-finite nvariant measures .",
    "this new class of continued fractions can be applied to designing a pseudo random bit generator ( prbg ) and proposing a new scheme for image cryptosystems , see masmoudi et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now we denote @xmath3 by the probability space , where @xmath34 $ ] , @xmath35 is the borel @xmath33-algebra on @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath14 denotes the lebesgue measure on @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "kraaikamp and wu @xcite proved a strong law of large numbers for the partial quotient sequence @xmath37 , i.e. , for @xmath14-almost surely @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath38 this implies that the probability of the event that @xmath39 deviates away from its ergodic mean 1 tends to zero as @xmath6 goes to infinity .",
    "however , it does not give this decay a speed .",
    "this leads to the study of large deviations for the ecf expansion .",
    "[ ldp ] let @xmath37 be the partial quotient sequence of the ecf expansion .",

    "what is interesting though , is that the rate functions of the large deviations for engel continued fractions and engel expansions are similar in structure ( comparing our theorem [ ldp ] with theorem 1.2 of zhu @xcite ) .",
    "we think the main reason is that the digit sequence of modified engel continued fractions or alternating engel expansions is strictly increasing ; while the digit sequence of engel expansions or engel continued fractions is non - decreasing ( see remark [ vs ] for more details ) .",
    "if we consider the large deviations for the sequence @xmath40 with @xmath42 , we will obtain that it also satisfies a ldp with speed @xmath6 and good rate function @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "this indicates that the initial value of @xmath45 will affect the rate function of large deviations for the ecf expansion .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check @xmath46 by ( [ ldp equation ] ) and @xmath47 as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is defied as @xmath50 here we emphasize that @xmath49 is the rate function of large deviations for modified ecf expansions @xcite or alternating engel expansions @xcite or the empirical mean of independent and identically distributed exponential random variables with parameter 1 ( see ( * ? ? ? * exercise 2.2.23 ) and ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite established a central limit theorem for the partial quotient sequence @xmath37 , which tells us by how much the quantity @xmath56 normally exceeds its ergodic mean 1 , namely by an order of @xmath57 .",
    "that is , for every @xmath58 , @xmath59:\\log b_n(x ) - n",

    "now we claim that @xmath272 since @xmath244 for all @xmath68 , by the definitions of @xmath262 and @xmath273 , we easily determine the rate function @xmath241 when @xmath274 and @xmath266 .",
    "it remains to compare @xmath262 with @xmath273 when @xmath275 . to do this ,",
    "define the function @xmath276 then we have that @xmath277 and the derivative of @xmath278 satisfies @xmath279 and @xmath280 if @xmath275 .",

    "in fact , since @xmath282 , we deduce that @xmath287 note that @xmath288 for any @xmath289 , we have @xmath290 for any @xmath283 . combing this with ( [ mdpeq ] ) , we complete the proof .",
    "now we are ready to prove theorem [ mdp ] .",
    "let @xmath63 be the sequence of positive numbers satisfying the conditions in ( [ a - n ] ) .",
    "for any @xmath291 , we consider the logarithmic moment generating function ( see dembo and zeitouni ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.3 ) ) of @xmath292 , @xmath293 from the grtner - ellis theorem , in order to obtaining the desired result , it suffices to show that for any @xmath291 , @xmath294 that is , @xmath295    for any @xmath291 and @xmath28 , let @xmath296 in view of ( [ a - n ] ) , it is clear that @xmath297 as @xmath70 and @xmath298 can be rewritten as @xmath299 being similar to the proof of large deviation principle part , to get ( [ desired result ] ) , we only need to estimate the expectation @xmath300 . since @xmath297 as @xmath70 , there exists a positive number @xmath301 ( only depending on @xmath302 ) such that for all @xmath303 , we have @xmath304 . in the following , we always fix such @xmath6 .",
    "now we will give the lower and upper bounded estimates of @xmath300 respectively .",
    "we first give the lower bound for @xmath300 .",

    "as we know , fractal and large deviations are two main tools of dealing with almost everywhere results .",
    "the former is concerned with the fractal structure ( such as , hausdorff dimension ) of the set of points for which the desired almost everywhere result does not hold or attains any other values ; while the latter considers the speeds of probabilities of the events that the desired almost everywhere result deviates away from its ergodic mean .",
    "they are the two different aspects of describing the same thing .",
    "what is interesting is that these two different ways have some relations in some special cases ( see denker and kessebhmer @xcite , fang et al .",
    "@xcite , pesin and weiss @xcite ) .",
    "engel continued fractions and modified engel continued fractions ( see @xcite ) are two typical examples of oppenheim continued fractions introduced by fan et al .",
    "@xcite in 2007 . and",
    "modified engel continued fractions is just a small modification of engel continued fractions .",
    "fan et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that these two continued fractions share the classical limit theorems , such as the law of large numbers , the central limit theorem , the law of the iterated logarithm , and other statical laws . from the fractal points of view",
    ", we can obtain that for any @xmath329 , the set @xmath330:\\lim_{n",

    "however , comparing the theorem 1.1 of @xcite with our theorem [ ldp ] in section 2 , we know that ecf expansions and modified ecf expansions have a difference in the context of large deviations . from this point of view , large deviation is a more useful tool than other tools in such questions .",
