    "<S> perturbing objects or _ impurities _ can be controllably introduced by transferring a fraction of atoms into a different hyperfine state @xcite , or by admixing a different atomic species @xcite . as we show , such impurities immersed in an _ interacting _ cold atom environment is a particularly appealing setup . </S>",
    "<S> it gives rise to a long - range interaction , which we hereafter denote as the _ casimir _ interaction , due to scattering of virtual phonons , the same mechanism lying at the heart of the analogous photon - induced casimir effect . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the cold - atom analog of the interaction has the advantage of being continuously tunable both in magnitude and in _ sign _ , a task which is hardly achievable in a linear electromagnetic medium @xcite .    in most studies of casimir interactions </S>",

    "<S> conclusions ( a ) & ( b ) were reached by appealing to the scaling theory of the effective impurity strength @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter shows a non - trivial energy dependence in the presence of a quantum liquid due to its non - linear ( _ i.e. , _ interacting ) nature . </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind this is that , in addition to direct scattering off the impurity , excitations of the liquid may also scatter indirectly off the local density distortion induced by the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism gives rise to a renormalization of the low - energy effective impurity strength : for a system of repulsively interacting fermions the impurity is renormalized into a perfectly reflecting barrier @xcite , while for bosons the impurity instead becomes perfectly transparent ( hence ( b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> however the casimir effect comes _ not _ from the ultimate low - energy impurity strength , but rather relies on the participation of an _ energy band _ of quantum fluctuations , whose width is set by @xmath15 . as a result , there is a long - range casimir force even in the case where the impurity strength renormalizes towards zero . </S>",
    "<S> moreover such a flow towards zero impurity strength is a universal feature of mobile impurities in any environment , both bosonic and fermonic . </S>",

    "<S> the analysis utilized above also follows through entirely for _ static _ impurities in 1d interacting _ bosonic _ ( or attractively interacting fermionic ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> this offers possibly the most straightforward way to verify the @xmath0 law ( although in this case , to authors knowledge , one does not have a possibility of tuning through integrability , as in the case of mobile impurities ) . to this end </S>",
    "<S> one would pin two impurites with the help of a state - dependent optical lattice @xcite or a species selective dipole potential @xcite , and perform rf spectroscopy on individual impurity atoms @xcite . as a function of their separation , one can then measure the corresponding line shifts of suitable internal hyperfine energy levels .    to estimate the magnitude of the casimir effect we focus on the strongly - interacting tonks limit where the energy scale @xmath94 is largest . for the experiment of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one finds a density of @xmath95rb atoms @xmath96 with a typical interaction strength of @xmath97 . with temperatures </S>",
    "<S> as low as @xmath98 and a speed of sound @xmath99 this leads to @xmath100 and @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the magnitude of the potential at the closest applicable separation @xmath102 is @xmath103 , while for @xmath104 one finds @xmath105 , indicating 3 orders of magnitude variation over a @xmath106 range of separations . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the effect @xmath107 is thus within an experimentally accessible range , with the scale of applicable separations increasing as one goes deeper into the quantum degenerate regime , @xmath49 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that mobile impurities immersed in a 1d quantum liquid are subject to a long - range casimir interaction , universally given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : potential ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this happens in spite of the fact that they become transparent at low energies . for several integrable impurity models , the amplitude of impurity - phonon scattering vanishes , leading to the absence of casimir interactions in those systems . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the strength of the effect is estimated to be within the resolution of current cold atom experiments , opening the possibility of observing the casimir effect in a highly tunable , non - linear environment .    </S>",
