    "to understand cosmology , it is necessary to work with equations that come from general relativity .",
    "that does not mean a student needs a course in general relativity to get started .",
    "substantial working knowledge of cosmology can be built on simple undergraduate physics .",
    "the friedmann equation is the key .",
    "it is one of the two einstein equations of general relativity that govern the expansion of the universe .",
    "the other can be easily understood ; it accounts for work done by pressure as the universe expands .",
    "the friedmann equation can be derived for a newtonian universe where motion is nonrelativistic and gravity is attraction between @xmath1 in this case , the friedmann equation describes conservation of nonrelativistic kinetic energy plus gravitational potential energy for the motion of a galaxy in the expansion . to move to relativity we use the equivalence of mass and energy and change mass density to energy density .",
    "what we need to know about general relativity at this step is that it gives exactly the same friedmann equation in all cases .",
    "the foundation is curvature of space rather than gravitational energy , but the result is the same .",
    "there are no correction terms .",
    "the only change we have to make is to interpret the density in the friedmann equation as that of energy rather than mass and include all forms of energy in it .    that is reviewed and developed here .",
    "descriptions and explanations of radiation pressure and vacuum pressure are added to complete a basic kit of cosmology tools .",
    "it fills in the mathematics left out of descriptive reviews @xmath2 and provides a basis for teaching cosmology to undergraduates in a way that quickly equips them to do basic calculations .",
    "application of the equations is demonstrated here with calculations that : determine characteristics of the expansion for cases where the energy density is dominated by radiation , matter , or vacuum ; present and answer the question how the energy density got so close to the critical density ; find how much vacuum energy compared to matter energy is needed to make the expansion accelerate ; and find how little is needed to make it stop .    the travel time and luminosity distance for light from a distant source",
    "are calculated in terms of the redshift and the densities of matter and vacuum energy . in the scaled friedmann equation that is used for this , the constant in the curvature term",
    "is determined by matching with the present values of the hubble parameter and energy density and is found to be a function of them .",
    "general relativity is not needed for that , but it is needed to describe how the curvature of space can change the area of the sphere of light and , thereby , the intensity of the light spread over that sphere , and hence the luminosity distance used in hubble plots . in particular , general relativity gives the curvature in terms of the energy density .",
    "thirty - one problems , most of them easy , explore some of these topics in more detail and extend the range of application .",
    "two basic equations of cosmology govern the expansion of the universe .",
    "they can be understood as statements about energy .",
    "one says there is a constant like the sum of kinetic and gravitational energy for the motion of a galaxy in the expansion .",
    "the other equation accounts for the work done by pressure as the universe expands .",
    "the expansion of the universe is observed as motion of galaxies away from each other .",
    "the universe is like an expanding gas , but the units are galaxies ; an individual galaxy does not expand .",
    "the hubble law describes what is @xmath3 the speeds of galaxies moving away from us are proportional to their distances from us .",
    "galaxies at distances @xmath4 are moving away from us with average speed @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hubble parameter . the hubble law is what we expect to observe in a spatially isotropic uniformly expanding @xmath7 we assume it would be the same for observers at any other location .",
    "we assume the universe is in fact homogeneous , the same everywhere , at any given time . right now",
    ", that can be true only at scales larger than clusters of galaxies , but the isotropy of the cosmic radiation is evidence that at earlier times the universe was in fact very @xmath8 gravity pulls the galaxies together and slows the expansion of the universe .",
    "if distances are measured from a typical galaxy , which could be at any location , the force of gravity on a galaxy at distance @xmath4 coming from the mass of homogeneous universe inside the sphere of radius @xmath4 is the same as if all that mass were at the center of the sphere .",
    "there is no force of gravity from the spherical shells of homogeneous universe outside that sphere .",
    "the kinetic plus gravitational potential energy for the motion of a galaxy of mass @xmath9 in the expansion is therefore @xmath10 where @xmath11 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath12 is the mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the density of mass in the universe . using the hubble law , eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) , we get @xmath15 at a given time in our homogeneous universe , @xmath6 and @xmath14 are constant throughout space .",
    "that means @xmath16 is the same for all galaxies .",
    "in particular , the negative , zero , or positive character of @xmath17 is the same for all galaxies .    if @xmath17 is not zero , we can choose units and find a time @xmath18 so that @xmath19 is 1",
    ". then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is 1 , 0 or -1 depending on whether @xmath17 is negative , zero , or positive .",
    "the constant @xmath22 is the magnitude of @xmath23 .",
    "it stays constant while @xmath24 change in time .",
    "( this constant will be handled in a completely different way in sections ix and x where applications require its use .",
    "meanwhile we will see how much can be done without knowing anything more about it . )",
    "now we invoke @xmath25 and let @xmath14 be the energy density of the universe .",
    "we use units for which @xmath26 is 1 .",
    "mass and energy are equivalent .",
    "we assume , as in general relativity , that all energy creates gravity . with @xmath14 the energy density , our eq .",
    "( 2.5 ) is the friedmann equation obtained from general relativity , where @xmath27 is the constant 1 , 0 , or -1 that indicates whether the curvature of space is positive , zero , or @xmath28    in our newtonian equations , @xmath17 is constant , so @xmath27 is constant .",
    "we have derived the friedmann equation for the case of a newtonian universe .",
    "general relativity says the friedmann equation holds with constant @xmath29 in all cases .",
    "of course general relativity provides a derivation of the friedmann equation that is altogether more satisfactory .",
    "but newtonian physics comes remarkably close .",
    "it gives us an equation that is exactly the friedmann equation where newtonian physics applies and with reinterpretation becomes exactly the friedmann equation in all cases .",
    "it does not require correction terms .",
    "the friedmann equation is one of the two einstein equations of general relativity for the homogeneous universe .",
    "the other just adds that as a volume @xmath30 of the universe expands by an amount @xmath31 , the pressure @xmath32 in the volume does work @xmath33 which decreases the energy in the volume by that amount .",
    "so for a sphere of radius @xmath4 , @xmath34 which implies that @xmath35 we can write the friedmann eq . ( 2.5 ) as @xmath36 taking the time derivative of this , using eq . ( 3.2 ) for @xmath37 , yields @xmath38 these last two eqs .",
    "( 3.3 ) and ( 3.4 ) are the two basic equations of cosmology obtained from general @xmath39",
    "the pressure depends on the nature of energy .",
    "the energy density can come from matter , radiation , vacuum , or combinations of these .",
    "each gives a different pressure .",
    "the energy density of matter does not produce pressure that affects the expansion of the universe .",
    "galaxies are not colliding and creating pressure the way molecules in a gas do . in the early universe ,",
    "the energy density was mostly from radiation .",
    "the density and pressure of radiation are related by @xmath40 that is shown in appendix a.    the work done by each constituent decreases the energy of that constituent as the universe expands , so eq . ( 3.1 ) holds separately for each constituent : @xmath41 where @xmath42 for matter , radiation , or vacuum . for matter , @xmath43 is zero , so @xmath44 the energy in a sphere of matter does not change as the sphere expands ; it just spreads out .",

    "it all fits together .",
    "the energy density of vacuum does not change : @xmath68 that means @xmath69 so eq . ( 4.2 ) implies @xmath70    there are layers of understanding this .",
    "superficially we can say the energy density of vacuum does not change because there is nothing there to change . to probe more deeply",
    ", we remember that the vacuum is supposed to be lorentz invariant . in a homogeneous universe ,",
    "the energy density is constant throughout space .",
    "the spatial gradient of the energy density is zero .",
    "lorentz transformations mix space and time derivatives , so for lorentz invariance the time derivative of the energy density must be zero too .",
    "we can explore this further by considering the energy - momentum tensor .",
