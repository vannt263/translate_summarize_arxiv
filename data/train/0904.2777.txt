    "the spitzer images provide near unobscured light profiles , even for our edge - on galaxies .",
    "we scale the rgb surface density star counts such that they match the ir luminosity profiles in the overlapping region . in this way",

    "we find that all galaxies show extended components beyond the inner exponential disk component .",
    "for the small and more face - on galaxies in the sample the size and shape of the extended component is somewhat unclear due to the uncertain contribution of contamination ( unresolved background galaxies , image defects , etc . ) limiting the range where the outer profile can be determined for these galaxies .",
    "several of the most massive galaxies have very extended envelopes with stellar densities at 30 kpc that are 10100 times higher than the contamination background , with equivalent surface brightnesses of about 29 @xmath9-mag arcsec@xmath10 at these radii .",

    ". the exponential thin disks only dominate the inner @xmath323 kpc ( 5 - 10 scale heights ) , while the extended components are evident at larger radii .",

    "is the evidence for an extended component less certain .",
    "we measure a pure exponential disk for this galaxy to at least 20 kpc ( more than 10 disk - scale lengths ) , but a field at 40kpc deviates strongly from the exponential trend .",
    "however the stellar density of this outer field is close to the sky background contamination .",
    "furthermore , ngc5236/m83 has at least two stellar streams at larger radii , indicating the presence of significant substructure in the halo .      in this section",
    "we explore the connection between bulges and the extended components .",
    "we fit two component 2d models to the inner 4.5 micron surface brightness and outer star count data .",
    "the first component consists of a projected disk with an exponential radial profile and a @xmath12 vertical profile @xcite .",
    "the second component is a flattened halo with a srsic radial density profile and a minor - over - major axis ratio of @xmath5 .",
    "merger models show that the hot components resulting after a violent relaxation generally exhibit a srsic profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",

    "this simple model obviously does not capture the fluctuations due to spiral arms , nor can it describe the boxy ( pseudo-)bulge in edge - on galaxies ngc891 and ngc4565 ( but does describe the central overdensity inside this boxy pseudo - bulge ) .",
    "the fitted models are also unable to capture the halo substructure seen as asymmetries and profile irregularities as described in the next section .",
    "the fitted halos are highly flattened , with typical @xmath5 values of 0.4 for the edge - on galaxies .",
    "the smaller galaxies in the sample ( @xmath0@xmath6100150 kms@xmath14 ) have small extended components , barely discernible above the background contamination ( see fig.[profs ] ) .",
    "the shape of the extended component is thus poorly constrained due to both the uncertainty in the background and low number statistics .",
    "furthermore , the central bulge region provides no extra constraint as these galaxies have no bulge , or at most contain a central star cluster .",
    "the star counts can be fitted equally well by exponential , power law , and srsic law profiles .",
    "this extended feature could be the thick disk , as observations along the ngc4244 major axis suggest the component is very flattened .",
    "however , the disk as traced by rgb stars , whose scale height is twice that of the main sequence population , has already been identified as the thick disk @xcite , hence the feature observed here is likely an additional component .",
    "these additional components are most likely ( depending on exact shape ) more luminous than predicted in the hierarchical models of @xcite , but could have been created by the bombardment of small dark matter sub - halos @xcite .      comparing the envelopes of the different galaxies we find that the two small galaxies have much smaller extended components than the larger galaxies , with surface densities that are lower relative to their disks .",
    "the more massive galaxies in our sample are very similar in terms of mass , luminosity , and scale size .",
    "still , there is significant variation in outer envelope properties . at 20 kpc ngc891 ,",
    "ngc4565 , and ngc7814 have power law profiles with a slope of about -2.5 .",
    "ngc3031/m81 has a steeper profile , while at 20 kpc ngc5236 is still dominated by the ( face - on ) disk . at first sight , the envelope luminosity at 20 kpc seems correlated with hubble type and bulge - to - disk ratio , with the bulge dominated ngc7814 being the brightest and the late - type spiral ngc5236 showing only an uncertain hint of an envelope beyond 30kpc . whilst m31 also fits this trend , the sab galaxy ngc3031/m81 does not , as a steeper and fainter profile is evident at 20 kpc on one side of the galaxy . then again",
    ", the higher counts in another field at 20kpc , albeit on the other side of m81 , is consistent with the general trend .",
    "this observed asymmetry may be due to the multiple interactions m81 is undergoing or due to halo substructure .    in fig.[profs",
    "] we also show a typical profile from the @xcite model of accreted stars .",
    "our profiles are somewhat shallower and mostly fainter than these models between 10 and 30 kpc .",
    "while the surface density normalization may be somewhat uncertain in the models , the shape is quite well constrained .",
    "it could be that the true halos only dominate at even larger radii and the slope becomes even shallower at larger radii .",
    "however , in hierarchical galaxy formation the halo and `` classical '' bulge are formed by the same merging process , so there is no reason to suspect a large structural change between bulge and halo .",
    "the srsic radii derived for our combined envelope and bulge fits are typically eight times smaller than those of @xcite . however , a number of simulation parameters affect the concentration of the accreted halos .",
    "suppresing star formation earlier , e.g. by pushing the epoch of reionization to higher redshift , ensures that only the most massive dark matter sub - halos contain stars , which yields steeper and fainter envelopes @xcite .",
    "alternatively , if the stars in the accreted satellites sit deeper in the potential wells of their dark matter sub - halos , they will then be tidally stripped closer to the main galaxy , also resulting in more concentrated halos @xcite .",
    "we use delaunay tessellations to reconstruct the surface density distributions in our fields ( sick & de jong , in prep . ) .",
    "many galaxies show indications of halo substructure , even with our sparse sampling technique . in m83",
    "we clearly detect a known stream that is dominated by old stars and has a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath3 - 0.6 ( seth & de jong , in prep . ) . for both m81 and m83",
    "we find significantly different surface densities on opposite sides of the galaxies at the same distance from the center .",
    "many galaxies show deviations from smooth radial profiles , most notably ngc891 , where our outer minor axis field is much higher than expected based on an extrapolation of the inner halo profile .",
    "ngc4631 has an obvious over - density associated with the neighboring galaxy ngc4627 just to the north , but there is also a clear over - density to the northwest .",
    "this over - density , that is seen in main sequence , agb , and rgb stars , is potentially associated with an  stream in this strongly interacting system .    in stark contrast to these clear signs of substructure",
    ", we find no signs of any substructure surrounding the disk of ngc4565 .",
    "when comparing these density reconstructions with the substructure observed around m31 on the same physical scale , the ngc4565 halo appears to be much smoother .",
    "we are currently developing techniques to quantify halo substructure .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the metallicities of the stellar envelopes can be derived from the colors of the rgb stars , albeit with some degeneracy with population age .",
    "we have used this technique to derive the radial metallicity distribution for the ghosts galaxies assuming a typical population age of 10gyr ( fig.[radmet ] ) .",
    "using younger isochrones would increases the metallicity and correcting for the agb contamination in the rgb area will also increase the metallicity .",
    "the more massive galaxies",
    "( ngc891 , ngc3031 , ngc4565 , ngc7814 ) have significantly higher metallicities than the lower mass galaxies ( ic5052 , ngc4244 , ngc7793 ) as has been seen before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even though we detect halo metallicity gradients for the massive galaxies , the metallicities at 30 kpc are still much higher than found for the kinematically selected milky way halo .",
    "we speculate that our flattened inner halos are the results of more self - enriched , massive accreted satellites , while the hotter , more metal poor halos may be detected at larger radii and are the result of earlier , less enriched , smaller satellite accretion .",
