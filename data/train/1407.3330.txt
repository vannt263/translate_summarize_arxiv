    "cosmological weak lensing is one of the most powerful cosmological probes , as it allows us to directly map out the distribution of matter in the universe without assumptions about galaxy biases ( see heymans  2013 ; more  2014 for the recent results ) .",
    "upcoming galaxy surveys such as the subaru hyper suprime - cam survey ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* takada 2010 ) ) aim to use the high - precision weak lensing measurements to tackle questions on fundamental physics including the origin of cosmic acceleration and neutrino masses .",
    "most of the useful weak lensing signals are in the nonlinear clustering regime , over a range of multipoles around @xmath0a few thousands . due to the mode - coupling nature of nonlinear structure formation , the weak lensing field at the scales of interest display prominent non - gaussian features .",
    "thus the two - point correlation function or the fourier - transformed counterpart , the power spectrum , no longer fully describes the statistical properties of the weak lensing field .",
    "which statistical quantities or their combination can be optimal to extract a maximum information of the weak lensing field is still an open question and needs to be carefully explored in order to attain the full potential of the weak lensing surveys .",
    "although weak lensing cosmology involves various statistical issues such as an accurate measurement of galaxy shapes , astronomical data reduction , and parameter estimation , in this paper we focus on the above statistical question .",
    "the weak lensing convergence field is expressed as a weighted projection of the three - dimensional mass density fluctuation field along the line of sight . for a source galaxy at the radial distance @xmath1 and in the angular direction @xmath2 , the convergence field",
    "is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass density fluctuation field along the line of sight and we assumed a flat geometry universe .",
    "although the weak lensing is observationaly estimated from the ellipticities of source galaxy shapes , the so - called weak lensing shear field , the shear field is equivalent to the convergence field in the weak lensing regime , so we throughout this paper work on the convergence field . as obvious from the above equation ,",
    "the statistical properties of the weak lensing field reflect those of the underlying mass density .",
    "if the mass density field is a gaussian random field , which is the case in the linear regime , the weak lensing field is also gaussian .",
    "if the mass field is non - gaussian , which is the case in the nonlinear regime , the weak lensing should inevitably display non - gaussian features .",
    "the weak lensing field is measurable only in a statistical way .",
    "the most conventional method used in the literature is the two - point correlation function .",
    "using the limber s approximation and the flat - sky approximation , the fourier - transformed counterpart , the power spectrum is given as @xmath5 where we defined the lensing efficiency function @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the mass power spectrum at redshift @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , the lensing bispectrum , which is the lowest - order correlation function to measure the non - gaussianity , is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the mass bispectrum , and a set of the three wavevectors satisfies the triangle condition in fourier space : e.g. , @xmath12 . while the power spectrum is a one - dimensional function of the wavelength @xmath13 , the bispectrum is given as a function of triangle configurations .",
    "likewise the @xmath14-point correlation function of the weak lensing field arises from the @xmath14-point function of the mass density field .",
    "the weak lensing correlation functions are sensitive to both the geometry of the universe and the growth of matter clustering via the lensing efficiency function and the mass correlation functions . with these dependences weak lensing cosmology",
    "is expected to be one of the most powerful probes for constraining cosmological parameters as well as testing theory of gravity on cosmological scales ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* takada & jain 2004 ; oguri & takada 2011 ) ) .",
    "in order to realize the constraining power of the weak lensing correlation functions for a given survey , we need to quantify statistical uncertainties in the measured correlation functions .",
    "the important source of the statistical uncertainties is the _ sample variance _ arising due to a finite number of fourier modes sampled from a finite survey volume .",
    "recently we developed a simple , unified approach to describing the impact of super - sample covariance , which arises from modes that are larger than or comparable with the survey size , on the correlation functions .",
    "the method is written in a general form and can be applied to any large - scale structure probe . in this section",
    "we briefly review the theory following @xcite ( also see hamilton et al .",
    "2006 for the pioneer work ) .",
    "since the statistical properties of the weak lensing field reflect those of the mass density field as we discussed above , we here consider the power spectrum of the three - dimensional mass density field . for a finite volume survey , the observed field",
    "is generally expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a survey window function ; @xmath17 if @xmath18 is in the survey region , otherwise @xmath19 . for a finite - area weak lensing survey",
    ", one can think of the windowed mass density field as the mass density field in the finite volume around a certain lens redshift and confined with the survey area .",
    "the fourier - transformed density field is given as @xmath20 .",
    "through the window function that has support for @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the typical size of the survey , we can properly take into account the effects of super - survey modes that are comparable with or larger than the survey size .",
    "then we can define the power spectrum estimator as @xmath23 where the integral is over a shell in @xmath24-space of width @xmath25 , volume @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and the effective survey volume is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "the ensemble average of its estimator is a convolution of the underlying power spectrum with the window @xmath29 thus for @xmath30 this estimator is biased low compared to the true power spectrum due to transfer of power into the fluctuation in the spatially - averaged density of the survey volume . for @xmath31",
    "this bias becomes progressively smaller since the underlying power spectrum is expected to be smooth across @xmath32 .",
    "the covariance matrix describes statistical uncertainties in the power spectrum estimation , defined as @xmath33&= & { \\left\\langle \\hat{p}_\\delta(k_i)\\hat{p}_\\delta(k_j)\\right\\rangle } -{\\left\\langle \\hat{p}_\\delta(k_i)\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle \\hat{p}_\\delta(k_j)\\right\\rangle}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq&c^g_{ij}+\\frac{1}{v_w}\\bar{t}_w(k_i , j_j ) .",

    "the prefactor `` @xmath40 '' in @xmath41 arises from the fact that the density field is real , yielding @xmath42 , and therefore the modes of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not independent .",
    "the gaussian piece has only the diagonal components , ensuring that the power spectra of different bins are uncorrelated with each other .",
    "the second term , proportional to @xmath45 , is the non - gaussian contribution arising from the connected 4-point function or trispectrum , convolved with the survey window function : @xmath46\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times ( 2\\pi)^3\\delta_d^3({{\\bf q}}_{1234 } ) t_\\delta({{\\bf k}}+{{\\bf q}}_1,-{{\\bf k}}+{{\\bf q}}_2,{{\\bf k}}'+{{\\bf q}}_3,-{{\\bf k}}'+{{\\bf q}}_4),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the mass trispectrum and the notation @xmath48 .",
    "the convolution with the window function means that different 4-point configurations separated by less than the fourier width of the window function contribute to the covariance .",
    "we call this aspect of the covariance the super sample covariance ( ssc ) effect .",
    "the trispectrum consistency introduced in @xcite asserts that the ssc term in the trispectrum must be consistent with the response of the power spectrum to change in the background density : @xmath49 where the mode of @xmath50 is a super - survey mode satisfying @xmath51 , and the overbar refers to an angle average over the direction of @xmath50 .",
    "the background density @xmath52 is the average density fluctuation in the survey region . here",
    "@xmath53 is is the linear power spectrum and is designated that for this relation to be applicable @xmath52 must be a mode in the linear regime , i.e. the survey scale must be much larger than the nonlinear scale . with this consistency prescription ,",
    "the power spectrum covariance is simplified as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the variance of the background density in the survey window , defined as @xmath56 is the standard non - gaussian term arising from the mass trispectrum of sub - survey modes : @xmath57 .",
    "the linear variance @xmath58 can be easily computed for any survey geometry , either by evaluating the above equation directly , or using gaussian realizations of the linear density field .",
    "the ssc term scales with the survey volume only through @xmath55 whereas the other terms scale like white noise @xmath59 .",
    "thus , even if the initial density field is gaussian , the nonlinear structure formation induces non - gaussian contributions to the sample variance . in other words ,",
    "the non - gaussian sample variance depends on the nature of large - scale structure formation that governs how the different fourier modes are correlated with each other via nonlinear gravity .    , computed using the separate universe approach .",
    "in addition to the fiducial run with @xmath60 , we ran 64 separate universe pairs with @xmath61 , where we used the same initial seeds to reduce the stochasticity ( each simulation has a box size of 500  @xmath62mpc and @xmath63 particles ) .",
    "there are two distinct effects of the super - box mode ( here treated as a dc mode ) : the growth effect and the dilation effect ( see text for details ) .",
    "the curve labeled by `` total '' is a sum of these two effects , leaving characteristic scale dependence in the response .",
    "the bold curve is the average of the 64 pairs , and the thin curve is the result for each pair .",

    ", width=336 ]    to compute the power spectrum response for a given cosmological model , we can use the _ separate universe approach _ developed in @xcite . in this approach",
    "the impact of the super - box mode @xmath52 is absorbed into changes in the background cosmological parameters in a finite - volume simulation with periodic boundary condition : @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the linear growth rate and we have introduced the notations such as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 denotes the parameter in a separate universe ( a finite volume region at the fixed @xmath52 ) . our convention is to set the scale factor of the separate universe @xmath68 to agree with the global one at high redshift : @xmath69 . since the linear background density @xmath52 evolves with @xmath65 ,",
    "so @xmath70 ; the relations about cosmological parameters hold independently of the redshift at which @xmath52 and @xmath65 are defined .",
    "thus , even if the global universe has a flat geometry , @xmath71 , the separate universe with non - zero @xmath52 is realized as a non - zero curvature universe , @xmath72 . because this is the curvature effect , time evolution of all the sub - box fourier modes is affected by the super - box mode , due to the modified expansion history .",
    "[ fig : dpdd_scatter ] shows the power spectrum response computed using the separate universe approach .",
    "there are two distinct contributions to the power spectrum response .",
    "first , the presence of super - survey mode modifies the growth of sub - volume modes via the mode coupling in nonlinear structure formation .",
    "if the survey region is embedded in a coherently overdense region , i.e. @xmath73 , the growth of sub - volume modes is enhanced .",
    "we call this effect `` growth '' .",
    "second , the super - survey mode causes remapping of physical and comoving length scales .",
    "an overdense region expands less quickly than in the global universe .",
    "we call this effect `` dilation '' as it changes the comoving scale corresponding to features in the power spectrum .",
    "the figure shows that , in the total , these two effects partially cancel , leaving a characteristic scale - dependence in the response .",
    "we also note that , if we use the halo model to estimate the power spectrum response by directly computing the windowed trispectrum , @xmath45 , the analytical prediction gives about 10%-level agreement with the separate universe result over the range of @xmath24 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dpdd_scatter ] .    , relative to the gaussian term @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",
    "the result denoted as `` sub '' is the covariance estimated from subvolumes of 7 large - volume simulations ; each of the simulations has a @xmath76 box size and is divided into @xmath77 subvolumes of size 500  @xmath78 each ( 3584 subvolumes in total ) .",
    "thus each subvolume includes the super - box mode effects .",
    "the result `` small '' is the covariance estimated from small - box simulations of 500  @xmath78 each , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the result `` small+ssc '' shows the covariance computed by adding the ssc effect , calibrated based on the separate universe approach in the previous figure , to the small - bx variance .",
    "the `` small+ssc '' result is in nice agreement with the `` sub '' result to within the bootstrap errors .",
    "note that bootstrap errors between bins are highly correlated .",
    "this plot is taken from li  ( 2014 ) . ]",
    "upcoming wide - area galaxy surveys require an accurate estimation of the power spectrum covariance or more generally the covariance of any large - scale structure probes .",

    "( [ eq : pscov ] ) , we can propose a way of calibrating the power spectrum covariance at computationally reasonable expense . to compute the standard part , the gaussian piece and the trispectrum piece of sub - volume modes , we can use mock catalogs of a galaxy survey , based on n - body simulations of small boxes . to compute the ssc effect , we can use the separate universe simulations for the fiducial cosmology . in doing this , we can properly take into account the survey window to compute the linear variance , @xmath55 .",
    "this method does not require huge - volume simulations whose size is designed to be well larger than the size of survey volume in order to include the super - survey effects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : variance ] , we indeed show that the above method combining the small - box simulations and the separate universe simulations well reproduces the covariance matrix from the large - volume simulations .",
    "the figure also shows that the ssc effect boosts the covariance amplitude by up to an order of magnitude over the range of wavenumbers we consider .",

    "again this is equivalent to about 60% larger survey area for the power spectrum tomography alone . in this case",
    "we considered 6525 triangle configurations , and we take into account the non - gaussian correlations between the different spectra including the hsv effects .",
    "can we recover the initial gaussian field from observables of the present - day large - scale structure ? this is an unresolved , open question . in this paper",
    "we discussed the example of the weak lensing field that is the line - of - sight projection of the three - dimensional mass density field in large - scale structure .",
    "we showed that the information content inherent in the power spectrum , which is the two - point correlation function in fourier space , is smaller than the gaussian information by more than a factor of 2 at @xmath124 .",
    "we showed that the bispectrum , which is the three - point correlation function , does add the information to the power spectrum , but the combined information does not fully recover the gaussian information  still only 50% of the gaussian information at @xmath125 . in order to derive this conclusion",
    ", we included all the two- and three - point level information in a sense that we included the bispectra of all available triangle configurations for a given range of multipoles as well as properly took into account the auto- and cross - covariances between the two- and three - point correlation functions .",
    "this implies that the higher - order correlation functions are further needed to recover the gaussian information . or our result implies a limitation of the information recovery ; some of the initial memory is lost due to the strong mode coupling in the deeply nonlinear regime .",
    "alternatively , the nonlinear mapping of the cosmological field , such as the log - normal mapping ( seo  2012 ) , might be a more practically useful way .",
    "however , this conclusion is a bit misleading .",
    "most of the information loss is caused mainly by the super - sample covariance .",
    "as we showed , the super - survey effects are parameterized mainly by the average density fluctuation in the survey volume , @xmath52 , on each realization basis . hence , by treating @xmath52 as an additional parameter together with cosmological parameters , we may be able to calibrate most of the super - sample variance effects in the correlation measurements ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "we can even treat the super - survey mode as `` signal '' and then estimate its value for a given survey volume by fitting the measurements with the model .",
    "this is an interesting possibility , and needs to be further explored .",

    "<S> in particular we show that super - survey modes whose length scale is larger than or comparable with the survey size cause significant sample variance in the weak lensing correlations via the mode - coupling with sub - survey modes due to nonlinear gravitational clustering  the so - called _ super - sample variance_. in this paper we discuss the origin of the super - sample variance and then study the information content inherent in the weak lensing correlation functions up to three - point level . </S>"
