    "binary pulsars are considered to have strong surface magnetic fields in the range of @xmath2gauss .",
    "their field strengths can be directly measured through energies of cyclotron resonance scattering features ( crsfs ) , which often appear in their x - ray spectra ( e.g mihara 1995 ; makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) . neglecting the gravitational redshift , the magnetic field strength @xmath3",
    "is then calculated from the resonance energy @xmath4 through a relation of @xmath5 .",
    "since the magnetic field must be intrinsic to a pulsar , the crsf energy was believed to be constant in each object . however , a @xmath635 % change in the cyclotron energy was unexpectedly observed with _",
    "ginga _ from the recurrent transient pulsar 4u0115 + 63 , between its 1990 and 1991 outbursts ( mihara 1995 ; mihara et al .  1998 , 2004 ) .",
    "the change is considered to reflect luminosity - dependent variations in the accretion - column height by several hundred meters , assuming a dipolar field configuration ( mihara et al .",
    "the effect was studied in further detail by nakajima et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , using the _ rxte _ data of 4u0115 + 63 which continuously covered another outburst in 1999 . at that time",
    ", the crsf energy was confirmed to increase from @xmath611 kev to @xmath616 kev , as the 350 kev source luminosity ( at an assumed distance of 7 kpc ; negueruela & okazaki 2001 ) decreased across a relatively narrow range of @xmath7 ergs s@xmath1 .    from another source , x0331 + 53 ( v0332 + 53 ) ,",
    "a similar effect was detected with _ integral _ ( mowlavi et al .",
    "2006 ) and _ rxte _ ( nakajima 2006b ) .",
    "the change in the crsf energy , however , started in this case at a higher luminosity of @xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 , assuming this object to have a distance of 7 kpc as well ( negueruela et al .",
    "thus , the luminosity - dependent change in the crsf energy is emerging as a new intriguing issue , of which a unified view is yet to be constructed .",
    "this _ letter _ deals with a0535 + 262 , yet another recurrent transient with a 103 sec pulsation period and a 111 day orbital period , located at a distance of 2.0 kpc ( steele et al .",
    "its crsfs were discovered at 50 and 100 kev by the ttm and hexe instruments onborad _ mir - kvant _ in a 1989 outburst ( kendziorra et al .  1994 ) , and the 2nd harmonic was later reconfirmed at 110 kev with the _ cgro _ osse ( grove et al .",
    "since this pulsar has the _ highest _ measured crsf energy , it is of particular interest to compare this object with 4u  0115 + 53 , which has the _ lowest _ known crsf energy . however , the previous crsf measurements from a0535 + 262 were all limited to very luminous states . here",
    ", we report on a successful detection of the crsf from this source by _ suzaku _ , made for the first time at a very low luminosity of @xmath9 ergs s@xmath1 ( inoue et al .",
    "according to _ rxte _ asm monitoring , a0535 + 262 entered outburst twice in 2005 . on the first occasion , the 210 kev intensity reached a peak of 1.3 crab ( @xmath10 ergs s@xmath1 in luminosity ) on june 6 .",
    "the second outburst , an order of magnitude smaller , took place about one binary orbital period later , reaching the peak on september 1 .",
    "on 2005 august 28 when the 2100 kev luminosity was @xmath11 ergs s@xmath1 , the crsf was detected at @xmath12 kev with the _ rxte _ ( wilson & finger 2005 ) . the same feature was confirmed with the _ integral _ spi at @xmath13 kev on august 31 ( kretschmar et al .",
    "these measurements refer to gaussian modeling of the observed absorption features .",
    "the fifth japanese x - ray satellite , _ suzaku _ , was launched on 2005 july 10 .",
    "it carries onboard the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) operating in 0.212 kev ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; kawaharada et al .",
    "2004 ) which covers 1070 kev with pin diodes and 40600 kev with gso scintillators .",
    "we observed a0535 + 262 with _ suzaku _ from 13:40 ut on 2005 september 14 to 01:00 ut the next day , when the source was in the declining phase of the second outburst .",
    "the observation was carried out at `` xis nominal '' pointing position , for a net exposure of 22.3 ksec with the xis and 21.7 ksec with the hxd .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal mode with `` 1/8 window '' option , which gives a time resolution of 1 sec , whereas the hxd was in the nominal mode .",
    "the source was detected with the xis at an intensity of 10 cts s@xmath1 per sensor . in the xis analysis , we excluded all the telemetry saturated data portions , and data taken in  low \" rate mode .",
    "we further removed those time intervals when the source elevation above the earth s limb was below @xmath14 or the spacecraft was in the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "we then accumulated nominal - grade events within 6 mm ( @xmath15 ) of the image centroid .",
    "the xis background spectra were taken from a blank sky observation towards the north ecliptic pole region , conducted for 95 ksec on 2005 september 24 .",
    "the hxd data were screened using the same criteria as for the xis .",
    "in addition , we discarded data taken up to 436 s after leaving the saa , and those acquired during time intervals where the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity was lower than 8 gev / c .",
    "after this filtering , the final hxd event list was obtained only using events that survived the standard anti - concidence function of the hxd .",
    "the non x - ray background of the pin diodes was synthesized by appropriately combining night - earth data sets acquired under different conditions ( kokubun et al .",
    "the gso background was derived from a source - free observation performed on 2005 september 13 , namely , immediately before the pointing onto a0535 + 26 .",
    "the background gso events were accumulated over identical orbital phases of _ suzaku _ as the on - source data integration , resulting in an exposure of 19 ksec .",
    "though rather short , this particular dataset is considered best in minimizing systematic errors associated with the gso background estimation . after subtracting these backgrounds ,",
    "the source was detected significantly at an intensity of 1.4 cts s@xmath1 ( 1070 kev ) with pin , and 0.4 cts s@xmath1 ( 40200 kev ) with gso .",
    "figure [ fig : a0535_spec_av ] shows the background - subtracted xis and hxd spectra of a0535 + 262 , averaged over the whole observation .",
    "the 0.5  100 kev x - ray flux is measured as @xmath16 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath17 , yielding an x - ray luminosity of @xmath18 ergs s@xmath1 in the same band . in figure",
    "[ fig : a0535_spec_av ] , we also show typical pin and gso non x - ray backgrounds , and uncertainties in their reproducibility which are @xmath19 for pin and @xmath20 for gso ; both these estimates are specific to the present observing conditions , and are based on the _ current _ level of instrumental calibration .",
    "thus , the statistical errors are dominant in the pin spectrum , whereas the statistical and systematic errors are comparable in the gso data particularly above 100 kev . the contribution of the cosmic x - ray background is only @xmath21 of the signal , and hence negligible , but it was subtracted in deriving the pin spectrum in figure [ fig : a0535_spec_av ] .",
    "the source pulsations were detected at a barycentric period of 103.375 @xmath22 0.09 sec , over the full xis band and at least up to 100 kev with the hxd .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : a0535_spec_av ] inset , the pulse profiles are similar to those previously obtained with _ ginga _ when the source was 80 times brighter ( mihara 1995 ) ,",
    "although the dip around phase 0.45 , probably caused by absorption , is shallower .    in order to evaluate the hxd spectra in a model - independent manner , we normalized them to those of the crab nebula , acquired in the same detector conditions on 2005 september 15 , immediately after the a0535 + 262 observation .",
    "the resulting `` crab ratios '' , presented in figure  [ fig : crabratio ] , indicate that the source intensity is @xmath23 mcrab at 20 kev .",
    "the ratio keeps rising up to @xmath23 kev , and falls steeply beyond , where the pin and gso data both reveal a clear dip feature centered at @xmath24 kev .",
    "since the crab spectrum is a featureless power - law with a photon index of @xmath25 , we may identify this feature with the crsf of a0535 + 262 observed previously (   [ section : introduction ] ) .",
    "although the crab ratios appear somewhat discrepant between the two hxd components , the effect can be partially explained by different energy resolutions between pin ( @xmath6 3 kev fwhm ) and gso ( @xmath26 kev fwhm at @xmath24 kev ) , coupled with the steeply declining spectra .",
    "the remainder is within the statistical plus systematic uncertainties .    to quantify the inference from figure  [ fig : crabratio ] , we jointly fitted the pin and gso spectra , with the smooth continuum model called npex ( negative and positive power - laws with exponential ; mihara 1995 ; makishima et al .",
    "we left free all but one parameters describing the model ; two normalizations , the negative power - law index ( @xmath27 ) , and the exponential cutoff parameter ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the positive power - law index , @xmath29 , was fixed at 2.0 , representing a wien peak , because it was not well constrained by the fit .",
    "the interstellar absorption was not incorporated , and the relative pin vs. gso normalization was fixed to 1.0 ( nominal value ) .",
    "we limited the gso fitting range to 50100 kev , because of response uncertainties below 50 kev and the systematic background errors above 100 kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a0535_spec_av ] ) .",
    "as presented in figure [ fig : fit]b , the npex model was successful with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) when fitted to the 1225 kev pin data and the 73100 kev gso data ( i.e. , excluding the suggested crsf energy range ) . when the 5073 kev gso data are restored , a worse fit ( @xmath32 )",
    "was obtained as shown in figure [ fig : fit]c .",
    "similarly , inclusion of the 2570 kev pin data ( but discarding the 5073 kev gso data ) resulted in a poor fit , with @xmath33 for @xmath34 ( figure [ fig : fit]d ) .",
    "the fit became completely unacceptable ( @xmath35 with @xmath36 ; figure [ fig : fit]e ) when the entire 1270 kev pin data and the 50100 kev gso spectra are utilized .",
    "thus , the pin and gso data consistently indicate the spectral feature between @xmath37 and @xmath38 kev . this conclusion does not change even considering the systematic background uncertainties ( figure  [ fig : a0535_spec_av ] ) .    to better describe the hxd spectra , we multiplied the npex continuum with a cyclotron absorption ( cyab ) factor ( mihara et al .",
    "1990 ; makishima et al .",
    "1999 ) , and repeated the joint fitting .",
    "we left free the energy @xmath4 , depth @xmath39 , and width @xmath40 of the resonance .",
    "as presented in figures  [ fig : fit]a and f , this npex@xmath41cyab model is successful in reproducing the pin ( 1270 kev ) and the gso ( 50100 kev ) spectra simultaneously , with @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the cyab parameters were constrained as @xmath44@xmath45 kev , @xmath46@xmath47 , and @xmath48@xmath49 kev , where the first ",
    "@xmath22 \" represent statistical 90% errors while the second ones show the effect of systematic background uncertainties .",
    "compared with these , systematic errors in the energy scale determination have smaller effects ; the pin energy scale , reconfirmed by gd - k lines at 43 kev , is accurate to within 1 kev , and that of gso , calibrated by several instrumental lines , is reliable to within a few kev .",
    "in addition , the systematics in the response matrix are also within statistical errors in the present analysis .",
    "the npex parameters became @xmath50@xmath51 , and @xmath52@xmath53 kev , with the positive and negative power - law components crossing over at @xmath54 kev ( green curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "this successful npex@xmath41 cyab fit reinforces our identification of the feature with the previously known crsf .    if we instead adopt a `` power - law times exponential '' continuum with gaussian absorption ( gabs ; kreykenbohm et al .",
    "2004 ) , the hxd data give @xmath55@xmath56 kev , a gaussian sigma of @xmath57@xmath58 kev , and an optical depth of @xmath59@xmath60 .",
    "however , the fit becomes worse ; @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "our data are consistent with the presence of the 2nd harmonic feature at at @xmath63 kev ( see fig [ fig : a0535_spec_av ] ) , but do not require it , given the current status of the hxd calibration . if the model is multiplied by another cyab factor with the center energy and width fixed at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , its depth is constrained as @xmath66 .",
    "we observed a0535 + 262 with _",
    "suzaku _ in a very low luminosity state , @xmath18 ergs s@xmath1 in 0.5100 kev , or @xmath67 ergs s@xmath1 in 350 kev . in spite of the source faintness ( @xmath630 mcrab )",
    ", we successfully detected the crsf at @xmath68 kev , thanks to the wide energy band and high sensitivity of the hxd .",
    "the crsf was as deep as ( or even deeper than ) that in the high luminosity states ; e.g. , @xmath69 when the source was two orders of magnitude more luminous ( kendziorra et al .",
    "1994 ; grove et al .",
    "1995 ) .    except for the case of x persei ( coburn et al .",
    "2001 ) , which exhibits a rather unusual spectrum for an accreting pulsar , the present result provides the detection of a crsf in the lowest luminosity state ever achieved from a binary x - ray pulsar . since the crsf appeared in absorption and not in emission , the thomson optical depth of the accretion column is inferred to be larger than @xmath610 even with this low luminosity , according to the nagel model ( 1981 ) .",
    "this conclusion is independently supported by the fact that the pulse profiles ( figure  [ fig : a0535_spec_av ] ) do not differ significantly from those observed in much more luminous outbursts .    in figure [",
    "fig : nakajimaplot ] , we plot the crsf energy of a0535 + 262 versus the 350 kev luminosity at 2 kpc , @xmath70 , as measured by _ suzaku _ and by previous missions . for consistency with previous works ,",
    "the _ suzaku _ result plotted here is from the gabs modeling .",
    "the cyclotron resonance energy of a0535 + 262 is thus constant within @xmath71 , even though the luminosity changed by nearly two orders of magnitude from @xmath72 to @xmath73 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the implied magnetic field strength , @xmath74 gauss , is considered to represent a value intrinsic to this object , which is most likely that on the neutron star surface .    figure [ fig : nakajimaplot ] also presents results on the other two pulsars , 4u0115 + 63 and x0331 + 53 , mentioned in ",
    "[ section : introduction ] .",
    "the three objects behave in rather different ways on the @xmath70 vs. @xmath4 plane . while 4u0115 + 63 and x0331 + 53 both exhibit luminosity - dependent changes in @xmath4 , the threshold luminosity at which the resonance energy starts changing is significantly different . in addition , a0535 + 262",
    "does not show such behavior at least up to @xmath75 erg s@xmath1 .    considering that accreting x - ray pulsars should form",
    "a family described by a rather small number of parameters , one possibility suggested by figure [ fig : nakajimaplot ] is that the @xmath70 vs. @xmath4 relation depends systematically on some of the parameters , e.g. , the surface field strength itself . comparing 4u0115 + 63 and x0331 + 53",
    ", we may speculate that @xmath4 starts changing at a higher luminosity if the object has a higher surface magnetic field .",
    "if this is correct , we would expect the resonance energy of a0535 + 262 to change at luminosities much higher than so far sampled , because it has the highest magnetic field among known crsf pulsars .",
    "alternatively , the values of @xmath70 in figure   [ fig : nakajimaplot ] may be subject to systematic errors , due , e.g. , to uncertainties in the source distance , and/or to the anisotropy of emission that is inherent to x - ray pulsars .",
    "( the luminosities are all calculated assuming isotropic emission . )",
    "if the luminosity is corrected for these factors , the behavior of @xmath4 in figure  [ fig : nakajimaplot ] might become essentially the same among the three objects .    to distinguish between these two possibilities ( or to arrive at yet another alternative ) , we need further observations . in either case , it must be examined whether the variable column - height scenario , which was successful on 4u0115 + 63 ( mihara et al . 1998 , 2004 ; nakajima et al .",
    "2006 ) , can be applied also to a0535 + 262 and x0331 + 53 .",
    "the authors would like to thank all the members of the _ suzaku _ science working group , for their contributions in the instrument preparation , spacecraft operation , software development , and in - orbit instrumental calibration ."
