    "the theory of random matrices , introduced by wigner in the 1950s , has proved to be a very useful tool in many fields of physics , from localisation theory to quantum transport ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in quantum chaos , a well accepted conjecture states that wigner - dyson random matrix ensembles describe statistical properties of spectra of quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic @xcite , while statistics of integrable systems is best described by poisson statistics of independent random variables @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wave functions are extended in the chaotic case and localised in the integrable case .",
    "the choice of the random matrix ensemble suited to describe the statistical behaviour of a system depends on the symmetries of that system . in the usual setting @xcite ,",
    "standard random matrix ensembles consist of matrices @xmath1 with independent gaussian random elements whose measure is invariant over conjugation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an arbitrary matrix belonging to one of the three following groups of matrices : unitary , orthogonal , or symplectic .",
    "the unitary group defines the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , which is supposed to describe statistical properties of energy levels of chaotic systems without time - reversal invariance .",
    "the orthogonal group corresponds to gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , used for time - reversal invariant chaotic systems .",
    "the symplectic group gives rise to gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) , applicable to time - reversal chaotic systems with half - integer spin without rotational symmetry .",
    "though many extensions and generalisations of random matrices have been proposed in order to best describe various models @xcite , the existence of a large invariance group as in ( [ invariance ] ) remains their characteristic feature . without such invariance",
    "it is very difficult to connect analytically simple properties of matrix elements with complex properties of matrix eigenvalues . for all random matrix ensembles with invariance group",
    "it is possible to integrate over unnecessary variables in order to get explicitly the joint distribution of eigenvalues under the form @xmath4 with @xmath5 a system - dependent potential and @xmath6 a parameter . for the gaussian ensembles the potential is quadratic and the parameter @xmath6 is equal to 1 for goe , 2 for gue , and 4 for gse .",
    "all correlation functions for invariant ensembles can be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "however the resulting formulas are cumbersome . for the nearest - neighbour distribution @xmath7 , instead of",
    "the exact expression one often uses a simple surmise proposed by wigner .",
    "this surmise has correct functional dependence at small and large argument and takes the form @xmath8 with constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 determined from the normalisation conditions @xmath11 the wigner - type surmise for the probability @xmath12 that between two eigenvalues separated by @xmath13 there exist exactly @xmath14 other levels ( with @xmath15 ) is @xcite @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are fixed by the normalisations @xmath19    while for chaotic systems it is possible to argue that eigenstates may statistically be invariant under rotations , this is not the case for more general models . in order to describe statistical properties of such systems",
    "one has to consider non - invariant ensembles of random matrices .",
    "one of the most investigated examples is the three - dimensional anderson model @xcite , with on - site disorder and nearest - neighbour coupling .",
    "depending on the strength of the disorder , it can display metallic behaviour well described by standard random matrix ensembles , or insulator behaviour with poisson - like spectrum .",
    "however , at the metal - insulator transition , spectral statistics are of an intermediate type and are not described by invariant ensembles  @xcite .",
    "similar behaviours have been observed in pseudo - integrable billiards @xcite , quantum maps corresponding to diffractive classical maps @xcite , or quantum hall transitions @xcite .",
    "models have been proposed to describe such intermediate statistics @xcite , and random matrix ensembles which possess similar features have been constructed , e.g.  power - law random banded matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to construct random matrix ensembles which are not invariant over rotations of eigenstates , but whose joint distributions of eigenvalues can nevertheless be calculated analytically .",
    "a short version of the paper has been published in @xcite .",
    "all of these ensembles have intermediate statistics , and for certain of them spectral correlation functions , e.g. the nearest - neighbour distribution , are obtained explicitly .",
    "eigenfunctions of these ensembles are neither localised ( as for integrable systems ) nor extended ( as for chaotic models ) but have fractal properties @xcite .",
    "random matrices of the proposed critical ensembles are constructed from the lax matrices of classical integrable models .",
    "these models are systems of @xmath0 classical particles labelled by an index @xmath20 , @xmath21 in a one - dimensional space .",
    "each particle @xmath20 is characterised by its position in space @xmath22 and its momentum @xmath23 .",
    "the dynamics of the particles is entirely described by the hamiltonian @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the characteristic property of these models is the existence of a pair of @xmath27 matrices @xmath28 and @xmath1 , called the lax pair of the system @xcite , such that the equations of motion ( the hamilton equations , derived from the system hamiltonian ) are equivalent to @xmath29 the lax matrix @xmath28 is a matrix depending on momenta @xmath30 and coordinates @xmath31 . we propose to consider these lax matrices as random matrices with a certain natural measure of random variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 the explicit form of this measure depends on the system and will be discussed below .",
    "we do not impose any dynamics on variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the only information we use from the integrability of the underlying classical system is the existence and explicit form of action - angle variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , it is well known that the transformation from momenta and coordinates to action - angle variables is canonical , so that @xmath37 direct proof that the transformation is canonical is difficult in general , and implicit methods have been used to establish it for specific systems @xcite-@xcite . in the models we consider here , action variables turn out to be the eigenvalues @xmath38 of the lax matrix , or a simple function of them . the canonical change of variables from momenta and coordinates to action - angle variables in ( [ measure_pq ] ) leads to a formal relation @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the exact joint distribution of eigenvalues is then obtained by integration over angle variables , which can easily be performed in all cases considered , and yields @xmath41 this scheme is general and can be adapted to many different models .",

    "we briefly present the construction of the action - angle variables and choose a natural measure of random momenta and coordinates which allows an easy change of variables as in ( [ measure_lphi ] ) .",
