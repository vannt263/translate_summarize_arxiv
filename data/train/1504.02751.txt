    "the incidence of poliomyelitis is tracked by the acute flaccid paralysis ( afp ) surveillance and global polio laboratory network @xcite .",
    "the certification period to declare that a polio serotype has been eliminated from a previously endemic region with certification - standard surveillance is three or more years without a polio case associated with indigenous wpv circulation@xcite .",

    "the operational , humanitarian , and financial requirements support the need for specific , data - driven estimates of the likely period of silent polio persistence .",
    "the need for specific silent duration estimates is especially important in the context of the plan to stop all use of trivalent oral polio vaccine ( topv ) in april 2016 and replace it with bivalent opv ( bopv ) containing only serotypes 1 and 3 to prevent the seeding of new type 2 circulating vaccine - derived polio ( cvdpv2 ) outbreaks @xcite .",

    "the model is based on four premises : ( 1 ) that elimination only depends on the last few hundred to few thousand infections in a much larger population , ( 2 ) that we only need to see one more case to know elimination did not occur , ( 3 ) that we do not care where infected people are located because afp surveillance will find any cases in proportion to the surveillance sensitivity , and ( 4 ) that the few remaining pockets of infection have similar transmission dynamics to the many sources of polio cases in the past .",

    "thus , this author believes it will be reasonable to conclude that africa is wild - polio free if no new wpv cases are seen by the end of 2015 .",
    "this estimate for time to elimination of at most 14 months is significantly shorter than estimated in previous work @xcite because the model takes into account the low infection prevalence at the time of the most recent case that is implied by the long interval between the most recently observed cases .    for cvdpv2 , despite the dramatic reduction in incidence implied by the lack of new cases since november 2014",
    ", we must be cautious about concluding too soon that the established lineages are gone .",
    "the low case to infection ratio of type 2 makes it the most difficult strain to detect at low prevalence , and the high rate of incidence in 2014 implies that the reservoir of existing silent infections in november 2014 was approximately 22 times larger for cvdpv2 than for wpv1 at the time of its last case .",
    "the larger reservoir delays elimination even with sufficient herd immunity . furthermore",
    ", continued topv use may lead to new cvdpv emergences in populations with insufficient herd immunity .",
    "the disappearance of cases indicates that substantial improvement in type 2 immunity has significantly reduced the national incidence rate , but the historical stability of the effective reproductive number near 1 suggests that the dynamics in the populations that continue to transmit are more stable than the national trend overall .",
    "estimates here apply only to the known endemic lineages and new emergences may change expectations for the time to complete cvdpv2 elimination even if no new cases are seen from the established lineages .",
    "the above points suggest to this author that it would be reasonable for the polio program in nigeria to place more emphasis on cvdpv2 prevention by the end of 2015 .",
    "however , until the world is wild - polio - free , the risk of the re - importation of wpv1 must be balanced with the risk of ongoing cvdpv2 transmission and new cvdpv emergence .",
    "furthermore , certification of polio - free status is a stringent goal [ line - through]*wiith*with additional requirements for surveillance and specimen containment @xcite , and so these estimates need to be considered in that context .",
    "the model was designed to help policymakers manage that balance .",
    "involved parties may use the probabilities over time to weight different scenarios and inform their planning @xcite , and the model can be easily extended to consider alternative scenarios about the future dynamics of the force of infection .",
    "if a new case is detected , then these model predictions are no longer valid . however , since the silent periods as of march 31 , 2015 are much longer than typical , a new case would likely represent one of two scenarios",
    ". it would either be the last orphan case very near elimination , or it will be the first case of a new outbreak for which more cases will shortly follow . in the event another case occurs but is not followed by an outbreak , this analysis can be repeated to provide updated estimates . in the event of an outbreak ,",
    "surveillance sensitivity is not the primary policy concern .",
    "the model assumes that the balance of birth and vaccination maintains stationary dynamics for the force of infection with constant mean infection growth rate and random variability . with additional data about birth demographics and vaccination activities",
    ", this model can be extended to include non - random structure in the statistical model of the force of infection .",
    "one could inform such models by correlating the apparently random changes in the force of infection with the supplemental vaccination calendar @xcite to estimate how future campaigns may affect the force of infection and subsequent probability of elimination .",
    "the model is based solely on afp surveillance and ignores any role for alternative active surveillance strategies such as environmental surveillance @xcite .",
    "certification - quality afp surveillance provides a representative sample from all populations regardless of location .",
    "it is not obvious how to include environmental surveillance ( es ) in the model because es is only sensitive at fixed locations , but the model makes no assumptions about spatial structure .",
    "furthermore , at a given es site , there is not yet any practical way to quantify the meaning of a negative sample . and",
    "while positive environmental samples provide unambiguous evidence of local transmission at the time of the sample , we do not yet know how to quantify the effect of a positive sample on quantitative estimates of prevalence and thus future elimination probabilty . because es can dramatically improve the sensitivity in well - characterized populations @xcite , the role of es in certifying elimination warrants further empirical and theoretical study .",
    "* added july 10 , 2015 : * after this paper was submitted , the gpei reported an environmental sample from march ( kaduna state , nigeria ) that was positive for cvdpv2 from an established lineage @xcite , and a new case from the same lineage with a date of onset of may16 , 2015 was reported on june 30 in the federal capital territory , confirming the predictions of this paper that cvdpv2 elimination was unlikely at that time and that a new case was likely within a few months of march 31 , 2015 .",
    "the model estimates that this one case does not significantly change the forecast for cvdpv2 elimination by april 2016 .",
    "this perhaps counter - intuitive result occurs because the new case is consistent with a substantial drop in cvdvp2 prevalence over the last 6 months .",
    "the median predicted time to the next case is 2 months under the most likely scenario for the future effective reproductive number .",
    "if another case with a date of onset prior to the end of july 2015 is observed , then it will be likely that cvdpv2 prevalence is rising , and this would lead to significantly more pessimisitc forecasts for cvdpv2 elimination by april 2016 .",
    "i will continue to provide updated forecasts if new cases occur .",

    "since the case - to - infection ratios above describe paralysis - susceptible infections only , and the statistical model for the force of infection is based on paralytic cases only , the model of new infections explicitly represents only infections in the cohort of people who are susceptible to paralysis .",

    "<S> wild poliovirus type 3 ( wpv3 ) has not been seen anywhere since the last case of wpv3-associated paralysis in nigeria in november 2012 . at the time of writing , </S>",
    "<S> the most recent case of wild poliovirus type 1 ( wpv1 ) in nigeria occurred in july 2014 , and wpv1 has not been seen in africa since a case in somalia in august 2014 . </S>",
    "<S> no cases associated with circulating vaccine - derived type 2 poliovirus ( cvdpv2 ) have been detected in nigeria since november 2014 . </S>",
    "<S> has wpv1 been eliminated from africa ? </S>",
    "<S> has wpv3 been eradicated globally ? has nigeria interrupted cvdpv2 transmission ? </S>",
    "<S> these questions are difficult because polio surveillance is based on paralysis and paralysis only occurs in a small fraction of infections .    </S>",
    "<S> this report provides estimates for the probabilities of poliovirus elimination in nigeria given available data as of march 31 , 2015 . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on a model of disease transmission that is built from historical polio incidence rates and is designed to represent the uncertainties in transmission dynamics and poliovirus detection that are fundamental to interpreting long time periods without cases .    </S>",
    "<S> the model estimates that , as of march 31 , 2015 , the probability of wpv1 elimination in nigeria is @xmath0 , and that if wpv1 has not been eliminated , a new case will be detected with @xmath1 probability by the end of 2015 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of wpv3 elimination ( and thus global eradication ) is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is unlikely that the ongoing transmission of cvdpv2 has been interrupted ; the probability of cvdpv2 elimination rises to @xmath3 if no new cases are detected by april 2016 .    </S>",
    "<S> * added july 10 , 2015 * : on june 26 , 2015 , a paralytic polio case caused by ongoing circulation of established cvdpv2 lineage was confirmed by the global polio laboratory network . </S>",
    "<S> the date of paralysis onset was may 16 , 2015 , 181 days after the previous case . </S>",
    "<S> the case provides new information about the prevalence of cvdpv2 in nigeria that can be used to both assess the accuracy of the predictions for elimination and case detection in the first version of the paper and provide the basis for an updated forecast for the time to cvdpv2 elimination if no cases are detected .    </S>",
    "<S> the model predictions for cvdpv2 pepared on march 31 , 2015 proved to be accurate : elimination did not occur and the observed case occurred within the @xmath4 prediction interval . </S>",
    "<S> the updated forecasts predict that this one case has little impact on the estimates for the probability of elimination by april 2016 . </S>",
    "<S> this counter - intuitive result was found because the 6-month silent interval following the previous 13-day interval indicates that cvdpv2 prevalence has fallen roughly 16-fold in nigeria since november 2014 and that the recent mean effective reproductive number for ongoing cvdpv2 transmission in nigeria is below 1 . under the most likely scenario for the transmission dynamics in the near future , the median time to the date of onset of the next case if elimination does not occur is july 15 , 2015 .    </S>",
    "<S> i intend to provide further updates to this manuscript if new cases occur . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that if another case occurs before the end of july 2015 , it will likely indicate increasing prevalence and so forecasts for elimination by april 2016 would then be more pessimistic . </S>"
