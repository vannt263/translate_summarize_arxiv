    "hiv1pr is a homodimer , that is a protein whose native conformation is built of two ( identical ) disjoint chains each of them made of 99 amino acids .",
    "sedimentation equilibrium experiments have shown that at neutral ph the protease folds according to a three  state mechanism ( @xmath0 ) , populating consistently the monomeric native conformation @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the dimer dissociation constant ( @xmath2 ) is @xmath3 at room temperature , while the folding temperature of the monomer , i.e. the temperature at which the free energy of the native monomeric state @xmath1 is equal to that of the unfolded state @xmath4 is @xmath5c @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the folding of three  state homodimers @xcite indicate that after the monomers have reached the native state @xmath1 , they diffuse to find another folded monomer to associate with .",
    "the same study also shows that in the stage @xmath6 , each monomer folds according to the same mechanism controlling the folding of single domain proteins .",
    "this mechanism is reasonably well understood as a result , among other things , of extensive lattice model studies as well as of all  atom off  latice g ",
    "model simulations ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "these studies revealed the central role played by few , strongly interacting highly conserved , as a rule hydrophobic , amino acids .",
    "mutations of these `` hot '' amino acids lead , in general , to denaturation @xcite . it has been shown @xcite that , starting from an unfolded conformation , folding proceeds following a hierarchical succession of events : 1 ) formation of les stabilized by the interaction among `` hot '' amino acids lying close along the polypeptide chain , 2 ) docking of the les into the ( post critical ) folding nucleus , that is formation of the minimum set of local contacts which brings the system over the major free energy barrier of the whole folding process , 3 ) relaxation of the remaining amino acids on the native structure shortly after the formation of the folding nucleus . strong support for the soundness of this hierarchical scenario is found in a number of circumstantial evidences @xcite .",
    "the same model @xcite suggests that it is possible to destabilize the native conformation of a protein with the help of peptides whose sequences are identical to those of the les of the protein @xcite",
    ". such peptides ( p  les ) interact with the protein ( in particular with their complementary les ) with the same energy which stabilizes its folding nucleus , thus competing with its formation .",
    "one can mention two advantages of these non  conventional ( folding ) inhibitors as compared to conventional ( active site centerd ) inhibitors : i ) their molecular structure is direclty fixed by that of the target protein .",
    "one has thus not to design a molecule so as to optimize its interaction with a given site of the enzyme , but just find which are the les of the protein to be inhibited .",
    "the design of the p  les having been performed by evolution .",
    "in fact , like the pair enzyme / substrate , pairs of complementary les have evolved through millions of years in order to learn how to recognize its partners as well as to avoid aggregation , ii ) it is unlikely that the protein can develop drug  resistance through mutations as les are stabilized by hot amino acids .",
    "the present paper is divided in two main parts . a theoretical one ( sections 2 and 3 ) where the prediction of the model are presented , and an experimental one ( sect .",
    "4 ) , where the properties of the designed inhibitor are tested .",
    "the first step to be taken in the design of an inhibitor of the hiv1pr following the strategy discussed in the previous section is to determine the les of the target protein . in other words , segments of the protein containing highly conserved residues . to this scope use",
    "is made of evolution data input as well as model simulations .",
    "a measure of the degree of conservation of residues in a family of proteins is the entropy per site @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the frequency of appearence of residue of type @xmath9 at site i. making use of a family of 28 uncorrelated proteins ( i.e. , displaying sequence similarity lower than 25% ) structurally similar to hiv1pr @xcite , the entropy @xmath10 was calculated for all 99 sites of the monomers . from the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ( continous curve ) it is observed that the most conserved regions of the proteins involve residues 24 - 33 , 56 - 61 and 81 - 87 .",
    "note that the conservation of residues 25 - 27 is not unexpected in that they build the active site of the protease .",
    "another important source of information concerning protected sites of the hiv1pr stems from drug - induced mutations observed in vivo .",
    "the large production of virion in the cell , coupled with the error prone reverse transcriptase enzyme , eventually leads to escape mutants .",
    "mutations observed in the stretches of the hiv1pr mentioned above are , as a rule , conservative mutations ( e.g. l24i ) @xcite .",
    "less conservative mutations , e.g. hydrophobic to hydrophilic , are absent from these structurally protected regions .      in order to become stable at an early stage of the folding process ,",
    "les must carry a significant fraction of the total energy of the protein .",
    "we have calculated this quantity making use of short all - atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water using gromacs software @xcite .",
    "the calculation was performed at 295 k for 1 ns , during which the protein fluctuates around its native conformation ( the maximum rmsd being 11@xmath11 ) .",
    "we have followed the scheme described in ref .",
    "@xcite , calculating the average interaction energy @xmath12 between any pair of amino acids during the 1ns dynamics and extracting the eigenvalues @xmath13 of the resulting matrix @xmath14 .",
    "the lowest energy state ( @xmath15=-121.2 kj / mol ) displays a large energy gap ( i.e. -12.9 kj / mol@xmath16 ) with respect to the next eigenvalue , indicating a core of strongly interacting amino acids @xcite .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) the eigenvector associated with the lowest energy eigenvalue , which highlights to which extent the different amino acids participate to this core .",
    "the largest amplitudes involve residues 2532 , 5765 , 7477 and 8390 .",
    "regions 2532 , 5765 and 8390 overlap well with the conserved regions mentioned above in connection with fig . [ fig1](a ) .    another way of representing the interaction matrix @xmath14 is to consider the interaction between fragments @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . as can be seen from table [ table1 ] , the corresponding @xmath25 energy map is essentially codiagonal , the associated energy of the interacting chain segment being @xmath26 kj / mol as compared to the md simulation native energy @xmath27 kj / mol .",
    "in other words , the @xmath28 representation of the folded monomer accounts for @xmath29 of the calculated native conformation energy .",
    "in particular , the interaction between fragments @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is stabilized by @xmath34 kj / mol equal to 32% of the native conformation energy . of this",
    "energy 20% ( @xmath35 kj / mol ) corresponds to the internal energy of the four fragments , while 12% ( @xmath36 kj / mol ) corresponds to the summed interaction energy between fragments .    in keeping with the above",
    "results the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 segments qualify as les ( folding units ) of each of the two monomers of the hiv-1-pr dimer , les which form in their native conformation the ( post critical ) folding nucleus ( fn ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that drug induced mutations in the amino acids belonging to these les ( l24i , d30n , l33f , l63v , i64v , v77i , v82a , i84d , n88d and l90 m @xcite ) , lead to a folding nucleus energy equal to -1500 kj / mol , as compared to -796 kj / mol for the wild type sequence fn , that is to increase of almost a factor of 2 in the stability of the system .",
    "wallqvist and coworkers@xcite investigated the hiv1pr molecule for the occurence of cooperative folding units that exhibit a relatively stronger protection against unfolding than other parts of the molecule .",
    "unfolding penalities are calculated forming all possible combinations of interactions between segments of the native conformation and making use of a knowledge  based potential . this procedure identifies a folding core in hiv1pr comprising residues 2232 , 7478 and 8491 , residues that form a spatially close unit of a helix ( 8491 ) with sheet ( 7478 ) above another @xmath37strand ( ( 2225 ) , containing the active site residues d25 , t26 and g27 ) perpendicular to these elements .    making use of a gaussian network model , bahar and coworkers @xcite have studied the normal modes about the native conformation of hiv1pr .",
    "`` hot '' residues , playing a key role in the stability of the protein , are defined as those displaying the fastest modes . in this way regions 2232 , 7478 and 8491",
    "are identified as those forming the folding core of the protein .",
    "these regions match with those displaying low experimental debye - weller factors , that is low fluctuations in the crystallographic structure .",
    "calculation of @xmath38values by means of g  model simulations performed by levy and coworkers @xcite have located a major transition state where only regions 2735 and 7987 are structured .",
    "the protein then reaches the native state , overcoming another minor transition state , and subsequently dimerizes into the biologically active structure .",
    "cecconi and coworkers @xcite have calculated the stability temperatures associated with each contact of the protease , again making use of a g  model .",
    "they find that key sites to the stability of partially folded states , that is those displaying the lowest stability temperatures , are 22 , 29 , 32 , 76 , 84 and 86 .      to directly investigate the folding mechanism of the hiv1pr monomer",
    ", use is made of a simplified model which has proven useful to account for the folding properties of a number of small , single ",
    "domain proteins @xcite .",
    "the model pictures each amino acid as a spherical bead , making inextensible links with the rest of the chain .",
    "each pair of amino acid interacts through a modified g ",
    "contact potential @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coordinate of the @xmath41th amino acid , @xmath42 is a contact function which assumes the value @xmath43 if the @xmath41th and @xmath44th residues are closer than @xmath45 and zero otherwise , @xmath12 being the energy matrix elements defined in sect .",
    "moreover , each amino acid displays a hard core of @xmath46 .",
    "equilibrium monte carlo simulations of the hiv1pr monomer provide free energy landscapes as a function of the fraction @xmath47 of native energy of the protein .",
    "the free energy at @xmath48 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) with a solid curve , displays two major wells , corresponding to the unfolded and the native states .",
    "the grey beads mark conformations met during the sampling , and their position along the y  axis indicate the associated rmsd ( cf .",
    "scale on the left y - axis ) . note that the native well is quite broad , ranging from @xmath49 to @xmath50 and from an rmsd of 3 to 7 @xmath11 .",
    "also the free energy barrier to the unfolded state is rather small , being about 18 kj / mol ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "these data indicate a two  state transition characterized by a weak degree of collectivity . to be noted that in the present calculations we only considered the monomeric form of the protein .",
    "dimerization can increase the stability and the collectivity of the system .    making use of the same model it is possible to run dynamical simulations , starting from random conformation and following the folding to the native state .",
    "the overall dynamics can be followed through the plot of @xmath52(t)$ ] , that is the fractional native energy as a function of time , averaged over 100 independent runs .",
    "the result is displayed as a solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , indicating an exponential process of characteristic time @xmath53s , consistent with the two  well picture .",
    "the model provides also information about the formation of each contact , through the probability @xmath54 that the contact between residues @xmath41 and @xmath44 is formed at time @xmath55 .",
    "a number of native contacts are stabilized early ( sub  nanosecond time scale ) following an exponential dynamics .",
    "this is the case for contacts belonging to @xmath30 ( 2528 ) and in particular to @xmath33 ( e.g. contacts 8689 , 8790 , 8992 , 9093 ) .",
    "contacts between residues which are far along the chain are formed later , following a non  exponential dynamics , which indicate that their formation is dependent on some other event .",
    "the earliest involve the interaction between fragments @xmath56 and @xmath57 which take place after an average time of few and of tens of ns , respectively .",
    "as an example we display in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) the formation probability of the contact 31 - 89 as a function of time .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) is summarized the hierarchy of formation of native contacts of hiv1pr , the different gray levels corresponding to different time scales , while in table [ table2 ] are listed the parameters associated to the selected contacts .",
    "the picture that emerges is that local contacts within fragments 8393 , between residues 2528 and in the beta ",
    "hairpin 4258 form first .",
    "then the beta  turns 1518 and 6570 , again built of local residues .",
    "the next event is the assembly of the nucleus involving fragments 2234 and 8393 , which is further stabilized by the contribution of the strongly  interacting bend 7783 .",
    "finally , the rest of the residues come to place .",
    "summing up , the model suggests that les are built of residues which lie in the regions 8393 and 2234 .",
    "this essentially agrees with the indirect indications provided by the studies of levy and coworkers @xcite , which indicate the formation of regions 2735 and 7987 as determinant for the folding of the protein .",
    "the stabilization core @xcite is somewhat larger ( cf .",
    "[ sect_energy ] ) , involving , besides residues 8493 and 2234 , also the regions 5666 and 7478 .    from the above discussion",
    "one can conclude that peptides p  s@xmath58 and p ",
    "s@xmath59 are the most likely candidates as folding inhibitors of the hiv1pr monomer . because @xmath33 is well structured ( it builds 10 internal contacts and an @xmath60-helix turn ) ,",
    "while @xmath30 has little internal structure , we shall select p  s@xmath59 as the best candidate for a non  conventional inhibitor .",
    "it is expected that peptides p ",
    "s@xmath59 will efficiently attach to the @xmath30les , thus blocking the formation of the folding nucleus or , in the case the protein is already folded , by profiting favourable fluctuations around the native conformation , to come into contact with the @xmath30les thus blocking the return of the monomer to the original native conformation .",
    "within the framework of the g model discussed above , monte carlo simulations were carried out for a system composed of a single 99mer and a number ( from 1 to 5 ) of p - s@xmath59 peptides , placed inside a box of side of 100 @xmath11 with periodic boundary conditions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3a](a ) the resulting free energy of the protein as a function of @xmath47 is displayed .",
    "the presence of p ",
    "s@xmath59 peptides has a number of effects : a ) it broadens the minimum associated with the native conformation , b ) it lowers by @xmath61 the free energy of the minimum associated with the unfolded state , c ) it lowers by about the same amount the free energy of the maximum of the barrier separating the two minima ( transition state ) .",
    "these effects are associated with a decrease of the relative population of the native state from 0.98 to 0.78 in the case of 3 peptides and to 0.52 in the case of 5 peptides .",
    "because the above results were obtained from calculations which describe the system at equilibrium they apply equally well to situations in which one starts with the monomer in the state n or in state u.    to test the validity of these results , we have repeated the simulations using peptides corresponding to fragments of the protease monomers different from the les , but having a similar number of amino acids .",
    "it is found that e.g. , fragments 919 and 6170 do not have any significant effect on the free energy of the native state ( cf . fig . [ fig3a](b ) ) .",
    "this result testifies to the fact that the denaturing effect observed in the results shown in fig [ fig3a](a ) is due not to some unspecific interaction between the peptides and the protein , but to the very choice of les  mimicking peptides .    to further clarify the mechanism which is at the basis of the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3a](a ) , we display in fig . [ fig3b](b ) a snapshot of the simulation carried out with 3 peptides .",
    "it is seen that one of the p ",
    "s@xmath59 peptides has built ( strong ) contacts stabilizing the folding nucleus of the protein .",
    "consequently , the state corresponding to the correctly folded monomer ( fig .",
    "[ fig3b](a ) ) and to the state in which the peptide binds to the partially folded protein have similar energies but very different free energies .",
    "in fact , the main difference between the two conformations displayed in fig . [ fig3b](a ) and [ fig3b](b ) is entropic : while the partially folded protein has a much larger entropy as compared to the folded protein ( which essentially is in a single conformation ) , the complexed state is penalized by the entropy decrease associated with the binding of a single peptide , decrease which can be reduced at will by increasing the number of peptides .    consequently , whatever the folding entropy cost of binding a p  s@xmath59 is , there exists a concentration of peptides which makes the complexed , partially ",
    "unfolded state favourable . in the case of the present simulations , a concentration of peptides equal to few times that of the protein seems to be adequate to consistently destabilize the protease",
    "we have also analyzed the effect pointlike mutations of the mutated site @xmath41 with all its neighbour sites @xmath44 from the original ( negative ) value to @xmath62.]on the hiv1pr have on the inhibitng ability of p  s@xmath59 peptides .",
    "mutations on sites not belonging to les have little or no effect on the stability of the protease , but at the same time do not affect the inhibitory action of p  s@xmath59 . for example , mutations on site 73 cause the protease to decrease its stability at 300 k from @xmath63 ( observed for the `` wild  type '' sequence ) to @xmath64 , the effect of 3 p  s@xmath59 peptides leading to a decrease of this stability from @xmath64 to @xmath65 ( to be compared with the @xmath63 to @xmath66 decrease observed in the case of the `` wild  type '' sequence ) .",
    "mutations in sites belonging to the les of the hiv1pr , on the other hand , cause destabilization of the native state of the protease , shifting the equilibrium distribution of the order parameter @xmath47 towards lower values .",
    "for example , mutation in site 34 causes the stability of the protease to diminish to @xmath67 ( from the value of @xmath63 ) .",
    "following the theoretical predictions discussed above , we have investigated the inhibitory properties of the peptide of sequence niigrnlltqi ( p@xmath68 8393 ) by means of a spectrophotometric assay as described in ref . @xcite and making use of ultraviolet circular dichroism @xcite .",

    "a regression of the absorbance at 300 nm against substrate concentration allows to estimate the extinction coefficient of the whole substrate ( @xmath70 ) .",

    "although a lineweaver - burk plot like that displayed in [ fig4](a ) is usually interpreted in terms of a non - competitive kind of inhibition , it can also describe the case of a irreversible binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme @xcite .",
    "in fact , in a reaction of the kind ( where @xmath106p ",
    "s@xmath59 ) @xmath107 where the rates @xmath108 and @xmath109 are much smaller than @xmath110 and @xmath111 , one can consider the concentration @xmath112 $ ] as constant on a time scale smaller than @xmath113 , and given by @xmath112 = ( k_{-i } /k_{+i } ) ( [ e]_0-[ei])[i]_0 $ ] . in this context , irreversibility means that on the time scale relevant for the experiment the dissociation of ei into e and i is negligible . the concentration of enzyme available to the equilibrium with substrate is then , on this time scale , @xmath114_0-[ei]$ ] . this leads to a michaelis - menten equation identical to that associated with non - competitive inhibition , of the form @xmath115_0[e]_0\\left(1+\\frac{[i]_0}{k_i}\\right)^{-1}k_{cat}}{[s]+k_m}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath116 .",
    "note that the difference between the irreversible scenario and the reversible competitive case is that , in the former , @xmath112 $ ] is proportional to @xmath117 $ ] while in the latter @xmath112 $ ] is proportional to the free enzyme concentration @xmath114 $ ] .",
    "such irreversible scenario is not unexpected in the case of folding inhibitors , where the inhibitor binds tightly to the enzyme ( as tight as the interactions which stabilize the protein ) , the unfolding rate being of the order of @xmath118 @xcite , giving rise to a value of @xmath119 of the order of minutes .",
    "the peptide p  s@xmath59 ( @xmath12083n , 84i , 85i , 86 g , 87r , 88n , 89l , 90l , 91 t , 92q , 93i ) displaying a sequence identical to that of the s@xmath59 les of each of the two identical chains forming the hiv1pr homodimer is found to be a highly specific and likely quite efficient inhibitor ( @xmath121 ) of the folding of the 99mers , and thus of the whole enzyme .",
    "a remarkable property of this inhibitor is that it is unlikely that it would allow for escape mutants .",
    "in fact , the only mutations which will prevent p  s@xmath59 from acting are expected to involve protein denaturation .",
    "obvious disadvantages of the present design are the length and the peptidic character of the inhibitor , because it is not clear how to prevent the degradation by cellular enzymes . consequently , there are two clear tasks lying ahead .",
    "one , to investigate whether the shortening of p  s@xmath59 , by leaving out some residues either at the beginning or at the end ( or both ) , lead to peptides which still inhibit folding with similar specificity and effectiveness as p",
    " s@xmath59 does .",
    "the second is to develop molecules mimetic to p ",
    "s@xmath59 or eventually to shorter peptides derived from p  s@xmath59 .        .the all atom molecular dynamics energy map of the eight amino acid chain segments with which one can represent in an economic fashion each of the two hiv1pr monomers .",

    "<S> being hiv1pr an essential enzyme in the viral life cycle , its inhibition can control aids . because the folding of single domain proteins , like hiv1pr is controlled by local elementary structures ( les , folding units stabilized by strongly interacting , highly conserved amino acids ) which have evolved over myriads of generations to recognize and strongly attract each other so as to make the protein fold fast , we suggest a novel type of hiv1pr inhibitors which interfere with the folding of the protein : short peptides displaying the same amino acid sequence of that of les . theoretical and experimental evidence for the specificity and efficiency of such inhibitors are presented . </S>"
