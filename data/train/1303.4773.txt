    "the freezing of a disordered colloidal or nano suspension into a crystalline state with long - range order is a first - order phase transition that typically follows the nucleation and growth scenario  @xcite .",
    "while the stable crystalline phase is favored energetically , the interface with the disordered phase penalizes small nuclei and leads to a free energy barrier .",
    "hence , for crystallization to commence , one has to wait for a rare fluctuation that results in a large enough _ critical nucleus _ , which subsequently grows until it spans the system .",
    "this implies that by avoiding nucleation the density of a suspension can be increased beyond the thermodynamic freezing density .",
    "such a metastable state is called _",
    "supersaturated_. simple expressions for the free energy barrier can be obtained within classical nucleation theory ( cnt )  @xcite , which assumes a spherical nucleus .    subjecting a colloidal suspension to shear flow drives the system out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "consequently , the concept of a free - energy is no longer well - defined and , strictly speaking , cnt can not be applied anymore",
    ". nevertheless , sheared colloidal suspensions still crystallize but with nucleation and growth kinetics that may be significantly altered from those in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "one might even find a dynamical coexistence of liquid and solid phases  @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the effects of shear flow on the crystallization rate are not conclusive : on one side , shear - enhanced crystallization has been reported for experiments  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "a suppression of nucleation has been observed experimentally  @xcite and numerically  @xcite .",
    "others report an optimal strain rate for crystallization in supersaturated hard - sphere - like suspensions  @xcite and protein solutions  @xcite .",
    "an optimal strain rate has also been reported in two dimensions for numerical simulations of yukawa - type  @xcite , ising  @xcite , and depletion - driven attractive  @xcite systems , and in a three - dimensional model glass  @xcite .",
    "colloidal systems have the advantage that both the spatial and temporal evolution can be monitored directly in experiments via light scattering  @xcite , or in real space via confocal microscopy  @xcite , see also ref .   for a review .",
    "moreover , the interaction potential between colloidal particles can be tuned  @xcite . in the limit of perfect hard - spheres ,",
    "the crystallization process is driven solely by entropy and the phase diagram depends on the density only . for repulsive interactions , temperature plays a role ; the density is , however , still the dominant control parameter . for a numerical treatment ,",
    "molecular dynamics as well as brownian dynamics simulations appear to be ideally suited to track the temporal development of crystalline nuclei since particle coordinates are accessible and arbitrary interaction potentials can be used .",
    "however , since nucleation is hampered by a large free - energy barrier , it is a rare event .",
    "depending on the height of the barrier , sampling such events can range from difficult to prohibitive unless specifically tailored methods are employed .",
    "such methods include transition path sampling  @xcite , forward flux sampling  @xcite , and umbrella sampling  @xcite .    in this work , we present numerical results for a model colloidal suspension in three dimensions , where particles interact via hard - core exclusion plus a short - ranged yukawa repulsion . the suspension is strongly supersaturated such that the probability for nucleation is shifted into a regime accessible by straightforward methods without making use of importance sampling schemes . here , we employ underdamped langevin dynamics .",
    "although the suspension is strongly supersaturated , we observe that crystallization still proceeds via nucleation and growth . for the densities",
    "studied , small clusters appear and disappear until a cluster reaches the critical size .",
    "the following growth process is dominated by a single large cluster .",
    "we find that the time for this largest cluster to reach a specified size ( larger than the critical size but smaller than the total number of particles ) decreases for small strain rates but strongly increases at larger strain rates .",
    "there is , therefore , an optimal strain rate for the crystallization process .",
    "the reason is that shear flow is responsible for two competing effects : suppression of the initial formation of a critical nucleus and enhancement of its growth once it has formed .",
    "strain rates considered here are so low that shear - induced layering plays no role  @xcite .    for unsheared liquids it has recently been emphasized that nucleation resembles a two - stage process and that pre - structuring of the liquid plays a crucial role in the formation of the critical nucleus  @xcite : droplets of the stable phase appear preferentially in regions of the supersaturated liquid that are still amorphous but where particle have already developed a loose connectivity with their neighbors .",
    "we confirm the two - stage scenario for the model studied here and demonstrate that the main effect of the shear flow is to disrupt the formation of such a pre - structured liquid .",
    "hence , we find that the suppressed nucleation under shear flow has its origin in the inhibition of structuring in the liquid rather than in the `` demolition '' of crystalline clusters",
    ". the enhanced growth rate of sufficiently large clusters can be attributed to either convection or a faster reorganization of the cluster , making it thus easier to incorporate new particles .",

    "[ fig : lc_growth_vs_lc ] . for larger strain rates",
    "the growth rate of small clusters is vanishingly small , whereas already small strain rates significantly speed up the growth process of the crystalline clusters after nucleation .    to gain further insight into the different mechanism ,",
    "we have employed a discrete state model .",
    "the state space of this discrete model comprises the relevant local structural environments of a _ single _ particle .",
    "the microscopic environment of a particle might be fluid or solid .",
    "we further distinguish between the unordered liquid and a pre - structured liquid , which still is amorphous but where already a loose structure between neighbors has formed as determined from a bond criterion .",
    "the solid particles are classified according to their crystal structure as either fcc , bcc , or hcp ; leading to a total of five discrete states . from the simulation data we can measure the populations , i.e. , the fraction of particles that resides in each structure . since the simulations advance from the initial liquid towards the full crystal ,",
    "these populations change over time .",
    "we have found it convenient to calculate conditional averages with respect to the size of the largest cluster .",
    "moreover , we have determined the fluxes between the discrete states , from which we built a transfer matrix .",
    "the quasi - stationary state of this transfer matrix agrees well with the measured actual populations .",
    "nucleation in our model system clearly proceeds from liquid through pre - structured to one of the crystalline structures .",
    "the effect of shear flow is to disrupt the formation of the pre - structured regions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : liq2struc ] .",
    "consequently , there are fewer pre - structured particles and the probability to form a critical nucleus is drastically lowered . on the other hand ,",
    "once a critical droplet of solid particles has formed , the growth rate is enhanced by the shear flow . the emerging functional form   can be explained by convection alone : the flow field constantly changes the vicinity of crystalline clusters and is thus able to enhance the number of liquid particles under the `` influence '' of a crystalline cluster",
    ". however , the shear flow also influences the composition of the cluster , hinting at a second mechanism .",
    "we found that shear flow facilitates transitions towards the bcc structure and thus enhances the fraction of bcc particles in the cluster .",
    "the stable bulk structure is fcc and , therefore , there is a driving force towards fcc .",
    "destabilizing fcc ( or stabilizing bcc ) allows for larger domains of bcc particles without the need to convert bcc , which in turn allows the cluster to grow faster .",
    "our data show that the depth of the minimum in the duration for the crystallization process is much smaller for a lower supersaturation .",
    "this point entails the question whether there is a lower bound on the density below which this minimum vanishes .",
    "how the existence and depth of this minimum depends on the supersaturation remains a topic for future investigation .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to study the influence of hydrodynamic interactions on the crystallization process  @xcite under shear in general , and on the magnitude and the existence of such an optimal strain rate in particular . beyond the insights we could gain for our specific model , we believe that the combination of techniques presented here will prove useful in the study of nucleation and related processes ."
