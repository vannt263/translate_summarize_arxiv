    "to determine the physical parameters of stars and clusters accurately , we should know the correct interstellar reddening .",
    "precise knowledge of @xmath0 is of crucial importance for the determination of distances of reddened stars or clusters .",
    "many investigators determine the total extinction @xmath3 by assuming the total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath0 to be 3.1 . in 1940s , from multicolor photometry of many o and b type stars @xcite concluded that the law of selective absorption is the same for all directions in the galaxy .",
    "later @xcite conducted multi - color photometry of o , b stars and showed that there is no unique reddening law .",
    "in addition , they showed that there is a minor variation of @xmath0 with galactic longitude .",
    "later @xcite confirmed such a variation from the spatial variation of wavelength of maximum polarization .",
    "@xcite presented a functional form of @xmath0 variation against galactic longitude .",
    "recently @xcite showed that the interstellar reddening law @xmath0 is different for different sightlines .",
    "recently @xcite showed that an abnormal reddenig law for the intracluster medium of the young open clusters in the @xmath4 carina nebula .",
    "however they obtained a fairly normal reddening law for the foreground stars . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found a nearly normal reddening law toward the young open cluster ngc 6231 from the optical to mid - ir photometric data .",
    "now it is possible to study the reddening law toward young open clusters in a homogeneous way because the homogeneous near - ir 2mass data as well as mid - ir _ spitzer _ irac images are available for many young open clusters . in this paper",
    "we present a preliminary result from our systematic investigation of the reddening law .",
    "the reddening law for the young open clusters is determined as the same way as the method described in @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic color relations between ( @xmath5)@xmath6 and ( @xmath7)@xmath6 for 2mass @xmath8 bands are presented in @xcite , and those for _ spitzer _",
    "irac bands will be published in the forthcoming paper .",
    "we have analyzed the photometric data for 192 young open clusters with @xmath9 . among them 16 clusters ( e.g. mayer 1 , be 65 , cz 13 , cr 173 , etc ) are either lack of @xmath10 photoelectric or ccd data or ( @xmath11 ) color . and 4 clusters ( e.g. cz 20 , ngc 2453 , etc ) are not young open clusters , 6 clusters ( cr 96 , cr 107 , ngc 2448 , etc ) seem to be not clusters , and 4 clusters ( bh 121 , bh 205 , ic 2948 , and loden 153 ) are parts of the other young clusters .",
    "and therefore we determined the reddening law of 162 young open clusters .",
    "we also determined the color excess ratios in the _ spitzer _ irac bands for 38 clusters .",
    "the @xmath0 of the young open clusters is determined the relation between @xmath0 and color excess ratios by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the color excess ratios for the ob stars in the young open cluster trumpler 16 .",
    "a few foreground b type stars show a fairly normal reddening law of @xmath12 , while cluster ob stars behave abnormally and well match to the solid line of @xmath13 .",
    "although most stars do not show any excess emission in the optical to near - ir , some stars show an evident excess emission in the mid - ir , especially in 8.0 @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we only describe the reddening law of the general interstellar medium .",
    "and therefore we only take the @xmath15 for the young open clusters with an abnormal @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the @xmath17 with respect to galactic longitude .",
    "for some clusters we can not determine the @xmath0 reliably because of small values of reddening or no early type stars in the foreground .",
    "the young open clusters in the sgr - car arm show a relatively high value ( @xmath18 ) , those in the per arm and in the cygnus region have a smaller value ( @xmath19 ) , and those in the mon - cma regions have a nearly normal value ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "in addition the fluctuation of @xmath0 is also noticeable ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "however the overall variation of @xmath0 well follows the equation given by @xcite except for the cma - vel direction .",
    "from the analysis of photometric data for 162 young open clusters we confirmed the large scale variation of the reddening law in the galactic plane , which implies the real variation of dust size distribution in the galactic plane .",
    "we also found a large fluctuation of @xmath0 for a given region .",
    "the cause of this fluctuation is still uncertain , and therefore a systematic photometric survey of open clusters to provide homogeneous photometric data , e.g. the sejong open cluster survey ( sos ) @xcite is required to confirm the real fluctuation .",
