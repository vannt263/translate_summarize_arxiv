    "recently , much attention has been paid to quantum photolithography @xcite due to the possibility of beating the classical rayleigh diffraction limit through using on quantum entanglement between two used light beams .",
    "optical lithography is a widely used printing method which has been the primary tool of the semiconductor industry for transferring circuit images onto substrates to produce smaller and smaller processors . in this process , light is used to etch a substrate and the exposed or unexposed areas on the substrate define patterns .",
    "the resolution of images transferred by using classical light beams is restricted to the rayleigh diffraction limit @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the wavelength of the light , hence one can achieve a resolution only comparable to the wave length of the light used in classical optical lithography @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , agedi and coworkers introduced a procedure called quantum lithography in one dimension that predicts an increase in resolution beyond the diffraction limit due to quantum entanglement between two light beams , and demonstrate a quantum lithography method to improve the resolution by a factor @xmath0 in contrast to classical one , using @xmath0-photon maximal entangled state ( mes ) @xcite .",
    "the maryland group @xcite completed a proof - of - principle experimental demonstration of quantum lithography by using two - photon entangled state generated via a specially designed spontaneous parametric down - conversion .",
    "the increase in resolution makes quantum lithography a potentially useful tool to produce smaller computer chips in nanotechnology .",
    "then the one - dimensional quantum lithography method was generalized to the two - dimensional case @xcite and entangled binomial states @xcite .",
    "since the number of elements writable on a surface scales inverse quadratically with the minimum feature dimension , this improvement is an important advance . the purpose of the present paper is to generalize the mes quantum lithography to the case where two light beams share a @xmath0-photon nonmaximally - entangled state ( nmes ) , and investigate properties of the deposition rate for general patterns in one dimension .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the nmes quantum lithography method after briefly recalling the mes quantum lithography method . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss pattern engineering in one dimension . finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "the quantum photolithographic process is based on the multi - photon absorption process on a substrate .",
    "the character parameter of the optical lithography is the minimal resolvable feature size which , according to rayleigh criterion , occurs at a spacing corresponding to the distance between an intensity maximum and an adjacent intensity minimum @xcite , or optical resolution which may denote the minimal distance between two nearby points that can still be resolved with microscopy or the minimal distance separating two points that are printed using lithography . for a @xmath0-photon state",
    "@xmath3 the resolution is determined by the absorption rate at the imagine surface which is proportional the expectation value of the dosing operator @xmath4 where the dosing operator is defined by @xmath5 with the superposition mode operator @xmath6 and its adjoint @xmath7 .",
    "if a substrate is exposed for a time @xmath8 to the light source , the exposure function @xmath9 gives an exposure pattern .    before going into the nmes lithography ,",
    "let us briefly review the mes quantum lithography presented in ref @xcite . consider two counterpropagating light beams @xmath10 and @xmath11 cross each other at the surface of a photosensitive substrate .",
    "they have a relative phase difference @xmath12 with the optical wave number @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the lateral dimension on the substrate to describe the position where the two beams meet . for the @xmath0-photon maximally - entangled number state of the two light beams @xmath15 ) and ( [ 2 ] ) one can get the following deposition rate @xmath16 which indicates that a @xmath17 shift of @xmath18 will displace @xmath0 times .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-photon mes ( [ 1 ] ) produces an effective rayleigh resolution given by @xmath19 which increases the resolution by a factor @xmath0 in contrast to the classical diffraction limit @xmath20 .",
    "now we consider the quantum lithography with a @xmath0-photon nmes given by @xmath21 measures the entanglement of the state , it changes from @xmath22 ( no entanglement ) to @xmath23 ( maximal entanglement ) .    for the @xmath0-photon nmes ( [ 6 ] ) , from eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) we obtain the following deposition rate @xmath24.\\ ] ]    in what follows , we consider the influence of quantum entanglement for the two cases of nonlocal and local entanglement , respectively",
    ".    * case 1 . *",
    "_ nonlocal entanglement_. in this case , the entangling angle of the two light beams @xmath25 is independent of the position where the two beams meet , then @xmath25 is irrelevant to the phase difference @xmath18 in the nmes ( [ 6 ] ) . from the expression of the deposition rate ( [ 7 ] )",
    "we can see that the amplitude of the deposition function increases with the degree of entanglement .",
    "hence one can manipulate and control the amplitude of the deposition rate through varying the quantum entanglement between the two light beams .",
    "* _ local entanglement_. in this case , the entangling angle of the two light beams @xmath25 is dependent of the position where the two beams meet , then @xmath25 is relevant to the phase difference @xmath18 in the nmes ( [ 6 ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) we can see that this type of phase relevance , which is induced by the local entanglement , affects the period of the deposition function .",
    "it is the period of the deposition function that determines the resolution of the quantum photolithography .",
    "hence , the local entanglement between the two light beams can improve the resolution .",
    "in particular , if we suppose that the entanglement angle changes with variation of the phase @xmath18 according to the resonant relation @xmath26 with @xmath27 being positive integers , then the deposition function ( [ 7 ] ) becomes @xmath28,\\ ] ] which leads to the following resolution @xmath29 which indicates that resonant change of the entanglement angle of the @xmath0-photon nmes enhances the resolution by a factor in contrast to the case of the @xmath0-photon mes .",
    "therefore , one can improve the resolution through resonantly changing the entanglement angle of the @xmath0-photon nmes .    in optical lithography ,",
    "one usually wishes that produced patterns are uniform .",
    "however , the second and third terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) have different periods with respect to the phase @xmath18 . in general superpositions of periodic functions with different modulation periods",
    "produces so - called collapse - and - revival phenomena which appear in laser - atom interactions @xcite .",
    "these collapses and revivals produce are non - uniform patterns .",
    "this non - uniform pattern problems can be removed through choosing specific values of @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "if we set @xmath30 , the deposition function becomes @xmath31,\\ ] ] which leads to the following resolution @xmath32 which implies that uniform patterns can be produced and the resolution is doubled with respect to the mes quantum lithography .",
    "in this section , we show how to manipulate and control patterns in one dimension using the @xmath0-photon nmes and superposition principle in quantum mechanics . in order to engineer arbitrary one - dimensional paterns , we consider a more general @xmath0-photon nmes @xmath33 which is an extension of the @xmath0-photon nmes given by eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and reduces to eq . ( [ 6 ] ) when @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in order to obtain the deposition rate corresponding to the @xmath0-photon nmes ( [ 10 ] ) , we have to calculate the matrix elements of the dosing operator @xmath36 which is given by @xmath37 \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the symbol @xmath38 .    then the expectation value of the dosing operator with respect to the general @xmath0-photon nmes ( [ 10 ] )",

    "one important point to be emphasized is that based on the @xmath0-photon nmes ( [ 10 ] ) one can design various types of patterns on a substrate through building various different kinds of superposition states of the @xmath0-photon nmes ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "we here consider the pseudo - fourier method @xcite where one uses a general superposition state with different photon numbers @xmath43 and a fixed distribution @xmath44 over two modes @xmath45 where the basic state @xmath46 is defined by ( [ 10 ] ) through replacing @xmath0 with @xmath43,it is a @xmath43-photon nmes , and @xmath47 is an arbitrary coefficients .",
    "hence , the state @xmath46 is a superposition state of states with different total photon numbers in each branch .    since @xmath48^{\\dagger}=\\langle\\phi_{n}|(\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}+\\hat{b}^{\\dagger})^n$ ]",
    ", branches with different photon numbers @xmath43 and @xmath49 do not exhibit interference when we calculate the @xmath0-photon deposition rate of the superposition state ( [ 15 ] ) which can be written as @xmath50    -type pattern on the substrate resulting from a superposition of states with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the solid curve is the simulated pattern of the test function @xmath53 . here",
    "the phase difference is in units of @xmath54.,width=321,height=257 ]    0.2 cm    making use of eqs .",

    "( [ 13 ] ) with replacing @xmath0 by @xmath43 .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) implies that the deposition rate of the superposition state ( [ 15 ] ) depends on only the module of the superposition coefficients @xmath47 , and it is independent of the phase of @xmath47 .    using the expression of exposure pattern @xmath57 , from eqs .",

    "( [ 18 ] ) it is easy to understand the role of quantum entanglement in quantum photolithography .",
    "in fact , from eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) we can see that varying of the entanglement angle @xmath25 is equivalent to rescaling time parameter @xmath8 or / and the module of the superposition coefficient @xmath59 for the case of nonlocal entanglement where the entanglement angle @xmath25 is independent of the associated phase difference @xmath18 .",

    "( [ 20 ] ) , ( [ 21 ] ) , and ( [ 22 ] ) we can see that quantum entanglement between two light beams dos not change the background penalty exposure rate but it controls the amplitudes of all fourier components .",
    "it is well known that any sufficiently well - behaved periodic function can be written as an infinite fourier series . however ,",
    "when we create patterns with the pseudo - fourier lithography method , we do not have access to every component of the fourier expansion , since this would involve an infinite number of photons .",
    "this means that we can only employ truncated fourier series , and these can merely approximate arbitrary patterns .",
    "the fourier expansion has the nice property that when a series is truncated at @xmath0 , the remaining terms still give the best fourier expansion of the function up to @xmath0 . in other words ,",
    "the coefficients of a truncated fourier series are equal to the first @xmath0 coefficients of a full fourier series .    as an example , in what follows we use the pseudo - fourier method to simulate a pattern generated by the following test function @xmath67 which can be expanded as a fourier series @xmath68    comparing eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) with ( [ 20 ] ) and using ( [ 22 ] ) we find the subsidiary phase @xmath69 and the superposition coefficients @xmath47 in eqs .",

    "( [ 23 ] ) . and from ( [ 25 ] ) , ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] )",
    "we can see that the superposition state consists of even - number - photon nmes like ( [ 10 ] ) , and only the module of the superposition coefficients affect the deposition rate of quantum photolithography . in figure 1 we have simulated the test pattern ( [ 23 ] ) by using the superposition state given by eq .",
