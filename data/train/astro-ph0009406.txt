    "the evidence that supermassive black - holes are ubiquitous in nearby inactive galaxies is now extremely strong ( eg . van der marel 1999 , kormendy &  richstone 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , several studies have concluded that the masses of these dormant black - holes are directly proportional to the mass of the galaxy bulge ( spheroidal ) component ( eg . kormendy &  richstone 1995 , magorrian et al .",
    "although a significant scatter is present in the correlation ( @xmath5 dex at a given bulge mass ) , the data appear to suggest that @xmath6 .",
    "while studies of nearby inactive galaxies have seen a reasonably coherent picture emerge , the situation with regard to active galaxies is less certain .",
    "although the black - hole mass relation observed in nearby inactive galaxies can be comfortably reproduced by combined galaxy+quasar formation models ( eg . wilman , fabian &  nulsen 2000 , kauffmann &  haehnelt 2000 ) , observational studies to investigate the form of the @xmath1 relation in active galaxies have led to seemingly contradictory results .    in a study of the @xmath1 relation in quasars , laor ( 1998 ) used the fwhm of the broad @xmath0 emission line , together with a calibration between the broad - line region ( blr ) radius and quasar uv luminosity , to obtain virial black - hole mass estimates for 14 pg quasars . using estimates of the host - galaxy bulge luminosities from the hst study of bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , laor found a @xmath7 correlation which agreed reasonably well with the results of magorrian et al .",
    "in contrast , wandel ( 1999 ) found that virial black - hole mass estimates for a sample of 17 seyfert1 galaxies , based on the @xmath0 fwhm and reverberation mapping measurements of the blr radius , were substantially smaller than would be expected from the @xmath1 relation seen in nearby inactive galaxies . using estimates of the seyfert galaxy bulge luminosities from the empirical morphology - based formula of simien &  de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) ,",
    "wandel found that @xmath8 , a factor of between ten and twenty lower than found for both nearby inactive galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) and for luminous quasars ( laor 1998 ) .",
    "the implication of the wandel ( 1999 ) result is that there exists a difference in the formation or triggering mechanism at work in seyfert galaxies and quasars .",
    "this possibility is explored by wang , biermann &  wandel ( 2000 ) who present a model in which @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the velocity dispersion of the accreting gas . in this model",
    "the high values of @xmath11 found in quasars and nearby bulges are the asymptotic , high - velocity case , possibly produced by a violent merger event . in contrast , the much lower ratios found in seyfert galaxies are the result of the accretion of lower velocity gas triggered by tidal disruption .    in this paper the @xmath1 relation is examined over a wide range in agn luminosity by combining new results for a sample of 30 luminous ( m@xmath12 ) quasars with a re - analysis of the bulge masses attributed to the wandel ( 1999 ) seyfert galaxy sample .",
    "first , in section 2 we briefly review the complications and potential uncertainties in deriving black - hole mass estimates from emission - line widths , and explore how best to model the geometry of the broad - line region for the purpose of black - hole estimation in agn .",
    "next , in section 3 we describe the sample of objects selected for study , present the new spectroscopic observations , and explain how reliable bulge luminosities have been extracted from existing hst images . in section",
    "[ main ] three important questions are addressed .",
    "firstly , do powerful agn actually display a @xmath1 correlation consistent with that found in nearby inactive galaxies ?",
    "secondly , do the apparent differences between seyfert galaxies and quasars actually stem from fundamental differences between the two agn classes , or simply from systematic errors in estimating seyfert bulge luminosities ? and finally , do differences in black - hole mass and gas accretion rates play a crucial role in determining the radio properties of agn ? in section [ fp ] stellar velocity estimates for a sub - sample of the quasars are used to compare our virial @xmath0 black - hole mass estimates with those of the @xmath2 relations discovered by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and merritt &  ferrarese ( 2000 ) .",
    "finally , our main conclusions are summarized in section 6 . unless otherwise specified all cosmological calculations performed in this paper assume @xmath13 kms@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , q@xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the basic theory of obtaining virial black - hole mass estimates from quasar emission lines has been discussed extensively in the literature ( eg . wandel , peterson &  malkan 1999 ) and consequently only a brief outline is provided here .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the broad emission lines are produced by material which is gravitationally bound and orbiting with keplerian velocities . if this assumption is applicable then an estimate of the central mass is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the radius of the blr and v is the velocity of the line - emitting material .",
    "there are two standard methods of estimating the radius of the broad - line region .",
    "the first of these , and presumably the more accurate , is to use the time delay between continuum and line variations . for the sample of seyfert galaxies studied by wandel , peterson &  malkan ( 1999 ) and wandel ( 1999 ) ,",
    "long - term monitoring has provided such reverberation mapping estimates of the radius of the broad - line region . in the absence of reverberation mapping data for the quasar sample",
    "it is necessary to use a more indirect estimate of the broad - line radius .",
    "the method used here is the correlation between @xmath18 and monochromatic luminosity at @xmath19 found by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , from their reverberation mapping results for 17 pg quasars . when converted to the cosmology adopted in this paper , the kaspi et al .",
    "correlation becomes : @xmath20    the other necessary component for the virial mass estimate is a measure of velocity of the line emitting material . to obtain this , wandel ( 1999 )",
    "adopted the assumption of random orbits , in which case v @xmath21 fwhm .",
    "however , the assumption of random orbits seems unrealistic for quasars . in particular , for radio - loud quasars where the radio core : lobe ratio provides an independent measure of orientation , there exists strong evidence that the velocity - field of the broad - line region is better represented by a combination of a random isotropic component , with characteristic velocity @xmath22 , and a component only in the plane of the disk , with characteristic velocity @xmath23 ( wills & browne 1986 ) .    in this case",
    ", the observed fwhm will be given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angle between the disc normal , and the line of sight to the observer .",
    "in the case of radio - quiet objects we have no guide as to what precise value of @xmath25 should be adopted for a particular object .",
    "however , attempts to unify radio - loud quasars and galaxies ( e.g. barthel 1989 ) , and imaging polarimetry studies of radio - quiet agn ( e.g. antonucci &  miller 1985 ) support a picture in which an active nucleus is likely to appear to the observer as a quasar provided @xmath26 .    in order to test the viability of this disc - model we have attempted to reproduce the form of the cumulative fwhm distribution of the combined quasar+seyfert sample . as can be seen from fig 1b . , the cumulative distribution of the data is convex in shape .",
    "this form of distribution can not in fact be produced by a single disc model in which the angle between the disc normal and observer s line of sight is assumed to be randomly distributed between @xmath27 and some adopted upper limit @xmath28 .",
    "the reason for this is simply that , given a random distribution of theta ( and @xmath23 significantly larger than @xmath22 ) the cumulative distribution of fwhm grows proportional to solid angle @xmath29 .",
    "however , we have found that the form of the observed distribution can in fact be almost perfectly reproduced by a model which includes only one additional free parameter .",
    "specifically we have relaxed the assumption of a purely random distribution of theta for @xmath30 by exploring whether the data can be described by a combination of two randomly - oriented disc - model populations with the same characteristic orbital velocity but different angular constraints .",
    "the best - fitting model parameters were found to be @xmath31 km@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , with the two models contributing @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the combined model distribution respectively . in both cases",
    "the model agn are assumed to lie randomly at angles between @xmath37 to the line of sight .",
    "although two - component disc - models with non - zero random velocity components and independent orbital velocity components were considered , it was found that the introduction of these extra free parameters did not produce significantly improved fits .",
    "the best - fitting model distribution is shown as the thin line in fig 1b . and can be seen to be an excellent representation of the data , with an application of the kolmogorov - smirnov test showing the two distributions to be indistinguishable ( @xmath38 ) . by substituting the fitted model parameters into eqn 2 .",
    "it is now possible to determine the average relationship between observed fwhm and actual orbital velocity @xmath23 by calculating @xmath39 as weighted by solid angle .",
    "we therefore find that on average @xmath40 fwhm , and it is this relation which is adopted throughout the remainder of this paper .    as can be seen from the best - fitting parameters presented above , the dominant population of objects in this two - component disc model of the blr is constrained to lie within @xmath41 to the line of sight , as expected in the unified model ( eg .",
    "barthel 1989 ) .",
    "in contrast , the second population of objects is required to lie within a smaller range of angles to the line of sight than is normally assumed in the unified model ( ie.@xmath42 ) .",
    "however , one can argue that this is entirely reasonable given that the present sample is largely dominated by powerful , optically - selected broad - line agn .",
    "however , it is worth noting the implications of the assumptions in this simple model , and the effect of relaxing them . due to the fact that the virial black - hole mass estimate is proportional to @xmath43",
    ", the adoption of the standard model in which blr velocities are purely random ( @xmath44fwhm ) leads to black hole mass estimates three times _ smaller _ than derived in this paper .",
    "further evidence in support of the appropriateness of the blr model adopted here is discussed in section 4.1 and section 5 .",
    "the sample of 30 luminous quasars ( m@xmath12 ) studied in this paper consists of two optically - matched sub - samples of 17 radio - quiet quasars and 13 radio - loud quasars .",
    "the unique feature of this sample is that all of its members have accurate bulge luminosities available from detailed two - dimensional modelling of hst images .",
    "nineteen of the objects are taken from the sample studied by mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and dunlop et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , with a further eleven taken from the sample of bahcall et al .",
    "this is therefore the best dataset currently available for this type of investigation .",
    "the sample of seyfert galaxies consists of fifteen of the seventeen objects studied by wandel ( 1999 ) .",
    "the two objects which are not included , akn 120 &  mrk 110 , have been excluded on the basis that no suitable hst archive data exists for these objects , and that a reliable disc / bulge decomposition could not be identified in the literature .",
    "the new observations presented in this paper consist of nuclear spectra of 13 of the quasar sample which were obtained in december 1999 on the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope on la palma . all observations used the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) with the 235 mm camera and the eev10 @xmath45 pixel ccd as the detector .",
    "integration times on individual objects were @xmath46 seconds , with the rv300 grating providing spectra centred on @xmath47 with a resolution of @xmath48 . at the average redshift of the quasar sample ( @xmath49 )",
    "this ensured that the spectra were always approximately centred on the h@xmath50 line , with the wavelength coverage of @xmath51 allowing an accurate continuum determination .",
    "the reduction of the spectra was performed in iraf in the standard way , including flux calibration , and correction for atmospheric extinction and galactic reddening .",
    "the final wavelength calibrated spectra were interpolated onto a linear dispersion of 1.5 / pix and are shown in fig [ spectra ] .",
    "the h@xmath50 fwhm measurements for 16/17 of the remaining quasars in the sample are taken from the boroson &  green ( 1992 ) and corbin ( 1997 ) studies .",
    "given that the h@xmath50 fwhm enters into the virial mass estimate quadratically , it is obviously important that there is no large systematic offset between the two sets of spectra . fortunately , five of the quasars for which new spectra have been obtained also feature in the boroson &  green study . for these five objects the fwhm values determined from the new spectra agree well with those of boroson & green , @xmath52 , providing confidence that large variations in measured fwhm values do not introduce large systematic errors into the virial black - hole estimates . the @xmath0 fwhm measurement for one final object , 1635 + 119 ,",
    "is taken from the spectrum of wills &  browne ( 1986 ) .",
    "a substantial effort has been invested in providing accurate estimates of the bulge luminosities for all the objects included in this study .",
    "all 30 objects in the quasar sample have bulge luminosities derived from two - dimensional modelling of hst data from the deep host - galaxy imaging studies of dunlop et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and bahcall et al .",
    "the addition of the dunlop et al .",
    "( 2000 ) host - galaxy sample means that the number of quasars with reliable bulge luminosities is a factor of two greater than was available to laor ( 1998 ) .    of equal importance to this study",
    "are revised estimates of the bulge luminosities within the seyfert galaxy sample .",
    "the bulge luminosities used by wandel ( 1999 ) were taken from whittle ( 1992 ) and are based upon an application of the simien &  de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) formula relating bulge / disc ratio to galaxy morphology . as well as the large amount of scatter associated with this empirical formula , it is not clear that it is directly applicable to seyfert galaxies . indeed ,",
    "if a typical early - type colour of @xmath53 is assumed , then the bulge magnitudes adopted by wandel correspond to an average of @xmath54 , half a magnitude brighter than the recent determination of @xmath55 by lin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in light of this",
    "it seems at least plausible that overestimation of the seyfert galaxy bulge luminosities may contribute to the lower @xmath11 ratios found by wandel ( 1999 ) .    in order to properly quantify the extent to which such overestimates of the seyfert bulge luminosities",
    "can explain the wandel ( 1999 ) result , it is important to obtain bulge luminosity estimates of comparable quality to those of the quasar sample .",
    "suitable quality hst archive data is available for 9/15 of the seyfert galaxies , predominantly from the large - scale seyfert galaxy imaging study of malkan , gorjian & tam ( 1998 ) .",
    "the images of these objects were decomposed into disc and bulge components in an identical fashion to that utilised in the quasar host study of dunlop et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and details of the modelling technique used can be found in mclure , dunlop &  kukula ( 2000 ) .",
    "the remaining six seyfert galaxies have bulge luminosity estimates taken from the disc / bulge decompositions of baggett , baggett &  anderson ( 1998 ) and kotilainen , ward & williger ( 1993 ) .",
    "although determined from ground - based data , these published bulge luminosities are still expected to be more accurate than a morphology based estimate .",
    "the best estimates of the bulge luminosities for the quasar and seyfert samples are listed in tables [ big ] & [ small ] respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the black - hole mass vs. bulge luminosity relation for the combined quasar and seyfert galaxy sample is plotted in fig [ mainfig ] .",
    "the two quantities can be seen to be well correlated , with the rank - order coefficient of @xmath56 having a significance of @xmath57 . in order to obtain a reliable fit to the relation ,",
    "a @xmath58 minimization was used which properly accounts for the uncertainties in both the estimated black - hole masses and bulge luminosities ( press et al .",
    "the best - fitting relation ( @xmath59 for 45 d.o.f . ) is found to be : @xmath60 and is shown as the solid line in the left - hand panel of fig [ mainfig ] . in terms of black - hole mass",
    "the scatter around the best - fitting relation of @xmath61 is large ( see fig [ scatter ] ) , although still comparable to that found by both magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and laor ( 1998 ) .",
    "in contrast to the findings of wandel ( 1999 ) there is no evidence from fig [ mainfig ] that the seyfert galaxy @xmath62 relation is different to that of quasars .",
    "the removal of this discrepancy is due to the improved estimates of the seyfert galaxy bulge luminosities use here . as mentioned in section [ bulge ] ,",
    "it was suspected _ a priori _ that the bulge luminosities adopted by wandel ( 1999 ) were probably overestimated .",
    "this suspicion is supported by the mean bulge luminosity derived for the seyfert galaxies here , m@xmath63 , which is 1.3 magnitudes fainter than estimated by wandel ( 1999 ) .",
    "it appears therefore that the evidence from this data - set supports a straightforward unification of seyfert galaxies and quasars in which black - hole mass scales with bulge luminosity . in this scenario",
    "fig [ mainfig ] suggests that a black - hole mass of @xmath64 needed to power a luminous quasar requires a host galaxy with a bulge luminosity of m@xmath65 .",
    "this restriction naturally predicts that the hosts of luminous quasars will be predominantly massive early - type galaxies , in good agreement with the findings of recent studies ( eg .",
    "mclure et al . 1999 ,",
    "dunlop et al .",
    "2000 , boyce et al .",
    "1998 ) .      by combining bulge luminosity with a suitable mass - to - light ratio it is possible to test whether or not the observed @xmath7 relation is consistent with a simple linear scaling between black - hole and bulge mass .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio adopted here is the @xmath66 relation determined by j@xmath67rgensen , franx &  kj@xmath68rgaard ( 1996 ) , hereafter jfk96 , from their gunn-@xmath69 fundamental plane study . under the assumption that @xmath70 , the @xmath7 relation is expected to have the form : @xmath71 where the constant @xmath72 results from assuming an average bulge colour of @xmath73 ( fukugita et al .",
    "1995 ) and an absolute gunn-@xmath69 magnitude for the sun of @xmath74 ( j@xmath67rgensen 1994 ) . a relation of this form , with a value of @xmath75 as determined by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , is shown as the solid line in the right - hand panel of fig [ mainfig ] .",
    "it can be seen that , for a given bulge luminosity adopting the magorrian et al .",
    "normalization predicts black - hole masses approximately 2.5 times larger than determined via the @xmath0 fwhm .",
    "it is also noteworthy however that the slope of @xmath76 expected from a linear @xmath1 relation is not inconsistent with the best - fitting value of @xmath77 determined above .",
    "consequently , a least - squares fit of the data was undertaken with an enforced slope of @xmath76 , and is shown as the dashed line in the right - hand panel of fig [ mainfig ] .",
    "this can be seen to be a reasonable representation of the data , suggesting that the scaling between black - hole and bulge mass is consistent with being linear .",
    "the least - squares fit with an enforced slope of @xmath76 has a intercept of @xmath78 which , when compared with equ [ predict ] , suggests that the constant of proportionality between black - hole and bulge mass is @xmath79 .",
    "it is worth emphasising that this value for the constant of proportionality results , at least in part , from our use of a simple , but realistic disc - like model for the blr , incorporating the known orientation biases of optically luminous agn .",
    "if instead one simply uses the random orbit relation @xmath80fwhm , then as discussed in section 2 , the inferred black - hole masses would be @xmath81 times smaller , yielding the relation @xmath82 .",
    "this is the origin of the findings of ho ( 1999 ) who studied the @xmath7 relation in a sample 16 seyfert galaxies ( 12 of which are common to the sample studied here ) using published @xmath83-band photometry and virial black - hole mass estimates from reverberation mapping and @xmath0 fwhm measurements .",
    "ho found that the reverberation mapping black - hole estimates were lower than expected from the @xmath7 relation , suggesting a value of @xmath84 .",
    "further evidence that simple random - orbit calculations for the blr lead to systematic underestimation of black - hole mass is discussed in section 5 .",
    "fig [ lion ] shows the correlation between bulge luminosity and continuum ionizing luminosity for the full sample , where we have adopted the relation @xmath85 which was found to be the average of a large scatter by wandel , peterson &  malkan ( 1999 ) .",
    "these two quantities are well correlated ( @xmath86 ) , in apparent agreement with the results of the combined seyfert galaxy and quasar study of mcleod &  rieke ( 1995 ) .",
    "mcleod &  rieke found a relation between @xmath87-band host luminosity and @xmath83-band nuclear luminosity in the form of a lower limit , such that @xmath88(host)@xmath89(nucleus ) .",
    "however , it is also noticeable from fig [ lion ] that the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 is entirely dependent upon the low luminosity seyfert galaxies , with the quasar sample on its own displaying no significant correlation , @xmath92 .",
    "the conclusion that the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 breaks down at higher nuclear luminosities is supported by the results of a study of high - luminosity quasars by percival et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . although including quasars up to a factor of ten more luminous than those studied here , percival et al .",
    "find very similar host galaxy luminosities .",
    "the suggestion is therefore that high luminosity quasars operate at higher accretion rates , rather than harbouring significantly more massive black - holes .",
    "the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 amongst the seyfert galaxies raises the possibility that the observed correlation between @xmath93 and @xmath91 could in fact be simply due to independent correlations with @xmath90 . in order to investigate this possibility",
    "the partial spearman rank correlation test ( macklin 1982 ) has been used to quantify the correlation between @xmath93 and @xmath91 , independent of @xmath90 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath93 and @xmath91 at constant @xmath90 has a coefficient of @xmath94 which has a significance of @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , although the @xmath93 and @xmath91 correlation is still clearly present , its significance is substantially lowered .",
    "unfortunately , due to the heterogeneous nature of the sample of seyfert galaxies which currently have reverberation mapping data available , it is difficult to quantify properly the significance of the @xmath7 relation . in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "a substantially larger sample of agn is required , selected from a narrow slice in both nuclear luminosity and redshift .",
    "the black - hole mass estimates for the 17 radio - quiet and 13 radio - loud quasars studied here provide an opportunity to determine the influence ( if any ) of black - hole mass on quasar radio luminosity .",
    "the ionizing continuum luminosity distributions of the two quasar sub - samples are indistinguishable , with a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test returning a probability of @xmath96 that both sub - samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "consequently , any difference in the distribution of black - hole masses between the two sub - samples is presumably linked to the difference in radio properties .    with the results of section [ linear ] showing that agn black - hole and bulge masses are consistent with being directly proportional , it is expected that the @xmath97 magnitude difference in median bulge luminosity between the quasar sub - samples should translate directly into a corresponding difference in average black - hole mass .",
    "this is indeed the case , with the median black - hole mass of the radio - loud sub - sample a factor of three larger than that of the radio - quiet sub - sample .",
    "a natural division between the quasar sub - samples appears to occur at @xmath98 .",
    "only 2/13 of the radio - loud quasars have @xmath99 , while only 4/17 of the radio - quiet have @xmath100 .",
    "this difference in black - hole mass distributions is shown to be significant at the @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) level by a ks test .",
    "the implication from the quasar sample is therefore that ( albeit with substantial overlap ) for a given nuclear luminosity , the probability of a source being radio - loud increases with black - hole mass , or alternately decreases with @xmath103 .",
    "fig [ ledd ] shows a plot of estimated ionizing luminosity vs. black - hole mass , together with lines indicating the location of objects radiating at 100% , 10% and 1% of the eddington limit .",
    "two aspects of this figure are noteworthy .",
    "firstly , it can be seen that the vast majority of the objects appear to be radiating in the range @xmath104 of the eddington limit , with a mean value of @xmath105 .",
    "this is despite the fact that the sample spans a range in ionizing luminosity of four orders of magnitude , and is in contrast to the results of wandel , peterson & malkan ( 1999 ) and kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who both find that the @xmath106 ratio increases weakly with continuum luminosity .",
    "secondly , there appears to be no evidence that the seyfert galaxies are operating in a different accretion regime to the quasars , contrary to the finding of lu & yu ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , it should also perhaps be noted that differences between the uv spectra of seyfert galaxies and quasars could well mean that a global correction of the form @xmath107 is inappropriate .",
    "in this section the possibility of calibrating the virial @xmath0 fwhm black - hole estimates , by taking advantage of the remarkably small scatter in the recently discovered @xmath2 correlation , is explored . considering that @xmath0 fwhm measurements can be obtained with relative ease for powerful agn , in comparison with determining the host - galaxy stellar velocity dispersion , this is a question of some interest .",
    "although stellar velocity measurements are not available for the quasar sample , a comparison is still possible for the 19 objects which are taken from the host - galaxy study of mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and dunlop et al .",
    "one of the main successes of this study was the first demonstration that the massive elliptical host galaxies of these quasars follow an identical kormendy relation ( @xmath109 ) to normal inactive ellipticals .",
    "therefore , because the kormendy relation is simply a projection of the fundamental plane that elliptical galaxies occupy in the three dimensional space defined by @xmath110 , it is possible to use the @xmath111 &  @xmath112 data for these objects to estimate their stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "the fundamental plane parameters adopted here are those determined for the coma cluster by jfk96 : @xmath113 although there is evidence that the form of the fundamental plane changes with redshift , the form of this evolution ( @xmath114 ; j@xmath67rgensen et al .",
    "1999 ) should not introduce significant errors at the average redshift of the quasar sample ( @xmath115 ) .    due to the disagreement over what the correct form of the @xmath2 relation is , both the @xmath116 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ) and @xmath117 ( merritt &  ferrarese 2000 ) versions of the relation have been used to convert the velocity dispersion estimates into black - hole masses . in both cases",
    "the @xmath2 relations predict black - hole masses which are in remarkably good agreement with our virial @xmath0 estimates , with median @xmath118 ratios of 1.04 & 1.31 for the gebhardt et al . and merritt &  ferrarese relations respectively",
    ". the clear implication of this comparison is that the use of a disc - like blr , combined with limits of disc orientation relative to the observer , has led to reliable virial @xmath0 fwhm estimates of black - hole mass .",
    "in contrast , the standard assumption of purely random blr velocities lead to virial @xmath0 fwhm black - hole mass estimates which appear to be systematically low by a factor of @xmath119 .",
    "a similar systematic problem with the assumption of random orbits was alluded to by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000b ) when they compared ( random orbit ) virial black - hole mass estimates , based on reverberation mapping and @xmath0 fwhm measurements , with velocity dispersion black - hole masses for a sample of seven seyfert galaxies ( five of which are common to the sample studied here ) .",
    "although gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000b ) concluded that the discrepancy between the two black - hole mass estimates was not significant , they did comment that an increase in the reverberation mapping estimates by a factor of @xmath120 would improve the agreement .",
    "finally , in further support of the relation @xmath121 derived from our @xmath0 fwhm analysis , we note that gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000b ) also comment that new three integral models show that the black - hole masses originally determined by magorrian et al .",

    "the black - hole masses for a sample of 30 optically - matched radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars have been estimated using @xmath0 fwhm and continuum luminosity measurements from new and previously published nuclear spectra .",
    "reliable quasar bulge luminosities have been combined with new and published disc / bulge decompositions for a sample of seyfert galaxies with reverberation mapping black - hole estimates , in order to study the form of the @xmath7 relation over a large baseline in agn luminosity .",
    "the results of the @xmath0 black - holes mass estimates have been compared with the @xmath2 correlation in an attempt to check the normalization of the @xmath1 relation .",
    "the main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "host - galaxy bulge luminosity and black - hole mass are found to be well correlated , albeit with scatter of 0.6 dex in @xmath93 . assuming a simple but realistic disc - like geometry for the blr , coupled with limits on viewing angle for optically - luminous agn , the form of the @xmath124 correlation is shown to be consistent with @xmath3 .",
    "contrary to the results of wandel ( 1999 ) no evidence is found that seyfert galaxies follow a different @xmath7 relation to quasars .",
    "the results presented here suggest that unification of seyfert galaxies and radio - quiet quasars via a simple scaling in black - hole mass is tenable .",
    "a comparison of the virial black - hole estimates based on @xmath0 fwhm measurements with those predicted by the @xmath2 relation suggests that our @xmath0 black - hole estimates are , on average , accurate to within a factor @xmath125 .",
    "these two , completely independent approaches to black - hole mass estimation both support a black - hole mass vs. bulge mass relation of the form @xmath3 .",
    "4 .   the distribution of black - hole masses in the radio - quiet and radio - loud quasar sub - samples are found to be significantly different ( @xmath102 ) , with the median radio - loud black - hole mass a factor of three larger than the equivalent radio - quiet value .",
    "it appears that , for some reason , a radio - loud quasar requires a black - hole mass @xmath126 .",
    "finally , perhaps the most important conclusion resulting from this study is that easily obtainable agn nuclear spectra can be be used to provide black - hole mass estimates which are accurate to within a factor of @xmath127 .",
    "it is therefore possible that large - scale studies of agn black - hole demography can be undertaken without the need for more demanding and time - intensive stellar velocity dispersion measurements .",
