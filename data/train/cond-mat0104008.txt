    "in this paper we calculate some properties of the helium system using the modifications of helium  helium interatomic potential obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the method of receiving the potential is based on the collective variables formalism as described in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "numerical methods could be grouped in two large parts : 1 )  calculations with adjustable parameters using experimental data on thermodynamic and transport properties  @xcite , 2 )  _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical computations ( mainly monte carlo ) @xcite . a good comparison between various potentials , calculated properties of helium , and the experimental data might be found in  @xcite .",
    "we analyze our potentials due to the form of the potential curve and such properties as the potential energy , the total energy , and the sound velocity , all calculated at @xmath0  k , i.  e. , for the ground state .    concerning the form of the potential curve , one can notice that the short - range part of the potential is not very significant starting from distances about 2   and less .",
    "this statement becomes clear if one looks at the pair distribution function @xmath2 of helium  @xcite : @xmath3 .    on the other hand , the results for the potential from  @xcite lead to the value @xmath4  k for the total energy of the system of helium atoms at 0  k , while the experiment gives @xmath5  k  @xcite , we consider it as a good agreement .",
    "but we obtained the value of the potential energy @xmath6  k , and computer simulations  @xcite predict it in the range from about @xmath7 to @xmath8  k ( there is no experimental measurements available for this quantity ) .",
    "this difference may not seem to be quite satisfactory if one calculates quantities connected with the potential energy only .",
    "thus , we tried to correct our potential for it could reflect the short - range interactions more precisely unlike that obtained in  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we used some modification of the hard sphere potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the calculating procedure is described in the section  2 .",
    "different forms for the short - range repulsion are presented in the section  3 , the respective potential curves are also given there . in the section  4 we adduce the computation of the energy and the sound velocity of 4 in the ground state .",
    "the following relation was used for the calculation of the potential fourier image @xmath9 . see  @xcite : [ firstnu ] & + & * q*^2a_2(*q*)- * q*^2a_2 ^ 2(*q*)-_*k 0 * * k*^2a_4(*k , -k , q , -q * ) + & & + _ * k 0**k(-k - q)*a_3(*q , k ,",
    "-k - q*)=0 , @xmath10 is the total number of particles , @xmath11 is the volume of the system , in the thermodynamic limit we have @xmath12  @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is the mass of 4 atom ; the quantities @xmath15 are expressed through @xmath16 , see  @xcite .",
    "we are going to solve this problem in the approximation of  two sums over the wave vector \" .",
    "such calculations were made in  @xcite with the expression for @xmath16 in the form of a_2(*q*)=12(1 - 1s_q)-12(*q * ) , @xmath17 being complex functional of @xmath16 containing summation ( integration ) over the wave vector  @xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ firstnu ] ) for @xmath9 is solved using iterative procedure .",
    "we have used the corrected expression for the zeroth approximation of the quantity @xmath16",
    "@xcite : a^0_2()=12(1s_q^0 - 1s_q ) , while in  @xcite we used a^0_2()=12(1 - 1s_q ) ; @xmath18 stands for the short - range structure factor , i.  e. it corresponds to the short - range repulsive interactions .",
    "the question obtaining this structure factor @xmath18 is elucidated in the next section .",
    "this leads to @xmath21 , the structure factor of the hard sphere system .",
    "it was calculated from the pair distribution function of the hard sphere system in which we neglected all terms with orders of density higher than 2 .",
    "this approximation will be called here as @xmath22-approximation or hs@xmath22 .",
    "it is known that the percus ",
    "yevick approximation ( py ) gives quite good description in the case of short - range interactions .",
    "it has also another advantage : there is an exact solution of the ornstein ",
    "zernike equation for the hard sphere system in py  @xcite .",
    "we denote the structure factor obtained in this fashion as @xmath23 .",
    "the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 show a weak damping @xmath26 at the large values of the wave vector .",
    "it leads to the complication of the calculation procedure since one should extend the integration limits in the fourier transformation of @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely speaking , the damping of @xmath9 was weak too and we used the extrapolation at large @xmath27 to obtain correct behaviour of @xmath28 at small distances .    we have calculated the fourier image @xmath9 and the potential @xmath28 using the hard sphere structure factor both in hs@xmath22 and py approximations . as one can see from the fig .",
    "[ phihspy ] , the long - range behaviour of this potential is not satisfactory unlike the short - range one .          the true repulsive part of the potential should be a bit `` softened '' .",
    "it is easier to formulate this  softening \" in the terms of meyer function @xmath29 : f(r)=e^-(r)-1 that stays finite while @xmath28 can have infinities , see ( [ phihs ] ) .",
    "let us suppose the power dependence in @xmath19 : @xmath30 .",
    "then the kinetic energy operator in the schrdinger equation gives : -^22m^2r^2e^-(a / r)^n= -^22mn^2r^2(ar)^2ne^-(a / r)^n + o(1/r^n+2 ) .",
    "thus , the power @xmath31 must equal the power of inverse distance in the repulsive part of real potential . assuming it to be the lennard",
    "jones potential we obtain @xmath32 .",
    "another way is to round the corners in the meyer function via direct accepting its form .",
    "for instance , like in the previous case : [ fpow ] f(r)=e^-(a / r)^n-1 .",
    "the value of @xmath33 should be taken large ( larger than 5 ) in order to resemble the hard sphere step .",
    "let us choose the following values for ahs quantities in ( [ fpow ] ) : a=2.1   , n=12 .",
    "the meyer function then becomes quite close to the hard sphere step , see fig .",
    "[ fahs ] . that is the reason why we call it `` almost hard spheres '' .",
    "we have calculated the structure factor of the softened repulsive part using the py approximation . since we do not need big accuracy , only the first iteration in the ornstein ",
    "zernike equation was used .",
    "our results show that the potential curve does not differ much from that of our previous work @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ phissahs ] .    in spite of large difference in @xmath34 powers ( 5 and 12 )",
    ", the results do not yield to much different behaviour in the region of small @xmath35 : it still resembles that of @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the reason must be in principal difference between soft and hard spheres , namely in the analyticity or non - analyticity of meyer function that leads to different types of damping at large @xmath27 for the structure factor and , as a result , for the fourier image @xmath9 .",
    "another fact concerns the region of potential well .",
    "one can see that the increasing of @xmath34 power from 5 to 12 moves the depth of the well closer to that of obtained from the hard sphere approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "similar value was obtained in @xcite and it appears not to differ much from the results of computer simulations @xcite and the computations with adjustable parameters @xcite",
    ". those results might be found in table  1 .",
    "@xmath36)we do not give data for the potential obtained using @xmath37 since in this case one can not obtain a `` good '' @xmath38 : value of @xmath39 is negative for some values of @xmath27 .",
    "+ @xmath40calculation using potential  @xcite",
    ". + @xmath41ref .",
    "[ expdata ] .",
    "+ @xmath42this value corresponds to the sound velocity at saturated vapour pressure for @xmath43  k  @xcite .",
    "[ nist ] gives 237.8  m / s at @xmath44  k. these values are not strictly experimental but it is possible to consider them as the averaged experimental ones since they are calculated using the well - analyzed equation of state .      as might be seen from the table  2 , the hs model for the short - range repulsion yields to incorrect values for energy and the sound velocity .",
    "unfortunately , we did not find the universal potential satisfying the requirements to describe the total energy and the potential energy with similar accuracy .",
    "the best fit for both these quantities is found in the case of `` glued '' potential but the method of its obtaining looks very artificially .",
    "one can see that the best fit of the potential energy is found in the ahs approximation for the short - range repulsion .",
    "on the other hand , previously obtained potential  @xcite remains the best of those considered here due to the values of the total energy and the sound velocity .",
    "therefore , three potential will be used in our further works : the potential obtained in  @xcite , the potential with ahs short - range repulsion , and the `` glued '' potential .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of thermodynamic and transport properties that might be calculated and compared with the experiment or the computer simulations will judge the most suitable model potential ."
