    "deuterium ( d ) is one of the light elements created in the big bang , whose primordial abundance depends sensitively on the cosmological constants @xcite .",
    "d is destroyed by nuclear reactions in stellar interiors , a process termed astration , and its abundance decreases monotonically along with the chemical evolution of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the abundance of d in the present day is thus directly related to the primordial nucleosynthesis and the subsequent galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the d astration factor , defined as the ratio of the primordial to the present - day d to hydrogen ( d / h ) ratio , should reflect the history of the star - formation and the infall of the pristine gas to the galactic disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the observed d / h ratio of the interstellar gas shows no systematic trend with the metallicity , but shows a considerable scatter , which can not be accounted for solely by galactic chemical evolution models @xcite .",
    "@xcite show several pieces of evidence that d is depleted onto dust grains in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which was originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "they show that the d / h ratio of the interstellar gas is well correlated with the depletion of iron and silicon and also with the excitation temperature of molecular hydrogen .",
    "enrichment of d found in interplanetary dust particles @xcite further supports the depletion model of d.    @xcite proposes that interstellar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) can be the major reservoir of interstellar d. pahs are thought to be responsible for a series of the emission bands in the near- to mid - infrared region @xcite , referred to as `` pah features , '' which are ubiquitously observed in the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite shows that the d / h ratio in pahs can be as high as @xmath2 , which is sufficient to account for the observed range of d / h of the interstellar gas , if the gas temperature is lower than 90k .",
    "when h in pahs is replaced by d , the emission bands originating from vibration modes of ch bonds should be shifted to longer wavelengths by a factor of the difference in reduced mass between the ch and cd oscillators .",
    "the emission bands at 3.3 and 3.4@xmath13.5@xmath0 m , which come from stretching vibrations of aromatic and aliphatic ch bonds , are thus expected to move to @xmath3 and @xmath4@xmath14.7@xmath0 m in deuterated pahs ( pads , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite report detection of an emission feature at 4.65@xmath0 m with the 4.4@xmath5 level in m17 based on observations with the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) onboard the _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_. subsequently @xcite report detection of emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65@xmath0 m at 1.9@xmath5 and 4.4@xmath5 levels in the orion bar region with sws observations and attribute them to aromatic and aliphatic stretching vibration modes of cd in pads , respectively .",
    "they estimate the ratio of the sum of the integrated band intensities at 4.4 and 4.65@xmath0 m to those at 3.3 and 3.4@xmath13.5@xmath0 m as @xmath6 in the orion bar and @xmath7 in m17 . while those ratios are in the range of d / h predicted by the depletion model of d onto pahs @xcite , the spectral range 4.08@xmath15.30@xmath0 m of the sws ( band 2a ) has a rather high noise level and similar features are not detected in any other objects .",
    "therefore , it is strongly desirable to obtain spectra with higher signal - to - noise ratios and confirm the detection , particularly for the 4.4@xmath0 m band , giving a better constraint on the d / h ratio in pahs .    the spectral range of 4.3@xmath14.7@xmath0 m is largely obscured by the terrestrial atmosphere and we need space telescopes to observe these pad features .",

    "the nir grism ( ng ) provides a dispersion of 0.0097@xmath0 m per pixel for 2.5@xmath15@xmath0 m and spectroscopy with nh gives a slightly better spectral resolution than that with ns .    in the program ismgn , a number of extended objects in the galactic plane have been observed with nir spectroscopy , including the orion bar and m17 . for both targets , the center of the ns slit",

    "the residual dark signals are estimated from this region and subtracted in the post pipeline process .",
    "this process also corrects for spurious patterns parallel to the spatial direction due to the detector anomaly .",

    "is shifted to 4.24@xmath0 m to avoid possible excess emission around 4.16@xmath0 m .",
    "three pah band components are clearly seen at 3.29 , 3.41 , and 3.48@xmath0 m .",
    "the former two bands have sufficiently broad intrinsic widths compared to the present spectral resolution , while the 3.48@xmath0 m band is known to consist of more than one components , which can not be resolved by the present resolution @xcite .",
    "hence , we approximate the 3.29 and 3.41@xmath0 m bands by lorentzian functions and the 3.48@xmath0 m band by a gaussian in the fitting .",
    "this combination of functions provides the best fit for the 3@xmath0 m emission . the co@xmath13 ice absorption at 4.27@xmath0 m is clearly seen in the m17 spectrum .",
    "the presence of the co@xmath13 ice band also suggests the presence of the broad h@xmath13o ice absorption at around 3@xmath0 m , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but it is not obvious when the absorption is weak and overlaps with the bright pah band emission .",
    "a simple screen geometry , in which the ice species are located in front of the emission source , is assumed in the spectrum fit . for the h@xmath13o ice absorption , we employ laboratory data taken at 10k @xcite , whereas we assume a gaussian profile in absorption for the co@xmath13 ice because of its narrow width @xcite .",
    "details of the fit are given in @xcite , which employ a slightly different method to estimate the continuum .",
    "in the present study , we intend to fit the lower boundary of the spectrum in the estimate of the continuum to obtain an upper limit for the remaining emission .",
    "the best fit indicates the presence of h@xmath13o ice with a column density of @xmath14@xmath15 for the orion bar , which is in the weakest end of the observed range @xcite .",
    "no positive detection of the co@xmath13 ice is obtained for the orion bar .",

    "the column density ratio of @xmath23% is again in the range expected for massive young stellar objects .",
    "the fitted spectra are shown by the red dashed lines in figure  [ fig2 ] .    in the next step",
    "we subtract the estimated continuum , the pah band emission , and the ice absorption from the observed spectrum .",
    "figures  [ fig3]a and b show the residual spectra for the orion bar and m17 , which show the remaining emission features .",
    "the residual seen around the 3@xmath0 m region comes from the imperfect modeling of the pah band emission , and it does not affect the following discussion . in the range 4.3@xmath14.7@xmath0 m , several features appear clearly .",
    "the strongest one is pf@xmath24 at 4.6538@xmath0 m .",
    "pf@xmath24 in the orion spectrum seems to be broader than other lines and may be blended with the pure rotation line of h@xmath13 s(9 ) at 4.6946@xmath0 m .",

    "the 4.65@xmath0 m emission of the orion spectrum is found to be better fitted by two gaussians at 4.65 and 4.69@xmath0 m , supporting the contribution from the h@xmath13 line ( see below ) .",
    "the presence of h@xmath13 emission in the orion spectrum is also supported by possible detection of other pure rotational lines of h@xmath13 of s(10 ) , s(11 ) , and s(13 ) at 4.41 , 4.18 , and 3.85@xmath0 m , respectively ( figure  [ fig2]a ) .",
    "the s(12 ) line overlaps with br@xmath26 and can not be confirmed .",
    "the h@xmath13 lines are not clearly detected in the m17 spectrum .",
    "the feature at 4.3@xmath0 m , which appears strong in the orion spectrum , is identified as the recombination line of @xmath27@xmath1@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "a broad emission is also seen at around 4.4@xmath0 m .",
    "the line is weak and the presence of a feature around 4.4@xmath0 m is not obvious in the m17 spectrum .",
    "there are no other excess emission features seen in 4.3@xmath14.7@xmath0 m .    to estimate the contribution of recombination lines , we calculate a simple hydrogen recombination line model of the case b conditions with @xmath29k and @xmath30@xmath18 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electron temperature and density of the ionized gas , respectively @xcite and scale it to the observed br@xmath26 intensity .",
    "the estimated emission is shown by the red dotted lines in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "for the orion spectrum we assume no extinction , while we set @xmath33mag for m17 to fit the br@xmath24 intensity .",
    "the models fit most of the recombination lines fairly well , including faint ones , particularly for m17 , suggesting the validity of the case b calculation for the estimate of the line intensities . the uncertainty in @xmath34",
    "is estimated to be smaller than 1mag , which will affect the pf@xmath24 intensity estimated from the br@xmath26 only by 0.7% .",
    "then we subtract the model line emission from the observed spectra and plot the residuals in the range 4@xmath15@xmath0 m in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the locations of the known emission lines ( table  [ table2 ] ) are also indicated in figure  [ fig4]a .",
    "the line at 4.3@xmath0 m remains together with a broad emission around 4.4@xmath0 m in the spectrum of the orion bar .",
    "part of the 4.4@xmath0 m residual emission can be attributed to h@xmath13 s(10 ) and residual hu12 , although the latter is too faint to account for the amount of the entire residual emission .",
    "residual emission is also seen at 4.65@xmath14.7@xmath0 m .",
    "part of the residual comes from h@xmath13 s(9 ) at 4.6946@xmath0 m , which now appears clearly in figure  [ fig4]a . for m17 ,",
    "the residuals are smaller than the orion spectrum .",
    "there may be some residual in the blue part of the pf@xmath24 around 4.6@xmath0 m .",
    "the intensity of the he recombination line depends sensitively on the conditions of the ionized gas in contrast to the hydrogen recombination lines and it is difficult to predict its intensity from the present data accurately .",
    "we can not rule out a possibility of unknown faint emission features present in the ionized gas either . as an alternative way to the case b model calculation",
    ", we make use of the spectra taken at the nh slit , which are dominated by the ionized gas , to estimate the emission lines from the ionized gas in each region . here",
    "we simply assume that the relative emission line intensities do not vary from the nh to ns positions appreciably as a first approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the spectrum estimated from the nh spectra after being scaled to the br@xmath26 intensity and adjusted to the spectral resolution of ns .",
    "the emission line intensities in the nh spectra are also in good agreement with the case b model calculation and thus the overall agreement in the lines is not unexpected .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] plots the residual between the observed ns spectra and the spectra estimated from the nh spectra .",
    "the residual emission at 4.3@xmath0 m in the orion spectrum is reduced , confirming that it comes from the line .",
    "the line emission estimated from the nh spectra also accounts for part of the emission at 4.4@xmath0 m region in the orion , but not perfectly , suggesting a partial contribution from the ionized gas components .",
    "the emission around 4.4@xmath0 m still remains .",
    "the excess emission around 4.65@xmath0 m is also reduced in the m17 spectrum to some extent .",
    "some excess emission is apparent at the position of pf@xmath24 ( 4.65@xmath0 m ) in both spectra .",
    "the residuals in figure  [ fig6 ] are generally smaller than those in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "to estimate the excess intensities conservatively , however , we use the residuals shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , in which the line emission estimated from the case b conditions is subtracted .",
    "we assume that the emission at 4.3@xmath0 m is the line and take account of the emission only at around 4.4@xmath0 m . for the emission around 4.65@xmath0 m , we separate the contribution from h@xmath13 s(9 ) by fitting two gaussians for the orion spectrum and estimate the residual emission at around 4.65@xmath0 m .",
    "for the m17 spectrum , we simply calculate the residual emission at 4.65@xmath0 m .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table3 ] together with the intensities of the pah bands .",
    "intensities of the excess emission are estimated by a fit of the excess with a gaussian and errors are derived from the fitting , also taking account of any observational error . for the estimate of the pah bands , the separation of the 3.41 and 3.48@xmath0 m bands can not be made accurately at this spectral resolution and only the summation of the two features is given .",
    "contribution to the 3.29@xmath0 m band from pf@xmath35 is subtracted assuming the case b model , which is small ( @xmath36% ) for both spectra . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the 3.29@xmath0 m band comes from aromatic ch bonds and the 3.41 and 3.48@xmath0 m bands from aliphatic ch bonds in pahs . the features at 4.4 and 4.65@xmath0 m are assumed to be the corresponding features from aromatic and aliphatic cd bonds in pads , respectively @xcite .",
    "no extinction correction is applied for the estimate of the pah band intensities .",
    "the spectrum that contains contribution from the ionized gas shows a number of emission lines .",
    "it is difficult to predict and identify faint features accurately with the resolution and sensitivity obtained here . to avoid possible faint emission from unknown species in the ionized gas ,",
    "we require a spectrum that does not show a signature of the ionized gas , but has pah emission with a sufficient signal - to - noise in our targets .",
    "most of the spectra taken in the ismgn program show some sign of the ionized gas .",
    "the reflection nebula g18.14.0 is the best target on these criteria in the ismgn sample .",
    "the spectrum of g18.14.0 shows no evidence of the ionized gas , but has prominent pah emission .",
    "there are weak emission features seen in 2.5@xmath13@xmath0 m ( figure  [ fig2]e ) , some of which can be attributed to h@xmath13 1@xmath10 o(2 ) , o(3 ) , and ( 4 ) at 2.627 , 2.803 , and 3.004@xmath0 m ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the o(2 ) line is at the same wavelength as br@xmath24 and the absence of br@xmath26 suggests that the excess at 2.63@xmath0 m is attributable to o(2 ) .",
    "these bands are weak , but at least the o(3 ) line seems to be real .",
    "figure  [ fig4]c plots the residual after the subtraction of the continuum and the pah band emission with the ice absorption for 4@xmath15@xmath0 m ( red dashed line in figure  [ fig2]e ) .",
    "there is small excess emission remaining at around 4.4 and 4.65@xmath0 m .",
    "the detection of h@xmath13 1@xmath10 lines in 2.5@xmath13@xmath0 m suggests possible contribution from h@xmath13 0@xmath10 s(10 ) and s(9 ) to the excess at around 4.4 and 4.65@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the emission features in 2.5@xmath13@xmath0 m are too weak to constrain the emission mechanism and conditions with accuracy , even if they are attributed to the h@xmath13 emission .",
    "therefore , from the present spectra it is rather difficult to estimate the intensities of h@xmath13 s(9 ) and s(10 ) transitions accurately and thus they are not subtracted from the intensity of the excess emission .",
    "the intensities of the excess in g18.14.0 are also listed in table  [ table3 ] together with the pah band intensities . as indicated in table  [ table3 ] the excess emission at 4.65@xmath0",
    "m is only at the 2.5@xmath5 level and the presence of any excess is marginal .",
    "the last three columns of table  [ table3 ] show the ratios of the intensities of pads to those of pahs .",
    "we estimate the ratios for the aromatic ( 4.4@xmath0 m to 3.29@xmath0 m ) and the aliphatic ( 4.65@xmath0 m to 3.41 and 3.48@xmath0 m ) components separately as well as for the total ( aromatic + aliphatic ) pad to pah features .",
    "the aliphatic component in the orion bar and m17 shows the ratios of 4% and 7% , respectively , but the ratios of the aromatic component and the total intensities are all less than 3% .",
    "the effect of extinction is not taken into account in these estimates .",
    "if we take account for the extinction effect for m17 , the ratio will be decreased further by about 20% .",
    "the extinction is estimated to be not significant for the orion bar .",
    "for g18.14.0 , the estimate of extinction using lines is not possible , but weaker ice absorption suggests that the effects should be smaller than for m17 . note that the contributions from lines are subtracted in these estimates , but those from molecular hydrogen are not except for the s(9 ) line in the orion bar .",
    "the present result shows a clear contrast to the results by @xcite , who report the total ratio of @xmath37 for the orion bar and @xmath7 for m17 .",
    "the present spectra do not show any strong excess emission in the 4@xmath0 m region except for pf@xmath24 .",
    "the remaining excess is about 10% of br@xmath26 ( table  [ table3 ] ) and the intensity of pf@xmath24 is predicted with better accuracy than the excess .",
    "this is also supported by the estimate using the nh spectra . the basic result is not affected by the method of the subtraction of the emission lines .",
    "the present observation covers only a part of the aperture of the sws observations and it is possible that strong excess emission is present in the region that the irc observations did not cover . the spatial variation along the ns slit is , however , not significant , and no strong excess emission in the 4@xmath0 m region is seen in the entire slit spectra .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that the present observations miss the right spot in both targets , although we can not rule out the possibility .",
    "it should also be noted that the present estimate gives upper limits on the pad band emission .",
    "the residual spectra , in which the line emission estimated from the ionized gas ( nh ) spectra is subtracted , show smaller residuals , particularly for the 4.4@xmath0 m emission , than those after subtraction of the case b spectra . there could be contributions from faint emission of unknown species at around 4.4@xmath0 m . marginal detection of the excess emission at 4.65@xmath0 m for g18.14.0 also suggests that the residual emission in this spectral range in the orion bar and m17 may have contribution from faint emission components in the ionized gas . for g18.14.0 , there may be contribution from the pure rotation lines of h@xmath13 . since these features are weak , it is difficult to unambiguously attribute the excess emission seen at 4.4 and 4.65@xmath0 m , if real , to deuterated pahs or others from the present data .",
    "spectra with higher spectral resolution and better signal - to - noise ratios are needed to make clear confirmation and identification of these excess emissions . in the above discussion",
    ", we simply compare the intensities of the features in the 3 and 4@xmath0 m regions according to the previous study @xcite .",
    "however , the emission intensity depends on the transition probabilities , which may not be the same for ch and cd bonds .",
    "also the emission in the nir requires high excitation , whose conditions are different between the emission at 3 and 4@xmath0 m",
    ". bands at 4@xmath0 m should be more easily excited than those at 3@xmath0 m .    @xcite show that perdueterated pahs have integrated intensities for their spectroscopic transitions reduced by a factor of 1.75 compared to fully hydrogenated pahs . assuming this reduction factor in the cross - section , we make a calculation based on a simple pah emission model given by @xcite for d / h = 0.1 and 0.025 to roughly estimate the effects .",
    "the 3@xmath0 m pah emission is thought to come mainly from neutral pahs @xcite .",
    "since we discuss only the ratio of the 4.4@xmath0 m to 3.3@xmath0 m band intensity , we simply assume that all the pahs are neutral in the following estimate .",
    "even if a half of the pahs are assumed to be ionized , the band ratio is changed only by 0.5% .",
    "we also assume as a standard case that the temperature of the exciting source is 30000k , and the size distribution of pahs is given by a power - law with the number of carbon atoms in the smallest and largest pahs of 20 and 4000 , respectively .",
    "the results indicate that the ratio of the 4.4@xmath0 m to 3.3@xmath0 m band intensity is about 0.095 and 0.024 , respectively .",
    "easier excitation of the 4.4@xmath0 m band compensates the smaller cross - section , resulting in an intensity ratio similar to the d / h abundance ratio .",
    "the result is obviously sensitive to the assumed parameters of the exciting source and the size distribution of pahs .",
    "if the minimum number of carbon atoms is increased to 50 , the intensity ratio becomes 0.14 and 0.035 , respectively , which are larger than the abundance ratio by about 40% .",
    "thus the observed intensity ratio may overestimate the true d / h ratio by several tens % , but not by an order of magnitude .",
    "the present study does not find evidence for the d fraction of more than 3% in the carriers that emit the 3@xmath0 m pah band emission .",
    "the expected amount of the depleted d onto solid particles depends on the abundance of the observed distribution of the d / h ratios in the ism , which is related to the primordial d abundance via chemical evolution in the galaxy .",
    "the primordial d / h can be estimated from observations of distant quasars .",
    "the latest estimate based on quasar observations suggests ( d / h)@xmath38ppm , which is smaller than a previous estimate @xcite , but is in good agreement with the most recent cosmological parameters deduced from the angular power spectrum of the comics microwave background @xcite .",
    "@xcite make a bayesian analysis on the observations of gaseous d in the ism and find that the maximum and minimum d / h in the ism are @xmath39 and @xmath40ppm , respectively , for a top hat distribution .",
    "the astration factor suggested by these results becomes less than 1.3 , if the variation in the d / h ratio in the ism is attributed to the depletion and the largest ratio is taken as the intrinsic d / h at the present .",
    "the small astration factor can be accounted for by a recent model of the chemical evolution that takes account of the declining star - formation together with the infall of pristine gas onto the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the above analysis of the interstellar d / h distribution suggests that d / h of about 13ppm needs to be depleted onto interstellar grains at maximum . using this value ,",
    "the d / h ratio expected in dust grains is estimated following @xcite .",
    "the c / h in interstellar grains is assumed to be about 200ppm , 85% of which are in aromatic @xcite . for aromatic materials ,",
    "h / c is about 0.35 , which suggests 60ppm of h in aromatic grains .",
    "thus , the expected maximum d / h in pahs is 0.28 .",
    "the present result does not find evidence for d / h @xmath41% in pahs and only accounts for the interstellar d / h variation of @xmath42ppm .",
    "uv observations of d in the ism generally probe regions with medium density and can not investigate dense regions , while current nir spectroscopy is not sensitive enough to detect emission from regions with relatively small optical depth .",
    "thus if deuterated pahs are present only in less dense regions , pad emission can not be detected in the present observations .",
    "unimolecular photodissociation may work at moderate temperatures and can increase d fraction in pahs in regions where uv radiation penetrates @xcite .",
    "however it is difficult to obtain the high concentration of d suggested by the depletion observations with this mechanism .",
    "the observed amount of d depletion may be achieved only by the deuteration process in dense and cold environments @xcite .",
    "if the depletion of d onto pahs predominantly occurs in cold and dense regions and is preserved in diffuse clouds toward which uv observations are carried out , a signature of pads should appear in pdrs , targets of the present observations .",
    "it should be noted that the present observation is only sensitive to the population of the smallest aromatic dust grains that emit 3@xmath14@xmath0 m emission .",
    "if d is depleted in pahs whose size is too large to make prominent emission in the 3@xmath14@xmath0 m region , they could elude detection in the nir spectroscopy .",
    "we estimate the size dependence using the simple model as above . assuming that only pahs whose number of carbon atoms is larger than 50",
    "are deuterated and the total d / h = 0.1 , then the 4.4 to 3.3@xmath0 m band ratio becomes 0.049 .",
    "hence , if a large amount of interstellar d is depleted on pahs , it might reside only in large pahs .",
    "emission expected from large deuterated pahs would appear at longer wavelengths in a more complicated way than at the 4@xmath0 m region because of the interaction between ch and cd in bending modes @xcite . a dedicated search for mir features from large pads",
    "is needed to test the depletion model and make a clear conclusion on d depletion onto pahs .",
    "we made sensitive spectroscopic observations in the nir towards the orion bar , m17 , and the reflection nebula g18.14.0 with the irc on board _",
    "akari_. neither of the spectra of the orion bar nor m17 shows evidence for strong emission features expected from deuterated pahs in the 4@xmath0 m region .",
    "some excess emission remains at around 4.4 and 4.65@xmath0 m after subtraction of the contribution from hydrogen recombination lines , but its intensity is less than previously reported . to avoid potential contributions from faint emission components in ionized gas , the spectrum of the reflection nebula g18.14.0 is also analyzed in a similar way .",
    "it shows a typical pdr spectrum without any sign of ionized gas .",
    "the spectrum indicates slight excess emission at around 4.4@xmath0 m and a marginal detection of the excess at 4.65@xmath0 m ( 2.7@xmath5 ) .",
    "these excess emissions are weak and it should be emphasized that it is difficult to unambiguously rule out other possibilities and attribute these two features to pads because of the low spectral resolution of the present observations . if we assume that they come from aromatic and aliphatic cd in pads , then the ratio of pad ( 4.4 and 4.65@xmath0 m ) to pah ( 3.29 , 3.41 , and 3.48@xmath0 m ) features is estimated as 3% at most in the three targets .",
    "if these 4@xmath0 m features have different origins or there are contributions from other species , the ratio will further be reduced .",
    "the effects of the difference in the cross - section and excitation between the 3 and 4@xmath0 m emission are investigated based on a simple model calculation .",
    "the results suggest that the effects may overestimate the d / h ratio by several tens % , and do not affect the conclusion . the present study does not find evidence for the presence of a large amount of deuterated pahs as predicted from the d depletion model .    the pad / pah ratio required to account for the observed distribution of d in the ism is larger by an order of magnitude than the result of present observations .",
    "if interstellar d is depleted onto pahs , then it must reside in large pahs , which do not contribute dominantly to the nir pah emission .",
    "search for mir emission from pads is needed to further test the d depletion model onto pahs , although the band emission of pads at the mir is more complicated than at the 4@xmath0 m region .",
