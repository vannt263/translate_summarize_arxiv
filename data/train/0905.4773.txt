    "the observation of the supernovae of type ia @xcite provides the evidence that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion . jointing the observations from cosmic background radiation @xcite and sdss @xcite ,",
    "one concludes that the universe at present is dominated by @xmath4 exotic component , dubbed dark energy , which has negative pressure and push the universe to accelerated expansion .",
    "of course , a natural explanation to the accelerated expansion is due to a positive tiny cosmological constant .",
    "though , it suffers the so - called _ fine tuning _ and _ cosmic coincidence _ problems .",
    "however , in @xmath5 confidence level , it fits the observations very well @xcite .",
    "if the cosmological constant is not a real constant but is time variable , the fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problems can be removed .",
    "in fact , this possibility was considered in the past years .",
    "in particular , the dynamic vacuum energy density based on holographic principle are investigated extensively @xcite . according to the holographic principle , the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and has relations with the area of its boundary . by applying the principle to cosmology ,",
    "one can obtain the upper bound of the entropy contained in the universe . for a system with size @xmath6 and uv cut - off @xmath7 without decaying into a black hole",
    ", it is required that the total energy in a region of size @xmath6 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus @xmath8 .",
    "the largest @xmath6 allowed is the one saturating this inequality , thus @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a numerical constant and @xmath11 is the reduced planck mass @xmath12 .",
    "it just means a _ duality _ between uv cut - off and ir cut - off .",
    "the uv cut - off is related to the vacuum energy , and ir cut - off is related to the large scale of the universe , for example hubble horizon , future event horizon or particle horizon as discussed by @xcite . the holographic dark energy in brans - dicke theory is also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    another dark energy model with relations with holographic dark energy , named agegraphic dark energy ,",
    "was also researched extensively recently @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the application of the well - known heisenberg uncertainty relation to the universe . therefore , the energy density of metric fluctuations of minkowski space - time is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is time or length scale . obviously , it looks like the holographic one .",
    "indeed , there some relations between them @xcite .",
    "as known , for any nonzero value of the cosmological constant @xmath7 , a natural length scale and time scale @xmath15 can be introduced into einstein s theory .",
    "reversely , any cosmological length scale and time scale can introduce a cosmological constant or vacuum energy density into einstein s theory . for a positive cosmological constant",
    ", one has @xmath16 when a dynamic time scale is taken , a time variable cosmological constant can be obtained . obviously , a natural time scale is the age of our universe .",
    "inspired by this observation , we can consider time variable cosmological constant from this analogue and let the holographic principle and heisenberg uncertainty relation alone . for its explicit relation with the age of the universe ,",
    "we dub it _ age cosmological constant_.    this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "tvc ] , we give a brief review of a time variable cosmological constant . in section [ sec : age ] , time variable cosmological constants  age cosmological constants  are investigated , where the age of our universe and conformal time are taken as the role of time scales .",
    "section [ sec : con ] are conclusions .",
    "the einstein equation with a cosmological constant is written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter and radiation . from the bianchi identity ,",
    "one has the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath19 , it follows necessarily that @xmath7 is a constant . to have a time variable cosmological constant @xmath20",
    ", one can move the cosmological constant to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee ] ) and take @xmath21 as the total energy - momentum tenor . once again to preserve the bianchi identity or local energy - momentum conservation law , @xmath22 , one has , in a spacial flat frw universe , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy density of time variable cosmological constant and its equation of state is @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the equation of state of ordinary matter , for dark matter @xmath27 .",
    "it is natural to consider interactions between variable cosmological constant and dark matter @xcite , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) . after introducing an interaction term @xmath28",
    ", one has @xmath29 and the total energy - momentum conservation equation @xmath30 for a time variable cosmological constant , the equality @xmath31 still holds .",
    "immediately , one has the interaction term @xmath32 which is different from the interactions between dark matter and dark energy considered in the literatures @xcite where a general interacting form @xmath33 is put by hand .",
    "with observation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rholambda ] ) , the interaction term @xmath28 can be moved to the left hand side of the equation , and one has the effective pressure of variable cosmological constant , dark energy @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the effective dark energy pressure .",
    "also , one can define the effective equation of state of dark energy @xmath36 the friedmann equation as usual can be written as , in a spacial flat frw universe , @xmath37",
    "the age of the universe is defined as @xmath38 taking it as the role of time scale , one has the vacuum energy density @xmath39 where @xmath10 is the model constant . defining the dimensionless energy densities @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the friedmann equation is rewritten as @xmath42 the energy conservation equation ( [ eq : conservation ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "adjoining eq .",
    "( [ eq : time ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhot ] ) and the definition of the dimensionless energy density @xmath45 , one has @xmath46 taking the derivative with respect to @xmath44 from the both sides of the above equation ( [ eq : integral ] ) , one has the differential equation @xmath47 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffh ] ) into above differential equation , one obtains the differential equation of @xmath45 @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "this equation describes the evolution of the dimensionless energy density of dark energy .",
    "clearly , one can see that this equation is different from the corresponding one derived in @xcite , given the initial conditions , and the evolution of the age cosmological constant is different from the one of agegraphic dark energy . with the derivative of the variable of redshift @xmath50 , the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath51(1+z)^{-1}.\\label{eq : tz}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeos ] ) , it is easy to obtain the effective equation of state of dark energy @xmath52 it is in the range of @xmath53 , when one notices the dark energy density rasio @xmath54 .",
    "the form of the effective equation of state of the horizon cosmological constant is different from the one of agegraphic dark energy . in the earlier time",
    "where @xmath55 , one has @xmath56 .",
    "it means at earlier time , the conformal time cosmological constant behaves just like a true cosmological constant .",
    "when the age cosmological constant dominates , its property depends on the parameter @xmath10 strongly .",
    "one can also easily have the deceleration parameter @xmath57 to have an current accelerated expansion of the universe , @xmath58 is required . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t ] , the evolution curves with respect to redshift @xmath50 is plotted with different values of parameter @xmath10 when the initial value @xmath59 is taken .",

    "it is easy to see that the behavior of conformal time cosmological constant is rather different from that of age cosmological constant . at later time where @xmath68 , the effective equation of state goes to @xmath56",
    ", it mimics a true cosmological constant regardless of the value of @xmath10 .",

    "in this paper , time variable cosmological constants , dubbed _ age cosmological constants _ , are investigated inspired by the observations that any nonzero value of the cosmological constant @xmath7 can introduce a natural length scale and time scale into einstein s theory .",
    "reversely , a variable cosmological time or length scale can introduce a time variable positive tiny cosmological constant . here the age of our universe and conformal time were used as time scales .",
    "the results are rather different from that of the so - called agegraphic dark energy models , though the effective equation of state of age cosmological constants are common . but for the different evolution equations of the dimensionless energy density , please see eq.([eq : eheq ] ) and eq.([eq : pheq ] ) ( or eq.([eq : tz ] ) and eq.([eq : ctz ] ) ) .",

    "[ fig : t ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ct ] , the evolution curves were plotted with different values of the model parameter @xmath10 and the same initial condition @xmath69 .",
    "it can be seen that the model only contains the model parameter @xmath10 , here we just put some values of the parameter @xmath10 and leave the precise value to be obtained by fitting cosmic observations such as type ia supernovae , cmb and bao etc .",
