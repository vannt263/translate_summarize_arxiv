    "these quantities correspond to a persistence length of @xmath16 that is about a decade smaller than the confinement radius @xmath17 used in our experiments : @xmath18 . at long time , due to the collisions on the disc boundary , the velocity autocorrelation function sharply drops to 0 as seen in fig .",

    "self - propelled grains  @xcite or autophoretic colloids  @xcite , dilute ensembles of rollers do not accumulate at the boundary .",
    "instead , they bounce off the walls of this virtual box as shown in a close - up of a typical roller trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d , and in the _ supplementary movie 1_. as a result , the outer region of the circular chamber is depleted , and the local packing fraction vanishes as @xmath19 goes to @xmath17 , fig .",

    "consequently , a net inward flow sets in at the vicinity of the bottom electrode . as",
    "the colloidal rollers are prone to reorient in the direction of the local fluid velocity  @xcite , this vortical flow repels the rollers at a distance typically set by the channel height @xmath20 while leaving unchanged the colloid trajectories in the center of the disc .",

    "when the electric field is applied , large groups of rollers akin to the band - shaped swarms reported in  @xcite form and collide .",
    "however , unlike what was observed in periodic geometries , the colloidal swarms are merely transient and ultimately self - organize into a single vortex pattern spanning the entire confining disc as shown in fig .  [ fig3]a and _ supplementary movie 2_. once formed , the vortex is very robust , rotates steadily and retains an axisymmetric shape . in order to go beyond this qualitative picture , we measured the local colloid velocity field @xmath22 and use it to define the polarization field @xmath23 , which quantifies local orientational ordering . the spatial average of @xmath24 vanishes when a coherent vortex forms , therefore we use its projection @xmath25 along the azimuthal direction as a macroscopic order parameter to probe the transition from an isotropic gas to a polar - vortex state . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , @xmath26 displays a sharp bifurcation from an isotropic state with @xmath27 to a globally ordered state with equal probability for left- and right - handed vortices above @xmath28 .",

    "[ fig3]c and [ fig3]d , respectively . at first glance , the system looks phase - separated : a dense and ordered polar - liquid ring where all the colloids cruise along the azimuthal direction encloses a dilute and weakly ordered core at the center of the disc",
    ". we shall also stress that regardless of the average packing fraction , the packing fraction in the vortex core is measured to be very close to @xmath21 , the average concentration below which the population is in a gaseous state , see fig .",
    "this phase - separation picture is consistent with the variations of the area occupied by the ordered outer ring , @xmath29 , for different confinement radii @xmath17 , as shown in fig .",
    "we define @xmath29 as the area of the region where the order parameter exceeds 0.5 , and none of the results reported below depend on this arbitrary choice for the definition of the outer - ring region .",
    "@xmath29 also bifurcates as @xmath10 exceeds @xmath21 , and increases with @xmath17",
    ". remarkably , all the bifurcation curves collapse on a single master curve when @xmath29 is rescaled by the overall confinement area @xmath30 , fig .",
    "[ fig3]f . in other words",
    ", the strongly polarized outer ring always occupies the same area fraction irrespective of the system size , as would a molecular liquid coexisting with a vapor phase at equilibrium .",
    "however , if the system were genuinely phase - separated , one should be able to define an interface between the dense outer ring and the dilute inner core , and this interface should have a constant width .",
    "this requirement is not borne out by our measurements .",
    "the shape of the radial density profiles of the rollers in fig .",
    "[ fig3]g indeed makes it difficult to unambiguously define two homogeneous phases separated by a clear interface . repeating the same experiments in discs of increasing radii",
    ", we found that the density profiles are self - similar , fig .",
    "the width of the region separating the strongly polarized outer ring from the inner core scales with the system size , which is the only characteristic scale of the vortex patterns .",
    "the colloidal vortices therefore correspond to a monophasic yet spatially heterogeneous liquid state .    in order to elucidate the physical mechanisms responsible for this intriguing structure ,",
    "we now introduce a theoretical model that we solve both numerically and analytically . + * numerical simulations .",
    "*        the quincke rollers are electrically powered and move in a viscous fluid , and hence interact at a distance both hydrodynamically and electrostatically . in @xcite , starting from the stokes and maxwell equations , we established the equations of motion of a dilute ensemble of quincke rollers within a pairwise additive approximation .",
    "when isolated , the @xmath31th roller located at @xmath32 moves at a speed @xmath14 along the direction @xmath33 opposite to the in - plane component of the electrostatic dipole responsible for quincke rotation  @xcite .",
    "when interacting via contact and electrostatic repulsive forces , the roller velocity and orientation are related by : @xmath34 inertia is obviously ignored , and for the sake of simplicity we model all the central forces acting on the colloids as an effective hard - disc exclusion @xmath35 of range @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , @xmath37 follows an overdamped dynamics in an effective angular potential capturing both the electrostatic and hydrodynamic torques acting on the colloids  @xcite : @xmath38 the @xmath39 s account for rotational diffusion of the rollers .",
    "they are uncorrelated white noise variables with zero mean and variance @xmath40 . the effective potential in eq .  * [ eq2 ] * is composed of three terms with clear physical interpretations : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the symmetry of these interactions is not specific to colloidal rollers and could have been anticipated phenomenologically exploiting both the translational invariance and the polar symmetry of the surface - charge distribution of the colloids  @xcite .",
    "the first term promotes alignment and is such that the effective potential is minimized when interacting rollers propel along the same direction . @xmath43",
    "is positive , decays exponentially with @xmath44 , and results both from hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions .",
    "the second term gives rise to repulsive _ torques _ , and is minimized when the roller orientation points away from its interacting neighbor .",
    "@xmath45 also decays exponentially with @xmath44 but solely stems from electrostatics .",
    "the third term has a less intuitive meaning , and promotes the alignment of @xmath46 along a dipolar field oriented along @xmath47 .",
    "this term is a combination of hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions , and includes a long - ranged contribution .",
    "the functions @xmath43 , @xmath45 , and @xmath48 are provided in the _ supplementary discussion 2_. as it turns out , all the physical parameters ( roller velocity , field amplitude , fluid viscosity , etc . )",
    "that are needed to compute their exact expressions have been measured , or estimated up to logarithmic corrections , see _ supplementary discussion 2_. we are then left with a model having a single free parameter that is the range , @xmath36 , of the repulsive _ forces _ between colloids .",
    "we numerically solved this model in circular simulation boxes of radius @xmath17 with reflecting boundary conditions using an explicit euler scheme with adaptive time - stepping .",
    "all the numerical results are discussed using the same units as in the experiments to facilitate quantitative comparisons .",
    "the simulations revealed a richer phenomenology than the experiments , as captured by the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a corresponding to @xmath49 . by systematically varying the range of the repulsive forces and the particle concentration",
    ", we found that the @xmath50 plane is typically divided into three regions . at small packing fractions ,",
    "the particles hardly interact and form an isotropic gaseous phase . at high fractions , after transient dynamics strikingly similar to that observed in the experiments , the rollers self - organize into a macroscopic vortex pattern , fig .",
    "[ fig4]b and _ supplementary movie 3_. however , at intermediate densities , we found that collective motion emerges in the form of a macroscopic swarm cruising around the circular box through an ensemble of randomly moving particles , fig .",
    "[ fig4]c and _ supplementary movie 4_. these swarms are akin to the band patterns consistently reported for polar active particles at the onset of collective motion in periodic domains  @xcite .",
    "this seeming conflict between our experimental and numerical findings is solved by looking at the variations of the swarm length @xmath51 with the confinement radius @xmath17 in fig .",
    "we define @xmath51 as the correlation length of the density fluctuations in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the angular extension of the swarms @xmath52 increases linearly with the box radius .",
    "therefore , for a given value of the interaction parameters , there exists a critical box size above which the population undergoes a direct transition from a gaseous to an axisymmetric vortex state . for @xmath53 , which was measured to be the typical interparticle distance in the polar liquid state  @xcite ,",
    "this critical confinement is @xmath2 .",
    "this value is close to the smallest radius accessible in our experiments where localized swarms were never observed , thereby solving the apparent discrepancy with the experimental phenomenology .",
    "more quantitatively , we systematically compare our numerical and experimental measurements in figs .",
    "[ fig3]b and [ fig3]c for @xmath2 . even though a number of simplifications were needed to establish eqs .  * [ eq1 ] * ,  * [ eq2 ] * and  * [ eq3 ] *  @xcite , the simulations account very well for the sharp bifurcation yielding the vortex patterns as well as their self - similar structure .",
    "this last point is proven quantitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig3]h , which demonstrates that the concentration increases away from the vortex core , where @xmath54 , over a scale that is solely set by the confinement radius .",
    "we shall note however that the numerical simulations underestimate the critical packing fraction @xmath21 at which collective motion occurs , which is not really surprising given the number of approximations required to establish the interaction parameters in the equations of motion eq .",
    "we unambiguously conclude from this set of results that eqs .  * 1 * , * 2 * and * 3 * include all the physical ingredients that chiefly dictate the collective dynamics of the colloidal rollers .",
    "we now exploit the opportunity offered by the numerics to turn on and off the four roller - roller interactions one at a time , namely the alignment torque , @xmath55 , the repulsion torque @xmath56 and force @xmath36 , and the dipolar coupling @xmath57 .",
    "snapshots of the resulting particle distributions are reported in fig .",
    "none of these four interactions alone yields a coherent macroscopic vortex .",
    "we stress that when the particles solely interact via pairwise - additive alignment torques , @xmath58 , the population condenses into a single compact polarized swarm .",
    "potential velocity - alignment interactions are _ not _ sufficient to yield macroscopic vortical motion .",
    "we evidence in fig .",
    "[ fig4]e ( top - right and bottom - left panels ) that the combination of alignment ( @xmath59 ) and of repulsive interactions ( @xmath60 and/or @xmath61 ) is necessary and sufficient to observe spontaneously flowing vortices . + * analytical theory .",
    "* having identified the very ingredients necessary to account for our observations , we can now gain more detailed physical insight into the spatial structure of the vortices by constructing a minimal hydrodynamic theory .",
    "we start from eqs .  * 1 * , * 2 * and * 3 * , ignoring the @xmath57 term in eq .  * 3*. the model can be further simplified by inspecting the experimental variations of the individual roller velocity with the local packing fraction , see _ supplementary figure 1_. the roller speed only displays variations of 10@xmath62 as @xmath63 increases from @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "these minute variations suggest ignoring the contributions of the repulsive forces in eq .  * 1 * , and solely considering the interplay between the alignment and repulsion torques on the orientational dynamics of eq .  *",
    "2*. these simplified equations of motion are coarse - grained following a conventional kinetic - theory framework reviewed in  @xcite to establish the equivalent to the navier - stokes equations for this two - dimensional active fluid . in a nutshell , the two observables we need to describe are the local area fraction @xmath66 and the local momentum field @xmath67 .",
    "they are related to the first two angular moments of the one - particle distribution function @xmath68 , which evolves according to a fokker - plank equation derived from the conservation of @xmath69 and eqs .  * [ eq1 ] * and * [ eq2]*. this equation is then recast into an infinite hierarchy of equations for the angular moments of @xmath69 .",
    "the two first equations of this hierarchy , corresponding to the mass conservation equation and to the momentum dynamics , are akin to the continuous theory first introduced phenomenologically by toner and tu  @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the usual nematic order parameter .",
    "the meaning of the first equation is straightforward , while the second calls for some clarifications . the divergence term on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "* [ eq5 ] * is a convective kinematic term associated with the self - propulsion of the particles .",
    "the force field @xmath72 on the right - hand side would vanish for non - interacting particles . here , at first order in a gradient expansion , @xmath72",
    "is given by : @xmath73 this force field has a clear physical interpretation .",
    "the first term reflects the damping of the polarization by the rotational diffusion of the rollers .",
    "the second term , defined by the time rate @xmath74 , echoes the alignment rule at the microscopic level and promotes a nonzero local polarization .",
    "the third term , involving @xmath75 , is an anisotropic pressure reflecting the repulsive interactions between rollers at the microscopic level .",
    "eqs .  * [ eq4 ] * and * [ eq5 ] * are usually complemented by a dynamical equation for @xmath76 and a closure relation .",
    "this additional approximation , however , is not needed to demonstrate the existence of vortex patterns and to rationalize their spatial structure .    looking for axisymmetric steady states",
    ", it readily follows from mass conservation , eq .  *",
    "[ eq4 ] * , that the local fields must take the simple forms : @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "we also infer the relation @xmath81\\phi \\pi_\\varphi=0 $ ] from the projection of the momentum equation , eq .  * [ eq5 ] * , on the azimuthal direction .",
    "this relation tells us that the competition between rotational diffusion and local alignment results in a mean - field transition from an isotropic state with @xmath27 to a polarized vortex state with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this transition occurs when @xmath66 exceeds @xmath84 , the ratio of the rotational diffusivity to the alignment strength at the hydrodynamic level .",

    "* [ eq5 ] * on the radial direction sets the spatial structure of the ordered phase : @xmath85 with again @xmath86 in the ordered polar phase .",
    "this equation has a clear physical meaning and expresses the balance between the centrifugal force arising from the advection of momentum along a circular trajectory and the anisotropic pressure induced by the repulsive interactions between rollers .",
    "it has an implicit solution given by @xmath87 .",

    "given the experimental values of the microscopic parameters , @xmath89 is much smaller that unity ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "an asymptotic analysis reveals that @xmath91 is the typical core radius of the vortex . for @xmath92 , the density increases slowly as @xmath93 $ ] for all @xmath10 and @xmath17 .",
    "as @xmath19 reaches @xmath91 , it increases significantly and then growths logarithmically as @xmath94 away from the vortex core .",
    "however , @xmath91 is an integration constant which is solely defined via the mass conservation relation : @xmath95 and therefore only depends on @xmath10 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath91 does not provide any intrinsic structural scale , and the vortex patterns formed in different confinements are predicted to be self - similar in agreement with our experiments and simulations despite the simplification made in the model , fig .",
    "in addition , eq .  * [ eq8 ] * implies that the rollers self - organize by reducing their density at the center of the vortex down to @xmath96 , the mean area fraction at the onset of collective motion , again in excellent agreement with our measurements in fig .",
    "[ fig3]e .    in order to characterize the orientational structure of the vortices ,",
    "an additional closure relation is now required .",
    "the simplest possible choice consists in neglecting correlations of the orientational fluctuations , and therefore assuming @xmath97 .",
    "this choice implies that @xmath98 eqs .  *",
    "[ eq8 ] * and * [ eq9 ] * provide a very nice fit of the experimental polarization curve as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , and therefore capture both the pitchfork bifurcation scenario at the onset of collective motion and the saturation of the polarization at high packing fractions .",
    "the best fit is obtained for values of @xmath21 and @xmath99 respectively five and two times larger than those deduced from the microscopic parameters .",
    "given the number of simplifications needed to establish both the microscopic and hydrodynamic models , the agreement is very convincing .",
    "we are then left with a hydrodynamic theory with no free fitting parameter , which we use to compute the area fraction of the outer polarized ring where @xmath100 .",
    "the comparison with the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig3]f is excellent .",
    "furthermore , eqs .  * [ eq8 ] * and * [ eq9 ] * predict that the rollers are on the verge of a phase separation .",
    "if the roller fraction in the vortex core were smaller ( @xmath101 ) , orientational order could not be supported and an isotropic bubble would nucleate in a polar liquid .",
    "this phase separation is avoided by the self - regulation of @xmath102 at @xmath21 .",
    "altogether our theoretical results confirm that the vortex patterns stem from the interplay between self - propulsion , alignment , repulsion and confinement .",
    "self - propulsion and alignment interactions promote a global azimuthal flow .",
    "the repulsive interactions prevent condensation of the population on the geometrical boundary and allow for extended vortex patterns .",
    "if the rollers were not confined , the population would evaporate as self - propulsion induces a centrifugal force despite the absence of inertia .",
    "we close this discussion by stressing on the generality of this scenario .",
    "firstly , the vortex patterns do not rely on the perfect rotational symmetry of the boundaries . as illustrated in _",
    "supplementary figure 2 _ the same spatial organization is observed for a variety of convex polygonal geometries .",
    "however , strongly anisotropic , and/or strongly non - convex confinements can yield other self - organized states such as vortex arrays which we will characterize elsewhere . secondly ,",
    "neither the nature of the repulsive couplings nor the symmetry of the interactions yielding collective motion are crucial , thereby making the above results relevant to a much broader class of experimental systems .",
    "for instance , self - propelled particles endowed with nematic alignment rules are expected to display the same large - scale phenomenology .",
    "the existence of a centrifugal force does not rely on the direction of the individual trajectories . shaken rods , concentrated suspensions of bacteria , or motile biofilaments , among other possible realizations ,",
    "are expected to have a similar phase behavior .",
    "quantitative local analysis of their spatial patterns  @xcite would make it possible to further test and elaborate our understanding of the structure of confined active matter . for instance , the polar order found in confined bacteria is destroyed upon increasing the size of the confinement .",
    "the analysis of the spacial distribution of the bacteria could be used to gain insight on the symmetries and the magnitude of the additional interactions mediated by the host fluid which are responsible for the emergence of bacterial turbulence  @xcite .    in conclusion , we take advantage of a model experimental system where ensembles of self - propelled colloids with well - established interactions self - organize into macrosopic vortices when confined by circular geometric boundaries .",
    "we identify the physical mechanism that chiefly dictates this emergent behavior .",
    "thanks to a combination of numerical simulations and analytical theory , we demonstrate that orientational couplings alone can not account for collective circular motion .",
    "repulsion between the motile individuals is necessary to balance the centrifugal flow intrinsic to any ordered active fluid and to stabilize heterogeneous yet monophasic states in a broad class of active fluids .",
    "a natural challenge is to extend this description to the compact vortices observed in the wild , e.  g. in shoals of fish . in the absence of confining boundaries ,",
    "the centrifugal force has to be balanced by additional density - regulation mechanisms  @xcite . a structural investigation akin to the one introduced here for roller vortices",

    "the maxwell - wagner time @xmath124 characterizes the dynamics of the electric charges at the colloid surface , which are responsible for the quincke instability . @xmath125 and @xmath126 are mobility coefficients accounting for the viscous drag exerted by the liquid in the vicinity of solid wall that depend logarithmically on the distance to the solid wall @xcite . in order to account for the roller - roller interactions at long distances ,",
    "we have computed the electrostatic and hydrodynamic fields induced by the motion of a colloid . assuming pairwise additive interactions",

    "<S> coherent vortical motion has been reported in a wide variety of populations including living organisms ( bacteria , fishes , human crowds ) and synthetic active matter ( shaken grains , mixtures of biopolymers ) , yet a unified description of the formation and structure of this pattern remains lacking . </S>",
    "<S> here we report the self - organization of motile colloids into a macroscopic steadily rotating vortex . combining physical experiments and numerical simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate this collective behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the emergent - vortex structure lives on the verge of a phase separation , and single out the very constituents responsible for this state of polar active matter . building on this observation </S>",
    "<S> , we establish a continuum theory and lay out a strong foundation for the description of vortical collective motion in a broad class of motile populations constrained by geometrical boundaries .    building upon the pioneering work of vicsek et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , physicists , mathematicians and biologists have contemplated the self - organization of living - organism groups into flocks as an emergent process stemming from simple interaction rules at the individual level  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has been supported by quantitative trajectory analysis in animal groups  @xcite , together with a vast number of numerical and theoretical models  @xcite , and more recently by the observations of flocking behavior in ensembles of non - living motile particles such as shaken grains , active colloids , and mixtures of biofilaments and molecular motors  @xcite . from a physicist s perspective </S>",
    "<S> , these various systems are considered as different instances of polar active matter , which encompasses any ensemble of motile bodies endowed with local velocity - alignment interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the current paradigm for flocking physics is the following . </S>",
    "<S> active particles are persistent random walkers , which when dilute form a homogeneous isotropic gas . upon increasing density , collective motion emerges in the form of spatially localized swarms that may cruise in a sea of randomly moving particles ; further increasing density , a homogeneous polar liquid forms and spontaneously flows along a well - defined direction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is the outcome of experiments , simulations and theories mostly performed in unbounded or periodic domains .    beyond this picture , </S>",
    "<S> significant attention has been devoted over the last five years to confined active matter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> confined active particles have consistently , yet not systematically , been reported to self - organize into vortex - like structures . however , unlike for our understanding of flocking , we are still lacking a unified picture to account for the emergence and structure of such vortex patterns . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is mostly due to the extreme diversity in the nature and symmetries of the interactions between the active particles that have been hitherto considered . </S>",
    "<S> do active vortices exist only in finite - size systems as in the case of bacterial suspensions  @xcite , which lose this beautiful order and display intermittent turbulent dynamics  @xcite when unconfined ? </S>",
    "<S> what are the necessary interactions required to observe and/or engineer bona fide stationary swirling states of active matter ?    in this paper , we answer these questions by considering the impact of geometrical boundaries on the collective behavior of motile particles endowed with velocity - alignment interactions . combining quantitative experiments on motile colloids , numerical simulations and analytical theory , we elucidate the phase behavior of _ polar _ active matter restrained by geometrical boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> we use colloidal rollers which , unlike most of the available biological self - propelled bodies , interact via well established dynamical interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we first exploit this unique model system to show that above a critical concentration populations of motile colloids undergo a non - equilibrium phase transition from an isotropic gaseous state to a novel ordered state where the entire population self - organizes into a single heterogeneous steadily rotating vortex . </S>",
    "<S> this self - organization is _ not _ the consequence of the finite system size . </S>",
    "<S> rather , this emergent vortex is a genuine state of polar active matter lying on the verge of a macroscopic phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> this novel state is the only ordered phase found when unidirectional directed motion is hindered by convex isotropic boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate theoretically that a competition between alignment , repulsive interactions and confinement is necessary to yield large - scale vortical motion in ensembles of motile particles interacting via alignment interactions , thereby extending the relevance of our findings to a broad class of active materials . </S>"
