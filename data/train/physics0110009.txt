    "there is a long discussion in the scientific world about the form of wind generated sea wave spectrum in the `` universal '' region of frequencies @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the frequency of the spectral maximum .",
    "there are two main points of view .",
    "the first one proposed by phillips in 1958 gives us the phillips spectrum in universal region @xmath5 where @xmath6 is dimensionless constant , which according to experimental data appears to be rather small @xmath7 .",
    "the second point of view introduced by zakharov and filonenko ( 1966 ) gives us in universal region following spectrum @xmath8 where @xmath9 - is dimensionless constant , @xmath10 - is wind velocity , @xmath11 - is the ration between ocean water and atmosphere densities .",
    "the ( [ phil-1 ] ) and ( [ zakhfil ] ) formulas are based upon completely opposite propositions . the phillips spectrum ( [ phil-1 ] ) takes place if the spectrum at the high frequency region is mainly determined by appearance of sharp crests and wave breaking .",
    "the level of nonlinearity depending on steepness @xmath12 in this case at least at the level of the wave peaks is extremely high - @xmath13 .    on the other side spectrum ( [ zakhfil ] ) is based on presumption of small mean steepness - @xmath14 .",
    "this proposition is in great concordance with observed data .",
    "usually @xmath15 .    following this ideology",
    "the wind generated waves ensemble is described by hasselman kinetic equation ( hasselman 1962,1963 ) @xmath16 zakharov - filonenko spectrum appears as exact solution of the particular case of eq .",
    "( [ hasselman ] ) @xmath17 this is a classical case of kolmogorov - zakharov ( kz ) spectra .",
    "this weakly turbulent theory is far advanced both analytically and numerically ( zakharov and filonenko 1967 , 1966 ; craik 1987 ; zakharov at al . 1992 ; pushkarev and zakharov 1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "a lot of experimental observations ( forristall , 1981 ; kahma , 1981 ; donelan , 1985 , 1998 , hansen at al . 1990 ) beginning from famous work of toba ( 1973 ) gives us evidences that in most cases at moderately high frequencies @xmath18 the zakharov - filonenko spectrum ( [ zakhfil ] ) is well detected .",
    "sometimes in the region of extremely high frequencies @xmath19 the phillips spectrum ( [ phil-1 ] ) takes place .",
    "`` universality '' of spectrum @xmath20 became obvious in the middle of eighties . in 1986",
    "o. phillips , `` father '' of @xmath21 spectrum published an article with confession that spectrum ( [ phil-1 ] ) may takes place only at high frequency region and is not universal .    in the region of moderate frequencies the @xmath20 spectrum is dominating with confidence .",
    "from this fact the question of physical interpretation of spectrum @xmath22 becomes very important .",
    "the origin of this spectrum is rather obvious from our point of view .",
    "this spectrum is just weakly turbulent kz - spectrum .",
    "there are another explanations , though .",
    "one of them was proposed by phillips in 1986 .",
    "he made supposition that spectrum @xmath20 is a result of balance of all three terms of eq.([hasselman ] ) @xmath23 this affirmation unlikely can be treated as a serious theory , because the expression of @xmath24 is completely unknown .",
    "there are only very rough empirical formulas .",
    "however in that paper this expression was taken in the form giving us the balance in eq .",
    "( [ phil-2 ] ) .",
    "but there is no any ground for this assumption .",
    "another explanation was proposed by banner ( 1990 ) and developed by donelan ( 1998 ) .",
    "they consider the @xmath20 spectrum as an artifact of the observation of time histories at a point brought about by doppler shifting of the short waves riding on the orbital currents of the long waves .",
    "let us suppose that spatial spectrum of the short waves @xmath25 is known .",
    "the problem is to derive the frequency spectrum @xmath26 using only @xmath25 .",
    "normally we have to assume that waves obey linear dispersion equation . in this case",
    "the following simple expression takes place @xmath27 however in the presence of long waves the dispersion law of the short waves modifies due to doppler effect at the orbital velocity s field @xmath28 of the long wave component @xmath29 where @xmath28 is the chaotic quasi - periodic function of time with the zero mean value . in this case",
    "the frequency spectrum @xmath26 becomes wider .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the quantitative theory of this without any doubt very important phenomenon .",
    "we consider it in a very simplified way , supposing that @xmath28 is sinusoidal function of time , i.e. assuming that the long wave is strictly monochromatic .",
    "this supposition is not too unreal .",
    "undoubtedly this gives us the correct order of magnitude .",
    "all the more the result of this paper is quite clearly understandable .    in sect .",
    "2 we introduced the general notations ( following phillips ) . in sect .",
    "3 the general formula for spectrum ( taking into account doppler shifting ) is derived .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new set of dimensionless variables , this is considered in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .",
    "5 we develop an important case of dispersion @xmath30 ( `` deep water '' ) where g is the gravity acceleration , k is the wave number equal to @xmath31 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to numerical results .",
    "the conclusion is placed in sect .",
    "7 .    at the case of sufficiently small steepness @xmath32",
    ", the doppler effect appears to be too weak to explain the clearly observed difference of @xmath21 spectrum and experimental results , at least in the region of universal frequencies @xmath33 .",
    "this fact makes too detailed inspection redundant",
    ".    however , it is worth to say , that at higher frequencies the doppler shifting can play very important role .",
    "this fact can not influence on interpretation of experimental data at moderate frequencies though . at our standpoint",
    "the only conclusive interpretation of observed spectrum @xmath20 is treating it as weak turbulent kolmogorov - zakharov spectrum .",
    "it is worth to add that many direct measurements of spatial spectrum @xmath34 by photographing of the ocean surface and completely excluding the doppler effect influence give us in the region of moderately high wave numbers the expectable result @xmath35 this fact is in great accordance with frequency spectrum @xmath22 at the absence of doppler shifting .",
    "following the notations of phillips , the wave spectrum for homogeneous stationary wave field can be introduced as follows @xmath36 d\\mathbf r dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the covariance of the surface displacement @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the spatial separation vector , t is the time separation , @xmath40 is the wavenumber vector ( the second representation is just the same in polar coordinates ) and @xmath1 is the radian frequency . obviously it can be rewritten in terms of fourier transforms of corresponding functions @xmath41 @xmath42 it is convenient to introduce additional spectra which are the reduced forms of eq .",
    "( [ spectrum ] ) @xmath43 @xmath44 in general case it is impossible to express @xmath26 in terms of @xmath45 .",
    "but in the case of small wave amplitude we can use the linearized equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the dispersion law and @xmath48 is the dirac delta - function .",
    "now one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ f_def ] ) in the following form @xmath49 let us remember that @xmath50 @xmath51 using the rules of integration of @xmath48-function one can obtain @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the inverse function for @xmath54 .",
    "in the deep water case @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 for an isotropic spectrum ( @xmath58 ) @xmath59 for a strongly anisotropic spectrum ( @xmath60 ) @xmath61 if the spectrum is determined by discontinuities of spatial derivative ( wedges ) caused by wave breaking according to phillips ( 1958 ) , we have @xmath62 in the isotropic case substitution eq .",
    "( [ phillips_theory ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ i_spectrum_begin ] ) gives @xmath63 similar calculation for eq .",
    "( [ sa_spectrum_begin ] ) gives us the following result @xmath64 here @xmath6 is the so - called phillips constant .",
    "if the wedges appear on each wave crest , @xmath6 should not be too small ( @xmath65 ) . any attempts to fit eq .",
    "( [ phillips - isotropic ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ phillips - anisotropic ] ) to experimental facts give for @xmath6 at least one order of magnitude less .",
    "let us assume that we study waves on the background of periodic current @xmath66 beneath the surface .",
    "taking into account the doppler effect in the dispersion equation one can get the following substitution    @xmath67 suppose that this current is described by a one - dimensional periodic function @xmath68 this allows us to rewrite our substitution in the following form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the angle formed by @xmath71 and @xmath72 vectors",
    ". without loss of generality one can take @xmath73 . using this expression one can write mean value of expression ( [ f_def_linear ] ) as where @xmath74 is the period equal to @xmath75 .",
    "it is useful to take the average with respect to @xmath76 as the first step .",
    "let us denote this factor to the part of the integral as @xmath77 @xmath78 the @xmath48-function in this expression gives us the equation @xmath79 this equation have the following roots @xmath80 when the following inequality satisfied @xmath81 @xmath82 using ( [ roots ] ) and the last expression one can get the multiplier using this expression one can get @xmath83    it is necessary to understand that the limits of integration have to be chosen in order to satisfy inequality ( [ inequality ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new variable and a constant @xmath84 one can see that @xmath85 is a dimensionless analogue of @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is just the same for @xmath1 . in these variables",
    "the spectrum eq .",
    "( [ spectrum_dim ] ) takes the following relatively simple form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the constant which appears as a result of the substitution @xmath90 in @xmath25 . for the phillips spectrum case",
    "( [ phillips_theory ] ) this constant takes the form @xmath91 .",
    "the physical meaning of the constant @xmath87 becomes more obvious if we transform it to the following form @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the peak - frequency ( this is the only frequency - like scale in the model ) and @xmath94 is the phase velocity .",
    "the ratio @xmath95 according to banner ( 1990 ) is @xmath96 in magnitude .    for the case of strongly anisotropic spectrum ( @xmath97 )",
    "one can easily obtain the following result by a simple substitution in eq .",
    "( [ spectrum_dimless ] )    @xmath98    if the spectrum is isotropic ( @xmath58 ) things become a little more complex . following eq .",

    "( [ isotr_spectrum_init_1 ] ) one can obtain expressions ( [ anisotr_spectrum_init ] ) and ( [ isotr_spectrum_init ] ) are valid for an arbitrary dispersion relation @xmath101 .",
    "for further study of the isotropic spectrum ( this case is more complex so let us do it first and then perform the same calculations for the anisotropic case ) we have to introduce the form of the dispersion law .",
    "we think that the case of the deep water surface is the most important .",
    "we have to use explicit expression of @xmath102 , in the case of a deep water @xmath103 or @xmath104 now we have to take into account condition ( [ inequality ] ) @xmath105 solving this inequality gives us @xmath106 where @xmath107 , so we can state that interesting domains are let us explore special case , when @xmath108 is a quickly going down to zero function , like phillips spectrum @xmath109 . in this case we can take into account only first part of (  [ isotr_first_domain ] ) at @xmath110 .",
