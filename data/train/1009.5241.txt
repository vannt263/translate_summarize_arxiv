    "quantum walks ( qws ) provide the natural - yet unitary - extension of the classical random walk ( rw ) to the quantum regime @xcite , where the superposition principle allows a wave function to explore different paths simultaneously . the resulting interference in the transition amplitudes is cause to effects like the linear increase in time of the mean travelled distance of the quantum walker @xcite .",
    "this ballistic behavior contrasts with the diffusive behavior of a classical particle performing a rw , whose mean travelled distance increases with the square root of time .",
    "single - particle qws , as realized in various experiments @xcite , can also be mimicked with classical wave mechanics @xcite .",
    "in contrast , qws with two particles @xcite show purely quantum features due to many - particle interference or entanglement that no classical system can provide . for larger particle numbers ,",
    "it is unknown how the emerging hierarchy of many - particle interference effects in terms of the number of contributing particles affects physical observables .",
    "we will derive a general expression for multi - mode particle number correlation functions which gives access to this hierarchy , and provide first examples as manifest in prominent interference structures in two - mode number correlation functions .",
    "while the qw constitutes a paradigmatic testing ground for the study of such many - particle interference , the formalism we present applies to _ any _ linear , non - interacting scattering scenario .    in a many - particle qw ,",
    "the distinction between effects of single - particle interference and those due to genuine many - particle interference is crucial .",
    "since distinguishable particles show no many - particle interference , a scenario with non - interacting , distinguishable particles @xcite is equivalent to many subsequent , independent single - particle walks . given the position probability distribution of an individual particle , standard combinatorics suffices to derive the many - body counting statistics .",
    "therefore , the differences in the behavior of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles highlight true multi - particle interference .",
    "we will see that these differences are not detectable by the mean particle number , but only by observables which capture many - particle correlations .",
    "the counting statistics thus encodes an unambiguous signature of many - particle coherence and interference and is readily accessible in the experiment .",
    "we consider a many - particle qw @xcite in one dimension , physically realized by n particles which propagate through an array of l unbiased beam splitters ( bs ) as depicted in fig .",

    ", width=264 ]    a particle that passes a single bs will leave it in a coherent superposition of the two output modes , as described by the unitary @xmath1 matrix @xmath2 while the particles propagate through the array , we have to distinguish two inequivalent steps , as depicted in fig .  [ arraypic ] : the direct sum @xmath3 of the single bs matrices u describes odd time steps , where modes 1 and 2 enter one beam splitter , modes 3 and 4 enter the next and so forth . in the following step , modes 2 and 3 couple into the same bs , and so do modes 4 and 5 etc .",
    "even steps are thus described by @xmath4 , with matrix elements @xmath5}$ ] of @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 describes the evolution for n time steps .",
    "the creation operator of a particle @xmath9 in mode j at time step 0 is mapped onto a superposition of the creation operators at time step n , with 2l the maximum number of modes : @xmath10 given an n - particle initial state , distributed over 2l input modes , @xmath11 eq .  ( [ unitev ] ) implies the evolution into the output state @xmath12 in ( [ inistate ] , [ prodfin ] ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the vacuum state and the occupation number of mode j ( such that @xmath15 ) , respectively .",
    "note that the number of terms in ( [ prodfin ] ) grows exponentially with n , so that simulations of the dynamics of many - particle qws are practically impossible for larger systems .",
    "however , expectation values of many experimental observables can be derived without complete knowledge of the full final state .",
    "one class of such observables which reveals many - body interference are particle number correlation functions @xmath16 of m output modes @xmath17 . for m=1 ,",
    "this is the single - mode particle expectation number , @xmath18 , simply given by the sum of 2l single - particle densities of a single - particle qw , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the transition amplitude from mode k to mode i , and we left out the dependence of @xmath20 on n , for simplicity of notation .",
    "( [ density ] ) holds for both , fermions and bosons , as well as for distinguishable particles . within these different particle - families ,",
    "various distinct initial states are mapped on final states with the same mean particle number by the beam splitter array .",
    "many - particle interference does not manifest on this level , and no information about the many - particle coherence of the state is obtained , as anticipated above .",
    "this is different when we correlate detection events in two different modes , i.e. m=2 ( the upper / lower @xmath21-sign refers to bosons / fermions ) : @xmath22    the two sums in this equation represent two physically distinct processes : in the first , the particles originate from _ different _ modes .",
    "the two - particle amplitude @xmath23 describes the simultaneous transition of one particle from mode k to i , and of another one from l to j. due to the indistinguishability of the particles , this amplitude interferes with that where k and l are exchanged .",
    "the second sum accounts for particles that originate from the _ same _ mode .",
    "the corresponding many - particle amplitude @xmath24 is invariant upon exchange of the input modes , and hence exhibits no many - particle interference .",
    "( [ density ] , [ 2correlator ] ) exhaust all possible correlations between two particles injected into the bs array . only higher order correlations between a larger number of particles can exhibit genuine many - particle interference effects . since the number of distinct correlations increases like the factorial of the particle number n , a general expression for the m - mode particle number correlation function is desirable , and can be shown to read @xmath25 where @xmath26 . the function @xmath27 is given by unity for bosons ( b ) , and by the sign of the permutation in its argument for fermions ( f ) .",

    "( [ expval ] ) runs over all ordered combinations @xmath28 of input modes the particles may have originated from .",
    "every single summand represents a physically distinct event .",
    "each such event , in turn , is given by the _",
    "coherent _ sum over all s(@xmath29 ) permutations @xmath30 of @xmath29 , due to the particles indistinguishability , where @xmath31 represents the j - th element of @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , ( [ expval ] ) reproduces ( [ density ] ) and ( [ 2correlator ] ) for m=1 and m=2 , respectively , with the two sums in ( [ 2correlator ] ) corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33 in ( [ expval ] ) .",
    "expression ( [ expval ] ) permits to infer a large variety of many - particle observables , including the particle number counting statistics . since the latter are restricted to occupation numbers zero or one for fermions , we concentrate on bosons in the following .",
    "the counting statistics of mode i , i.e. the probability @xmath34 to find k particles in mode i , is defined by the linear relation @xmath35 where the @xmath36 are determined via eq .",
    "( [ expval ] ) . this relation can be inverted to yield @xmath34 , if all moments @xmath37 are known .",
    "analogously , the counting statistics @xmath38 of two modes i and j , _ i.e. _ the joint probability to find exactly @xmath39 particles in mode i and @xmath40 particles in mode j , is given in terms of @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "thus all two - mode moments @xmath43 are required for the two - mode counting statistics .",
    "multi - mode counting statistics for more than two modes are obtained in strictly analogous fashion .      with these tools",
    ", we can now fully characterize the distribution of particles among the modes , and work out the observable consequences of many - particle interference : we start out with n=8 particles , launched in eight adjacent modes at the center of an array of length 2l=50 , and initially in a product state ( [ inistate ] ) .",

    "bosonic bunching enhances p@xmath45(k ) for bosons by several orders of magnitude ( blue circles ) as compared to the result for distinguishable particles ( red squares ) .",
    "the inset shows the distribution for small k.,width=283 ]    the probability decreases with k , both for bosons and distinguishable particles .",
    "since , however , for bosons all many - particle amplitudes that contribute to the coherent sum in ( [ expval ] ) are identical , they interfere constructively .",
    "consequently , the probability to find more than two particles in one mode decreases much slower for bosons than for distinguishable particles . for the latter , p@xmath45(k )",
    "exhibits poissonian decrease like 1/k!. in contrast , in the limit of many particles , p@xmath45(k ) can be shown to approach exponential decrease in the bosonic case , which is apparent in fig .",
    "[ onesite ] for low and intermediate values of k. for k = n=8 , p@xmath45(k ) is equal to @xmath46 in ( [ qone ] ) .",
    "there , all n !",
    "amplitudes in the coherent sum in ( [ expval ] ) are necessarily equal .",
    "thus , bosonic bunching @xcite induces a factor n!=8 ! as compared to distinguishable particles . for @xmath47 , p@xmath45(k )",
    "is a sum of several @xmath48 , what prevents such simple derivation of the bosonic value of p@xmath45(k ) .",
    "further note that , since the number of constructively interfering amplitudes grows monotonically with the number of detected particles , the distribution in fig .",
    "[ onesite ] is smooth ( in contrast to the strong fluctuations in fig .",
    "[ twomodecut ] below ) , and , in particular , it is qualitatively independent of the considered output mode .",
    "in contrast to the above single - mode counting statistics , _ distinct _ many - particle amplitudes contribute to the coherent sum in ( [ expval ] ) when _ several _ output modes are correlated , and give rise to characteristic many - particle interference effects beyond the smooth bunching observed in fig .",
    "[ onesite ] . for",
    "these interference effects to fully develop , we need to propagate the many - particle state over a larger number of steps ( n=20 ) , such that all single particle wave functions spread over the entire lattice , and mode - to - mode correlations can build up .",
    "our figure of merit is then the conditional probability @xmath49 to find @xmath50 particles in mode @xmath51 , with a total of @xmath52 particles in these modes . indeed , as evident in fig .",
    "[ twomodecut ] , many - particle interference of indistinguishable particles has a marked impact on @xmath53 as compared to the case of distinguishable ones .",
    "while the latter always implies a single - peaked dependence of @xmath53 on the particle imbalance @xmath54 , many - particle interference manifests in strong modulations of @xmath53 for bosons , with pronounced maxima for even values of @xmath55 , i.e. for odd particle numbers in either one of both modes ( remember that n=8 ) .",
    "furthermore , the many - particle interference condition is strongly affected by the specific choice of the output modes i and j , as obvious from a comparison of figs .",
    "[ twomodecut]a ) and b ) : an asymmetric choice of i and j with respect to the lattice center induces a strong asymmetry in @xmath56 . what s more , the interference signal sensitively depends on the total number of particles",

    "[ twomodecut ]  c ) , where the bosonic signal is shown for different n. this allows for a clear distinction of multi - particle interference contributions of different order .",
    "when not all particles contribute to the signal in modes i and j , i.e. for @xmath57 , many of the events which contribute to @xmath58 can be distinguished by the final positions of the remaining @xmath59 particles and thus can not interfere anymore , what leads to a smoother dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath60 .",

    "many more incoherently added terms contribute , and , thus , interference effects are averaged out .     among two modes after n=20 steps of n=8 particles , for lattice size 2l=50 , conditioned on finding m=4 or 8 particles .",

    "[ twomodecutmean ] shows that the bosonic signal is markedly different from the classical result , after a given number of steps as well as in its dependence on n. while the two - mode correlation is single - peaked and essentially n-_independent _ for distinguishable particles , some of the interference structure of fig .",

    "note that while the distribution is essentially invariant under changes of n for distinguishable particles , the correlations fluctuate with n , in the bosonic case.,width=302 ]",
    "in summary , many - particle interferences between n indistinguishable particles injected into the 2l input modes of a beam splitter array give rise to strong bunching effects in the single mode counting statistics , as well as to a robust , pronounced and non - monotonic dependence of the two - mode correlation function on total particle number and particle imbalance between both modes .",
    "the many - particle interference correction induces large deviations from the classical ( distinguishable particle ) result .",
    "this allows to characterise the witnessed interference phenomenon in terms of the number of contributing particles - an information unaccessible , e.g. , in few - particle quantum walks .",
    "this is of particular interest , e.g. , in the many - particle transport across disordered media @xcite , which is also covered by our central result , eq .",
