    "much of the recent interest in the behavior of fluids in small channels stems from the wide range of applications that microfluidic devices are finding in biology and chemistry .",
    "the laminar regime of the flow in these systems allows an accurate control of mass and momentum transport , such that chemical species can be brought together in small quantities within restricted regions of space , enabling , for example , fast mixing  @xcite and high resolution of reaction kinetics  @xcite . in the case of two  phase systems , nano and pico ",
    "liter droplets can be handled with great precision when the destabilizing effects of wall impurities can be suppressed , producing well controlled structures  @xcite ; partial wetting , in fact , introduces non - linear instabilities which may generate complex erratic @xcite or oscillatory patterns  @xcite .",
    "the variety of two  phase flow behaviors ( see figure [ fig : devices ] ) is both interesting at a fundamental level and relevant for those applications based on the accurate tuning of droplet sizes  @xcite : micro  droplets could , for example , be used to confine chemical reactions , or to deliver substances in well defined amounts .",
    "such a control is generally attainable for a limited range of flow conditions and with fluids having properties that are compatible with the surfaces of the device used .",
    "the combinations of materials , geometries and flow conditions which are being used in experimental setups are rapidly growing , and modeling can be extremely helpful both in providing insight and in improving the design and prototyping of microfluidic devices . in this respect ,",
    "the main challenge of a modeling technique is to cope with the three  dimensionality and the strong surface stresses present both at the fluid  fluid and fluid  solid interfaces .    phase  field models have been developed for the study of the dynamics of critical phenomena , in particular in relation to nucleation and spinodal decomposition  @xcite .",
    "the spatial variations of the phase order parameter indicate the location of interfaces separating the growing domains , and interface coalescence and breakup is driven by the local curvature  dependent solubility ( gibbs  thomson effect ) : interfacial regions of high curvature have a higher chemical potential which drives a mass flux to the surrounding medium to reduce the curvature and therefore the chemical potential gradients .",
    "the effects of fluid flow are included by adding an advection term to the diffusion equation of the order parameter , which is then coupled to a momentum transport equation to describe the hydrodynamics of a multiphase system  @xcite . from a computational point of view",
    ", modeling of fluid boundaries as having finite thickness greatly simplifies the handling of interface coalescence or breakup events , and in the case of phenomena occurring near the critical point , this approach is fully justified by the fact that , in the mean field approximation , interfaces are indeed diffuse , with a characteristic length which is comparable with the typical domain size . on the other hand",
    ", it can be shown that phase ",
    "field physics approaches asymptotically that of two immiscible fluids as the interface thickness becomes small compared to the local curvature , both for unbounded flow and in the presence of solid surfaces  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use a phase  field model to study the three  dimensional flow of a binary mixture in constrained geometries in the hydrodynamic regime which characterizes the flow in microfluidic devices , i.e. with low reynolds and capillary numbers ; we show how the computed droplet flow and breakup dynamics in a t  shaped junction follows closely that observed experimentally for water in oil mixtures , despite the fact that the interface thickness in the simulations is far from the sharp  interface limit .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section [ sec : model ] summarizes how the thermodynamic and transport properties of the non  homogeneous system can be derived from a free  energy functional ; section [ sec : method ] describes the numerical method used to solve the transport equations while section [ sec : free_flow ] presents the free  flow tests which were performed to validate the implementation of the code .",
    "finally , in sections [ sec : channels ] and [ sec : tjunction ] the results for the modeling of droplet flow and breakup in a t  shaped junction are reported .",
    "a unifying feature of all phase  field models is the existence of a free  energy functional , which , besides determining the equilibrium properties , strongly influences the dynamics of the system , whose transport equations can be derived from conservation arguments  @xcite , or from generalized hydrodynamic theory  @xcite . in this section",

    "<S> a phase  field method is applied to the modeling of flow and breakup of droplets in a t  shaped junction in the hydrodynamic regime where capillary and viscous stresses dominate over inertial forces , which is characteristic of microfluidic devices . </S>",
    "<S> the transport equations are solved numerically in the three  dimensional geometry , and the dependence of the droplet breakup on the flow rates , surface tension and viscosities of the two components is investigated in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces quite accurately the phase diagram observed in experiments performed with immiscible fluids . </S>",
    "<S> the critical capillary number for droplet breakup depends on the viscosity contrast , with a trend which is analogous to that observed for free isolated droplets in hyperbolic flow . </S>"
