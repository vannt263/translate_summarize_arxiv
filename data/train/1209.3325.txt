    "blazars are a class of agn in which non - thermal continuum emission is relativistically beamed into our line of sight , rendering them extremely bright across many wavebands at cosmological distances .",
    "s50716@xmath0714 is one of the most extensively studied blazars in the sky .",
    "it belongs to the bllacertae object ( bllac ) subclass of blazars , which are known for their smooth non - thermal continua without clear emission lines .",
    "this lack of identifying spectral features makes the source redshifts , and hence the physical characteristics of these astrophysically interesting objects , very challenging to determine unambiguously .",
    "spectroscopically , s50716@xmath0714 was first studied in the optical band by @xcite who found a completely featureless spectrum .",
    "no emission or absorption lines were ever identified in this source , despite several attempts @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected an excess in the point spread function of s50716@xmath0714 which is consistent with a host galaxy at @xmath12 .",
    "this range is consistent with the @xcite identification of a pair of galaxies near the sight line at @xmath13 , suggesting that the host is part of a galaxy group .",
    "detection of s50716@xmath0714 in very - high - energy ( vhe ) gamma - rays by the magic telescope led to different upper limits on the source redshift : @xmath14 @xcite , and @xmath15 @xcite , though these depend on the poorly - characterized cosmic infrared background .",
    "blazars are also known for variability . even amongst blazars ,",
    "s50716@xmath0714 is well known for its strong and persistent optical variability with a duty cycle of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "intraday variability ( idv ) is routinely measured in this source with the reported maximum variability rates of @xmath17 magnitudes per hour @xcite to as high as @xmath18 magnitudes per hour @xcite .",
    "an extensive statistical analysis by @xcite showed that variability rates of order @xmath19 usually last for no more than two hours , and their duty cycle is only a few percent .",
    "asymmetric flares , with the increase rate on average faster than the decline rate , were found by @xcite and @xcite , see , however , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations were claimed over short time intervals with various periods : @xmath20 day and @xmath21 days @xcite , @xmath22 days @xcite , and even as fast as @xmath23 minutes @xcite .",
    "bllac objects are extremely useful as probes of intervening material .",
    "high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) optical and ultraviolet spectral observations are possible if the blazar is observed during a bright state",
    ". their smooth , power - law continua make it possible to detect weak , broad absorption features .",

    "( hst / cos ; @xcite ) .",
    "the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectrum of s50716@xmath0714 provides an excellent dataset relevant to igm cosmology which will be presented as part of a much larger study of the low - redshift igm ( danforth et  al .",
    "2013 , in prep ) .",
    "we present here two serendipitous discoveries from the s50716@xmath0714 observations .",
    "first , our five - orbit hst observations happened to observe a fast , asymmetric flare during which the blazar brightened by @xmath24 and then faded to approximately the flux level at the start of our observations .",
    "we discuss the flare and changes to the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in section  3 .",
    "second , in section  4 , we use the observed intervening absorption systems ( the ly@xmath8  forest ) along the sight line to place the first direct constraints on the source redshift of s50716@xmath0714 .",
    "we discuss and summarize our results in section  5 .",
    "s50716@xmath0714 was observed with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on december 27 , 2011 , as part of hst program 12025 ( pi : green ) .",
    "two exposures were made during each of five hst orbits over the course of 7.3 hours ; the first five exposures with the g130 m ( @xmath25  , 6.00 ksec ) grating , the second five with the g160 m ( @xmath26  , 8.25 ksec ) grating .",
    "the ten exposures were obtained from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) and reprocessed with a recent version of calcos ( 2.17.3a ) .",
    "the calibrated , one - dimensional spectra were next coadded with the custom idl procedures described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we present the coadded cos spectrum of s50716@xmath0714 in figure  [ fig : overview ] ( however , see the cautions regarding coaddition of a strongly varying source in section  3.1 . )",
    "a voigt profile fit to the galactic ly@xmath8  profile in the g130 m data gives a column density of @xmath27 .",
    "this corresponds to a color excess of @xmath28 and we deredden all observed fluxes via @xcite% larger than the extinction value derived from the low - resolution @xcite dust maps . ] .",
    "many agn show some degree of variability between one epoch and another and our coaddition software automatically scales exposures from different epochs to correct this ( usually minor ) effect .",
    "however , during coaddition of the s50716@xmath0714 data , it was noticed that the mean flux varied by as much as 35% during the course of 7.3 hours .",
    "cos is a photon - counting instrument ; the arrival time of each photon is recorded as well as the two - dimensional position on the detector .",
    "it is therefore possible to extract very high resolution ( @xmath6 ms ) time - domain data @xcite .",
    "we extract an [ @xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 photon list from each exposure @xmath32 and coadd these to create a master [ @xmath33,@xmath34,@xmath35 photon list .",
    "the total number of counts in a [ @xmath36@xmath33,@xmath36@xmath34 ] box is integrated over a timestep @xmath38 .",
    "we use a timestep of @xmath39  s for s50716@xmath0714 to balance time - resolution with reasonable photometric precision .",
    "continuum count rates are extracted over @xmath6 ( 37 )    integration regions for the g130 m ( g160 m ) grating at four nominal far - uv wavelengths ( @xmath40  ] and @xmath41  ] in g130 m ; @xmath42  ] and @xmath43  ] in g160 m ) .",
    "narrow interstellar and intergalactic absorption lines are present in the data ( see figure  [ fig : overview ] ) , however these features only remove a small number of photons relative to the bright continuum emission on 30    scales , therefore ignoring narrow absorbers does not significantly impact the photometry produced here . the instrumental background is computed in a similar manner , with extraction boxes offset below the active science region of the detector .",
    "the instrumental background contributes @xmath44 of the total photons measured in each extraction region .",
    "so that photometry from the blue g130 m and red g160 m gratings can be compared , flux - callibrated spectra for each exposure ( @xmath45 min ) are fitted with a power law of the form @xmath46 normalized at @xmath47  , a wavelength covered by both gratings .",
    "raw light curves in units of counts @xmath48 are extracted in the wavelengths intervals defined above and in 2-min time intervals .",
    "flux calibrated light curves at @xmath49 are obtained by dividing the raw light curves by exposure - averaged count rates in the same wavelengths intervals , and by multiplying them by @xmath50 .",
    "the result is a nearly - continuous , flux - calibrated light curve for s50716@xmath0714 ( figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] ) at 1400  , interupted only by four periods of earth occultation .",
    "henceforth , all times are quoted in hours starting from mjd55922 ( 0:00ut on december 27 , 2011 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the strong source variability during our five - orbit ( @xmath51 ) hst observing period ; the blazar brightened by a factor of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) before fading to very nearly the initial intensity .",
    "most dramatically , the source showed a monotonic flux increase of @xmath54 during @xmath55 , with the average variability rate of @xmath2 during the second orbit . during the third orbit",
    ", we observed a quasi - monotonic flux decrease of @xmath56 over @xmath57 , with an average variability rate of @xmath3 .",
    "even though there are gaps in our light curve due to earth occultation , the variability appears to be fairly simple .",
    "hence , we model the light curve with a constant background flux level @xmath58 and a single flare template which is described by a function @xmath59 with four parameters : flare normalization @xmath60 , flux raising time scale @xmath61 , flux decay time scale @xmath62 , and epoch @xmath63 corresponding roughly to the flare maximum @xcite . this model",
    "a is shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] , and its parameters are reported in table  1 .",
    "the fit quality is mediocre ( @xmath64 and the largest residuals are observed during the late stage of the flare .",
    "hence , we consider a more detailed model  b , which includes a second flare template .",
    "this model provides a substantial improvement in the fit quality ( @xmath65 , and the remaining residuals do not show any long - term structure .",
    "the main difference in the main flare parameters in model  b , compared to model  a , are higher flare amplitude @xmath66 and shorter flux decay time scale @xmath67 .",
    "the background flux level @xmath58 , flux raising time scale @xmath68 , and the moment of peak flux @xmath69 are consistent between models a and b. the second flare template @xmath70 of model  b has poorly constrained characteristic time scales ; in particular , the very fast decay time @xmath71 is almost entirely determined by the final 120  s bin at the end of the fourth orbit . in section 5 , we discuss the physical implications of the main flare parameters .",
    "ccc @xmath72&@xmath73&@xmath74 + @xmath75&@xmath76&@xmath77 + @xmath78&@xmath79&@xmath80 + @xmath81&@xmath82&@xmath83 + @xmath84&@xmath85&@xmath86 + @xmath87 & & @xmath88 + @xmath89 & & @xmath90 + @xmath91 & & @xmath92 + @xmath93 & & @xmath94 + @xmath95 & 5.1 & 3.2 +      broad spectral coverage allows us to monitor any changes in the spectral index of s50716@xmath0714 .",
    "though the spectral `` throw '' of any individual observation is relatively small ( @xmath96 ) , they show significantly different spectral indices during the course of the hst observations .",
    "we convert our measured @xmath97 values ( section  2 ) to the more conventional @xmath98 via the relationship @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the sed softens monatonically at the rate of @xmath100 from @xmath101 at the beginning of the observation to @xmath102 near the flare maximum to @xmath103 at the end of the observation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] .",
    "this trend is consistent with measured flux ratios from the blue and red ends of each spectral range .",
    "the highest - quality spectra can often be obtained by scaling the individual exposures and coadding them onto a common wavelength scale .",
    "however , the significant change in the spectral index of s50716@xmath0714 during the observations makes any sed derived from the combined observations suspect . combining just the observations in the same far - uv waveband produce slopes of @xmath104 and @xmath105 for g130 m and g160 m channel coadditions , respectively ( dotted horizontal lines in figure  [ fig : alpha ] ) .",
    "both slope values are typical of those of the individual observations , but we caution against trying to determine an overall sed from the combined far - uv observations .",
    "determining the source redshift of featureless agn can be difficult , especially at higher redshift where the host galaxy can not be easily identified .",
    "redshift limits can be inferred through indirect means ( host galaxy non - detection , gamma ray emission , etc . ) . a direct lower limit to the source redshift can be determined through intermediate absorption lines in moderate - resolution data ( usually in the uv ) .",
    "an automated line - finding algorithm ( danforth et  al .  2013 , in prep ) finds @xmath6 intervening ly@xmath8  absorption systems detected to greater than @xmath106 significance in the cos spectrum of s50716@xmath0714 .",
    "figures  1 and 4 show the observed cos spectral range with detected ly@xmath8  systems along the top edge in both wavelength and redshift space .",
    "the reddest of these lines is at 1497  , corresponding to @xmath107 , and is confirmed by corresponding detections in higher - order lyman lines ( ly@xmath9 , ly@xmath108 ) as well as metal ions ( , ) thus setting a firm lower limit on the redshift of s50716@xmath0714 .",
    "the remaining spectral range ( @xmath109 ; @xmath110 ) is devoid of ly@xmath8  absorption to a @xmath106 limiting equivalent width of @xmath111 m  ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "this technique was first used in @xcite to constrain the upper redshift limit of 1es1553@xmath0113 and we refine the methodology here .",
    "we calculate the expected density of intervening ly@xmath8  systems per unit redshift , @xmath113 ( shaded curve in figure  [ fig : zrange ] ) . the minimum column density absorber that can be detected at a @xmath114 level is predicted based on the s / n in the data @xcite and the @xmath115  at that limiting column is drawn from the large , low - redshift igm surveys of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume no evolution in the ly@xmath8  forest over this small redshift , but including a modest evolution produces negligible changes in the predicted absorber distribution .",
    "the overall density of absorbers toward s50716@xmath0714 ( black data points ) follows the predicted density consistently though with variations in individual redshift bins most likely due to cosmic variance .    to constrain the upper limit on source redshift , we truncate the predicted @xmath115  distribution at a range of redshifts and compare this modeled absorber distribution to the observed distribution using a k - s test .",
    "s50716@xmath0714 can be constrained to @xmath116 ( 68% confidence ) , @xmath117 ( 95% ) , or @xmath118 ( 99.7% ) .",
    "weak ly@xmath8  emission is occasionally seen from low - redshift bllac objects @xcite and is an unambiguous , direct way of determining the redshift of blazars to high precision .",
    "the only deviations from a smooth power - law continuum seen in the coadded g160 m data are likely artifacts produced by the coadding individual exposures with rapidly changing spectral index and none is convincing as ly@xmath8  emission at @xmath119 .",
    "we set a @xmath120 upper limit of @xmath121 ( @xmath122  m ) by measuring the equivalent width detection limit @xcite for an emission feature with fwhm@xmath123    in the rest frame ( typical of those seen by stocke et  al .  in mrk421 ,",
    "pks2005@xmath124489 and mrk501 ) .",
    "this intensity limit translates to an isotropic luminosity of @xmath125 .",
    "all three ly@xmath8  emission detections at low-@xmath126 in @xcite are considerably below this level , so this is not a terribly constraining upper limit . furthermore , high-@xmath126 agn ( of any sort ) have been observed with luminosities as low as @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "we obtained the most sensitive , highest - resolution far - uv spectroscopic observation of s50716@xmath0714 to date .",
    "the precise source redshift remains unknown .",
    "however , the detection of narrow ly@xmath8  forest features enables the determination of a new , independent constraint  @xmath128 at a @xmath129 confidence level .",
    "this redshift range is consistent with the result of @xcite , @xmath12 , based on the photometric detection of the host galaxy as well as the intriguing possibility that s50716@xmath0714 is associated with a group of nearby galaxies observed at redshift @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "we note that the uncertainty in our estimate is based on the statistical properties of the low - redshift ly@xmath8  forest along many sight lines , while the uncertainty of the @xcite estimate is based on the statistics of the host galaxy luminosities for bllacs .",
    "our source redshift estimate is also consistent with the upper limit @xmath131 obtained by @xcite from modeling the source sed at vhe gamma - rays and also with the @xmath14 estimate of @xcite .",
    "our observations of s50716@xmath0714 coincided with a period of rapid flux variability .",
    "this is not surprising , since this source is well known for almost uninterrupted variability at multiple time scales .",
    "we detected episodes of very fast variability rate , up to @xmath132 .",
    "this is higher than the maximum observed variability rate found in the most extensive study of idv in this source @xcite , but comparable to the variability rate found by @xcite during one night out of five . it seems that such fast variability rates are limited to periods of a fraction of an hour .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the general trend that faster variability rates last for shorter time intervals ( see figure  7 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is also known that the frequency of light curve segments with constant variability rate decreases exponentially with increasing variability rate .",
    "this would indicate rapid flares such as the one we observed with hst / cos , while spectacular , are probably not important in the overall source energetics .",
    "however , the study of @xcite uses much longer sampling rates , and to obtain a statistical picture of intra - hour variability of this blazar one needs a much larger sample of high - cadence observations .",
    "the decomposition of the observed light curve of s50716@xmath0714 into a coherent flaring component and a quasi - static background ( model  b , above ) allows us to constrain the physics of the emitting region producing the flare .",
    "the rise time of the flare , @xmath133 , indicates the emitting region radius @xmath134 ( for @xmath130 ) , where @xmath135 is the doppler factor of the emitting region .",
    "the flux decay time constrains the cooling time scale @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the co - moving energy density of the magnetic field ( determining the synchrotron cooling rate ) plus the diffuse radiation ( determining the inverse - compton cooling rate ) , @xmath138 is the compton dominance parameter ( which for bl lacs is of order of unity ) , and @xmath139 is the characteristic random lorentz factor of electrons producing the observed fuv emission .",
    "since the fuv continuum emission is produced by the synchrotron process , we use the expression for the observed frequency of the synchrotron radiation , @xmath140 to eliminate @xmath139 and obtain an estimate of the magnetic field strength in the emitting region @xmath141^{1/3}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times[(1+q)t_{\\rm d,1}]^{-2/3 } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & 2\\;{\\rm g}\\times\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{d}}{10}\\right)^{-1/3}(1+q)^{-2/3}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left(\\frac{\\nu_{\\rm syn , obs}}{c/1400\\;{\\rm\\aa}}\\right)^{-1/3}\\left(\\frac{t_{\\rm d,1}}{1.28\\;{\\rm h}}\\right)^{-2/3}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath142^{1/3}\\nu_{\\rm syn , obs}^{2/3 } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & 5300\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{d}}{10}\\right)^{-1/3}(1+q)^{1/3}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\left(\\frac{\\nu_{\\rm syn , obs}}{c/1400\\;{\\rm\\aa}}\\right)^{2/3}\\left(\\frac{t_{\\rm d,1}}{1.28\\;{\\rm h}}\\right)^{1/3}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the apparent flare luminosity is @xmath143 we use it to estimate the co - moving energy density of the synchrotron radiation @xmath144 in a typical bl lac , one can neglect the external radiation , and thus the total energy density of the diffuse radiation is @xmath145 . using the estimate for @xmath146",
    ", we can write a direct relation between the compton dominance parameter and the doppler factor : @xmath147 we can further use the apparent flare luminosity to estimate the number of electrons contributing to the fuv emission @xmath148 and their co - moving energy density @xmath149    the ratio of the co - moving electron to synchrotron energy density is thus @xmath150 the fact that @xmath151 is the consequence of @xmath152 . since we assumed that @xmath153 ( observed cooling time scale ) and @xmath154 ( observed light crossing time scale ) , the ratio of @xmath155 is in fact determined by the ratio of @xmath156 .",
    "if we assume equipartition between electrons and the magnetic field , @xmath157 @xcite , we will obtain a very large doppler factor , @xmath158 , and a very small compton dominance parameter @xmath159 .",
    "such a scenario poses a severe problem of explaining the extremely efficient acceleration of the emitting region , but it predicts a negligible gamma - ray signature of the fuv flare via the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) mechanism .",
    "if we instead assume that @xmath160 , we will still require a large doppler factor , @xmath161 , but also a strong departure from the equipartition , with @xmath162 . it should be noted that gamma - ray emission was detected in s50716@xmath0714 by magic @xcite , agile @xcite and _ fermi _ at the level of @xmath163 . hence , the compton dominance parameter @xmath164 can not be much larger than unity and some extreme physical parameter of the emitting region producing the fast fuv flare is unavoidable .",
    "this makes our case of a fast fuv flare similar to the fast gamma - ray flares observed in other bllacs ( pks2155@xmath124304 , @xcite ; mrk501 , @xcite ) and one fsrq ( pks1222@xmath0216 , @xcite ) .",
    "they also seem to require extremely high doppler factors @xcite , and a number of theoretical scenarios were proposed to explain them @xcite . in the case of s50716@xmath0714 , we can not constrain the distance of the emitting region from the central black hole , and thus we have greater freedom of theoretical scenarios than in the case of pks1222@xmath0216 @xcite .",
    "we observed strong spectral variability with the systematic spectral index change of @xmath165 over the course of @xmath166 .",
    "strong intraday spectral variations in the optical / uv band is rarely reported .",
    "for example , @xcite found the @xmath167 color to vary with the amplitude of @xmath168 within an hour .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath169 , which means a significantly faster variability rate .",
    "however , we have found no case of a systematic spectral index variation over several hours .",
    "spectroscopic observations of blazars are proving to be versatile tool with which to study a range of astrophysical processes from galactic structure to cosmology to the study of agn processes .",
    "our observations of s50716@xmath0714 illustrate the power of time - domain sensitivity as well .",
    "not only is the cosmic origins spectrograph the most sensitive far - uv spectroscopic instrument ever flown , but the temporal resolution can be exploited to look for microvariability on very short time scales .",
    "a number of other blazars have been observed with hst / cos as part of a larger program on low - redshift cosmology .",
    "many cover only a short time period ( 1 - 3 hst orbits ) , but those with similar 5-orbit observations do not show appreciable variability .",
    "we will continue to both look for notable variability in agn observations and to determine the source redshifts of poorly - constrained blazars through spectroscopy of their intervening absorbers .",
