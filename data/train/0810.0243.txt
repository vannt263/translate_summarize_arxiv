    "in gravity models , metric components are usually considered as continuous and two times differentiable functions .",
    "this property is needed for unambiguous calculation of curvature tensor components . in a general case , if metric components are not continuous , then christoffel s symbols contain @xmath0-function , and curvature tensor will include squares of @xmath0-functions , which can not be unambiguously defined",
    ". however , there may exist rare particular cases when all ambiguous terms in einstein s equations cancel .",
    "this means that if we regularize the corresponding discontinuous metric components by smooth functions , then the solution of einstein s equations will not depend on a regularization .",
    "this situation is acceptable and worth to be analyzed .",
    "it may happen when einstein s equations reduce to one or a system of _ linear _ differential equations for a specific combinations of metric components .",
    "for example , it is well known that einstein s equations reduce to the linear inhomogeneous poisson equation for the conformal factor of the two dimensional part of the metric for a cosmic string @xcite . the corresponding metric components ( or its inverse ) in cartesian coordinates on a plane are singular at the location of conical singularity .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider tube dislocations in space - time which correspond to a matter distributed uniformly along static straight circular tubes which are infinitely thin .",
    "there are two types of tube defects with the energy - momentum tensor proportional to the @xmath0-function or its derivative , respectively . in the first case ,",
    "the space - time has conical singularity either inside or outside the tube , while in the second case , the space - time has no conical singularities .",
    "thin shells are well known in general relativity for continuous metric components @xcite . for these types of metrics , christoffel s symbols and the curvature tensor may have jumps and @xmath0-functions , respectively . then einstein s equations",
    "yield the matching conditions on the shell in terms of extrinsic curvature .",
    "we consider a different situation when metric components have jumps but all ambiguous terms in einstein s equations cancel .",
    "we start the analysis and derive the metric for the tube dislocation within the static linear elasticity theory because this approach clarifies a lot the whole construction .",
    "we show that the metric for a tube dislocation satisfies einstein s equations with the @xmath1 source .",
    "then we consider this problem within the geometric theory of defects developed in @xcite ( for review see @xcite , the combined wedge and edge dislocation was considered in @xcite ) and generalize the metric to four dimensions .",
    "afterwards , we consider conical tube dislocation and asymptotically flat wedge dislocation .",
    "the first one is flat in the inside region and conical outside , whereas the second is conical inside and flat outside .",
    "these dislocations have a @xmath0-function source . at the end",
    ", we consider an arbitrary continuous distribution of tube dislocations .",
    "we consider a three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 ( infinite homogeneous and isotropic elastic media or eather in general relativity ) with cartesian coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the euclidean metric is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the basic variable in the elasticity theory is the displacement vector field @xmath6 , @xmath7 , which measures the displacement of a point in the elastic media . in the absence of external forces ,",
    "newton s and hook s laws reduce to three second order partial differential equations which describe the equilibrium state of elastic media ( see , i.e.  @xcite ) , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dimensionless poisson ratio , ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 is the laplace operator .",
    "the lame coefficients @xmath12 characterize the elastic properties of media . raising and lowering of latin indices @xmath13",

    "a_.     negative ( _ a _ ) and positive ( _ b _ ) tube dislocations.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    this dislocation is produced as follows .",
    "we cut out the thick cylinder of media located between two parallel cylinders of radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) with axis @xmath19 as the axis of both cylinders , move symmetrically both cutting surfaces one to the other and afterwards glue them . in the equilibrium state ,",
    "the gluing surface is also the cylinder , due to circular and translational symmetries of the problem , of radius @xmath20 which is to be found .    in our conventions ,",
    "fig.[ftubes],_a _ shows the negative tube dislocation because part of the media was removed , @xmath18 .",
    "this procedure can be inverted by addition of extra media to @xmath2 as shown in fig.[ftubes],_b_. in this case , we call it positive tube dislocation , @xmath21 .",
    "this problem is naturally formulated and solved in cylindrical coordinates @xmath22 .",
    "let us denote the displacement field components in cylindrical coordinates by @xmath23 . in our case",
    ", @xmath24 , @xmath25 , due to the symmetry of the problem , and the radial displacement field , @xmath26 , depends only on the radius @xmath27 , and we drop the index , @xmath28 , for simplicity .",
    "the boundary conditions for the tube dislocation are @xmath29 the first two conditions are purely geometrical , and the third one means the equality of normal elastic forces inside and outside the gluing surface in the equilibrium state .",
    "the subscripts `` in '' and `` ex '' denote the displacement vector field inside and outside the gluing surface , respectively .",
    "our definition of the displacement vector field differs slightly from the usual one . in our notations ,",
    "the point with coordinates @xmath30 after elastic deformation moves to the point with coordinates @xmath31 : @xmath32 the displacement vector field being the difference between new and old coordinates , @xmath33 ( this is usual ) .",
    "the difference is that we consider the components of the displacement vector field @xmath6 as functions of the final state coordinates of media points @xmath31 and not of the initial ones @xmath30 .",
    "this is equivalent to the standard approach in the absence of dislocations because both sets of coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath30 cover the entire euclidean space @xmath2 .",
    "if the dislocation is present , the final state coordinates @xmath31 cover the whole @xmath2 while the initial state coordinates cover only part of the euclidean space lying outside the thick cylinder which was removed",
    ". therefore the final state coordinates are preferable in the presence of dislocations .",
    "this difference can be considered as inessential in the linear approximation but the geometric theory of defects describes large deformations along with the small ones .",
    "the elasticity equations ( [ eqsepu ] ) can be easily solved in the considered case of tube dislocation .",
    "the laplacian of the radial component , which is the only one that differs from zero , and the divergence in the cylindrical coordinates have the form : @xmath34 where the indices are lowered using the euclidean metric in cylindrical coordinates : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the angular @xmath38 and @xmath39 components of equations ( [ eqsepu ] ) are identically satisfied , and the radial component reduces to the ordinary differential equation , @xmath40=0,\\ ] ] which has a general solution @xmath41 depending on two arbitrary constants of integration @xmath42 and @xmath43 . due to the first two boundary conditions ( [ ebotud ] ) , the solutions inside and outside the gluing surface are @xmath44 the signs of the integration constants correspond to the negative tube dislocation shown in fig.[ftubes],_a_. for positive tube dislocation , fig.[ftubes],_b _ , the integration constants have different signs , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the third boundary condition ( [ ebotud ] ) determines the radius of the gluing surface , @xmath47 after simple algebra the integration constants can be expressed through the radii @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the thickness of the removed cylinder and the radius of the gluing surface , respectively .",
    "the first expression in ( [ eintco ] ) restricts the range of the integration constant , @xmath50 . for negative and positive tube dislocations , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we see that the gluing surface lies exactly in the middle between radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "so , eq.([elsopt ] ) with integration constants ( [ eintco ] ) yields a complete solution for the tube dislocation within the linear elasticity theory .",
    "we expect it to be valid for small relative displacements : @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "note that the answer within the linear elasticity theory does not depend on the poisson ratio of the media . in this sense ,",
    "the tube dislocation is a purely geometric defect which does not feel the elastic properties .",
    "now we compute the geometric quantities of the manifold corresponding to the tube dislocation . from the geometric point of view , the elastic deformation ( [ eeldef ] ) is a diffeomorphism between given domains in the euclidean space .",
    "the original elastic media @xmath2 , before the dislocation is made , is described by cartesian coordinates @xmath30 with the euclidean metric @xmath14 .",
    "the pull back of a diffeomorphism @xmath55 induces nontrivial metric on @xmath2 corresponding to the tube dislocation . in cartesian",
    "coordinates it has the form @xmath56 we use curvilinear cylindrical coordinates for the tube dislocation and therefore modify our notations .",
    "let us denote indices in curvilinear coordinates in the euclidean space @xmath2 by greek letters @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "then the `` induced '' metric for the tube dislocation in cylindrical coordinates is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the euclidean metric written in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we denote cylindrical coordinates of a point before the dislocation is made by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 without any index stands for the radial coordinate and we take into account that angular @xmath38 and @xmath39 coordinates are not changed",
    ". then the diffeomorphism is described by a single function relating old and new radial coordinates of a point @xmath63 , where @xmath64 this function has the jump @xmath65 across the cut and hence is not continuous .",
    "therefore a special care must be taken in calculation of the induced metric components . to this end",
    "we introduce the function @xmath66 which is continuous across the cutting surface .",
    "this function differs from the derivative with respect to @xmath27 of the displacement vector field @xmath67 defined in ( [ edifun ] ) by the @xmath0-function @xmath68 the induced metric outside the cut is given by expression ( [ eincym ] ) and is not defined on the cutting surface .",
    "therefore , _ we define _ the metric for the tube dislocation as @xmath69 with the volume element @xmath70 metric ( [ eindum ] ) differs from the formal substitution of @xmath63 in the euclidean metric @xmath71 by the square of the @xmath0-function in the @xmath72 component .",
    "this procedure is a must in the geometric theory of defects , because otherwise the burgers vector can not be expressed as the surface integral @xcite .",
    "so , the metric component @xmath73 of tube dislocation is a continuous function , and the angular component @xmath74 has the jump across the cut .",
    "thus we solved linear elasticity field equations ( [ eqsepu ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ ebotud ] ) describing the tube dislocation .",
    "the displacement vector field ( [ edifun ] ) and , consequently , induced metric ( [ eindum ] ) do not depend on the elastic properties of media characterized by a poisson ratio .",
    "this demonstrates the universality of the problem .",
    "now we calculate geometric quantities for the tube dislocation .",
    "the components of the metric are not differentiable functions , and hence the calculation of geometric quantities involving derivatives and multiplications is an ambiguous procedure .",
    "therefore , we perform all calculations as if the components were sufficiently smooth functions and see that all ambiguous terms safely cancel in the final answer .",
    "it means that whatever regularization of the components is applied the final answer does not depend on it .",
    "now we calculate christoffel s symbols : @xmath75 only four components of christoffel s symbols differ from zero , @xmath76(r - u ) , \\\\",

    "the ambiguous terms with the squares @xmath81 safely cancel .",
    "it is interesting and quite important that the prescription to drop the @xmath0-function from the @xmath72 component in the metric for a tube dislocation ( [ eindum ] ) which comes from physical considerations @xcite determines the right way for mathematical treatment of the calculation of the curvature .",
    "note also that if the @xmath0-function was not dropped then the curvature tensor would be identically zero because any diffeomorphism of the euclidean space @xmath2 leaves the curvature tensor equal to zero .",
    "we see that curvature ( [ ecurvt ] ) is zero everywhere except the cutting surface , as it must be both from physical and mathematical standpoints .",
    "the component of the curvature tensor ( [ ecurvt ] ) is still an ambiguous functions because the coefficient in front of @xmath1 and @xmath0-functions are not continuous .",
    "the ricci tensor has two nonvanishing components , @xmath82 , \\\\",
    "\\widetilde r_{\\vf\\vf}&=\\frac{l(r - u)}{(1-v)^2 }    \\left[{\\delta}'(r - r_*)+\\frac{v'}{1-v}{\\delta}(r - r_*)\\right ] .",

    "if components of a metric are not continuous functions , then the curvature tensor components will be not unambiguously defined , because they will have squares of the type @xmath91 and products of the step function with @xmath0-function .",
    "therefore , cancelation of all ambiguous terms in a geometric quantity is a big surprise . in the considered case ,",
    "christoffel s symbols and components of the curvature tensor are not well defined but the energy - momentum tensor is unambiguous .",
    "the same situation happens for a distribution of wedge dislocations with the same factor @xmath92 in the definition of the energy - momentum tensor density ( [ enmode ] ) @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath93 appears in einstein s equations ( [ enmode ] ) because @xmath0-function is not a function but a scalar density with respect to coordinate transformations .",
    "in this section we briefly formulate the geometric theory of defects developed in @xcite ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "this model treats defects in elastic media with a spin structure entirely within differential geometry . at the moment",
    "it is developed only for a static distribution of single defects as well as continuous distribution of dislocations and disclinations , the basic equations coinciding with equations of three - dimensional euclidean gravity with torsion .    in the geometric theory of defects",
    "we assume that elastic media is a three - dimensional manifold @xmath94 with a given riemann  cartan geometry . for simplicity , we consider topologically trivial manifold @xmath95 which is covered by an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the basic variables are the triad field @xmath96 and @xmath97-connection @xmath98 ( cartan variables ) .",
    "note that we do not have the displacement vector field @xmath6 as an independent variable .",
    "there is only geometry and nothing else in the geometric approach .",
    "the torsion and curvature tensors are @xmath99 these geometric notions are @xmath100-forms and have straightforward physical interpretation as the surface density of the burgers and frank vectors , respectively , characterizing distributions of dislocations and disclinations",
    ". if geometry is trivial , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then there are no defects in media .",
    "the nonzero torsion and curvature is the criteria for the presence of dislocations and disclinations , respectively .    for a given riemann ",
    "cartan geometry @xmath103 , we have , in fact , two connections on a manifold because , having the triad field at hand , we can compute the metric @xmath104 , where @xmath5 is the euclidean metric , and christoffel s symbols which define the second connection on @xmath94",
    ". the corresponding second @xmath97-connection can be expressed in terms of the triad field alone @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the anholonomicity coefficients and transformations of latin indices into greek ones are performed using the triad field and its inverse , @xmath107 .",

    "it corresponds to zero torsion and is the unique solution of the equation @xmath101 with respect to connection .",
    "this duality is well known in general relativity .",
    "usually , we solve einstein equations with respect to metric @xmath112 , compute christoffel s symbols @xmath113 , curvature tensor @xmath114 , and interpret gravity as nontrivial curvature of the space - time .",
    "the second alternative is to solve einstein s equations with respect to the tetrad field @xmath115 , assume that the curvature tensor of the space - time is identically zero @xmath102 ( the space of absolute parallelism ) , put the lorentz @xmath116-connection to zero ( this fixes the invariance with respect to local lorentz rotations ) , and compute the torsion tensor @xmath117 hence , gravity is interpreted as nontrivial torsion in a space with absolute parallelism .",
    "the invariance with respect to local lorentz rotations can be restored assuming that the lorentz connection is not zero but a pure gauge .",
    "the metric tensor is the same in both cases , and we always have two different geometric interpretations of any solution of einstein s equations .",
    "now we proceed with the geometric theory of defects .",
    "the equations of equilibrium for dislocations and disclinations follow from the expression for the free energy functional which was proposed in @xcite @xmath118,\\ ] ] where the first term is the hilbert ",
    "einstein action depending only on the triad field , @xmath119 is the antisymmetric part of the ricci tensor which is nonzero for nontrivial torsion , and @xmath120 is the source for dislocations ( the energy - momentum tensor density in general relativity ) . @xmath121 and @xmath122 are two coupling constants ( which are not determined yet , but do not alter the following calculations ) . if needed , the hilbert ",
    "einstein term in the action can be rewritten using the identity @xmath123 where @xmath124 , in terms of the the scalar curvature @xmath125 which depends on the triad field and @xmath97-connection and torsion squared terms .",
    "the equations of equilibrium following from the expression for a free energy ( [ eacfre ] ) are covariant and of second order for @xmath115 and @xmath111 .",
    "they define the triad field and @xmath97-connection up to general coordinate transformations and local rotations . to fix the solution uniquely , we must impose gauge conditions . in the geometric theory of defects",
    "we impose the elastic gauge to fix diffeomorphisms and the lorentz gauge for local rotations . to write these conditions as equations , we denote the triad , metric , christoffel s symbols and @xmath97-connection for the flat euclidean space @xmath2 in an arbitrary curvilinear but fixed coordinate system by @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "then the gauge conditions are first order differential equations @xcite , @xmath130 where the covariant derivative @xmath131 includes both christoffel s symbols @xmath128 and @xmath97-connection @xmath129 acting on greek and latin indices , and @xmath132 .",
    "these conditions are invariant with respect to coordinate transformations in the euclidean space @xmath2 but fix the solution of the equilibrium equations in these coordinates .",
    "for example , we can use cylindrical or spherical coordinates in @xmath2 depending on the problem . for a fixed coordinate system ,",
    "the gauge conditions ( [ efouad ] ) and ( [ elorog ] ) almost uniquely define the solution of covariant equations of equilibrium following from the action ( [ eacfre ] ) .",
    "in fact , some additional assumptions depending on the problem are needed for the unique definition , because gauge conditions themselves are differential equations . the examples which are considered later",
    "clarify the situation .",
    "the gauge conditions ( [ efouad ] ) , ( [ elorog ] ) have straightforward physical meaning @xcite and play a crucial role in the geometric theory of defects .",
    "suppose that defects are absent , that is , curvature and torsion are equal to zero : @xmath102 and @xmath101 .",
    "then the @xmath97-connection is locally a pure gauge @xmath133 and there is a vector field @xmath134 such that @xmath135 the functions @xmath134 describe a transformation to cartesian coordinates in the euclidean space @xmath2 .",
    "the orthogonal matrix @xmath136 can be parameterized by the rotational angle field @xmath137 describing the spin structure of media . in those domains of media where curvature and torsion vanish the media is described by the vector field @xmath134 and the rotational angle field @xmath138 .",
    "the equations of equilibrium following from the free energy expression ( [ eacfre ] ) are identically satisfied @xcite , and we are left only with the gauge conditions ( [ efouad ] ) , ( [ elorog ] ) for the vector field @xmath30 and rotational angle field @xmath138 . then the lorentz gauge ( [ elorog ] ) for the @xmath138 reduces to the principal chiral @xmath97-field model describing the spin structure of media @xcite . in the linear approximation with respect to the displacement vector field @xmath139 defined in ( [ eeldef ] ) , the triad field in cartesian coordinates can be chosen as @xmath140 and the elastic gauge ( [ efouad ] ) coincides with equations ( [ eqsepu ] ) of linear elasticity theory .",
    "equations ( [ efouad ] ) themselves are infinite power series in the displacement vector field @xmath139 of nonlinear elasticity theory .",
    "thus we chose two theories , nonlinear elasticity theory and principal chiral @xmath97-field model as the gauge conditions in the geometric theory of defects .",
    "this is in contrast with the main idea of general relativity which is to consider all coordinate systems as equivalent . in the geometric theory of defects , we have a preferred coordinate system defined by the elastic ( [ efouad ] ) and lorentz ( [ elorog ] ) gauge conditions .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the theory automatically contains all results obtained within the nonlinear elasticity theory for elastic deformations and principal chiral @xmath97-field model for the spin structure",
    ".    there is another important point . at present",
    ", there is no commonly acknowledged fundamental theory for continuous distribution of defects .",
    "a distribution of single dislocations can be described using the notion of the displacement vector field within the elasticity theory .",
    "this approach fails for description of continuous distribution of defects because the notion of the displacement vector field disappears and there is no reason to talk about any theory at all .",
    "the same happens with disclinations .",
    "indeed , for a distribution of single disclinations , the rotational angle field exists almost everywhere and we can use principal chiral @xmath97-field model for the spin structure ( or any other of the existing models ) . if disclinations are distributed continuously then the rotational angle field does not exist .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to define a model for continuous distribution of disclinations using the rotational angle field as a variable .    in the geometric theory of defects which pretends to be a fundamental one ,",
    "we start from the opposite point .",
    "we drop the notions of the displacement vector @xmath139 and rotational angle @xmath138 fields as the basic variables of the theory . instead , we choose the triad field @xmath115 and @xmath97-connection @xmath111 as the only independent variables and postulate covariant equations for them following from the variation of the action ( [ eacfre ] ) .",
    "these equations define a solution up to general coordinate transformations and local rotations .",
    "we choose two models to fix the solution uniquely : the nonlinear elasticity theory for elastic deformations and the principal chiral @xmath97-field model for the spin structure . and",
    "this is exactly what is needed .",
    "indeed , the purpose of elasticity theory is to find the displacement vector field .",
    "this field parameterizes diffeomorphisms and therefore fixes the coordinate system .",
    "similarly , the principal chiral @xmath97-field model defines the rotational angle field and hence fixes local rotations .",
    "though the models are present in the geometric theory of defects , they are rewritten in terms of the triad field and @xmath97-connection , and the notions of the displacement vector and rotational angle fields are still absent . for continuous distribution of defects",
    ", these fields can not be defined at all because the curvature and torsion differ from zero .",
    "the displacement vector and rotational angle fields can be defined only in those domains where curvature and torsion are zero , i.e. , defects are absent .",
    "if so , the equations of equilibrium following from the free energy ( [ eacfre ] ) are identically satisfied , and we are left with the old highly appreciated elasticity theory for elastic deformations @xcite and principal chiral @xmath97-field model for the spin structure @xcite .",
    "in this section we apply the geometric theory of defects for the description of tube dislocations . to this end",
    "we must solve equations of equilibrium following from the action ( [ eacfre ] ) in the coordinate system defined by the elastic ( [ efouad ] ) and lorentz ( [ elorog ] ) gauge conditions .",

    "the tube dislocation problem corresponds to elastic media without a spin structure and hence without disclinations . in this case , the curvature tensor is zero @xmath102 ( but not the @xmath142 ! ) , the equations of equilibrium obtained from ( [ eacfre ] ) by variation with respect to @xmath111 are identically satisfied , and we can safely put @xmath143 in the action ( [ eacfre ] ) . afterwards",

    "we are looking for classical solutions of this equation inside the cutting surface , @xmath179 , and outside it , @xmath180 , with the `` asymptotically flat '' boundary conditions : @xmath181 the boundary conditions at @xmath182 are the same as for the euclidean metric .",
    "moreover , on the cutting surface we impose the boundary conditions : @xmath183 the first matching condition provides the equality of the normal elastic forces .",
    "the second matching condition is the consequence of eq.([esolba ] ) and provides the jump of the @xmath173 component of the triad .",
    "boundary conditions ( [ easfbo ] ) , ( [ ecutbo ] ) are analogous to boundary conditions ( [ ebotud ] ) in the elasticity theory problem .",
    "substitution of @xmath157 from eq.([esolba ] ) into the first boundary condition ( [ easfbo ] ) yields @xmath184 .",
    "eq.([eulbou ] ) is more easily solved with respect to function @xmath157 instead of @xmath156 . inside and outside the cutting surface , @xmath185 as the consequence of ( [ efiibn ] ) .",
    "then eq.([eulbou ] ) reduces to @xmath186 this equation coincides with the equation for the wedge dislocation @xcite , the difference @xmath187 playing the role of the deficit angle of the conical singularity .",
    "it has a general solution @xmath188 depending on two integration constants @xmath189 and where @xmath190 are the roots of the quadratic equation @xmath191 which has two real roots for @xmath192 , with different signs : the positive root @xmath193 and the negative one @xmath194 .    in the internal region",
    ", we have @xmath195 and @xmath196 as the consequence of the first two conditions in ( [ easfbo ] ) , the condition @xmath196 being equivalent to @xmath197 for @xmath198 .",
    "hence , the solution of einstein s equations in the internal region is @xmath199 it depends on one arbitrary constant @xmath200 .",
    "so , the first two boundary conditions in ( [ easfbo ] ) fix two constants of integration of einstein s equations , @xmath197 and @xmath184 , which are the same in both internal and external regions and one constant of integration of elastic gauge , @xmath195 .    to reduce the number of indices , we denote constants of integration in eq.([egeuls ] ) in the external region by new letters , @xmath201 the constant of integration @xmath197",
    "was already fixed in the internal region , and therefore @xmath196 and @xmath202",
    ". the third asymptotic condition ( [ easfbo ] ) determines @xmath203 and yields solution in the external region , @xmath204 which also depends on one arbitrary constant @xmath205 .",
    "to express constants @xmath200 and @xmath205 in terms of parameters @xmath162 and @xmath20 characterizing the source , we use matching conditions . the first condition in eqs.([ecutbo ] ) relates constants @xmath200 and @xmath205 . denoting @xmath206 and @xmath207",
    ", we obtain eq.([eglsur ] ) . finally , the second matching condition in eq.([ecutbo ] ) yields @xmath208 where @xmath209 , coincides with the coefficient in front of the @xmath0-function in source term ( [ etusou ] ) .",
    "thus , we solved the problem for the tube dislocation within the geometric theory of defects .",
    "the triad field is given by ( [ etranz ] ) where functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 are given by eqs.([einsol ] ) and ( [ eousol ] ) .",
    "the induced metric ( [ eunmeg ] ) coincides exactly with the induced metric obtained within the elasticity theory ( [ eindum ] ) .",
    "it is important that we obtain the induced metric by solving einstein s equations in the elastic gauge knowing nothing about the displacement vector field . if needed , we can reconstruct the displacement vector field in the internal and external regions by solving equation @xmath210 with appropriate boundary conditions , where @xmath30 is defined in ( [ eeldef ] ) .",
    "the solution of this equation exists , because the curvature tensor is zero in both regions , @xmath211 . in terms of metric",
    ", we have to find such coordinate systems in the internal and external regions were metric becomes euclidean .",
    "this can be easily done .",
    "the essential two dimensional part of the metric in the inside and outside regions of the gluing surface are @xmath212 introducing new coordinate @xmath213 in the internal and @xmath214 in the external regions , the metric is brought to the euclidean form @xmath215 in both regions .",
    "afterwards , we immediately obtain the displacement vector field ( [ edifun ] ) using definition ( [ eeldef ] ) .",
    "so , we solved the problem for the tube dislocation within the elasticity theory and geometric theory of defects .",
    "the result is the same in both approaches , although this coincidence is not an automatic rule .",
    "for example , the induced metric for the wedge dislocation obtained in the geometric theory of defects @xcite differs essentially from that in the elasticity theory and reproduces the elasticity theory result only in the linear approximation .",
    "this happens because the elastic gauge conditions ( [ efouad ] ) coincide with equations of the nonlinear elasticity theory for the displacement vector field .",
    "there is a natural question : why should we use the sophisticated geometric theory of defects if the ordinary elasticity theory works ?",
    "the answer is the following .",
    "the elasticity theory works quite well for a single defect or in the case of several single defects .",
    "if there are many single defects than the boundary conditions become so complicated that there is no hope to solve the corresponding problem . for example",
    ", we do not know the solution for arbitrary distribution of parallel wedge dislocations within the elasticity theory whereas this problem has a simple solution in the geometric theory of defects @xcite .",
    "there is also a more important reason .",
    "suppose that we have a continuous distribution of defects , then the displacement vector field does not exist and we can not even pose the problem within the elasticity theory . at the same time , the problem for continuous distribution in the geometric theory of defects is well posed : we have expression for the free energy ( [ eacfre ] ) and gauge conditions ( [ efouad ] ) , ( [ elorog ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that we have to consider a continuous source of defects @xmath141 ( the energy - momentum tensor density ) .",
    "the surface density of the burgers vector is given by torsion components ( [ etocoa ] ) .",
    "simple calculations show that torsion for the tube dislocation has only one independent nontrivial component , @xmath216 which is singular on the cutting surface , but is nontrivial in the internal and external regions .",
    "projection of the total burgers vector on the @xmath217 axis is given by the integral and equals zero , @xmath218 similarly , its projection on any other straight line crossing the origin is identically zero",
    ". therefore the total burgers vector is zero .",
    "the main result of previous sections is the space metric ( [ eindum ] ) describing a tube dislocation .",
    "we proved that it satisfies three - dimensional einstein s equations ( [ enmode ] ) with the source ( [ etusou ] ) .",
    "the generalization to four - dimensional general relativity is straightforward .",
    "we assume that the tube dislocation does not move , i.e. , it is static .",
    "the corresponding metric is @xmath219 where the functions @xmath220 and @xmath221 are defined in ( [ edefiu ] ) and ( [ edifun ] ) . the component @xmath222 is not continuous and @xmath72 is continuous but not differentiable .",
    "it is an easy exercise to check that all components of christoffel s symbols and curvature tensor having at least one time index are identically zero for metric ( [ etufou ] ) .",
    "therefore this metric satisfies einstein s equations @xmath223 where greek letters from the beginning of the alphabet take values from 0 to 3 .",
    "the matter energy - momentum tensor density has only two nonvanishing components , @xmath224 it is a remarkable feature that all ambiguous terms in the left hand side of eq.([eeitub ] ) for the metric ( [ etufou ] ) cancel .",
    "so , metric ( [ etufou ] ) satisfies einstein s equations and its physical meaning is clear from previous sections : it describes a static tube dislocation .",
    "in previous sections , we described the tube dislocation in the framework of elasticity theory and geometric theory of defects .",
    "the results turned out to be identical . here",
    "we describe another tube dislocations which are called conical tube dislocations because they have asymptotic of conical singularity at infinity . they are described entirely within the geometric theory of defects , the solution of the problem in elasticity theory being unknown .    in this section ,",
    "integration constants are denoted by the same letters as in section [ stugeo ] though they have different values .",
    "consider three dimensional euclidean einstein s equations ( [ enmode ] ) with the source term having only one nonzero component @xmath225 in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "in contrast to previous considerations , we changed the derivative of the @xmath0-function in ( [ etusou ] ) into the @xmath0-function itself .",
    "we are looking for solutions of this problem which has translational and circular symmetry .",
    "the constant @xmath226 is interpreted as the deficit angle of conical singularity corresponding to the asymptotic at @xmath227 .",
    "this problem is equivalent to the problem of the static conical tube dislocation in general relativity with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath228 physical meaning of @xmath229 is the surface energy density of the thin cylinder of radius @xmath20 . for usual matter distribution , @xmath230 .",
    "however , we consider both cases because mathematics does not depend much on the sign of @xmath226 .",
    "we choose the metric in the diagonal form as in eq.([eunmeg ] ) .",
    "then the whole system of einstein s equations reduce to one linear ordinary differential equation @xmath231 it is easily integrated : @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the step function ( [ estepf ] ) and @xmath172 are two integration constants .",
    "so , einstein s equations define the @xmath173 component of the triad in terms of the @xmath234 component , which can be an arbitrary positive function .",
    "if @xmath149 is a continuous function then @xmath150 is also continuous due to eq.([esebpr ] ) , but its derivative has a jump ( [ efibpr ] ) .    to specify the solution uniquely",
    ", we impose the elastic gauge ( [ efouad ] ) which reduces to eq.([eulbou ] ) .",
    "we are looking for solutions of this equation inside the cutting surface , @xmath179 , and outside it , @xmath180 .",
    "in elasticity theory , the wedge dislocation corresponds to an infinite cylinder of finite radius , @xmath235 , because stresses are divergent at infinity @xcite .",
    "we suppose that @xmath236 .",
    "therefore we impose the following boundary conditions @xmath237 the last boundary condition implies the absence of external normal forces on the boundary of the cylinder .",
    "we also impose matching conditions on the cutting surface @xmath238    in the internal region , @xmath185 due to eq.([efibpr ] ) .",
    "therefore the elastic gauge reduces to eq.([ebfute ] ) with the same boundary conditions as for the tube dislocation considered earlier .",
    "hence , @xmath197 and @xmath184 and the solution in the internal region is given by eq.([einsol ] ) as before .",
    "in the external region , @xmath239 , where @xmath240 , because @xmath197 . a general solution to eq.([ebfute ] ) is @xmath241 where @xmath242 and @xmath243 are roots of the equation @xmath244    the third boundary condition in eq.([ebocot ] ) , @xmath245 relates @xmath246 to @xmath205 for a given @xmath247 .",
    "afterwards , constants @xmath200 and @xmath205 are determined through @xmath226 and @xmath20 by matching conditions ( [ emacos ] ) @xmath248 in practice , we first solve eqs.([ematoc]),([ematsc ] ) : @xmath249 the constant @xmath200 is found after substitution of these solutions into eq.([ethbou ] ) , @xmath250    so , the solution for a conical tube dislocation is @xmath251 where @xmath252 where constants @xmath253 are given by eqs.([esolec ] ) , ( [ esolfo ] ) in terms of constants @xmath226 , @xmath20 , and @xmath247 defining the problem .",
    "the components of the metric are continuous functions , but first derivative of @xmath157 has the jump @xmath226 at @xmath254 .",
    "now we give physical interpretation of the constant @xmath226 .",
    "suppose that the radius @xmath247 of the cylinder is large , @xmath255 .",
    "then near the boundary of the cylinder @xmath256 the constants become @xmath257 and metric ( [ econtu ] ) is asymptotically @xmath258 this is precisely the metric for the wedge dislocation corresponding to the conical singularity with the deficit angle @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "thus the constant @xmath226 standing in front of the @xmath0-function of the source ( [ esoutu ] ) coincides with the wedge which is removed , @xmath259 , or added , @xmath230 , to the media .    from physical standpoint , we have found the metric for a conical tube dislocation which defines elastic stresses around the defect .",
    "note that this solution does depend on the elastic properties of media in contrast to metric ( [ eindum ] ) obtained earlier .",
    "the metric can be considered as a solution to the problem even without knowing the displacement vector field distribution . however , an explicit construction of the displacement vector is very instructive and helps to imagine the defect creation ( cut and paste procedure ) .    in the internal region",
    "the two - dimensional part of metric ( [ econtu ] ) is @xmath260 in terms of new radial coordinate @xmath261 , the metric becomes euclidean , @xmath262 with the gluing surface at @xmath254 corresponding to @xmath263 .",
    "it means that the cylinder @xmath264 in the euclidean space @xmath265 is mapped into the internal region of the conical tube dislocation .",
    "the displacement vector field ( [ eeldef ] ) has only one nonzero component @xmath266 .    in the external region , the two dimensional part of the metric is @xmath267 introducing new coordinates , @xmath268 the metric is brought to the euclidean form @xmath269 the range of new coordinates is @xmath270 where @xmath271 it means that the external part of the cylinder @xmath272 of the euclidean space without the wedge @xmath273 is mapped into the external region of the conical tube dislocation . in this region ,",
    "the displacement vector field has two nonvanishing components , @xmath274    it is easily checked that circumference of the internal circle is equal to the remained part of the external circle , @xmath275 , in accordance with eq.([ematsc ] ) .",
    "this provides the continuity of the @xmath222 component of the metric on the gluing surface .",
    "the process of conical defect tube creation is shown in fig.[fcontu ] .",
    "for negative deficit angle @xmath226 , we take the euclidean space @xmath2 with cylindrical coordinates @xmath276 , cut out the thick cylinder @xmath277 and the wedge @xmath273 , and glue the sides of the cuts symmetrically as shown in the figure .",
    "afterwards , the media comes to some equilibrium state governed by the elastic gauge which is called the conical tube dislocation . for positive deficit angle",
    ", the wedge is added to the external part of the media , and the internal cylinder must be compressed before gluing because @xmath21 in this case .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] +    this problem can be probably solved within the linear elasticity theory though this solution is unknown to us .",
    "anyway , this solution reproduces only the linear approximation to the solution obtained within the geometric theory of defects because the elastic gauge ( [ efouad ] ) corresponds to nonlinear elasticity theory .",
    "this example shows that some problems are more easily treated within the geometric theory of defects .",
    "it is not easy to imagine a space - time as a product of time @xmath278 with the spacelike cylinder of finite radius @xmath247 with metric ( [ econtu ] ) because it is geodesically incomplete ( a geodesic line reaches the boundary of the cylinder at a finite value of the proper time ) . but expression for the metric ( [ econtu ] ) is valid for all values @xmath279 .",
    "therefore we can generalize the solution to the whole space - time @xmath280 where @xmath281 , @xmath279 , and @xmath282 .",
    "it is the solution of four - dimensional einstein s equations with energy - momentum tensor ( [ enmoco ] ) describing a static conical tube dislocation .",
    "this solution is written in the elastic gauge and therefore depends explicitly on the poisson ratio @xmath283 of the universe .",
    "if this defect is observed in cosmology , then the poisson ratio can be measured .",
    "anyway , the geometric theory of defects provides a way for measuring the elastic constants of our universe .",
    "the process of defect creation described in the previous section can be inverted .",
    "suppose that metric has continuous components .",
    "let us take the cylindrical rod of media of radius @xmath16 and cut out the wedge of angle @xmath226 from it as shown in fig.[fasfco ] .",
    "then we cut out a cylinder of smaller radius @xmath284 from the infinite media and insert the rod in the media after appropriate compression in such a way that circumferences of the internal and external cylinders coincide , @xmath285 this guarantees the continuity of the @xmath222 component of the metric .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] +    physically , we have a cosmic string surrounded by the cylindrical shell of matter in such a way that it becomes flat outside the shell , and we call it asymptotically flat wedge dislocation .",
    "let us describe asymptotically flat wedge dislocation mathematically .",
    "the source for the asymptotically flat wedge dislocation differs by the sign from that for a conical tube dislocation , @xmath286 later we shall show that for another choice of the sign in the formula above , einstein s equations do not have flat solutions outside the gluing surface at @xmath287 .",
    "therefore , solutions with negative deficit angle , @xmath288 , have physical meaning in general relativity .",
    "integration of einstein s equations is similar to the case of the conical tube dislocation , @xmath289 we impose the following boundary conditions at the origin and infinity @xmath290 where @xmath193 is the positive root of eq.([equaga ] ) and @xmath240 .",
    "so , the right hand side of the second equation is written entirely in terms of the deficit angle @xmath226 and poisson ratio .",
    "the first two boundary conditions correspond to a conical singularity at the origin where the metric must have the form ( [ easmet ] ) .",
    "the third boundary condition corresponds to flat asymptotic at infinity .",
    "the matching boundary conditions are continuity equations ( [ emacos ] ) as for the conical tube dislocation .    in the internal region , @xmath291 and the first two boundary conditions in eq.([ebouas ] ) determine three constants , @xmath292    in the external region , @xmath293 and we see the necessity of the minus sign in the source term ( [ easflw ] ) for asymptotic flatness .",
    "so , the external solution is @xmath294 the third boundary condition in eq.([ebouas ] ) determines @xmath203 .",

    "transformation to the euclidean form of the metric , @xmath215 , is given by different coordinate changes in the internal and external regions .",
    "inside the gluing surface ,",
    "@xmath298 so , there is a conical singularity of deficit angle @xmath226 , and @xmath299 outside the gluing surface , @xmath300 and @xmath301 for negative deficit angle , @xmath288 , @xmath302 , and @xmath284 as it should be from elementary geometric considerations .",

    "this problem has translational symmetry along @xmath39 axis and circular symmetry in the @xmath305 plane , as earlier .",
    "einstein s equations ( [ enmode ] ) for this source and metric ( [ eunmeg ] ) reduce to the ordinary differential equation @xmath306 and can be easily integrated @xmath307    one constant of integration can be fixed by the requirement that the circumference of a cylinder surrounding @xmath39 axis shrinks to zero as @xmath308 .",
