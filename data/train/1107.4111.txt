    "let @xmath8 be a number field and @xmath9 a transitive permutation group on @xmath10 letters . in order to study the distribution of fields",
    "with given degree and galois group , we introduce the following counting function : @xmath11 here @xmath12 denotes the discriminant of @xmath8 , counting conjugate fields as one . our goal is to study this function for @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in @xcite ,",
    "malle conjectured that @xmath15 for some constant @xmath16 and for explicit constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and this has been proven for all abelian groups @xmath19 . although this conjecture seems to be close to the truth on the whole , klners found a counterexample when @xmath20 by showing that the conjecture predicts the wrong value for @xmath18 in @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has been modified to explain all known counter - examples in @xcite .",
    "+ we now turn to the study of @xmath0 . by malle s conjecture , we expect that @xmath21 this question is closely related to average @xmath22-parts of class numbers of quadratic fields",
    ". in general , let @xmath23 be a prime , @xmath24 range over fundamental discriminants , and @xmath25 then the heuristics of cohen - lenstra predicts that the average of @xmath26 over all imaginary quadratic fields is @xmath27 , and the average of @xmath26 over all real quadratic fields is @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , one can show using class field theory that the cohen - lenstra heuristics imply that malle s conjecture is true for @xmath1 quintic fields .",
    "conversely , the best known upper bound for @xmath0 is proved using the `` trivial '' bound ( @xcite ) : @xmath29 this gives @xmath5 , and any improved bound would give non - trivial information on average @xmath22-parts of class groups in a similar manner .",
    "in this paper , we consider a method of point counting on varieties to give upper bounds on @xmath0 .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ mainthm ] to any quintic number field @xmath8 with galois group @xmath1 , there corresponds a triple @xmath30 with @xmath31}$ ] and @xmath32 , such that @xmath33}_{\\mathbb{q}}\\left(b^2 - 4 \\cdot { \\overline}{a } \\cdot a^2\\right ) = 5 \\cdot c^2\\ ] ] and which satisfies the following under any archimedean valuation : @xmath34 conversely , the triple @xmath35 uniquely determines @xmath8 .    in section  [ sec : num ] , we further provide numerical evidence that @xmath36 for very small @xmath37 ; in particular the exponent appears to be much lower than @xmath38 .",
    "+ before we prove theorem [ mainthm ] , we show that earlier work of wong @xcite in the case of @xmath39 can be handled in a similar fashion .",
    "namely , we give a shorter proof of the following theorem :    [ wongthm ] to any quartic number field @xmath8 with galois group @xmath7 , there corresponds a tuple @xmath40 , such that @xmath41}_{{\\mathbb{q } } } \\left(32 a_2 ^ 3 + 108 a_3 ^ 2 - 6 a_2 ( 4a_2 ^ 2 + 48 a_4 ) - 12\\sqrt{-3 } y\\right),\\ ] ] and which satisfies the following under any archimedean valuation : @xmath42 conversely , given such a tuple , there corresponds at most one @xmath7-quartic field .",
    "in particular , we have that @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a transitive permutation group .",
    "if @xmath8 is a number field of discriminant @xmath12 and degree @xmath10 for which @xmath44 , then minkowski theory implies there is an element @xmath45 of trace zero with @xmath46 where the implied constant depends only on @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath8 is a primitive extension of @xmath47 , then @xmath48 , so the characteristic polynomial of @xmath37 will determine @xmath8 .",
    "one can use this to give an upper bound on @xmath49 ( at least in the case where @xmath8 is primitive ) , since every pair @xmath50 as above gives a @xmath51-point of @xmath52^g / ( s_1)$ ] , where @xmath53 ( here @xmath54^g$ ] denotes the ring of @xmath19-invariant polynomials in @xmath54 $ ] ) .",
    "in this section , we sketch a simplified ( although essentially equivalent ) version of wong s proof @xcite that @xmath55 as motivation for our main theorem . in this section , we assume that the reader is familiar with the arguments in wong s paper .",
    "as noted in the last section , it suffices to count triples @xmath56 for which @xmath57 under any archimedean valuation and @xmath58 for some @xmath59 .",
    "( see equation  4.2 of @xcite . )",
    "the key observation of wong s paper ( although he does not state it in this way ) is that this equation can be rearranged as @xmath60}_{{\\mathbb{q } } } \\left(32 a_2 ^ 3 + 108 a_3 ^ 2 - 6 a_2 ( 4a_2 ^ 2 + 48 a_4 ) - 12\\sqrt{-3 } y\\right).\\ ] ]    one now notes that there are @xmath6 possibilities for @xmath61 , and for each of these choices @xmath62 can be written in @xmath63 ways as a norm of an element of @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "thus , it suffices to count the number of points @xmath65 for which @xmath66 are fixed .",
    "but the above equation defines an elliptic curve , on which the number of integral points can be bounded by theorem 3 in @xcite .",
    "this then gives wong s bound ( as well as the conditional bound assuming standard conjectures as wong shows ) .",
    "in this section , we give the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] . as explained in section  [ sec : varieties ] , it suffices to understand the @xmath51-points of @xmath67^{d_5 } / ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5)\\ ] ] inside a particular box .",
    "write @xmath68 for a primitive @xmath22th root of unity , and define @xmath69 in terms of the @xmath70 , we define @xmath71    the expressions @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath4 are invariant under the action of @xmath1 .",
    "note that the generators of @xmath1 act by @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; the result follows immediately .",
    "we have @xmath31}$ ] and @xmath32 .",
    "to see the first assertion , it suffices to show that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are invariant by the element of @xmath76 / { \\mathbb{q}})$ ] given by @xmath77 .",
    "but this induces the map @xmath74 , so this is clear .    to see that @xmath4 is in @xmath51 , we observe that the generator of @xmath76 / { \\mathbb{q}})$ ] given by @xmath78 acts by @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath80 is an algebraic integer , it follows that @xmath80 must be a rational integer times @xmath81 , so @xmath32 .",
    "now , we compute @xmath82 therefore , @xmath33}_{\\mathbb{q}}\\left(b^2 - 4 \\cdot { \\overline}{a } \\cdot a^2\\right ) = ( v_1 \\cdot v_2 ^ 2 - v_3 ^ 2 \\cdot v_4)^2 \\cdot ( v_2 \\cdot v_4 ^ 2 - v_1 ^ 2 \\cdot v_3)^2 = 5 \\cdot c^2,\\ ] ] which verifies the identity claimed in theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "to finish the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] , it remains to show that to each triple @xmath30 , there corresponds at most one @xmath1-quintic field . to do this",
    ", we begin with the following lemma .",
    "[ nonzero ] none of the @xmath70 are zero .",
    "suppose that some @xmath70 is zero .",
    "since @xmath83 , it follows that @xmath84 , and hence @xmath33}_{\\mathbb{q}}\\left ( b^2 \\right ) = 5 \\cdot c^2 \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad b = c = 0.\\ ] ] using @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 , so @xmath87 . similarly , using @xmath88",
    ", we have @xmath89 .",
    "thus , all pairwise products @xmath90 with @xmath91 are zero , so at most one @xmath92 is nonzero . solving for the @xmath93 , we find @xmath94 for some constant @xmath95 .",
    "( it is easy to verify that this is a solution , since @xmath96 ; it is unique up to rescaling because the transformation @xmath97 is given by a vandermonde matrix of rank @xmath98 ) .",
    "hence , the minimal polynomial of @xmath37 is @xmath99 , which is visibly not a @xmath1 extension .",
    "[ two ] for fixed @xmath30 , there are at most two possibilities for the ordered quadruple @xmath100    since @xmath101 and @xmath102 are determined , there are at most two possibilities for the ordered pair @xmath103 .",
    "similarly , there at most two possibilities for the ordered pair @xmath104 ; thus if @xmath105 , then we are done .",
    "otherwise , @xmath106 since @xmath107 , this shows that the ordered pair @xmath103 determines @xmath104 .",
    "hence there are at most two possibilities our ordered quadruple .",
    "[ ten ] for fixed @xmath30 , there are at most ten possibilities for @xmath108 .    in light of lemmas",
    "[ two ] and  [ nonzero ] , it suffices to show there at most five possibilities for @xmath108 when we have fixed nonzero values for @xmath109 but this follows from the identities @xmath110    this completes the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] , because @xmath111 , so each @xmath1-quintic field corresponds to ten ordered quadruples @xmath108 , each of which can be seen to correspond to the same triple @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the triple @xmath30 uniquely determines the @xmath1-quintic field , since otherwise we would have at least @xmath112 quadruples @xmath108 corresponding to @xmath30 , contradicting lemma  [ ten ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath8 is a @xmath1-quintic field corresponding to a triple @xmath30 with @xmath113 .",
    "then the composite of @xmath114 $ ] with the unique quadratic subfield @xmath115 is generated by adjoining to @xmath114 $ ] the square root of @xmath116    using the results of the previous section , we note that @xmath117 by inspection , the @xmath1-action on the above expression is by the sign representation , and the action of @xmath76 / { \\mathbb{q}}[\\sqrt{5}])$ ] is trivial .",
    "hence , adjoining the above quantity to @xmath114 $ ] generates the composite of @xmath114 $ ] with the quadratic subfield @xmath118 .",
    "numerical evidence indicates that the number of triples @xmath30 satisfying the conditions of theorem  [ mainthm ] is @xmath119 for a small number @xmath37 ( in particular , much less than @xmath120 ) .",
    "more precisely , we have the following table of results .",
