    "the rayleigh instability is a well - known instability of the interface between two liquids in the field of gravity when the heavier liquid is placed above the lighter one .",
    "the similar effect is difficult to observe in solids since any displacement of a piece of the solid body is impeded due to appearing elastic stresses .",
    "however , there exists an elastic stress - free possibility of changing the shape of a crystal , namely , remelting in the hydrostatic pressure gradient .",
    "a @xmath0he crystal in contact with its superfluid phase could be one of most promising objects to observe the manifestation of the rayleigh instability for the liquid - solid interface .",
    "in fact , solid @xmath0he density is larger than that of the liquid phase .",
    "the growth rate of atomically rough crystal surfaces increases drastically with the lowering of the temperature , and the change of the crystal shape can occur in very short time intervals of about 1  s. unfortunately , in most of crystal growth experiments @xcite a @xmath0he crystal appears either at the bottom of an experimental cell or drops on the same bottom later if a crystal seed nucleates first at the wall .",
    "thus , preparing the necessary configuration with the heavier crystal above its lighter liquid phase in order to have the initial condition for the development of the classical rayleigh instability comes across a difficulty .",
    "nevertheless , one experiment , in which the necessary liquid - crystal configuration against the direction of gravity is arranged , has been reported @xcite .",
    "a single hcp @xmath0he crystal is grown at the bottom of an experimental cell at the temperature of about 1.1  k lying between the first and second roughening transitions .",
    "after the grown @xmath0he crystal occupies the lower half of the optical cell , the cell is rotated mechanically through 180@xmath1 so that the @xmath0he crystal proves to be above the superfluid liquid .",
    "then the crystal phase starts to melt , descending along the cell walls . in its turn",
    ", a single finger of the superfluid phase moves in the upward direction at the center of the cell .",
    "eventually , the crystal again occupies the lower half of the cell .",
    "unfortunately , the development of the instability observed is described qualitatively and the results of visual observations are illustrated by the schematic figure alone .",
    "the main conclusion of the work is that the spatial scale associated with the development of the instability is about 1  cm .",
    "this result @xcite seems to conflict with the stability observed for the lower surface of the @xmath0he crystals grown on the needle point at the center of a cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "he crystal grown at 0.92  k between two roughening transitions as in experiment @xcite .",
    "the diameter of the visible margin is 12  mm . ]",
    "as is seen from the figure , the lower crystal facet is under conditions appropriate for the development of the gravitational rayleigh instability .",
    "the single distinction is likely to be associated with the state of the crystal @xmath0he surface . whereas in experiments @xcite one deals with the rough state of the crystal @xmath0he surface , in our experiments @xcite",
    "one observes the smooth faceted state of the surface in the form of a hcp crystal basal facet above the superfluid phase .",
    "in this paper we consider an instability of the crystal @xmath0he surface above the superfluid phase in the field of gravity .",
    "we analyze and compare two possible states of the crystal @xmath0he surface such as the rough and smooth faceted ones .",
    "we start our consideration from the high temperature region above the roughening transition when the crystal surface is in the atomically rough state .",
    "since in this case the surface tension @xmath2 has no singularity at the close - packed facets and weakly depends on the crystallographic direction , the tensor of surface stiffness @xmath3 is close to @xmath4 . thus , to simplify the analysis",
    ", we neglect any distinction between surface tension and surface stiffness in the formulas for the laplace pressure .",
    "crystallization waves , representing small oscillations of the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface , are predicted by andreev and parshin @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of crystallization waves in the field of gravity can be found from the equation @xcite @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the wave vector , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the densities of the solid and liquid phases , @xmath10 is the interface growth coefficient , and @xmath11 is the acceleration of gravity .",
    "the positive magnitude @xmath12 corresponds to the usual situation when the @xmath0he crystal lies under the liquid phase . in this case",
    "the frequencies of small interface oscillations have the negative imaginary parts for all wave vectors and the crystal surface is always stable .    provided the solid phase occupies the half - space above the liquid , the dispersion equation remains the same but parameter @xmath11 becomes negative .",
    "this means that the last term in  ( [ f1 ] ) , which dominates for sufficiently small @xmath6 , can result in the positive imaginary part for the roots of the dispersion equation .",
    "the critical magnitude of the wave vector @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath151  mm is the capillary length .",
    "the instability will develop faster for small wave vectors .",
    "for the harmonic @xmath16 , the estimate for the time of developing the instability is given by @xmath17 for @xmath181.1  k , the inverse growth coefficient @xmath19 2  m / s and @xmath20 2  s. this is in a qualitative agreement with the observations of work  @xcite .",
    "thus , the instability similar to the rayleigh one develops at the lower surface of a @xmath0he crystal in the atomically rough state .",
    "an interesting situation appears with the nucleation and growth of a crystal at the needle point at the temperatures above the roughening transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "he at 1.28  k. the diameter of the visible margin is 12  mm . ]    in the hydrostatic pressure gradient the crystal grows in the shape of a ball which melts in the upper part and crystallizes in its lower part at the same time . in outward appearance",
    "this looks like the motion of a crystal downward . in work",
    "@xcite , in which the similar situation is studied , it is shown that the crystal with the isotropic growth coefficient conserves its spherical shape , and the descending motion velocity of the sphere @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a time - dependent radius of the sphere .",
    "then , as follows from ( [ f4 ] ) , the center of the crystal shifts downward at a constant velocity in the hydrostatic pressure gradient provided the crystal volume remains unchanged .",
    "let us consider stability of the spherical shape of a crystal against small shape perturbations in the field of gravity .",
    "for analysis , we choose the frame which origin is put at the center of a crystal . in this frame the center of a crystal is fixed and the liquid phase circulates around the crystal , outflowing from the upper part of the sphere and flowing into the sphere in its lower part .",
    "we introduce @xmath24 as a small perturbation of the radius @xmath23 .",
    "the liquid phase is assumed to be incompressible and the solid one is motionless . in experiment",
    "@xcite the velocities of the liquid flow are small and do not exceed 0.1  mm / s .",
    "for the hydrodynamic pressure @xmath25 , we have an estimate 10@xmath26   dyne/@xmath27 .",
    "this magnitude is much smaller than the typical hydrostatic pressure drop @xmath28 . in what follows",
    ", we neglect quadratic terms in velocity of the liquid phase .    next , in accordance with the experimental conditions , we take into account",
    "that the experimental cell is closed and no matter comes from outside . in other words , the total mass of the liquid and solid phases remains unchanged . in the frame comoving with the crystal the center of the crystal is fixed . as a result",
    ", we can omit the spherical harmonic with @xmath29 from consideration since this harmonic is associated with the change of the volume .",
    "the next harmonic @xmath30 is responsible for the displacement of the sphere as a whole and corresponds to the circulation of the liquid around of the sphere .",
    "we also omit this harmonic from our consideration .",
    "the determination of the oscillation spectrum is not difficult but cumbersome .",
    "we give a scheme of solution and then the final result .",
    "let axis @xmath31 run in the vertical direction , and we seek for the general solution , expanding perturbation @xmath32 in spherical harmonics .",
    "since the liquid is assumed to be incompressible , it is convenient to describe its motion in terms of velocity potential @xmath33 according to @xmath34 .",
    "the mass flow across the interface is proportional to the chemical potential difference @xmath35 @xmath36 the continuity of the mass flow across the interface allows us to relate the velocity of the liquid at the interface with the interface growth rate @xmath37 . after some calculations and involving the axial symmetry with respect to axis @xmath31 , we arrive eventually at the dispersion relation @xmath38a_l \\\\ -\\frac{2r^2}{\\lambda^2}\\biggl[\\frac{l^2}{4l^2 - 1}\\ , a_{l-1}+\\frac{(l+1)(l+2)}{(2l+1)(2l+3)}\\ , a_{l+1}\\biggr]=0 , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the perturbation amplitude corresponding to @xmath41-th spherical harmonic from a sum @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we have a determinant of the infinite order for determining the proper values . in the lack of gravity",
    "@xmath43 the off - diagonal terms vanish .",
    "the roots of the master equation give the oscillation spectrum of a spherical solid with damping .",
    "all the frequencies have a negative imaginary part , resulting in the conclusion that in this case the spherically shaped solid is stable against small perturbations of its equilibrium shape .    in the presence of gravity",
    "we must involve the off - diagonal terms in ( [ f5 ] ) .",
    "note that the diagonal terms increase proportional to @xmath44 as @xmath45 , while the off - diagonal terms remain finite and have the order of @xmath46 .",
    "this means that , as the degree of harmonic @xmath41 increases , the relative effect of the pressure gradient reduces , agreeing with the stability of the flat interface at large wave vectors . as in the case of the flat interface",
    ", the instability develops in the first turn for the minimum degree of harmonics @xmath47 .",
    "the spherical shape of helium crystals in the hcp phase is observed above the first roughening transition temperature at @xmath481.25  k ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the hcp phase is limited by the hcp - bcc transition at @xmath491.44  k. within this temperature range the kinetic growth coefficient is small and varies insignificantly with the temperature from @xmath1911  m / s at the bcc transition to @xmath503  m / s near the roughening transition . inserting these values into eqs .",
    "( [ f5 ] , [ f6 ] ) and solving numerically the master equation for proper frequencies , we determine the critical radius @xmath510.61  cm",
    ". the radius of crystals studied in @xcite does not exceed this magnitude .",
    "this may serve as an explanation that all the crystals grown in that experiment display stability of their spherical shape .",
    "the proper vectors in ( [ f5 ] ) are determined with accuracy to their sign . for @xmath52 ,",
    "this gives two possible cases for developing the instability shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .        in the first case at the bottom",
    "there appears a hogging in the upward direction . in the second case",
    "we see a formation of constriction .",
    "note that the result refers only to the initial stage of developing instability .",
    "another factor which stabilizes the flat surface is a finiteness of the crystal size . in this case",
    "the spectrum of crystallization waves becomes discrete .",
    "the instability will appear at the minimum wave vector .",
    "to estimate , we replace the hexagonal crystal shape with the equivalent cylindrical one of radius @xmath53",
    ". then we can show that dispersion equation ( [ f1 ] ) holds its form but the perturbation amplitude @xmath32 of the flat crystal surface is given by @xmath54 where @xmath33 is the azimuth angle , @xmath55 is the bessel function , and @xmath56 is the distance from the center of a cylinder . for the circular symmetry at the fixed volume of a crystal ,",
    "the minimum wave vector @xmath13 is determined from the relation @xmath57 from expressions ( [ f1][f3 ] ) and ( [ f8 ] ) one can obtain that the instability should appear for a crystal with the diameter larger than 6  mm .",
    "below the roughening transition temperature a singularity appears as a nonanalytic angular dependence in the behavior of the surface tension versus angle @xmath58 between the direction of crystallographic axis and the normal to the crystal surface @xcite @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the quantity proportional to the energy of a crystal facet step and is positive below the roughening transition temperature .",
    "this entails that the surface tension and surface stiffness represent the drastically different quantities .",
    "the surface stiffness becomes infinite for zero angle @xmath61 .",
    "the singularity prevents from varying the shape of the crystal facet and qualitatively changes the conditions for stability .",
    "let us consider the distinctions in appearing the rayleigh instability in comparison with the case of the rough crystal surface .",
    "below the roughening transition the energy variation of the surface for sufficiently small perturbation amplitude @xmath62 from the horizontal flat facet is equal to @xmath63 the smallness of @xmath32 and @xmath64 for the correct and consistent use of the expansion of energy in @xmath32 is provided by inequality @xmath65 .",
    "let us start from the one - dimensional case , namely , flat bar of length @xmath66 . the energy per unit length @xmath67 reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the width of the crystal bar in the transverse direction .",
    "the boundary conditions at the ends of the bar @xmath70 correspond to the case when the crystal surface is immobile at these points .",

    "the extremum satisfies the equation @xmath75 two types of functions can be solutions of the equation @xmath76 i.e. , either a constant or a sine function .",
    "the height of a potential barrier for destructing the flat crystal facet as well as the type of a critical fluctuation depend on the magnitude @xmath77 .",
    "for sufficiently small length of the facet @xmath78 , there exists a single trivial solution @xmath79 , and the flat crystal facet remains stable . for @xmath80",
    ", there appears a nontrivial solution which consists of two half - sinusoids and flat segment @xmath81 here the function @xmath82 is continuous together with its derivative at points @xmath83 and vanishes at @xmath84 .",

    "the overcoming of such barrier is practically impossible during the time of experiment .",
    "thus , the appearance of the singular angle dependence in the function @xmath96 results in a drastic change for stability conditions of the crystal surface . with very small cooling below the roughening transition temperature the potential barrier becomes sufficiently large and the probability of its overcoming due to thermal or quantum fluctuations is vanishingly small .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the experimental evidence for stability of the crystal shape below the roughening transition .",

    "the crystal has a clear lateral facet which remained stable in the course of experiment during , at least , 10  min .",
    "the gravitational instability at the atomically rough @xmath0he surface , which develops under the lack of any potential barrier , is similar to the classical rayleigh instability when the heavier liquid lies above the lighter liquid .",
    "the distinction is that the time necessary for the development of instability is determined by the kinetic growth coefficient of a crystal surface .    as for the smooth faceted crystal surface ,",
    "having a singularity in the surface stiffness , the development of the surface instability becomes possible due to thermal or quantum fluctuations if the size of the facet surface exceeds the critical one .",
