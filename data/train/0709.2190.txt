    "because white dwarfs can not replenish the energy they radiate away  any residual nuclear burning is negligible and gravitational contraction is severely impeded by electron degeneracy  their luminosity decreases monotonically with time .",
    "a thorough knowledge of the rate at which wds cool can provide a valuable `` cosmic clock '' to determine the ages of many galactic populations , including the disk @xcite , and open and globular clusters @xcite . with more accurate models of the cooling physics of white dwarfs , heavily constrained by empirical evidence",
    ", it may be possible to determine absolute ages with greater precision than using main - sequence evolution theory .",
    "in addition to applications in astronomy , white dwarfs allow us to probe the physics of degenerate matter at temperatures and densities no terrestrial laboratory can duplicate .",
    "attempts at an empirical luminosity function ( lf ) for white dwarfs date as far back as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the low - luminosity shortfall , discovered by @xcite , and attributed by @xcite to the finite age of the galactic disk , was confirmed and explored more fully when a greater volume of reliable data on low - luminosity wds became available @xcite .",
    "more recently , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric data have been used to provide a much more detailed luminosity function with more than an order of magnitude more white dwarfs than previously attempted @xcite , as well a new lf of a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed wds @xcite .",
    "however , to date no one has published a well - populated luminosity function that does not include a wide range of masses and spectral types .",
    "thus , much of the important physics of white dwarf cooling remains buried in the data .    until recently , empirical wd luminosity functions , especially those derived from stars with spectra ,",
    "have been hampered by a limited volume of reliable data .",
    "this has forced a trade - off between the number of stars included in a sample , and their homogeneity ; either a broad range of temperatures , masses , and spectral types must be used , or else the sample population of stars would be so small as to render reliable conclusions difficult .",
    "recently , the situation has changed dramatically .",
    "data from sdss dr4 have yielded nearly 10,000 white dwarf spectra .",
    "all of these spectra have been fitted with model atmospheres to determine their effective temperatures and surface gravities @xcite .    in a companion paper to be published shortly , we intend to focus on how the wd cooling rate changes with wd mass .",
    "theoretical work has been done in this area @xcite , but to date , attempts at creating an empirical lf to explore the effects of mass have relied on limited sample sizes @xcite . in order to further isolate the effect of mass , we have chosen to study only the da white dwarfs ",
    "white dwarfs which show only lines of hydrogen in their spectra  which comprise @xmath686% of all white dwarfs .",
    "in addition to helping unlock the physics of white dwarfs , creating luminosity functions for several mass bins can also help to disentangle the effects of changes in cooling rates from changes in star formation rates . a burst or dip in star formation at a given instant in galactic history",
    "should be recorded in all of the luminosity functions , regardless of mass , and could be confirmed by its position across the various mass bins .",
    "for example , a short burst of increased star formation would be seen as a bump in each luminosity function , occurring at cooler temperatures in the higher mass lf ( these stars , with shorter ms lifetimes , have had longer to cool ) . on the other hand ,",
    "features intrinsic to the cooling physics of the white dwarfs themselves should be seen in places that correspond with the underlying physics , which may be earlier , later , or nearly concurrent across mass bins .",
    "these effects include neutrino cooling , crystallization , the onset of convective coupling @xcite , and debye cooling @xcite .",
    "the current paper lays the groundwork for this analysis . in section [ data ] , we introduce the data , examining the methods used to classify spectra and derive quantities of interest ( dominant atmospheric element , @xmath7 , and log @xmath1 ) . we also address the observed upturn in log @xmath1 for das below @xmath8 12,000k .",
    "we present several lines of reasoning that the upturn is an artifact of the line fitting procedure , and propose an empirical method for correcting the problem .",
    "section [ construction ] outlines the methods used to construct the luminosity and mass function and determine error bars .    in section [ completeness ]",
    ", we present an analysis of the completeness of our data sample .",
    "we use a well - defined sample of proper - motion selected , photometrically determined white dwarfs in sdss @xcite to determine our completeness and derive a correction as a function of @xmath0 color and @xmath1 magnitude . finally , in section [ discussion ]",
    ", we present our best luminosity and mass functions for the entire da spectroscopic sample and discuss the impact of both our empirical log @xmath1 correction and our completeness correction .",
    "our white dwarf data comes mainly from @xcite , a catalog of spectroscopically identified white dwarfs from the fourth data release ( dr4 ) of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "the sdss is a survey of @xmath68,000 square degrees of sky at high galactic latitudes .",
    "it is , first and foremost , a redshift survey of galaxies and quasars .",
    "large `` stripes '' of sky are imaged in 5 bands ( u , g , r , i , z ) and objects are selected , on the basis of color and morphology , to be followed up with spectroscopy , accomplished by means of twin fiber - fed spectrographs , each with separate red and blue channels with a combined wavelength coverage of about 3800 to 9200 and a resolution of 1800 .",
    "objects are assigned fibers based on their priority in accomplishing sdss science objectives , with high redshift galaxies , `` bright red galaxies '' and quasars receiving the highest priority .",
    "stars are assigned fibers for spectrophotometric calibration , and other classes of objects are only assigned fibers that are left over on each plate .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the target selection and tiling algorithms can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    though white dwarfs are given their own ( low priority ) category in the spectroscopic selection algorithms , very few white dwarfs are targeted in this way .",
    "rather , most of the white dwarfs in sdss obtain spectra only through the `` back door , '' most often when the imaging pipeline mistakes them for quasars .",
    "@xcite list the various algorithms that target objects ultimately determined to be white dwarfs in dr1 ( their table 1 ) .",
    "white dwarfs are most commonly targeted by the qso and serendipity_blue algorithms , with significant contributions also from hot_standard ( standard stars targeted for spectrophotometric calibration ) and serendipity_distant . of the significant contributors",
    ", the star_white_dwarf category contributes the least to the population of wd spectra .",
    "the sdss data release 4 contains nearly 850,000 spectra .",
    "several groups have already attempted to sort through them to find white dwarfs : @xcite for the early data release , @xcite for data release 1 ( dr1 ) , and most recently , @xcite for the dr4 , from which the majority of our data sample derives , though a handful of stars from dr1 omitted by eisenstein have been re - included from @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite have refit the da and db stars from @xcite with an expanded grid of models . a complete analysis of the methods by which candidate objects are chosen , spectra fitted , and quantities of interest are calculated can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we put forth a brief outline here , with special attention paid to those aspects important to our own analysis .",
    "objects in the sdss spectroscopic database are put through several cuts in color designed to separate the wds from the main stellar locus .",
    "figure 1 in @xcite shows the location of these cuts .",
    "the chief failing of their particular choices of cuts , as noted by the authors , is that wds with temperatures below @xmath68,000k begin to overlap in color - color space with the far more numerous a and f stars , and they have not attempted to dig these stars out . the sdss spectroscopic pipeline calculates a redshift for each object by looking for prominent lines in the spectrum .",
    "objects with redshifts higher than z=0.003 are eliminated , unless the object has a proper motion from usno - a greater than 0.3  per year . because the spectroscopic pipeline is fully automated ,",
    "occasionally dc white dwarfs show weak noise features that can be misinterpreted as low - confidence redshifts .",
    "other types of wd , particularly magnetic wds , can fool the pipeline as well . in the present paper",
    "we are concerned chiefly with da white dwarfs , so this incompleteness is of importance only insofar as we use the entire set of white dwarf spectral types to derive our completeness correction , as outlined in section [ completeness ] .",
    "we explore the implications of this more fully in that section .",
    "@xcite then use a @xmath9 minimization technique to fit the spectra and photometry of the candidate objects with separate model atmospheres of pure hydrogen and pure helium @xcite to determine the dominant element , effective temperature , surface gravity , and associated errors .",
    "as their figure 2 demonstrates , they recover a remarkably complete and uncontaminated sample of the candidate stars .",
    "they believe that they have recovered nearly all of the da white dwarfs hotter than 10,000k with sdss spectra .",
    "these stars form the core of our data sample .",
    "their final table lists data on 10,088 white dwarfs . of these",
    ", 7,755 are classified as single , non - magnetic das . @xcite",
    "re - fit the spectra for these stars using the same autofit method and koester model atmospheres , but with a denser grid which also included models up to log @xmath1 of 10.0 .",
    "where they differ from eisenstein s , we use these newer fits in our analysis . of these 7,755 entries ,",
    "@xmath6600 are actually duplicate spectra of the same star . for our analysis",
    "we take an average of the values derived from each individual spectra weighted by the quoted errors .",
    "our final sample contains 7,128 single , non - magnetic da white dwarfs .    as noted by @xcite and others , the surface gravities determined from sloan spectra show a suspicious upturn below temperatures of about 12,000k which increases at cooler temperatures , as shown in our figure [ upturn ] .",
    "a number of separate pieces of evidence argue that this upturn in log @xmath1and thus mass  is an artifact of the models and not a real effect .",
    "not least among these is that no one has yet provided any satisfactory mechanism by which wds could gain enough mass or shrink enough in radius as they cool to account for the magnitude of the effect .",
    "we do expect a slight increase in mass at cooler temperatures because in a galaxy of finite age , the cooler white dwarfs must come from higher mass progenitors .",
    "this is the reason for the upward slope of the blue dashed line in figure [ upturn ] .",
    "however , this effect is clearly small compared to the upturn observed in the actual data .",
    "furthermore , @xcite , and @xcite demonstrated that the masses derived solely from the colors do not show an increase in mass for cooler stars , which indicates that the problem is not physical , but a result of either the line fitting procedure or the line profiles themselves .",
    "figure [ colors ] further illustrates the above point .",
    "the upper panel shows the colors derived from the synthetic spectra at the values of @xmath7 and log @xmath1 quoted by @xcite ( i.e. , the values in figure [ upturn ] ) , overlaid on the actual sdss photometry for the same objects .",
    "contrast this with the lower panel , which instead shows the colors derived from the synthetic spectra when the excess log @xmath1 has been removed ( in a manner described below ; the resulting values are shown in figure [ noupturn ] ) .",
    "the colors in the latter figure agree much better with the measured color of the object .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found a similar increase in mean mass for the sdss db white dwarfs below @xmath8 16,000k .",
    "they conclude that since a ) the problem only shows up in the line profiles and not the continuum , and b ) the onset of the effect in both hydrogen ( da ) and helium ( db ) atmosphere wds occurs at just the effective temperature where the neutral species of the atmospheric element begins to dominate , then the problem lies in the treatment of line broadening by neutral particles .",
    "this is supported further by the fact that as the species continues to become more neutral ( i.e. , as the temperature drops ) , the problem grows worse .",
    "however , more recent model calculations indicate that neutral broadening is not important in the da white dwarfs at temperatures down to at least than 8,500k .",
    "other possible mechanisms to explain the observed upturn in log @xmath1 include a flawed or incomplete treatment of convection , leading to errors in the temperature structure of the outer layers of the wd models , or the convective mixing of helium from a lower layer in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the latter would require a hydrogen layer much thinner than any seismologically determined in a da so far @xcite .",
    "until the problem with the model atmospheres is resolved , the best we can do is to empirically remove the log @xmath1 upturn . for a given @xmath7",
    ", we subtract the excess in the measured mean value ( as fit by the red solid lines in figure [ upturn ] ) over the theoretically expected mean ( blue dashed line ) .",
    "figure [ noupturn ] shows the resulting values used . in fitting out the upturn this way ,",
    "we make two implicit assumptions .",
    "first , that the excess log @xmath1 is a function only of @xmath7 ; if the problem is indeed due to the treatment of neutral particles , we would expect only a small dependence on log @xmath1 .",
    "second , we assume that the problem affects only the log @xmath1 determination and not @xmath7 .",
    "this latter assumption is unlikely to be true , as the two parameters are correlated . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we explore more fully the impact of this fitting procedure on the luminosity and mass functions .",
    "since we are dealing with a magnitude - limited sample , the most luminous stars in our sample can be seen to much further distances than the intrinsically fainter stars .",
    "we thus expect more of them , proportionally , than we would in a purely volume - limited sample , and must make a correction for the different observing volumes . as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the @xmath10 method of @xcite ( described more fully in , e.g.",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides an unbiased and reliable characterization of the wdlf .    in the @xmath10 method ,",
    "each star s contribution to the total space density is weighted in inverse proportion to the total volume over which it would still be included in the magnitude limited sample . since the stars are not spherically distributed , but lie preferentially in the plane of the galaxy , an additional correction for the scale height of the galactic disk must be included . for the purposes of comparison with previous work",
    ", we adopt a scale height of 250pc .",
    "to determine the absolute magnitude of each wd , we use the effective temperatures and log @xmath1 values provided by @xcite  as corrected in section [ data]and fit each wd with an evolutionary model to determine the mass and radius . for @xmath11 log @xmath12",
    ", we use the mixed c / o models of @xcite and @xcite , as calculated by @xcite . for @xmath13 log @xmath14",
    ", we use the models of @xcite with o / ne cores , including additional sequences for masses larger than 1.3 @xmath15 calculated specifically for @xcite .",
    "once we know the radius , we can calculate the absolute magnitude in each sloan band by convolving the synthetic wd atmospheres of koester @xcite with the sloan filter curves .",
    "we apply bolometric corrections from @xcite to determine the bolometric magnitude . for the handful of stars ( @xmath680 - 100 ) with log @xmath1 values outside the range covered by bergeron s tables",
    ", we use a simple linear extrapolation .",
    "we then determine photometric distances to each star from the observed sdss @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "sdss , being concerned mostly with extragalactic objects , reports the total interstellar absorption along each line of sight from the reddening maps of @xcite . since the objects in our sample lie within the galaxy , and most of them within a few hundred parsecs ,",
    "they are affected by only a fraction of this reddening .",
    "following @xcite , we therefore assume : 1 ) that objects within 100pc are not affected by reddening , 2 ) objects with galactic height @xmath16 @xmath17 250pc are reddened by the full amount , and 3 ) that the reddening varies linearly between these two values . the distances and reddening",
    "are then fit iteratively from the observed and calculated absolute @xmath1 magnitude . in practice , the reddening correction makes very little difference to the final lf ( typical @xmath18 values range from 0.01 to 0.05 ) .",
    "we calculate error bars on the luminosity function using a monte - carlo simulation , drawing random deviates in @xmath7 , log @xmath1 , and each band of photometry from gaussian distributions centered around the measured value .",
    "the standard deviations in @xmath7 and log @xmath1 we use for this scattering are 1.2 times the formal errors quoted in @xcite ( their own analysis , based on repeated autofit measurements on duplicate spectra of the same stars , suggests that the formal errors derived by their method are @xmath620% too small ) .",
    "the photometry errors come directly from the sdss database . after scattering the parameters in this way",
    ", we recalculate the lf .",
    "we then add in quadrature the standard deviation of each lf bin after 200 iterations and the counting error for each bin ( the errors for each individual star  taken to be of the order of the star s",
    "@xmath10 statistical weight  summed in quadrature ) .    at a s /",
    "n of 16the mean for the stars in our sample brighter than @xmath19formal errors in @xmath7 and log @xmath1 are of order 1.5% .",
    "when propagated through our code , the mean errors in @xmath20 and mass are 0.35 dex and 9% ( 0.05 @xmath15 ) respectively .",
    "for the stars brighter than @xmath21 used to compile our mass functions the average s / n is 19.5 , leading to errors in @xmath20 and mass of 0.35 dex and 7% ( 0.04 @xmath15 ) .",
    "the chief difficulty we have encountered in deriving our luminosity functions is unraveling the complicated way in which sdss objects are assigned spectral fibers .",
    "sdss is foremost a survey of extragalactic objects and rarely targets white dwarfs for follow up spectroscopy explicitly .",
    "most of the objects in our sample are targeted by some other algorithm . in particular , there is considerable overlap in color between white dwarfs and many qsos .    a completeness correction could , in theory , be built from `` first principles . '' we know , for each object in the sdss spectroscopic database , by which algorithm(s ) it was targeted ( or rejected ) for spectroscopy , and by which algorithm it was ultimately assigned a fiber . and for each algorithm , we know which objects were targeted , which were ultimately assigned a fiber , and which , of the targeted objects , turned out to be wds . however , the selection process is a multi - variate function of 5 apparent magnitudes , and colors in spaces of as many as 4 dimensions ( which vary based on the algorithm ) , as well as the complex tiling algorithm .",
    "we believe such an undertaking to be unnecessary .",
    "instead we have chosen to compare our sample with the stars used to derive the wdlf of @xcite . given certain assumptions about completeness and contamination in both data sets , we derive a completeness correction as a function of a single color index ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "the @xcite sample comes from photometric data in the sdss data release 3 .",
    "they selected objects by using the reduced proper motion diagram to separate wds from more luminous subdwarfs of the same color .",
    "briefly , they used color and proper motion ( from usno - b * ? ? ? * ) to determine wd candidates from sdss imaging data .",
    "they then fit candidates with wd model atmosphere colors to determine temperatures and absolute magnitudes , from which they derived photometric distances and  together with proper motion  tangential velocities . in order to minimize contamination",
    ", they adopted a tangential velocity cutoff of 30 km / s and rejected all stars below this limit .",
    "the remaining 6,000 objects are , with a high and well - defined degree of certainty ( @xmath23 ) , likely to be white dwarfs .",
    "if the database of sdss spectra were complete , all of these objects would ( eventually ) have spectra , and all but the 1 - 2% of contaminating objects would be confirmed to be wds .",
    "furthermore , all of the wds that did _ not _ make it into the harris et al . sample  because they were either missing from the @xcite proper motion catalog , or had a tangential velocity below 30 km / s  would also all have spectra .",
    "in such a perfect world , of course , no completeness correction would be necessary .",
    "however , since sdss does not obtain a spectrum of every object in its photometric database , a significant percentage of the objects in harris et al . will not have spectra , or else will be dropped at some later point by eisenstein et al . and thus not make it into our spectroscopic sample .",
    "our goal , then , is to look at all of the wds in the harris et al .",
    "sample that potentially _ could _ have made it into our sample , and determine which ones in fact did .",
    "if we assume that the wds _ not _ in harris et al . follow the same distribution ( an assumption we discuss more fully below ) , then we can take this as a measure of the overall detection probability and invert it to get a completeness correction .    the imaging area of the dr3 , from which harris et al .",
    "derive their sample , is not the same as the spectroscopic area in the dr4 .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of this comparison , we removed all stars not found in the area of sky common to the two data sets from their respective samples .",
    "this left 5,340 objects classified as white dwarfs by harris et al .",
    "that could potentially have been recovered by eisenstein et al .",
    "of these , 2,572 were assigned spectral fibers in dr4 , and 2,346 were ultimately confirmed by eisenstein et al . to be white dwarfs .    since we wish to restrict our analysis to single ( i.e. , non - binary ) da white dwarfs",
    ", we removed all stars classified as da+m stars in either catalog . unfortunately , given that the harris catalog contains no further information as to the type of wd , we were unable to remove the non da stars and simply compare what remains with the eisenstein sample .",
    "instead , we compute the completeness for all of the wds , under the assumption  explored more fully below  that das , as the largest component of the wd population , dominate the selection function",
    ".    figure [ qsofig ] shows a comparison of the two samples .",
    "the open symbols are the complete harris et al . sample ( excluding those , as mentioned above , with @xmath24 km / s , those not in the region of sky covered by spectroscopy , and the da+m stars ) .",
    "the gray squares lie outside the cuts in color - color space imposed by eisenstein et al .",
    "they may have spectra in sdss , but they were not fit by eisenstein et al . , and therefore will not have made it into our sample .",
    "the filled green circles are the stars that _ are _ in eisenstein et al . in other words , if the sdss spectral coverage of wds were complete , and eisenstein et al .",
    "recovered every wd spectra in sdss , then all of the open circles would be filled .",
    "the inside of the blue box is the exclusion region for sdss s qso targeting algorithm @xcite , specifically implemented to eliminate wds from their sample .",
    "note that our sample is more complete for the stars outside this region .",
    "figure [ completenessfig ] shows the discovery probability as a function of @xmath0 color and @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "darker areas mean a higher probability of discovery , with black indicating that all the wds in the harris et al .",
    "sample in that area of color - magnitude space made it into our sample .",
    "we have performed a box smoothing to eliminate small scale fluctuations .",
    "there is a drop off in discovery probability for stars bluer than @xmath25 at all apparent magnitudes .",
    "this corresponds to the red edge of the exclusion region of the qso targeting algorithm , as noted above .",
    "the qso algorithm is also itself a function of apparent magnitude , which accounts for the general decrease at fainter magnitudes in the red half of the diagram , and the much steeper drop off between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the bluer stars ( @xmath28 ) , most of which are targeted by the hot_standard or serendipity_blue algorithms , show the opposite : a slight increase at fainter magnitudes .    to give a better sense of the order of magnitude of our completeness , figure [ completenesshist ] shows a histogram of the values in figure [ completenessfig ] . for most of the cells that end up in the bins for 0 , 1 , and 0.5 , the harris et al .",
    "sample contains only one or two stars .",
    "the mean completeness for the whole sample is @xmath29 .    to derive our final completeness correction",
    ", we must further consider the incompleteness and contamination in the harris et al .",
    "sample itself . assuming that the sdss photometric database is essentially complete down to @xmath30 , then the incompleteness in harris et al",
    ". comes mainly from two sources : 1 ) the incompleteness in the @xcite proper motion catalog , and 2 ) the tangential velocity limit of 30 km / s imposed , which results in some low tangential velocity wds being dropped from the sample . however , with one negligible exception , none of the criteria used to target objects for spectroscopy in sdss , nor those used by eisenstein et al . to select white dwarf candidates",
    ", depends explicitly on proper motion or tangential velocity .",
    "thus we assume that the low - velocity stars",
    " dropped from the harris et al . sample ",
    "will be recovered by eisenstein with the same probability as the high - velocity stars ",
    "the stars in figure [ qsofig ] .",
    "contamination poses a bit more challenging problem . at first glance",
    ", it would seem that the reverse of the above process could be applied , whereby those objects in harris et al . which did get spectral fibers  but were ultimately rejected as wds by eisenstein et al.could be removed from the sample , and those that did _ not _ get spectra could be assumed to follow the same distribution .",
    "this latter assumption , however , is unlikely to be true .",
    "sdss gives very low priority to targeting white dwarfs specifically , and we would thus expect a larger fraction of the objects that get spectral fibers to turn out to be contaminating objects ( in particular qsos , of which we found 13 in the harris et al .",
    "sample ) than if the fibers were assigned purely randomly .",
    "furthermore , many of the 225 objects which have spectra in dr4 but are not included in the eisenstein catalog may actually be white dwarfs which eisenstein s algorithms dropped for some other reason , e.g. they lie outside the color and magnitude ranges used for initial candidate selection , or there is a problem ( low s / n , bad pixels ) with the spectrum .",
    "approximately 100 appear to be dc white dwarfs to which the sdss spectroscopic pipeline assigned erroneous redhifts on the basis of weak noise features .",
    "ultimately , we have chosen to adopt the contamination fraction of harris et al .",
    "( 2% ) for the whole sample , and have reduced our final completeness correction accordingly .",
    "this choice has a negligible effect on the small scale structure of the wdlf in which we are interested .",
    "finally , we note that the harris et al .",
    "sample has an apparent magnitude limit of @xmath31 , whereas the spectroscopic sample contains objects down to @xmath32 .",
    "given that the sdss targeting algorithms are themselves functions of apparent magnitude , our completeness correction is as well .",
    "an extrapolation of our discovery probability is problematic in this area , though , because this is just the apparent magnitude where the qso targeting algorithm drops off rapidly .",
    "we have decided to impose a magnitude cutoff of @xmath30 in our sample .",
    "this reduces our sample by nearly a half , with a corresponding increase in counting error .",
    "however , because sdss spectra have a small range of exposure times ( 45 - 60min ) , fainter apparent magnitude usually translates directly into lower s / n and larger errors in derived parameters .",
    "figure [ mlimcomp ] shows the luminosity functions we derive for different choices of limiting magnitude .",
    "we take the generally good agreement between the curves to indicate that our completeness correction is doing its job correctly in the @xmath1 magnitude direction .",
    "figure [ mlimmasscomp ] similarly shows the mass functions we derive for different choices of limiting magnitude . in the case of the mass function , the s /",
    "n of the spectra becomes a much bigger factor . as a consequence of the essentially constant exposure times of sdss spectra , the parameters ( @xmath7 and log @xmath1 ) determined from the spectra of fainter objects have larger errors , which causes a larger error in mass .",
    "thus , the mf is broadened when stars with @xmath33 are included .",
    "for this reason , @xcite limited their mass functions to stars with @xmath34 , and we follow their lead for the remaining mfs in the current paper .",
    "figure [ wdmfcomp ] shows the wd mass function we derive for all stars with @xmath7 @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the red dashed line is the mf corrected only by @xmath10 i.e .",
    ", before we apply our completeness correction .",
    "it generally shows good agreement with the mf derived in @xcite ( blue points ) , not surprising considering we use nearly the same data set and very similar wd models .",
    "the small differences are due to our use of slightly different sets of data and models , as well as differing treatment of duplicate spectra , and can largely be considered statistical fluctuations .",
    "we refer the interested reader to their paper for a more in depth analysis of the wdmf .",
    "the solid black line in the upper panel shows our mf after correcting for the completeness of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "this curve represents the true local space density of wds per cubic parsec per @xmath15 interval .",
    "the bottom panel shows the total weight of each bin above the uncorrected mf  essentially the final completeness correction for each bin .",
    "there is little small scale variation from bin to bin , and our completeness correction mainly has the effect of raising the normalization of the whole mf by a factor of @xmath37 . in other words ,",
    "the shape of the mf is not strongly affected by the completeness correction .",
    "figure [ allwdmf ] is the wdmf for all stars down to 8,000k .",
    "the dashed red line is for the data as reported by @xcite , the dotted blue line is after our correction for the upturn in log @xmath1 .",
    "the solid black line is the wdmf for only those stars above 12,000k ( i.e. , the same as figure [ wdmfcomp ] ) renormalized to the same scale for comparison purposes .",
    "there are more high mass stars in general , and one spurriously large bin , but on the whole , our log @xmath1 correction recovers a reasonable mass distribution for stars cooler than 12,000k .",
    "figure [ allwdlf ] shows the luminosity function we derive for all of the da stars in our sample down to 7,000k for all stars with @xmath38 . in red",
    "is the lf for the data as reported ; in black is the lf for the data with the increase in log @xmath1 at low temperature removed .",
    "the process of removing the excess log @xmath1 pushes stars to lower masses , making them larger and therefore brighter for the same @xmath7 . in the range plotted , the black curve contains a total of 3,358 wds , while the red contains 2,940 .",
    "the lack of agreement between our best lf ( black ) and the @xcite luminosity function ( blue ) can be attributed , at least in part , to the differing assumptions used in creating the two lfs .",
    "harris et al .",
    "derived their temperatures by fitting bergeron models to the photometry assuming a log @xmath1 of 8.0 for every star , a poor assumption for more than 30% of wds @xcite .",
    "the temperatures they derive are systematically different from the spectroscopic temperatures ; figure [ tcompfig ] shows the fractional difference between the spectroscopically and photometrically derived effective temperatures . when we use the photometrically derived temperatures and set log @xmath39 , we recover the harris et al .",
    "lf fairly well .",
    "it should also be noted that the harris et al .",
    "luminosity function is for wds of @xmath40 types , whereas ours is comprised only of the das . for each bin in the harris et al .",
    "lf , we have used the full @xcite catalog to determine a rough da fraction , and reduced the lf reported of harris et al . accordingly . this da fraction  shown in table 1is in generally good agreement with previous works @xcite , but we have made no attempt to address selection biases in the eisenstein et al .",
    "catalog .",
    "one other source of the discrepancy between our results and harris et al .",
    "is due to our assumption that whatever causes the observed upturn in log @xmath1 in the cooler stars affects only the log @xmath1 determination and does not alter the spectroscopically derived @xmath7 .",
    "as the effects of the two parameters on the line profiles are interdependent , this assumption is probably not valid .",
    "the curves in figure [ allwdlf ] suggest that in addition to the excess log @xmath1 , the temperatures determined by line fitting for the cooler stars are probably too high .",
    "ultimately , this area of the spectroscopic wdlf will remain uncertain until the problems with the model atmospheres have been resolved .",
    "the lf of @xcite shown in green in figure [ allwdlf ] was compiled from a small dataset ( 348 da white dwarfs ) based on a survey done on photographic plates over 20 years ago on a 0.5 m telescope .",
    "in addition to low number statistics , the dataset suffers from a very difficult - to - quantify incompleteness on the faint end , which is probably responsible for the lack of agreement below @xmath41 .",
    "our eventual goal is to take advantage of the tremendous number of wds spectroscopically observed by sdss and studied by @xcite and others to create separate wd luminosity functions for two or more different ranges of mass .",
    "this will effectively add a third dimension , currently unexplored , to observational wd luminosity functions .    in order to carry out this analysis",
    ", we must fully understand the manner in which white dwarfs were selected to receive spectra in sdss . by comparing the proper - motion selected sample of @xcite with the spectroscopically determined wds of @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we have derived a wd selection probability over a range of parameters that includes nearly the entire useful range of @xmath0 color ( @xmath2 ) and apparent @xmath1 magnitude ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we have also presented additional arguments that the observed upturn in log @xmath1 is an artifact of the model atmosphere line - fitting procedure , or ",
    "more likely  a problem with the line profiles themselves .",
    "since it may be some time before this problem is fully understood and addressed , we have implemented a procedure to remove the excess log @xmath1 empirically and shown that the mass function recovered for the stars cooler than 12,000k reasonably agrees with the mf for the hotter stars , which in turn agrees well with previous work .",
    "finally , we have presented the first wdlf for spectroscopically determined wds in the fourth data release of the sdss .",
    "in addition to addressing the issues of completeness and the observed log @xmath1 upturn in a more systematic manner than previously attempted , our lf contains the largest sample of spectroscopically determined wds to date ( 3,358 ) , more than six times the 531 presented in @xcite , and more than an order of magnitude more than the 298 stars included in the lf of @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank scot kleinman for providing unpublished fits of the da white dwarfs ; hugh harris and mukremin kilic for access to the data and code used to derive the @xcite luminosity function , as well as much helpful advice ; barbara canstanheira , elizabeth jeffery , agnes kim , mike montgomery , fergal mullally , and kurtis williams for many interesing and insightful discussions .",
