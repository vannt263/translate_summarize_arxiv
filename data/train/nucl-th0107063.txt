    "the photoproduction of @xmath7- and @xmath8-mesons on nucleons , @xmath9 , near threshold @xmath2 gev , is considered typically as a possible way for the study of the physics of nucleon resonances @xmath10 in the interesting dense region of its masses , @xmath11 gev , where @xmath12 is the nucleon ( vector meson ) mass . especially , such experiments could be interesting for the search and subsequent study of the so - called missing resonances @xcite .",
    "typical opinion here is that due to possible large width of the decay @xmath13 , the reactions of vector meson photoproduction on nucleons will be sensitive to these resonances .",
    "therefore , the future intensive flux of new data from jlab will be effective for the solution of this problem .",
    "multipole analysis of experimental data about different observables in processes @xmath14 can be realized only in the case of an appropriate and a realistic model for the nonresonant mechanisms for @xmath14 .",
    "this is especially important for the photoproduction of neutral vector mesons , where @xmath10 contributions do not seem as the main ones @xcite .    in the literature @xcite",
    "the following nonresonant mechanisms are discussed : the pseudoscalar ( @xmath3,@xmath15 ) and scalar ( @xmath4 ) exchanges in t - channel , one nucleon exchanges in s- and u - channels , and pomeron exchange .",
    "this introduces a large enough set of unknown parameters , characterizing different contributions , such as the coupling constants , their relative phases , and the cut - off parameters of numerous phenomenological form factors , as well . in principle",
    "different combinations of these ingredients are presented in the literature .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite the model for @xmath16 contains the following two contributions : ( @xmath17)-exchanges in t - channel ; with specific form factors in electromagnetic and strong vertices of pole diagrams . the same nonresonant background , i.e. @xmath18-exchanges , is also considered in ref.@xcite , with the same coupling constants but with different form factors .",
    "the corresponding model in ref.@xcite contains three ingredients : @xmath18-exchanges in t - channel , ( s+u)-channel one - nucleon contribution and pomeron exchange .",
    "our aim here is to suggest a simple enough model for the process @xmath19 in the near threshold region which will describe relatively well the existing experimental data @xcite about differential cross sections for @xmath20 and will produce nontrivial polarization phenomena , more rich , for example , than in the case of @xmath18-exchange . for such exchanges almost all polarization phenomena",
    "are trivial and can be predicted without knowledge of exact values of the coupling constants and phenomenological form factors .",
    "for example , the beam asymmetry @xmath21 induced by the linear polarization of the photon beam , and all possible t - odd polarization observables such as , for example , target asymmetry or polarization of final proton produced in collisions of unpolarized particles will be zero identically for any kinematical conditions of the considered reaction .",
    "analogously , it is possible to predict that @xmath22 , and all other elements of the @xmath7-meson density matrix must be zero .",
    "let us note also that @xmath18-model will not produce any difference in cross section on proton and neutron targets due to the absence of @xmath4- and @xmath3-interference .",
    "but the suggested model in this work will be more rich and more flexible , allowing to predict nontrivial polarization phenomena .",
    "such model ( @xmath23 ) will be suitable enough as starting point for the discussion of possible contribution of nucleon resonances . and presence of different interference contributions such as @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the differential cross section even with unpolarized particles will be important for establishing relative signs of coupling constants",
    ". that will be crucial for more complete information about these constants , which is necesssary for prediction of polarization phenomena .",
    "for t - channel , we consider the pseudoscalar ( @xmath3 ) , and scalar ( @xmath4 ) exchanges , shown in fig.1a .",
    "the pseudoscalar exchange amplitudes can be obtained from the lagrangian , @xmath26 where and @xmath27(@xmath28 ) is the photon ( vector meson ) field . then , one - pion exchange amplitude takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the mass of @xmath0-meson , @xmath32 is the polarization four vector of photon(vector meson ) .",
    "notation of particle four momenta is presented in fig .",
    "1 . we shall use the coupling constants as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath35 is obtained from the experimental partial width of @xmath0 radiative decay @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the form factors used in our calculations are @xmath37 where @xmath38  gev and @xmath39  gev @xcite .",
    "the scalar ( @xmath4 ) exchange amplitude can be obtained from the lagrangian , @xmath40 the above lagrangian leads to the following expression for scalar exchange amplitude : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the coupling constants for the vertices @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , they are taken as @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the form factors for this exchange mechanism are given by @xmath48 where @xmath49  gev and @xmath50  gev @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for vnn and @xmath51 interactions can be written in the following way : @xmath52 where we use the notation @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the s- and u - channel amplitudes can then be obtained by using the above lagrangian as @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the vector and tensor coupling constants for @xmath63-vertex , @xmath64 is the electric charge for proton(neutron ) , @xmath65 is the anomalous magnetic moment of proton(neutron),and @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 .",
    "the values of the coupling constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 will be given in the next section .",
    "let us note that the suggested model for the matrix element of the process @xmath68 namely @xmath69= @xmath70 satisfies the gauge invariance of hadron electromagnetic interaction at any values of the coupling constants and form factors in the whole region of kinematical variables s and t. futhermore , we like to mention that we do not introduce any form factor in @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "problem here is that in general the form factors for @xmath71 and @xmath72 must be different , having s- or u - dependences , respectively .",
    "but this `` natural '' form factors will destroy the gauge invariance of s+u contribution to the total matrix element for @xmath73 . in principle , it is possible to introduce some common phenomenological form factor in front of @xmath74 @xcite with s- and u- dependences simultaneously as f(s , u ) .",
    "such a `` form factor '' f(s , u ) , depending on two variables seems more like as some amplitude , but not as form factor which typically depends on one variable .",
    "so this dependence differs from the case of t - channel where the corresponding form factors are the functions of t - variable only .",
    "another point which must be stressed here concerns the values of the coupling constants , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for the vertex @xmath77 .",
    "typical way in the literature is to use for these constants information from nn - interaction @xcite or pion photoproduction processes , @xmath78 @xcite , where vector meson exchange plays some role .",
    "but the case we consider , @xmath68 , on one hand , and @xmath79 , for example , on the other hand , are controlled by the vnn - constants in the different regimes of vector meson momentum : space - like in the case of nn - interaction or @xmath78 and time - like for @xmath68 .",
    "therefore to connect @xmath79 and @xmath68 , a long extrapolation in momentum transfer must be done .",
    "so vnn - coupling constants for these cases could be essentially different . and another important difference in vnn - constants from different processes , which must be mentioned here , concerns the high virtuality of one of the nucleons for the vnn - vertex in the case of processes @xmath68 .",
    "these comments could be considered as some justification of our strategy in the consideration of these coupling constants : namely , we shall consider these constants as free parameters , whose values must be adjusted by some fit to the existing experimental data about differential cross sections for process @xmath20 in the near threshold region .",
    "moreover , in our consideration here we will neglect the pomeron contribution to the matrix element for @xmath68 in the near threshold region , @xmath2 gev .",
    "it is possible to justify such approach by observation that the pomeron , being as an effective high energy phenomenological phenomenon , does not seem as the adequate mechanism in the near threshold region .",
    "for example , in another processes , where the pomeron exchange is allowed definitely , such as the elastic @xmath80 , @xmath81 or n+n - scattering @xcite , its contribution is considered typically at higher values of invariant variable s in comparison with the near threshold values of s for @xmath82 .",
    "for example , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , but it is evident that in @xmath79 the pomeron exchange is taken into account at more higher w - values .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to find some specific theoretical reasons to justify the pomeron exchange in the threshold region for processes @xmath9 .",
    "this region can be considered as the transition regime from the contributions of s - channel nucleon resonances to the regge approach in accordance with the duality hypothesis @xcite .",
    "namely , in this region there is the delicate problem of double counting if both above mentioned contributions are considered simultaneously .",
    "therefore , to avoid this problem we will not consider the pomeron contribution in the near threshold region @xmath85 gev , for @xmath86 .",
    "we do not consider in our work the nucleon resonances as well .",
    "diffractive - like behaviour of the differential cross sections for @xmath87 processes even very near to the threshold can be considered as some indication that this mechanism can not be main one here .",
    "for example , the analysis in the quark model of the contribution of large number of nucleon resonances demonstrated that they can not reproduce such diffractive t - dependence @xcite .",
    "let us note that the contribution of nucleon resonance @xmath10 with the definite value of spin j and parity p , @xmath88 , to the amplitude of @xmath9 process is complicated generally , being characterized by six independent constants or partial amplitudes , for @xmath89 .",
    "these amplitudes correspond to two possible initial @xmath90-states with the electric and magnetic multipolarities of real photons in the chain of the transitions : @xmath91 and three different final @xmath92-states with definite combinations of total vn spin , @xmath93 and 3/2 , and the orbital angular momentum of the vector meson .",
    "even for @xmath94 there are two independent transitions , i.e. the situation with @xmath10 in processes @xmath9 is more complicated in comparison with @xmath95 or @xmath96 , where the @xmath10 contribution with some @xmath88 is characterized by two multipole amplitudes only .    in the case of the breit - wigner parametrization of the @xmath10 contribution to the matrix element for @xmath9 process , each such contribution",
    "is characterized by five constants : two electromagnetic ones , magnetic and electric , and three strong constants for the decay @xmath97 . in principle , it is possible to use information about the electromagnetic vertex , @xmath98 , from the multipole analysis of processes @xmath99 .",
    "so , the processes @xmath9 will be used for the study of the spin structure of strong vertices : @xmath97 .",
    "but it is not the case for the missing resonances , with the small @xmath100 branching ratio , i.e. with a weak signal in @xmath95 , with unknown electromagnetic constants .",
    "it is evident that the successful solution of the missing resonance problem , using the processes @xmath101 , needs a large amount of polarization data with polarized beam , polarized target , with measurements of polarization properties of produced vector mesons . only in that case",
    "the corresponding multipole analysis can be done more or less uniquely .",
    "we like to note that the suggested model here produces real amplitudes and as a result all possible t - odd polarization observables must be identically zero , independently on the relative role of the considered mechanisms .",
    "but @xmath10-contribution in s - channel will change the situation qualitatively , introducing a new essential property , namely complexity of amplitudes with a rich t - odd polarization phenomena",
    ". therefore these observables will be especially sensitive to possible @xmath10-contribution to the matrix element for @xmath20 .",
    "even not so intensive @xmath10-contribution , through its interference with large @xmath4-contribution , can produce a detectable signal in target asymmetry , for example .",
    "but before that the following problem must be solved : are there some other sources of amplitude complexity in the near threshold region for @xmath1 ?",
    "evidently the complex pomeron exchange through its specific signature can not be considered as a good mechanism near threshold .",
    "of course , it is necessary to keep in mind final vn - interaction , which will modify the real @xmath3 and @xmath4 contributions . this way we will not meet the delicate problem of double counting in the case of additional @xmath10-contributions .    in any case",
    ", the problem of missing resonances in @xmath102 , being as very interesting , will introduce necessity of solution of some serious problems . and",
    "one such problem is the choice of the adequate model for the nonresonant mechanism in @xmath103 @xmath104 , where namely this nonresonant background is the main mechanism in the near threshold region .",
    "intensive study of polarization phenomena in @xmath105 will be very important to successful solution of this and another related problems .    and we must repeat here once more , that the finding an adequate model for the nonresonant contributions to the matrix element for @xmath86 in the near threshold region is an important task , especially taking into account the numerous number of possible @xmath10 with many fitting free parameters .",
    "interference of different mechanisms must be intensive enough , and that will introduce additional problem of relative phases of different contributions .",
    "even such relatively simple model contains large number of unknown parameters : @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath4-meson mass in principle can also be considered as a parameter , being limited in the wide interval : @xmath112 mev @xcite .",
    "only two coupling constants , namely @xmath113 and @xmath35 can be considered as well known .",
    "evidently any attempt to find all these parameters by fitting the limited set of experimental data concerning only differential cross section for process @xmath114 , with unpolarized particles , can not be successful .",
    "therefore we follow the literature tradition @xcite , and we will fix all four cut - off parameters , @xmath115 , choosing their values as it was indicated in sec .",
    "2 .    after this",
    "we have only three parameters , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath110 , assuming @xmath116 , as it follows from nn - interaction @xcite .",
    "we fit our model with all the @xmath117 data from saphir collaboration at three energy intervals : @xmath118 gev , @xmath119 gev , @xmath120 gev .",
    "note that we choose the `` standard value '' for @xmath4-mass : @xmath121 mev , evidently another value of @xmath122 from allowed wide interval can change the results of fitting .",
    "we choose specially only the above three mentioned from existing six energy intervals for @xmath117 , measured by saphir collaboration @xcite , to have the possibility to predict @xmath117 for another three energy intervals , and to test in some sense the validity of the suggested model .",
    "the best results for the fitted coupling constants are the following two sets of coupling constants : @xmath123 , @xmath124 for the fixed value of coupling constant @xmath110 , namely , @xmath125 , following ref . @xcite and @xmath126 , @xmath127,@xmath128 . in the last case we consider @xmath110 as a fitting parameter , as well .",
    "this allows to obtain some conclusions , concerning the proposed model .",
    "\\(1 ) first of all , we can see that @xmath129 of ref .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath110 can not be determined in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite because in that model @xmath130 , i.e. there is no @xmath131-interference contribution .",
    "but in the model we consider it is possible in principle to determine relative signs of coupling constants , for example , to the sign of @xmath3-contribution , i.e. choosing for the product @xmath132 the positive value .",
    "\\(2 ) the resulting values for the coupling constants , @xmath133 and @xmath62 , are different from their standard values , which have been found early from nn - potential @xcite , where typically , they are ranging from 2.97 to 3.16 for @xmath61 and 12.5 to 20.8 for @xmath62 we must repeat here once more that such difference could be considered as natural due to the large difference in momentum transfer .    to characterize the quality of our fit ,",
    "let us mention that the @xmath134-value for the set of constants given above is @xmath135 for the second set and 2.5 for the first set .",
    "we note that in the interval @xmath136 there are a lot of comparable minima in @xmath134 as a function of the three coupling constants .",
    "this means a large correlation between these constants , due to not so large sensitivity of @xmath117 to the details of the considered model .    using both",
    "these fits we predict the t - dependence of @xmath137 for three another energy intervals @xmath138 gev , @xmath139 gev , @xmath140 gev which were not used in our fits , and we compare them with the experimental results in fig . 2 for two sets of @xmath63 and @xmath141-coupling constants .",
    "in the same figure , we also show our fits for the other three energy intervals .",
    "one can see that both fits are good enough for all measured differential cross sections for @xmath2 gev . only for the smallest energy with central value @xmath142 gev the predicted cross sections are larger than the experimental values , such discrepancy could be considered as some indication of possible contribution of nucleon resonances .",
    "the contributions of different amplitudes to @xmath143 at @xmath144  gev are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    in any case , one can state that in the considered energy region @xmath2 gev the existing experimental data about differential cross sections can be described relatively well in the framework of a simple model with small number of adjustable parameters . and",
    "the quality of the existing experimental data allows different models without strong preference of some of them as compared to many another possible models .",
    "even our simplified ( @xmath23)model can be realized with at least by two different possibilities with different values of @xmath145 and @xmath110 coupling constants .",
    "so , the available experimental data on @xmath5 is consistently well described in ( @xmath23)approach , and these data are not so discriminative to the details of different possible such type models .",
    "another case is the polarization phenomena , even the simplest of them , for example , the beam asymmetry @xmath21 induced by linear photon polarization @xmath146 with @xmath147 , induced by photon with polarization orthogonal ( parallel ) to reaction plane , is sensitive to reaction mechanism .",
    "being equal to zero identically for @xmath18-exchange , this t - even polarization observable must be discriminative to the relative value of other contributions . and",
    "this is demonstrated in fig . 4 for proton target , where we present the predicted values of @xmath21 for the saphir energies .",
    "we see that two sets of coupling constants result in @xmath21 which are different in sign for the whole interval of t , demonstrating the importance of the n - contribution , and especially @xmath148-interference .",
    "so the future measurement of @xmath21-asymmetry even at one energy and at one angle will be very decisive in the choice of the correct reaction mechanism or in the set of nonresonant background mechanisms .",
    "photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons on the neutron target , @xmath149 , will be interesting also , especially in the near threshold region .",
    "point here is that the n - contribution , being controlled by the coupling constants , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , will be different due to different electromagnetic characteristics of neutron and proton .",
    "this also results in different interference @xmath24 contribution to all observables for processes , @xmath152 and @xmath149 , such as the differential cross section and beam asymmetry .",
    "the predicted behaviour of beam asymmetry for @xmath153 is presented in fig .",
    "we also note that the ratio of differential cross sections ( @xmath154 is sensitive to the set of vector coupling constants , especially at large value of momentum transfer @xmath155 , with evident deviation of r from unity , in contrary directions for the considered sets of coupling constants , as shown in fig .",
    "although we found good fit in our model , even two fits with different sets of coupling constants , to the existing data about differential cross sections for process , @xmath156 , in the near threshold region @xmath2 gev , we do not consider our results to be decisive . indeed",
    ", we miss here some `` traditional '' contributions , such as for example the nucleon resonances in s - channel .",
    "there is no any strong proof that the suggested model for the nonresonant background is more suitable in comparison with another possible approaches @xcite .",
    "we can only say that our model is relatively simple , being free from consideration of such high - energy ingredients as the pomeron exchange . in any case",
    "the suggested model produces nontrivial polarization phenomena .",
    "we note that the value of coupling constants @xmath157 which are controlled by n - contribution to the matrix element of @xmath158 proces must be different generally from the values for these constants that follow from nn - interaction . and the values of @xmath159-coupling constants in the time - like region of @xmath0-momentum can find a lot of applications in consideration of another process with vector meson production . clearly , and not only for our analysis , additional polarization data , about asymmetry @xmath21 for example , will help to establish more uniquely the models for @xmath160 . and",
    "this is unavoidable as a way in the solution of missing resonance problem .",
    "following are the main conclusions of our study and some general remarks .",
    "@xmath161 it is shown that the relatively simple model ( @xmath162 ) can explain the saphir data about the differential cross section for @xmath163 , @xmath2 gev , and therefore could be considered as a good nonresonant background mechanism for searching the missing nucleon resonances .",
    "@xmath161 results for the vnn - coupling constants , their absolute values and the signs as well , @xmath164 , considered in our work as a fitting parameters , depend on the value of @xmath110-coupling constant .    @xmath161 the simplest polarization observable , namely the beam asymmetry @xmath21 , is especially sensitive to possible variation of parameters of our models in some limits , for which the differential cross section is not so discriminative",
    ".    @xmath161 the ratio of differential cross sections of @xmath0-photoproduction on proton and neutron targets are sensitive to the discussed variants of the suggested model .    in any case , the vnn - coupling constants from the fit to @xmath165 in the near threshold region are different in absolute values and in signs from the so called `` standard '' values of these constants , which have been extracted from the data about nn - interaction or pion production , @xmath166 , due to essential difference in momentum transfer .    in principle our estimation for the coupling constants @xmath133 and @xmath62 will be useful for analysis of another processes of vector meson production , such as for example , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 etc . , in the framework of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "@xmath161 our fitting procedure demonstrates that even the differential cross sections are sensitive to the relative sign of the different contributions to the matrix element of the process , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath161 cut - off parameters @xmath115 of above mentioned phenomenological form factors , which typically must be introduced in electromagnetic and strong vertexes of the considered pole diagrams , must be object of special consideration , because such universality i.e. , applicability of the same form factors for different process is not proved rigorously .",
    "it is only a very simplified procedure .",
    "we thank m. p. rekalo for suggesting this problem to us and we gratefully acknowledge his guidance and fruitful discussions during the course of our work .",
