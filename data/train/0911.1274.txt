    "<S> the prediction of the spin of the black hole resulting from the merger of a generic black - hole binary system is of great importance to study the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> several attempts have been recently made to model the spin via simple expressions exploiting the results of numerical - relativity simulations . </S>",
    "<S> here , i first review the derivation of a formula , proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which accurately predicts the final spin magnitude and direction when applied to binaries with separations of hundred or thousands of gravitational radii . </S>",
    "<S> this makes my formula particularly suitable for cosmological merger - trees and n - body simulations , which provide the spins and angular momentum of the two black holes when their separation is of thousands of gravitational radii . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , i investigate the physical reason behind the good agreement between my formula and numerical relativity simulations , and nail it down to the fact that my formula takes into account the post - newtonian precession of the spins and angular momentum in a consistent manner .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of black - hole ( bh ) binaries is a very complex problem which has been solved only very recently through time - expensive numerical - relativity ( nr ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been shown that the dimensionless spin of the remnant from a bh binary merger , @xmath0 , can be described with simple prescriptions based on point particles  @xcite , on fits to the nr data  @xcite , or on a combination of the two approaches  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these formulas are useful because they provide information over the entire 7-dimensional space of parameters for bh binaries in quasi - circular orbits , namely : the mass ratio @xmath1 and the six components of the initial dimensionless spin vectors @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> such parameter space could in principle be investigated entirely via nr calculations ; in practice , however , the simulations are very expensive and restricted to @xmath3@xmath4 . also , these formulas have applications in astrophysics , where they could provide information on the properties of massive - star binary systems ; in cosmology , where supermassive bhs ( smbhs ) are believed to assemble through accretion and mergers ; in gravitational - wave astronomy , where the _ a priori _ knowledge of the final spin can help the detection .    </S>",
    "<S> while the different expressions for the spin norm , @xmath5 , are in good agreement with the results of nr simulations , the predictions for the final spin direction , @xmath6 , do not agree well with one another and are all essentially _ imprecise _ when the binaries are widely separated . </S>",
    "<S> this is because all expressions are built from and model the typical nr binaries and hence the dynamics of the last few orbits before the merger . because it does not account systematically for the precession of the orbital angular momentum @xmath7 , the prediction for @xmath8 depends on the separation of the binary and is therefore of little use for applications , such as cosmological merger - trees or n - body simulations , that provide the spins of the two bhs at separations of thousands of gravitational radii . </S>",
    "<S> although one could use the pn equations to evolve a widely - separated binary to a separation of few gravitational radii and then apply the formulas , this makes the formulas difficult to use and implement . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we followed instead a different approach and showed that it is possible to derive a formula for the final spin that takes into account the precession of the spins and that is , therefore , applicable to binaries with arbitrary separations .    the derivation of the formula , for more details about which we refer the reader to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is based on the following assumptions :    _ ( i ) when the spins are parallel to @xmath7 ( either aligned or antialigned ) , the formula must reduce to the fit of the nr results presented in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , namely _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the symmetric mass ratio , @xmath11 , and , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 must satisfy the constraint @xmath16 which follows from the results obtained by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for equal - mass non - spinning bhs . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17    _ ( ii ) the mass @xmath18 radiated to gravitational waves can be neglected _ _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _  @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason why assumption _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ is reasonable here is that @xmath18 is largest for aligned binaries but these are also the ones fitted by expression  . in this way , the mass losses are automatically accounted for by the values of the coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the norms @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 do not depend on the separation of the binary @xmath24 _ , with @xmath25 being @xmath26= \\boldsymbol{l}(r)-\\boldsymbol{j}_{\\rm rad}(r)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the spins and the orbital angular momentum at the separation @xmath24 and @xmath30 is the angular momentum radiated from @xmath24 to the merger . while the constancy of @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a very good assumption for bhs , the constancy of @xmath23 is heuristic and based on the idea that the merger takes place at an `` effective '' innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , so that @xmath23 can be interpreted as the residual orbital angular momentum contributing to @xmath31 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) the final spin @xmath31 is parallel to the initial total angular momentum @xmath32 . _ _ </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) the angle between @xmath7 and @xmath33 and the angle between @xmath34 and @xmath34 are constant during the inspiral , although @xmath7 and @xmath35 precess around @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> _    assumptions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are motivated by the pn approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it has been in fact shown by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that within the adiabatic approximation the secular angular - momentum losses via gravitational radiation are along @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because as @xmath7 rotates around @xmath36 , the emission orthogonal to @xmath36 averages out . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath35 and @xmath7 essentially precess around the direction @xmath39 , which remains nearly constant ( _ cf . _ the detailed discussion in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , and the angle between @xmath7 and @xmath35 and that between the two spins remain constant as well .    _ </S>",
    "<S> ( vi ) when the initial spin vectors are equal and opposite and the masses are equal , the spin of the final bh is the same as for nonspinning binaries_. besides being physically reasonable  if the spins are equal and opposite , their contributions are expected to cancel out  this assumption is confirmed by nr simulations and by the leading - order pn spin - spin and spin - orbit couplings .    </S>",
    "<S> these assumptions are sufficient to derive an expression for both the magnitude and the direction of the final spin  @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the final spin norm is given by @xmath40^{1/2 } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and the angles @xmath42 and @xmath43 are defined by @xmath44 the angle @xmath45 between the final spin and the initial orbital angular momentum @xmath46 is instead @xmath47    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to highlight the role played by the precession of the spins in the prediction of the final spin direction , in the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : evolution ] we focus on the binary `` sp3 '' of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( index @xmath48 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : combo ] ) . in this configuration </S>",
    "<S> the spins precess strongly and the final spin flips relative to @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath34 and @xmath50 are initially parallel , orthogonal to @xmath7 and have : @xmath51 , @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the filled hexagon in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : evolution ] is the numerical result as obtained with an initial separation @xmath53 , while different lines show the angle @xmath45 obtained with the various formulas as a function of the binary separation . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , using the initial conditions of the nr simulation we have evolved the `` sp3 '' binary back in time using the pn equations up to a separation of @xmath54 , applying the various formulas at each step to compute @xmath55 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the line `` pn+nr '' reports instead the angle @xmath56 $ ] . in the right panel </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the configuration `` q13th00 '' of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( index @xmath4 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : combo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this configuration features a smaller , non - spinning bh and a larger , spinning bh with spin @xmath57 lying on the equatorial plane and orthogonal to the separation ( @xmath58 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mass ratio is @xmath59 , which makes this binary interesting as it allows to test the behavior of the various formulas in a region of parameter space which so far has been sampled only sparsely by nr simulations , which usually deal with @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is because the cost of a nr simulation grows as @xmath61 , a factor @xmath62 coming from the slow inspiral of a small mass ratio binary , and another factor @xmath62 appearing because if the mass ratio is small , one needs much resolution to resolve the two very different scales of the problem . )    </S>",
    "<S> three results are clear from these comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> first : all previous formulas provide a reasonable estimate of @xmath45 but only when the binary has a separation @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> second : only our formula provides a reasonable estimate at all separations ; indeed , the `` pn+nr '' results are reproduced to within the accuracy of the nr simulation , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _  2 - 3 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> all the other formulas , instead , predict the same value for @xmath64 for all @xmath65 , because they take as an input the angles @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are constant under the quasi - circular pn evolution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the other formulas become rapidly become imprecise when the binary s separation increases , reaching errors as large as 60 degrees for @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> third : the error of the old formulas when applied to large separation binaries is larger for small mass ratio systems ( _ e.g. _  the maximum error is @xmath69 degree for the comparable - mass configuration sp3 , while it is @xmath70 degrees for the small mass - ratio binary q13th00 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this had to be expected , again on the grounds that the old formulas predict the same @xmath45 for all @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> as a result of this , in fact , the maximum error of the old formulas is roughly given by their prediction for @xmath45 at small separations , because the correct @xmath45 becomes small for large @xmath65 ( _ cf . </S>",
    "<S> _ the `` pn+nr '' curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : evolution ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction can be very large for small @xmath71 if the angle between @xmath72 and @xmath73 at small separations is large . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily understood by noting that at small separations the old formulas give roughly the same results as our formula : therefore , for @xmath74 their prediction is @xmath75 [ because for @xmath74 , @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that such a good agreement between our formula and the data for the final spin , irrespective of the separation of the binary to which the formula is applied , emerges because we have consistently taken into account the effect of precession through assumptions _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) _ and _ ( v ) _ , while that effect is not accounted for in the other formulas . for instance , in our earlier formula of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( `` aeiold '' ) , assumptions _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) _ and _ ( v ) _ were replaced by the assumption that the angular momentum emitted during the inspiral is parallel to @xmath46 [ _ cf . </S>",
    "<S> _ assumption _ ( iii ) _ of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is not true unless one neglects spin - orbit precession ( as was indeed stressed explicitly in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a similar assumption was also made in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite admittedly recognized that their formula might not be valid at arbitrary separations , as it is based on a fit to nr simulations , which , as already mentioned , have initial separations @xmath77 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> : i have reviewed the assumptions needed to derive a new formula predicting the spin of the bh resulting from the merger of two bhs in quasi - circular orbits and having arbitrary initial masses and spins  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this formula includes the effect of the precession of the spins through assumptions _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) _ and _ ( v ) _ , and can therefore be applied to widely separated binaries , such as those relevant for cosmological applications , for which the other available formulas become imprecise . </S>",
    "<S> i stress that requiring that the formulas for the final spin work also when applied to large separation binaries is necessary to ensure that these formulas can be readily used in cosmological applications . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological simulations typically provide the initial spins and angular momentum of smbh binaries when their separation is still of about 0.1 pc ( see ref .  @xcite for a recent example ) , which corresponds to @xmath78 if @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this separation roughly corresponds to the point at which the evolution of the binary starts being driven by gravitational - wave emission . while it would be in principle possible to use the pn equations and evolve the widely - separated binaries provided by cosmological simulations to small separations , read - off the relevant information and apply the formulas for the final spin , this procedure would be impractical and potentially very time - consuming ( _ cf . _ again ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which simulates tens of thousands of smbh binaries in order to get significant statistics ) .    </S>",
    "<S> i am grateful to my coauthor l. rezzolla for countless discussions on the issues examined in this contribution . </S>",
    "<S> i also acknowledge support from nsf grant phy-0603762 . </S>"
