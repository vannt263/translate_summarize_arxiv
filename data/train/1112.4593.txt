    "one of the most common materials of the dilatant fluid is a dense mixture of cornstarch and water , and it can be used to demonstrate a number of counter - intuitive behaviors that the shear thickening medium shows : sudden solidification upon externally applied stress , quick re - fluidization after removal of the stress , formation of holes and protrusions under strong vibration@xcite , etc .",
    "these behaviors come from severe shear thickening and hysteresis , that dense colloid or dense mixture of granules and liquid often show .",
    "the shear viscosity increases almost discontinuously by orders of magnitude at a certain critical shear rate@xcite , which makes the fluid almost rigid against the sudden application of stress .",
    "it is called a `` dilatant fluid '' by analogy with the behavior of a granular medium@xcite ; when a granular medium is densely packed in a bag that is flexible but non - stretchable , it can not be deformed because the volume is constant .",
    "the granular medium must dilate upon deformation due to the _ principle of dilatancy _ by reynolds@xcite .",
    "there are several peculiar features in the shear thickening of the dilatant fluid : ( i ) the thickening is so severe and instantaneous that it might be used even to make a body armor to stop a bullet@xcite , ( ii ) the relaxation after removal of the external stress occurs within a few seconds , that is quick but not as instantaneous as in the thickening process , ( iii ) the medium in the thickened state behaves like a rigid material allowing little elastic deformation as long as it is under stress , ( iv ) the viscosity shows hysteresis upon changing the shear rate@xcite , ( v ) noisy fluctuations have been observed in the response to an external shear stress in the thickening regime@xcite .    despite of the apparent analogy between the behaviors shown by these media ,",
    "it is not clear if the shear thickening of the dilatant fluid has something to do with the property of dilatancy of granular media .",
    "originally , the shear thickening in colloid systems were regarded as a result of the disorder transition of the layer and/or string structure developed in the low shear rate regime@xcite .",
    "the dispersed particles align due the shear flow to give shear thinning in low shear regime , but the turbulent motion in high shear regime destroys this structure to give shear thickening .",
    "such layer and/or string structures have been observed in numerical simulations@xcite and experiments@xcite , and in some cases the shear thickening occurs when the structure is broken@xcite . however , there are some other cases where no significant structure change are observed upon discontinuous shear thickening@xcite .",
    "hydrocluster formation has been proposed as an alternative origin of the shear thickening@xcite . due to hydrodynamic interaction among particles in the fluid",
    ", there is a certain condition that clusters of particles grow and they can give large viscosity .",
    "such a cluster structure of particles has been first identified in numerical simulations@xcite , then suggested by sans experiments@xcite .",
    "more direct observation has been made using fast confocal microscopy@xcite .",
    "jamming is another possibility under active debate in recent years in connection with the glass transition .",
    "in dense granular system , the jamming can cause the divergence of viscosity@xcite . in connection with the dilatancy , brown and jaeger studied the discontinuous shear thickening and obtained somewhat empirical constitutive relations@xcite .",
    "there are no microscopic theories for the dilatant fluid yet in the sense that the shear thickening is derived from the elementary interactions among constituents of the medium , i.e. granules and fluid , but there are a couple of semi - empirical theories : the soft - glassy rheology ( sgr ) model@xcite and the schematic mode coupling theory ( mct)@xcite . the sgr model is the model based on the stochastic dynamics with the activation energy that depends on the stress .",
    "this model is extended to describe the shear thickening by introducing the stress dependent effective temperature .",
    "mct , which gives reasonable description of the glass transition , has been extended schematically by introducing shear rate dependent integral kernel .",
    "both of the theories are semi - empirical and have been demonstrated to show the discontinuous shear thickening , but they have not been incorporated in the fluid dynamics to study its flowing behavior of the medium .",
    "recently , the present authors constructed a fluid dynamic model for the dilatant fluid by phenomenologically introducing an internal state variable , which determines the viscosity of the medium@xcite .",
    "the state variable itself is determined by the local stress@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present detailed study on the flowing property of the medium represented by the model .",
    "we demonstrate that the model shows the discontinuous shear thickening transition and the hysteresis upon changing the shear rate as has been observed in experiments .",
    "it is also shown that the steady shear flow becomes unstable for a certain parameter range against the shear thickening oscillation , where the medium alternates between the thickened and the relaxed states .",
    "the paper is organized as follow .",
    "the model is introduced in sec.2 , and it is examined for a simple uniform shear flow configuration in sec.3 . similar analysis is given for the gravitational slope flow and poiseuille flow in sec.4 .",
    "the response to an impact is simulated in sec.5 .",
    "effects of inhomogeneity is studied in sec.6 by two - dimensional simulations .",
    "summary and discussions are given in sec.7 .",

    "the time evolution of the viscosity distribution at @xmath93 is shown in fig.[inhomo - jam ] .",
    "initially , the viscosity is rather uniform with some fluctuations , but peak structure appears soon around @xmath164 with a certain characteristic length scale . some of the peaks grow sharply and the thickening regions strongly localize(@xmath165 ) , then the system is jammed and the flow stops within a period of oscillation of the homogeneous case(fig.[inhomo - u_p - jammed ] ) .     at @xmath93 at several times in the jamming regime .",

    "the fluctuation of @xmath13 first stands out just below the moving plates , but higher @xmath13 regions form band structure , and extend along the principal axis of the shear deformation , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "some of the bands reach the upper plate from the lower plate , and they jam the system .    , and ( b ) the maximum viscosity in the system presented in fig.[inhomo - jam ] .",
    "the dashed lines represent the oscillatory flow without fluctuations .",
    ", width=340 ]    in fig.[inhomo - u_p - jammed](a ) , we present the velocity of upper plate @xmath158 as a function of time . the solid line shows the time evolution starting from the internal state with fluctuations , and the dotted line represents the case without fluctuations for comparison .",
    "the state variable suddenly loses homogeneity at @xmath170 , then thickening branches appears , and the velocity @xmath158 drops to zero . the maximum viscosity is always found inside the thickening branch for @xmath171 , and its value sharply increases as plotted in fig.[inhomo - u_p - jammed](b ) .",
    "we can not simulate the system up to the time when the plates motion actually stops because the numerical time integration becomes difficult as the viscosity becomes large , since it requires smaller time step . in the present case , however , we expect the system is jammed because the decrease of @xmath158 and the increase of maximum viscosity are rapid and monotonic .",
    "the shear thickening shown by a dense mixture of granules and fluid has some peculiar features : ( i ) instantaneous hardening , ( ii ) fast relaxation to flowing state , ( iii ) rigid thickened state , ( iv ) hysteretic thickening transition , ( v ) oscillatory flowing behavior .",
    "we constructed a fluid dynamics model by introducing a phenomenological state variable and showed that the model can describe these features .",
    "especially , we demonstrated that _ the shear thickening oscillation _ appears in various shear flow configurations .      a visco - elastic fluid such as a polymer melt shows analogous behavior to the dilatant fluid ; it behaves like a solid in a short time scale and like a fluid in a long time scale .",
    "this may be compared with that of the dilatant fluid , i.e. instantaneous hardening in response to an external impact and fluidization after relaxation of the applied stress .",
    "however , there are some important differences ; the visco - elastic medium changes its behavior according to the observation time scale , and it also allows large elastic deformation even in a short time solid like behavior . on the other hand , the dilatant fluid changes its behavior according to the stress , i.e. it stays hardened while it is under the stress and starts flowing within a few second after the removal of the applied stress . the dilatant fluid allow little deformation even under large stress .      in constructing the model",
    ", we assume the fluid is _ shear - stress thickening _ , i.e. the viscosity depends upon the state variable @xmath13 , and the steady value of the state variable @xmath17 is determined by the local stress as in eq.([phi*(s ) ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to see what would happen if we assume @xmath17 as a function of the shear rate @xmath172 . in this case , the viscosity is directly given as a function of the shear rate , @xmath173 , thus we should not have a discontinuous thickening unless we assume a discontinuity either in @xmath172 or in @xmath174 .",
    "experimentally , the most direct evidence for the shear - stress thickening should be obtained by the observation that the pipe flow flux is not monotonically increasing as a function of the applied pressure gradient .",
    "although we introduced the state variable @xmath13 phenomenologically , we suppose that the variable represents a certain microscopic property of the medium , such as contact numbers between grains , associated with the restrictions against local rearrangement of granular configuration .",
    "the variable could be a vector or a tensor , but we examined the scalar case for simplicity .",
    "it is notable that even the scalar state variable produces the anisotropic stress chain like structure in the system as we have seen in the two - dimensional simulations .",
    "a remarkable feature of the dilatant fluid is that hardening response is so instantaneous that the medium can be used for a body armor to stop a bullet@xcite .",
    "we believe that such an instantaneous severe hardening can not be explained by a transformation between two steady states , i.e. from the fluid state under low stress to the rigid state under high stress . instead , it must be a result that the rapid rearrangement in the granular configuration is inhibited .",
    "there are two possible mechanisms that inhibit the granular rearrangement in the densely packed medium : the reynolds dilatancy and the formation of stress chains .",
    "the reynolds dilatancy can inhibit rearrangement by the fluid friction because the rearrangement should induce the strong interstitial fluid flow through granules in order to compensate the local volume change caused by the dilatancy .",
    "the stress chains through direct contacts between granules can be formed by the application external stress and prevent granules from being rearranged .    in the present model , such an aspect of hardening",
    "is represented by the fact that the relaxational time scale for the state change is not constant but proportional to the shear rate ( [ tau(gamma ) ] ) .",
    "then , the state variable @xmath13 reaches a steady value @xmath17 in a time scale where the strain changes by the amount @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , the medium with @xmath122 can deform only up to a certain strain around @xmath22 by a hard impact .",
    "one of interesting results of the present model is the shear thickening oscillation .",
    "the steady shear flow is unstable when the flow is in the unstable branch of the shear stress - shear rate curve and is wide enough compared to the diffusion length scale by the viscosity . in this case , the flow shows the oscillation between the thick state in the high shear regime and the thin state in the low shear regime . in two dimensions , uniform oscillation appears only in the smaller external shear stress region , but some oscillatory behavior remains even when inhomogeneity develops in the flow .",
    "the shear thickening oscillation in the homogeneous flow looks similar to the stick - slip motion in a frictional system .",
    "however , there are some important differences ; the stick - slip motion starts with the sudden acceleration caused by the slip weakening resistance under the constant speed driving through a mechanism with finite rigidity , while the shear thickening oscillation starts with the sudden deceleration caused by the shear thickening transition under the constant force driving .",
    "aradian and cates have also studied the dynamics of shear thickening fluids and found oscillatory behaviors@xcite .",
    "they focused , however , on the regime where the structural relaxation time is much larger than the fluid dynamical time scale , which is appropriate for liquid crystal systems .",
    "consequently , the time scale of the oscillation is of the order or larger than the structural relaxation time scale , therefore the dynamics is completely dissipative .",
    "on the other hand , in the present case , the structural relaxation time of the state variable is set by the shear rate and always comparable with the fluid dynamical time scale , thus the period of the oscillation is determined by the fluid dynamics .",
    "it is also clear that the stress from the inertia plays an important role in the thickening phase in the oscillation .      as for the hysteresis ,",
    "deegan observed the hysteresis loop of the viscosity under the oscillatory stress for the cornstarch - fluid system and considered it to be the mechanism for persistent holes@xcite .",
    "his system is thinner and in the regime of mild shear thickening in comparison with the system studied by fall et al@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we try to model rather severe shear thickening in choosing the functional form of the viscosity eq.([eta_phi ] ) , but the present model qualitatively reproduces main feature of his data , by adjusting the parameters for @xmath26 and @xmath22 ( fig.[osci - response ] compared with fig.5 of @xcite ) . for this set of the parameters , the initial noise decays ,",
    "thus the one and two dimensional simulations give the same results .      regarding the shear thickening oscillation",
    ", we could not find any literature on the experiment which shows clear oscillation .",
    "this may partly because the system needs to be large enough , typically wider than @xmath38 or a few centimeters , and the inhomogeneity may develops in three dimensional system , which can obscure the oscillation .",
    "the noisy fluctuation often observed in rheometer experiments under constant stress may be explained by this mechanism@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one may easily notice the oscillation around 10 hz simply by pouring the dense water - starch mixture out of a container .",
    "we believe that this oscillation should be explained by the shear thickening oscillation .",
    "we are planning experiments that allow quantitative comparison with our results .",
    "although in the different physical context , the clear oscillatory flows@xcite along with a discontinuous transition and hysteresis@xcite have been observed in the liquid crystal system that shows the shear thinning due to the state dependent viscosity .",
    "such behavior could be also described using the phenomenological model like the present one .",
    "chaotic dynamics has been observed in dilute aqueous solutions of a surfactant in the experiment under the constant shear rate in the shear thickening regime@xcite .",
    "it was interpreted as the stick - slip transition between the two states of the fluid structure , thus physical relevance to the present instability is not clear , but we also found the chaotic dynamics in the present model in the case of the constant relaxation time @xmath19 with the large system width ."
