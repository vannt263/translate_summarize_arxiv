    "the term geometrical frustration@xcite applies to a system , when it is unable to simultaneously minimize all of its magnetic exchange interactions , solely due to its geometry .",
    "magnetically interacting spins residing on such lattices are unable to order into a unique magnetic ground state due to the competing magnetic interactions between different lattice sites . instead of selecting a single , unique magnetic ground state at low temperatures ,",
    "a pure magnetically frustrated system has a macroscopically degenerate ground state . in real systems",
    "however , any secondary , smaller term ( arising from single - ion or exchange anisotropy , further neighbor interactions , dipolar interactions , small lattice distortions or a magnetic field , for example ) in the system s hamiltonian can favor certain magnetic ground states at very low temperatures , thereby ( partially ) lifting this peculiar degeneracy . in",
    "this fact lies the origin of the vast richness and diversity of the low temperature magnetic behavior of different frustrated systems in nature@xcite .",
    "geometries suitable to exhibit frustration typically consist of infinite networks of triangles or tetrahedra , which share one or more lattice sites .",
    "one of the most common structures known to be able to induce magnetic frustration is that of the pyrochlores , a@xmath4b@xmath4o@xmath5 , where both the a@xmath2 ions ( rare earth element , coordinated to 8 o atoms ) and the b@xmath6 ions ( transition metal element , coordinated to 6 o atoms ) reside on a lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedra , known as the pyrochlore lattice . thus , if either a@xmath2 or b@xmath6 is a magnetic species , frustration may occur due to competing interactions .",
    "a subclass of the pyrochlores is formed by the rare earth titanate family , r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , where the r@xmath2 ion is the only ( para-)magnetic species , since ti@xmath6 is diamagnetic ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "for the pyrochlore lattice , both theory@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite predict a collective paramagnetic ground state , or the lack of long range magnetic ordering , for classical heisenberg spins at finite temperature .",
    "the quantum heisenberg spin ( s = 1/2 ) model for the pyrochlore lattice also predicts a quantum disordered system at finite temperatures , a state often referred to as a spin liquid@xcite .",
    "however , in reality the different perturbative terms in the corresponding hamiltonian result in quite diverse low temperature magnetic behavior among the different rare earth titanates@xcite , of which the gd , tb , ho and dy variants are studied here .",
    "the supposedly least complex case is that of gadolinium titanate , gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the gd@xmath2 ion has , in contrast to the tb@xmath2 , ho@xmath2 and dy@xmath2 ions , a spin only @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) ground state , rendering the influence of crystal field levels and possible induced ising - like anisotropy insignificant in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the experimentally determined curie - weiss temperature of gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  is @xmath10 k@xcite , indicating antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "thus , gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  could be considered as an ideal realization of the frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet with dipolar interactions .",
    "experimentally , gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  has been found to undergo a magnetic ordering transition at @xmath11 1 k@xcite .",
    "however , this transition corresponds to only partial ordering of the magnetic structure , as only 3 spins per tetrahedron order@xcite . in this partially ordered state",
    "the spins residing on the [ 111 ] planes of the crystal ( which can be viewed as kagom planes ) are ordered in a @xmath12 configuration , parallel to the kagom plane , while the spins residing on the interstitial sites remain either statically or dynamically disordered @xcite .",
    "subsequent experimental investigations revealed a second ordering transition at @xmath11 0.7 k , corresponding to the partial ordering of the interstitial disordered spins@xcite which , however , do remain ( partially ) dynamic down to 20mk.@xcite despite of gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  supposedly being well approximated by the heisenberg antiferromagnet with dipolar interactions , theoretical justification for this complex magnetic behavior remains difficult@xcite .    in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "the dominant interactions are antiferromagnetic , as indicated by the experimentally determined curie - weiss temperature , @xmath13 @xmath14 k@xcite .",
    "a study of the diluted compound ( tb@xmath15y@xmath16)@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 revealed that the contribution to @xmath13 due to exchange and dipolar interactions is @xmath17 k , comparable to the @xmath13-value found in gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite . despite the energy scale of these interactions , the tb@xmath2 moments do not show long range magnetic order down to as low as 50 mk , making it the system closest to a real 3d _ spin liquid _ to date@xcite .",
    "however , crystal field ( cf ) calculations indicate a ground state doublet and ising - like easy axis anisotropy for the ( @xmath18 ) tb@xmath2 magnetic moments along their local @xmath19 directions ( the direction towards the center of the tetrahedron the particular atom is in ) , which would dramatically reduce the degree of frustration in the system@xcite .",
    "theoretical models taking this anisotropy into account predict magnetic ordering temperatures of about 1 k@xcite .",
    "subsequent theoretical work suggests that the magnetic moment anisotropy is more isotropic than ising - like , which could suppress magnetic ordering@xcite .",
    "recently , tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  was argued to be in a quantum mechanically fluctuating spin ice state@xcite .",
    "virtual quantum mechanical cf excitations ( the first excited cf doublet is separated by only @xmath20 @xmath3 from the ground state doublet@xcite ) are proposed to rescale the effective theoretical model from the unfrustrated ising antiferromagnet to a frustrated _ resonating spin ice _ model . nevertheless , the experimentally observed lack of magnetic ordering down to the millikelvin range and the true magnetic ground state in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  remain as of yet enigmatic@xcite .",
    "illustrating the diversity in magnetic behavior due to the subtle differences in the rare earth species of the titanates , the situation in both dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite is again different .",
    "the r@xmath2 ions in these compounds have a @xmath21 ( dy@xmath2 ) and a @xmath22 ( ho@xmath2 ) ground state , respectively , with corresponding free ion magnetic moments @xmath23 ( dy@xmath2 ) and @xmath24(ho@xmath2 ) .",
    "these systems were first thought to have weak ferromagnetic nearest neighbor exchange interactions , as indicated by the small positive values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 k and @xmath27 k for dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , respectively @xcite .",

    "the resulting model is analogous to pauling s ice model@xcite , which earned both dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  and ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1the title of spin ice compound@xcite .",
    "although numerical simulations predict long range order at low temperatures for this model@xcite , experimental studies report no transition to a long range ordered state for either dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite or ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite , down to as low as 50 mk .",
    "as is apparent from above considerations , the low temperature magnetic behavior of the rare earth titanates is dictated by the smallest of details in the structure and interactions of the material .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive experimental study of the structural , crystal field and magnetic properties of these systems may serve to clarify unanswered questions in their understanding . in this paper ,",
    "dc magnetic susceptibility measurements , polarized raman scattering experiments and terahertz time domain spectroscopy on aforementioned members of the rare earth titanates family are employed to gain more insight into the details that drive them towards such diverse behavior .",
    "raman scattering allows for simultaneous investigation of structural and crystal field ( cf ) properties through the observation of both phononic and cf excitations , while the comparison between the various members helps identify the nature of the different excitations observed .",
    "polycrystalline samples of r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  ( where r = gd , tb , dy , ho ) were synthesized by firing stoichiometric amounts of high purity ( @xmath30 ) tio@xmath4 and the appropriate rare earth oxide ( gd@xmath4o@xmath31 , tb@xmath32o@xmath5 , dy@xmath4o@xmath31 or ho@xmath4o@xmath31 , respectively ) , in air , for several days with intermittent grindings .",

    "f@xmath63 _ modes at @xmath11 210 @xmath3 and @xmath11 309 @xmath3 .",
    "fitting with those two peaks only , however , does not adequately reproduce the experimental spectral shape in the the 200 - 300 @xmath3 window .",
    "additionally , as the temperature is lowered , the phonon modes sharpen and the existence of this excitation becomes obvious in the spectra .",
    "worth noting are also the two anomalous modes in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  at @xmath11 303 ( _ f@xmath63 _ ) and @xmath11 313 @xmath3 ( _ e@xmath62 _ ) , which have lower frequencies and wider lineshapes compared to their counterparts in the other , isostructural rare earth titanates .",
    "next to the expected raman active vibrations , the spectra in this work show some very weak scattering intensity at low wavenumbers ( first two rows in table [ assignments ] ) , which has been reported before@xcite .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite were unable to account for this intensity in their calculations , while mori _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite offer the plausible assignment to trace r@xmath4o@xmath31 in the system .",
    "the latter assignment is also tentatively adopted here .",
    "et al . _ also suggested the missing @xmath59 mode may be responsible for some of this low wavenumber intensity .",
    "additionally , a weak mode is observed at 450 @xmath3 in most r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  compounds , as was also seen before .",
    "zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite and hess _ _ et al.__@xcite ascribed the missing @xmath59 mode to this feature . alternatively ,",
    "_ et al.__@xcite interpreted it as being due to trace amounts of starting compound tio@xmath4 , which is known@xcite to have a phonon at 447 @xmath3 .",
    "the true origin of this mode is at present unclear .",
    "finally , there is some low intensity scattering intensity at higher wavenumbers , around 700 @xmath3 ( last two rows of table [ assignments ] ) .",
    "this intensity has been observed before@xcite and is ascribed to forbidden ir modes made active by slight , local non - stoichiometry in the system.@xcite          raman spectra of the r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  crystals were recorded at temperatures ranging from rt to 4 k. figure [ tdependence ] depicts the evolution of both the parallel ( _ @xmath36 _ ) and perpendicular ( @xmath37 ) polarization raman spectra of the r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  crystals with decreasing temperature .",
    "going down in temperature several spectral changes occur in the raman spectra .",
    "the evolution of the phononic excitations with temperature are very similar in the different r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  lattices .",
    "again , this is not surprising , since only oxygen atoms are displaced in the raman active phonons@xcite .",
    "firstly , the lowest frequency phonon ( @xmath59 , @xmath67 @xmath11 210 @xmath3 at rt ) shows a strong softening ( @xmath68 170 @xmath3 at 4 k ) and sharpening with decreasing temperature , revealing the previously unresolved @xmath59 mode ( @xmath69 @xmath11 260 @xmath3 ) , which also softens ( @xmath70 @xmath11 190 @xmath3 ) , but does nt show a strong narrowing . secondly , the sharpening of both the @xmath11 309 @xmath3 _ f@xmath63 _ and the @xmath11 324 @xmath3 _",
    "e@xmath62 _ mode decreases their spectral overlap , clearly justifying the two - mode interpretation of the @xmath11 315 @xmath3 band at rt .",
    "additionally , both modes show a slight softening upon cooldown . also the a@xmath61 phonon ( @xmath69 @xmath11 519 @xmath3 )",
    "shows the familiar softening ( @xmath70 @xmath11 511 @xmath3 ) and sharpening trend on cooling . finally , due to its large width and low intensity , describing the temperature evolution of the highest frequency _ f@xmath63 _",
    "phonon proves rather difficult , though it seems to soften slightly .",
    "comparison of the r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  spectra in fig .",
    "[ tdependence ] yields the observation that the anomalous phonons ( at @xmath11 303 ( _ f@xmath63 _ ) and @xmath11 313 @xmath3 ( _ e@xmath62 _ ) ) in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  remain wide throughout the temperature range , in contrast to the corresponding modes in the other titanates .",
    "additionally , these modes are shifting in opposite directions in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  only : the _ f@xmath63 _ mode softens ( @xmath70 @xmath11 295 @xmath3 ) while the _ e@xmath62 _ mode considerably hardens ( @xmath70 @xmath11 335 @xmath3 ) .",
    "an explanation for this anomalous behavior could be coupling of these phonons to low frequency crystal field excitations of the tb@xmath2-ions ( vide infra ) .      aside from the phonons in the raman spectra of r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , several spectra",
    "also show crystal field ( cf ) excitations of the r@xmath2 ions at low temperatures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lowtemp ] .",
    "the cf level splitting in the different rare earth ions depends on their electronic configuration and their local surroundings . in the r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  family ,",
    "the simplest case is that of the gd@xmath2 ion ( 4@xmath71 ) , which has a spin only @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) ground state , resulting in the absence of a level splitting due to the local crystal field .",
    "consequently , the raman spectrum of gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  shows no cf excitations , making it a suitable template of the r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  raman spectrum with lattice excitations only .",
    "combined with the strong correspondence of the phononic excitations in the r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  spectra , it allows for quick identification of cf modes in the other compounds .",
    "more complicated is the cf level splitting in the tb@xmath2 ion ( 4@xmath72 ) , which has a @xmath18 ground state .",
    "several studies calculating the crystal field for the tb@xmath2-ion in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite , based on inelastic neutron scattering results@xcite , yielded slightly differing energy level schemes for the lowest crystal field levels of tb@xmath2 in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 as is schematically depicted in fig . [ levelscheme ] . here , solid lines depict cf levels observed experimentally , while dotted lines indicate cf levels obtained through cf calculations . shown in fig .",
    "[ tb_zoom ] , which is a zoom - in on the low - wavenumber region of the 4 k perpendicular polarization spectrum of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , are the cf excitations that are observed using inelastic light scattering .",
    "as is also clear from fig .",
    "[ levelscheme ] , all cf excitations previously observed using inelastic neutron scattering are also observed here .",
    "furthermore , additional low - lying excitations can be seen , which are easily identified as cf levels , by comparison with the lattice - only template spectrum of gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the excitations from the crystal field ground state to the higher crystal field levels , of approximate calculated values 13 , 60 , 83 and 118 @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ levelscheme ] ) , are all observed at very similar frequencies , at 12.9 , 60.8 , 83.1 and 119.2 @xmath3 , respectively . the 60.8 @xmath3 level has not been observed experimentally before , though it did follow from the cf calculation made by gingras _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "conversely , the @xmath11 135.2 @xmath3 mode has been observed through inelastic neutron scattering , yet has not been accounted for in cf calculations .",
    "although gardner _ _ et al.__@xcite interpreted it as an optical phonon , this excitation is clearly identified as a cf excitation here , through the isostructural comparison with the other titanates .",
    "the latter assignment is also made by mirebeau _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "additionally , new cf excitations are observed at 7.7 and 47.2 @xmath3 .",
    "while the former is recognized as a cf excitation from the cf ground state to a new cf energy level , the 47.2 @xmath3 could also be interpreted as an excitation from the excited cf level at 12.9 @xmath3 to the higher excited cf level at 60.8 @xmath3 .",
    "while such an excitation is raman active ( see below ) , its occurrence at 4 k seems unlikely , since at this temperature the excited cf level ( 12.9 @xmath3 @xmath11 19 k ) is not expected to be populated enough to give rise to a measurable raman signal .",
    "additionally , were it an excitation from an excited state , its intensity would decrease upon cooling . instead , the intensity of this mode steadily increases with decreasing temperature .    using @xmath58 and @xmath58 , @xmath73 and @xmath57",
    "irreducible representations@xcite for the ground state and excited cf levels , respectively , it can be confirmed that indeed all these ground state to excited state transitions are expected to be raman active . through analogous considerations , the lowest excitation ( @xmath58 @xmath74 @xmath58 , 13 @xmath3 )",
    "is found to be symmetry forbidden in a direct dipole transition . in this respect ,",
    "terahertz time domain spectroscopy ( thz tds ) in the range of 10 to 50 @xmath3 ( 0.3 to 1.5 thz ) was employed to probe the absorption of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  at various temperatures . using this technique it is possible to extract complex optical quantities in the thz range through the direct measurement of the time trace of the transmitted thz pulse .",
    "the obtained curves for the real ( @xmath75 ) and imaginary ( @xmath76 ) parts of the dielectric constant at various temperatures are plotted in fig .",
    "the plots clearly show an absorption around 0.45 thz ( 15 @xmath3 ) at low temperatures , corresponding to the 13 @xmath3 cf level also observed in the raman spectra of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this is corroborated by the identical temperature dependence of the mode in both methods : its spectral signature decreases with increasing temperature , vanishing around 90 k. the fact that the 13 @xmath3 cf level is observed in a direct dipole transition indicates that this level is not a true @xmath58 @xmath74 @xmath58 transition , since such a dipole transition would be symmetry forbidden .",
    "overall , the existence of the additional cf levels in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 unaccounted for by cf calculations , suggests the presence of a second tb@xmath2 site in the structure , with an energy level scheme different from those reported previously .",
    "three additional cf levels are observed experimentally , while four would naively be expected for a slightly differing tb site in this low wavenumber region .",
    "a fourth new cf level might be unresolved due to the strong cf level at 83 @xmath3 or might simply be symmetry forbidden in a raman transition . moreover , the fact that the @xmath66 13 @xmath3 cf level is simultaneously raman and dipole active indicates the breaking of inversion symmetry in the system , which questions the validity of its current symmetry interpretation .",
    "recently , the exact symmetry of the tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  lattice has been extensively studied .",
    "han _ _ et al.__@xcite performed neutron powder diffraction and x - ray absorption fine - structure experiments down to 4.5 k , revealing a perfect pyrochlore lattice , within experimental error .",
    "ofer _ _ et al.__@xcite find no static lattice distortions on the timescale of 0.1 @xmath33s , down to 70 mk .",
    "most recently , however , ruff _ _ et al.__@xcite found finite structural correlations at temperatures below 20 k , indicative of fluctuations above a very low temperature structural transition .",
    "the present experimental results suggest these fluctuations may even induce a minute static disorder , resulting in the observed cf level diagram .",
    "in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  the dy@xmath2 ions ( 4@xmath77 ) have a @xmath21 ground state .",
    "crystal field calculations have been performed by jana _ _ et al.__@xcite , who deduced an energy level scheme consisting of eight kramers doublets , with a separation of @xmath11 100 @xmath3 of the first excited state .",
    "malkin _ _ et al.__@xcite and rosenkranz _ _ et al.__@xcite estimated the first excited state gap to be @xmath78 200 @xmath3 and @xmath11 266 @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the raman spectrum of dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  shows only one extra excitation compared to the lattice template spectrum of gd@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , at an energy of @xmath79 @xmath3 .",
    "this excitation is tentatively ascribed to the first excited cf level , comparing most favorably to the estimation of rosenkranz _",
    "et al._.    for ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , ground state @xmath22 ( ho@xmath2,4@xmath80 ) , several cf energy level schemes have been calculated@xcite , all with first excited state separations around 150 @xmath3 . however , the raman spectrum of ho@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  does not show any clear inelastic light scattering from cf levels to compare these calculations to .",
    "although there is some weak intensity around @xmath11 150 @xmath3 , which compares favorably with all of the calculated level schemes , the intensity of this scattering is insufficient to definitively ascribe it to a cf level .",
    "to summarize , several members of the rare earth titanates family r@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1were studied using magnetic susceptibility measurements and polarized inelastic light scattering experiments .",
    "lattice excitations were found to vary only slightly between crystals with different rare earth ions .",
    "temperature dependent measurements also revealed completely analogous behavior of the phononic excitations , except for two anomalous phonons in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , which seem to be coupled to the low energy crystal field excitations in that compound .",
    "such crystal field excitations were observed in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  and possibly also in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "only one non - phononic excitation is clearly observed in dy@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , its energy consistent with estimates of the first excited crystal field level . for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "all of the the previously determined crystal field energy levels were confirmed .",
    "moreover , the resulting energy level diagram was expanded by three newly observed cf levels , only one of which has been calculated before .",
    "also , one previously reported level was found to be both raman and dipole active , contradicting its current presumed symmetry .",
    "these findings may reflect the existence of two inequivalent tb sites in the low temperature structure or a static symmetry reduction of another nature , suggesting the recently found structural correlations to induce a minute static disorder in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  at very low temperatures . the new crystal field information may serve to help elucidate the complex theoretical enigma of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
