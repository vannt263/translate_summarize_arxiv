    "give rise to such excitations on the surface of strong @xmath7 and crystalline topological insulators.@xcite recently , weyl semimetals , described by three - dimensional massless dirac equation , have also been realized in various noncentrosymmetric materials , such as @xmath10,@xcite @xmath11.@xcite in contrast to the conventional fermi liquids , where low energy excitations live around a closed surface ( fermi surface ) , in all these systems the long - lived quasiparticles can only be found in the vicinity of few special points in the brillouin zone , where the valence and the conduction bands touch each other .",
    "these are the so - called dirac points , and the diverse materials containing these dirac points are often classified together as dirac materials .",
    "+ in addition to the fermionic degrees of freedom , smooth lattice deformations or motion of charge - neutralizing ionic background give rise to new excitations in the system , _ phonons _ , which exist in all solid state systems as fundamental excitations of the lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "phonon modes can also arise on the surface of topological insulators from its slowly varying deformations.@xcite mutual couplings of these two degrees of freedom , the electron - phonon interactions , can lead to interesting many - body phenomena such as superconductivity.@xcite phonon driven pairing can also occur for chiral fermions , living on the surface of topological insulators , where the chemical potential naturally resides inside the conduction band , and in turn supports a finite fermi surface.@xcite even though electron - phonon interactions can lead to significant renormalization of various single - particle quantities , such as electronic self - energy , in a seminal work , migdal showed a long time ago that the correction or renormalization of the electron - phonon vertex due to the quantum fluctuations scales as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electronic and ionic masses , respectively.@xcite therefore , the renormalization of the electron - phonon vertex is typically small in fermi liquids , since @xmath15 .",

    "additionally , the higher order vertex corrections , which we neglect here , can also become significant at intermediate coupling@xcite .",
    "hence , in the context of recently emerging two- and three - dimensional dirac materials , a question arises quite naturally : does the electron - phonon vertex renormalization in the quasirelativistic systems vanish or not as @xmath16 ? or , in other words , does the migdal s theorem for the smallness of the electron - phonon vertex renormalization hold for dirac materials .",

    "in fact , expressing the electron - phonon vertex function in terms of a ratio of the characteristic phonon ( sound ) velocity and the electron ( fermi ) velocity is the appropriate theoretical ( as well as physical ) approach , since this result is more general than introducing an unnecessary ionic ( or electronic ) mass into the formalism .",

    "<S> migdal s theorem plays a central role in the physics of electron - phonon interactions in metals and semiconductors , and has been extensively studied theoretically for parabolic band electronic systems in three- , two- , and one - dimensional systems over the last fifty years . in the current work , we theoretically study the relevance of migdal s theorem in graphene and weyl semimetals which are examples of 2d and 3d dirac materials , respectively , with linear and chiral band dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> our work also applies to 2d and 3d topological insulator systems . in fermi liquids , </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization of the electron - phonon vertex scales as the ratio of sound ( @xmath0 ) to fermi ( @xmath1 ) velocity , which is typically a small quantity . in two- and three - dimensional quasirelativistic systems , such as undoped graphene and weyl semimetals , </S>",
    "<S> the one loop electron - phonon vertex renormalization , which also scales as @xmath2 as @xmath3 , is , however , enhanced by an ultraviolet _ logarithmic divergent correction _ , arising from the linear , chiral dirac band dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> such enhancement of the electron - phonon vertex can be significantly softened due to the logarithmic increment of the fermi velocity , arising from the long range coulomb interaction , and therefore , the electron - phonon vertex correction does not have a logarithmic divergence at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the coulomb interaction does not lead to any additional renormalization of the electron - phonon vertex . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , electron - phonon vertex corrections in two- and three - dimensional dirac fermionic systems scale as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bare fermi velocity , and small when @xmath6 . these results , </S>",
    "<S> although explicitly derived for the intrinsic undoped systems , should hold even when the chemical potential is tuned away from the dirac points . </S>"
