    "<S> the sensitivity of semi - hard ( @xmath0 gev ) hadron production to parton energy loss in high energy nuclear collisions is studied via the hijing1.35 model . </S>",
    "<S> we test the model on recent wa98 data on 160 agev @xmath1 up to @xmath2 gev / c and while these data are reproduced , the results depends sensitively on the model of the cronin effect . at ( rhic ) </S>",
    "<S> collider energies ( @xmath3 agev ) , on the other hand , semi - hard hadron production becomes insensitive to the above model and is thus expected to be a cleaner probe of jet quenching signature associated with non - abelian radiative energy loss . </S>",

    "<S> box 49 , budapest , 1525 , hungary + july 3 , 1998 +    preliminary wa98 @xmath1 data  @xcite in the @xmath9 gev range were analyzed recently by wang  @xcite via a parton model . </S>",
    "<S> the leading log approximation ( lla ) parton model  @xcite was shown to reproduce the observed @xmath10 invariant inclusive cross sections simultaneously in @xmath11 , @xmath12  @xcite , and central @xmath13  @xcite in the cern / sps energy range , @xmath14 agev . </S>",
    "<S> what is remarkable about that analysis is the implied absence of quenching of high transverse momenta hadrons that should be observed if partons lose energy in dense matter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 and @xmath13 data clearly reveal the expected cronin enhancement  @xcite of moderate @xmath15 pions , as seen first in @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 data also confirm the need to supplement the lla with non - perturbative intrinsic @xmath18  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath13 data show no sign of jet quenching expected at collider energies  @xcite .    in central heavy ion reactions at the sps </S>",
    "<S> , conservative estimates of the initial energy density suggest that @xmath19 gev/@xmath20 , are reached . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon radiative energy loss of partons in such dense matter is expected to exceed @xmath21 gev / fm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical analysis  @xcite predicts in fact a much larger non - linear energy loss @xmath22 gev / fm@xmath8 if a parton traverses a quark - gluon plasma of thickness @xmath24 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the wa98 data seem to rule out @xmath25 gev / fm , as wang showed in ref .  @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we consider this problem using the nuclear collision event generator , hijing  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that in the lla , pqcd predicts that the single inclusive hadron cross section is given by refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath26 this formula convolutes the elementary pqcd parton - parton cross sections , @xmath27 , with non - perturbative lowest order fits of the parton structure functions , @xmath28 , and the parton fragmentation functions , @xmath29 , to @xmath30 and @xmath31 data . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 are the intrinsic transverse momenta of the colliding partons . </S>",
    "<S> the model includes a @xmath33 factor to simulate next - to leading order corrections  @xcite at a hard scale @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence of the structure and fragmentation functions account for the multiple soft collinear radiative effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , below energies @xmath35 gev , it is well known  @xcite that lla significantly underpredicts the @xmath0 gev cross section , and additional non - perturbative effects must be introduced to bring lla into agreement with data . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , as emphasized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the results are then quite model dependent below collider ( rhic ) energies . as we show below </S>",
    "<S> , the good news is that this model dependence is reduced significantly at collider ( rhic ) energies .    in spite of the inherent ambiguity of the parton model analysis at sps energies , </S>",
    "<S> a successful phenomenological approaches to this problem has been developed via the introduction  @xcite of intrinsic transverse momenta of the colliding partons as in ( [ parton ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> originally , a gaussian form for that distribution with @xmath36 gev@xmath8 was proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . however , in order to reproduce @xmath17 data more accurately and to take into account the cronin effect , the gaussian ansatz was generalized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to include @xmath37 and @xmath38 dependence . with @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> excellent fits  @xcite to the wa98 data could be obtained assuming a factorized gaussian distribution with @xmath40 where @xmath37 is measured here in ( gev / c)@xmath8 . in ( [ kick ] ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 is the average number of inelastic scatterings a nucleon suffers traversing nucleus @xmath38 at impact parameter @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear thickness function , @xmath43 , is normalized as usual to @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([kick ] ) is the main source of the model dependence in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hijing1.35 monte carlo model  @xcite incorporates pqcd jet production together with initial and final state radiation according to the pythia algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it incorporates a variant of the soft string phenomenology similar to the lund / fritiof  @xcite and dpm  @xcite models to simulate beam jet fragmentation and jet hadronization physics . </S>",
    "<S> low transverse momenta inelastic processes are of course highly model dependent , and the parameters must be fit to @xmath17 and @xmath45 data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to apply hijing to the present study because it incorporates in addition to the above soft and hard dynamics , a model of soft ( cronin ) multiple initial state collision effects as well as a simple jet quenching scheme . with these features , we are able to study how competing aspects of the reaction mechanism influence hadronic observables and explore the magnitude of theoretical uncertainties .    in the hijing model , </S>",
    "<S> excited baryon string are assumed to pick up random transfer momentum kicks in each inelastic scattering according to the following distribution @xmath46 where @xmath47 gev / c were chosen to fit low energy ( @xmath48 gev / c ) multiparticle production data in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . a flag , ihpr2(5)(=1 or 0 ) , </S>",
    "<S> makes it possible to compute spectra with and without this effect as shown in part ( a ) of figs.1 - 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the present study is the first test of this model up to @xmath2 gev / c in the sps energy range .    </S>",
    "<S> jet quenching is modeled via gluon splitting according to the number of mean free paths , @xmath49 fm , traversed by a gluon through the cylindrical nuclear reaction volume . in each partonic inelastic interaction </S>",
    "<S> a gluon of energy @xmath50 is assumed to be split off the parent jet and incorporated as a kink in another baryonic string  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( constant ) energy loss per unit length is an input parameter ( hipr1(14 ) in hijing  @xcite ) and can switched on and off via ihpr2(4 ) ( = 1 or 0 ) to test the sensitivity of spectra to jet quenching as shown in figs.1 - 3 .    figure .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figlet1 ] compares 8 the predictions of hijing1.35  @xcite without jet quenching ( @xmath51 ) for the invariant @xmath52 cross section in central nuclear collisions at sps and rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for central @xmath4 collisions are computed integrating over the impact parameters up to @xmath53 chosen to reproduce experimental trigger cross sections . for wa98 @xmath13 and rhic @xmath54 we took @xmath55 fm , while for the wa80 @xmath12 we took @xmath56 fm . </S>",
    "<S> the multiple collision eikonal geometry in hijing is based on standard wood - saxon nuclear densities .    </S>",
    "<S> the parton model fit to the wa98 data are labeled by wang from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the normalization of both the wa98 data and wang s latest calculations ( not shown ) have increased @xmath57 relative to @xcite . ) we note that the hijing1.35 calculation for this interaction given by the solid jagged line also reproduces remarkably well the @xmath10 invariant cross sections without jet quenching . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the lighter @xmath12 reaction , hijing , underestimates the @xmath58 gev / c tail significantly . </S>",
    "<S> this error is traced to the failure of the model to reproduce the @xmath17 high @xmath15 data at these energies , in contrast to its successful account of higher energy data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen by comparing the filled squares to the dot - dashed curves as explained below . therefore , we find that the agreement with the wa98 data is accidental and the observed @xmath38 scaling of the high @xmath15 region at sps energies is not reproduced .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a shows that the soft transverse momentum kick model is the source for the agreement of hijing with the @xmath13 data . </S>",
    "<S> the dot - dashed curves show what happens if the soft @xmath15 kicks modeled with eq.([hjpt ] ) is turned off . </S>",
    "<S> the very strong decrease of the pion yield in the @xmath13 case and the somewhat smaller but still large decrease in the @xmath12 case shows clearly the important role multiple transverse kicks at these energies . </S>",
    "<S> in fact both @xmath12 and @xmath13 dot - dashed curves are found to coincide with the calculated @xmath59 differential cross section scaled by the wounded nucleon factor @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the average number of wounded projectile nucleons and @xmath62 mb for @xmath63 .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the data follow closely the shape of the measured @xmath64 data taken from @xcite and scaled to @xmath65 by multiplying by the glauber binary collision number factor , @xmath66 . from hijing the average number of binary collisions in these systems </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath67 , @xmath68 resp . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the wa98 data scale with the above glauber factor within a factor of three , suggests that the additional @xmath15 broadening due to initial state collisions is relatively small . </S>",
    "<S> the very large @xmath38 dependence of the hijing @xmath15 tail at sps energies is due to the @xmath69 times convolution of the distribution ( [ hjpt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is avoided in the parton model calculation@xcite using ( [ kick ] ) through the separation of larger intrinsic momentum effects and smaller @xmath69 dependent contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the missing intrinsic transverse momentum component of hijing precludes an accurate simultaneous reproduction of of @xmath70 data at sps energies . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike the parton model where no global conservation laws have to be enforced , it is not clear how to incorporate intrinsic momenta in a global event generator like hijing without destroying the satisfactory reproduction of _ low _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 gev / c data . we do not attempt to solve this problem here .    </S>",
    "<S> our main point is that this problem goes away fortunately at higher ( rhic ) collider energies ( @xmath71 agev ) . as seen in fig.1a ) the effect of multiple soft interactions is very much reduced at that energy . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the well known effect that as the beam energy increases , the @xmath15 spectra become harder and additional @xmath15 smearing from initial state effects becomes relatively less important . </S>",
    "<S> it is the extreme steepness of the cross sections at sps energies that amplifies so greatly the sensitivity of the moderate @xmath15 yields to this aspect of multiple collision dynamics .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b , we consider next the sensitivity of the pion yields to the sought after parton energy loss dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the striking difference between figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1a and 1b is that in 1b the sps yield is not sensitive to the energy loss model in hijing , while at rhic energies the suppression of semi - hard hadrons is seen to be sensitive to jet quenching as predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this seems counter intuitive at first because the increasing steepness with decreasing beam energy is naively expected to result in greater quenching for a fixed jet energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this model the observed @xmath15 range is dominated by multiple soft collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the moderate @xmath72 gev quarks , which fragment into the observed pions , are not produced in rare pqcd semi - hard interactions but are gently nudged several times into that @xmath15 range . since in hijing jet - quenching is restricted to only those partons that suffer a semi - hard pqcd interaction with @xmath15 at least @xmath73 gev / c ( the mini - jet scale ) , no quenching arises at this energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the above conclusions are further clarified in figs . 2 and 3 , where the effects of @xmath15 kicks and jet quenching are shown for valence quarks and diquarks and gluons prior to hadronization . </S>",
    "<S> in figure 2a , the valence quark plus diquark distribution , @xmath74 , is seen to be enhanced by two orders of magnitude due to the assumed cronin mechanism at sps energies whereas they are enhanced only by @xmath75 at rhic energies . in fig.2b , on the other hand , quark jets are seen to be suppressed by an order of magnitude at rhic energies , while at sps energies no quenching arises because only about @xmath76% of the 5 gev / c quarks are produced directly by hard pqcd processes .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a shows that the ( negligible ) gluon component of partons undergoing hard processes at sps energies are in fact quenched by an order of magnitude just as at rhic energies , but because they represent such a small fraction of the produced partons , their effect on the final hadron observables is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> note the three order of magnitude rise of the mini - jet gluon component going from sps to rhic energies in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b . in that figure , </S>",
    "<S> the minimum momentum @xmath73 gev / c assumed for jet quenching is seen by the rapid drop of the gluon spectra beyond @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the ratio of valence quarks to gluons after quenching at rhic energies remains @xmath78 for mini - jets up to @xmath79 gev / c .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we found that hijing1.35 fits the wa98 data with or without jet quenching . </S>",
    "<S> however , this model fails to account for the weak @xmath38 dependence of the data that scale approximately with the glauber @xmath80 factor , and therefore the fit must be viewed as accidental . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the current wa98 data can also be reproduced by entirely soft physics models utilizing hydrodynamic equations  @xcite , which unfortunately make no prediction for the a dependence . on the other hand , another monte carlo parton cascade model  @xcite overpredicted the @xmath10 cross section at @xmath2 gev / c by a factor of 100 </S>",
    "<S> ! those results do not prove the validity of hydrodynamics nor the absence of parton cascading , but emphasize the strong model dependence of the sps spectra due to non - perturbative aspects of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> those aspects , while phenomenologically interesting , make it difficult to identify perturbative qcd phenomena and search for jet quenching .    </S>",
    "<S> the main point of this work , is not to improve the hijing soft @xmath15 phenomenology , but to emphasize the good news that at collider energies there is much less sensitivity to the above uncertain element of the reaction mechanism . at @xmath81 agev the expected  @xcite jet quenching signature should be readily observable in the @xmath79 gev range . </S>",
    "<S> such experiments will commence in 1999 at rhic and should provide important tests of the theory of non - abelian multiple collisions and energy loss  @xcite . </S>"
