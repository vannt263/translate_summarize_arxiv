    "machine type communication ( mtc ) is envisaged to play a key role within future fifth generation networks  @xcite . with mtc , devices ( i.e. , smart meters , sensor nodes , appliances , etc . )",
    "can automatically  talk \" to each other without the human intervention , which will undoubtedly create unprecedented applications and new business models .",
    "while mtc brings great opportunities , it also poses significant challenges because of the distinct system requirements . depending on the two major challenges",
    ", mtc can be classified into two types : _ massive machine type communication _ ( mmtc ) and _ ultra - reliable machine type communication _ ( umtc )  @xcite .",
    "mmtc is expected to provide massive access to a large number of often low - complexity and low - power machine type devices ( mtds ) .",
    "umtc is expected to provide the network services for those mtds with critical requirements in terms of latency and reliability . in this work ,",
    "we will focus on the mmtc .    for mmtc , one way to handle a massive number of simultaneous device connections",
    "is to enhance the operation of random access channel of long term evolution and long term evolution advanced such that congestion and overloading can be reduced  @xcite .",
    "different methods have been proposed to offer more efficient access in the literature , such as the access class barring  @xcite , prioritized random access  @xcite and backoff adjustment scheme  @xcite .",
    "another promising way to deal with the massive connection problem is the concept of data aggregation  @xcite . with the data aggregator , instead of the direct communication between mtds and the core network ( i.e. , base station in cellular network ) , the traffic from mtds",
    "is first transmitted to the designated data aggregator and the aggregator then relays the collected packets to the core network .",
    "such an aggregation structure reduces the number of connections to the core networks thereby reducing congestion  @xcite . it also reduces the power consumption at the mtd side , since transmission link for mtd is greatly shortened  @xcite .    recently ,",
    "some papers have considered data aggregation in mmtc .",
    "for example , the mtd clustering problem was analyzed in both  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite utilized the joint massive access control , while resource allocation to perform mtd grouping and an energy - efficiency cluster - head selection scheme was developed in  @xcite to maximize the network life .",
    "the joint - user decoding was studied in  @xcite and a closed - form expression of the maximum zero - outage downlink rate was derived when multiple mtds are attached to a cellular user . by employing the trunked radio system ,",
    "the authors in  @xcite investigated the basic trade - off between latency and transmit power for delivering the aggregated traffic .",
    "these works , however , considered either a single aggregator or a single base station ( bs ) scenario and ignored the coverage nature of wireless transmission .    in a large scale cellular network with multiple aggregators and multiple bss , interference exists and can affect the machine type communication when multiple aggregators ( or bss ) share the same resource",
    ". there are only a few papers characterizing the interference in mmtc with data aggregation . in  @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) for sensor nodes was derived and this work only focused on the single - hop scenario where the data from sensor nodes was aggregated at the data collectors . a clustering geometry model for mtd locations",
    "was introduced in  @xcite , where a two - hop clustering method based on slotted aloha was proposed and the analysis was based on simulations .",
    "the authors in  @xcite analyzed the sir coverage , rate coverage and energy consumption for a large - scale hierarchical wireless network with mmtc .",
    "note that each device in  @xcite was assumed to be guaranteed with an equal resource .",
    "however , when the spectrum resources are limited , it may be necessary to implement resource scheduling  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as envisioned in  @xcite , the aggregator in mmtc should not be restricted to act as a simple relay and more intelligence at the aggregator ( e.g. , resource scheduling , spectrum sharing and so on ) should help to improve the network efficiency .",
    "very recently , some papers have investigated the data aggregation for mmtc in the context of resource scheduling .",
    "specifically , a resource allocation approach based on the consideration of the useful information content for individual mtds was developed in  @xcite . by exploiting queueing - dynamics ,",
    "a periodic scheduling algorithm was proposed in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors solved a resource sharing problem using a novel interference - aware bipartite graph .",
    "a low complexity optimal packet scheduler was developed in  @xcite using an iterative process .",
    "again , these works considered a single core network and most of them did not take interference into account .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to characterize the interference and coverage performance for the mmtc with data aggregation in a large - scale cellular network system , where the resource scheduling scheme is implemented at the aggregator side .",
    "we leverage stochastic geometry , as a powerful math tools , to provide tractable analytical results  @xcite .",
    "we make the following major contributions in this paper :    * we introduce a tractable two - phase network model for massive machine type communication , where mtds first transmit to their serving aggregators ( aggregation phase ) and then the aggregated data is delivered to bss ( relaying phase ) .",
    "we develop a general analytical framework to investigate the signal - to - interference ratio for both transmission phases .",
    "based on this , we obtain the approximated yet accurate results for the mtd success probability , average number of successful mtds and probability of successful channel utilization , which are key metrics to evaluate the overall mmtc performance . compared to time consuming monte - carlo simulations ,",
    "our derived analytical expressions allow for fast computation . * by taking into account the limited resources , we include two resource scheduling schemes implemented at the aggregators in the system : i ) random resource scheduling ( rrs ) scheme , where aggregators randomly allocate the limited resources to mtds ; and ii ) channel - aware resource scheduling scheme ( crs ) scheme , where aggregators allocate resources to the mtds having better channel conditions .",
    "the implementation of crs is generally more complex than the rrs since it requires the perfect channel state information .",
    "our results show that , even though the crs scheme has much better sir performance than the rrs scheme at the aggregation phase , when the resources at the aggregation phase are very limited , the rrs scheme only performs slightly worse than the crs scheme in terms of the overall performance . * based on our derived results , we present different trade - offs in the system and investigate the effect of system parameters on the mmtc performance .",
    "our results show that the provision of more resources at the aggregation phase is not always beneficial to the mmtc performance and sometimes it can even degrade the mtd success probability and average number of successful mtds such as when the resources for the relaying phase are restricted , or the path - loss exponent is small , or the aggregators are very dense .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : system ] presents the detailed system model and assumptions .",
    "the considered performance metrics and their descriptions are presented in section  [ sec : metric ] .",
    "the analysis for the aggregation phase and relaying phase is presented in section  [ sec : firstphase ] and section  [ sec : secondphase ] , respectively .",
    "the analytical results for the metrics are summarized in section  [ sec : summary : metric ] .",
    "numerical and simulation results to study the machine type communication are discussed in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider a single - tier cellular network where the location of base stations is modeled as a homogeneous poisson point process ( hppp ) , denoted as @xmath0 , with density @xmath1 in @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the cellular network is overlaid with data aggregators , which are also spatially distributed according to an independent hppp , denoted as @xmath3 , with density @xmath4 .",
    "each aggregator is assumed to have a serving zone that is a disk region centered at the aggregator with radius @xmath5 . inside each serving zone",
    ", there are multiple machine type devices located around the aggregator .",
    "generally , mtds are either static or low mobility . however , since the frequency of data transmission for each mtd is low , we assume that the location of mtds requiring data transmission is modeled as a matrn cluster point process and the multiple aggregators constitute the parent point process of this matrn cluster point process . in this way",
    ", for each cluster formed by the aggregator , the location of its serving mtds follows a ppp , where each mtd is uniformly and independently distributed with the distance distribution between a mtd and its serving aggregator being @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the average number of mtds in each aggregator s serving zone .",
    "the density of mtds is then given by @xmath8  @xcite , and the instantaneous number of mtds in each aggregator , denoted as @xmath9 , follows the poisson distribution with mean @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "[ fig_network ] illustrates a snapshot of the considered network model .",
    "we consider the uplink transmission model for machine type communication and the data transmission for a mtd can be divided into two phases . in the first phase ( called the aggregation phase ) , the mtd tries to transmit its data with a fixed payload size @xmath11 to its serving aggregator .",
    "note that in our work the aggregator not only works as a relay , but can also implement the resource scheduling .",
    "we assume that , due to the spectrum limitation , there are @xmath12 orthogonal channels available that are scheduled for data transmission from mtds to aggregators , and this channel set is denoted as @xmath13 .",
    "the limited channel resources @xmath13 will be used among all aggregators across the entire network . since at most one mtd",
    "is allowed to occupy one orthogonal channel within an aggregator s serving zone , there is only inter - cluster interference ( i.e. , the interference from mtds in the serving zones of other aggregator ) and no intra - cluster interference ( i.e. , the interference from mtds within the serving zone of the same aggregator ) exists . in this work , we consider a random resource scheduling scheme ( rrs ) , where any channel belonging to @xmath13 will be independently and randomly allocated to any associated mtd with the same probability by the aggregator .",
    "this scheme is suitable for the scenario where the aggregator does not have the channel state information of each mtd . as a benchmark , a channel - aware resource scheduling scheme ( crs )",
    "is also considered . under this scheme ,",
    "the mtds with better fading ( equivalently , better signal - to - noise ratio ) will be preferentially assigned with the available channel resources  @xcite , which works for the scenario when the aggregator has the perfect channel state information for mtds .    after aggregating data from the mtds ,",
    "each aggregator transmits the information to its closest bs in the second phase ( called the relaying phase ) . in this way",
    ", the aggregators are partitioned by the voronoi cell formed by the bss , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_network ] .",
    "hence , the distance distribution between an aggregator and its associated bs is given by @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "we further assume that the aggregator s density is far greater than the density of bss such that each bs has at least one aggregator associated to it .",
    "for the multiple aggregators covered by the same bs , they access the bs using a round - robin fashion ( i.e. , the total available uplink resources are equally partitioned among these associated aggregators )  @xcite .",
    "the path - loss plus block fading channel model is employed in this work .",
    "the instantaneous received power at the receiver side is mathematically given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the transmit power from a transmitter , @xmath17 denotes the fading power gain on the transmission link , @xmath18 is the distance between the receiver and transmitter and @xmath19 represents the path - loss exponent ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) . throughout this work ,",
    "we denote the fading experienced at the desired link for the aggregation and relaying phases as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are assumed to be the independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) nakagami-@xmath23 fading with integer @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the fading on the interfering link , which is assumed to be the i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh fading .",
    "all the mtds and aggregators are assumed to use full inversion power control with receiver sensitivity @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "for example , for a given mtd which is a distance @xmath27 away from its serving aggregator , its transmit power will be @xmath28 .",
    "as we are considering an interference - limited scenario , the value of @xmath26 does not impact the performance of the network . without loss of generality , we set @xmath26 to be unity in this work .",
    "using the system model described above , we aim to investigate the network performance in terms of three metrics , namely the mtd success probability , average number of successful mtds and probability of successful channel utilization .",
    "their definitions , along with their mathematical formulations are described in this section below .",
    "this metric is the probability that the data sent by a mtd can be successfully received at the bs side after going through the aggregator . in order to guarantee that a typical mtd s transmission is successful",
    ", the following three conditions must be met :    * _ condition 1 : the typical mtd is not dropped by its serving aggregator .",
    "_ since the number of channels is limited for the aggregation phase , the mtd may not be assigned a channel such that its data is dropped . * _ condition 2 : given that the typical mtd is not dropped , it does not experience channel outage .",
    "_ due to the possible concurrent transmission of mtds in other aggregators serving zone on the same channel , the typical mtd will receive their generated inter - cluster interference . to ensure that the data can be successfully decoded at the aggregator",
    ", the signal - to - interference ratio at the aggregator ( denoted as @xmath29 ) has to be greater than a certain threshold @xmath30 . otherwise , this typical mtd is in channel outage . *",
    "_ condition 3 : the serving aggregator is not in channel outage .",
    "_ similarly , when the aggregator transmits packet to its associated bs , it will receive the inter - cell interference from other aggregators .",
    "the sir at the bs ( denoted as @xmath31 ) has to be higher than a threshold @xmath32 .",
    "the mtd success probability can thus be generally written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the expectation operator and @xmath35 is the indicator function .",
    "the aggregation and relaying phases are dependent . for analytical tractability",
    ", we assume that each phase is independent  @xcite and the accuracy of this assumption will be verified in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "thus , we decouple each factor in   and rewrite the mtd success probability as is slightly different from  , because the first and second conditions are correlated . its exact expression will be shown in section  [ sec : summary : metric ] . ]",

    "this metric evaluates , for a typical aggregator , the average number of its serving mtds whose data can be successfully received by the bs .",
    "it relies on two factors : i ) the number of serving mtds whose data can be successfully decoded by the aggregator at the aggregation phase ( equivalently , the number of active channels , denoted as @xmath40 ) ; and ii ) whether the data aggregated at the aggregator can be successfully decoded by its associated bs",
    ". we can formally write this metric as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the probability mass function ( pmf ) of the number of active channels , and @xmath43 is relaying phase s conditional channel success probability given @xmath44 active channels .",
    "_ _ the mtd success probability is a metric to assess the performance of a single mtd , while the average number of successful mtds is a metric to assess the impact of aggregators .",
    "we have adapted their definitions from  @xcite .",
    "both metrics are dependent , to a certain extent , on the available channel resources . in order to explicitly examine the efficiency of channel utilization , we consider the following metric , which evaluates the performance from the perspective of channel resources .",
    "it is the average probability that a certain channel is occupied by a mtd and this mtd s data can finally be decoded by the bs .",
    "it can be written as @xmath45 @xmath46    similar to the mtd success probability , by assuming the independence between the aggregation and relaying phases , we can have the probability of successful channel utilization as @xmath47 where the average channel occupation probability @xmath48 is the average probability that a channel is occupied by a mtd .    in the following two sections",
    ", we discuss the key elements determining these performance metrics grouped according to the two phases .",
    "in this section , we investigate the channel utilization performance and the channel success probability of the aggregation phase .      different from  @xcite where all the mtds in the network region are assured to be assigned with an equal channel resource , in our work , aggregators can schedule the limited resources to mtds . under the rrs scheme",

    "if @xmath53 , the aggregator will randomly pick @xmath9 channels and allocate these channels to @xmath9 mtds .",

    "[ fig : effectn_channel ] shows that as the number of channels of the aggregation phase increases , the probability of successful channel utilization always decreases , which has also been observed in fig .",
    "[ metric3 ] .",
    "this is because as more channels become available for the aggregation phase , there is lesser chance for a channel to be occupied by a mtd .",
    "consequently , the channel utilization performance is deteriorated .",

    "it shows that , when @xmath103 becomes large , the mtd success probability increases with the increasing number of channels . after a certain value of @xmath12 , the curves are almost flat .",
    "for example , under @xmath108 , by increasing @xmath12 from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , @xmath106 only increases from 0.6997 to 0.7195 while @xmath105 decreases a lot ( i.e. , from 0.6113 to 0.4197 ) .",
    "this manifests that the performance gain achieved by adding more channels is very little and also the channels are greatly underused .",
    "when the available resources for the relaying phase are small ( i.e. , for the curves with @xmath111 or @xmath112 ) , the mtd success probability increases at first and then decreases as @xmath12 increases .",
    "this can be explained as follows . from the average perspective , according to  , the mtd success probability is determined by three factors .",
    "as @xmath12 increases , the average non - drop probability of a mtd @xmath37 increases at first and then stays as 1 .",
    "the channel success probability of the aggregation phase , @xmath38 , almost keeps as a constant at first since each channel is fully occupied .",
    "@xmath38 then begins to increase because the channel occupation probability decreases , which reduces the interference experienced at each channel .",
    "as for the channel success probability of the relaying phase @xmath39 , it is always decreasing .",
    "this is because , as @xmath12 increases , more data is required to be transmitted by data aggregator thereby degrading the channel performance . for the first two factors , they are independent of the available resources of the relaying phase . however",
    ", @xmath39 strongly relies on the relaying phase s resources .",
    "we find that when the available resources of the relaying phase are scarce ( i.e. , @xmath103 is small ) , @xmath39 drops a lot as @xmath12 increases , compared the case where @xmath103 is large .",
    "the interplay of these factors results in the trends as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effectn_node ] .    we have also examined the impact of @xmath12 under different path - loss exponent and different aggregator s density as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effectn_diff ] . from these figures , we observe that when the path - loss exponent is small or the aggregator s density is large , such non - monotonic trend is more likely to occur .",
    "this is because , when @xmath12 gets larger , under these scenarios , the interference experienced at the relaying phase is more severe , which causes @xmath39 to decrease faster .",
    "thus , we see that increasing the number of channels of the aggregation phase does not always benefit to the mmtc , especially for the case when the channel performance of the relaying phase is poor .      in this subsection ,",
    "we analyze the effect of mtds and aggregator s density .",

    "as illustrated in these subfigures , as the aggregator s density ( equivalently , the mtd s density ) increases , both the probability of successful channel utilization and mtd success probability decrease , which implies that the performance for a single mtd , aggregator and channel worsens .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "as indicated in remark 1 , the channel occupation probability and non - drop probability of a mtd keep the same regardless of aggregator s density .",
    "thus , these two metrics only rely on the channel success probability of the aggregation and relaying phases ( i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "when @xmath113 increases , more mtds are brought into the network and more interference will be generated on each channel , which results in decreasing @xmath38 . with respect to @xmath39 ,",
    "it decreases at first and then increases .",
    "initially , because more aggregators will be associated to the same bs , less resources are allocated to each aggregator and @xmath39 decreases .",
    "after a certain point ( i.e. , when the performance for @xmath38 is very poor ) , less mtds can be successfully connected to the aggregator .",
    "hence , @xmath39 begins to increase since the data transmitted by an aggregator is significantly reduced .",
    "note that , when aggregators are very dense , the performance of @xmath38 is so severe such that the overall performance is mainly governed by @xmath38 . consequently , the general trends for @xmath106 ( equivalently , @xmath114 ) and @xmath105 are decreasing .",
    "we also examine the average number of successful mtds per km@xmath100 .",
    "[ fig : effectdenisty_nodeall1 ] plots the aggregator s density versus the average number of successful mtds per km@xmath100 .",

    "general speaking , increasing the aggregator s density first improves the average number of successful mtds per km@xmath100 , since at the low density region the performance is mainly impacted by @xmath113 . when the aggregators are too dense such that increasing @xmath113 can not compensate the loss at each aggregator , the overall performance deteriorates . in summary , properly choosing the aggregator s density can enhance the performance in terms of the average number of successful mtds per km@xmath100 .",
    "in this work , we have proposed a tractable analytical framework to study a two - phase cellular - base mmtc system , where data from mtds is first aggregated at the data aggregator and then relayed to bss .",
    "the aggregators also schedule the limited resources among their serving mtds .",

    "in addition , providing more numbers of channels at the aggregation phase can sometimes degrade overall mmtc performance , especially when the relaying phase experiences severe interference .",
    "the channel occupation probability is independent of the resource scheduling scheme and it only relies on the number of mtds requiring data transmission . given that there are @xmath9 mtds requiring data transmission for a typical aggregator , the available @xmath12 channels will be assigned to @xmath115 mtds and the remaining @xmath116 mtds are dropped . hence , the conditional channel occupation probability is given by @xmath117 .",

    "for an active aggregator that is associated with this typical bs , given the number of active channels for this aggregator @xmath40 and the total number of active aggregators associated with the bs @xmath89 , the conditional channel success probability is given by @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath22 is the fading gain on the desired link from aggregator to the typical bs which follows a gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath25 , @xmath149 is the aggregate interference from active aggregators occupying the same resource  @xcite .",
    "therein , @xmath150 denotes both the location and the interfering aggregators , and @xmath151 is the distance from the interfering aggregator to its associated bs where its pdf is @xmath14 .",
    "as we consider the orthogonal access for each aggregator within each bs , only one aggregator per cell can use the certain resource block and generate the interference to the typical bs . in general , the point process @xmath152 is a poisson - voronoi perturbed lattice  @xcite .",
    "however , the consideration of such a point process leads to intractable results .",
    "hence , similar to  @xcite , we approximate the the location of interfering aggregators as a hppp with density @xmath153 , where @xmath95 is the void probability that accounts for the probability that bs has zero active aggregator  @xcite .    based on the above approximation , the mgf of the interference at the relaying phase is given by @xmath154}{\\alpha-2}\\mathbb{e}_{r_a}\\left\\{r_a^2\\right\\ } \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ = & \\exp\\left(-2(1-p_{\\textrm{void}})s\\frac{\\,_2f_1\\left[1,1-\\frac{2}{\\alpha},2-\\frac{2}{\\alpha},-s\\right]}{\\alpha-2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath155}{\\alpha-2}\\bigg ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\exp\\left(-2(1-p_{\\textrm{void}})s\\frac{\\,_2f_1\\left[1,1-\\frac{2}{\\alpha},2-\\frac{2}{\\alpha},-s\\right]}{\\alpha-2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second step is based on the approximation of @xmath152 being hppp and then followed by the campbell theorem  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath18 is the distance between the interfering active aggregator and the typical bs .",
    "it is in the range of @xmath156 $ ] instead of @xmath157 $ ] due to the aggregator association scheme .",
    "since the active aggregator is always associated to its closest bs , its distance to the bs should be greater than its distance to its associated bs @xmath151 .",
    "if @xmath158 , it violates the association scheme .",
    "the third step comes from the fact that the fading gain on the interfering link follows an exponential distribution .",
    "the fourth step is based on the variable substitution , i.e. , @xmath159 and the last step comes from the fact that @xmath160 .",
    "the next step is to de - condition the above conditional channel success probability . the distribution of @xmath40 is already presented in corollaries  [ coro : distribution1 ] and  [ coro : distribution1p ] for different schemes . in terms of the distribution of @xmath89 ,",
    "there is no exact closed - form expression for this distribution .",
    "however , a simple approximation has been proposed in  @xcite , which can provide sufficient accuracy for practical purposes  @xcite and has been widely adopted in the literature .",
    "the approximation for the distribution of the number of active aggregator associated with a bs is given by @xmath161(\\frac{{\\lambda_{a}}'}{{\\lambda_{b}}})^{n_a}}{\\gamma\\![3.5]\\gamma\\![n_a+1](3.5+\\frac{{\\lambda_{a}}'}{{\\lambda_{b}}})^{n_a+3.5}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after averaging   over @xmath89 and @xmath40 , we can arrive the result presented in proposition  [ theo : channeloutage2 ] .",
    "note that the extra term in denominator @xmath162 comes from the fact the derived average channel success probability is calculated for the link from the active aggregator to bs , which requires @xmath81 and @xmath163 .        c.  bockelmann , n.  pratas , h.  nikopour , k.  au , t.  svensson , c.  stefanovic , p.  popovski , and a.  dekorsy , `` massive machine - type communications in 5 g : physical and mac - layer solutions , '' _ ieee commun . mag .",

    "<S> our numerical results show that , although the crs outperforms the rrs in terms of sir at the aggregation phase , the simpler rrs has almost the same performance as the crs for most cases with regards to the overall mmtc performance . furthermore , the provision of more resources at the aggregation phase is not always beneficial to the mmtc performance .    </S>",
