    "wide range equation of state ( eos ) for hydrogen or its isotopes is of crucial interest for inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) and astrophysics @xcite . in the traditional central - hot - spot ignition designs of icf",
    ", a deuterium - tritium ( d - t ) capsule is assumed to be imploded to high density either directly by high power laser pulses @xcite or indirectly by x rays generated in the hohlraum @xcite . due to the fact that the compressibility of the capsule is determined by eos ,",

    "the giant jovian planets , such as jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune , are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the knowledge on the size and mass distribution of giant jovian planets are sensitive to the eos of hydrogen in a wide range @xcite .",
    "the eos of hydrogen has been probed through gas gun @xcite , converging explosive @xcite , magnetically driven flyer @xcite , and high power laser - driven experiments @xcite , where a pressure - temperature thermodynamical domain with amplitudes of megabar ( mbar ) and electron volt ( ev ) has been reached .",
    "theoretical approximations , such as classical molecular dynamics based on interatomic potentials @xcite , linear mixing method @xcite , fluid variational theory ( fvt ) @xcite , path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) @xcite , and quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite , have already been employed to study high - pressure behaviors of hydrogen and its isotopes .",
    "although it has been pursued over decades , there are still some fundamental issues worth to be noticed .",
    "for instance , the first - order phase transition from molecular to atomic fluid transition is being under intense discussion , and plasma phase transition ( ppt ) characterized by electronic ionization still needs to be clarified @xcite . high precision , wide range eos for hydrogen are of particularly importance for hydrodynamic simulations in icf , especially at densities from @xmath4 to @xmath5 g/@xmath2 and temperatures up to 10@xmath6 k , or even higher .",
    "currently , sesame - eos table @xcite for hydrogen describes chemical species , such as , h@xmath7 molecules , h atoms , and free protons and electrons based on chemical models @xcite , which are only expected to work well in the weak coupling limit .",
    "recently , a new eos table based on pimc simulations has been built , however , pimc results are not consistent with experiments at pressures below 50 gpa along the hugoniot curve @xcite . as a consequence , wide range eos for hydrogen",
    "is highly recommended to be constructed from other promising ways for comparisons and applications .    in the present work , a combined density functional theory ( dft )",
    "method of first - principles molecular dynamics ( fpmd ) and orbital - free molecular dynamics ( ofmd ) has been used to construct wide range eos for fluid hydrogen with a temperature range @xmath8 k and density range @xmath9 g/@xmath2 . in fpmd",
    "the electrons are treated quantum mechanically through finite - temperature dft ( ftdft ) with the only approximation of exchange - correlation functional .",
    "due to the fermi - dirac distribution of the electronic states , at extremely high temperatures a huge number of occupational bands have to be introduced , and fpmd simulations are then restricted . as a consequence ,",
    "ofmd simulations , where the electronic kinetic energy is expressed as a functional of the local electronic density and possibly of its gradient , have been adopted to avoid the limitation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the computational methods with respect to fpmd and ofmd . in section iii",
    ", we discuss the eos in detail , and finally we get our conclusions in section iv .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the basic formalism employed to explore thermodynamic properties of fluid hydrogen .",
    "that is , two basic quantum - mechanical dft approaches , one based on kohn - sham ( ks ) formula and the other based on orbital - free method .",
    "then the simulation parameters are presented in detail .",
    "our fpmd simulations for fluid hydrogen have been performed by using abinit code @xcite . in these simulations ,",
    "the electrons are fully quantum mechanically treated by employing a plane - wave ft - dft description , where the electronic state occupations follow the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the ions move classically according to the forces from the electron density and the ion - ion repulsion .",
    "we employed the nvt ( canonical ) ensemble , where the number of particles @xmath10 and the volume are fixed @xcite .",
    "the system was assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the electron and ion temperatures being equal ( @xmath11 ) . in these calculations ,",
    "the electronic temperature was been kept constant according to the fermi - dirac distribution , while the ionic temperature was controlled by the noe thermostat .    at each step during md simulations ,",
    "a set of electronic state functions @xmath12 for each @xmath13-point were determined within ks construction by @xmath14 with @xmath15 in which the four terms respectively represent the kinetic contribution , the electron - ion interaction , the hartree contribution , and the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the electronic density was obtained by @xmath16 then by applying the velocity verlet algorithm , based on the force from interactions between ions and electrons , a new set of positions and velocities were obtained for ions .",
    "ofmd simulations @xcite , where the kinetic energy of the electrons is treated semiclassically , have also been used to investigate the wide range eos for fluid hydrogen under extreme conditions .",

    "denotes the von werzscker correction . in the present simulations we have omitted this gradient term and worked in a thomas - fermi - dirac form using the formula proposed by perrot @xcite to deal with the kinetic - entropic part .",
    "the orbital - free procedure treats all electrons on an equal footing , albeit approximately , with no distinction between bound and ionized electrons .",
    "except for that , the ofmd simulation procedure is similar to that of fpmd .      using the above - mentioned dft formalisms ( namely , fpmd and ofmd )",
    ", we aim to build a wide range dft - eos table of data points for liquid hydrogen with the density ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 g/@xmath2 and temperature from @xmath5 to @xmath3 k. generally , the coulomb liquids can be characterized by two non - dimensional parameters .",
    "that is , the ionic coupling parameter and electronic degenerate parameter . for liquid hydrogen , the former one is commonly defined as @xmath22 , which presents the ratio of the mean electrostatic potential energy and the mean kinetic energy of the ions .",
    "the degeneracy parameter @xmath23 is the ratio of the temperature to the fermi temperature @xmath24 . within the fpmd formalism",
    ", the electronic states are occupied according to the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "thus , our fpmd simulations have been restricted to temperatures lower than @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) at @xmath27 g/@xmath2 . for lower densities ,",
    "our fpmd simulations have been performed up to a temperature of 15.682 ev . to overcome the computational cost limit ,",
    "ofmd was used in the same simulated conditions ( density and temperature ) as those in fpmd , and explored to extend to higher temperatures .",

    "each curve has been shifted by 1.0 from the previous one for clarity.,height=226 ]    in general , fpmd and ofmd simulations based on dft have introduced pseudopotentials to reduce the computational cost and ensure the accuracy at moderate densities .",
    "however , the pseudo - core approximation fails at high densities , where the interatomic distance is comparable with or smaller than the cutoff radius of the pseudopotential , due to pressure - induced delocalization of the core electrons and the overlapping of the pseudization spheres . in order to avoid the limitations introduced by pseudopotential approximation , a columbic pseudopotential with a cutoff radius of 0.001 a.u .",
    "has been built @xcite . as the energy dependence is better than 1% between projector augmented wave ( paw ) potentials and columbic potential ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_pot ] ) , we explore the eos of hydrogen into high density ( @xmath29 g/@xmath2 ) by using a short cutoff radius columbic potential .",
    "we have considered a total number of 8 @xmath30 512 atoms ( corresponding to expanded and ultra dense regimes ) in a series of volume - fixed supercells , which are repeated periodically throughout the space . only @xmath31 point is used to sample the brillouin zone in molecular dynamic simulations , because the selection of higher number of @xmath13 points modifies the eos within 3% .",
    "each system was assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the electron and ion temperatures being equal ( @xmath32 ) . in order to balance the pseudopotential approximation in the high density regime and the computational cost ,",
    "two potentials have been adopted in both fpmd and ofmd simulations .",
    "that is , the paw ( with @xmath33 a.u . )",
    "pseudopotential ( @xmath34 30 g/@xmath2 ) and short cutoff radius coulombic potential ( @xmath35 20 g/@xmath2 ) , where the plane wave cutoff energy is set to 200 ha , respectively .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional is determined by local density approximation ( lda ) with teter - pade parametrization @xcite , and the temperature dependence of exchange - correlation functional , which is convinced to be as small as negligible , is not taken into account .",
    "n@xmath36 = 6000 has been used in the molecular dynamic simulations , and the time steps are selected with considering different density and temperature @xcite .",
    "the eos are obtained as running average of the last 1000 steps of molecular dynamic simulations .",
    "additionally , in fpmd simulations , sufficient electronic states have been adopted to secure the occupational number below @xmath37 .",
    "a wide range dft - eos ( listed in table i ) has been constructed by data obtained from fpmd ( for @xmath38 ) and ofmd ( @xmath39 ) simulations .",
