    "these formalisms have already been successfully used in the simplest two - reservoir setting @xcite , and in several non - stationary settings which involved a single current .",
    "as we will show here , the presence of multiple absorbing patches , leading to multiple currents , allows one to ask new questions , and brings qualitatively new effects .",
    "one new question concerns the joint probability distribution of , and correlations between , the absorption currents at different receptors .",
    "one qualitatively new effect is vorticity which , as we will see , is typically present in the most probable particle flux field conditioned on a specified joint absorption statistics .",
