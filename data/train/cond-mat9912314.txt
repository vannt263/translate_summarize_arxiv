    "within the pseudogap regime of the cuprates , it has been widely argued that the excitations of the superconducting state are predominantly fermionic@xcite or predominantly bosonic@xcite in character .",
    "we have pointed out@xcite that there is a third scenario which is no less likely and which , at the least , needs to be considered on an equal footing .",
    "this third scenario emerges when one studies the bcs bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover picture for @xmath1 . at weak coupling ( when the coherence length @xmath2 is large ) the excitations are dominantly fermionic , and at very strong coupling ( small @xmath2 ) they are dominantly bosonic . at intermediate coupling , which is likely to be appropriate to the cuprates ,",
    "the excitations are of mixed character . in this paper",
    "we discuss the implications of this third scenario , in the context of semi - quantitative comparisons with experiment , for the superfluid density and specific heat .",
    "there have been a number of recent papers which have presented similar comparisons within the context of the  fermionic \" or nodal quasi - particle picture , extended , however , to a fermi liquid based interpretation@xcite .",
    "this differs conceptually from the original formulation of lee and wen@xcite because the important mott insulator constraint ( @xmath3 ) is enforced via a hole concentration ( @xmath4 ) dependent landau parameter @xmath5 which then constrains the penetration depth @xmath6 via @xmath7 .",
    "these @xmath4 dependences are considerably different from those of the spin - charge separation approach@xcite which is based on the presumption that @xmath8 is @xmath4 independent .",
    "an underlying philosophy of the present paper is that fundamental features of the pseudogap phase should be accommodated at the outset , before including landau parameter effects .",
    "our viewpoint is different from the phenomenology of lee and wen@xcite because here @xmath9 is associated with _ both _",
    "nodal quasi - particles and bosonic pair excitations . stated alternatively , in the bcs - bec crossover picture there is an important distinction between the order parameter @xmath10 and excitation gap @xmath11 at _ all _ temperatures .",
    "this approach leads to a new mean field - like theory@xcite which incorporates ( i ) the usual bcs equation for @xmath12 and for ( ii ) the chemical potential @xmath13 , along with a third new equation for     plotted in 1c , for various cuprates indicated by the legend in fig .",

    "the first two equations enforce an underlying fermionic constraint so that the bosons of the strong coupling limit _ are different _ from those of a true boson system , such as he@xmath21 . to include the mott insulator constraint the fermi velocity @xmath16",

    "so as not to complicate the logic , we compute the former , by taking the second velocity contribution@xcite @xmath15 as given by a perfect @xmath24-wave model ; thus the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath15 entirely reflects that of @xmath25 , as shown in fig .",

    "2 we show the @xmath4 dependent coefficient of the quadratic term ( 2a ) in the specific heat @xmath27 , along with the linear term ( 2b ) .",
    "the first of these reflects the fermionic quasi - particle contribution ( which depends on @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and the second derives purely from the bosonic contribution .",

    "we know of no other intrinsic origin for this @xmath28 term , which despite its widespread presence is usually attributed to extrinsic effects .",
