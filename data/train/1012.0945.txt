    "observationally , faraday rotation is parameterized by the rotation measure ( rm ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is typically measured in radians and @xmath4 in meters .",
    "the plasma dispersion law predicts rm induced by propagation along a line as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is in @xmath7 and @xmath8 is in @xmath9 g , and @xmath10  is the distance to the source @xcite .",
    "thus , measurements of faraday rotation constrain physical conditions critical to understanding a wide variety of problems .    measurements of rm have expanded our knowledge of magnetic fields in our own galaxy and in other galaxies .",
    "several efforts have been made to compile rm along lines of sight over large areas of the sky @xcite .",

    "( 2009 ; hereafter `` t09 '' ) , have expanded the number of sources with measured rm by nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "this was done by reanalyzing the 1.4 ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , producing rms for 37,543 radio sources located throughout the sky north of declination 40 .",
    "each source was observed in two bands , which , assuming equation [ dtdl ] , can be used to estimate rm .",
    "the high density and large coverage of the sample make it very effective at statistically measuring the structure and strength of the magnetic fields .",
    "however , while the rms are undoubtedly precise , it is not clear that they are accurate .",
    "@xcite first noted that the faraday rotation does not require the polarization angle to change as @xmath11 . when the emitting and faraday - rotating media are mixed or multiple sources with different rm are spatially unresolved , one observes complicated changes in the polarization angle with wavelength @xcite .",
    "these kinds of changes , combined with the possibility of @xmath12 ambiguities in measuring polarization angle , make it difficult to measure rm robustly .",
    "@xcite noted that discrete sampling of the stokes vector in @xmath11-space constrains different kinds of faraday structures .",
    "they introduce the concept of `` rotation measure synthesis '' , which takes advantage of the mathematical similarity between how aperture synthesis is done with multiple antennas and how rm is measured by sampling multiple wavelengths .",
    "the output from this technique is a `` rm spectrum '' showing the amount of polarized brightness as a function of its faraday rotation @xcite .    in parallel with this algorithmic development",
    "has been the technical development of wide - bandwidth radio receivers and digital signal processing . the allen telescope array ( ata ) ,",

    "the array and receiver design are optimized for large surveys @xcite , which could be very powerful in the study of cosmic magnetism .",
    "the coincidence of these new algorithms and technologies for wide - bandwidth polarimetry inspired us to conduct a commissioning survey with the ata .",
    "the first goal of this survey is to test the polarimetry capabilities of the ata telescope design .",

    "the focus was set to the higher frequency , which gives the array good sensitivity in both bands @xcite .",
    "these frequencies were chosen as a rough `` minimum redundant spacing '' in @xmath11-space @xcite , which is important for creating good rm spectra .",
    "the frequencies were also selected such that some portion of their bands were clear of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .    with the goals of testing and demonstrating the power of rm synthesis , we sought a target list of a few tens of sources .",
    "we started with the catalog of polarized sources presented by from the 1.4 ghz nvss data .",

    ", each observing period was scattered with repeated , on - axis observations of 3c 286 . on day 1 ,",
    "3c 286 was not up during the entire observation , so 3c 138 was used to extend the time- and antenna - dependent gain calibration in time ; 3c 286 was always used exclusively for leakage and frequency - dependent gain calibration .",

    "for our observations , gpcal converged to a solution for an observation of 3c 286 over a range of parallactic angle greater than a few tens of degrees . due to a scheduling error",

    "the calibration and visualization of the data taught us several things .",
    "first , a gain amplitude calibration error is an important source of error in stokes q and u. this is the well - known challenge of measuring linear polarization with linear feeds ( i.e. , stokes q is formed by differencing two large numbers , the @xmath15  and @xmath18  visibilities ) .",
    "this kind of error limits us to using data within 1 hour of a gain calibration solution .",
    "second , stokes i can also mix with q and u if one does nt solve for the @xmath16  phase difference for all antennas . in this work , we know the stokes parameters for 3c 286 and can solve for the absolute @xmath16  phase , which we assume does not change within a day .",
    "third , not solving for the absolute leakages of all antennas will cause stokes q and u to mix , potentially biasing the measurement of rm .",
    "fortunately , all of these parameters can be solved for with observations over a range of parallactic angle of a strongly linearly - polarized source like 3c 286 .",
    "figure [ leakages ] plots the @xmath40-polarization leakages for different bands , based on observations of 3c 286 .",
    "the typical magnitude of the leakages is less than 10% , with a few antennas ranging up to 20% .",
    "the leakage changes in frequency by about 3% per 10 mhz with a tendency to make loops in ( real , imaginary ) space .",
    "comparing repeated observations of 3c 286 shows that the leakages change by less than 5% over a time scale of a month .",
    "observations with 3c 286 located off - axis find false stokes ( q , u ) signals typically less than 1% of stokes",
    "i within a third of the half - power point of the primary beam ( @xmath50 at 2.01 ghz ) . applying calibration derived on - axis is likely reliable for the offsets up to @xmath51  considered here .",
    "however , since the errors for off - axis sources are not explicitly measured , results for these sources should be treated cautiously .",
    "the behavior of leakage in the ata is discussed in more detail elsewhere @xcite .      as a first - order check of data quality we inspected the calibrated stokes parameters of simple sources .",

    ", measuring the rm of our calibrator tests the validity of our calibration model and estimates systematic error in the rm measured in the target fields .",

    "for some applications ( e.g. , measuring mean line - of - sight properties ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mean rm is adequate , since it averages over all rm components .",
    "however , any individual component can not be specified more precisely than the beam size due to the uncertainty in the distribution of components within the rm beam .",
    "figure [ compare ] compares the rm components observed here with the results of . since the ata is able to measure multiple significant components per source , the plot shows the relative flux in multi - component sources .",
    "we find that the flux - weighted mean rm of all high - resolution ata components is similar to the low - resolution , rm value .",
    "the most significant potential difference between the ata and values appears in the double source j212344 + 250410/j212345 + 250448 , as discussed in  [ dbl ] .",
    "this confirms that sources with polarized flux densities greater than 200 mjy in do not suffer from @xmath12  ambiguity problems and that their rm values are at least 95% reliable ( more than 35 out of 37 sources ) .",

    "the symbol width scales linearly with the magnitude of the rm , with a minimum width similar to the smallest symbols shown .",
    "[ skydistribution ] ]      as noted in table [ complexfields ] , two pairs of fields in our survey are unresolved by the ata : ( j165111 + 045919 , j165112 + 045917 ) and ( j212344 + 250410 , j212345 + 250448 ) .",
    "these four fields were each observed independently , so they provide a unique test of the quality of ata rm synthesis analysis .    the rm spectra toward j165111 + 045919 and j165112 + 045917 are consistent with each other .",
    "nominally the peak rm is different , but this is a resolution effect , similar to that discussed in  [ resrm ] . the peak rm measured in two spectra is roughly @xmath1205 rad m@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the flux - weighted mean rm of the individual sources reported by , since they are unresolved spatially and spectrally .",
    "the sum of the polarized flux in the two components is about twice that detected here , so the ata is beam depolarized by a factor of 2 .",
    "the rm spectra toward two , unresolved parts of 3c 433 ( j212344 + 250410 and j212345 + 250448 ) are also consistent with each other , showing a single rm component at roughly @xmath12072 rad m@xmath1 .",
    "this value differs significantly from the rm measured by toward the two sources individually , roughly @xmath120125 and @xmath12094 rad m@xmath1 .",
    "the value seen by the ata is similar to the value of @xmath121 rad m@xmath1  seen in single - dish , wide - bandwidth observations @xcite .",
    "the low - resolution rm spectra presented here have sensitivity to similar faraday thicknesses as , so their difference ( and the consistency of the ata and single - dish observations ) may indicate an error in . alternatively , it has been suggested that spatially unresolved pairs of sources can confuse the rm synthesis technique in some cases ( l. rudnick , private communication ) .",
    "we can not distinguish between these possibilities with our current analysis technique .",
    "several previous studies have presented milliarcsecond , very long baseline array ( vlba ) , polarimetric maps of dozens of agn @xcite .",
    "these observations were generally done at higher frequencies , ranging from 5 to 22 ghz . as the vlba observations are at higher frequency and have better spatial resolution , they are less subject to depth and beam depolarization and show a relatively unambiguous view of the polarized emission .",
    "below , we compare the properties observed at high spatial resolution with those of our rm spectra .",
    "rm maps of 3c 273 ( j122906 + 020305 ) from 5 to 22 ghz find time - variable rm with polarized flux density of a few hundred mjy , or a few percent of total intensity @xcite . the rm distribution for the core changes from @xmath122  rad m@xmath1 over year timescales , while the jet ( within 10 mas ) is predominantly from 0 to 1000 rad m@xmath1 . from 1 to 2 ghz , we find two components at @xmath12011 and 151 rad m@xmath1 with polarization fractions of 1 and 0.5% , respectively . while 3c 273 has variable rm and brightness distribution , the 12 ghz observations generally have a lower polarization fraction and rm range than seen by the vlba .",
    "another source showing this kind of frequency dependence is 3c 446 ( see figure [ rmplotlast ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "our observations of 3c 279 ( j125611054720 ) find two rm components at 15 and 66 rad m@xmath1 with polarized brightnesses of 270 and 160 mjy ( @xmath123 and 1.6% of total intensity ) .",
    "the 12 ghz rm is similar to the that seen at 8 ghz with the vlba in june 2000 @xcite , which is much less than that seen at earlier dates @xcite .",
    "the observations of @xcite show two sources at milliarcsecond - resolution with rm of @xmath12091 and 13 rad m@xmath1 and polarized brightnesses of about 1.4 jy ( @xmath124% ) .",
    "intrinsic variability makes it hard to make a strong conclusion , but this similarity suggests that a similar part of 3c 279 is seen from 1 to 8 ghz .",
    "source j225357 + 160853 is 3c 454.3 ( a.k.a .",
    "b2251 + 158 ) , which has a low polarization fraction of @xmath125% at 8 ghz , as compared to 9% in our observations @xcite .",
    "the rm distribution is irregular with a value at peak brightness of @xmath120263 rad m@xmath1 at 8 ghz ; we measure a single component of @xmath12054 rad m@xmath1 from 12 ghz .",
    "this source is a blazar and is highly variable at radio wavelengths , so it is difficult to make strong conclusions in this comparison .",
    "however , monitoring at 43 ghz shows that its polarization fraction rarely reaches 9% @xcite .",
    "if so , this source may have a higher polarization fraction from 12 ghz than at higher frequencies , which differs from the trend observed toward 3c 273 , 3c 446 , and 3c 279 .",
    "field j123039 + 121758 is particularly complicated as it is host to the starburst galaxy m87 and its jet ( see figures [ rmplot2 ] and [ rmplot3 ] ) . comparing the ata observations to previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows a similar bright core and faint jet in total intensity . in polarized intensity",
    "the situation is reversed and the brightest source the ata sees from 12 ghz is the termination of the southwest jet ; in fact , this polarized source is what was identified by our survey selection criteria . in general , the core and other parts of the jet",
    "have varying levels of polarized flux that change rapidly with frequency .",
    "the rm spectra of the core and jet of m87 are amongst the most complicated in this survey .",
    "this is probably not a coincidence , since m87 is one of the few sources that has a core - jet structure resolved by the ata .",
    "the spatial separation allows us to resolve multiple faraday components , which otherwise cause depth depolarization .",
    "still , the dramatic increase in polarized flux in the 1.0 ghz band ( especially in the core ) suggests that there are strong spectral index effects that may confuse the rm cleaning process . also , the rm values measured for the m87 core in the low - resolution rm spectra are very different from those at high - resolution , which is likely related to strong faraday thickness effects . in principle",
    "an algorithm could be developed to disentangle these effects , similar to the `` multi - frequency synthesis '' technique used in synthesis imaging .    for the m87 jet ,",
    "we find rm up to @xmath126  rad m@xmath1 , while in the m87 core the rm ranges up to 100 rad m@xmath1 . despite the relatively large rm we find from 12 ghz",
    ", m87 has an even larger range of known rm values measured by vlba imaging ( @xmath127  rad m@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "limits on rm up to @xmath128 rad m@xmath1 are typically 20 mjy . at the maximum rm ,",
    "this is equivalent to an intrinsic fractional polarization of order 0.5% for our sample .",
    "since this is more than an order of magnitude less than the polarization fraction of typical synchrotron sources , these components are not likely to be faraday - thin synchrotron sources .",
    "the low - resolution rm spectra have a sensitivity to sources with rm thickness up to 75 rad m@xmath1 .",
    "if the faraday thickness is related to a physical thickness , equation [ phi ] requires a physical thickness of @xmath129  pc .",
    "however , it is equally likely that the faraday thickness of the source is caused by multiple rm components that are spatially unresolved .    in general",
    ", the 12 ghz rm spectra do not detect the large polarization fractions and rm values seen by the vlba from 522 ghz .",
    "since the spectral indices for these sources are relatively flat , they should be bright enough to detect from 12 ghz .",
    "that requires that either ( 1 ) the faraday thickness be larger than 75 rad m@xmath1 ( in the low - resolution rm spectra ) , or ( 2 ) the polarized source structure change between 1 and 10 ghz .",
    "high - spatial - resolution polarimetry of quasars has found a decreasing polarization fraction toward lower frequencies @xcite , which suggests that faraday - thickness depolarization occurs even at high spatial resolution .",
    "if this is the sole cause of frequency - dependence of the polarization fraction , the lack of large rm requires that faraday thickness increases with faraday depth .",
    "if so , the typical thickness is larger than 75 rad m@xmath1 for depths larger than @xmath130  rad m@xmath1 , the largest , high - significance rm detected here .",
    "it is also likely that wide - bandwidth rm synthesis analysis can be confused by relative spectral index changes within a source .",
    "@xcite have shown that the spectral index of the 3c 454.3 jet is steeper than that of the core , which suggests that 12 ghz observations will tend to see more of its flux .",
    "the inner core and jet are hosts to the strongest and most organized magnetic fields , where one expects large rm and high fractional polarization .",
    "the outer jet is likely to be interacting with ambient gas , and is thus less organized and has lower rm .",
    "the rm synthesis does not formally account for these relative changes , so some care is required when interpreting rm results from data with large fractional bandwidths .",
    "we have conducted a survey of 37 bright , polarized radio sources from 12 ghz with the ata .",
    "applying polarimetric calibration allows us to measure the full stokes information over this frequency range .",
    "rm synthesis uses these wide - bandwidth spectra to create high - resolution rm spectra , sensitive to rm up to 90000 rad m@xmath1 with a resolution as good as 50 rad m@xmath1 .",
    "observations of 3c 286 show that these data can measure rm with a precision up to 0.6 rad m@xmath1 .    in",
    "the 37 fields observed , 42 sources were brightly polarized enough to perform rm synthesis .",
    "twelve of the 42 sources have multiple rm components with greater than 7@xmath110  significance ( @xmath131  mjy ) , for a total of 61 components . comparing the rm values measured by the ata at high and low rm resolution",
    "show that multi - component rm spectra can bias the measurement of the peak rm of a source .",
    "we show that the peak rm of our sources can not be known to better than 1015 rad m@xmath1 if observed at rm resolution larger than 600 rad m@xmath1 .",
    "more generally , the peak rm can be measured no more accurately than the width of the rm beam . however , for typical applications the mean rm measured by low - resolution rm spectra is not affected by this bias .",
    "the rm spectra measured by the ata confirm the rm results presented by for sources with polarized flux densities greater than 200 mjy .",
    "there is no evidence for @xmath12  ambiguity problems and the narrow - bandwidth vla observations are at least 95% reliable for this sample of sources .",
    "vlba maps with milliarcsecond resolution spatially resolve some components that we identify in rm spectra .",
    "this correspondence suggests that rm synthesis can detect blobs of gas in massive agn jets , which ordinarily must be spatially resolved to be studied .",
    "observations of the time and frequency dependence of faraday thickness and polarization fraction in agn can be compared to simulations to constrain physical models .",
    "we have shown that rm synthesis is useful because it quantifies the full complexity of the faraday rotation process .",
    "future work will exploit the relative ease of the technique to resolve the time - dependent rm structure in agn .",
    "improving calibration models will also enable wide - field , wide - bandwidth rm surveys with the ata and other radio interferometers .",
