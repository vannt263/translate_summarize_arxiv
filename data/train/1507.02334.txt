    "unlike pristine noble metal or graphite basal - plane electrodes used in classical electric double layer ( edl ) studies,@xcite lithium ion battery ( lib ) electrodes generally exhibit complex interfaces.@xcite both electron ( @xmath5 ) and li@xmath0 transport can occur inside lib electrodes .",
    "in addition , solid thin films , on the order 1 - 50  nm thick , are ubiquitous on lib electrode surfaces and can become part of the edl ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a - h ) .",
    "the edl is critical because key battery processes like li@xmath0 incorporation kinetics ( including li@xmath0 desolvation ) , parasitic reactions , li - plating , and degradation - inducing phase transformations on electrode surfaces most likely initiate within it . indeed , `` solid electrolyte interphase '' ( sei ) films@xcite covering anodes are relied upon as kinetic barriers that prevent thermodynamic equilibrium in batteries ; they are critical for lib which operate outside the redox stability window of the organic solvent electrolytes used . as discussed below",
    ", the edl is also crucial in computational work because it effectively determines the electrode potential ( henceforth `` applied voltage '' or simply `` voltage '' ) in the simulation cell .",
    "our work examines edl associated with thin - film coated electrode surfaces , and emphasizes the importance of creating electrode interface models that exhibit consistent electrochemical activities for both li@xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "examples of solid films on electrode surfaces include li@xmath3co@xmath1 layers formed on pristine cathode oxide surfaces;@xcite cathode - coating films made of electrolyte decomposition products;@xcite sei films on anodes arising from reductive decomposition of liquid electrolyte components;@xcite artificial protective / passivating coatings,@xcite including atomic layer deposition ( ald ) layers@xcite which can undergo phase transformations at low voltages;@xcite ald layers between solid electrolytes and electrodes in all - solid state batteries;@xcite and even li@xmath3o@xmath3 films deposited on cathodes during fast discharge of li - air batteries,@xcite the re - oxidation of which is accompanied by significant voltage hysteresis and is a root cause of the lack of a suitable liquid electrolyte in li - air batteries .",
    "detailed atomic lengthscale understanding of the interfaces and edl associated with such thin films has remained elusive , partly due to challenges in imaging buried interfaces at sub - nanometer resolution .",
    "even edls associated with liquid organic electrolyte in batteries have arguably only recently received systematic experimental studies.@xcite modeling efforts have made much progress in elucidating the structures of solid - solid@xcite and solid - vacuum@xcite interfaces .",
    "however , voltage dependences , particularly in processes involving @xmath5 transfer like parasitic reactions and undesirable metal plating , have arguably received less theoretical attention . in this work ,",
    "we apply electronic density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to investigate how voltages affect the structures and stoichiometries of thin solid films , their interfaces , and their edl at atomic lengthscales . in view of the complexities of lib electrodes ,",
    "we have adopted simple model systems .",
    "the liquid electrolyte is omitted , although a few solvent molecules are included as frozen monolayers in some models to illustrate their huge impact on the voltage .",
    "au(111 ) surfaces are adopted as model cathodes , instead of transition metal oxides typically found in batteries .",
    "au does not alloy with li under voltages considered in this work and is a convenient inert electrode .",
    "these systems might be realized in ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) settings ; they dovetail with the use of copper@xcite and gold@xcite electrodes in recent fundamental battery science experimental studies .",

    "li@xmath1po@xmath2 is a non - redox - active solid electrolyte .",
    "it illustrates the correlation between interfacial dipole densities and voltages .",
    "li@xmath3co@xmath1 is often found on as - synthesized cathode surfaces . in lib studies ,",
    "there is disagreement@xcite concerning whether li@xmath3co@xmath1 dissolves upon soaking in electrolyte,@xcite is formed at high voltages,@xcite or is removed at @xmath64  v.@xcite in li - air batteries , li@xmath3co@xmath1 is generally accepted to be oxidized and removed above @xmath74.5  v.@xcite our goal is not to elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism , but to study the electronic and structural signatures accompanying voltage increase .",
    "redox - active limn@xmath3o@xmath2 ( spinel lmo ) is not used as nanometer - thick films in batteries , but its inclusion here helps illustrate the diversity of interfacial behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . like",
    "most lib cathode materials , lmo is a polaron conductor because mn can exhibit multiple redox states .",
    "it also conducts li@xmath0 , but is not a band ( `` metallic '' ) conductor . by classical electrostatics definition ,",
    "the interior of lmo is not instantaneously at a constant potential.@xcite our lmo / au interface model provides a well - defined fermi level ( @xmath8 ) to demonstrate how voltage control is achieved at atomic lengthscales , and how this affects ec oxidative decomposition on lmo surfaces.@xcite    out of necessity , we critically examine the voltage calibration method used in the theortical lib literature ( sec .",
    "[ voltage ] ) .",
    "the same experimental voltage governs li@xmath0 and @xmath5 motion . indeed , in cyclic voltametry , it is difficult to distinguish currents arising from faradaic li - insertion or parasitic processes that involve undesired @xmath5 transfer to the liquid .",
    "but what is `` voltage '' at atomic lengthscales ?",
    "the absolute electrochemical potential for a charged particle in an atomic configuration is the ( free ) energy needed to transfer it into a given phase from infinity ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "there can be differences whether the particle is a li@xmath0 or a @xmath5 . in dft modeling , the electronic voltage ( @xmath9 ) governing electronic motion , and ionic voltage ( @xmath9 ) governing li@xmath0 motion , can and must be distinguished .",
    "first we focus on @xmath9 . under constant voltage experimental conditions , potentiostats directly control the @xmath5 ( not li ) content . when the phase is a metallic conductor with a well - defined @xmath8 , the voltage asociated with transferring @xmath5 from infinity , multiplied by the electronic charge , is equal to the work function ( @xmath10 ) modulo a constant , just like in photovoltaics ( pv)@xcite and electrocatalytic systems.@xcite @xmath10=@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the vacuum level and @xmath8 is set to zero herein without loss of generality .",
    "if the electrode is immersed in liquid electrolyte , @xmath10 calculated for the electrode covered by a sufficiently thick liquid layer , divied by the electronic charge , also gives @xmath9.@xcite @xmath9 applies even under out - of - equilibrium conditions .",
    "it is readily computed in our model systems because vacuum regions exist and qualify as `` infinity . '' in commercial batteries , there is no vacuum .",
    "nevertheless , our focus on @xmath10 is formally correct and emphasizes the synergy between batteries , fuel cells,@xcite pv,@xcite and metal - semiconductor interfaces.@xcite in those research areas , dipoles at interfaces are recognized as properties of paramount importance . at battery liquid - solid interfaces ,",
    "edl s are the manifestations of complex surface dipole distributions associated with applied voltages ; it is in effect our computational potentiostat .",
    "based on our calculations , we propose the manipulation of surface dipoles as a novel electrode passivating strategy ( fig .  [ fig1]b ) .",
    "li@xmath0 ions are only indirectly controlled by potentiostats ; they slowly redistribute in response to changes in electronic configurations .",
    "we define the li `` voltage '' ( @xmath13 ) as the ( free ) energy difference between li chemical potential in a system and the lithium metal cohesive energy per li divided by @xmath14 .",
    "this definition is widely used as the sole voltage estimate in the lib theory literature.@xcite at equilibrium , when the voltage is pinned at the redox potential of li - insertion reactions , @xmath9 must be equal to @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath13 should be considered a self - consistent criterion at interfaces . by itself",
    ", @xmath13 can give incorrect voltages when modeling parasitic processes induced by @xmath5 transfer , and it may not govern the dynamics of li@xmath0 insertion processes adequately .    fig .",
