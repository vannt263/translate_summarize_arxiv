    "[ [ section ] ]    since the work of major and dehmelt@xcite , it has been known that even a single trapped ion immersed in a buffer gas does not equilibrate to the temperature of the buffer gas .",
    "recent work has explained that this is due to a phenomenon , termed ",
    "micromotion interruption\"@xcite , whereby collisions with buffer gas particles disrupt the ion micromotion and couple energy from the time - dependent trapping potential into the kinetic energy of the recoiling ion .",
    "this interruption leads to multiplicative noise in the fluctuation spectrum of the trapped ions and , in turn , to non - maxwellian statistics and power - law tails in the distributions of the steady - state ion energy@xcite .",
    "for this reason , when referring to the  temperature \" , @xmath1 , of the ions , we are in fact referring to the total kinetic energy w per ion given from @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the number of ions , and @xmath4 the boltzmann constant . considering the collisional effects of micromotion interruption , ref .",
    "( @xcite ) has shown that the temperature of a single ion immersed in a buffer gas at temperature @xmath5 decreases exponentially towards a steady - state temperature @xmath6 , according to the rate @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the langevin collision rate , with @xmath9 being the buffer gas density , @xmath10 the cold - atom polarizability , and @xmath11 the atom - ion reduced mass .",
    "the kinetics factor @xmath12  the smallest eigenvalue of a three - dimenional relaxation matrix@xcite  depends on the atom - ion mass ratio @xmath13 and a critical mass ratio @xmath14 , above which , interestingly , the buffer gas heats the ion regardless of ( @xmath15 ) ; for the hybrid system discussed here @xmath16 .",
    "the absolute value of this cooling rate and its dependence on @xmath1 is shown in fig .  1b .",
    "this model assumes an isotropic cold - atom reservoir , isotropic momentum transfer differential cross - section , and does not incorporate short - range dynamics due to the @xmath17 atom - ion interaction .",
    "in addition to this cooling rate , an effective heating rate is introduced when multiple ions are present in the trap , which arises from the mutually repulsive coulomb force between ions .",
    "simply put , while a single ion in a lqt exhibits a stable mathieu trajectory with a conserved average energy , co - trapping of additional ions leads to trajectories whose kinetic energy is not conserved , but grows as work is done on the ions by the time - dependent trapping field .",
    "this heating rate is simply the product of an effective ion - ion collision rate @xmath18 and the fractional increase in ion energy per collision @xmath19 , which vanishes for static traps@xcite , but is nonzero for lqts .",
    "@xmath18 is traditionally approximated using the chandrasekhar - spitzer plasma self - collision rate @xcite , while the determination of @xmath19 is given in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "ultimately , this heating rate can be approximated by @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the electron charge , @xmath22 the permittivity of free space , @xmath23 the coulomb logarithm , @xmath24 the ion density , @xmath25 the ion mass , and @xmath26 the ratio of secular to total kinetic energy ( see methods ) .",
    "the inclusion of the empirically - motivated function @xmath27 extends the applicability of this model from large , three - dimensional ion clouds to small , linear coulomb crystals@xcite ( see methods ) . for fixed @xmath3 , this heating rate displays peculiar behavior as a function of temperature , decreasing at both high and low temperatures due to the concomitant reduction of ion density and highly - correlated ion motion , respectively .",
    "however , at intermediate temperatures , the ions exist in a liquid - like state where they are closely - spaced and strongly - interacting , yet not sufficiently cold to form an ordered structure , resulting in a maximum heating rate as shown in fig .",
    "1b .    by combining these treatments of heating and cooling in a hybrid trap",
    ", we arrive at an analytical model that describes the temperature of multiple trapped ions immersed in a buffer gas .",
    "qualitatively , three regimes exist and are shown in fig .",
    "regime i , which is characterized by small ion number , features only one temperature , @xmath28 , for which the heating and cooling rates are balanced , implying the existence of a unique steady - state for that ion number . in regime",
    "ii , a larger ion number shifts the heating curve upwards , creating two additional intersections between the heating and cooling rates at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "ions initialized with a temperature greater ( less ) than the unstable fixed point at temperature @xmath29 will evolve to the steady - state temperature @xmath30 ( @xmath28 ) . in regime iii ,",
    "an overabundance of ions causes the heating rate to overwhelm the cooling rate leaving only one intersection and steady - state temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the boundaries of these regimes are marked by blue - sky , or saddle - node , bifurcations@xcite where a second steady - state temperature is either created ( i@xmath31ii ) or annihilated ( ii@xmath31iii ) simply by increasing the number of trapped ions by one .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in addition to this analytical model , we perform a md simulation in which ions interact with a time - dependent trapping potential , other co - trapped ions , and a homogeneous buffer gas of cold atoms with a density of @xmath32  @xmath33 ( see methods ) .",
    "the md result naturally includes effects beyond the second moment of the distribution and therefore serves to verify the analytical results at these small ion numbers .",
    "the bifurcation of the ion steady - state temperature is probed by initializing the ions to different temperatures , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and monitoring the evolution of the ion temperature after immersion in the laser - cooled buffer gas . for cold initializations @xmath36  mk , as indicated in fig .",
    "1d by the the blue - shaded region , and for hot initializations @xmath37  k@xmath38  k , as indicated by the red - shaded region .",
    "1c shows the results of ten md trials of both hot and cold initializations for six different ion numbers with immersion times up to @xmath39  s. for comparison , the results from the analytical model using identical parameters and a similar range of initial hot and cold temperatures are shown to the right of each md result .",
    "the left md - model pairings in fig .",
    "1c convey the ion kinetics near the first bifurcation at the transition between regime i and regime ii .",
    "for @xmath40 , both hot and cold initializations quickly tend to the same steady - state temperature @xmath41  mk in roughly @xmath42  s and agree well with the model . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the system remains in regime i , yet the time required for all hot md trials to reach the cold steady - state temperature is considerably longer ( nearly @xmath39  s ) .",
    "this is due to there being only a subset of configurational phase - space in which two ions are able to be cooled by the laser - cooled buffer gas . as the hot ion pair oscillates in the trap",
    ", phase space is sampled until a configuration amenable to this cooling is reached .",
    "at this point , assuming no further cooling - inhibiting rearrangements occur , the ion temperature decreases with a time constant similar to that for the single - ion case .",
    "this sampling of configurational phase space introduces a probabilistic aspect to the cooling process which the analytical model does not incorporate . for @xmath44 , none of the hot trials exhibit cooling even after @xmath39  s , implying that the inclusion of the additional ion renders the probability of reaching a coolable configuration vanishingly small .",
    "instead , the existence of two bifurcated steady - state temperatures , @xmath28 and @xmath30 , are revealed , which is indicative of the transition into regime ii .    the right md - model pairings in fig .",
    "1c depict the ion kinetics near the second bifurcation at the transition between regime ii and regime iii . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the system appears to remain in regime ii as indicated by the two unique steady - state temperatures after @xmath39  s of immersion time .",
    "however , a single md trial is shown to  hop \" from the cold steady state to the hot steady state , hinting at the onset of a transition to regime iii . for @xmath46 ,",
    "every cold trial abruptly hops from the once cold steady state over a @xmath39  s period leading to a unique steady state at @xmath30 . in the small ion - number limit",
    ", heating is the result of discrete collisional events rather than the smooth rates expressed in the analytical model .",
    "thus , the transition from regime ii to regime iii is marked by fluctuations in the ion energy that probabilistically drive the ions into configurations with temperatures above @xmath29 , at which point the ion temperatures converge to the hot steady - state @xmath30 .",
    "as the ion number continues to increase , this hopping happens more rapidly as a result of more frequent collisional events , as shown for @xmath47 in fig .",
    "1c .    finally , fig .",
    "1d shows the mean steady - state temperatures and corresponding standard error of the ten hot and cold trials for twelve different ion numbers .",
    "the hot and cold steady - state temperatures , according to the analytical model , are in good agreement with the md result .",
    "both results clearly identify blue - sky bifurcations near @xmath44 and @xmath48 , demonstrating that nonequilibrium behavior is indeed a hallmark of this hybrid system .",
    "s followed by a recooling period .",
    "two control measurements are included during which the buffer gas is not present .",
    "[ fig : fig2],width=336 ]    [ [ section-2 ] ]    to experimentally probe these bifurcations in our hybrid atom - ion trap , we immerse trapped barium ions in a gas of ultracold calcium atoms .",
    "we measure the steady - state temperature of the trapped ions as a function of both the number of trapped ions @xmath3 and initial ion temperatures , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the apparatus used here is described in methods and elsewhere@xcite .",
    "each measurement begins with a linear coulomb crystal of laser - cooled barium ions ( in the absence of the cold calcium buffer gas ) and is subsequently divided into three steps : initialization , immersion , and recooling ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "hot initialization , demarked by the disappearance of the ion fluorescence in the second frame in fig .  2 ,",
    "is performed by applying white noise to the lqt electrodes ( @xmath39  ms with laser - cooling followed by @xmath39  ms without ) .",
    "cold initialization is performed simply by maintaining the laser - cooling of the ions until the beginning of immersion , as indicated by the persistence of ion fluorescence in the second frame of the cold measurement in fig .  2 .",
    "once initialized , immersion begins by introducing an overlapping buffer gas of @xmath0  mk calcium atoms with a density of @xmath51  @xmath33 and a @xmath52-@xmath53 radius of @xmath54  mm .",
    "collisions between ions and atoms occur for @xmath55  s , equivalent to @xmath56 .",
    "following immersion , the laser - cooled buffer gas is removed and laser - cooling of the ions is resumed . during this recooling period , the reappearance of ion fluorescence ( fig .",
    "2 ) is monitored for up to @xmath57  s. the recooling time , defined as the time needed for the @xmath3 ions to recrystallize , indicated by the marked ( @xmath58 ) images in fig .",
    "2 , serves as an indirect measurement of the steady - state ion temperature , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the hot and cold measurements , we perform two control measurements in which the ions are similarly initialized , but the buffer gas is not present during the immersion phase , precluding steady - state bifurcation . as seen in fig .  2 , the recooling times for the hot and cold measurements are each larger than the respective hot and cold control measurements . for the cold measurements , this is an expected and general trend due to laser - cooling resulting in initial temperatures less than @xmath59  mk .",
    "for the hot measurements in regimes ii and iii , this is due to the fact that the hot initialization aims only to prepare the ions above @xmath29 , which is less than @xmath30 .",
    "we include an additional laser to quickly dissociate calcium dimer ions that are produced through photo - associative ionization in the laser - cooled buffer gas@xcite .",
    "this leads to the creation of a background of calcium ions , due to both the dissociation of the calcium dimer ions _ and _ the direct ionization of excited neutral calcium atoms . to reduce the effect of this background on the barium ions , we choose lqt parameters which render calcium ions unstable and therefore absent shortly ( @xmath60  @xmath61s ) after production .",
    "we estimate the average number of calcium ions in the trap at any given time to be @xmath62 ( see methods ) .",
    "this ca@xmath63 background adds a small but non - negligible heat load to the ions which can also help explain why hot and cold measurements are each larger than the respective hot and cold control measurements .     .",
    "for @xmath64 , statistically different recooling times are observed which then converge for @xmath65 .",
    "shaded regions represent one standard error about the mean recooling times for the control data and do not exhibit bifurcation .",
    "* b , * histograms of recooling times convey the difference ( @xmath64 ) and similarity ( @xmath65 ) in the steady - state temperatures .",
    "* c , * bifurcation diagram of steady - state temperatures , as calculated by a md simulation using experimental conditions , is consistent with the experimentally observed bifurcated feature .",
    "* d , * md calculated traces showing the steady - state evolution for @xmath43 and @xmath66 . * e , * experimental observation of the bifurcation temperature @xmath29 in regime ii by varying the duration of the heating during hot initialization .",
    "below ( above ) @xmath39  ms of heating the recooling times are indicative of the cold ( hot ) steady state and corresponds to @xmath67  k. as expected , data from regime iii does not exhibit this abrupt increase in recooling times.[fig : fig3],width=336 ]    the results of the experiment are shown in fig .",
    "3a , where each point and error bar represent the mean recooling time and its corresponding standard error for each @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath64 , we observe a statistically significant difference between the recooling times of the hot and cold measurements .",
    "this difference is also reflected in the recooling time distributions for the same range of ion numbers , as shown by the top panel of fig .",
    ", the hot distribution is shown to be skewed towards longer recooling times relative to the cold distribution , implying a higher temperature for the hot measurement .",
    "we interpret this as an indication of the system being in regime ii for @xmath64 .",
    "as we increase the number of ions ( @xmath65 ) , we observe statistically similar mean recooling times for both the hot and cold measurements .",
    "this similarity is also reflected by the hot and cold recooling time distributions for @xmath65 , shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "we interpret this as the system completing its transition from regime ii to regime iii and evidence of a blue - sky bifurcation .",
    "the similar recooling times for @xmath40 are evidence of the sympathetic cooling power of the laser - cooled buffer gas , but technically should not be considered evidence of regime i since @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath69 , the experimentally achievable cold - atom densities are insufficient to access regime i  this regime is likely accessible in hybrid traps using cold alkali atoms where densities are typically @xmath70  @xmath39 times larger . also shown in fig .",
    "3a are the recooling times for the hot and cold controls . as expected , without the presence of the buffer gas , no bifurcation in the recooling times is observed .    to further interpret these results",
    ", we perform a md simulation using parameters similar to those used in the experiment which include , for example , non - uniform calcium atom density , electrical noise on the trap electrodes , and production of unstable calcium ions ( see methods ) .",
    "the results of this simulation are shown in fig .  3c",
    ", with each point representing the mean ion temperature and its corresponding standard error after @xmath55  s of immersion for @xmath71 trials .",
    "again , we see a similarly separated region for the same range of ion numbers which gradually closes near @xmath72 .",
    "we find that the gradual and premature closing of the bifurcation , and transition into regime iii , is primarily due to a prevailing heating effect caused by the infrequent and transient presence of unstable calcium ions . without this unwanted heating effect ,",
    "simulations predict the prevalence of regime ii beyond @xmath73 .",
    "the md temperature traces for @xmath42 and @xmath66 ions are shown in fig .",
    "the top panel ( @xmath43 ) reveals the existence of two bifurcated steady - state temperatures indicative of regime ii .",
    "the bottom panel ( @xmath74 ) shows cold traces which exhibit hopping to the hot steady - state as the system transitions into regime iii .",
    "the gradual increase in temperature for cold simulations , illustrated in fig .",
    "3c , is therefore explained by the increasing probability of a steady - state changing hop occurring during the @xmath55  s immersion period .",
    "this probability grows from virtually zero at @xmath43 to near - unity at @xmath74 .",
    "we perform an additional experiment to probe the mean bifurcation temperature @xmath29 , defined as the initial ion temperature above ( below ) which the system tends to the hot ( cold ) steady - state in regime ii for @xmath75 . here , the ions are again preinitialized at laser - cooled temperatures and subsequently heated as before , but now for a _ variable _ duration in order to scan the initial temperature @xmath49 .",
    "following this initialization , the ions are again immersed for @xmath55  s and then recooled . as seen in fig .",
    "3e , ions which are heated for @xmath76  ms are each recooled in @xmath77  s , yet when the heating duration exceeds @xmath39",
    "ms , the recooling times abruptly increase to @xmath78  s. these recooling times are consistent with those of the cold and hot measurements for @xmath75 shown in fig .",
    "3a , respectively .",
    "we therefore interpret this sudden increase in recooling times after @xmath39  ms as evidence of the system hopping from the cold steady - state @xmath28 to the hot steady - state @xmath30 once @xmath79 . with the aid of the md simulation",
    ", we estimate @xmath29 for @xmath75 to be @xmath80    @xmath37  k. as expected for regime iii , we see no evidence of the cold steady - state @xmath28 .",
    "the kinematics responsible for these bifurcations can have serious implications for sympathetic cooling in ion traps .",
    "the interplay between the coulomb logarithm and the ion density results in the maximum ion - ion heating rate occurring at temperatures of a few kelvin .",
    "this means that sympathetic cooling using cryogenic buffer gases could result in ion temperatures significantly greater than that of the buffer gas .",
    "for example , using a @xmath0  k @xmath81he buffer gas with a density of @xmath82  @xmath33 , we estimate the steady - state ion temperature for @xmath83 32 to be @xmath84  k. in fact , using a @xmath85  mk @xmath86he buffer gas with the same density , we _ still _ estimate the steady - state ion temperature to be @xmath84  k. this illustrates the surprising diminishing returns of naively decreasing the buffer - gas temperature in order to reach colder steady - state ion temperatures . with this in mind , the atom - ion collision energies of chemical reaction rates measured using sympathetic cooling in ion traps may need to be reevaluated .",

    "+    to overcome this limitation , high - density buffer gases composed of laser - cooled , highly - polarizable atoms , such as those created in hybrid traps , must be used ( table 1 ) . however , even with current hybrid traps , for more than a critical number of ions , it is only possible to _ maintain _ not _ create _ steady - state ion temperatures near that of the laser - cooled buffer gas . for still larger ion numbers and with certain buffer gases ( typical low - density alkaline - earth gases )",
    ", it may not even be possible to maintain these laser - cooled temperatures ( e.g. for ca ) . in most cases",
    ", these issues can be circumvented either by directly laser - cooling the trapped ions or by sympathetically cooling the ions with co - trapped laser - cooled ions which can maintain ( or simply initialize , in the case of cooling with na and rb gases ) ions at sub - millikelvin temperatures .",
    "our studies have also found that several experimental details , such as finite size of the buffer gas and electrical noise , can have profound effects on the evolution of the ion towards steady state and perhaps could be used to further explore the rich physics of these systems .",
    "for example , the sensitivity of trapped ions to electrical noise demonstrates the interesting possibility of applying tailored time - dependent potentials to trap electrodes to study diverse work protocols and their influence on system dynamics .",
    "this opens the door for the study of arbitrarily - driven nonequilibrium systems , such as extensions of molecular motors and recently realized single - atom heat engines@xcite .",
    "furthermore , using this electrical control , it should be possible to prepare a system at different points in phase space and subsequently monitor its relaxation ( or lack thereof ) , perhaps shedding light on ergodicity in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "additionally future hybrid atom - ion traps can be engineered to allow for the immersion of ions in multiple non - interacting laser - cooled buffer gases .",
    "these multicomponent systems may give rise to interesting phenomena@xcite such as the breakdown of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , further departures from maxwellian velocity distributions , and the non - factorizability of joint position - velocity probability distributions leading to position - velocity sorting .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a theoretical and experimental description of trapped ions immersed in a cold atomic gas , demonstrating the emergence of nonequilibrium behavior , culminating in the observation of a blue - sky bifurcation in the ion steady - state temperature .",
    "the impact of this work is primarily two - fold : first , the cooling power of a laser - cooled buffer gas is only sufficient to cool the translational motion of small numbers of trapped ions .",
    "this has serious implications for hybrid atom - ion traps , which are typically employed to study physics and chemistry at ultracold temperatures , and places limits on the ability to create and maintain cold samples of trapped ions using sympathetic cooling .",
    "if systems with larger numbers of ions are desired , the restricted cooling power necessitates the need for additional cooling , such as sympathetic cooling with co - trapped laser - cooled ions . outside of hybrid trapping , these limitations may impact low - temperature chemical studies that use neutral gases to set reaction energies and the development of mass spectrometers , which use cold neutral gases to collisionally cool analyte ions for increased mass resolution .",
    "this work may also revise the viability of using cold neutral gases _",
    "alone _ as an initialization step for molecular ion qubits in future quantum computation architecture .",
    "finally , the ion - ion heating rate applied in the present work should also be applicable to studies of bistability in laser - cooled trapped ions .",
    "second , this work represents the first experimental realization of the rich nonequilibrium physics which can exist in hybrid traps .",
    "given the precise control afforded by these systems and the ease of implementation of work protocols and dissipative mechanisms , hybrid systems may become precise tools with which to study the complex phenomena of systems existing far from equilibrium .",
    "the cooling rate defined in equation 1 is developed in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the kinetics factor @xmath12 suppresses the cooling rate which accounts for the less - than - unit cooling efficiency per collision . as referred to in the text , this inefficiency is a consequence of ongoing micromotion interruption which results in some collisions leading to cooling and others to heating . as @xmath12 approaches zero , fewer collisions result in cooling .",

    "<S> sympathetic cooling of trapped ions through collisions with neutral buffer gases is critical to a variety of modern scientific fields , including fundamental chemistry , mass spectrometry , nuclear and particle physics , and atomic and molecular physics . despite its widespread use over four decades </S>",

    "<S> we examine the steady - state evolution of up to ten barium ions immersed in a gas of three - million laser - cooled calcium atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we observe and explain emergence of nonequilibrium behavior as evidenced by bifurcations in the ion steady - state temperature , parameterized by ion number . may provide a route to studying nonequilibrium thermodynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> the concept of using a background gas to facilitate the loading of metallic particles into early ion traps was first demonstrated in 1959@xcite . since then , using collisions with cold , chemically - inert gases to sympathetically cool trapped ions has become a general technique in many areas of scientific research . today the sympathetic cooling of ions with neutral buffer gases is routinely used to control the energy scales of chemical reactions@xcite , to improve the performance of commercial mass spectrometers@xcite , and to prepare short - lived exotic nuclei for tests of the standard model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been proposed as a method to initialize qubits in future quantum computation architecture@xcite .    despite the widespread use of sympathetic cooling in ion traps , its kinetics </S>",
    "<S> have not yet been completely described and , likewise , its limitations are still not fully understood . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the cooling process derives from the fact that a system of trapped ions immersed in a cold buffer gas is not an isolated system . </S>",
    "<S> instead , due to the presence of the time - dependent trapping potential , energy is injected and removed from the system over a single trapping cycle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as it is not a true representation of the canonical ensemble , the trapped ions do not tend to thermal equilibrium with the cold buffer gas as one might expect . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> collisions in the ion trap lead to fundamentally nonequilibrium processes which have made it difficult to establish a complete kinetic description of the technique and , as later explained , limits its ability to create and maintain translationally cold temperatures .        to probe this nonequilibrium behavior , </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the collisional processes between trapped ions and a buffer gas of laser - cooled atoms in a hybrid - atom ion trap . in our conception of this apparatus ( shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) , laser - cooled barium ions confined by a linear quadrupole trap ( lqt ) are immersed in a @xmath0  mk gas of magneto - optically trapped calcium atoms . thus far , relatively little work has been done to fully understand the complex statistical mechanics of these hybrid systems@xcite despite being critical to current applications such as observing atom - ion collisions and reactions at cold temperatures@xcite and producing cold molecular ions@xcite . through a more complete understanding of the collisional processes and nonequilibrium phenomena in these systems , which offer precise experimental control , we can establish the general limits of sympathetic cooling ion traps .    in what follows , </S>",
    "<S> we first present a full description of the sympathetic collisional processes in a hybrid trap and how they lead to the emergence of nonequilibrium behavior . </S>",
    "<S> second , we provide the results of a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation that confirms the emergence of nonequilibrium dynamics of small numbers of trapped ions in a laser - cooled buffer gas under idealized conditions . </S>",
    "<S> third , we describe an experiment in which we immerse laser - cooled barium ions in a gas of ultracold calcium atoms and observe the hallmark of this nonequilibrium behavior : bifurcation of the ion steady - state temperature as parameterized by trapped ion number . </S>",
    "<S> last , remark on what these findings entail regarding the limits of sympathetic cooling of trapped ions with neutral buffer gases , we discuss the implications of the results on current hybrid trap experiments , and expound on ways to engineer future hybrid traps to tailor more diverse sources of heating and cooling to model a variety of nonequilibrium systems . </S>"
