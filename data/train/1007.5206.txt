    "<S> we discuss the elliptic flow dependence on pseudorapidity and number of participating nucleons in the framework of string percolation , and argue that the geometry of the initial overlap region of interaction , projected in the impact parameter plane , determines the experimentally measured azimuthal asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we found good agreement with data .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of the large elliptic flow @xmath0 was one of the most important achievements at rhic experiments [ 1 - 9 ] . </S>",
    "<S> a non vanishing anisotropic flow exist only if the particles measured in the final state depend not only on the local physical conditions realized at the production but as well on the global event geometry . in a relativistic local theory , </S>",
    "<S> this non local information can only emerge as a collective effect , requiring interactions between the relevant degrees of freedom , localized at different points of the collision region . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic flow is particularly unambiguous and convincing manifestation of collective dynamics in heavy ion collisions [ 10 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the elliptic flow @xmath0 can be qualitatively explained as follows . in a collision at high energy </S>",
    "<S> the spectators are fastly moving opening the way , leaving behind at mid- rapidity an almond shaped azimuthally asymmetric region of qcd matter . </S>",
    "<S> this spatial asymmetry implies unequal pressure gradients in the transverse plane , with a larger density gradient in the reaction plane ( in- plane ) . as a consequence of subsequent multiple interactions between degrees of freedom </S>",
    "<S> this spatial asymmetry leads to an anisotropy in momentum plane . </S>",
    "<S> the final particle transverse momentum is more likely to be in- plane than in the out- plane , with @xmath1 as predicted [ 11 ] </S>",
    "<S> .    the basic idea of our model [ 12 ] is that the angular azimuthal anisotropy associated to the geometry of the first stages in the collision - the projected almond- influences in a determinant way the presence or not of the flow . in other words if the projected overlap region was a circle we would have @xmath2 . as in the almond case the small axis is in the reaction plane , corresponding to higher matter density , then @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> our model was introduced in [ 12 ] and a discussion of applications and conjectures were presented dependence of @xmath0 on the produced hadron , validity of quark counting rules , applications to nuclear reduction factors , etc . here </S>",
    "<S> we just want to call attention to @xmath0 as a function of pseudorapidity @xmath3 and the number of participants @xmath4 for nucleus a , after the integration over @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the triangle shape shown by the data on the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 it is not easy reproduced by models as it has been recently emphasized [ 13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we show that string percolation model is able to do it .    </S>",
    "<S> the string percolation model [ 14 ] develops around the concept of transverse density @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of longitudinal strings formed in the collision , @xmath9 is the radius of the single string and @xmath10 the effective radius of the interaction overlap region @xmath11 in the impact parameter b , @xmath12 with @xmath13\\ ] ] , @xmath14 being the nuclear radius and @xmath15    two relations , one for the particle density @xmath16 and the other for the average transverse momentum squared define the essential features of the model [ 13,14 ] @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are single string parameters and @xmath21 is the colour reduction factor [ 15 ] : @xmath22 we introduce now two reasonable approximations : that @xmath23 is proportional to the number of binary collisions and that @xmath10 is proportional to the proton radius , @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are proton parameters and @xmath4 is the number of participants from nucleus a.    from ( 1 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) we obtain @xmath28    by using ( 9 ) and ( 1 ) on ( 5 ) one obtains @xmath29 , and we observe that the right hand side of ( 11 ) and ( 6 ) are deeply related .    </S>",
    "<S> this kind of results appears in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) [ 16 ] and in string percolation [ 14,17 ] . </S>",

    "<S> we started with schwinger gaussian formula , including fusion and percolation ( via @xmath21 ) and clustering fluctuations ( via the parameter @xmath32 ) to obtain[18 ] : @xmath33 most of the rhic data are well described by formula ( 13 ) [ 12,18,19 ] .    in order to discuss directional production along the azimuthal angle @xmath34 </S>",
