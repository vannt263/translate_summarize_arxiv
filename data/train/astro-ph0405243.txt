    "high - latitude extensions from the interstellar medium ( ism ) in spiral galaxies are important probes of disc stability and energetics , halo dynamics , and the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution .",
    "these features are best detected in edge - on galaxies , in which extraplanar emission can be clearly separated from the underlying disc .",
    "discrete features ( e.g. arcs , plumes , and filaments in various ism tracers , or ` supershells ' in as well as broader - scale structures such as thick discs or haloes ) have now been identified in many galaxies using this approach . this has led to ideas of galactic circulation involving ` fountains ' , ` chimneys ' , or possibly outflowing winds which may enrich the intergalactic medium ( shapiro and field 1976 , bregman 1980 , norman and ikeuchi 1989 , heckman , armus & miley 1990 , breitschwerdt , vlk & mckenzie 1991 , breitschwerdt , mckenzie & vlk 1993 ) .",
    "disc - halo features are usually attributed to underlying drivers such as supernovae and stellar winds",
    ". however , these processes alone may be insufficient to produce the highly energetic supershells seen in some galaxies , or to account for the absence of detectable star formation regions or remnants in others ( e.g. rhode et al .",
    "1999 , perna & gaensler 2004 ) .",
    "thus , while star formation may be a key ingredient in the disc - halo phenomenon , it may not , alone , be sufficient to drive disc - halo dynamics .",
    "impacting clouds have long been invoked as a possible alternative ( tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 , santilln et al .",
    "1999 ) , but galaxies that are apparently isolated also sometimes display large supershells ( king & irwin 1997 , lee & irwin 1997 ) .",
    "this has led to speculation about other possible contributors , including gamma - ray bursts ( efremov , elmegreen & hodge 1998 , loeb & perna 1998 ) , inflated bubbles from radio jets ( gopal - krishna & irwin 2000 ) and magnetic fields ( kamaya et al .",
    "environmental effects have also been invoked to explain a variety of halo phenomena , such as differing extents of radio ( dahlem , lisenfeld & golla 1995 ) and x - ray haloes ( wang , chaves & irwin 2003 ) among various edge - on systems .",
    "this paper represents an attempt to further characterize the importance of environment in driving disc - halo dynamics .",
    "a first problem is the lack of information about the environments of galaxies showing disc - halo outflows .",
    "we have therefore obtained maps of the large - scale in the edge - on galaxy ngc  5433 using the very large array ( vla ) in its c and d configurations .",

    "the latter are also present in the c+d data , and are consistent with the residual maps in figs  [ fig6]d and  [ fig6]f . considering features in this velocity range to represent a coherent structure , we compute @xmath38 from equation ( 1 ) , again consistent with the mass computed for f3 in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a .    the p - v slice through the top part of f3 ( fig .",

    "the diameter of the shell - like feature is 50 km s@xmath25 in velocity and 25 arcsec ( @xmath273 kpc ) in right ascension .",
    "an estimate of the mass from this p - v slice only is @xmath42 . under the assumption that the shell is expanding ,",

    "a p - v slice through the lower part of f3 ( fig .  [ fig7]c ) shows more emission at a similar velocity , and is typical of what is seen in other slices through this feature .",

    "we return to plausible formation scenarios for features in ngc  5433 in  [ disc3 ] .",
    "ngc  5433 is in a richer environment than previously thought , having at least 3 physical companions ( kug  1359 + 326 , sis-1 , sis-2 ) rather than the 2 inferred through proximity and size alone ( kug  1359 + 326 , cgcg  191 - 037 ) .",
    "we suspect that other faint maps galaxies in the field might also be detectable in with observations of greater sensitivity .",
    "since we do not detect either or 20  cm continuum emission from cgcg  191 - 037 , its relationship to the detected galaxies remains unclear ; observations with a wider bandpass would resolve this issue .",
    "if the more distant nog companion ic  4357 is included , the group size increases to 5 ; observations of ic  4357 of similar sensitivity to those presented here may also reveal physical companions , making the group richer still .",
    "we note that the x - ray detection reported for ngc  5433 ( rephaeli et al .",
    "1995 ) may represent hot intergalactic gas , sometimes found in poor groups ( fukazawa et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it is interesting that all confirmed group members differ in velocity from ngc  5433 by no more than 70 km s@xmath25 ( table  [ global_params ] ) .",
    "sis-1 , for example , at a projected separation of 248 kpc , is separated in velocity from ngc  5433 by only 25  @xmath31 .",
    "thus the projected separation of the galaxies may be close to their true separation .",
    "in addition , within 20 arcmin of ngc  5433 there are over 3 times as many 2mass galaxies ( 12 vs. 4 ) and 2 times as many optically detected galaxies ( 14 vs. 7 ) in the ne+sw quadrants than in the nw+se quadrants .",
    "we thus speculate that the ne - sw orientation of the galaxies in this study may represent the largest systems in a  true \" filament at least @xmath74  kpc in size ( the separation between ngc  5433 and ic  4357 ) , with little variation in depth .",
    "thus the group geometry is in qualitative agreement with galaxy structures on larger scales found in surveys ( e.g. cross et al .",
    "2001 ) and simulations of hierarchical structure formation via gravitational collapse ( e.g. bertschinger 1998 ) .",
    "there is evidence that interactions are taking place in the group , either among the detected galaxies or with a hot intergalactic medium .",
    "ngc  5433 , itself , shows some optical curvature ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and has an asymmetric distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , with more near the close companion sis-2 .",
    "all of the detected companions show peculiarities in their morphology .",
    "the channel maps of kug  1359 + 326 reveal a large extension that could be tidal in origin ( figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] ,  [ fig10]a ) , and the galaxy s velocity field is highly distorted ( fig .",
    "[ fig10]b ) .",
    "moment maps of sis-1 ( figs .",
    "[ fig10]c ,  [ fig10]d ) show a kinematically distinct feature roughly aligned with the galaxy s major axis , and the peak in sis-2 is offset from the optical centre ( fig .",
    "[ fig10]e ) .",
    "indeed , the better we resolve a companion to ngc  5433 , the more distorted its morphology and kinematics appear .",
    "this leads us to suspect that sis-2 may indeed be strongly interacting with nearby ngc  5433 , but that evidence of the encounter is concealed by our poor spatial and spectral resolution of this companion .      since ngc  5433 is a starburst ( see fig . 2 of irwin et al .",
    "1999 ) it seems plausible that the observed high - latitude extensions are generated by an internal mechanism .",
    "a number of scenarios are consistent with the data .",
    "symmetries in features about a galaxy midplane have previously been attributed to a single event in the underlying disc ( chaves & irwin 2001 ) .",
    "if this is the case for f2 and f3 ( fig .  [ fig4]a ) , it is puzzling that we do not find extensions corresponding to f2 in the same channels as those harbouring the shell attributed to f3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]b ) . on the other hand , the double peak in f3 itself and the presence of 20 cm continuum loops in the same vicinity ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]a ) suggest a common origin for all of these features ; their locations relative to the galaxy nucleus give the impression of a broad - scale nuclear outflow on the west side of the galaxy .",
    "alternatively , the apparent correlation between the continuum and features is also consistent with a galactic fountain generated by energetic events in the disc ( e.g. lee et al . 2001 ) .",
    "none the less , one can not dismiss the role of ngc  5433 s active environment in the generation of the detected extraplanar features .",
    "for example , observations of 3 systems with low mass companions by van der hulst & sancisi ( 2003 ) all show evidence for gas accretion on to the parent discs .",
    "conversely , tidal interactions may pull gas out of the midplane of large spirals , sometimes forming arcs and plumes with similar morphologies to supershells ( taylor & wang 2003 ) . in the galaxy ,",
    "the origins of some high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) have been attributed to these processes ( e.g. putman et al .",
    "we speculate that a similar scenario applies to ngc  5433 : given the inferred upper limits on the masses of hvc analogues in external systems ( e.g. pisano et al .",
    "2004 ) , they would not be detectable in our data",
    ". tidal interactions between ngc  5433 and its smaller companions may be responsible for the observed extraplanar emission , either via direct impacts , tidally induced spurs , or by fuelling the increased star formation found in the disc .",
    "additional multi - wavelength observations , particularly high - resolution x - ray data as well as high - sensitivity and h@xmath39 maps , are needed to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "indeed , the environment can be a key component in the formation of _ both _ externally and internally generated high - latitude features .",
    "we have presented spatially resolved observations of the edge - on starburst galaxy ngc  5433 and its environment .",
    "we find that ngc  5433 has an asymmetric distribution with more gas in the southern half of the disc , and global properties typical of its new sc classification .",
    "the main disc emission is best modelled with a gaussian ring at @xmath75 kpc in the plane with an exponential scale - height @xmath76 kpc ; the addition of a gaussian radial distribution with a characteristic width of @xmath77 kpc marginally improves the fit .",
    "further examination of the data and model residuals reveals 3 extraplanar features , that we label f1  f3 .",
    "we identify coherent extensions in consecutive velocity channels corresponding f1 and f3 , and find a complete loop in p - v space at the location of f3 .",
    "taking this as the signature of an expanding shell the required injection energy is @xmath0 ergs , a value comparable to that found in galactic and other extragalactic supershells . now detected in systems with a variety of star formation rates and in diverse environments , it appears that coherent extraplanar emission requiring such large input energies is a common phenomenon in spiral galaxies .",
    "ngc  5433 is in a richer environment than previously thought .",
    "we confirm that kug  1359 + 326 is indeed a physical companion to ngc  5433 , and detect two other dwarf galaxies with maps identifiers in the field that we label sis-1 and sis-2 .",
    "including the more distant companion ic  4357 we find that ngc  5433 is the dominant member of a group with at least 5 members , spanning over 750  kpc in a filamentary structure . optical and distortions in ngc  5433 itself , and in particular the pathologies in the velocity fields of the better - resolved companions , indicate that interactions are occurring in the vicinity of ngc  5433 , either among the galaxies or with hot intergalactic gas that may be present in the group",
    ".    a variety of underlying mechanisms are consistent with the extraplanar feature morphologies in ngc  5433 .",
    "the locations of the two peaks in f3 and their apparent correspondence with 20 cm radio continuum loops in a high - resolution map suggest that either a large nuclear outflow or a galactic fountain is at work",
    ". however , the active environment in ngc  5433 may be partly responsible for the extensions , either via direct impacts , tidal displacement of material from the midplane or by enhancing star formation in the disc .",
    "we argue that environmental effects may play a role in both internally and externally generated high - latitude extensions in spiral galaxies .",

    "[ obsred ] .",
    "the application of standard flux , phase and bandpass calibration routines to the data revealed undulations at constant declination in the central channels of all our ( independently obtained ) datasets .",
    "the culprit was the 1400 mhz band centre adopted for the observations : with this setup , correlated noise from the 7th harmonic of the vla s 200 mhz local oscillator at l - band contaminated the shortest east - west baselines in the central channels , for which the expected fringe rate is zero ( bagri 1996 ) .",
    "for each calibrated dataset , this rfi was excised by _ a ) _ removing baselines with east - west projections close to the array centre _ in all channels _ , and _",
    "b ) _ clipping contaminated data on amplitude in the visibility domain from the _ infected central channels only_. we apply @xmath4 to all channels because existing aips software did not allow channel selection , and because no flux is lost from the initially rfi - free channels with this approach ( see below ) .",
    "the data were edited iteratively until a combination of parameters in methods _ a ) _ and _ b ) _ yielded the lowest rms level @xmath19 in the central channels while eliminating the rfi at that level . in the end , baselines with east - west projections within 20 metres of the array centre were flagged in each cube with the aips task uvnou , and the optimum central channel clip levels for method _ b ) _ were found to be 1.5 and 0.8 jy for the c and d configuration datasets , respectively .",
    "for both methods @xmath4 and @xmath5 combined , 9 per cent of the baselines were removed in the central channel ( @xmath78 ) for the c data , and in the d data 7 per cent of the baselines were excised at this velocity .",
    "for all datasets , we measure a @xmath79 per cent increase in @xmath19 at @xmath78 relative to the corresponding datacube mean .",
    "the same editing scheme was also applied in the channels adjacent to @xmath78 that exhibited low - level striping ; in all cases less than 3 per cent of baselines were removed , and less than a 5% increase in @xmath19 was measured in the resulting maps at these velocities .",
    "we verified that editing the rfi - free channels using method _ a ) _ had no effect on the emission detected at those frequencies by imaging calibrated cubes in which the editing had and had not been applied : we find no coherent structures in a difference map of those cubes in these channels . to test for a systematic decrease of the flux in ngc  5433 in the central channels due to rfi excision with methods _ a ) _ and _ b ) _ , we removed the same baselines in adjacent channels ( that did nt exhibit rfi ) and imaged them .",
    "we examined the difference between the images obtained without this additional editing and those for which it had been applied , in the vicinity of ngc  5433 . in these residual maps , there is emission near ngc  5433 with flux at a level @xmath80 of the input cubes at @xmath81 and @xmath78 in the c - configuration data .",
    "this implies that the excision of rfi has resulted in a loss of flux in ngc  5433 at these velocities .",
    "we note that this exercise is strictly valid only if the content in the channels used in the test is identical to that in the central channels . at the resolution of our maps ,",
    "the distribution of is similar near the systemic velocity of the galaxy , as is the total flux ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the residual map excess does indeed represent the extent of flux loss in ngc  5433 .    because the potential flux loss is on the order of the map noise we do not correct for missing flux in any of our maps , nor do we expect our conclusions drawn from an examination of hi moment maps to change . for global parameter computations requiring flux estimates of ngc  5433 in these central channels , we associate an additional , _ systematic error _ with the measured values , at twice the difference map peak flux in the vicinity of ngc  5433",
    "this systematic error is represented by the dotted portion of the total error bars on these channels in the global profile of fig .",
    "we have repeated this exercise for the detected companions of ngc  5433 with emission in those channels in the c+d data .",
    "we find no evidence for any flux loss , likely due to their smaller extent and distance from the phase centre .",
    "we conclude that removing unwanted 1400 mhz interference from our data raises @xmath19 at @xmath78 by @xmath2710 per cent relative to each datacube mean , and that in the c configuration data the central 2 channels may bias the measured flux for ngc  5433 by an amount of order @xmath19 ( see fig .",
