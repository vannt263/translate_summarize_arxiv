    "recently @xcite , we revived old approach to planar confining qft @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this revival was the observation @xcite that the @xmath4 theory being regularized by a sharp cutoff in the vicinity of its @xmath5 boundary leads to the mass spectrum exactly the same as suggested in @xcite , namely roots of bessel functions .",
    "it was proven only for conserved currents 2-point functions of @xmath6 , where there were no corrections to anomalous dimensions of conformal operators .",
    "however , the regularization in @xcite following solely from unitarity and analyticity , there are strong reasons to believe that general formulas , with anomalous dimensions as indexes of bessel functions also apply to regularized @xmath7 theory .",
    "this would be an exciting phenomenon : exact relation which holds in ( regularized ) @xmath7 theory to all orders in coupling constant .",
    "recent nonperturbative computations @xcite of anomalous dimensions in @xmath8 sym theory as functions of coupling constant make this conjectured relation even more exciting .",
    "can we now do something about the mass spectrum in confining @xmath9 ? at phenomenological level we know that pad method works for qcd with vacuum condensates ( @xcite ) .    before presenting the results of this paper , let me explain how and why the mass spectrum is related to the ope .",
    "it is relatively simple to go from the spectrum to the ope , but not so simple to go the other direction .",
    "take the sum of pole terms@xmath10    and apply the euler summation formula@xmath11 _ { n=0}\\ ] ]    this produces asymptotic expansion ( with @xmath12 being bernoulli numbers ) @xmath13   _ { n=0}\\ ] ]    with the first term corresponding to replacement of discrete sum by an integral , and the rest being corrections .",
    "we can introduce the density of the spectrum , assuming we know analytic continuation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 to continuous values of @xmath16 @xmath17    and rewrite this expansion as an integral plus corrections@xmath18   _ { s = m_{0}^{2}}\\ ] ]    the first term would produce the continuum spectrum , corresponding to leading order of asymptotic freedom.the higher bernoulli terms will produce powerlike corrections , proportional to negative integer powers of @xmath19 . those must correspond to the higher terms of ope , or else they must vanish .",
    "take the simplest possible anzatz , the notorious psi function with@xmath20    it corresponds to constant spectral density , and so , the only corrections to the leading term @xmath21 will come out as integer negative powers .",
    "that clearly contradicts the spectrum of ope for large n ym , where there are no conserved currents except energy tensor .",
    "all dimensions are known to get perturbatively renormalized , so that there must be calculable fractional powers of @xmath21 in front of negative integer powers .",
    "such terms can only come from the integral term , due to some nontrivial behavior of discontinuity@xmath22    which must posses all these powers of @xmath19 and @xmath21 . at the same time we observe that all the bernoulli terms must vanish identically , otherwise there would be fake operators with integer dimensions in our theory .",
    "this provides highly nontrivial restrictions on the mass spectrum @xmath23 and residues @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we see that there are some hidden connections between the spectrum of anomalous dimensions of perturbation theory and the physical mass spectrum , and given the mass spectrum it is straightforward to compute the uv asymptotic expansion and compare it with the ope , and thus verify correctness of the hypothesis about spectrum .",
    "our goal in this paper is to elaborate the same hidden connection between masses and anomalous dimensions going the other way- from asymptotic freedom to the physical spectrum .",
    "this way is much harder , but not impossible , as i have shown 35 years ago .    in this paper",
    "we continue investigation of pad regularization .",
    "we rederive , debug and reinterpret old formulas of @xcite , and we make some new advances and insights .",
    "we are not going to assume conformal symmetry but rather consider an arbitrary large @xmath24 qft with confinement , i.e. discrete spectrum of states in every channel .",
    "the specific structure of @xmath6 and its @xmath25 correspondence will not be used here .",
    "as it was discussed at length in @xcite one must use the matrix pad approximant rather than scalar one .",
    "nothing changes in principle except necessity to keep track of order of matrix multiplication .",
    "we carry out this matrix pad approximation to the end for the case of arbitrary symmetric conformal tensors , where the 2-point function is the matrix in space of @xmath26 representation . as a result",
    "we get new rich mass spectrum for such conformal tensors , overlooked in previous work .",
    "the essence of our method is to impose on the n - point functions in momentum space their correct analytic properties , i.e. meromorphicity . in case of 2-point function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 we demand that it only has poles , all located on the right semi - axis .",
    "we shall suppress the matrix indexes so far and restore them later .",
    "we call this transformation * meromorphization*:@xmath29   &   = \\frac{p(t)}{q(t)},\\label{meromorphization}\\\\ p(t )   &   = g(t)q(t)-\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{ds}{\\pi(s - t)}\\delta_{s}g(s)q(s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is discontinuity of @xmath27 across the cut at positive real axis @xmath31 .",
    "the entire function @xmath32 here is chosen in such a way that the dispersion integral here decreases faster than any power , i.e. all the laurent expansion coefficients of this integral at infinity must vanish:@xmath33    the motivation for this requirement is that these negative power terms in asymptotic expansion of @xmath27 come from the ope , with coefficients proportional to vev of various operators with vacuum quantum numbers , such as traces of powers of @xmath34 in ym theory .",
    "we would like to preserve all such terms while adding our corrections , so that these corrections are exponentially small at large momenta .",
    "note , that in case ( which we would like to eventually achieve ) when the mass spectrum is given by the roots of @xmath32 the extra term we add will become identically zero , because @xmath35 in this case .",
    "in other words , * meromorphization is an identical transformation of the full theory * , with the purpose to improve the perturbation expansion .",
    "the physical meaning of meromorphization is to declare that the theory is an infinite collection of free fields @xmath36 with various masses and couplings to the gauge invariant ym sources @xmath37 conjugate to operators @xmath38 in ym theory.@xmath39    the mass spectrum is given by vanishing eigenvalues of infinite matrix @xmath40 and the 2-point function will factorize as @xmath41 . as it was discussed in the previous paper ,",
    "the matrix pad approximation of @xmath42 provides precisely the same representation , disguised in a form of right or left multiplication @xmath43 the asymptotic results at large order @xmath44 of the approximant are the same , and they can be proven to be factorized as required by free field theory , with real masses and real coupling constants .",
    "this remarkable coincidence follows from the general theorems of pad theory for the stiltjes matrix functions .",
    "in particular , positivity and factorization was explicitly demonstrated in the previous paper .",
    "there are more subtle theorems , such as monotonous decrease of approximated mass spectrum with the rank @xmath24 of pad approximant , and theorems about absolute convergence of approximant in complex plane of @xmath19 .",
    "do not let the word `` approximation '' mislead you .",
    "the so called approximant is a rational matrix function , with coefficients , satisfying certain linear matrix equations : so called pad equations .",
    "these equations are usually solved numerically , which we are * not * going to do .",
    "we rather find * exact * solutions of these equations for arbitrary order @xmath44 of numerator and denominator polynomials .",
    "this solution represents certain integral transformation of the matrix function @xmath27 which transformation can be defined exactly in every order of perturbation theory of ope .",
    "then we find drastic simplification in the limit of large @xmath44 which allow us to go further with the mass spectrum computation .",
    "we start from pad approximation of @xmath27 near large euclidean point @xmath45 in the limit when the orders @xmath44 of pad approximant both go to @xmath46 at fixed @xmath47 .",
    "this @xmath48 has dimension of length , so that conformal symmetry is explicitly broken .",
    "it may be restored in the limit @xmath49 . in case of precisely conformal field theory , such as sym dual to ads string",
    ", we are looking for dynamic mechanisms enhancing this conformal symmetry breaking ( by vev of composite fields ) so that it persists in a limit @xmath49 .",
    "this is similar to introduction of small magnetic field into ferromagnetic below curie point to obtain spontaneous magnetization in a limit of vanishing magnetic field .    in case of running coupling constant under consideration in this paper , the conformal symmetry is broken already in the second loop .",
    "it would be convenient , however , to separate the effects of renormalization of anomalous dimensions , preserving conformal symmetry of ym theory , and effects from running coupling constant leading to asymptotic freedom and - as we all  hope  confinement .",
    "we study all these effects in some detail in this paper , to review and extend the old results @xcite .",
    "few words about relation of two large space scales : confinement scale @xmath50 which is exponentially large in perturbation theory , and our regulator scale @xmath48 which we eventually must tend to infinity to recover original theory .",
    "we start with the opposite limit of @xmath51 which is like placing our qft in a box size @xmath48 much smaller than confinement radius . in this limit",
    "the spectrum is obviously discrete in every order of perturbation expansion in running coupling @xmath52 .",
    "then , we start increasing @xmath48 and develop the technique of extrapolating the mass spectrum to the physical limit of @xmath53 in which limit we recover original theory .    the general theorems of pad theory for stiltjes functions are crucial for this extrapolation .",
    "these theorems state that the position of poles of approximant monotonously decrease as functions of its order . in our case",
    "this means that mass spectrum is monotonously decreasing as @xmath48 passes the confinement scale @xmath54 and goes to infinity .",
    "nothing pathological like landau pole can happen with this definition of running scale .",
    "confinement would correspond to a finite limit of every mass in the spectrum at @xmath55 .",
    "we find the way to redefine the running coupling @xmath0 so that it also reaches the finite limit , namely @xmath56 .",
    "we argue that series expansion in this running coupling @xmath0 has finite radius of convergence , ( precisely @xmath56 ) .",
    "the expansion terms are calculable , so that the problem is to extrapolate the series to the weak singularity ( infinite first derivative ) at the convergence radius .",
    "this approach was initiated in the old work ( @xcite ) but here we find new powerful method to compute terms of expansion , and also correct some old errors .",
    "we derive all the relevant meromorphization formulas from scratch in appendix , correcting some errors and typos along the way ( including some which propagated into the recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "the end results in the limit @xmath57 are quite simple .",
    "first , let us study the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath32 .",
    "the two terms can be combined as a single contour integral@xmath59    where @xmath60 encircles anti - clockwise both the pole at @xmath61 and singularities of @xmath62 at positive real axis .",
    "s-plane.epsc:/whitepapers/physics/meromorphization/graphics/s-plane__1.pdf    the contour can not be closed in the left semiplane because of exponential growth of @xmath63 .",
    "the collision of singularities at @xmath64 in this contour integral does not lead to any singularities because they do not pinch the contour .",
    "so , @xmath58 is an entire function as well .",
    "its expansion coefficients @xmath65 in powers of @xmath66 are given by the following contour integral ( in all subsequent formulas we choose @xmath48 as a unit of length)@xmath67    let assume that we know the mellin transform of @xmath62@xmath68    where @xmath69 encircles the singularities of @xmath70 .",
    "substituting this into relation for @xmath65 we get@xmath71    the last integral here is nothing but an expansion coefficient @xmath72 of @xmath32 analytically continued to complex values of @xmath16@xmath73    this is quite a remarkable relation .",
    "once the coefficients @xmath72 of the entire function @xmath32 are known as analytic functions of index @xmath16 the other entire function @xmath58 is as good as known .",
    "we shall see below how this relation works in practice , within planar graph expansion .",
    "in general case , of many point function , it can be represented within planar graph expansion as multiple mellin integral @xcite of various planar kinematical invariants",
    "@xmath74    meromorphization in variable @xmath75 would correspond to multiplication by @xmath76 and contour integration as before .",
    "we will get multiple power series expansion in numerator and product of @xmath77 in denominator@xmath78   = \\int d\\omega(\\omega)f^{n}\\left (   \\omega _ { .. } \\right )   \\prod_{<ab>}\\frac{\\sum_{n_{ab}=0}^{\\infty}\\left (   -s_{ab}\\right )   ^{n_{ab}}q_{n_{ab}-\\omega_{ab}}}{q(s_{ab})}\\ ] ] below , we carry out this procedure to the end for conformal 3-point vertex .",
    "the equation for @xmath72 is less trivial than equation for @xmath65 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath70 is given by sum of two terms@xmath79 where @xmath80 is the extreme right pole of @xmath70 with the residue @xmath81 in terms of @xmath27 this corresponds to powerlike behavior .",
    "the second term ( which can also have singularities at @xmath82 ) will be treated as perturbation .",
    "this term , to be studied in the next chapter , sums up all the effects of running coupling constant , and starts from the second order in perturbation expansion . as it follows from general relation derived in appendix , the coefficients @xmath83",
    "satisfy the following equation @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86    the same formulas also provide analytic continuation for complex values of @xmath87 .",
    "let us consider first the leading term , corresponding to conformal theory , and let us now restore the length scale @xmath48@xmath88    the meromorphized 2-point function reduces to the ratio of bessel functions@xmath89    in special case of integer @xmath90 corresponding to conserved currents , the residue @xmath91 must grow inversely proportional to @xmath92@xmath93    so that ( up to irrelevant additive regular term @xmath94 ) the 2-point function becomes@xmath95    with first term corresponding to its conformal limit",
    ".    the physical limit corresponds to large @xmath48 where the correction to power term decays exponentially , as @xmath96 , except at positive @xmath19 where @xmath97 has infinite number of poles with positive residues .",
    "these properties follow from the general theorems of pad theory for stiltjes functions ( for readers convenience the proof of positivity was reproduced in @xcite ) .",
    "the physical meaning is transparent : these are the composite states of our large @xmath24 theory in conformal approximation .",
    "note that exponentially decaying corrections to the scaling limit in momentum space correspond to analytic terms in coordinate space , going in powers of @xmath98 .",
    "such corrections do not correspond to any physical operators in ope of @xmath6 . from the point of view of confining qft with conformal symmetry explicitly broken by the beta function",
    "we do not see any problem with analytic terms like these . in the limit of @xmath49 these terms decay as negative powers of @xmath48 , but after the summation of @xmath0 perturbation expansion ( see below ) these terms may stay finite .",
    "it is most convenient to study the running coupling constant with dimensional regularization scheme . in that regularization ,",
    "the t hooft coupling constant @xmath99 has dimension of @xmath100 where ( in our notations ) @xmath101 .",
    "the 2-point function expands in power series in @xmath102 with coefficients being some functions of @xmath103 times powers of momentum as dictated by dimensional counting . ignoring spins ,",
    "we have@xmath104    the term @xmath105 represents the sum of @xmath106loop planar diagrams for the 2-point function .",
    "this corresponds to mellin transform @xmath70 being a simple sum of pole terms@xmath107    which correspond to @xmath108 in above equations .",
    "the equation for denominator becomes@xmath109    we can write down recurrent equations for expansion coefficients of @xmath83 in powers of the t hooft bare coupling.@xmath110    the expansion for the masses around the roots @xmath111 of bessel function can be done by iterating equation@xmath112    note that ( as it should have happened ) the overall normalization of @xmath27 corresponding to multiplicative renormalization constants of the operators , dropped in our equation for the denominator . in particular , the one loop term @xmath113 had the pole at @xmath114 related to the logarithmic divergence of the one loop integral in @xmath115 dimensions .",
    "now this pole enters denominator , so that , in effect , we have an extra factor of @xmath103 in the numerator .",
    "this cancels the pole at @xmath114 , coming from the kernel @xmath116 .",
    "namely , there is the factor @xmath117 in denominator .",
    "now this pole at @xmath114 is compensated by @xmath113 .",
    "so , the counting of @xmath118poles remains the same as in momentum space , though , of course extra zeroth and positive powers of @xmath103 coming from the kernel , change the resulting finite terms .    as we learned in the seventies from the famous t hooft s work , in order for the observables to remain finite in the limit of @xmath114",
    "all we need to do is to renormalize the bare coupling@xmath119    the physical coupling @xmath120 corresponds to space scale @xmath48 and is supposed to remain finite at @xmath114 .",
    "for that , the coefficients @xmath121 must have some poles , which are designed to cancel the multiple poles in laurent expansion of coefficient functions @xmath122 , after some other multiplicative renormalization of @xmath27 .",
    "the existence of such universal functions @xmath121 that cancel poles in all 2-point functions is called renormalizability .",
    "we take this for granted here . the uv regularization , dimensional or otherwise should not be affected by the ir regularization such as ours .",
    "moreover , we assume these functions known .",
    "every multi - loop calculation of the ym theory by necessity produces these functions , and also the similar non - universal functions in the renormalization constants for the gauge invariant operators .",
    "naturally , we choose our parameter @xmath48 as a mass scale .",
    "this will produce , after expansion of all the powers of @xmath19 and cancellation of the poles in @xmath103 in every order in @xmath120 some linear combination of powers of @xmath123 in the momentum function @xmath124    as for the expansion of our denominator @xmath32 , it will produce some universal numbers for expansion coefficients @xmath125 when re - expanded in running coupling @xmath120 .",
    "the powers of @xmath48 will all cancel , as we have chosen @xmath48 as our physical scale in the definition of the running coupling constant .",
    "this follows now from trivial dimensional counting : there are no dimensional parameters left .",
    "let us see how this expansion starts in the lowest order .",
    "we take the first approximation , by multiplying @xmath126 by @xmath127 .",
    "we get the following calculable sum    @xmath128    at integer @xmath129@xmath130    comparing this with@xmath131    we see that the first term in @xmath132 leads to overall renormalization , but the second term , being combined with the same term in @xmath133 is equivalent to effect of anomalous dimension@xmath134    therefore , the masses to the first order are given by the roots of @xmath135 .",
    "this is , of course , to be expected : the second loop adds one more logarithm with @xmath136 in front .",
    "this is equivalent to anomalous dimension to this order .",
    "the running coupling constant displays itself in the next loop .",
    "the nontrivial fact is that we derived this from the pad equations , not from the conventional techniques of summing up logarithms .",
    "higher terms are straightforward to generate , though i do not know whether higher order sums would be analytically calculable , like in the first order .",
    "these higher order terms involve some hypergeometric sums , which can be expanded in powers of @xmath103 producing higher polygamma functions @xmath137 .",
    "the good news , however , is the convergence factor we see in this perturbation expansion . at large @xmath138",
    "our factors decrease , at least they do so at any finite @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath139    the problem of growth of planar graphs of high order ( so called renormalons ) was not specific to four dimensions : at any finite @xmath103 t hooft analytic argument would work as well .",
    "this argument does not apply to pad regularization , precisely because it restores correct analytic properties of 2-point function .",
    "the t hooft s condensing singularities in complex @xmath102 plane correspond to these same poles we have here , but old perturbation expansion did not have .",
    "nothing negative can be said about positions of these poles from the point of view of analyticity : the renormalon argument loses its ground .    another important comment . with the dimensional regularization scheme we adopted here , there is no need to separate effects of multiplicative and additive renormalizations .",
    "the 2-point function of composite fields has both of these effects , as it is clear already in the leading order .",
    "there is a logarithmic term , and logarithm transforms additively under rescaling of the momentum cutoff .",
    "therefore , the cs equations should be used with some care .",
    "these equations do not apply to the 2-point function in momentum space , but rather to coordinate space at non - coinsiding points .",
    "the ill - determined subtraction polynomials in momentum , which reflect the additive renormalization , drop after fourier transformation .",
    "another , more honest alternative would be to write the cz equations for the discontinuity of the 2-point function across the cut at positive @xmath19 .",
    "this also eliminates all the additive renormalizations .",
    "discontinuity of the logarithm , for example , is equal to @xmath140 and does not change with rescaling of the cutoff .    but",
    "in dimensional regularization there are no additive renormalizations to begin with .",
    "every loop produces just a power of momentum with well defined coefficient in front .",
    "this leads to great simplifications in meromorphization .",
    "as we have seen above , these power terms are directly translated into calculable terms in our pad equations . with powers of logarithms , one would have to represent those as derivatives of powers to compute , which would lead us back to dimensional regularization .",
    "let us now discuss the confinement condition , which arises in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "according to the previous papers @xcite taking this limit of mass spectrum is equivalent to its minimization over @xmath48 in view of monotonic decrease of masses as functions of pad order .",
    "one can write each mass as follows ( in convenient logarithmic scale , in units of qcd mass squared scale @xmath141):@xmath142    where @xmath120 is the running coupling , satisfying the rg flow equation ( negative sign because of space scale @xmath48 instead of mass scale)@xmath143    and @xmath144 is given by our regularized perturbation expansion , starting with constant:@xmath145    in order to compute these terms of expansion , one has to perturb the bessel solution for @xmath77 by higher terms as explained in the previous section .",
    "also , one should expand the anomalous dimensions , entering the indexes of the bessel functions , in power series in @xmath120 . combining all these perturbations",
    ", we get the higher terms of expansion ( [ regperturbation ] ) .    replacing the limit @xmath49 by the extremum condition ( valid for our monotonous function ! )",
    "we get@xmath146    in order to make this limit non - singular we introduce lagrange multiplier @xmath0 as follows is called legendre transformation .",
    "it is well defined provided the extremum equation @xmath147 has only one solution , which is our case .",
    "once this is true , there are several nice properties of legendre transform .",
    "in particular , as the value of the function at its extremum does not depend upon the choice of the variable , the function @xmath148 is invariant with respect to the change of initial variable @xmath149 .",
    "in particular , this means invariance with respect to renormalization scheme .",
    "another useful feature is the equation for derivative of @xmath148 : @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the position of extremum.the other terms in derivative @xmath152 are identicaly zero due to the extremum condition . in our case@xmath153 and we can either use @xmath154 as independent variable @xmath155 , in which case @xmath156 and @xmath157 , or else we can use @xmath158 , in which case @xmath159 and@xmath160 results are independent of the choice of variable . ]",
    "@xmath161    before we start working with this modified equation let us discuss in some detail the crucial point of monotonous  decrease of masses with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath56 it follows from the pad theorems .",
    "however , at @xmath162 this is no longer true . in case of confinement",
    "the function @xmath144 must grow at large @xmath48 precisely as @xmath163 to cancel the first term .",
    "in other words , in case of confinement we have not only the inequality@xmath164 which reflects monotonous decrease with @xmath48 of original mass @xmath165 in ( [ massoriginal ] ) , but we rather have an equality@xmath166 this means , by continuity , that at least at large enough @xmath48 @xmath167 so that the minimum is unique .",
    "we can not prove this positivity condition for all @xmath48 but we can prove that it holds in the opposite asymptotically free region of large negative @xmath154 . in this region",
    "the masses are roots of bessel functions @xmath168 , with index @xmath80 being anomalous dimension of the operator ( up to @xmath169 corrections ) .",
    "so , we have@xmath170 the derivatives of roots of bessel function with respect to its index at zero index are known to be positive , and so is @xmath171 .",
    "the anomalous dimensions for some non - conserved currents are positive in the first order , so that @xmath172 .",
    "we can choose which root we take as a definition of our transformation from @xmath48 to @xmath0 .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 is universal , so we can express it in terms of @xmath0 from the lowest scalar mass ( @xmath172 in that case ) . then we take ratios of @xmath173 and re - expand the @xmath120 expansion in series in @xmath174    as a result , we see that @xmath175 is positive in asymptotically free region as well as in the confinement region .",
    "one could imagine some pathological behavior with this derivative changing sign two times along the way from asymptotic freedom to the confinement region .",
    "in that case , there may be several branches of the solution for @xmath120 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the best we can do is to compute the perturbative branch , available to us , as a series in @xmath0 and check whether there are some phase transitions on the way from @xmath176 to @xmath56 by estimating the radius of convergence .",
    "let us now dwell on the minimality condition , which can be rewritten in terms of effective coupling @xmath120    and the equation for the logarithm of mass which can be rewritten as follows@xmath177@xmath178   _ { \\alpha=1},\\label{betaeq}\\ ] ]    in order to eliminate the unphysical variable @xmath120 we must expand it in power series in @xmath0 by inverting ( [ minimumeq ] ) and substitute into ( [ betaeq ] ) . with the now popular choice of beta function , suggested in the seventies ( @xcite , formula ( 1))@xmath179    we have @xmath180   _ { \\alpha=1}.\\ ] ]    it is important to note that after taking minimum with respect to @xmath48 , already at arbitrary @xmath162 the dimensional transmutation took place .",
    "the ir cutoff @xmath48 disappeared , so that the mass has the correct qcd scale times some function of dimensionless parameter @xmath0@xmath181 these equations provide the basis for systematic expansion of @xmath182 using the perturbative expansions for @xmath183 and @xmath184 . the effective coupling starts linearly with @xmath0@xmath185 after that , the dimensionless rations @xmath173 can be expanded in @xmath0 , starting with ratios of roots of bessel functions @xmath186@xmath187 since @xmath0 starts linearly in @xmath102 we may view this @xmath0 as a physical running coupling constant .",
