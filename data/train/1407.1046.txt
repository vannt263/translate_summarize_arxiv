    "<S> we prove numerically and by dualities the existence of modulated , commensurate and incommensurate states of topological quantum matter in simple systems of parafermions , motivated by recent proposals for the realization of such systems in mesoscopic arrays . in two space dimensions , </S>",

    "<S> , most efforts directed at investigating topological quantum matter experimentally have taken a top - to - bottom approach , starting from model hamiltonians and engineering a systems to realize it . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> , mesoscopic superconducting arrays have already been proven successful @xcite , and also for cold atomic gases the implementation of topological phases of matter seems within reach @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> inevitably , the model hamiltonians in question can only be realized up to implementation - dependent modifications , that , although small , may be relevant in the sense of the renormalization group and drive large systems away from the intended topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> this practical aspect of the theory of phase transitions for topological quantum matter is the natural counterpart of analogous considerations for conventional systems like magnetic memories , which can only tolerate some range of temperatures and applied magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> however there is one crucial difference . since a landau theory of _ non - local _ order parameters , which are those appropriate to topological quantum matter , </S>",
    "<S> does not exist yet , it is difficult to predict and classify interacting topological gapless phases . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the classification of gapped phases is understood ( for parafermions , see @xcite ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend the list of demonstrated topological critical behaviors ( see , for example , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that topological quantum matter can be driven into phases characterized by non - local orders incommensurate with the underlying lattice . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , it will become clear that modulated and floating ( and , in particular , incommensurate ) topological quantum orders can easily arise in mesoscopic arrays from very natural interactions . and we will prove the existence of a topological universality class surprisingly sensitive to an underlying lattice structure by locating a topological lifshitz tricritical point in the phase diagram of a two - dimensional model of topological quantum matter .    but let us recall first the basics of modulated landau orders . when a _ </S>",
    "<S> local _ order parameter @xmath0 emerges in a lattice system , phases may occur in which this order parameter displays modulations @xmath1 commensurate with the lattice periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> the wave vector @xmath2 is restricted by the lifshitz condition to take one of a few possible values in the first brillouin zone @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this picture of modulated local orders can break down if interactions that favor competing periodicities are present , as exemplified by the annni model @xcite of magnetic ordering in the heavy lanthanoids @xcite . in systems with such competing interactions , there might be regimes where the equilibrium wave vector varies continuously with some driving force , as first predicted in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite from the landau functional density @xmath3 for an ising order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> just as the standard ising tricritical point emerges at @xmath4 , the lifshitz tricritical point emerges at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is the coexistence point for the paramagnetic , ferromagnetic , and modulated phases of the local order parameter @xmath6 . on the coexistence line between the modulated and paramagnetic phases , starting at the lifshitz point , the wave vector @xmath7 varies continuously with the driving field and so an additional critical exponent appears . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath7 happens to vary continuously in a phase , then the phase is called floating .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate through explicit examples that the full range of phenomena associated with commensurate and incommensurate modulations and the lifshitz point can also be present in topological quantum matter , but now in terms of non - local order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the situation for local ( landau ) orders just discussed , there is no obvious way to predict such topological quantum orders on the basis of some general landau - wilson functional . </S>",
    "<S> this point showcases one of the troubling limitations in our current understanding of topological quantum matter at criticality .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by considering a one - dimensional effective hamiltonian with a discrete global @xmath8 ( @xmath9 odd ) symmetry that displays a critical floating phase . </S>",
    "<S> one may obtain a @xmath8 symmetry in systems with quasiparticles of fractional charge @xmath10 subjected to proximity - induced superconducting pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these two ingredients provides a channel for cooper pairs to split into @xmath11 indistinguishable parts . </S>",
    "<S> then the condensation of the cooper pairs leads to a peculiar cyclic behavior of the local , charged degrees of freedom and induces the required @xmath8 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> these ideas are central to several proposals @xcite that aim to realize localized parafermionic zero - energy modes ( parafermions for short ) in hybrid mesoscopic arrays including fractional topological insulators ( fti ) . </S>",
    "<S> parafermions are obtained by gapping the edge modes of a fti and constitute a fractionalized version of majorana zero - energy edge modes ( majoranas for short ) , allowing for the emergence of 1d systems which generalize @xcite the well - known majorana - kitaev chain @xcite .    along the edge of an fti , </S>",

    "<S> two main physical processes intervene to couple the zero - energy modes : a fractional josephson effect @xcite , which generalizes the electron tunneling mediated by majorana modes @xcite , and the charging interactions of the islands which , just like in the majorana case @xcite , cause an energy splitting of the states with different fractional charges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson interaction accounts for the tunneling of fractional quasiparticles between two neighboring islands and it changes their fermionic number by @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling of a single fractional charge is the dominant process and , in terms of parafermionic modes , it reads @xmath21 the charging interactions are modelled by assuming that each island is coupled to a background superconductor by a strong normal josephson junction and a capacitive contact , with magnitudes @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the low energy physics can be described by semiclassically assuming that the superconducting phase of the island is approximately pinned to the minima of the josephson energy . then the charging energy causes an effective interaction @xmath28 , where @xmath29 depends on the ratio @xmath30 @xcite , and the cosine dependence is due to the aharonov - casher effect associated with @xmath31-phase slips in states with different charges @xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
