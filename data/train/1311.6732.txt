    "biological data sets are growing enormously , leading to an information - driven science @xcite and allowing previously impossible breakthroughs .",
    "however , there is now an increasing constraint in identifying relevant characteristics among these large data sets .",
    "for example , in medicine , the identification of features that characterize control and disease subjects is key for the development of diagnostic procedures , prognosis and therapy @xcite . among several exploratory methods ,",
    "the study of clustering structures is a very appealing candidate method , mainly because several biological questions can be formalized in the form : are the features of populations a and b equally clustered ?",
    "one typical example occurs in neuroscience .",
    "it is believed that the brain is organized in clusters of neurons with different major functionalities , and deviations from the typical clustering pattern can lead to a pathological condition @xcite .",
    "another example is in molecular biology , where the gene expression clustering structures depend on the analyzed population ( control or tumor , for instance ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to better understand diseases , it is necessary to differentiate the clustering structures among different populations .",
    "this leads to the problem of how to statistically test the equality of clustering structures of two or more populations followed by the identification of features that are clustered in a different manner .",
    "the traditional approach is to compare some descriptive statistics of the clustering structure ( number of clusters , common elements in the clusters , etc ) @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge , little or nothing is known regarding formal statistical methods to test the equality of clustering structures among populations . with this motivation , we introduce a new statistical test called anocva - analysis of cluster structure variability - in order to statistically compare the clustering structures of two or more populations .",
    "our method is an extension of two well established ideas : the silhouette statistic @xcite and anova .",
    "essentially , we use the silhouette statistic to measure the  variability \" of the clustering structure in each population .",
    "next , we compare the silhouette among populations . the intuitive idea behind",
    "this approach is that we assume that populations with the same clustering structures also have the same `` variability '' .",
    "this simple idea allows us to obtain a powerful statistic test for equality of clustering structures , which ( 1 ) can be applied to a large variety of clustering algorithms ; ( 2 ) allows us to compare the clustering structure of multiple groups simultaneously ; ( 3 ) is fast and easy to implement ; and ( 4 ) identifies features that significantly contribute to the differential clustering .",
    "we illustrate the performance of anocva through simulation studies under different realistic scenarios and demonstrate the power of the test in identifying small differences in clustering among populations .",
    "we also applied our method to study the whole brain functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) recordings of 759 children with typical development ( td ) , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) with hyperactivity / impulsivity and inattentiveness , and adhd with hyperactivity / impulsivity without inattentiveness .",
    "adhd is a psychiatric disorder that usually begins in childhood and often persists into adulthood , affecting at least 5 - 10% of children in the us and non - us populations @xcite .",
    "given its prevalence , impacts on the children s social life , and the difficult diagnosis , a better understanding of its pathology is fundamental .",
    "the statistical analysis using anocva on this large fmri data set composed of adhd and subjects with td identified brain regions that are consistent with already known literature of this physiopathology .",
    "moreover , we have also identified some brain regions previously not described as associated with this disorder , generating new hypothesis to be tested empirically .",
    "we can describe our problem in the following way . given @xmath0 populations @xmath1 where each population @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , is composed of @xmath4 subjects , and each subject has @xmath5 items that are clustered in some manner",
    ", we would like to verify whether the cluster structures of the @xmath0 populations are equal and , if not , which items are differently clustered . to further formalize our method , we must define what we mean by cluster structure .",
    "the silhouette statistic is used in our proposal to identify the cluster structure .",
    "we briefly describe it in the next section .",
    "the silhouette method was proposed in 1987 by @xcite with the purpose of verifying whether a specific item was assigned to an appropriate cluster . in other words ,",
    "the silhouette statistic is a measure of goodness - of - fit of the clustering procedure .",
    "let @xmath6 be the items of one subject that are clustered into @xmath7 clusters by a clustering algorithm according to an optimal criterion .",
    "note that @xmath8 .",
    "denote by @xmath9 the dissimilarity ( e.g. euclidian , manhattan , etc ) between items @xmath10 and @xmath11 and define @xmath12 as the average dissimilarity of @xmath10 to all items of cluster @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) , where @xmath15 is the number of items of @xmath16 .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the cluster to which @xmath18 has been assigned by the clustering algorithm and by @xmath19 any other cluster different of @xmath20 , for all @xmath21 .",
    "all quantities involved in the silhouette statistic are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the `` within '' dissimilarity and @xmath24 is the smallest `` between '' dissimilarity for the sample unit @xmath18 .",
    "then a natural proposal to measure how well item @xmath25 has been clustered is given by the silhouette statistic@xcite",
    "@xmath26    the choice of the silhouette statistic is interesting due to its interpretations .",
    "notice that , if @xmath27 , this implies that the `` within '' dissimilarity is much smaller than the smallest `` between '' dissimilarity ( @xmath28 ) . in other words , item @xmath18 has been assigned to an appropriate cluster since the second - best choice cluster is not nearly as close as the actual cluster . if @xmath29 , then @xmath30 , hence it is not clear whether @xmath18 should have been assigned to the actual cluster or to the second - best choice cluster because it lies equally far away from both . if @xmath31 , then @xmath32 , so item @xmath18 lies much closer to the second - best choice cluster than to the actual cluster .",
    "therefore it is more natural to assign item @xmath18 to the second - best choice cluster instead of the actual cluster because this item @xmath18 has been `` misclassified '' . to conclude , @xmath33 measures how well item @xmath18 has been labeled .",
    "let @xmath34 be the @xmath35-matrix of dissimilarities , then it is symmetric and has zero diagonal elements .",
    "let @xmath36 be the labels obtained by a clustering algorithm applied to the dissimilarity matrix @xmath37 , i.e. , the labels represent the cluster each item belongs to .",
    "it can be easily verified that the dissimilarity matrix @xmath37 and the vector of labels @xmath38 are sufficient to compute the quantities @xmath39 . in order to avoid notational confusions ,",
    "we will write @xmath40 rather than @xmath41 for all @xmath21 , because we deal with many data sets in the next section .      in the previous section , we introduced notations when we have @xmath5 items in one subject . in the present section , we extend the approach to many populations and many subjects in each population .",
    "let @xmath42 be @xmath0 types of populations . for the @xmath43th population ,",
    "@xmath44 subjects are collected , for @xmath45 . in order to establish notations , the items of the @xmath46th",
    "subject taken from the @xmath43th population are represented by the matrix @xmath47 where each item @xmath48 @xmath49 is a vector .",
    "first we define the matrix of dissimilarities among items of each matrix @xmath50 , by @xmath51    notice that each @xmath52 is symmetric with diagonal elements equal zero . also , we define the following average matrices of dissimilarities @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 . the ( @xmath56)-matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the only quantities required for proceeding with our proposal .    now , based on the matrix of dissimilarities @xmath59",
    "we can use a clustering algorithm to find the clustering labels @xmath60 .",
    "then , we compute the following silhouette statistics @xmath61    the former is the silhouette statistic based on the matrix of dissimilarities @xmath58 and the latter is the silhouette statistic based on the dissimilarity matrix @xmath62 , both obtained by using the clustering labels computed via the matrix @xmath58 .",
    "we expect that if the items from all populations @xmath63 are equally clustered , the quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 must be close for all @xmath66 and @xmath21 .",

    "briefly , the steps of the pipeline are as follows : exclusion of the first four scans ; slice timing correction ; deoblique dataset ; correction for head motion ; masking the volumes to discard non - brain voxels ; co - registration of mean image to the respective anatomic image of the children ; spatial normalization to mni space ( resampling to 4 mm @xmath114 4 mm @xmath114 4 mm resolution ) ; removing effects of wm , csf , head motion ( 6 parameters ) and linear trend using linear multiple regression ; temporal band - pass filter ( 0.009 @xmath115 f @xmath115 0.08 hz ) ; spatial smoothing using a gaussian filter ( fwhm = 6 mm ) . the cc400 atlas ( based on the approach described in craddock _ et al_. , ( 2012)@xcite ) provided by the neurobureau was used to define the 351 regions - of - interest ( rois ) used in this study .",
    "the average signal of each roi was calculated and used as representative of the region .    for each child",
    ", a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating the spearman s correlation coefficient ( which is robust against outliers and suitable to identify monotonic non - linear relationships ) among the 351 rois ( items ) in order to identify monotonically dependent rois .",
    "then , the correlations matrices were corrected for site - effects by using a general linear model .",
    "site effects were modeled as a glm ( site as a categorical variable ) and the effect was removed by considering the residuals of this model .",
    "p - values corresponding to the spearman s correlation for each pair of rois were calculated .",
    "then , the obtained p - values were corrected by false discovery rate ( fdr ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the dissimilarity matrices @xmath116 for @xmath117 are symmetric with diagonal elements equal zero and non - diagonal elements ranging from zero to one .",
    "the higher the correlation , the lower the p - value , and consequently , the lower the dissimilarity between two rois .",
    "notice that the p - value associated to each spearman s correlation is not used as a statistical test , but only as a measure of dissimilarity normalized by the variance of the rois .",
    "the choice of the proposed dissimilarity measure instead of the standard one minus the correlation coefficient is due to the fact that we are interested in rois that are highly correlated , independent whether they present positive or negative correlation . here , we are interested in calculating how much rois are dependent ( the dissimilarity among them ) and not how they are correlated .",
    "for each scenario and each value of @xmath112 ( @xmath118 ) , @xmath119 monte carlo realizations were constructed and tested by our approach .",
    "the results obtained by simulations are illustrated in figure [ fig : roc ] , which describes the proportion of rejected null hypotheses for each p - value threshold ( significance level ) . under the null hypothesis ( scenario ( i ) ) ,",
    "figure [ fig : roc]a shows that the test is actually controlling the rate of type i error , i.e. , the proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses is the expected by the p - value threshold . since the uniform distribution for p - values implies that the distribution of the statistic is correctly specified under the null hypothesis , the kolmogorov - smirnov test was applied to compare the p - values distribution with a uniform distribution .",
    "the test under the null hypothesis presented a p - value of 0.14 , meaning that there is no statistical evidence to affirm that the monte carlo p - value distribution is not a uniform distribution .    in the case",
    "that there is no mixture of populations ( @xmath120 ) and under the alternative hypothesis , i.e. , scenarios ( ii ) , ( iii ) , and ( iv ) , the test identified 100% of the times ( at a p - value threshold of 0.05 ) , the differences in the clustering structures ( figure [ fig : roc ] , panels ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) ) .",
    "as the coefficient @xmath112 of mixture level increases , the power of the test decreases , and , as expected , when the mixture level is 50% ( @xmath121 ) , the method is not able to identify any difference between populations ( at a p - value threshold of 0.05 ) .",
    "moreover , by comparing the different scenarios under the same @xmath112 , it is possible to verify that the power of the test is higher in scenario ( iv ) , where the number of clusters changes ( figure [ fig : roc]d ) , followed by scenario ( iii ) , which represents a `` swap '' of items between clusters ( figure [ fig : roc]c ) and finally by the case ( scenario ( ii ) ) that one item `` jumps '' from one cluster to another ( figure [ fig : roc]b ) .",
    "these results are in accordance to the intuitive notion that the power of the test is proportional to the number of items that are clustered in a different manner between populations .",
    "the greater the number of items clustered in a different manner , the higher the power of the test to discriminate it .",
    "30% ) of mixture , the number of truly rejected null hypotheses is high , while for higher rates of mixture ( @xmath12240% ) , the statistical test does not reject the null hypothesis.,width=528 ]    figure [ fig : z - score ] depicts an illustrative example of one realization of each scenario with @xmath120 in order to show that the method indeed identifies the items that are contributing to the differential clustering among different populations .",
    "the x - axis represents the items from 1 to 100 .",
    "the y - axis represents the z - scores of the p - values corrected for multiple comparisons by the false discovery rate ( fdr ) method @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : z - score ] , panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , represent the items and the respective z - scores that contribute significantly to the differential clustering in scenarios ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) , and ( iv ) , respectively .",
    "items with z - score higher than 1.96 represent the statistically significant ones at a p - value threshold of 0.05 .",
    "notice that , as expected , figure [ fig : z - score]a does not present any items as statistically significant because scenario ( i ) was constructed under the null hypothesis .",
    "figure [ fig : z - score]b highlights the 20th item as statistically significant , which is exactly the item that `` jumped '' from one cluster to another . figure [ fig : z - score]c shows that items 1 and 21 are statistically significant .",
    "items 1 and 21 are the ones that were `` switched '' in our simulations . figure [ fig : z - score]d illustrates a concentration of high z - scores between items 60 and 100 , representing the items that were merged into one cluster in population @xmath101 of scenario ( iv ) .",
    "therefore , by analyzing the statistic @xmath75 for @xmath73 , it is also possible to identify which item is contributing to the differential clustering among populations , i.e. , which item is clustered in a different manner among populations .",
    "another point to be analyzed is that , in practice , the number of clusters should be estimated .",
    "the problem is that there is no consensus in the literature regarding this problem . in other words ,",
    "different methods may estimate different number of clusters for the same data set due to the lack of definition of a cluster ( a cluster is usually a result obtained by a clustering algorithm ) .",
    "then , we also analyzed how sensitive is the power of anocva regarding the estimated number of clusters . in order to illustrate it ,",
    "two further simulations were carried out .",
    "first , the control of the rate of false positives in scenario ( i ) was verified by varying the number of clusters from three to seven .",
    "the number of repetitions was set to 1000 .",
    "notice that the correct number of clusters of @xmath58 is five .",
    "figure [ fig : k - estimation]a shows that the rate of rejected null hypothesis is proportional to the expected by the p - value threshold for number of clusters varying from three to seven .",
    "this result suggests that for numbers of clusters close to the `` correct '' one , the test is able to control the type i error under the null hypothesis .",
    "now , it is necessary to verify the power of the test under the alternative hypothesis with different number of clusters . the simulation to evaluate it",
    "is composed of two populations ( @xmath99 ) .",

    "these @xmath123 items are generated by normal distributions with unit variance in the following manner .",
    "for population @xmath103 , items ( @xmath124 ) , ( @xmath125 ) , ( @xmath126 ) , and ( @xmath127 ) ( for @xmath97 ) are centered at positions ( 2 , 0 ) , ( 0 , -2 ) , ( -2 , 0 ) , and ( 0 , 2 ) , respectively . for population @xmath101 ,",

    "the number of repetitions and the mixture tuning variable @xmath112 are set to 1000 and 0.3 , respectively .",
    "this simulation describes the scenario that the number of clusters for the matrix of dissimilarities @xmath58 is clearly four .",
    "figure [ fig : k - estimation]b shows that the power of the test is optimum when the correct number of clusters is used .",
    "thus , these results suggest that the method is still able to reject the null hypothesis with a considerable power under the alternative hypothesis for number of clusters close to the `` correct '' number .",
    "therefore , the choice of an objective criterion to determine the number of clusters does not change significantly the results .",
    "we do not enter in further discussions regarding the estimation of the number of clusters because it is not the scope of this work . for a good review regarding the estimation of the number of clusters , refer to milligan and cooper ( 1985 ) @xcite .",
    "sometimes , populations are not balanced in their respective sizes and consequently , the largest population may dominate the average , and the clustering algorithm may bias the assignment . in order to study the performance of anocva in not well balanced populations , we performed the simulation described in scenario 2 with populations varying in proportions of 1:9 , 2:8 , 3:7 , and 4:6 in a total of 40 subjects .",
    "power curves are shown in figure [ fig : balance ] .",
    "one thousand repetitions were done for each analyzed proportion . by analyzing figure [ fig : balance ] ,",
    "one may notice that the power of the test is high when populations are closer to 5:5 and is low when they are not balanced .",
    "in other words , the more balanced are the populations , the higher is the power of the test .",
    "besides , even when data is poorly balanced ( 1:9 ) , the area under the curve is greater than 0.5 .",
    "another point is the definition of what a cluster is .",
    "since the definition of a cluster depends on the problem of interest - clusters are usually determined as the result of the application of a clustering algorithm ( for example , k - means , hierarchical clustering , spectral clustering , etc ) - it is natural that the results obtained by anocva may change in function of the clustering procedure and the chosen metric ( for example , euclidean , manhattan , etc ) .",
    "thus , the selection of both clustering algorithm and metric depends essentially on the type of data , what is clustered , and the hypothesis to be tested .",
    "anocva was applied to the adhd data set , in order to identify rois associated with the disease .",
    "since we are interested in identifying rois that are differentially clustered in terms of their connectivity , the clustering algorithm used to determine the labels based on the dissimilarity matrix @xmath58 was the unnormalized spectral clustering algorithm @xcite .",
    "for details of the implemented spectral clustering algorithm , refer to the appendix .",
    "the number of clusters was determined by using the silhouette method @xcite .",
    "the number of bootstrap samples was set to 1000 .",
    "the group of children with hyperactive / impulsive adhd was excluded from our analysis due to the low number of subjects ( 11 children ) .",
    "the performed tests and the respective p - values corrected for multiple comparisons by the bonferroni method are listed at table [ table : adhd ] .",
    "first , the test was applied to the entire data set ( excluded the group of hyperactive / impulsive adhd due to the low number of subjects ) in order to verify if there is at least one population that differs from the others .",
    "the test indicated a significant difference ( p - value=0.020 ) , suggesting that there is at least one population that presents a different clustering structure . in order to identify which populations present different clustering structures ,",
    "pairwise comparisons among the groups were carried out . by observing table [ table : adhd ] ,",
    "it is not possible to verify significant differences between td versus inattentive adhd ( p - value = 0.700 ) , and combined adhd versus inattentive adhd ( p - value = 0.615 ) , but there are significant differences between td versus combined and inattentive adhd ( p - value @xmath115 0.001 ) , and td versus combined adhd ( p - value @xmath115 0.001 ) .",
    "these results indicate that the significant differences obtained for td , combined adhd and inattentive adhd were probably due to the differences between td and combined adhd .",
    ".anocva applied to the adhd data set .",
    "the number of bootstrap samples is set to 1000 .",

    "rois of both populations were clustered by spectral clustering algorithm , and the numbers of clusters for each group were estimated by the silhouette method .",
    "the silhouette method estimates the optimum number of clusters by selecting the number of clusters associated with the highest silhouette width . by analyzing figure [ fig : silhouette ]",

    "notice that the silhouette width for one cluster is not defined .",
    "the maximum silhouette width is obtained when the number of clusters is four for both cases .",
    "these results suggest that the number of clusters in both data sets is four.,width=528 ]    the results of the clustering procedure are visualized in figure [ fig : brain ] , where panels ( a ) and ( b ) represent children with td and children with combined adhd , respectively .     and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "the number of clusters was estimated by the silhouette method .",
    "panel ( c ) highlights the rois that are clustered in a different manner between children with td and adhd .",
    "regions highlighted in white represent high z - scores while regions in red represent lower z - scores .",
    "the z - scores were calculated by using the p - values obtained by anocva after fdr correction for multiple comparisons.,width=528 ]    interestingly , the clusters were composed of anatomically contiguous and almost symmetric areas of the brain , although these constraints were not included _ a priori _ in our analyses .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that the spectral clustering method groups areas with similar brain activities in the same cluster .",
    "then , each roi was tested in order to identify the one that significantly contribute to the difference in clustering between children with td and with combined adhd .",
    "p - values were corrected for multiple comparisons by the fdr method , and then , converted to z - scores .",
    "figure [ fig : brain]c illustrates the statistically significant rois at a p - value threshold of 0.05 after fdr correction .",
    "the regions highlighted in white are the rois with the highest z - scores , while the regions highlighted in red represent rois with lower z - scores , but still statistically significant .    by comparing figure [ fig : brain ]",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) , it is possible to verify that the highlighted regions in figure [ fig : brain]c correspond to rois that are clustered in a different manner between children with td and with combined adhd .    cluster analysis has suggested a very similar network organization between children with td and combined adhd patients .",
    "apparently , sensory - motor systems , frontoparietal control networks , visual processing and fronto - temporal systems are similarly distributed between the two groups",
    ". however , the application of anocva unveiled that anterior portion of inferior , middle and superior frontal gyri , inferior temporal gyrus , angular gyrus , and some regions of cerebellum , lateral parietal , medial occipital and somato - motor cortices have a distinct clustering organization between the two populations .    motor system ( pre and postcentral giri and cerebellum ) alterations in adhd are associated to hyperactivity symptoms , and this finding has already been extensively described in the literature ( for a detailed review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , dickstein _",
    "et al_.@xcite carried out a meta - analysis of fmri studies comparing controls and adhd and identified some portions of parietal cortex , inferior prefrontal cortex and primary motor cortex as regions with activation differences between the groups .",
    "the inferior frontal cortex highlighted by anocva is described in literature as a key region for inhibition of responses @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the impulsivity symptoms present in combined adhd can be related to an abnormal participation of this region in the context of global brain network organization , when compared to healthy controls .",
    "this finding is reinforced by the findings of recent studies .",
    "et al_. @xcite investigated the role of this area in therapeutic mechanisms of treatments for adhd .",
    "in addition , vasic _ et al_. @xcite and whelan _ et al_. @xcite explored the neural error signaling in these regions ( in adults ) and the impulsivity of adolescents with adhd .",
    "the inferior frontal cortex is also implied to participate in language production , comprehension , and learning and , therefore , our finding is consistent with the language impairment reported in adhd subjects @xcite .    an interesting finding from the application of the proposed method to the resting state fmri dataset was the identification of angular gyrus as a region with functional abnormalities in adhd in the context of brain networks . although the angular gyrus contributes to the integration of information , playing an important role in many cognitive processes @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , there are very few studies in literature suggesting activation differences in this region when comparing adhd to healthy controls @xcite .",
    "the angular gyrus contributes to the integration of information , and play a role in many cognitive processes @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite have found that this region exhibited less activation in adolescents with adhd during a target detection task .",
    "moreover , simos _",
    "et al_. @xcite have shown that angular and supramargial gyrus play a role in brain mechanisms for reading and its correlates in adhd .",
    "we note that despite the angular gyrus has a crucial role in the integration of information , both studies have not explored the relevance of this region from a network connectivity perspective . using the proposed method , we properly carried out this analysis and the findings indicate that the role of this region in brain spontaneous activity is different , when comparing the two groups .",
    "the existence of temporal and spatial correlation is inherent in fmri data and ignoring intrinsic correlation may lead to misleading or erroneous conclusions .",
    "this dependence structure makes clustering analysis more challenging and should be accounted for @xcite .",
    "notice that the proposed bootstrap incorporates the spatial correlations in the clustering process and also preserves the temporal structure .    in order to certify that both the bootstrap based statistical test is corretly working in actual data and the results obtained in this study are not due to numerical fluctuations or another source of error not took into account , we verified the control of the rate of false positives in biological data .",
    "the set of 479 children with td was split randomly into two subsets , and the clustering test was applied between them .",
    "this procedure was repeated 700 times .",
    "the proportion of falsely rejected null hypothesis for p - values lower than 1 , 5 , and 10% were 2.14% , 5.70% , and 9.83% , respectively , confirming that the type i error is effectively controlled in this biological data set . moreover ,",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test was applied to compare the p - values distribution obtained in the 700 repetitions with the uniform distribution . the kolmogorov - smirnov test indicated a p - value of 0.664 , meaning that there is no statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the p - values distribution obtained in 700 repetitions follows a uniform distribution .",
    "furthermore , we also verified in the same manner whether the highlighted rois are indeed statistically significant .",
    "the proposed method was applied to each roi , i.e. , 351 p - values were calculated in each repetition .",
    "thus , 351 p - values distributions , one for each roi were constructed .",
    "each of the 351 p - values distribution was compared with the uniform distribution by the kolmogorov - smirnov test . after correcting the obtained 351 p - values by the kolmogorov - smirnov test by fdr @xcite",
    ", only two null hypotheses were rejected at a p - value threshold of 0.05 , confirming that the type i error is also controlled for rois .",
    "these results suggest that the differences in clustering between children with td and with combined adhd are indeed statistically significant .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the method proposed here is the first one that statistically identifies differences in the clustering structure of two or more populations of subjects simultaneously .",
    "however , it is important to discuss some limitations of anocva .",
    "first , the method is only defined if the estimated number of clusters for the average of the matrix of dissimilarities @xmath58 is greater than one .",
    "it is due to the fact that the silhouette statistic @xmath135 is only defined when the number of clusters is greater than one . in practice ,",
    "one may test whether each dissimilarity matrix @xmath136 and the average of dissimilarity matrix @xmath58 are composed of one or more clusters by using the gap statistic proposed by tibshirani _",
    "et al_. ( 2002)@xcite .",
    "if @xmath58 is composed of one cluster while one of the matrices of dissimilarities @xmath136 is composed of more than one cluster , clearly the clustering structures among populations are different .",
    "another limitation is the fact that anocva does not identify changes in both rotated and/or translated data . in other words ,",
    "the test does not identify alterations that maintain the relative dissimilarities among items . if one is interested in identifying this kind of difference",
    ", one simple solution is to test the joint mean by the hotteling s t - squared test @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to point out that anocva is sensitive to identify different clustering assignments that have the same goodness of fit ( silhouette ) .",
    "notice that @xcite proposed the use of the average of @xmath41 in order to obtain a goodness of fit .",
    "here , we do not use the average value but the distance between the entire vectors @xmath137 .",
    "in other words , we take into account the label of the items that are clustered . therefore ,",
    "if one or more items are clustered in a different manner among populations , our statistic @xmath74 is able to capture this difference .",
    "however , the use of the average value of @xmath137 is not .",
    "moreover , anocva requires a considerable number of subjects in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis ( when the clustering structures are in fact different ) .",
    "it is very difficult to define a minimum number of subjects because it depends on the variance , but we suppose that an order of dozens ( based on our simulations ) is necessary .",
    "there are other measures for similarity between clustering structures @xcite that might be used to develop a statistical test .",
    "however , these similarity measures can not be extended in a straightforward manner to simultaneously test more than two populations .",
    "the work proposed by @xcite was successfully applied in neuroscience to statistically test differences in network community structures . however , again , this method can not test simultaneously more than two populations .",
    "notice that in our case , we are interested in comparing controls and several sub - groups of adhd simultaneously . therefore , this method is not applicable .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the characteristic of anocva that allows to statistically test whether the structure of the clusters of several populations - not limited to pairwise comparisons - are all equals avoids the increase of committing a type i error due to multiple tests .",
    "furthermore , anocva can be used to test any clustering structure , not limited to network community structures such as the one proposed by @xcite .",
    "another advantage is the use of a bootstrap approach to construct the empirical null hypothesis distribution from the original data .",
    "it allows the application of the test to data sets that the underlying probability distribution is unknown .",
    "moreover , it is also known that for actual data sets , the bootstrap procedure provides better control of the rate of false positives than asymptotic tests @xcite .",
    "one question that remains is , what is the difference between anocva and a test for equality of dissimilarities , for example , a t - test for each distance .",
    "the main difference is that , for a t - test , only the mean and variance of the measure to be tested is taken into account to determine whether two items are `` far '' or `` close '' , while anocva is a data - based metric that uses the clustering structure to determine how `` far '' the items are from others .",
    "furthermore , we also remark that testing whether the data are equally distributed is not the same of testing whether the data are equally clustered , since items may come from very different distributions and be clustered in a quite similar way depending on the clustering algorithm .",
    "one may also ask the difference between an f - test of the clustering coefficient and anocva .",
    "notice that the clustering coefficient is a measure of degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together , while anocva tests whether the structure of the clusters of several populations are all equals .    here ,",
    "the purpose of the test was to identify rois that are associated with adhd , but the same analysis can be extended to other large data sets . specifically in neuroscience , the recent generation of huge amounts of data in collaborative projects , such as the autism brain image data exchange ( abide ) project + ( http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org / indi / abide / index.html ) , which generated fmri data of more than 1000 individuals with autism , the adhd-200 project @xcite previously described here that provides fmri data of @xmath138 children with adhd , the fmri data center , which is a public repository for fmri + ( http://www.fmridc.org/f/fmridc ) @xcite , the alzheimer s disease neuroimaging initiative , which collected magnetic resonance imaging of @xmath139 subjects @xcite , and many others that will certainly be produced due to the decreasing costs in data acquisition , makes cluster analysis techniques indispensable to mine information useful to diagnosis , prognosis and therapy .",
    "the flexibility of our approach that allows the application of the test on several populations simultaneously ( instead of limiting to pairwise comparisons ) , along with its performance demonstrated in both simulations and actual biological data , will make it applicable to many areas where clustering is a source of concern .",
    "spectral clustering refers to a class of techniques which rely on the eigen - structure of a similarity matrix to partition points into clusters with points in the same cluster having high similarity and points in different clusters having low similarity .",
    "the similarity matrix is provided as an input and consists of a quantitative assessment of the relative similarity of each pair of attributes in the data set . in our case ,",
    "the similarity of two rois is given by one minus the p - value obtained by the spearman s correlation between rois .",
    "the spectral clustering algorithm is described as follows @xcite :    * input * : the similarity matrix @xmath140 , where @xmath141 ( consider @xmath142 of the spearman s correlation ) , and the number of clusters @xmath143 .    1 .",

    "<S> , we introduce a novel statistical test called anocva - analysis of cluster structure variability , which statistically tests whether two or more populations are equally clustered using specific features . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method allows us to compare the clustering structure of multiple groups simultaneously , and also to identify features that contribute to the differential clustering . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the performance of anocva through simulations and an application to an fmri data set composed of children with adhd and controls . </S>",
    "<S> results show that there are several differences in the brain s clustering structure between them , corroborating the hypothesis in the literature . furthermore , we identified some brain regions previously not described , generating new hypothesis to be tested empirically .    </S>",
