    "beginning with its first observation in rare gases almost 30 years ago @xcite , high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) has become the foundation for attosecond science through a series of advances at the fundamental as well as the applied level @xcite . since the turn of the millennium",
    ", attosecond pulses produced via gas - phase hhg have become a successful tool for the study of ultrafast dynamics in atoms , molecules , and biological systems @xcite .",
    "the recent observation of hhg from bulk solids , displaying a plateau of harmonics that ends in a high frequency cutoff  @xcite , has generated considerable interest given its potential as both a compact , next generation ultrafast light source in the extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) , as well as the promise of applying hhg spectroscopic techniques to correlated electron dynamics in bulk materials @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for hhg in solids has been intensely debated @xcite , and a conceptual picture of the generation process , augmented by new experimental results  @xcite , is only slowly beginning to emerge . in momentum space ,",
    "the discussion has centered on the relative contributions of inter - band and intra - band processes to the driven non - linear current that gives rise to the harmonic radiation @xcite .",
    "a consensus is forming that while intra - band contributions are important for harmonics with energies below the band gap @xcite , inter - band processes generally dominate the higher harmonics that span the plateau region @xcite .",
    "in real space , vampa and collaborators  @xcite have proposed a three - step semi - classical model in which a localized electron and hole pair are accelerated away from and recollide with each other after traversing many lattice cells , in analogy with the gas - phase three - step model of hhg  @xcite .",
    "while most of the works discussed above have described the strong - field dynamics using only a valence band and the lowest - lying conduction band , recent experimental and theoretical findings indicate another layer of complexity in the hhg generation process : ndabashimiye _ et al . _",
    "@xcite directly compared the harmonics from argon and krypton in their solid phase and their gas phase and found that the solid hhg spectra exhibited multiple plateaus with the highest cutoff energies far exceeding those found in the gas phase for the same laser intensity .",
    "the multiple plateaus and their relative strengths and cutoff energies were reproduced using a multi - level model that takes into account the coupling between the valence band and several conduction bands at the high symmetry ( @xmath0 ) point in solid argon @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explore in detail the multi - level model used in @xcite to calculate the hhg spectrum from a solid interacting with a strong , mid - infrared laser field .",
    "we show that the appearance of multiple plateaus in the harmonic spectrum from such a system can be understood both qualitatively and quantitatively , and we derive predictions for the cutoff energies and the relative strengths of the different plateaus .",
    "we begin by showing that a multi - level system is a natural basis in which to consider harmonic generation in a solid , because when the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) in a periodic system is solved in the velocity gauge the different values of the crystal momentum @xmath1 remain uncoupled even in the presence of a laser field  @xcite .",
    "the band structure of the solid can thus be represented as a collection of independent multi - level systems , and the dynamics in the solid is given by the sum of the dynamics of each @xmath1-value represented in the initial wave function .",
    "here we concentrate on the dynamics that result from the simplest possible initial condition , in which a single bloch state with @xmath2 ( @xmath0 point ) is considered so that the initial electron wave function is maximally delocalized . in @xcite",
    "we showed that this very simple condition reproduces the characteristics of inter- and intra - band contributions to hhg and their relative importance to low and high order harmonics .",
    "we interpret the electron dynamics in the multi - level system in terms of the time - dependent eigenstates of the laser - dressed system , the adiabatic states , and we show how hhg proceeds through a combination of adiabatic and diabatic processes involving the dressed states , similarly to what has been discussed for instance in @xcite .",
    "we use the evolution of the adiabatic states to derive predictions for the cutoff energies and relative strengths of each plateau supported by the multi - level system .    after discussing hhg in multi - level systems",
    ", we show that when the multi - level system is constructed from the energy levels and their transition matrix elements for a periodic potential at @xmath2 , the adiabatic states will recover the full @xmath3 band structure of that solid , if we allow the crystal momentum to increase with the vector potential of the field , similar to what is done in the houston state treatment of reference  @xcite .",
    "this correspondence between the adiabatic states and the band structure leads us to a semi - classical , three - step picture for harmonic generation in a solid , in momentum space . in this picture ,",
    "the delocalized electron first tunnels from the valence band ( vb ) to the conduction band ( cb ) at the zero of the vector potential and is then accelerated on the conduction band as the vector potential increases and decreases through a half optical cycle .",
    "the coherence between the vb and cb populations leads to emission of xuv radiation , with photon energies corresponding to the instantaneous energy difference between the vb and the cb .",
    "this means that every energy below the cutoff energy is emitted twice in each half - cycle .",
    "this picture also allows us to predict that for a 1d multi - band system , the maximum cutoff energy of each plateau will be limited by the maximum band gap between the valence band and the highest - lying conduction band involved in producing that plateau .",
    "this extends the cutoff limitation proposed in @xcite and @xcite for two - band systems to a multi - band system exhibiting multiple plateaus in the harmonic spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : tdsesolid ] we introduce the theoretical framework that the remainder of the paper is based on , namely the solution of the single - active - electron tdse in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) solid interacting with a strong field , and we discuss our initial condition of a delocalized electron wavefunction . in section [ sec : two_level_hhg ] we use the simplest multi - level system  the two - level system  to review the formalism for how to think about hhg in a multi - level system both at the qualitative level , using a three - step picture , and at the quantitative level in terms of predictions for the strength and extent ( cutoff energy ) of the plateau . in section",
    "[ sec : hhg_multi - level_system ] we study hhg in a multi - level system consisting of four or more levels , which , as discussed above , leads to the appearance of multiple plateaus in the harmonic spectrum .",
    "we extend the two - level formulas and derive expressions for the cutoff energies and relative strengths of the different plateaus .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : semiclassical_picture ] we show the connection between the adiabatic states of the dressed multi - level system and the band structure of the model solid and the resulting semi - classical picture of hhg in solids .",

    "this is in particular true in solid argon which we will be using as an example below .",
    "this means that the electron at @xmath2 has the highest excitation probability to the higher conduction bands .",
    "one therefore expects the largest contribution to the highly nonlinear hhg yield to originate at @xmath2 as has indeed been verified in calculations incorporating the 3d band structure @xcite , at moderate intensities .",

    "the energies of the houston states @xmath85 are simply the energies of the bloch states at the crystal momentum that corresponds to the vector potential @xcite : @xmath86 where the constant term comes from the fact that bloch and houston hamiltonians differ by a @xmath87 term ( see @xcite ) .    an important implication of eq .",

    ". a complete proof of this relationship can be found in appendix b.    we note that the agreement between the adiabatic states and the band structure improves with the inclusion of more levels in the multi - level model .",
