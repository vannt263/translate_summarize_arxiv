    "on 9th october 2006 , @xcite reported k. itagaki s discovery of a possible supernova ( sn ) in ugc  4904 .",
    "although the sn was discovered after the peak , an upper limit of the @xmath6 magnitude ( @xmath7 ) was obtained at @xmath820 days before the discovery @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite also reported that an optical transient had appeared in 2004 close to the position of sn  2006jc .",
    "the transient was as faint as @xmath9 and its duration was as short as @xmath10 days . since the event was faint and short - lived , they speculated that the transient was a luminous blue variable ( lbv)-like event .",
    "the spatial coincidence between the lbv - like event and sn  2006jc is confirmed by @xcite . because of such an intriguing association with the lbv - like event , many groups performed follow - up observations of sn  2006jc in various wavebands : x - ray , ultra violet ( uv ) , optical , infrared ( ir ) , and radio .",
    "spectroscopic observations showed many broad features and strong narrow emission lines . according to the he detection , sn  2006jc",
    "was classified as type ib @xcite . however ,",
    "strange spectral features and their evolutions were reported .",
    "a bright blue continuum was prominent in the optical spectrum at early epochs @xcite .",
    "such a bright blue continuum had also been observed in type ii sn  1988z @xcite , but the origin of this feature is still unclear .",
    "as the blue continuum declined , the red wing brightened and the optical spectra showed `` u''-like shapes @xcite .",
    "this is a distinguishing feature of sn  2006jc in contrast to the spectra of usual sne that have a peak in optical bands .",
    "photometric observations in optical and ir bands were performed continuously .",
    "the optical light curve ( lc ) showed a rapid decline from 50 days after the discovery , as in the case of sn  1999cq @xcite . at the same epoch , near infrared ( nir ) emissions brightened @xcite .",
    "the nir brightness increased from @xmath11 days to @xmath12 days after the discovery and then declined @xcite .",
    "the epoch of the nir brightening corresponds to that of the development of the red wing in the optical spectra @xcite .",
    "the nir brightening , as well as the fact that the redder side of the he emission profile declined faster than the bluer side , has been interpreted as an evidence of an ongoing dust formation @xcite . additionally , on 29th april 2007 ( 200 days after the discovery ) , the _ akari _ satellite performed nir and mid - infrared ( mir ) photometric and spectroscopic observations @xcite and the _ magnum _ telescope obtained the nir photometries @xcite .",
    "they report the formation of amorphous carbon dust : another piece of evidences of the dust formation .",
    "x - ray and uv emissions have also been observed by the _ swift _ and _ chandra _ satellites @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations were performed at seven epochs and showed a brightening from @xmath13 days to @xmath14 days after the discovery @xcite .",
    "the x - ray detection suggests an interaction between the sn ejecta and the circumstellar matter ( csm ) . on the contrary",
    ", the radio emission was not detected by very large array ( vla ) @xcite .",
    "we present a sn explosion model of a wolf - rayet star that explains the bolometric and x - ray lcs .",
    "hydrodynamics , nucleosynthesis , and lc synthesis calculations are performed assuming the spherical symmetry . in this study",
    ", we assume the explosion date of sn  2006jc to be 15 days before the discovery ( @xmath15 ) and the energy source of the light to be the @xmath4ni-@xmath4co  decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : bol ] , we describe how we derive the bolometric lc from observations in the various wavebands , in   [ sec : presn ] , we briefly discuss the presupernova evolutionary properties of the progenitor star ; in   [ sec : hyd ] , hydrodynamical and nucleosynthesis calculations are described ; in   [ sec : lc ] , lc synthesis calculations are presented ; in   [ sec : csm ] , we calculate the x - ray emission due to the ejecta - csm interaction ; in   [ sec : conclude ] and   [ sec : discuss ] , conclusions and discussion are presented .",

    "the @xmath150-ray photon and positron emitted from the @xmath4ni-@xmath4co  decay are absorbed by the sn ejecta and the absorbed energy is thermalized .",
    "thus , the spectra would show a blackbody - like continuum as normal type i sne do . however",
    ", the spectra of sn  2006jc do not resemble those of normal type i sne but show a bright blue continuum in early epochs @xcite . in the case of the ejecta - csm interaction , the kinetic energy",
    "is transformed to an x - ray emission via bremsstrahlung radiation , and then converted to uv , optical , and ir emissions .",
    "thus , it is difficult to explain that the x - ray luminosity is much fainter than the optical luminosity unless the optical depth for the x - ray emission is much higher than that for the optical emission .",
    "another problem with the ejecta - csm interaction model is that the x - ray lc is not synchronized with the bolometric lc .",
    "in addition , the lc powered by the ejecta - csm interaction usually has a long - term plateau ( e.g. , sn  1997cy , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we assume that the lc is powered by the @xmath4ni-@xmath4co  decay .",
    "the bolometric lc of sn  2006jc is constructed from the uv , optical , and ir observations as described in ",
    "[ sec : bol ] .",
    "the estimated peak bolometric magnitude of sn  2006jc is @xmath151 , being as bright as sn  2006aj ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the models with @xmath136 , 10 , and 20 can eject a large enough amount of @xmath4ni , while the @xmath4ni  production of the model with @xmath135 is too small .    the spherical explosion models with @xmath136 , 10 , and 20 yield too much @xmath154 because of no fallback . however , no fallback is a consequence of the assumption of the spherical symmetry .",
    "the fallback takes place in an aspherical explosion even with a high explosion energy and thus the aspherical explosion may well decrease @xmath154 and increase the central remnant mass @xmath155 ( @xcite ) . therefore , assuming that aspherical fallback takes place in the high - energy models with @xmath136 , 10 , and 20 , we estimate the amount of fallback to yield @xmath153 and then the ejected masses for the models as @xmath156 . as a result",

    "[ fig : vrho ] ) , we synthesize bolometric lcs for the models with @xmath136 , 10 , and 20 using the lte radiation hydrodynamics code and the gray @xmath150-ray transfer code @xcite . in the radiative transfer calculation ,",
    "the electron scattering is calculated for the ionization states solved by the saha equation and the rosseland mean opacity is approximated with an empirical relation to the electron - scattering opacity @xcite .",
    "the peak width ( @xmath162 ) of the sn lc depends on the ejected mass @xmath157 , explosion energy @xmath145 , opacity @xmath163 , density structure , and @xmath4nidistribution , as @xmath164 @xcite , where @xmath165 represents the effects of the density structure and the @xmath4ni  distribution . here , we assume for sake of simplicity a uniform mixing of @xmath4ni  in the sn ejecta .",
    "also , the density structures after the sn explosions with various @xmath145 are analogous .",

    "figure  [ fig : lc ] also shows the multicolor and bolometric lcs of sn  2006jc .",
    "the period of sn  2006jc is divided into four epochs depending on the available observations : ( 1 ) uv and optical photometries at @xmath166 days , ( 2 ) optical and nir photometries at @xmath63 days , ( 3 ) optical photometry at @xmath65 days , and ( 4 ) optical , nir , and mir photometries and nir spectroscopy at @xmath64 days .",

    "the contribution of @xmath172 to the total luminosity increases from @xmath180 at @xmath181 days to @xmath28 at @xmath33 days .",
    "the estimated ir luminosity is consistent with the luminosity emitted from the hot carbon dust at @xmath33 days (   [ sec : irest ] ) .",
    "since the dust temperature decreases with time , the ratio of the mir luminosities to the nir luminosities becomes larger with time .",
    "therefore , the amorphous carbon emission model reasonably estimates the ir luminosity due to the hot carbon dust at @xmath182 days .",
    "the model with @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath169 reproduces well the lc decline at @xmath64 days and the ir luminosities due to the hot carbon dust at @xmath33 days days was presented by @xcite .",
    "they estimated the total luminosity and the dust temperature as @xmath185ergs  s@xmath23  and @xmath186  k , respectively .",

    "this suggests that the observed ir emissions at @xmath190 days may originate not only from the newly - formed dust in the sn ejecta heated by the @xmath4ni-@xmath4co  decay but also from the light echo of the csm dust . ] .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the hypernova - like sn explosion model with @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath169 is the most preferable model among the exploded models of a wco wolf - rayet star with @xmath110 .",
    "x - rays from sn  2006jc were detected by the _ swift _ and _ chandra _ satellites @xcite .",
    "the x - ray detection indicates that the expanding sn ejecta collides with the csm .",
    "we calculate x - ray emission from the ejecta - csm interaction for the sn model with ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) @xmath161 ( 4.9 , 10 ) , and estimate the csm density structure on the basis of a comparison with the observed x - ray lc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosities estimated with the distance of @xmath191 mpc in @xcite are scaled using @xmath192 mpc .",

    "both regions are heated by the shock waves and emit x - rays .",
    "in such a compact star , because the density in the shocked sn ejecta is higher than that in the shocked csm , the emitted x - rays from the shocked sn ejecta are more luminous than those from the shocked csm ( fig .",

    "our calculation does not show the formation of a cooling shell .",
    "this is because the csm interaction is so weak to emit x - ray of @xmath211 ergs  s@xmath23 .",
    "if the bolometric luminosity is powered by the csm interaction , i.e. , if the csm interaction emits as high luminosity as @xmath212 ergs  s@xmath23 , the cooling shell might form and thus the dust formation might be possible .",
    "further detailed studies , however , are required to confirm the dust formation behind the reverse shock .",
    "such a flat density profile of the inner csm implies that the stellar wind was not steady because the steady wind should form the csm of @xmath213 .",
    "this circumstellar environment might have been formed by a variable mass - loss rate @xmath214 and/or a variable wind velocity @xmath215 .",
    "for example , assuming that the stellar wind blew with a constant @xmath216 km s@xmath23 for two years before the explosion , the mass - loss rate must have changed from @xmath217 to @xmath218 @xmath219 yr@xmath23 in two years .",
    "such a drastic change of the mass - loss rate and/or the wind velocity is consistent with the fact that the progenitor of sn  2006jc was surrounded by the matter ejected by the lbv - like event two years before the explosion .",
    "we present a theoretical model for sn  2006jc whose properties are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) * wco progenitor and dust formation * : the progenitor is a wco wolf - rayet star whose total mass has been reduced from @xmath220 to as small as @xmath110 .",
    "the wco star model has a thick c - rich envelope and csm .",
    "this is consistent with the formation of amorphous carbon grains in the sn ejecta and the csm suggested by _ akari _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite have calculated dust formation in the wco star explosion model and shown that carbon dust is formed in the c - rich layer at @xmath168 days .",
    "this is much earlier than the dust formation after @xmath221 yr in type ii sne ( sne  ii ) , because of the much smaller @xmath157 in the wco star than sne  ii . according to the models in @xcite ,",
    "the stars with @xmath104 typically become wco stars to form a thick c - rich layer and csm . this limiting mass , however , is still uncertain and strongly depends on many details of the stellar evolution .",
    "the early dust formation in the sn ejecta and the csm suggests that the progenitor of sn  2006jc is a massive star becoming a wco wolf - rayet star .",
    "\\(2 ) * explosion and bolometric light curve * : the multicolor lcs of sn  2006jc show peculiar evolutions , e.g. , a rapid decline of the optical lc and brightening of the ir lc .",
    "these can be interpreted as an ongoing dust formation . assuming the absorbed optical light is re - emitted in the ir band , the bolometric lc is constructed as a summation of @xmath26 ( @xmath176 ) , @xmath20 , and @xmath66 .",
    "by calculating the hydrodynamics , nucleosynthesis , and the bolometric lc for the sn explosion with the various explosion energies , @xmath135 , 5 , 10 , and 20 , we find that the hypernova - like sn explosion model with @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath169 best reproduces the bolometric lc of sn  2006jc with the radioactive decays .",
    "also , the temperature evolution of the carbon dust heated by the @xmath4ni-@xmath4co  decay reasonably well explains the ir observations for @xmath222 days @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) * csm interaction and x - ray light curve * : applying the model with @xmath183 and @xmath184 , we calculate the ejecta - csm interaction and the resultant x - ray lc .",
    "we derive the csm density structure to reproduce the x - ray lc of sn  2006jc as @xmath204 g @xmath199 for @xmath201 cm and @xmath205 g @xmath199 for @xmath203 cm .",
    "the flat density distribution in the inner csm indicates a drastic change of the mass - loss rate and/or the wind velocity that is consistent with the lbv - like event two years before the explosion .",
    "* lbv connection * : our model does not take into account the lbv - like event that occurred two years before the explosion .",
    "the first reason is that the mechanism of the outburst is still unclear .",
    "the second reason is that , at least in the framework of the current understanding of standard stellar evolution , the envelope of a massive star practically freezes out after core he exhaustion ( i.e. , about 10000 years before the explosion ) due to the more rapid evolution of the core than the envelope .",
    "in addition , it is interesting to note that , and this is a confirmation of the theoretical expectation , there is no observational evidence that any wolf - rayet star has ever undergone such a luminous outburst @xcite .",
    "hence , there is no specific reason to associate the occurrence of a lbv - like outburst to the presupernova evolution .",
    "future studies on the mechanism of the outburst are required to firmly conclude the origin of the lbv - like outburst .",
    "it would be possible that a possible binary companion star could undergo the lbv - like outburst .",
    "* fallback * : according to our hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis calculations , in the spherically symmetric models with @xmath223 , the fallback does not take place and thus the amount of synthesized @xmath4ni  is much larger than @xmath169 which is required to power the lc of sn  2006jc (   [ sec:56ni ] ) . in the aspherical explosions",
    ", however , the fallback takes place even for @xmath223 . in this paper",
    ", we assume the fallback even for the models with @xmath223 and derive the amount of fallback to yield the appropriate amount of @xmath4ni . to justify the above assumption",
    ", we calculate an aspherical explosion induced by a jet with an opening angle of @xmath224 and an energy deposition rate of @xmath225 @xcite .",
    "the jet - induced model realizes an explosion with @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 that is consistent with the adopted model .",
    "we note that an aspherical radiative transfer calculation is required to confirm that the jet - induced explosion model can reproduce the lc of sn  2006jc .    * light curve models * : the model with @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath169 is not an unique model to reproduce the bolometric lc of sn  2006jc . in the case of usual sne",
    ", the velocities of the absorption lines can disentangle the degeneracy of @xmath157 and @xmath145 by means of the comparison with the photospheric velocities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the spectra of sn  2006jc are dominated by he emission lines and the nature is unclear .",
    "thus we can not fully resolve the degeneracy . since the lc shape is proportional to @xmath229 , the model with a larger @xmath157 requires a higher @xmath145 .",
    "an explosion of the progenitor star with a larger @xmath96 reproduces the lc of sn  2006jc with a higher @xmath145 and the x - ray lc with a lower csm density . on the other hand , an explosion of the progenitor star with a smaller @xmath96 reproduces the lc with a lower @xmath145 , e.g. ,",
    "an explosion with @xmath230 and @xmath135 can explain the lc shape of sn  2006jc .",
    "however , such low @xmath145 explosions suppress explosive nucleosynthesis and enhance the fallback . as a result",
    ", the @xmath4niproduction is reduced for a small @xmath96 .",
    "if the lc of sn  2006jc is powered by the @xmath4ni-@xmath4co  decay , the bright peak indicates a larger amount of @xmath4ni  production ( @xmath231 ) than a normal sn [ @xmath232 , e.g. , sn  1987a , @xcite ] .",
    "therefore , sn  2006jc is likely a more energetic explosion than a normal sn with @xmath233 .",
    "* dust formation * : we assume that the energy source of the lc of sn  2006jc is the @xmath4ni-@xmath4co  decay . this consistently explains the formation of carbon dust at the early epoch ( @xmath168days ) and the dust temperature at @xmath24days @xcite . in this scenario , however , the origin of the bright blue continuum remains an unsolved problem ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a spectrum might be explained by the ejecta - csm interaction . in this scenario ,",
    "however , the fine tunings are required to reproduce the bolometric lc ; most of the x - rays are absorbed and converted to the optical luminosity , which only a small fraction of the x - rays are emitted with changing the fraction from @xmath234 at @xmath235 days to @xmath236 at @xmath237 days . moreover ,",
    "the formation of carbon dust with two temperatures would not be explained .",
