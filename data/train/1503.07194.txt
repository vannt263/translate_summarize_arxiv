    "iron - bearing mgsio@xmath0 perovskite ( si - pv ) is one of the major constituent minerals of earth s lower mantle along with ( mg , fe)o ferropericlase ( fp ) .",
    "unraveling the composition and thermal structure of the lower mantle requires a detailed understanding of the influence of iron ( fe ) on these host minerals .",
    "it is well known that iron in ( mg , fe)o undergoes a pressure induced spin crossover from high - spin ( s=2 ) to low - spin ( s=0 ) state and affects elastic properties @xcite . in the case of si - pv , deciphering the iron spin state has been quite challenging due to complex perovskite structure and possibility of different valence states of iron ( ferric and ferrous ) .",
    "si - pv is also known to undergo a perovskite ( pv ) to post - perovskite ( ppv ) phase transition at @xmath4 125 gpa and this will have geophysical consequences in deep lower mantle region @xcite . understanding the effect of iron , especially , on pv to ppv transition and on elastic properties of pv and ppv phases is crucial to constrain lower mantle composition .    in ( mg , fe@xmath1)sio@xmath0-pv",
    ", the pressure induced increase in m@xmath5ssbauer quadrupole splitting ( qs ) above @xmath430 gpa ( low - qs to high - qs transition ) @xcite has been explained by lateral displacement of fe@xmath1 ion which remains in the high - spin ( hs ) state in the entire lower - mantle pressure range @xcite . in the case of ( mg , fe@xmath2)(si , fe@xmath2)o@xmath0-pv , however , first - principles calculations by @xcite reported that fe@xmath2 in b - site undergoes a high - spin ( s=5/2 ) to low - spin ( s=1/2 ) state change at approximately 41 gpa and 70 gpa using lda+u@xmath3 and gga+u@xmath3 methods , respectively , while in the a - site fe@xmath2 remains in the high - spin state .",
    "these findings were in good agreement with experimental observations of @xcite .",
    "there have also been several experimental @xcite and first - principles @xcite studies about the spin crossover in mgsio@xmath0-ppv ( si - ppv ) .",
    "the consensus regarding the spin crossover in iron - bearing si - ppv is that fe@xmath1 in the a - site remains in the high - spin and high - qs state throughout the lower mantle pressure range , while fe@xmath2 undergoes a high to low spin transition in the b site and remains in the high spin state in the a - site @xcite . in spite of these efforts to pin down the state of iron at high pressures , it has been very difficult to ascertain the exact role of iron with its varying spin and valence state on pv to ppv transition , especially because of the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the deep lower mantle region .",
    "mggeo@xmath0-perovskite ( ge - pv ) is a low pressure analog of mgsio@xmath0 perovskite @xcite and would be a promising candidate to investigate iron spin crossover and its structural influence on mgsio@xmath0-pv and ppv phases . in this study , we have used first - principles dft+u ( lda+u@xmath3 and gga+u@xmath3 ) calculations to investigate the iron spin states and their crossover in the pv and ppv phases of fe@xmath1- and fe@xmath2-bearing mggeo@xmath0 . comparing enthalpy of the different spin states , we have determined the stability of the different states and transition pressure . using these results ,",
    "we have also investigated the effect of fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2 substitution on pv to ppv transition .",
    "we have used density functional theory ( dft ) within the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite augmented by the hubbard u ( lda / gga+u@xmath3 ) , calculated self - consistently and structurally consistently @xcite .",
    "ultrasoft pseudo - potentials , generated by vanderbilt s method @xcite , have been used for fe , si , ge , and o. for mg , norm - conserving pseudo - potential generated by von barth - car s method , has been used .",

    "self - consistent u@xmath3 , calculated by @xcite and @xcite using the linear response approach @xcite ( table [ table : u_sc ] ) , have been used .",
    "all calculations were performed in a 40-atoms super - cell .",
    "electronic states were sampled on a shifted @xmath6 and @xmath7 k - point grid for pv and ppv structure , respectively @xcite .",
    "structural optimization at any arbitrary volume has been performed using variable cell - shape damped molecular dynamics approach @xcite .",
    "structures are optimized until the inter - atomic forces are smaller than 10@xmath8 @xmath9 . for every possible",
    "spin and valence state , structures are optimized at twelve volumes in the relevant pressure - range and the 3@xmath10-order birch - murngharn equation of state has been used to fit these compression data .",
    "iron spin states have been investigated in fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2-bearing mggeo@xmath0 and mgsio@xmath0 in a 40-atom super - cell .",
    "one fe@xmath1 ion is substituted for a mg@xmath1 ion in the a - site in ( mg@xmath11fe@xmath12)geo@xmath0 and ( mg@xmath11fe@xmath12)sio@xmath0 while two fe@xmath2 s are substituted for one mg@xmath1 and one first neighbor ge@xmath13 or si@xmath13 as in ( mg@xmath11fe@xmath12)(ge@xmath11fe@xmath12)o@xmath0 and ( mg@xmath11fe@xmath12)(si@xmath11fe@xmath12)o@xmath0 .",

    "effects of disorder have not been addressed at this point , but it is expected to produce a two - phase loop . here",
    "we wish to analyze ( a ) the potentially different effects of fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2 in the pv to ppv transition and ( b ) whether the germanate phase could serve as a good low pressure analog to investigate spin transitions in iron .      as in the case of fe@xmath1 in si - pv @xcite , fe@xmath1 in ge - pv",
    "remains in the high - spin ( hs , s=2 ) state in the entire lower - mantle pressure range ( 0 - 135 gpa ) .",
    "however , it undergoes a pressure induced lateral displacement producing a transition from low to high m@xmath5ssbauer quadrupole splitting ( qs ) .",

    "the pressure dependence of enthalpy differences between high - qs and low - qs states ( @xmath15h = h@xmath16-h@xmath17 ) gives the low- to high - qs transition pressure .",
    "it is well - known that lda usually underestimates transition pressures while gga usually overestimates it . in this study",
    ", we present both lda+u@xmath3 and gga+u@xmath3 results to provide lower and upper bounds for this transition , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) .",
    "the low- to high - qs state change in ge - pv occurs at @xmath428.5 gpa with lda+u@xmath3 and at @xmath440.5 gpa with gga+u@xmath3 .",
    "these transition pressures are quite large compared to those in si - pv , i.e. , @xmath49.5 gpa and @xmath422.5 gpa respectively as presented in table [ table : p_t ] .    owing to the larger ionic radius of ge@xmath13 ( 0.53 @xmath18 )",
    "compared to that of si@xmath13 ( 0.40 @xmath18 ) , the unit - cell volume and inter - atomic distances in ge - pv are larger than in si - pv .",
    "zero pressure fe - o bond - lengths in si - pv and ge - pv obtained with lda+u@xmath3 are shown fig . [ fig2](a ) .",
    "the average of fe - o bond - lengths , @xmath19fe - o@xmath20 , is also shown in fig . [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the larger @xmath19fe - o@xmath20 value in ge - pv allows fe@xmath1 to sustain higher pressures than in si - pv before changing to the high - qs state .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this transition occurs when the @xmath19fe - o@xmath20 reaches a particular value ( @xmath42.22 @xmath18 ) whether in ge - pv or in si - pv , whether using lda+u@xmath3 or gga+u@xmath3 methods ( fig . [ fig2].(b ) ) .",
    "it should be noted that the pv to ppv transition is expected to occur at approximately @xmath463 gpa in mggeo@xmath0 @xcite and at @xmath4125 gpa in mgsio@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these pressures are much higher than low- to high - qs transition pressures in both fe@xmath1-bearing compounds .",
    "consequently , this transition has not been investigated in si - ppv or ge - ppv phases .",
    "next , we investigate spin states of fe@xmath2 in the b - site of ge - pv ( low - pressure ) and ppv ( high - pressure ) phases . the crystal structures of si - pv and si - ppv phases are shown in fig . [ fig3](a ) .",
    "si - ppv has a layered structure characterized by corner - sharing and edge - sharing sio@xmath21 octahedra extending along the a - c plane . the pressure dependence of calculated enthalpy differences between high - spin ( hs ) and low - spin ( ls ) states of fe@xmath2 ( @xmath15h = h@xmath22-h@xmath23 ) in pv and ppv phases are shown in fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the calculated hs to ls transition pressures in ge - pv are 56.5 gpa with lda+u@xmath3 and 85.0 gpa with gga+u@xmath3 . similarly , these transition pressures in ge - ppv are 49.5 gpa and 82.5 gpa with these methods .",
    "our calculated transition pressures in si - pv are 41.0 gpa with lda+u@xmath3 and 69.5 gpa with gga+u@xmath3 , which are in very good agreement with previous first - principles study @xcite . in the case of si - ppv ,",
    "our calculated transition pressures are 28.0 gpa and 59.5 gpa , respectively , which are quite larger than previously reported values of -30 gpa and 36 gpa @xcite .",
    "these transition pressures in si - pv and si - ppv are also very similar to those reported by @xcite in ( mg , al)(si , fe)o@xmath0-pv and ppv phases where it was observed that the presence of aluminum does not affect the spin transition pressure significantly . considering the overall agreement of the stability of the iron spin states and pressure induced crossover in si - pv and si - ppv phases with previous studies @xcite , the present calculations about hs to ls transition in fe@xmath2 at b site seems to be consistent and reliable .    in order to explain the increase of hs to ls transition pressures in mggeo@xmath0 phases , we compare atomic configurations around fe@xmath2 in the b - site of si - pv and ge - pv phases . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , the coordination number of fe@xmath2 is six and fe - o bond lengths in this site are smaller than those of fe@xmath1 in the a - site .",
    "the pressure dependence of the average bond - length , @xmath19fe - o@xmath20 , for fe@xmath2 in the b - site in si - pv and ge - pv phases are shown in fig . [ fig4](b ) . as in the case of low- to high - qs transition in fe@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the hs to ls transition in fe@xmath2 in ge - pv and ge - ppv phases are also large compared to those in si - pv and si - ppv phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) due to relatively larger fe - o bond - lengths and unit - cell volumes in germanate phases at a given pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "similar to low- to high - qs transition , the hs to ls transition also occurs only when the @xmath19fe - o@xmath20 reaches a particular value ( i.e. , @xmath41.86 @xmath18 in the present case ) irrespective of ge - pv or si - pv , or of the exchange - correlation functional used ( fig . [ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "this is a useful insight for predicting pressure induced spin state changes in different materials .",
    "having investigated the stability of different iron states in the lower mantle pressure range in the previous section , we now focus on the potential effect of fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2 substitution on the pv to ppv transition .",
    "this is a plain static calculation to access the overall influence of iron substitution on the pv to ppv transition in these phases .",
    "we have not included finite temperature entropic or vibrational effects , therefore , we are not able to produce a full phase diagram with a two phase loop region .",
    "this is simply the first step towards the calculation of such phase diagrams .",
    "it is well known that the lda functional underestimates the equilibrium volume while gga overestimates it .",
    "after inclusion of vibrational effects lda equations of state and elastic properties tend to agree better with experimental data than gga results @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have chosen lda+u@xmath3 results to investigate the effect of fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2 in the pv to ppv transition in both compounds .",
    "previous studies based on _ ab initio _ calculations @xcite and experimental measurements @xcite have reported the pv to ppv transition in mgsio@xmath0 and mggeo@xmath0 to occur around @xmath4125 gpa and @xmath463 gpa , respectively , at @xmath42500 k.    as indicated in fig . [",
    "fig1](b ) and in table [ table : p_t ] , the low- to high - qs transition in si - pv and ge - pv occurs at much lower pressures than the pv to ppv transition in these minerals @xcite .",
    "considering this fact , only the high pressure high - qs state of fe@xmath1 was considered in the investigation of the pv to ppv transition .",
    "similarly , near the pv to ppv transition pressure , the stable state of fe@xmath2 substituted in both si - pv and si - ppv phases is hs state in the a - site ( hs - a ) and ls state in the b - site ( ls - b ) .",
    "however , in germanate phases , the hs - b to ls - b transition pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and table [ table : p_t ] ) is near the pv to ppv transition pressure . in order to find the appropriate spin states of fe@xmath2 across the transition we have considered all possibilities in the calculation of enthalpy differences ( @xmath15h = h@xmath24-h@xmath25 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) the transition pressure 55.5 gpa involves a transition between hs - b in ge - pv to ls - b in ge - ppv . obviously iron in the a site remains in the hs state . at high temperatures , contributions by other states might be relevant as well , but this issue is well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "this transition and transition pressure , i.e. , hs - b in pv and ls - b in ppv , is the only combination consistent with b(hs ) to b(ls ) transition pressures of 56.5 gpa and 49.5 gpa in ge - pv and ge - ppv , respectively .",
    "the effect of fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2 on the pv to ppv transition in si - pv and ge - pv is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] showing the pressure dependence of enthalpy differences ( @xmath15h = h@xmath24-h@xmath25 ) for the configurations indicated in the previous paragraph .",
    "static ( zero temperature ) pv to ppv transition pressures in iron - free ( x=0 ) mggeo@xmath0 and mgsio@xmath0 are 43.2 gpa and 94 gpa , respectively .",
    "the clapeyron slope for the pv to ppv transitions have been previously estimated to be @xmath4 7.5 mpa / k for mgsio@xmath0 @xcite and 7.8 mpa / k for mggeo@xmath0 @xcite . taking these clapeyron slopes approximately into account , transition pressures at @xmath42500",
    "k should be @xmath4 62.7 gpa and @xmath4 112.8 gpa for mggeo@xmath0 and mgsio@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with previous experimental measurements and _ ab initio _ lda calculations @xcite .",
    "a summary of transition pressure shifts caused by iron in silicate and germanate phases is indicated in ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , table [ table : pv - ppv - p_c ] ) .",
    "as indicated , fe@xmath1 decreases the pv to ppv transition pressure in both mggeo@xmath0 and mgsio@xmath0 .",
    "these observations are consistent with previous experimental @xcite and _ ab initio _ studies @xcite . however , in the case fe@xmath2 , the pv to ppv transition pressure increases noticeably . to the best of our knowledge , this fact has not been verified experimentally yet .    to understand these opposite effects of fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2 substitution on the pv to ppv transition , the volume difference between si - pv and si - ppv phase ( @xmath15v = v@xmath24-v@xmath25 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) .",
    "with respect to iron - free case , the volume difference is smaller and larger in magnitude with fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2 substitution , respectively .",
    "these smaller and larger volume difference will contribute to enthalpy difference between pv and ppv phase in such a way that will decrease the trasniton pressure with fe@xmath1 substitution while it will increase when fe@xmath2 is substituted .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b and c ) , where pressure dependence of energy ( @xmath15e ) and p@xmath26v term [ @xmath15(pv ) ] of relative enthalpy ( @xmath15h ) are shown separately . transition pressure points , where @xmath15e and @xmath15(pv ) terms cancel each other , are shown by vertical dashed lines .",
    "using _ ab initio _ dft+u calculations , we have undertaken a comparative investigation of state changes of ferrous ( fe@xmath1 ) and ferric ( fe@xmath2 ) iron in mgsio@xmath0 and mggeo@xmath0 perovskite ( pv ) and post - perovskite ( ppv ) phases .",
    "the goal was to verify the possibility of using mggeo@xmath0 as a low pressure analog of mgsio@xmath0 for better understanding of spin state changes in iron .",
    "unfortunately , owing to the larger ionic radius of germanium , fe - o inter - atomic distances in the germanate phases are larger than in the silicate phases , allowing the germanates to sustain higher pressures than analog silicates before state changes in iron take place .",
    "it has been clearly shown that such state changes , whether the displacement transition ( low- to high - qs ) of fe@xmath1 in the a - site or the hs to ls state change in fe@xmath2 in the b - site , take place at approximately the same average fe - o , @xmath19fe - o@xmath20 , distance irrespective of the chemistry or the exchange and correlation functional used in the calculations .",
    "this encompassing investigation also allowed us to address the effect of fe@xmath1 and fe@xmath2 substitutions on the pv to ppv transition . despite the simplicity of these static calculations , previously measured and calculated effect of fe@xmath1 on this transition in mgsio@xmath0",
    "is well reproduced : fe@xmath1 substitution decreases the transition pressure , whether in germanate or silicate phases .",
    "however , we report the opposite effect for fe@xmath2 substitution in the b - site . this transition should involve the ls - b state in both pv and ppv silicate phases but hs - b and ls - b states in pv and ppv germanates , respectively .",
    "for both types of transitions the effect is the same : coupled substitution of fe@xmath2 increases the pv to ppv transition in both materials .",
    "this observation has not been validated by experiments yet and should be relevant for better understanding the d  discontinuity and the nature of the deep lower mantle .",
