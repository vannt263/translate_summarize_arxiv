    "the physics of exclusive heavy meson decays has provided very useful testing ground for the precise determination of the fundamental parameters of the standard model(sm ) and the development of a better understanding of the qcd dynamics .",
    "while the experimental tests of exclusive heavy meson decays are much easier than those of inclusive one , the theoretical understanding of exclusive decays is complicated mainly due to the nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements entered in the long distance nonperturbative contributions . since a rigrous field - theoretic formulation with a first principle application of qcd to make a reliable estimates of the nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements has not so far been possible , most of theoretical efforts have been devoted to looking for phenomenological approaches to nonperturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "along with various exclusive processes such as leptonic , semileptonic and rare decays of heavy mesons , the one - photon radiative decays from the low - lying heavy vector(v ) to heavy pseudoscalar(p ) mesons , i.e. magnetic dipole @xmath11 transitions , have been considered as a valuable testing ground to pin down the best phenomenological model of hadrons .",
    "for example , the calculations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 radiative decays have been investigated by various theoretical approaches , such as the quark model  @xcite , light cone qcd sum rules  @xcite , heavy quark effective theory(hqet )  @xcite , cloudy bag model(cbm )  @xcite , and chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , the radiative decays between two heavy quarkonia such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 have also been studied by the potential nonrelativistic qcd(pnrqcd )  @xcite and relativistic quark model  @xcite approaches . in our previous light - front quark model(lfqm ) analysis  @xcite based on the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian , we have analyzed various exlcusive processes such as the @xmath16 semileptonic heavy meson decays  @xcite , rare @xmath17 decays  @xcite and radiative @xmath0 and @xmath18 decays of light - flavored mesons(@xmath19 )  @xcite and found a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to investigate the magnetic dipole transition @xmath0 for the heavy - flavored mesons such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 using our lfqm  @xcite .",
    "since the experimental data available in this heavy - flavored sector are scanty , predictions of a model , if found reliable , can be utilized quite fruitfully .",
    "in addition , we calculate the weak decay constants of heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons , which play important roles in many aspects , such as in the determination of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements , in the leptonic or nonleptonic weak decays of mesons , and in the neutral @xmath20 or @xmath21 mixing process , etc .",
    "our lfqm  @xcite used in the present analysis has a couple of salient features compared to other lfqm  @xcite analysis : ( 1 ) we have implemented the variational principle to qcd - motivated effective lf hamiltonian to enable us to analyze the meson mass spectra and to find optimized model parameters , which are to be used subsequently in the present investigation .",
    "such an approach can better constrain the phenomelogical parameters and establish the extent of applicability of our lfqm to wider ranging hadronic phenomena .",
    "( 2 ) we have performed the analytic continuation from the spacelike(@xmath22 ) region to the physical timelike region(@xmath23 ) to obtain the decay form factors @xmath3 for @xmath4 transitions . the drell - yan - west(@xmath24 ) frame is useful because only valence contributions are needed , i.e. the hadronic matrix element @xmath25 is represented as the overlap of valence wave function , as far as the  @xmath26 \" component of the current is used .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we briefly describe the formulation of our lfqm  @xcite and the procedure of fixing the model parameters using the variational principle for the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian . the decay constants and radiative @xmath0 decay widths for heavy - flavored mesons are then uniquely determined in our model calculation . in sec .",
    "iii , the formulae for the decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector mesons as well as the decay widths for @xmath0 in our lfqm are given . to obtain the @xmath27-dependent transition form factors",
    "@xmath3 for @xmath4 transitions , we use the @xmath5 frame(i.e .",
    "@xmath28 ) and then analytically continue the spacelike results to the timelike @xmath29 region by changing @xmath6 to @xmath7 in the form factor .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath8 needed for the calculations of the decay widths for @xmath0 can then be determined in the limit as @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 . in sec .",
    "iv , we present our numerical results and compare with the available experimental data as well as other theoretical model predictions .",
    "summary and conclusions follow in sec.v .",
    "the key idea in our lfqm  @xcite for mesons is to treat the radial wave function as trial function for the variational principle to the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian saturating the fock state expansion by the constituent quark and antiquark .",

    "we use two interaction potentials @xmath33 for the pseudoscalar(@xmath34 ) and vector(@xmath35 ) mesons : ( 1 ) coulomb plus harmonic oscllator(ho ) , and ( 2 ) coulomb plus linear confining potentials .",
    "in addition , the hyperfine interaction , which is essential to distinguish vector from pseudoscalar mesons , is included for both cases , viz . , [ pot ] v_q|q = v_0 + v_hyp = a + v_conf- + ^2v_coul , where @xmath36 for the linear(ho ) potential and @xmath37 for the vector(pseudoscalar ) meson .    the momentum space light - front wave function of the ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons is given by [ w.f ] ^jj_z_100(x_i,*k*_i,_i ) = r^jj_z__1_2(x_i,*k*_i ) ( x_i,*k*_i ) , where @xmath38 is the radial wave function and @xmath39 is the spin - orbit wave function , which is obtained by the interaction independent melosh transformation from the ordinary equal - time static spin - orbit wave function assigned by the quantum numbers @xmath40 . the model wave function in eq .",

    "the spin - orbit wave functions satisfy the following relations [ rsum ] _",

    ", we use the same gaussian wave function for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons [ rad ] ( x_i,*k*_i)= ( -k^2/2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath52 is the variational parameter .",
    "when the longitudinal component @xmath53 is defined by @xmath54 , the jacobian of the variable transformation @xmath55 is given by [ jacob ] = \\ { 1- ^2}. note that the free kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xmath56 is equal to the free mass operator @xmath57 in the light - front formalism .",
