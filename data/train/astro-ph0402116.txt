    "gravitational lensing has the ability to probe the internal mass distributions of galaxies at cosmological distances .",
    "the ability to form complete samples , based solely on mass , has allowed studies of the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "anomalous flux - density ratios observed in merging gravitational lens images have recently been used to argue for cold dark matter substructure within the haloes of lensing galaxies @xcite .",
    "the magnification of the lensed source has also allowed studies of star - formation at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) and the dust content of quasar host galaxies to be estimated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gravitational lenses have proved to be powerful tools for determining the cosmological parameters .",
    "lenses with well - constrained mass models and accurate time - delay measurements have been used to calculate the hubble parameter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational lensing statistics from large systematic surveys have provided complementary and independent constraints on the cosmological constant and density parameters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to those obtained from sn1a @xcite , large - scale structure @xcite and cosmic microwave background @xcite observations .",
    "in addition , the nature of the curvature parameter can also be determined from the image - separations and source redshifts via the @xmath8-@xmath9 relation @xcite . however , each of these applications of gravitational lensing is critically dependent on the redshifts of the lensing galaxy and lensed source being known .    with the objectives outlined above in mind",
    ", a spectroscopic survey of galaxy - scale gravitational lenses using the w. m. keck and palomar observatories has been underway over the last few years @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present our latest results .",
    "the observing sample consisted of four gravitational lenses discovered during the course of the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; @xcite ) . in section [ spec - targets ] a short review of each of these gravitational lenses is given .",
    "the observations with the w. m. keck - i telescope are presented in section [ spec - obs ] and the optical spectra are presented in section [ spec - results ] .",
    "the resulting implications for each gravitational lens are discussed in section [ spec - disc ] .",
    "finally , in section [ spec - conc ] a summary of the observations and analysis presented in this paper is given .",
    "throughout we adopted an @xmath10 , @xmath11 flat - universe , with a hubble parameter @xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 .",
    "the targets of our observations were class b0128 + 437 , class b0445 + 123 , class b0631 + 519 and class b0850 + 054 .",
    "a short review of each gravitational lens is given below .",
    "the quadruple - imaged gravitational lens system class b0128 + 437 is described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "merlin ( multi element radio linked interferometer network ) 5  ghz imaging detected four compact components , with a maximum image separation of @xmath14 , arranged in a classic quad - lens formation .",
    "the 325  mhz to 8.46  ghz radio - spectrum was found to be strongly peaked around @xmath15  ghz , which suggested the lensed source may be a compact symmetric object ( cso ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up vlba ( very long baseline array ) imaging at 5  ghz found sub - structure consistent with the lensing of a cso hypothesis .",
    "however , it should be noted that the recent vlbi observations of @xcite have placed the cso interpretation in some doubt since a flat - spectrum compact core appears to be present in 3 of the 4 images , suggesting a core - jet structure .",
    "optical hst ( hubble space telescope ) and infra - red ukirt ( united kingdom infra - red telescope ) photometry found class b0128 + 437 to be highly reddened ( @xmath16 ) , with the dominant infra - red emission being from the lensed images .",
    "therefore , the background source in class b0128 + 437 is thought to be highly redshifted and/or the lensing galaxy is extremely dusty .",
    "recent modelling attempts favour lensing by a spiral galaxy , although conclusive observational evidence of this has still to be obtained @xcite .      class b0445 + 123 ( @xcite ) is a double - imaged gravitational lens system .",
    "8.46  ghz vla ( very large array ) and 5  ghz merlin and vlba observations found two compact components separated by @xmath17 with identical radio - spectra .",
    "more sensitive 8.46  ghz vla imaging detected extended , arc - like structure in component a. imaging with the wht ( william herschel telescope ) detected faint extended optical emission with an @xmath18-band magnitude of @xmath19-mag . however , the resolution was not sufficient to separate the lensed images from the lensing galaxy .      class b0631 + 519 ( york et al . , in preparation ) is a new double - imaged gravitational lens system discovered by class .",
    "this lens was found to have two compact components separated by @xmath20 when observed at 8.46  ghz with the vla .",
    "observations with merlin and the vlba at 5  ghz detected structure in the radio components which was consistent with gravitational lensing .",
    "optical imaging with the wht detected emission ( @xmath18-band @xmath21-mag ) mainly from the lensing galaxy .",
    "the wealth of observational constraints available in class b0631 + 519 make this gravitational lens an exciting prospect for detailed modelling of the lensing potential in the future .",
    "class b0850 + 054 @xcite is a double - imaged gravitational lens system .",
    "the two components , separated by @xmath22 , are compact when observed with the vla and merlin at 8.46  ghz and 5  ghz respectively .",
    "however , high resolution imaging with the vlba at 5  ghz shows sub - structure in component a consistent with gravitational lensing .",
    "ukirt @xmath23-band imaging detected infra - red emission ( 18.4-mag ) believed to be mainly from the lensing galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , the resolution was insufficient to determine the position of the lensing galaxy relative to the lensed images and mass - modelling has not been possible . a flux - density monitoring program at 8.46  ghz with the vla has not detected any variability in class b0850 + 054 .",
    "like class b0128 + 437 , the radio - spectrum of class b0850 + 054 turns - over at @xmath24  ghz which , coupled with the lack of variability , suggests the background source may be a cso .",

    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out using the w. m. keck - i 10-m telescope on 2001 november 16 and 17 . on both nights the conditions were photometric and the fwhm seeing was typically @xmath25 .",
    "the optical spectroscopy was taken through the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) with a @xmath26-wide longslit .",
    "lris has a red ( lris - r ) and a blue ( lris - b ) camera ; each with a @xmath27 pixel array .",
    "together they can provide spectral coverage between @xmath28   .",

    "a @xmath31  grooves  mm@xmath13 grism blazed at 5000   produced a dispersion of @xmath32    pixel@xmath13 and a wavelength coverage of @xmath33   through lris - b .",

    "were set to single and dual amp readout modes , respectively .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standard star bd@xmath39 @xcite were taken to flatten the spectra and identify sky absorption features during the reduction stage . at the end of each night ,",
    "spectroscopic dome flat - field exposures , bias frames and arcs were taken .    during the first night",
    "the lris autoguider and rotator were not operational .",
    "as a consequence imaging and accurate guiding were not possible .",
    "spectroscopy of class b0631 + 519 was therefore attempted as it was optically bright enough for accurate manual guiding .",
    "the rotator was functioning on the second night which allowed accurate offsetting to the fainter gravitational lenses .",
    "however , slit position angles were set such that each gravitational lens and a suitably bright nearby object were in the slit . this allowed confirmation that each gravitational lens had been detected .",
    "a summary of the observing run is given in table [ log ] .",
    "the exposure times were typically @xmath40  seconds .",
    "however , for class b0850 + 054 the exposure times for lris - b and -r differed due to a software problem with the lris - b control system during the second observation .    .observing logs for spectroscopic observations of class gravitational lenses class b0128 + 437 , class b0445 + 123 , class b0631 + 519 and class b0850 + 054 .",
    "slit position angles ( pa ) are given east of north .",
    "for the class b0631 + 519 observation there was no defined slit pa because the instrument rotator was not operational and therefore the slit pa was not fixed .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]      an intriguing feature of the class b0631 + 519 spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ lens-0631 ] , is the presence of a low redshift galaxy at @xmath42 . in the analysis presented above ,",
    "this galaxy has been assumed to be one of two lensing galaxies . here , we investigate the single lensing galaxy scenario by determining whether a @xmath43 deflector is capable of producing @xmath44 image - splitting of a @xmath45 background source .",
    "single deflectors at low redshifts are uncommon , but nevertheless do exist .",
    "for example , mg1549 + 3047 ( @xmath46 ; @xcite ) and q2237 + 030 ( @xmath47 ; @xcite ) have low redshift lensing galaxies .",
    "however , hst imaging of mg1549 + 3047 @xcite and q2237 + 030 @xcite has also shown both to have highly luminous ( @xmath48-mag ) and therefore massive lensing galaxies . unfortunately , the resolution of the york et al .",
    "wht @xmath18-band image was insufficient to resolve the individual lensing galaxies .",
    "therefore , only an upper - limit can be placed on the luminosity of the nearby class b0631 + 519 lensing galaxy by i ) assuming it is responsible for all of the @xmath49-mag @xmath18-band emission , ii ) converting this emission to the rest - frame @xmath50-band magnitude , @xmath51 , using the galaxy colour differences and non - evolutionary @xmath52-correction , @xmath53 , of @xcite , and iii ) comparing with the luminosity of an @xmath54 galaxy @xcite .",
    "the absolute @xmath50-band magnitude , @xmath55 , was calculated using , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the luminosity distance .",
    "this was found to be @xmath58 which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath59 or @xmath60 . assuming that this galaxy is producing the @xmath61 image splitting of the distant @xmath45 galaxy results in a mass enclosed within the einstein radius of @xmath62 and a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath63 .",
    "however , it is clear from the spectrum of class b0631 + 519 that the @xmath45 galaxy is the dominant source of emission in @xmath18-band . therefore , this calculation provides a firm lower limit of the mass - to - light ratio of the low redshift galaxy .",
    "as the typical mass - to - light ratios of galaxy - scale deflectors are at most only a few tens of @xmath64 and there is currently no evidence that the lensing is cluster assisted , this arrangement appears to be unlikely .",
    "however , the possibility that the low redshift galaxy is a dark or dust enshrouded lens can not be ruled out at this stage .",
    "there is currently only one ` dark lens ' candidate , class b0827 + 525 @xcite , in the entire class gravitational lens sample , which along with class b0631 + 519 would result in a class ` dark lens ' fraction of @xmath65  per  cent .",
    "alternatively , the narrow emission line spectrum of the low redshift object is consistent with a nuclear starburst galaxy which has undergone or is currently undergoing a period of intense star - formation .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the under - luminous nature of the low redshift galaxy could be due to extinction caused by the presence of dust .",
    "further observations would need to be conducted to investigate this possibility . whether class b0631 + 519 is a gravitational lens with two lensing galaxies or",
    "a single dark / dusty lensing galaxy is unclear .",
    "however , it is most likely that the @xmath66 galaxy is the main deflector and the @xmath42 object is a dwarf star - forming galaxy which happens to be coincident along the line - of - sight .",
    "we have presented new optical spectra of four recently discovered gravitational lenses from class .",
    "the redshift of the background source in class b0128 + 437 was found to be @xmath0 and the lensing galaxy redshifts in class b0445 + 123 and class b0850 + 054 were found to be @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "interestingly , we discovered that class b0631 + 519 may have two lensing galaxies .",
    "one is a low luminosity galaxy at @xmath3 which has little effect on the lensing potential , and the other is the primary lensing galaxy at @xmath4 .",
    "the other possibility is that the low redshift galaxy is a dark / dust enshrouded gravitational lens .",
    "however , the scenario in which the main lens is at @xmath66 is currently favoured .",
    "we find the lensing galaxies in class b0445 + 123 and class b0631 + 519 ( @xmath5 ) to be early - type galaxies , with einstein radii of @xmath69 and @xmath70  kpc respectively .",
    "the lensing galaxy in class b0850 + 054 was found to be consistent with a late - type galaxy with an einstein radius of 1.6  @xmath71  kpc .",
    "for the redshift data presented in this paper to be useful for studying galaxy formation at high redshift or investigating the cosmological parameters , they must be coupled with the redshifts of the missing components .",
    "we have identified isolated emission lines in the class b0128 + 437 and class b0850 + 054 spectra which we hypothesised identifications for . however , these tentative identifications will only be confirmed by further observations .",
    "of the 22 gravitational lenses discovered by class , 17 have measured lensing galaxy redshifts and 12 have background source redshifts recorded .",
    "obtaining spectra of the remaining gravitational lenses with unknown source or lens redshifts is an essential step in the follow - up of the class gravitational lensing survey .",
    "to achieve this goal , further deep spectroscopic observations are required in the optical and near - infrared .",
