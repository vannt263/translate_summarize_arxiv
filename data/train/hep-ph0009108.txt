    "since the discovery of qcd , it has been emphasized @xcite that exotic mesons beyond the standard octet , exist as a consequence of the non - perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . among these states ,",
    "the @xmath5 meson is a _ peculiar _ pseudoscalar state , as it should contain a large gluon component ( the 1st well - established gluonium ! ) in its wave function for explaining why its mass is not degenerate with the one of the pion but only vanishes in the large @xmath10 limit ( solution of the so - called @xmath11 problem ) @xcite , though the @xmath5 likes to couple to @xmath12 mesons in its decay ( e.g. @xmath13 , ... ) .",
    "this peculiar feature has lead to certain confusion in the interpretation of its nature .",
    "even , at present , many physicists claim misleadingly that the @xmath5 is a @xmath12 state , from the conclusion based on the successful quark model prediction of its hadronic and @xmath14 couplings .",
    "this feature is not too surprising due to the manifestation of the strong ozi - violation for low mass state in this channel .",
    "however , the @xmath5 mass is lower than the direct calculation of the pseudoscalar glueball mass from qcd spectral sum rules ( qssr ) and lattice qcd ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this apparent discrepancy can be understood from the crucial rle played by the @xmath5 in the evaluation of the @xmath11 topological susceptiblity and of its slope @xcite . in the effective lagrangian approach , it has been expected since the pioneer work of nambu - lonasinio that an analogue of the pion of the non - linear @xmath1 model ( nl@xmath15 ) exists in the linear @xmath1 model ( l@xmath15 ) @xcite , but this l@xmath15 has not attracted too much attention in the past because it has been observed that the @xmath16 chiral symmetry of qcd is non - linearly realized ( this has made the success of the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) approach @xcite ) .",
    "it also occurs that the lagrangian of the @xmath17 is not unique such that no definite predictions from qcd first principles can be done .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of the resonances into the effective lagrangian is not completly settled @xcite .",
    "+ however , this analogy between the pion and the @xmath1 meson may not be very appropriate as they are particles associated to symmetries of a different nature ( @xmath18 for the pion and @xmath19 for the @xmath1 ) . instead , a comparison of the @xmath1 with the @xmath5 meson looks more valuable within a chiral @xmath20 lagrangian @xcite , as both particles are associated respectively to the u(1 ) axial and vector symmetries , where in terms of the quark and gluon fields , the corresponding qcd currents are respectively , the @xmath11 anomaly ( divergence of the singlet axial current ) : _ a^(x)&= &  g _",
    "^+_u , d , sm_q|q(i_5)q  ,   and the dilaton current : _ ^&= & ( _ s ) g_g^+1+_m(_s)_u , d , sm_q|qq  , which is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath21 .",
    "the sum over colour is understood ; @xmath22 ,   @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the quark , the gluon field strength and its dual ; @xmath25 is the light quark running mass ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the @xmath26-function and quark mass anomalous dimension .",
    "+ in this talk , we shall discuss the @xmath1 meson from this point of view of the analogy with the @xmath5-meson by using qcd spectral sum rules ( qssr )  la svz @xcite ( for a review , see e.g. : @xcite ) and some low - energy theorems based on ward identities .",
    "the discussions are based on the works in @xcite .. and/or gluonium nature of scalar states can also be found in e.g.@xcite . ]",
    "since its discovery in 79 , qssr has proved to be a powerful method for understanding the hadronic properties in terms of the fundamental qcd parameters such as the qcd coupling @xmath28 , the ( running ) quark masses and the quark and/or gluon qcd vacuum condensates .",
    "the description of the method has been often discussed in the literature , where a pedagogical introduction can be , for instance , found in the book @xcite . in practice ( like also the lattice ) , one starts the analysis from the two - point correlator : _",
    "h(q^2 ) i d^4x  e^iqx 0 j_h(x ) j_h(0)^0  , built from the hadronic local currents @xmath29 , which select some specific quantum numbers . however , unlike the lattice which evaluates the correlator in the minkowski space - time , one exploits , in the sum rule approaches , the analyticity property of the correlator which obeys the well - known kllen  lehmann dispersion relation : _ h ( q^2 ) = _ 0^   _ h(t )   + ... , where ... represent subtraction points , which are polynomials in the @xmath30-variable . in this way",
    ", the @xmath31 expresses in a clear way the _ duality _ between the integral involving the spectral function im@xmath32 ( which can be measured experimentally ) , and the full correlator @xmath33 .",
    "the latter can be calculated directly in the qcd euclidean space - time using perturbation theory ( provided that @xmath34 ( @xmath35 being the quark mass ) is much greater than @xmath36 ) , and the wilson expansion in terms of the increasing dimensions of the quark and/or gluon condensates which simulate the non - perturbative effects of qcd .",
    "using the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite , the two - point correlator reads : _",
    "h(q^2 ) _ d=0,2,4 , ...",
    "_ dim o = d c(q^2 , ) ( )  , where @xmath37 is an arbitrary scale that separates the long- and short - distance dynamics ; @xmath38 are the wilson coefficients calculable in perturbative qcd by means of feynman diagrams techniques ; @xmath39 are the quark and/or gluon condensates of dimension @xmath40 . in this paper",
    ", we work in the massless quark limit .",
    "then , one may expect the absence of the terms of dimension 2 due to gauge invariance .",
    "however , it has been emphasized recently @xcite that the resummation of the large order terms of the perturbative series , and the effects of the higher dimension condensates due e.g. to instantons , can be mimiced by the effect of a tachyonic gluon mass , which might be understood from the short distance linear part of the qcd potential . the strength of this short distance mass has been estimated from the @xmath41 data to be @xcite : @xmath42 which leads to the value of the square of the ( short distance ) string tension : @xmath43 ^ 2 $ ] in an ( unexpected ) good agreement with the lattice result @xcite of about @xmath44 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the strengths of the vacuum condensates having dimensions @xmath45 are also under good control : namely @xmath46 from pion pcac , @xmath47 gev@xmath48 from @xmath49 data @xcite and from the heavy quark mass - splittings @xcite , @xmath50 gev@xmath51 @xcite , and @xmath52 1.2 gev@xmath53 from dilute gaz instantons @xcite .",
    "the spectral function is often parametrized using the  nave \" duality ansatz :   _ h(t)2m_h^2nf_h^2 ( t - m_h^2)+  qcd  continuum \" ( t - t_c )  , which has been tested @xcite using @xmath54-decay data , to give a good description of the spectral integral in the sum rule analysis ; @xmath55 ( analogue to @xmath56 ) is the the hadron s coupling to the current ; @xmath57 is the dimension of the correlator , while @xmath58 is the qcd continuum s threshold .      among the different sum rules discussed in the literature within qcd @xcite ( finite energy sum rule ( fesr ) @xcite , @xmath59-like sum rules @xcite , ... )",
    ", we shall mainly be concerned here with : + @xmath60 the exponential laplace unsubtracted sum rule ( usr ) and its ratio : [ usr ] l_n ( ) = _ 0^ dt  t^n  ( -t )   _ h(t )  ,  r_n -  ,  ( n0 )  ; @xmath60 the subtracted sum rule ( ssr ) : [ ssr ] l_-1 ( ) = _ 0^  ( -t )   _ h(t ) + _ h(0 )  .",
    "the advantage of the laplace sum rules with respect to the previous dispersion relation is the presence of the exponential weight factor , which enhances the contribution of the lowest resonance and low - energy region accessible experimentally . for the qcd side ,",
    "this procedure has eliminated the ambiguity carried by subtraction constants , arbitrary polynomial in @xmath30 , and has improved the convergence of the ope by the presence of the factorial dumping factor for each condensates of given dimensions .",
    "the ratio of the sum rules is a useful quantity to work with , in the determination of the resonance mass , as it is equal to the meson mass squared , in the usual duality ansatz parametrization .",
    "as one can notice , there are  a priori \" two free external parameters @xmath61 in the analysis .",
    "the optimized result will be ( in principle ) insensitive to their variations . in some cases , the @xmath58-stability is not reached due to the too nave parametrization of the spectral function .",
    "one can either fixed the @xmath58-values by the help of fesr ( local duality ) or improve the parametrization of the spectral function by introducing threshold effects fixed by chiral perturbation theory , ... , in order to restore the @xmath58-stability of the results .",
    "the results discussed below satisfy these stability criteria .",
    "before discussing the specific scalar channel , let s present the situation of gluonia / glueball mass calculations as a guide for the forthcoming discussions .    .",
    "unmixed gluonia masses and decay constants from qssr @xcite compared with the lattice . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in addition to the pseudoscalar and scalar currents introduced previously , we shall deal with the tensor and 3-gluon currents ( standard notations):_=-g_^g_+g _  ,",

    "one can notice an excellent agreement between the usr and the lattice results , with the mass hierarchy : @xmath62 , expected from some qcd inequalities @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the whole story !",
    "indeed , one can notice that in the pseudoscalar channel , the predicted value of the mass of the @xmath63 is too high compared with the mass of the @xmath5 , which is not surprising for the reasons explained in the introduction .",
    "we shall see in the next section that the same phenomena occur for the scalar channel .",
    "using the mass and decay constant of the scalar gluonium @xmath65 in table 1 from the usr ( eq.[usr ] ) , into the ssr ( eq.[ssr ] ) sum rules , where @xcite @xmath66 , one can notice @xcite that one needs a low mass resonance @xmath64 for a consistency of the two sum rules .",
    "using , e.g. , @xmath67 gev , from the two sum rules .",
    "we give in the original papers a more complete analysis for different values of the @xmath1 mass ranging from 500 to 1 gev .",

    "<S> within the increasing experimental evidence of the existence of the @xmath0 scalar low mass and wide @xmath1 meson , we review the _ first _ analysis of its quark and gluon substructure from qcd spectral sum rules and some low - energy theorems . the present data favour equal components of @xmath2 and of @xmath3 in its wave function , which make the wide @xmath1 and the narrow @xmath4 as @xmath5-like particles . a coherent picture of the other @xmath0 scalar mesons spectra within this mixing scheme is shortly discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also expect the @xmath6 to be the lowest isovector @xmath7 state , and the @xmath8 its @xmath9 partner . </S>"
