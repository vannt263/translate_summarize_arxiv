    "the pion - photon transition @xmath2 ( see @xcite for a review ) is defined by the correlator of two electromagnetic currents @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pion - photon transition form factor ( tff ) with the photon momenta @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "this transition process was measured by the cello  @xcite , cleo  @xcite , babar  @xcite , and belle  @xcite collaborations for the kinematics @xmath9 ( the same also for the planed measurement by besiii  @xcite ) . for this kinematics , perturbative qcd factorization is reliable only in the leading - twist approximation , while higher twists are also important as shown in  @xcite . for @xmath10 ,",
    "one has to include the interaction of the ( quasi ) real photon at long distances @xmath11 . to this end , we apply  @xcite light cone sum rules ( lcsr)s @xcite that effectively account for long - distance effects of the real photon making use of quark - hadron duality in the vector channel and applying a dispersion relation in @xmath12 to get  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the effective threshold in the vector channel and @xmath15 is the borel parameter ( @xmath16 gev@xmath17 . the effect related to the small nonzero momentum @xmath12",
    "was recently discussed in the framework of lcsrs  @xcite , and also using monte carlo simulations  @xcite . here",
    ", we neglect this effect and apply the real - photon limit @xmath18 that can easily be taken in the lcsrs given by ( [ eq : lcsr.ff ] ) : @xmath19 .",
    "the spectral density has been calculated in qcd up to the level of the twist - six ( tw-6 ) term @xcite ( using similar notations for the other twists ) : @xmath20 where the various twist contributions are given in the form of a convolution of the hard parts with the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) of a given twist . at the same time , for the twist - two contribution we have the perturbative expansion @xmath21 \\otimes\\varphi^\\text{tw-2}_\\pi(x,\\mu^2)\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 . in our studies",
    "all calculated terms have been included and they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcsrterm ] as a chain of ovals each enclosing an area proportional to the absolute value of the corresponding contribution .",
    "the sum of all terms of each row gives its total contribution , as detailed in the accompanying table in this figure .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         with the asymptotic pion da at @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25  gev@xmath1 in table form and graphically ( shown only for @xmath26  gev@xmath1 ) .",
    "the blue color corresponds to negative terms , while the red one denotes the positive terms .",
    "[ fig : lcsrterm],scaledwidth=90.0% ]    as we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : lcsrterm ] , the twist - six contribution  @xcite and the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) term  @xcite proportional to the @xmath27-part have absolute values of similar size but opposite signs in the whole @xmath28-region .",
    "therefore , we consider their sum as a contribution to the theoretical uncertainties both for fitting the pion da and for estimating the pion tff for a given pion da model . all other terms are included into the central value of the tff : leading order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of twist - two @xcite ( corrected in  @xcite ) , and twist - four  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the applied lcsr approach contain the sum of the nnlo twist - two and twist - six contributions , a 20% variation of the twist - four coupling @xmath29  gev@xmath1  @xcite , and those uncertainties stemming from the pion da model .",
    "we consider the pion da in terms of the first two coefficients of the full gegenbauer expansion @xmath30 : @xmath31    \\ , .",

    "lepage ( erbl ) @xcite evolution equation to the nlo level  @xcite .",
    "the described lcsr - based techniques allow the computation of the tff for any pion da given in the form of a gegenbauer expansion . using lcsrs with pion das obtained in qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates  @xcite ,",
    "one obtains the predictions shown by a shaded ( green ) band in fig .",
    "[ fig : bmsvsdata ] in comparison with the available experimental data .",

    "[ fig : bmsvsdata ] , scaledwidth=65.0% ]    on the other hand , one can fit the pion da gegenbauer coefficients to the different data sets in order to obtain corresponding experimental constraints .",
    "this can also reveal the extent of the discrepancy among the various data sets . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d - regions ] , we present the confidence region of @xmath33 and @xmath34 given in the form of error ellipses derived from fitting different sets of data .",
    "best - fit values of the @xmath35-squared goodness of fit @xmath36 ( ndf = number of degrees of freedom ) are shown at the centers of the ellipses , while deviations between particular data sets are displayed on the sides of the triangle in units of one standard deviation ( 1@xmath37 ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig:2d - regions ] , we conclude that the inclusion of the babar data to those of cello&cleo leads to a 3@xmath38 shifting of the confidence region from the ( blue ) ellipse at the bottom on the right to the ( red ) solid - lined ellipse at the top on the left , accompanied by a significant increase of the @xmath35-squared goodness of fit value from 0.4 to 2 .",
    "the additional inclusion of the belle data plays no role in the two - parameter analyses ( dashed - dotted ( red ) ellipse ) . if we include to the cello&cleo data only the belle data ( ignoring the babar data ) , then the shifting of the confidence region is moderate ( 1.2@xmath38 ) , with a slight increase of the @xmath35-squared goodness of fit value from 0.4 to 0.6 ( dotted black ellipse ) .",
    "note that we considered the @xmath35-squared goodness of fit for the analyzed experiments , @xmath39 , as the sum of the individual @xmath35-squared goodness of fit values associated with each experiment .",
    "when the data strongly deviate from each other , this way of combining data could be inefficient for extracting the confidence region of the fitting parameters , though it is still good for identifying and rating this deviation .    )",
    "fits based on three data sets : first - cleo , cello @xcite ( solid ( blue ) ellipse at the right bottom ) ; second - cleo , cello , and babar @xcite ( solid ( red ) ellipse at the left top ) ; third - cleo , cello , and belle @xcite ( dotted ellipse at the center ) .",
    "best fit values of the @xmath35-squared goodness of fit @xmath36 are shown at the apexes of a triangle .",
    "on its sides we display the discrepancy among the data sets in terms of a standard deviation ( 1@xmath37 ) .",
    "the area of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 values allowed by qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates from @xcite is indicated by a slanted ( green ) rectangle .",
    "[ fig:2d - regions ] , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig:2d - regions ] , we conclude that the babar data deviate from the other data sets at the 3@xmath38 level and can not be satisfied by pion das based on models with only two gegenbauer coefficients  unlike all other data sets  and hence they require ( at least ) a sizable coefficient @xmath40 or still higher coefficients .",
    "it is not a trivial matter that qcd has come to use collinear factorization to describe basic exclusive processes , like the pion - photon transition form factor .",
    "this scheme has been challenged by the babar data because they indicate an auxetic behavior at @xmath41  gev@xmath1 that can not be uniquely described by a known qcd mechanism .",
    "therefore , the belle data , which do not replicate this increase of the scaled pion - photon transition form factor , may help restoring the confidence to the standard qcd scheme , though a definitive answer requires more accurate data in the high-@xmath28 range .",
