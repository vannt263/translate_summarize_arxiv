    "there is presently a lot of interest in using linear alkylbenzene ( lab ) as a scintillator solvent for neutrino experiments ( _ e.g. _ sno , lena , reno and daya bay @xcite ) .",
    "first proposed as a scintillator by m. chen , this organic liquid has the advantages of low toxicity , good light yield , high flash - point and long attenuation length .",
    "furthermore , it is compatible with acrylic , a material that is frequently used to build the scintillator containment vessel .    to understand the propagation of light and",
    "reconstruct events in these experiments , and to accurately calculate the cherenkov light production , it is imperative to know the refractive index of the liquid scintillator as a function of wavelength",
    ". currently , our knowledge of the refractive index of lab - based scintillators is limited to the optical region .",
    "recently , the reno collaboration reported a measurement of the refractive index of lab at six wavelengths in the interval @xmath3 nm , using the mininum deviation technique @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe a measurement of the real component of the refractive index , @xmath4 , of two lab - based scintillators , to the nearest @xmath0 at 500 points from 210 to 1000 nm , using an ellipsometric method @xcite .",
    "these two scintillators were : lab with 3 g / l of 2,5-diphenyloxazole ( ppo ) , and lab - ppo loaded with 0.094 % nd by weight .",
    "we also report on a measurement of @xmath4 for ej-301 scintillator @xcite , which is equivalent to the very commonly - used ne-213 and bc-501a scintillators .",
    "as far as we know , the dispersion of ne-213 has not been measured down to the uv region .",
    "the use of ellipsometers for measuring the refractive indices of liquids is convenient , but not widespread . because of challenges brought about by surface vibrations , evaporation and difficulties in controlling the temperature of the liquid medium , the ellipsometric method is not expected to be as competitive as the minimum deviation technique for precision refractive index measurements .",
    "however , measurements that are accurate to the third decimal place are possible . in this work",
    ", we adopted the simplest ellipsometric configuration , in which polarized light reflects off an infinitely deep layer of liquid .",
    "this is described below .      .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=291 ]    consider polarized light incident on the interface between two media , both of which are infinite and homogeneous ( figure [ figure : reflectionfigures](a ) ) .",
    "after reflection , there is a change in polarization that is dependent on the incident angle , the refractive indices of the two media , as well as the initial polarization state .",
    "the ellipsometer measures the change in polarization in terms of two parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the reflection coefficients of the electric field components parallel ( @xmath9 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath10 ) to the plane of incidence , the ellipsometric parameters are given by : @xmath11 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are expressed in terms of the complex refractive indices of media 1 and 2 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , and the angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( figure [ figure : reflectionfigures](a ) ) by fresnel s equations . combining fresnel s equations and snell s law with equation [ equation : ellipsometer ] , and separating real and imaginary components , one gets @xcite : @xmath16=x\\ ] ] @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively , the real components of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and @xmath20 is the imaginary component of @xmath13 . given @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath14 and @xmath18",
    ", one can therefore solve for @xmath19 and @xmath20 separately : @xmath21 in our case , medium 1 is air , and medium 2 is the liquid scintillator , whose real refractive index component ( @xmath19 ) is to be measured .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath20 is weak , since the measurement is made on the reflected , and not the transmitted light component , which conveys most of the information on attenuation in medium 2 .",
    "for equations [ equation : n21 ] and [ equation : n22 ] to be valid , one must have : ( 1 ) an ideal interface , and ( 2 ) an infinitely deep medium 2 ( so that no interference occurs with light reflected off the bottom of medium 2 ) . to emulate a deep container with a flat liquid surface",

    "@xcite : a few drops of liquid were allowed to spread into a thin film , on a sandblast - frosted microscope glass slide ( figure [ figure : reflectionfigures ] ( b ) ) .",
    "measurements were then made with the light reflected specularly off the upper surface of the liquid film .",
    "the transmitted component was diffusely reflected off the frosted glass and did not affect the results .",
    "the slides , as well as all other glassware used in this work , were first cleaned in an ultrasound bath .",
    "data was taken at five values of @xmath14 , namely @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the experiment was performed at room temperature ( 25@xmath24 c ) with a variable - angle woollam m2000 ellipsometer , fitted with a xe lamp . excluding alignment procedures , a spectral scan at one angle typically took around 30 s.",
    "results for lab - ppo are shown in figure [ figure : labresults](a ) .",
    "the measurements at the five different angles agree within around @xmath0 over 2001000 nm .",
    "the solid curve is the average from the five angles , while the shaded region shows the standard deviation . shown in the circle markers are measurements from reno @xcite , obtained using the mininum deviation technique .",
