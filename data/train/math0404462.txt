    "the use of the conserved quantities of a hamiltonian flow in the study of the stability of its solutions is a venerable topic that goes back to lagrange and dirichlet . in the past decades these ideas",
    "have been adapted to various setups : equilibria in poisson systems  @xcite , relative equilibria  @xcite and periodic and relative periodic orbits  @xcite of symmetric hamiltonian systems , relative equilibria of symmetric lagrangian systems  @xcite , and symmetric constrained systems  @xcite , to list a few .",
    "all these results provide sufficient conditions for the solution in question to be stable .",
    "in this paper we will focus on the stability of the equilibria of poisson dynamical systems .",
    "the main tools that one finds in the literature concerning this case are the energy - casimir method and the topological stability methods introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the energy - casimir method consists in finding a combination of conserved quantities by the hamiltonian flow , typically the energy and the casimir functions , that exhibits a critical point at the equilibrium with definite hessian .",
    "since the dynamics of the system is confined to the level sets of this combination and , by the morse lemma , in a coordinate chart about the equilibrium these level sets are diffeomorphic to spheres centered at the equilibrium , stability follows .",
    "the topological methods in  @xcite rely on a much more subtle confinement of the flow that takes advantage not only of its conservation laws but also of the topological properties of the foliation of the poisson manifold by its symplectic leaves .",
    "energy confinement is a very important tool in the symplectic hamiltonian context due to the absence of asymptotically stable behavior .",
    "energy methods are , to this day , the only general way to prove stability in more than two degrees of freedom .",
    "the conservation of the phase space volume by the flow imposed by liouville s theorem does not necessarily hold in the poisson category .",
    "the first main result of this paper , contained in theorem  [ ultimate stability in poisson ] , adapts the standard energy - casimir method to this situation to allow the use of functions that are not necessarily conserved by the flow but that can still be used to conclude a certain kind of asymptotic stability via the standard lyapunov stability theorem .",
    "this newly introduced notion of stability implies the standard lyapunov stability and will be referred to as * _ _ * weak asymptotic stability .",
    "theorem  [ ultimate stability in poisson ] improves a previous version of the energy - casimir method ( see  @xcite or corollary 4.11 in  @xcite ) where the conserved quantities confining the flow are also used to shrink the space on which one checks the definiteness of the hessian .",
    "theorem  [ ultimate stability in poisson ] shows that _ any _ conserved quantity can be used to shrink this space even when that conserved quantity is not involved in the confinement of the flow .",
    "theorem  [ subcasimir stability ] is the second main result of this paper .",
    "it adapts the stability condition in theorem  [ ultimate stability in poisson ] to equilibria of poisson systems obtained by a certain reduction procedure that uses ideals in the poisson algebra of the functions on the manifold .",
    "our interest is twofold .",
    "first , there are some constrained mechanical systems that can be described by reducing in this sense a bigger ( unconstrained ) system .",
    "moreover , the weakened kind of stability that theorem  [ subcasimir stability ] allows us to conclude , coincides with the physically relevant notion of stability in those situations , that is , the one that describes the system when subjected to perturbations compatible with the constraints .",
    "we illustrate this point with a couple of examples in section  [ examples ] : a light chaplygin sleigh on a cylinder and two coupled spinning wheels .",
    "second , there are cases when there are not enough conserved quantities to apply theorem  [ ultimate stability in poisson ] but , nevertheless , the system can be reduced around the equilibrium and then the reduced system has enough conserved quantities to use the theorem .",
    "theorem  [ subcasimir stability ] explains the meaning of having this _ reduced _ kind of stability .",
    "in particular , it shows the role of sub - casimir functions in stability computations .",
    "the last section of the paper is dedicated to the study of the relation between the topological stability methods in  @xcite with a generalized version of the energy - casimir method that we propose in the text based on the use of local continuous casimir functions of the poisson manifold . to be more explicit ,",
    "the stability criteria in  @xcite are stated in terms of a set that , roughly speaking , measures how far the space of symplectic leaves of a poisson manifold is from being a hausdorff topological space .",
    "the general question that we try to answer is under what circumstances this set can be characterized as the intersection of level sets of local continuous casimirs .",
    "since this is not true in general , we provide two sufficient conditions that are related to certain idempotency of the set in  @xcite and to the possibility of separating regular symplectic leaves by using continuous casimirs .",
    "the natural category where these questions are posed is that of generalized foliated manifolds ; this is the context in which we have formulated the main results in this section and where we have obtained the poisson case as a byproduct , considering it as a manifold foliated by its symplectic leaves .    before we start with the core of the paper we quickly review in a few paragraphs the basic notions and terminology of poisson manifolds and generalized foliations that we will use throughout the paper .",
