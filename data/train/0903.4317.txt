    "while examining an nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) image @xcite of the region surrounding the galactic supernova remnant ( 63.7)+(1.1 ) , an arc of extended emission was noticed near ra@xmath8 , dec@xmath9 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : nvss ] ) .",
    "as it resembles part of a ring and lies in the galactic plane , it was identified as a possible supernova remnant ( snr ) . also noticed this structure in canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ; @xcite ) data with similar sensitivity to but poorer resolution than the nvss data , and proposed it as a possible snr .",
    "it has now been observed with the vla and the newly commissioned arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ; see @xcite ) .",
    "these observations are described in section 2 , and calibration and data reduction in section 3 .",
    "results are presented in section [ section : results ] , and we analyse and discuss all available data in section [ section : discussion ] , confirming ( 64.5)+(0.9 ) as a new galactic snr .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for both the ring and the near - central emission we fit power - law spectra .",
    "we define @xmath2 such that flux density @xmath3 varies with frequency @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "spectra were fitted to these data using a gaussian likelihood function sampled by a markov chain monte carlo technique .",
    "this method copes with asymmetric errors in @xmath10 across the frequency channels and provides an error estimate on the spectral index directly from the posterior distribution .    using the vla 1.43ghz and ami measurements of the flux density of the ring",
    ", we calculate that it has a spectrum with @xmath1 .",
    "the structure and spectral index identify the shell source ( 64.5)+(0.9 ) as a shell snr .",
    "the surface brightness of the snr at 1ghz is @xmath11w  m@xmath12hz@xmath13sr@xmath13 , which is faint for known snrs ( in the faintest 10 per cent of identified snrs - see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this relatively low surface brightness suggests that the remnant is old , but on the other hand , its highly circular shell suggests it is young .",
    "suggest a possible distance of 11kpc , based on possibly related hi features , at which it would have a diameter of @xmath1426pc .",
    "this is not the first snr visible in nvss data which has been overlooked ( see e.g. ( 353.9)-(2.0 ) identified by @xcite ) .",
    "fitting a spectrum to the data in table  [ tab : centreflux ] , we find that the central emission has a steep spectrum with @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : centre_flux ] ) .",
    "this emission is of interest , because of both its apparent position relative to the ring and its structure",
    ". it could be a background , unrelated , extragalactic source , or a galactic source that may or may not be related to the shell remnant .",
    "first we consider a source at redshift @xmath15 around 0.1 .",
    "then its angular size of around 1 implies a physical size d of 100kpc and its luminosity @xmath16 is around @xmath17whz@xmath13sr@xmath13 ( taking h@xmath18 = 72kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 ) .",
    "these values are typical of fr - i @xcite twin - jet or tail radio sources powered by jet - producing machines .",
    "however the emission is not reminiscent of known twin - jets or tails  particularly at 8ghz  and the lack of spectral steepening from 1.43 to 18ghz  also tells against it being this type of radio source .",
    "a substantially higher redshift for the emission appears ruled out : its structure is very difficult to reconcile with that of a powerful radio source of whatever physical size or orientation , and the emission shows no sign of the synchrotron or inverse - compton losses associated with the extended regions of powerful sources .    `",
    "halo ' emission from certain galaxy clusters might resemble the shape of the near - central emission .",
    "however , ` halo ' emission has an extremely steep radio spectrum ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining extragalactic possibility would seem to be synchrotron emission from a nearby system of interacting galaxies . at a redshift @xmath190.02",
    ", its angular size of around 1implies a physical size @xmath20 of 20kpc and its flux density @xmath21 of 17.1mjy implies a luminosity @xmath22 of @xmath23whz@xmath13sr@xmath13 thus , this source s angular size , flux density and structure are consistent with synchrotron emission from two or three interacting galaxies at @xmath15 of around 0.01  0.05",
    ".    however , from nvss source counts , we estimate at 15 per cent the probability of a source of @xmath2417mjy appearing to lie inside the shell of the snr purely by chance .",
    "thus the probability of _ any _ extragalactic radio source of this flux density and of such large angular extent , lying within one arcminute of the centre , is minimal .    turning to possible galactic sources of emission for the near - central source",
    ", chance assocation along the line - of - sight with thermal galactic sources such as hii regions is excluded both by the non - thermal radio spectrum of the central source , and its lack of infra - red emission .",
    "the location of the extended emission near the centre of the shell suggests that ( 64.5)+(0.9 ) may be a ` composite ' snr , i.e.  a shell containing a central pulsar wind nebula ( pwn )  for example , see ( 328.1)-(1.8 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the radio spectral index of @xmath25 for the central source is considerably larger than expected , since pulsar wind nebulae usually have relatively flat spectral indices at gigahertz frequencies ( e.g.  @xcite ) . if the central source is a pulsar wind nebula associated with ( 64.5)+(0.9 ) , then it requires a spectral break at below 1.4  ghz , which would be unusual",
    ". a low frequency spectral break , at about 1.3  ghz  three times lower than for any other pwn  has been identified in da  495 ( @xmath26(65.7)+(1.2 ) , kothes et al . ) .",
    "da  495 is thought to be rather old ( @xmath27  years ) , whereas the highly circular nature of the shell of ( 64.5)+(0.9 ) suggests it is relatively young . to identify the nature of this object and fully constrain its association with the remnant , hi absorption - line observations are vital .",
    "follow - up obervations of an arc of emission seen in nvss and cgps data have been made at frequencies from 1.4 to 18ghz .",
    "we draw the following conclusions from our observations :",
    "we thank the staff of the mullard radio astronomy observatory for their invaluable assistance in the commissioning and operation of ami , which is supported by cambridge university and the stfc .",
    "mld , tmof , crg , nhw and tws acknowledge the support of pparc / stfc studentships ."
