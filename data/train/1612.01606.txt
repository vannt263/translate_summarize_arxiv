    "ecological networks are well known to exhibit a number of structural features associated with their interaction patterns ( 1,2,3 ) .",
    "those include , in particular : ( a ) small world structure ( 4 ) where two given species are separated by a small number of links from any other species in the web ( 5,6,7 ) , ( b ) heterogeneous distributions of connections ( 1,8 ) where the number of links between a given species and other species in the web can vary widely ; ( c ) modular organisation ( 7,9 ) implying that subsets of species exhibit more connections among them than with the rest of the network and ( d ) nestedness ( 10 ) , where specialists interact with a subset of the whole set of species that generalists interact with .",
    "the presence of some of these traits has important implications for the persistence and reliability of diverse ecosystems . as an example , it was shown earlier that the architecture of ecological food webs is consistent with the `` robust - but - fragile '' metaphor of complex networks : these webs are robust against the removal ( extinction ) of a random species but the removal of certain species can lead to a cascade of extinctions due to the existing chains of species dependencies ( 1 , 11 ) .",
    "mutualistic networks describe species interactions across two adjacent trophic levels ( of consumers and their resources ) , such as flowers and the insects that feed on and pollinate them .",
    "the bipartite graphs that these interactions form are considered the building blocks of biodiversity ( 12 ) and they are often significantly nested ( 13 ) . yet",
    "while the robustness of ecological networks might in large part be due to the presence of such structure , what is much less clear is from where or what that structure arises .",
    "following an adaptationist view of naturally evolved systems , it has been argued that the presence of these properties , nestedness in particular , is a consequence of some underlying selection process that reduces competition relative to the benefits of facilitation and hence increases biodiversity and food web persistence or feasibility ( 3 , 14 , 15 ) , although this has been challenged ( 16 ) .",
    "the main arguments provided to support this view are grounded in the use of multispecies dynamical systems , based on generalised lotka - volterra equations with different functional responses .",
    "several recent papers have questioned the conclusion that nestedness has resulted from selection pressures ( 17 ) favouring higher biodiversity . instead , it has been suggested that nestedness is likely to be a consequence ( instead of a causative property ) of biodiversity , in particular of the heterogeneous distributions of connections .",
    "other studies seem to support this view , where a structural pattern is incorrectly pointed to as a causal agent for a given functional trait and the biological details of the system under consideration . in this context ,",
    "previous work concerning the evolution of complex biological and artificial networks suggest that many architectural patterns displayed by these graphs are an inevitable byproduct of the way they are constructed ( 18 ) .",
    "this is in fact the consequence of processes involving network growth through duplication and rewiring ( 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ) .",
    "specifically , evolution often proceeds by tinkering from available components ( 24 , 25 ) and a network ( including the proteome , metabolic networks and even technological graphs ) resulting from a process of copy and further modification is likely to display complex features .",
    "simple models involving no functionality or population dynamics can develop small world or scale - free webs , which can be modular ( 26 ) despite the apparently well established idea that modularity is an evolved , functionally relevant trait .",
    "if this were the case for mutualistic webs , their invariant features ( 27 ) would be a consequence of universal properties of the graphs and their growth rules , closer to the idea of _ universality _ ( 28 , 29 ) .",
    "when this occurs , very simple , toy models are capable of accounting for the global features exhibited by the system .",
    "the key lesson of the studies mentioned above is that , when dealing with complex biological networks , it is important to consider the generative rules responsible for their growth and change . some of these very ubiquitous patterns might be a byproduct of these rules , although they might be relevant or even functionally important afterwards .",
    "the emergent patterns can thus be _ evolutionary spandrels _ , i.e. , phenotypic characteristic that evolved as a side effect of a true adaptation ( 30,31 ) . despite some criticisms related to the appropriateness of the architectural analogy ( 32 ) the key concept of a non - adaptive structural patterns stands .",
    "an example of spandrel is provided by the distribution of network motifs in cellular networks ( 33 ) where it has been shown that the conserved , uneven distribution of some small subgraphs can be explained by means of non - functional models .",
    "we can define evolutionary spandrels as structures that : ( i ) are the byproduct of building rules ; ( ii ) have intrinsic , well - defined , non - random features ; and ( iii ) their structure reveals some of the underlying rules of construction ( 33 ) .     or the @xmath0 sets ( left and right sequences , respectively ) . each time a new species is added ( b ) the daughter inherits all its interactions . afterwards , they experience a divergence ( c ) affecting the weights and links . ]    here we aim to show that nestedness , as well as other key statistical features of mutualistic webs , can be recovered as a byproduct of the generative rules associated with the creation of diversity through speciation - divergence dynamics with no consideration of the underlying population dynamics .",
    "this approach ignores the ecological time scale ( and thus all factors associated to standard stability criteria ) by considering instead a scenario where speciation and diversification that takes place over very long ( evolutionary ) time scales .",
    "such kind of model has been used to model macroevolutionary dynamics using both adaptive dynamics on fitness landscapes as well as models of network growth and extinction ( 34,35,36,37,38,39,40 ) .",
    "these class of models has been able to give insight into the large - scale evolution of ecological networks ( 41 , 42 and references therein ) .",
    "a crucial point of using these models is that we can explore the outcome of evolutionary rules that drive the structural patterns of connectivity beyond the ecological time scale .",
    "the approach taken here makes some strong assumptions .",
    "one is that species are either present or absent , with no role to be played by population size or other species - specific traits .",
    "secondly , interactions are introduced as weighted links .",
    "the values of these links will evolve in time following very simple rules .",
    "the large - scale dynamics of our system is obtained by a combination of two processes that obviously occur over evolutionary time scales : new species are generated from old ones through speciation and coevolution and external ( either environmental or stochastic ) factors modify the presence and strength of the interactions .",
    "our model assumes a bipartite graph @xmath1 involving two subsets @xmath2 and @xmath3 that correspond to the animals and plants , respectively , at a given evolutionary time step t. these species are linked ( figure 1 ) provided that a mutualistic relationship exists .",
    "here we consider the effect of animals on plants , weighted through a matrix @xmath4 that indicates the strength of the interaction between both partners .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of the number of dependencies existing between the given pair ( in one direction ) .",
    "the evolutionary dynamics are defined by a simple set of rules : + * speciation * : we choose a given species @xmath5 or @xmath6 and create a speciation event .",
    "the new species inherits exactly the same list of links from its parent species .",
    "if @xmath7 indicates the newly created species , then we have @xmath8 .",
    "+ * divergence * : we redistribute the weights between parent and daugther species .",
    "a random number @xmath9 is generated and each pair of links @xmath10 is updated to a new pair @xmath11 .",
    "additionally , for each link , we introduce , with a given probability @xmath12 , a weight change , i. e. , we have a new value @xmath13 with @xmath14 being a small random number between zero and @xmath15 . here",
    "the parameter @xmath15 will weight how fast evolutionary changes occur at the level of single ecological links .",
    "if @xmath16 falls below a threshold @xmath17 , it is removed .",
    "finally , a maximum input weight is allowed for all plants . specifically , if the sum @xmath18 over all animals acting on the plant @xmath6 is larger than one , the change is not accepted .",
    "a symmetric rule is used to constraint the links in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "because of the type of dynamics defined by the previous rules , species become extinct when no mutual support is present ( i. e. if @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is the simplest way of defining the mutual cooperation among species .",
    "the model successfully generates networks with all the reported statistical patterns displayed by empirical webs . in figure 2a - b",
    "we show an example of a graph obtained from our rules , starting from an initial condition with two species at each level , connected to each other with a small weight @xmath21 .",
    "the webs are heterogeneous , showing broad scale distributions of connections ( figure 2c ) .",
    "specifically , if @xmath22 and @xmath23 indicate the number of links ( or degree ) of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , the frequency of species having a given number of links @xmath24 will be indicated by @xmath25 .",
    "it has been found that for mutualistic webs the appropriate form of these distributions is ( 27 ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the exponent that indicates how rapidly the distribution falls at small @xmath24 and @xmath28 a cut - off that effectively limits the spread of the distribution ( 43 ) .",
    "the larger @xmath28 the more flat is the distribution and the more common the presence of highly - connected species . in figure 2c",
    "we represent the cumulative degree distribution @xmath29 defined as : @xmath30 this distribution allows to smooth out the fluctuations and to define better estimates of the two characteristic parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "our model correctly predicts the broad distribution scenario , thus indicating that heterogeneity is a consequence of amplification - divergence phenomena , consistently with previous studies ( 19 ) but in this case applied to a bipartite system .",
    "another property of the network that can be easily determined is the aggregated _ strength _ of the nodes , defined as the sum of all the dependencies in both directions i. e. @xmath31 where @xmath32 indicates the number of interactions with other species .",
    "the use of a weighted network provides relevant information about its local and global organisation ( 44,45,46 ) and was early identified as an essential feature of mutualistic interactions ( 47 ) . in general , a scaling law relates strength and degree , namely @xmath33 where the exponent @xmath34 will establish the nature of the correlation . for a randomly distributed set of weights",
    ", it can be shown that a linear relation ( @xmath35 ) exists . however ,",
    "if the importance of a given node in the network is lower than predicted by its degree , then we would observe @xmath36 .",
    "in mutualistic webs , it has been shown that a superlinear behaviour is found , i. e. @xmath37 , indicating that species with many connections tend to display stronger interactions than the average .",
    "this is the case of real webs and also occurs in our model , as displayed in figure 2d . in our simulated system",
    ", we have @xmath38 which is also close to measured data ( 45 ) .",
    "the previous patterns of network organisation reveal that some key statistical regularities found in mutualistic webs can be obtained from our minimalistic assumptions .",
    "these results are the first indication that the large - scale organisation of mutualistic webs could be a side effect of the amplification dynamics associated to the copy - and - divergence dynamics associated to the rules considered here .",
    "what about nestedness ? is this property also an emergent phenomenon resulting from evolutionary dynamics , decoupled from the underlying ecological dynamics ?",
    "in this section , we study the nestedness property associated our model .",
    "we show that our model exhibits nestedness without any additional stability requirement . a quantitative ( weighted ) approach to nestedness ( unlike binary measures ) takes into account species abundances and interaction frequencies .    a bipartite network @xmath39 has two disjoint sets of nodes @xmath40 and @xmath0 representing animals and plants , respectively .",
    "let @xmath41 be the number of animal species and @xmath42 be the number of plant species , i.e. , the total number of species in our system is @xmath43 .",
    "now , assume that animals are indexed @xmath44 and plants are labeled @xmath45 .",
    "the matrix of mutualistic interactions @xmath46 $ ] has a block off - diagonal form like this : @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the all - zero matrix that reflects the bipartite constraint , i.e. , there are no interactions between any pair of alike species . the so - called _ bipartiteness _",
    "function @xmath49 indicates @xmath50 node type , e.g. , where the vertex belongs to one type ( @xmath51 = 0 ) or the other type ( @xmath51 = 1 ) . using this notation , bipartite edges @xmath52 must satisfy @xmath53 = 1 .",
    "edges in a nested network are organised in a way that specialists interact with subset of the species whom generalists interact with .",
    "this nested pattern can be detected in the specific arrangement of present and absent interactions in bipartite networks .",
    "recently , this nestedness definition was extended to quantitative networks using spectral graph theory .",
    "it can be shown that the largest eigenvalue of bipartite networks determines nestedness ( 16 ) .",
    "this is a robust measurement of nestedness because its invariance to the sorting of rows and columns in the matrix .",
    "first , we define the @xmath54 incidence matrix @xmath55 $ ] : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we can interpret this bipartite matrix as the average interaction frequency between a pair of ( animal , plant ) after discarding link direction . because @xmath59 is a symmetric matrix , all its eigenvalues are real and distributed symmetrically around 0 .",
    "the spectral radius @xmath60 ( or dominant eigenvallue ) is the largest eigenvalue associated to the matrix @xmath59 and it represents a natural measurement of nestedness : large values of @xmath60 correspond to highly nested matrices .",
    "nestedness is a relative value that depends on the size ( number of species @xmath61 ) and fill ( density of interactions ) of the bipartite matrix @xmath59 . in order to assess its relevance , we compare the observed value of nestedness in the model with an ensemble of random matrices with similar properties ( 48 , 49 ) . here , we use the null model proposed by ( 16 ) , which keeps the structural features of the network while swapping the order of weighted links ( so - called binary shuffle in ( 49 ) ) .",
    "we assess the significance of empirical nestedness with the z - score :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the average value and the standard deviation of the network measure in a random ensemble , respectively . here",
    ", we consider that mutualistic networks are significantly nested whenever the corresponding @xmath65 ( i.e. , @xmath66 using the z - test ) .     on the structural patterns exhibited by mutualistic model networks : ( a )",
    "mean connectance decays with faster evolutionary rates , ( b ) nestedness is stable for wide range of parameters and ( c ) it correlates with network strength , ( d ) statistical signficance of the nestedness drops for high evolutionary rate , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "here we have used link probability @xmath68 $ ] and tuned @xmath15 over several orders of magnitude .",
    "overall , these plots comprise 600 random samples taken uniformly from the phase space @xmath69 . ]",
    "what is the impact of parametric changes on the statistical properties of these webs ?",
    "a systematic exploration reveals that the previous conclusions are robust .",
    "the main parameter associated to our model is @xmath15 , which provides a measure of the allowed speed of network changes through evolutionary time .",
    "we have explored the impact of this parameter on the connectance , mean network strength and spectral radius and nested organisation of these webs ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "our model predicts highly significant nestedness for a wide range of parameters , i.e. , when @xmath70 . on the other hand",
    ", the grey region in figure 4d corresponds to distributions of spectral radius scores in an ensemble of random matrices .",
    "the results described here support the hypothesis that and evolutionary - scale , minimal model generates highly nested bipartite networks in a wide range of scenarios .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a very simple model of large scale evolution of mutualistic webs .",
    "it includes the most elemental requirements associated to the measurable web properties .",
    "it ignores all details except minimal components related to the creation of new species through speciation and the change ( under constraints ) of weights over evolutionary time . despite its simplicity , the model is capable of consistently reproducing several well known structural patterns of organisation , suggesting that the generative rules responsible for network growth largely determine the presence of universal traits in empirical systems . the model incorporates a restriction to the total amount of inputs received and the persistence of species is guaranteed provided that a link exists between this species and at least one mutualistic partner .",
    "generative models of network structure are seldom rare mutualistic networks in comparison with other ecological networks , e.g. antagonistic ones .",
    "the model presented here is not the only one trying to explain the emergence of complex mutualistic networks .",
    "in ( 50 ) the authors showed that nestedness and heterogeneous degree distributions emerge from an optimization principle that maximizes species abundances .",
    "their model , however , works over ecological time - scales , while the question we asked here is to what extent simple evolutionary models can account for observed structural patterns . in this respect ,",
    "nuismer et al ( 2013 ) developed a quantitative genetic model that allows inference of network structure over evolutionary time.their model was far more complex that the one presented here , but they only found that emerging networks were more nested than their random counterparts under very restrictive conditions : species interactions should be mediated by phenotype differences and coevolutionary selection should be weak . in the remaining cases , resulting networks were either not nested or anti - nested .",
    "duplication - rewiring models are known to indirectly incorporate a preferential attachment rule .",
    "this rule is known to generate heterogeneous , sometimes long - tailed degree distributions ( 51 ) . once heterogeneous distributions arise , other features can come `` for free '' : nestedness in particular has been shown to be largely a consequence of broad connectivities ( 52 , 53 ) .",
    "our model incorporates evolutionary rules of speciation and drift that naturally provide a mechanism to explain the properties found in mutualistic webs . since our model",
    "does not include the population size associated to each species nor the nonlinear dynamics of ecological interactions , our results suggest that there is no need to assume that the ecological scale plays a major role in shaping mutualistic webs .",
    "instead , the universal constraints associated to the evolutionary unfolding of these webs would lead to the observed invariant properties .",
