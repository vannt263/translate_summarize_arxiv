    "h ii regions have been studied quite extensively in recent years on account of their close association with star formation .",
    "there seems to be two modes of star formation associated with h ii regions depending on the initial density distribution of the natal molecular cloud .",
    "one is the cluster mode which gives birth to a rich open clusters and the other is the dispersed mode which forms only loose clusters or aggregates of stars .",
    "presumably , the former takes place in centrally condensed , massive clouds , whereas the latter occurs in clumpy , dispersed clouds ( see e.g. , ogura 2006 ) .",
    "these clusters / aggregates of stars emerging from their natal clouds can be the laboratories to address some of the fundamental questions of star formation .",
    "trends in their evolutionary states and spatial distribution can help distinguish between various star formation scenarios such as spontaneous or triggered star formation .",
    "triggered star formation is a complex process and makes an interesting and important topic of star formation .",
    "the formation of massive stars feeds energy back into the nearby environments , irradiating , heating and compressing the remain of the natal molecular cloud .",
    "this feedback can have either destructive or constructive effects , but it is not clear which dominates in a given cloud or overall in a galaxy .",
    "many examples exist in our galaxy as well as in other galaxies where spatial distributions of young stellar objects ( ysos ) and their ages suggest for triggered star formation ( see e.g. walborn et al .",

    "the ngc 281 region provides an excellent laboratory for studying in detail star formation through the interaction of high mass stars with their surrounding cloud .",

    "2002 , 2003 ) , and the subsequent , triggered sequential and ongoing star formation on a smaller scale ( @xmath11 - 10 pc ) ; the latter is taking place in an adjoining molecular cloud ( ngc 281 west ) probably through an interaction with an hii region ( the ngc 281 nebula ) excited by the first generation ob stars ( elmegreen & lada 1978 ; megeath & wilson 1997 ; sato et al .",

    "the southwestern quadrant of the ngc 281 nebula is obscured by the adjoining molecular cloud ngc 281 west .",
    "ongoing star formation in ngc 281 west is indicated by the presence of h@xmath15o maser emission and iras sources within this cloud near its clumpy interface between the hii region .",
    "this star formation may have been triggered by the interaction of the molecular cloud with the hii region ( elmegreen & lada 1978 ; megeath & wilson 1997 ) .",
    "the ngc 281 molecular cloud complex was mapped both in @xmath18co ( j=1 - 0 ) and @xmath19co ( j=1 - 0 ) emission lines by lee & jung ( 2003 ) .",
    "the central radial velocity of the ngc 281 west molecular cloud , @xmath20 = 31 kms@xmath21 ( lee & jung 2003 ) agrees well with that of the h@xmath15o maser emission in the cloud ( sato et al .",

    "though both low - mass and high - mass star - forming regions can be studied at variety of wavelengths ranging from radio waves to x - rays , however most of the present knowledge about the hii region / open cluster ngc 281 has been inferred from studies outside the optical region .",

    "a comparison of the morphology of the molecular cloud as observed in c@xmath196o ( 2 - 1 ) ( megeath & wilson 1997 ) and the distribution of ysos in the ` a ' sub - cluster region indicates that ` a ' sub - cluster seems to be associated with the nw and ne clumps as referred by megeath & wilson ( 1997 ) , whereas ` c ' sub - cluster seems to be associated with the clump ` s ' .",
    "megeath & wilson ( 1997 ) found that the clump ` s ' ( -34 to -32 kms@xmath21 ) is kinematically and spatially distinct from the nw and ne clumps ( -32 to -29 kms@xmath21 ) .",
    "the velocity distribution suggests that clump ` s ' ( i.e. sub - cluster ` c ' ) is relatively near to the observer in comparison to the nw clump ` a ' .",
    "if we assume that the sub - clusters are not associated with each other , the spatial distribution of the ysos in the sub - cluster ` a ' reveals that the class ii sources are relativley near to the ionizing source in comparison to the class 0/i sources . we do not find this trend in the sub - cluster ` b ' .",
    "the distribution of ysos in sub - cluster ` c ' also show a similar trend however the statistics is poor .",
    "the distribution of the ysos detected by using the irac data in the case of a few brcs also shows that the class 0/i sources are found to be located more away from the ionizing sources as compared to class ii sources .",
    "this seems to indicate the propagation of star formation in the ngc 281 west region .",
    "as discussed in  4.3.2 that none of the class 0/i sources show x - ray emission . the high value of @xmath183 in the region could be a possible reason for non - detection of x - ray in the class 0/i sources .",

    "<S> we present a multiwavelength study of the ngc 281 complex which contains the young cluster ic 1590 at the center , using deep wide - field optical @xmath0 photometry , slitless spectroscopy along with archival data sets in the near - infrared ( nir ) and x - ray . </S>",
    "<S> the extent of ic 1590 is estimated to be @xmath16.5 pc . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster region shows a relatively small amount of differential reddening . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the identified young stellar objects ( ysos ) are low mass pms stars having age @xmath2 myr and mass 0.5 - 3.5 m@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope ( @xmath4 ) of the mass function for ic 1590 , in the mass range @xmath5 , is found to be @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the @xmath7-band luminosity function ( @xmath8 ) is similar to the average value ( @xmath10.4 ) reported for young clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of gas and dust obtained from the iras , co and radio maps indicates clumpy structures around the central cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the radial distribution of the young stellar objects , their ages , @xmath9(@xmath10 ) nir - excess , and the fraction of classical t tauri stars suggest triggered star formation at the periphery of the cluster region . </S>",
    "<S> however , deeper optical , nir and mir observations are needed to have a conclusive view of star formation scenario in the region . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the class 0/i and class ii sources detected by using the _ spitzer _ mid - infrared observations indicate that a majority of the class ii sources are x - ray emitting stars , whereas x - ray emission is absent from the class 0/i sources . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of class 0/i and class ii sources reveals the presence of three sub - clusters in the ngc 281 west region . </S>"
