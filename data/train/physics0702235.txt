    "liquid droplets are studied more and more intensively in the framework of microfluidic applications @xcite . among possible applications",
    ", droplets can be used in chemical engineering in order to mix tiny amounts of reactive substances . to achieve such a goal",
    ", one has to invent some processes to manipulate a droplet : motion , binary collision , fragmentation ... to prevent droplets from contamination , it is also important to avoid any contact with a solid element .",
    "this paper introduces a method that could eventually realize all those operations .",
    "the basic idea is to combine two physical phenomena : the delayed coalescence on a vibrated interface , and the partial coalescence .",
    "first , we describe both phenomena separately and identify the physical conditions required to achieve these effects .",
    "when a droplet is gently laid on a liquid bath at rest , it very quickly coalesces with the bath .",
    "because of the low air viscosity , the drainage of the air film between the droplet and the bath lasts less than a second ( a similar drainage process can be found in antibubbles @xcite ) .",
    "suddenly , the film becomes thin enough to break and there is a contact between the droplet and the bath .",
    "a droplet made of a low - viscosity liquid can experience a partial coalescence @xcite : it does not fully empty , and a new smaller droplet is formed above the bath interface ( as illustrated in the second image line of fig.[fig : montage ] ) .",
    "this daughter droplet can also coalesce partially .",
    "the process is repeated until the droplet becomes small enough to coalesce totally .",
    "when the droplet is made of a non - viscous liquid surrounded by air , the daughter droplet has a radius @xmath0 that is about half @xcite of the mother one ( @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 this phenomenon was first reported in 1930 by mahajan @xcite , and investigated by charles and mason in 1960 @xcite . in their experiments ,",
    "another immiscible liquid was surrounding the droplet ( instead of air ) .",
    "recently , many studies have focused on understanding this phenomenon @xcite . in general ,",
    "gravity and viscosity forces in both fluids tend to favor total coalescence @xcite .",
    "partial coalescence is only possible when surface tension is the dominant force .",
    "a measure of the relative influence of the droplet viscosity compared to surface tension is given by the ohnesorge number @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the viscosity of the liquid , @xmath5 its density , and @xmath6 the surface tension between the droplet and the air .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the critical ohnesorge corresponding to the transition from partial to total coalescence is approximately @xmath7 .",
    "small droplets ( @xmath8 ) undergo a total coalescence while larger ones ( @xmath9 ) coalesce only partially .",
    "two droplets are bouncing on a vibrated liquid / air interface .",
    "they meet and coalesce .",
    "the new droplet is too large to take off from the interface and to bounce , so it eventually coalesces partially after 110 ms .",
    "the daughter droplet is small enough to bounce again for several tens of seconds .",
    "the six pictures in this sequence are taken every 55 ms . ]",
    "typically , droplets can not stay more than a second on the liquid / air interface , due to gravity .",
    "in 2005 , couder _ et al . _ @xcite have found an original way to avoid coalescence . in their experiment ,",
    "the liquid bath is vertically vibrated by an eletromagnetic shaker .",
    "the sinusoidal vibration has a pulsation @xmath10 and an amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "when the reduced acceleration @xmath12 is sufficiently large , the droplet bounces periodically on the vibrated interface .",
    "the minimum acceleration @xmath13 for bouncing to occur has been estimated by couder _",
    "_ @xcite in the case of viscous droplets ) , couder _ et al .",
    "_ assume that the droplet is not able to store interfacial energy during the bouncing .",
    "the excess of kinetic energy at impact is then dissipated by viscous forces . ]",
    "as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a critical reynolds number ( constant ) , @xmath16 the air density , @xmath17 the liquid density , @xmath18 the gravity acceleration , @xmath19 the droplet radius ( when spherical ) and @xmath20 the horizontal extension of the film between the droplet and the bath . although @xmath20 has no simple analytical form , it has been shown @xcite that @xmath13 is monotonically increasing with @xmath19 .",
    "this means that for a given reduced acceleration @xmath21 , there is a critical size @xmath22 such as @xmath23 one can reasonably think that this conclusion is still valid when droplets are not viscous .",
    "this point will be shown below . in reality",
    ", droplets experience a finite lifetime before coalescence , even when they bounce : the film between the droplet and the bath breaks and the droplet coalesces @xcite , sometimes after a thousand bounces .",
    "moreover , when the vibration amplitude is too high , steady waves appear on the bath interface , due to the faraday instability @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "the trajectory of the droplet generally becomes chaotic and the lifetime is considerably reduced .",
    "the more viscous the bath is , the higher is the faraday acceleration threshold @xmath24 .",
    "et al . _ have noted that when the bath is vibrated just below @xmath24 , the droplets are sometimes able to move horizontally on the interface @xcite . in this regime , droplets can strongly interact among themselves or with obstacles @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the key idea is to combine both effects : ( i ) the partial coalescence , that allows to change the radius of the droplet according to eq.([eq : partcoal ] ) and ( ii ) the delayed coalescence that becomes efficient when @xmath25 .",
    "conditions on surface tension and viscosity have to be satisfied in order to observe both phenomena . according to the ohnesorge criterion ,",
    "should be slightly different . ]",
    "the kinematic viscosity of the droplet liquid has to be lower than 3.7cst in order to ensure the partial coalescence of a millimetric droplet ( with @xmath26kg / m@xmath27 and @xmath28n / m ) .",
    "for such a low viscosity , @xmath29 while @xmath30 according to eq.([eq : couder ] ) .",
    "therefore , it does not seem possible to stop a cascade of partial coalescences when using the same viscosity for the droplet and for the bath .",
    "however , one can satisfy eq.([eq : ohnesorge ] ) and eq.([eq : bouncingcondition ] ) by considering a droplet made of silicon oil with a low viscosity ( 0.65cst ) bouncing on a bath with a large viscosity ( 1000cst ) .",
    "we apply vertical vibrations to a 7 mm - thick bath of 1000cst silicon oil in order to recover the daughter droplets of the partial coalescence .",
    "the frequency of the bath vibration is varied from 40 to 100hz .",
    "the acceleration is tuned from 0 to 2.5 g and measured with an accelerometer ; the precision is estimated below 0.4m",
    "/ s@xmath31 , @xmath18 being the gravity .    during a partial coalescence , the coalescing part of the droplet forms a pool at the bath surface .",
    "the liquid of this pool can not immediately mix with the surrounding highly viscous oil .",
    "consequently , the daughter droplet of the partial coalescence has unavoidably to make its firsts bounces on the pool formed by its own mother droplet .",
    "this does not perturbe the bouncing too much . sometimes , due to inertial effects",
    ", the daughter droplet does not succeed in quickly stabilizing its bouncing on the vibrating interface ( it was observed even when @xmath32 ) . in this case , another partial coalescence is necessary .    a fast video recorder ( redlake motion pro ) is placed near the surface .",
    "movies of coalescences have been recorded at a rate of up to 1000 frames per second .",
    "the droplet diameter is measured from the images with an absolute error due to the finite pixel size ( about 30@xmath33 m ) .",
    "since the droplet is constantly deforming , this measurement is made on the few images where the droplet appears the most spherical .",
    "figure [ fig : montage ] illustrates a typical scenario observed with droplets on a vibrated interface .",
    "two small droplets are laid next to each other on the bath .",
    "they are small enough to take off and bounce .",
    "they approach each other and coalesce into a large droplet .",
    "this resulting droplet is now too large to take off , as the thin air film that separates it from the bath can not be regenerated during the vibration .",
    "the droplet experiences a few oscillations before coalescing : it is unstable .",
    "the coalescence is partial and the daughter droplet is small enough to bounce again .",
    "the system behaves as a low pass filter : partial coalescences occur , decreasing the radius of the droplet , until the radius of the droplet respects the condition expressed in eq.([eq : bouncingcondition ] ) .",
    "this experiment is repeated several times , with various droplet sizes .",

    "critical radius @xmath34 as a function of the bath reduced acceleration @xmath35 for various frequencies : 50hz(@xmath36 ) - 60hz(@xmath37 ) - 75hz(@xmath38 ) - 100hz(@xmath39 ) .",
    "black symbols correspond to the largest observed stable droplets while open symbols correspond to the smallest observed unstable droplets . the critical radius @xmath40 is located between these two bounds . the dashed vertical line is the minimum acceleration for bouncing .",

    "may be defined as the maximum value of the radius for a stable bouncing droplet .",
    "the minimum acceleration @xmath43 needed to stabilize droplets is lower than 1 .",
    "it seems impossible to find a bouncing droplet on the left of the vertical dashed line .",
    "the on - off behavior of the stabilization process around @xmath44 has to be nuanced .",
    "indeed , the lifetime of a bouncing droplet should be considered close to the boundaries .",
    "some combinations of the parameters probably stabilize droplets for a longer time than others , or allow to stop the cascade of partial coalescences at an intermediate value between @xmath45 and @xmath46 mm .",
    "in our experiments , low viscous droplets are bouncing on a high viscous bath .",
    "it means that the deformation of the droplet is larger than the deformation of the bath : the droplet is more able to store and restore interfacial energy in order to ensure the bouncing .",
    "conditions are comparable to an elastic ball bouncing on a rigid plate .    first",
    ", according to eq.([eq : couder ] ) , @xmath47 for viscous droplets .",
    "however , since non - viscous droplets can restore surface energy ( the dissipation being limited ) , the bouncing is possible for reduced accelerations lower than 1 : a restitution coefficient has to be taken into account .",
    "the analogy between the non - viscous droplet and the elastic ball ( defined and analyzed in @xcite ) allows us to define this restitution coefficient @xmath48 of the droplet , such as : @xmath49 this value is higher than the restitution coefficient of 0.22 found in previous works @xcite .",
    "however , some aspects have to be taken into account : ( 1 ) in those experiments , small ( less deformable ) droplets bounce on a low - viscous ( deformable ) bath . the restitution mechanism is consequently not the same as in our case . ( 2 ) moreover , for elastic beads , it is known that the restitution coefficient tends to 1 when the impact velocity tends to 0 @xcite . in our case ,",
    "impact velocities near the critical acceleration are about @xmath50cm / s while in @xcite , impact velocities are at least ten times higher .",
    "this could also explain the difference between restitution coefficients in both configurations .",
    "second , experimental points of fig.[fig : phasediag ] define two regions in the @xmath51 diagram .",
    "the boundaries that depend on the frequency are shown as continuous curves based on a qualitative fit . for a given frequency ,",
    "droplets located above the curve are unstable while droplets located below are stable .",
    "more precisely , when a droplet is created with a radius larger than the critical droplet radius @xmath52 , the droplet partially coalesces until it reaches the stable region ( below the curves ) .",
    "the stability threshold @xmath40 slightly increases with the forcing acceleration , as in eq.([eq : couder ] ) .",
    "the curves seem to saturate at high accelerations towards an asymptotical value @xmath41 that decreases with an increasing frequency .",
    "since the bath is much more viscous than the droplet , the droplet deformation is the main elastic mechanism able to ensure the bouncing . a characteristic size related to the deformation",
    "is given by the wavelength of the first normal mode . according to @xcite , for a sitting droplet ,",
    "this wavelength @xmath53 satisfies to : @xmath54 the radius @xmath42 corresponding to @xmath53 is represented in fig.[fig : phasediag ] .",
    "it fits well to the asymptotical value @xmath55 for high accelerations .",
    "this fact suggests that the first mode of droplets deformation is related to the maximum bouncing droplet size for a given frequency .",
    "finally , the critical radius @xmath34 has been measured as a function of the frequency , the acceleration being fixed @xmath56 ( fig.[fig : phasediag2 ] ) .",
    "open circles correspond to the smallest unstable droplets , while black circles are related to the largest stable ones .",
    "the continuous line represents eq.([eq : courty ] ) .",
    "the curve does not fit the experimental results because the asymptotic regime is not reached when @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , sitting and bouncing droplet geometries are not exactly equivalent .",
    "however , we found that the decreasing of @xmath34 with increasing frequencies ( at @xmath56 ) is coherent with the decreasing of @xmath42 .",
    "critical radius @xmath34 as a function of the frequency when @xmath57 .",
    "black circles correspond to the largest observed stable droplets while open circles correspond to the smallest observed unstable droplets . the critical radius @xmath34 is located between these two bounds .",
    "the continuous line corresponds to eq.([eq : courty ] ) . ]",
    "in summary , we have developed a method to stop a cascade of partial coalescences and to maintain the residual droplet alive on the interface .",
    "our approach is based on the experiment of couder @xcite , that consists in the bouncing of a droplet on a bath subjected to a vertical vibration .",
    "we have shown that it is essential to use a viscous liquid for the bath and a low - viscous one for the droplet . the threshold radius below which the droplet can bounce",
    "has been found to depend on the acceleration and on the frequency of the bath . by tuning these forcing parameters",
    ", it is possible to choose the maximum allowed size for bouncing droplets in a broad range .",
    "a concordance is observed between the radius of the largest stable droplet ( for a given frequency ) and the radius related to the first normal mode of deformation ."
