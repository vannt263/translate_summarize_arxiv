    "<S> many models have been proposed@xcite . for phenomenological implications </S>",
    "<S> it is of more importance to clarify how susy breaking is communicated to the visible sector . </S>",
    "<S> two ways of transmitting susy breaking to the visible sector have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that gravitational interactions in @xmath2 supergravity theory play this role@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second is that gauge interactions play the role of the messenger@xcite . in the framework of superstring theory </S>",
    "<S> it seems that the gravity - mediated susy breaking scenario is plausible . in the context of the weakly coupled heterotic @xmath3 superstring , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is considered to be the hidden sector gauge symmetry . if supersymmetric gauge dynamics in the hidden sector , such as gaugino condensation , cause susy breaking to occur , the effects of the susy breaking will be transmitted to the observable sector through gravitational interactions . in these types of simple models@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath5-components of moduli fields other than the dilaton are expected to develop their vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gauginos acquire their soft susy breaking masses at one loop , but not at the tree level . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the gaugino masses turn out to be too small compared to the soft scalar masses . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we have the relations @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the gaugino mass , the soft scalar mass and the gravitino mass , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this mass spectrum of superparticles is phenomenologically unacceptable . </S>",
    "<S> although it has been pointed out that this problem can be solved in strongly coupled heterotic @xmath3 superstring theory ( m - theory)@xcite@xcite , there remains another problem regarding non - universality of the soft breaking mass parameters . since in string theory the moduli fields are generally charged under the flavor symmetry , the soft scalar masses become flavor - dependent . as a result of these non - universal properties for the scalar masses , </S>",
    "<S> we are confronted with the so - called fcnc problem . with regard to this point </S>",
    "<S> , the gauge - mediated susy breaking scenario has the advantage of producing the universal soft scalar masses and then ensuring sufficient suppression of the fcnc .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new model based on the weakly coupled heterotic string on the calabi - yau compactification , whose superparticle mass spectrum is phenomenologically viable and which is free from the fcnc problem . </S>",
    "<S> the breakdown of susy coming from the hidden sector gaugino condensation begins by being transmitted to anti - generation fields in the observable sector via gravitational interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the assumption that only vevs of the khler class moduli fields @xmath10 acquire nonvanishing @xmath5-components . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent transmission of susy breaking to the low - energy mssm sector occurs via gauge interactions . </S>",
    "<S> then the gaugino masses are of the same order as the soft scalar masses . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , due to the flavor - blind nature of gauge interactions , we obtain the universal soft scalar masses .    </S>",
    "<S> the four - dimensional effective theory in the observable sector from the weakly coupled calabi - yau string is characterized by @xmath2 susy , the @xmath11 gauge group , and massless matter fields which belong to @xmath12 and @xmath13 representations in @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the massless chiral superfields apart from @xmath11 singlets consist of @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the family number at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 sets of vector - like multiplets are included in the massless sector . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers @xmath17 and @xmath16 represent the generation number and the anti - generation number , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers coincide with the hodge numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the compactified manifold , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the sake of simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the particles beyond the mssm are contained in @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in @xmath22 we have color - triplet higgses @xmath23 and @xmath24 and a singlet @xmath25 as well as the quark superfield @xmath26 lepton superfield @xmath27 and </S>",
    "<S> higgs doublets @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there appear a dilaton field @xmath29 , @xmath19 khler class moduli fields @xmath30 , and @xmath18 complex structure moduli fields @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the vev of a dilaton field @xmath29 determines the gauge coupling constant , and the vevs of the moduli fields @xmath31 and @xmath30 parametrize the size and shapes of the compactified manifold . in the observable sector from the calabi - yau string , </S>",
    "<S> the superpotential @xmath32 contains trilinear terms in @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the appropriate holomorphic functions of the moduli fields @xmath38 and @xmath10 , respectively . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn3 ] ) we have omitted the generation indices . in ref.@xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the cubic terms of @xmath34 in the superpotential are corrected by instantons on the string worldsheet . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that in the calabi - yau string , @xmath40 and @xmath34 couple separately to the @xmath38 moduli and the @xmath10 moduli , respectively @xcite . as mentioned above , in the observable sector </S>",
    "<S> , the seed of susy breaking is expected to be a nonvanishing vev of @xmath41 @xcite , which is the @xmath5-component of the moduli field @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5-components of the dilaton @xmath29 and the moduli @xmath38 are assumed to have vanishing vevs . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is the same as that in the moduli - dominated susy breaking scenario@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter we denote the vev of the moduli field @xmath10 by the same letter as the field . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we write @xmath42 .    in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn3 ] ) the trilinear coupling of @xmath34 contains the terms @xmath43 if the singlet field @xmath44 acquires a nonvanishing vev @xmath45 @xcite , then @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 in @xmath34 gain supersymmetric masses @xmath50 also , we have the soft susy breaking scalar masses , which are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath10 . therefore , the scalar particles in @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 have the masses squared @xmath53 .    since only the anti - generation fields @xmath34 couple to the @xmath10 moduli , the fields @xmath34 behave as messenger fields in the framework of the gauge - mediated susy breaking scenario . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the flavor dependence of @xmath54 is not transmitted to the generation fields @xmath40 . in the gut - type models which accommodate the mssm at low energies , @xmath45 and @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> are expected to be larger than @xmath56 gev @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> these messenger fields will become sufficiently heavy compared to the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the other extra fields belonging to one set of the vector - like multiplet also become massive near or slightly above the intermediate energy scale via nonrenormalizable interactions @xcite . on the other hand , due to vanishing @xmath5-terms of the @xmath38 moduli , the generation fields @xmath40 can not behave as messenger fields . </S>",
    "<S> the messenger fields @xmath34 have the quantum number of the standard model gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , integrating out the messenger sector gives rise to gaugino masses at one loop . </S>",
    "<S> estimating one - loop diagrams , one finds that the gaugino masses induced are @xmath57 where @xmath58 and the @xmath59s are the gauge coupling constants ( @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the soft scalar masses in the low - energy mssm sector , in which @xmath61 sets of the generation fields @xmath62 remain light , arise at leading order from two - loop diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> messenger fields , gauge bosons and gauginos take part in the internal lines of the two - loop diagrams . consequently , </S>",
    "<S> the soft scalar masses induced are of the same order as the gaugino masses : @xmath63 provided that @xmath64 is @xmath65 , the mass spectrum of superparticles is consistent with that in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the significant features of this scenario are that there are sufficient degeneracies among squarks ( sleptons ) to ensure adequate suppression of fcnc and that no new @xmath66 phases are induced in soft susy breaking parameters .    as a consequence of the worldsheet instanton effects , @xmath37 is of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath69 is related to the compactification radius @xmath70 as @xmath71 in units of the string scale . </S>",
    "<S> the string scale @xmath72 is defined by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the string tension . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn10 ] ) , @xmath64 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn8 ] ) becomes @xmath75 . in view of the fact that @xmath76 corresponds to an axion - like field , it is adequate for us to require the periodicity of @xmath37 in units of the string scale . </S>",
    "<S> in this context we postulate that @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have @xmath78 with the scale @xmath79 , we find that the gaugino masses are on the order of a few hundred gev .    </S>",
    "<S> now we proceed to discuss the gravitino mass . in the </S>",
    "<S> weakly coupled heterotic string , the khler potential is given by @xcite @xmath80 here the dots represent the higher - order terms . using the above khler potential and assuming a vanishing cosmological constant , we obtain the gravitino mass @xmath81 in string theory , the compactification radius is expected to be around the inverse string scale . from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn9 ] ) , ( [ eqn11 ] ) and ( [ eqn13 ] ) we obtain the phenomenologically viable relations @xmath82 since the gaugino mass and the scalar mass are also induced by gravitational interactions , we must study whether or not the gauge - mediated contribution is dominated by a gravity - mediated contribution . in the </S>",
    "<S> weakly coupled heterotic string , the gauge - kinetic function in the observable sector is of the form @xmath83 , and we have @xmath84 in the weak coupling region . </S>",
    "<S> the second term in @xmath85 comes from the string one - loop correction and @xmath86 is a small constant fixed by gauge and gravitational anomaly@xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gravity - mediated contribution to the gaugino mass is given by @xmath87 since we have @xmath88 at the unification scale , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn15 ] ) cac be rewritten as @xmath89 from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn11 ] ) and ( [ eqn16 ] ) the ratio of @xmath90 to @xmath91 becomes @xmath92 further , the gravity - mediated contribution to the scalar mass is given by @xmath93 up to a one - loop correction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the ratio of @xmath94 to @xmath8 becomes @xmath95 where we have taken @xmath96 at the unification scale . as can be deduced from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath97 ) and ( @xmath98 ) , the gauge - mediated contribution to the gaugino mass and scalar mass are dominant compared to the gravity - mediated contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the @xmath99 problem . in the present model the @xmath99 term comes from the first term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn3 ] ) with @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath101 term is generated in the two - loop diagram as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the messenger fields ( @xmath34 ) propagate in the innermost loop . </S>",
    "<S> the external lines are the scalar fields @xmath102 and @xmath103 and the remaining internal line has the fermion mass insertion @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of @xmath105 to @xmath106 becomes @xmath107 provided that @xmath108 . introducing a certain type of flavor symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain @xmath109 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the @xmath99 problem is solved .    in conclusion </S>",
