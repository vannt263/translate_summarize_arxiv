    "<S> @xcite on the loop - level effects of effective operators on precision electroweak observables . </S>",
    "<S> those papers focused on the divergent portions of the loop diagrams and a subset of the finite parts , and did not appreciate that unambiguous bounds could be obtained on the coefficients of the effective operators . </S>",
    "<S> we use the full ( finite plus divergent ) expressions in order to obtain unambiguous bounds on a particular pair of effective operator coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations involve only weak boson self energies , also called oblique corrections . </S>",
    "<S> methods for organizing and applying such corrections to observables are well known @xcite and will be used throughout the analysis .    because we are dealing with loops of gauge or higgs bosons , which are not significantly heavier than the @xmath3 mass , the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , parametrization of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite may not be accurate . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to an analysis of top - quark loops in which the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , parameters are useful due to the large mass of the top quark @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> when used to extend the standard model , a general effective field theory can be written in the form @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are dimensionless coefficients , @xmath9 is the energy scale of new physics , and the @xmath10 are effective operators with mass dimension six . </S>",
    "<S> we have not included a dimension - five term in the above expression because there is only one such operator , and it does not involve weak bosons @xcite .    in the basis of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there are nine dimension - six operators involving only weak bosons and/or higgs doublets that affect precision electroweak measurements at tree or one - loop level . </S>",
    "<S> four of these operators affect weak boson self energies at tree level . of the remaining five , three affect triple gauge couplings and </S>",

    "<S> this paper will focus on the remaining two operators , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 are the pauli matrices ) , and @xmath15 is the standard model higgs doublet .    </S>",
    "<S> the above two operators affect precision electroweak observables only through oblique corrections . </S>",
    "<S> when the higgs field takes its vacuum expectation value , both operators appear to affect the weak boson self energies at tree level ; however , because the operators have the same form as the standard model gauge kinetic terms , all corrections generated by these operators that involve only gauge bosons can be absorbed into the standard model through field and coupling redefinitions . </S>",

    "<S> data taken from @xcite.[tab : observables ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now apply equations ( [ dx1 ] ) and ( [ dx2 ] ) to the electroweak observables listed in table [ tab : observables ] . in order to obtain a bound on the coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we use the @xmath40 statistic @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the error matrix , related to the errors for each observable , @xmath44 , and the error correlation matrix , @xmath45,@xcite @xmath46    we calculate the bounds by first setting @xmath47 to the value ( as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) which minimizes @xmath40 , @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we make no assumptions about @xmath47 , but rather allow its value to float . </S>",
    "<S> we then write this new @xmath40 in the following way @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the value of @xmath40 minimized with respect to all coefficients , @xmath53 is the best fit value of the coefficient @xmath8 , and @xmath54 is a symmetric matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at bounds by solving the equation @xmath55    we can diagonalize @xmath54 to find two statistically independent combinations of our two operators and obtain a bound on those . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath56 the contributions of the two coefficients are essentially decoupled due to the fact that the net effect of @xmath16 is significantly larger than that of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> while both coefficients are consistent with zero , the central value of @xmath16 differs from zero by just over one standard deviation .    if we instead compute bounds for each coefficient separately , setting the other coefficient to zero in each case , we obtain @xmath57 we again see that the net effect of @xmath16 is significantly larger than that of @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> .    we can attempt to gain some understanding of the very different numerical impact of these two operators by considering the oblique parameters @xmath58 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters are defined in terms of a taylor expansion of the self energies about @xmath59 , and are therefore useful if the values of @xmath60 probed by the experiments are within the radius of convergence of the expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the nearest singularities of the self energies are branch points at @xmath61 and @xmath62 from the first two diagrams in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> since all precision electroweak data are at values of @xmath60 less than these values , the taylor expansion should converge . in a sense , the higgs boson is playing the role of the `` heavy '' particle in the formalism , analogous to the role of the top quark in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> analytic expressions for the oblique parameters @xmath58 are given in appendix  [ apdx : oblique ] . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the coefficient @xmath39 contributes only to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath63 contains a contribution at tree level from @xmath66 , it can not be used to constrain @xmath39 ; we conclude that @xmath64 and @xmath65 must be the oblique parameters that determine the bound on @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are not parametrically suppressed with respect to the other oblique parameters , so there is no obvious reason why the bound on @xmath39 is so much weaker than the bound on @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> this marks the first time bounds on these operators have been obtained from precision electroweak data using the full power of the effective field theory framework . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds obtained are unambiguous and independent of any assumptions about the coefficient of the operator @xmath20 , which was allowed to float . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous result for top - quark loops is given in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us compare this calculation with the previous calculations of refs .  @xcite . as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , these papers did not appreciate that unambiguous bounds could be obtained on the operators from a one - loop analysis of precision electroweak data . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , only the divergent portion of the one - loop diagrams , and a subset of the finite parts ( those that are proportional to @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) , were calculated . </S>",
    "<S> a bound on the coefficients of @xmath16 and @xmath17 was obtained by assuming that the coefficient of the operator @xmath20 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this is an unjustified assumption , because the coefficient of the operator @xmath20 is renormalized by @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , in the @xmath69 scheme , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the renormalized coefficient and @xmath72 is the bare coefficient . there is no reason why the renormalized coefficient should vanish . </S>",
    "<S> making this unjustified assumption allows one to extract much stronger bounds on @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but these stronger bounds are specious . in contrast , </S>",
    "<S> our bounds are obtained by letting @xmath71 float . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting bounds on @xmath48 and @xmath49 are unambiguous and do not depend on the renormalization scale @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> the bounds we obtained on the coefficients of the operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 at one loop from precision electroweak data are so weak that they are easily eclipsed by bounds obtained by tree - level processes involving the higgs boson @xcite . </S>",
