    "understanding the changes of the matrix elements of the gluon operators near the critical temperature in qcd offers a useful picture on the nature of the qcd phase transition@xcite .",
    "these can also be used in qcd sum rule analysis to understand the changes and melting of heavy quark system at finite temperature@xcite .    in the pure gauge theory ,",
    "the lowest dimensional operators are the scalar gluon condensate and the twist 2 gluon operator .",
    "these dimension 4 operators can be reexpressed in terms of the electric condensate and the magnetic condensate .",
    "the temperature dependence of these operators can be calculated directly from lattice calculation of the space time and space space elementary plaquette@xcite or from combining the calculation of the energy density and pressure@xcite .",
    "the calculations show that while there is rapid change of the electric condensate across the phase transition temperature , the magnetic condensate changes very little@xcite .    using the temperature dependence of the dimension 4 condensates as the input in the qcd sum rule approach for the heavy quark system , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "was found to undergo a rapid property change across the phase transition@xcite and to their dissociation@xcite slightly above the critical temperature .",
    "moreover , it was also found that the free energy extracted from lattice calculation is the relevant potential to describe @xmath0 in a potential model@xcite .",
    "the extension to finite density also has interesting application@xcite .    to further understand the phase transition in terms of local operators and to expand the findings for the charmonium system by using qcd sum rule to dimension 6 level",
    ", we will identify the dimension 6 and twist 4 gluon operators and calculate their renormalization in the pure gauge theory .",
    "the renormalization of scalar dimension 4 operators and scalar dimension 6 operators are well known@xcite .",
    "our result completes the calculation of renormalization of all the dimension 6 gluon operator , hence will be a first step toward identifying their mixing and thus a systematic analysis in the operator product expansion ( ope ) of heavy quark correlation functions up to dimension 6@xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we will identify the independent operators at dimension 6 . in section iii , we will renormalize these independent operators up to one loop order .",
    "the scale invariant vacuum condensate will then be given in section iv .",
    "section v is a summary .",
    "the gauge invariant dimension 6 operators are obtained by combining the covariant derivative @xmath2 and the field strength tensor @xmath3 . to find the independent even parity operators , we use the bianchi identity and symmetry property of the indices . here",
    ", we start from the operators that are of the type @xmath4 ; that is , multiplication of two covariant component each composed of a covariant derivative acting on the field strength tensor .    for the scalar operator , the indices ` @xmath5 ' have to become ` @xmath6 ' type . considering the indices ,",
    "the covariant component @xmath7 can be a term in one of the two types of the bianchi identities . in the first case , the three indices",
    "` @xmath8 ' are independent while in the second case , two indices are identical and summed over ` @xmath9 ' .",
    "@xmath10 the scalar dimension 6 operator can be obtained from one of the terms in the product of the same type in eq .",
    "( [ bianchi1 ] ) .",
    "initially , four operators can be constructed from @xmath11 , and one operator from @xmath12 . however , among the four types of operators coming from @xmath11 , using the symmetry property of the indices , one can show that only one operator is independent , irrespective of the order of their indices .",
    "therefore , there exists two independent scalar operators .",
    "that is ,    d_g^a_d_g^a _ , d_g^a_d_g^a_.    using the equation of motion , the second operator can be written in terms of quark operator , which vanishes in the pure gauge theory .",
    "using higher dimensional bianchi identity of the form @xmath13=0 $ ] , one can show that the usually quoted scalar operator can be obtained by combining the two independent operators .",
    "@xmath14    similarly , for the spin 2 operators , the indices ` @xmath5 ' become ` @xmath15 ' ; that is , @xmath16 indices remain free while @xmath17 indices are summed over",
    ". then , there are four types of bianchi identities that become relevant .    & type1 : d_ag_bc+d_bg_ca+d_cg_ab=0 + & type2 : d_ag_cd+d_cg_da+d_dg_ac=0 + & type3 : d_cg_dd+d_dg_dc+d_dg_cd=0 + & type4 : d_ag_cc+d_cg_ca+d_cg_ac=0",
    ".    the full operator can be obtained from one of the terms in the multiplication of @xmath18 to @xmath19 and @xmath20 to themselves . in this case",
    ", one operator is obtained from @xmath21 , two operators from @xmath12 , and one from @xmath22 . however , using the higher dimensional bianchi identity , one can obtain a relation among the four operators .",
    "hence , there are only three independent dimension 6 spin2 gluon operators . in this work",
    ", we will use the following set@xcite :    & scalar : f^abcg^a_g^b_g^c _ , d_g^a_d_g^a _ + & spin2 : d_g^a_d_g^a_,d_g^a_d_g^a_,d_g^a_d _",
    "g^a_.    on the other hand , using the equation of motion , we find that only two gluon operators of dimension 6 remain in the pure gauge theory .",
    "these are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the latter operator is proportional to @xmath25 with two spin indices @xmath26 .",
    "introducing the color e and b fields , we find the off diagonal components are of the forms @xmath27 or @xmath28 , the matrix elements of which vanish in the medium at rest due to rotational invariance . therefore , the two independent dimension 6 operators in the pure gauge theory that remain and that constitute the diagonal components and the scalar operators are @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the renormalization of scalar operators are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we will focus on the spin2 traceless(twist4 ) part .",
    "we will use the three independent set as mentioned in the previous section after making the operators symmetric and traceless with respect to the two spin indices .",
    "we will therefore discuss the renormalization of the following three operators :    & o_1=d_g^a_d_g^a_|_st , + & o_2=d_g^a_d _ g^a_|_st , + & o_3=d_g^a_d _ g^a_|_st ,    where we have suppressed the external indices @xmath31 in the left hand side and @xmath32 means that @xmath33 .",
    "first , we will study the renormalization of @xmath34 up to one loop order using the background field method with zero momentum insertion@xcite .    to study the renormalization of the operator , we consider the following green s functions with external fields ,    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 is the background gluon field and @xmath37 the backgroundfield renormalization constant .",
