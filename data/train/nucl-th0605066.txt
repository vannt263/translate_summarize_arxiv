    "the interpretation of the low - lying @xmath1 strength in neutron - rich nuclei engendered a debate : are these soft dipole modes  just a manifestation of the loosely - bound character of light neutron - rich nuclei , or are they a manifestation of the excitation of a resonance ?",
    "as far as i know , there has not been a definite answer to this simple question .",
    "this apparently innocuous question has nonetheless become the center of a even more widespread debate .",
    "it is believed that the weak binding of outermost neutrons gives rise to a direct break up of the nucleus and a consequent concentration of the electromagnetic response at low energies .",

    "this is akin to a method developed long time ago by fermi @xcite and usually known as the weizsaecker - williams method @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath35 can be interpreted as the number of equivalent ( real ) photons incident on the nucleus per unit scattering angle @xmath36 and per unit photon energy @xmath37 note that @xmath38 ( monopole ) transitions do not appear in this formalism . as immediately inferred from eq .",
    "[ photo ] , for @xmath39 the response function @xmath40 vanishes because the volume integral of the transition density also vanishes in the long - wavelength approximation .",
    "but for larger scattering angles the coulomb multipole matrix elements ( @xmath41 ) in eq .",
    "[ pwba ] are in general larger than the electric ( @xmath22 ) multipoles , and monopole transitions become relevant @xcite .    in figure [ dnde1 ]",
    "we show the virtual photon spectrum for the @xmath1 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 multipolarities for electron scattering off arbitrary nuclei at @xmath44 mev .",
    "these spectra have been obtained assuming a maximum scattering angle of 5 degrees .",
    "an evident feature deduced from this figure is that the spectrum increases rapidly with decreasing energies .",
    "also , at excitation energies of 1 mev , the spectrum yields the ratios @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "however , although @xmath47 increases with the multipolarity @xmath48 , the nuclear response decreases rapidly with @xmath48 , and @xmath1 excitations tend to dominate the reaction . for larger electron energies the ratios @xmath49 and @xmath50 decrease rapidly .",
    "note that a similar relationship as eq .",
    "[ epa ] also exists for coulomb excitation @xcite in heavy ion scattering . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show a comparison between the @xmath1 virtual photon spectrum , @xmath51 , of 1 gev electrons with the spectrum generated by 1 gev / nucleon heavy ion projectiles . in the case of coulomb excitation ,",
    "the virtual photon spectrum was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "2.5.5a . for simplicity , we use for the strong interaction distance @xmath52 fm .",
    "the spectrum for the heavy ion case is much larger than that of the electron for large projectile charges . for @xmath53pb projectiles it can be of the order of 1000 times larger than that of an electron of the same energy . as a natural consequence , reaction rates for coulomb excitation are larger than for electron excitation . but electrons have the advantage of being a clean electromagnetic probe , while coulomb excitation at high energies needs a detailed theoretical analysis of the data due to contamination by nuclear excitation .",
    "as one observes in figure [ fig2 ] , the virtual spectrum for the electron contains more hard photons , i.e. the spectrum decreases slower with photon energy than the heavy ion photon spectrum .",
    "this is because , in both situations , the rate at which the spectrum decreases depends on the ratio of the projectile kinetic energy to its rest mass , @xmath54 which is much larger for the electron ( @xmath55 ) than for the heavy ion ( @xmath56 nuclear mass ) .    to obtain an effective luminosity per unit energy , the equivalent photon number is multiplied by the experimental luminosity , @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 . the number of events per unit time , @xmath59 , is given by the integral @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the photonuclear cross section . assuming that the photonuclear cross section peaks at energy @xmath62 and using the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule @xcite , we can approximate this integral by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is expressed in units of @xmath65s@xmath66mev@xmath66 .",
    "the giant resonances exhaust most part of the trk sum rule and occur in nuclei at energies around @xmath67 mev . for 1 gev electrons @xmath68/mev . with a luminosity of @xmath69 @xmath65s@xmath66 ,",
    "one gets @xmath70 @xmath65mev@xmath66s@xmath66 and a number of events @xmath71 s@xmath66 .",
    "thus , for medium mass nuclei , one expects thousands of events per day .",
    "these estimates increase linearly with the accelerator luminosity , @xmath57 , and show that studies of giant resonances in neutron - rich nuclei is very promising at the proposed facilities @xcite . only a small fraction , of the order of 5%-10% , of the trk sum - rule goes into the excitation of soft - dipole modes @xcite . however , these modes occur at a much lower energy , @xmath72 mev , where the number of equivalent photons ( see figure 2 ) is at least one order of magnitude larger than for giant resonance energies",
    ". therefore , inelastic processes leading to the excitation of soft dipole modes will be as abundant as those for excitation of giant resonances .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that it is not clear if experiments with very short - lived nuclei will be feasible at the proposed electron - ion colliders .",
    "in this section i will consider the dissociation of a weakly - bound ( halo ) nucleus from a bound state into a structureless continuum .",

    "the strong dependence of the response function on the effective range expansion parameters makes it an ideal tool to study the scattering properties of light nuclei which are of interest for nuclear astrophysics .",
    "it is important to notice that the one - halo has been studied in many experiments , e.g. for the case of @xmath124be for which there are many data available ( see refs .",

    "[ photo ] .",
    "one would have to use final wavefunctions with given momenta , including their angular information . when the final state interaction is disregarded these wavefunctions are three - body plane waves @xcite . to carry out the calculations ,",
    "the plane waves can be expanded in products of hyperspherical harmonics in coordinate and momentum spaces . however , since we are only interested in the energy dependence of the response function , we do not need directions of the momenta .",

    "the width of the response function obviously depends on the separation energy .",
    "but it also depends on the nature of the model , i.e. if it is a two - body model , like the model often adopted for @xmath124be or @xmath241b , or a three - body model , appropriate for @xmath124li and @xmath125he . in the two - body model",

    "this value is also not in discordance with experiments ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "better microscopic models , e.g. those based on random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations @xcite are necessary to study pigmy resonances .",
    "the halo nucleons have to be treated in an special way to get the response at the right energy position , and with approximately the right width @xcite .",
    "electron scattering will provide a unique opportunity to clarify this issue due to its better resolution over coulomb excitation .",
    "one might argue that the total breakup cross section would be a good signature for discerning direct dissociation versus the dissociation through the excitation of a pigmy collective vibration .",

    "i have studied the feasibility to determine low energy excitation properties of light , exotic , nuclei from experimental data on inelastic electron scattering .",
    "it was shown that for the conditions attained in the electron - ion collider mode , the electron scattering cross sections are directly proportional to photonuclear processes with real photons .",
    "this proportionality is lost when larger scattering angles , and larger ratio of the excitation energy to the electron energy , @xmath271 , are involved .",
    "one of the important issues to be studied in future electron - ion colliders is the nuclear response at low energies .",
    "this response can be modeled in two ways : by a ( a ) direct breakup and by a ( a ) collective excitation .",
    "we have shown that in the case of direct breakup the response function will depend quite strongly on the final state interaction .",
    "this may become a very useful technique to obtain phase - shifts , or effective - range expansion parameters , of fragments far from the stability line . in the case of collective excitations ,",
    "a variant of the goldhaber - teller and steinwedel - jensen model was used to obtain the transition densities in halo nuclei .",
    "the pygmy resonance lies above the neutron emission threshold , effectively precluding its observation in ( @xmath272,@xmath273 ) experiments on very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "nonetheless , electron scattering experiments will probe the response function under several conditions , including different bombarding energies , different scattering angles , etc .",
