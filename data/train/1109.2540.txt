    "data from nuclear collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have been interpreted within a hydrodynamic ( hydro ) context to demonstrate the formation of a thermalized , flowing partonic medium with small viscosity  @xcite .",
    "however , alternative analysis of spectrum and correlation data reveals a minimum - bias jet or _ minijet _",
    "contribution whose variation with centrality and collision energy seems to conflict with hydro expectations  @xcite .",
    "a large - amplitude 2d peak at the origin in angular correlations on pseudorapidity @xmath0 and azimuth @xmath1 expected as a jet manifestation persists even in central collisions , albeit the 2d peak is elongated on @xmath0 relative to a nominally symmetric jet cone  @xcite .    the competition between minimum - bias jets and flows to explain the final - state structure of rhic collisions has recently intensified and now focuses on the ss 2d peak in @xmath2-integral angular correlations .",
    "the minijet interpretation of the ss peak in more - central collisions  @xcite has been challenged .",
    "the peak has been reinterpreted in terms of `` triangular flow '' resulting from conjectured initial - state transverse geometry fluctuations ( i.e. , sextupole and other azimuth multipoles ) coupled to radial expansion  @xcite , or as resulting from interaction of initial - state `` glasma flux tubes '' coupled to radial flow  @xcite .",
    "interpretations based on initial - state overlap geometry ( the subject of this article ) typically invoke a fourier series to describe 2d angular correlations projected onto 1d azimuth .",
    "the fourier sinusoids are interpreted to represent `` higher harmonic flows ''  @xcite .",
    "however , the 1d projection onto azimuth which is central to such arguments discards critical information contained in the pseudorapidity structure .",
    "a discrete fourier series can describe any structure projected onto periodic azimuth .",
    "a gaussian peak narrow on azimuth must contribute significantly to several 1d fourier terms .",
    "but the ss 2d peak contribution should ( and can ) be distinguished from other 2d structure based on its strong pseudorapidity variation ( curvature ) .    in this analysis",
    "we invoke measured systematics of the minimum - bias ( @xmath2-integral ) ss 2d peak for 200 gev collisions to demonstrate that recently - reported @xmath3 measurements correspond to properties of the ss peak . from systematics of the peak properties we can predict any higher harmonic flow @xmath3 ( fourier coefficient ) as a function of centrality and _ @xmath0 exclusion cuts _ meant to remove `` nonflow '' from @xmath4 measurements .    in and more - peripheral collisions",
    "the ss 2d peak conforms closely to expectations for minimum - bias jets  @xcite .",
    "based on comparison of spectra , correlations and pqcd calculations we conclude that the ss peak continues to represent jet production even in more - central collisions  @xcite .",
    "the most likely interpretation of the ss peak mechanism in more - central collisions remains parton scattering and fragmentation , with modification of fragmentation including @xmath0 elongation ( polarization ) of lower - momentum jet fragments .",
