    "massive stars ( o and b stars with masses in excess of @xmath10m@xmath11 ) dominate the energy output of newly formed stellar populations . most of the energy is emitted in the form of ( ionising ) radiation , followed by supernova explosions ( about one order of magnitude less ) and stellar winds ( another order of magnitude less ) .",
    "photoionising radiation ( photon energies larger than @xmath12ev ) is a major source of ionised hydrogen and drives the formation of h  ii  regions ( e.g. @xcite ) , which cool by lyman @xmath5 radiation .",
    "this effect is significant although , energetically , the coupling of gas and radiation is usually very inefficient ( less than @xmath13% of the emitted energy in the lyman continuum can be converted into kinetic energy , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "photoionising radiation is also a major source for h@xmath5 emission , which is used as one of the major tracers for star formation in galaxies at low and high redshifts ( e.g. @xcite )    how radiation couples to the surrounding gas depends on the wavelength of the radiation , and energies below the lyman continuum also have to be considered .",
    "for example , photoelectric heating of dust ( photon energies of @xmath14ev ",
    "@xmath12ev ) is the dominant heat source in the interstellar medium ( ism , * ? ? ?",
    "it can lead to temperatures of a few @xmath15k and contribute to the formation of the warm , neutral component of the ism ( wnm ) , where the fine - structure lines [ c  ii ] and [ o  i ] are the main coolants .",
    "in addition , photodissociating radiation ( photon energies of @xmath16ev ",
    "@xmath12ev ) will destroy molecular hydrogen and change the abundance ratios .",
    "photoionising radiation from massive stars can heat the ism to temperatures up to @xmath17k and impacts the chemistry and thermodynamics of the cold neutral , the warm neutral , and the warm ionised medium directly . the cold neutral medium",
    "( in particular molecular hydrogen ) is the fuel for new stars and correlates well with the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies at low as well as high redshifts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "supernovae and to some degree stellar winds are energetic enough to shock - heat the ism to temperatures of @xmath18k and generate hot gas @xcite for which bremsstrahlung emission becomes the dominant cooling radiation .",
    "it has been argued that supernova - driven shocks play a significant role for driving ism turbulence @xcite , accumulate dense and cold gas and form a hot , possibly volume - filling , medium which is responsible for driving galactic outflows ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the emission of ionising radiation , stellar winds and supernova explosions are therefore the dominant sources that determine the chemo - thermodynamic properties of the ism .",
    "they should all be considered in modern attempts to improve the numerical modelling towards a more complete model of the ism .",
    "significant progress has been made on individual aspects .",
    "simulations focusing on the impact of supernovae on ism structure @xcite indicate a regulation of star formation and vertical disc structure in models limited to momentum injection ( e.g. @xcite ) as well as the formation of galactic outflows in simulations including the formation of a hot phase ( e.g. ) .",
    "stellar winds impact the ambient ism structure , possibly terminating gas accretion onto star - forming regions and thereby regulating the local efficiency of star formation @xcite .",
    "they also change the conditions for subsequent supernova explosions by reducing the ambient gas densities making energy deposition from supernovae more efficient .",
    "ionising radiation has a similar effect by heating the dense gas phase in star - forming regions to @xmath19k , injecting momentum into the ism , and driving turbulence locally @xcite .    in this paper",

    "in contrast , run fsn has a significantly larger disc scale height at the same time as the other two simulations , as we show in figure  [ fig : fsn ] .",
    "there is even more hot gas present than in run fwsn . because of the larger column of ionised gas , run fsn has a slightly enhanced h@xmath5 emission compared to run fwsn .",
    "since the simulation fsn is the only run that produces a volume filling fraction of hot gas in excess of @xmath83% ( see section  [ sec : vff ] ) , only this simulation drives a significant galactic outflow over an extended period of time @xcite .",

    ". instead , an ob star emits ionising radiation during its entire lifetime , not only when it has just formed .",
    "therefore , we get a much better estimate of the observed sfr when we distribute the @xmath43m@xmath9 of newly formed stars over the lifespan of the massive star associated with this cluster . the sfrs computed in this way are shown as solid lines in figure  [ fig : sfr ] .",
    "one can clearly see how this sfr declines after star formation events .",
    "this signifies the death of very massive stars ( @xmath87m@xmath9 ) with short lifetimes ( less than @xmath88myr ) .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath89m@xmath9 star lives for @xmath90myr before it explodes as supernova .",
    "because of the shape of the imf , these stars at the lower end of the high - mass slope of the imf are the most abundant stars in the clusters .",
    "therefore , the sfr always remains positive at a significant level after the first star formation event , since these stars provide a floor to the observed sfr .",
    "comparing the three simulations in figure  [ fig : sfr ] , there are some notable differences . in run",
    "fsn , star formation events occur steadily from the onset of star formation at @xmath65myr until we stop the simulation at @xmath91myr . in contrast , runs fwsn and frwsn display many fewer star formation events . as a result ,",
    "the averaged sfr in these simulations is reduced by one order of magnitude compared to run fsn .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is the self - regulation of star formation by early feedback ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "for the first few myr after their formation , the sink particles in this simulation can accrete unimpededly because no supernovae have exploded yet .",
    "in contrast , in run fwsn , stellar winds start blowing away the material close to the sink particle immediately after its formation . as a consequence ,",
    "the final sink particle masses are reduced by one order of magnitude , and the typical timespan of sink particle accretion is reduced to only @xmath96 to @xmath86myr . in run frwsn , where photoionisation feedback raises the thermal pressure by two orders of magnitude compared to the surrounding molecular gas , accretion is stopped even more efficiently . here ,",
    "the majority of sink particles have masses around @xmath15m@xmath9 and accrete for only @xmath13myr .",
    "it is important to note that both wind and radiation feedback are steady processes that commence with the first star formation event and only cease when all stars in the cluster are gone .",
    "therefore , strong infall onto the sink particle is necessary to quench this feedback to the extent that accretion can continue for more than @xmath86myr , or to facilitate a second episode of star formation after the sink particle already contains a substantial population of stars .",

    "we can compare our sfr surface density to the observational data of @xcite . for normal star - forming spiral galaxies with @xmath32m@xmath29pc@xmath30 ,",
    "the average sfr surface density is around @xmath97m@xmath29yr@xmath98kpc@xmath30 , which corresponds to the kennicutt - schmidt value .",

    "the time - averaged sfr in run frwsn is slightly lower than in run fwsn , indicating that early feedback by radiation is only responsible for a small additional reduction on top of the already substantial lowering of the sfr by stellar winds .",

    "in particular , while run fsn has a substantial population of very massive stars with @xmath87m@xmath9 , runs fwsn and frwsn only have very few such stars .",
    "however , since both wind and radiative energy output are a steep and highly non - linear function of stellar mass ( compare figure  [ fig : tracks ] ) , this small population still dominates the amount of energy injected into the ism . we quantify this effect in section  [ sec : enin ] .",
    "we can study the impact of the different forms of stellar feedback on the ism by considering the associated energies . figure  [ fig : einjsnwinds ] shows the cumulative energy injected by supernova explosions @xmath101 as a function of time @xmath85 for the three simulations . since run fsn forms roughly ten times more stars than the simulations with early feedback fwsn and frwsn , @xmath101 is increased by a similar factor .",
    "as we have already seen , the sfr in runs fwsn and frwsn does not differ much , and therefore @xmath101 is comparable in these simulations , too .",

    "figure  [ fig : sndist ] shows the cumulative distribution of supernovae as a function of the mean environmental density @xmath105 in which they explode , normalised to the total number of supernova explosions . in run fsn , essentially all supernovae go off at a mean density around @xmath106g@xmath2 , which is two orders of magnitude lower than the threshold density for sink particle formation @xmath42 . in simulation fwsn , where stellar winds blow the dense gas out of the supernova injection region , the distribution function becomes much broader .",
    "the lowest mean density reached is only @xmath107g@xmath2 , and the median of the distribution is @xmath108g@xmath2 .",

    "we find that photoionisation feedback contributes to the regulation of star formation by an increase in thermal pressure that the accretion flow around the star cluster must overcome to continue growing .",
