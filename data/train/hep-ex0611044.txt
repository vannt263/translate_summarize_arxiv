    "inclusive semileptonic decays of @xmath1  mesons to charmed final states provide an avenue for measuring the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element  @xmath5  @xcite and for determining non - perturbative hadronic properties of the @xmath1  meson . in particular ,",
    "the moments of the hadronic mass in @xmath6  decays calculated in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) and the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite depend on the @xmath7-quark mass ( @xmath8 ) and a few non - perturbative matrix elements that also appear in the expression of the total semileptonic width .",
    "thus , measurements of the hadronic invariant mass moments  @xcite allow the determination of these non - perturbative parameters from the data and reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath5 from measurements of the semileptonic branching fraction .",
    "an improved knowledge of @xmath8 also results in a more precise determination of @xmath9 from inclusive charmless semileptonic @xmath1  decays .",
    "this analysis uses @xmath10  events in which the hadronic decay of one @xmath1  meson is fully reconstructed .",
    "the semileptonic decay of the other @xmath1 is inferred from the presence of an identified lepton ( electron or muon ) amongst the remaining particles in the event .",
    "we calculate the first two moments of the hadronic invariant mass squared ( @xmath0 ) distribution  @xcite directly from the measured spectrum after the effects of finite detector resolution have been removed using the singular value decomposition algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the measurement described in this paper improves the results previously reported by the babar and cleo collaborations  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath8 and other non - perturbative parameters is increased by lowering the minimum lepton energy threshold to 0.7  gev .",
    "finally , this analysis minimizes the dependence on particular @xmath6  model assumptions by calculating the moments directly from the unfolded @xmath0  spectrum .",
    "the data used in this analysis were taken with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb asymmetric energy @xmath11  collider  @xcite .",
