    "however , it has been shown in several papers @xcite that by engineering suitable pairs of the system operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the state @xmath4 can be uniquely moved to a pure steady state .",
    "this means that a desired pure state can be deterministically generated without specific initialization of the system .",
    "we actually find some applications of this environment engineering approach to entangled state generation @xcite and further some advanced quantum information processing such as quantum computation @xcite , memories @xcite , and distillation @xcite .",

    "the auxiliary system couples to the environment locally , whereas it couples to the target system in a quasilocal manner through a certain hamiltonian . ,",
    "width=302 ]    here we mention the quasilocal interaction",
    ". an operator is called quasilocal if it acts only on a given site of the system and its neighborhood ; particularly in this paper we call the interaction quasilocal if it occurs between only two nodes . in the case of a quantum oscillator network",
    "whose @xmath3th node is a single - mode oscillator of variable @xmath5 , an example of a quasilocal coupling is @xmath6 .",
    "however , to generate a desired pure state such as a highly entangled state via the above - mentioned dissipation - based method , the system is often required to have non - quasilocal ( global ) interaction with the environment .",
    "let us consider a seven - node quantum oscillator network depicted in fig .",
    "this network has internal couplings among the nodes @xmath7-@xmath8 and @xmath9-@xmath10 through a hamiltonian @xmath1 in addition two global couplings of the nodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 to the environments , the operators of which are , for instance , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . from a practical viewpoint , clearly",
    "this kind of global interaction is hard to implement .",
    "actually , there have been several proposals to engineer a dissipative system having a quasilocal interaction with the environment , which yet deterministically produces a useful pure state . for instance , it was shown in ref @xcite that a qubit two - dimensional cluster state can be generated via a quasilocal dissipative process and ref . @xcite demonstrated the case of a uniformly distributed entangled state .",
    "moreover , for general finite - dimensional systems , ticozzi and viola provided a condition to determine whether a given pure state can be stabilized under fixed locality constraints @xcite .",
    "however , in the infinite - dimensional case , only a few specific results have been reported @xcite .",
    "the result obtained in ref @xcite is that for any pure gaussian state we can always engineer an open gaussian system whose unique steady state is identical to that pure state .",
    "however , as mentioned above , this open gaussian system often has to have a global interaction with the environment , such as the system shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in this paper ,",
    "nonetheless , we show that an arbitrary pure gaussian state can be dissipatively generated in a certain extended system having only local interaction with the environment .",
    "the idea is described as follows .",
    "first , we couple the underlying target system , via a set of two - body hamiltonians , to a certain auxiliary system having local interactions with the environment .",
    "that is , the extended open system composed of the target and the auxiliary systems contains only quasilocal interactions [ see fig .  1  ( b ) ]",
    "then , based on the result of ref @xcite , we will show that a gaussian pure state generated in the original system of interest , which can include global interactions with the environment , is also generated in the above - mentioned extended system .",
    "this configuration is actually a generalization of the result of ref @xcite , where dissipation - induced generation of a two - mode squeezed state in atomic ensembles was demonstrated .",
    "in addition , we present a simple schematic that only utilizes a single - mode auxiliary system .",
    "more specifically , even in the case where the above - mentioned result requires us to have a multimode auxiliary system , it will be shown that only a single - mode auxiliary system can serve to achieve the same goal .",
    "the key idea is the use of a switching scheme of the auxiliary system ; that is , in the case of the system depicted in fig .  1 , a single - mode auxiliary system first couples to the subsystems @xmath15 and then switches to couple to the subsystems @xmath16 .",
    "a particularly important result is that , with this switching scheme , an arbitrary approximate gaussian cluster state @xcite can be generated dissipatively .",
    "this is a generalization of the switching scheme proposed by li  _ et al . _ in ref @xcite , which demonstrated dissipative generation of several types of four - mode cluster states in an actual physical setup .",
    "finally , we examine how much a specific dissipation - induced pure state is robust against some perturbation .",
    "the system is a pair of two atomic ensembles that dissipatively generates a two - mode squeezed state @xcite ; here damping decoherence and parameter uncertainty are further taken into account .",
    "then we find the optimal system parameters that maximize the entanglement between the atomic ensembles .",
    "a point worth noting is that these optimal parameters are out of the range where the auxiliary cavity mode can be adiabatically eliminated ; that is , this is an example where the extended system is really robust against some perturbation compared to only the target system obtained through the adiabatic elimination .    _",

    "in addition to the underlying target system consisting of @xmath42 quantum oscillators , we consider an auxiliary system consisting of @xmath69 oscillators .",
    "let @xmath38^\\top$ ] and @xmath70^\\top$ ] be the vectors of canonical conjugate pairs of each system .",
    "we assume that the decoherence of the target system is negligible , i.e. , the system operators are @xmath71 where @xmath45 .",

    "all of the above results , including the switching law of the parameters of the interaction hamiltonian , have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we have shown the same result from a general standpoint .",
    "that is , from the general theory developed in secs .",
    "[ switching scheme ] and [ cv cluster state ] , now we know that any approximate gaussian cluster state can be deterministically generated in atomic ensembles trapped in a single - mode cavity .",
    "moreover , as demonstrated here , the appropriate switching law can be systematically constructed , once the target cluster state is specified .",
    "in this section , we reconsider the two atomic ensembles discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : epr ] , taking into account some specific perturbations added to the system .",
    "actually , an atomic ensemble constructed in a cavity often loses coherence due to spontaneous emission .",
    "in addition to this kind of quantum effect , in practice any system contains some parameter uncertainties , which can bring a serious loss of coherence as well when aiming to dissipatively generate a pure state . in the case of an atomic ensemble ,",
    "the number of atoms is usually never determined exactly .",
    "we take these two typical perturbations and evaluate how much the steady state is affected by these losses . in particular , we find the optimal squeezing level and the cavity damping rate that maximize the entanglement .",
    "although these investigations do not straightforwardly provide new insight into the quasilocality discussed throughout this paper , the result will clarify a merit of enlarging the system rather than focusing only on the target system obtained by adiabatic elimination .       versus the squeezing level @xmath156 and the cavity damping rate @xmath126 for the cases ( a ) @xmath248 , ( b ) @xmath249 , and ( c ) @xmath250 .",
    ", width=226 ]    first we assume that the atomic ensembles are subjected to a loss of atomic coherence , in which case the corresponding coupling operator is represented by @xmath251^\\top$ ] , with @xmath252 the decoherence rate .",
    "the coefficient matrix of the driving term of the system , given in eq .",
    ", is then changed to @xmath253 where @xmath254 is defined via eq .  .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath62 are given by @xmath255 a notable point is that , when large squeezing is introduced , i.e. , @xmath256 , the eigenvalue @xmath257 approaches zero , even in the case @xmath258 .",
    "this loss of stability of the system implies that a desirable convergence of the state is prevented .",
    "thus the perturbation @xmath259 is not negligible , particularly when aiming to generate a large entangled state .",
    "now the coefficient matrix of the diffusion term of the system is @xmath260 and the lyapunov equation @xmath261 has the following explicit solution : @xmath262 where @xmath263 . here , for simplicity , we have replaced @xmath264 and @xmath265 by @xmath126 and @xmath252 , respectively .",
    "the entanglement of this two - mode gaussian state can be quantified by the logarithmic negativity @xcite and is given by @xmath266 }                   { 2(\\kappa + \\gamma)[\\kappa \\gamma + 4(1-r^2)]}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figure [ fig : neg ] shows @xmath267 versus the squeezing level @xmath156 and the cavity damping rate @xmath126 , for the cases where the decoherence rate @xmath252 takes the values ( a ) @xmath248 and ( b ) @xmath249 . in the former case ( a ) , since there is no decohering effect , the steady state is pure with maximal entanglement @xmath268 without respect to @xmath126 ; i.e. , large squeezing directly means large entanglement .",
    "however , once the system is subjected to the decoherence , the steady - state entanglement drastically degrades , even for a very small decoherence rate @xmath249 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : neg ]  ( b ) .",
    "in particular , it is apparent from the figure that large squeezing brings about a large loss of entanglement , which is yet consistent with the fact that a large squeezed state is usually very fragile to decoherence .",
    "it is also reasonable that now @xmath126 affects @xmath267 in two ways : large @xmath126 induces rapid leaking of the photons through the cavity light field , while small @xmath126 means that the cavity mode interacts with the atomic ensembles many times , implying many emissions of the photons into the cavity field .",
    "consequently , there exists an optimal set of the parameters @xmath126 and @xmath269 that maximizes @xmath267 : @xmath270 where @xmath271^{1/3}$ ] . particularly in the case",
    "@xmath249 , these optimal values are given by @xmath272 and @xmath273 , and @xmath267 then takes the value of about @xmath274 .    _",
    "remark 4_. it should be pointed out that the above optimal parameters are out of the range where the auxiliary cavity mode can be adiabatically eliminated ; that is , as discussed in remark  1 in sec .",
    "[ sec : extended ] , the auxiliary system can be adiabatically eliminated only when @xmath126 is sufficiently large , but clearly in this case @xmath267 goes down to zero . in this sense ,",
    "the system studied here provides an example where the extended system is really robust against decoherence compared to only the target system obtained through adiabatic elimination .",
    "since the condition imposing the system to have a pure steady state is described by a set of algebraic equations , it is easily violated by some parameter changes . in the case of the atomic system under consideration",
    ", the numbers of atoms of each ensemble must be exactly the same , i.e. , @xmath275 , but it is fairly unrealistic . hence let us examine here how much the difference between @xmath276 and @xmath277 affects the entanglement of the steady state .",
    "we particularly set @xmath278 ; as usual , the number of trapped atoms is of order @xmath279 , and such relatively large uncertainty ( 10@xmath280 ) can actually happen .",
    "figure [ fig : neg]-(c ) shows the logarithmic negativity @xmath267 , where the decoherence due to the spontaneous emission discussed in the preceding section is additionally taken into account . as expected , further degradation of the entanglement is observed and in almost all ranges of the parameters @xmath241 and @xmath126 the state is no longer entangled .",
    "nevertheless , surprisingly , it is not a uniform degradation ; actually , as in the previous case , by engineering the system with optimal parameters @xmath281 , we obtain a steady state that still has a relatively large entanglement of @xmath282 , which is only a 17@xmath280 loss of entanglement compared to the ideal value of @xmath283 , where there is no uncertainty ( i.e. , @xmath284 ) . in other words , by constructing the system with these parameters @xmath281 , we can guarantee the entangled state with at least @xmath282 , against the uncertainty of the difference of the number of atoms up to 10@xmath280 .",
    "this robustness property indicates the possible effectiveness of the dissipation - based method for state preparation even in a realistic situation , as long as the system parameters are appropriately determined .",
    "the main results of this paper are twofold : first , we have shown that an arbitrary gaussian pure state can be deterministically generated via the local dissipative environment , by constructing an appropriate auxiliary system .",
    "second , we have shown that , even when only a single - mode auxiliary system is available , a well - tuned switching scheme allows us to stabilize any approximate gaussian cluster state in a dissipative way .",
    "the former is a generalization of the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that yields a dissipation - induced two - mode squeezed state , while the latter is that of ref .",
    "@xcite where deterministic generation of several four - mode cluster states was demonstrated .",
    "the essential mechanism for bringing quasilocality to the system considered in this paper is that , for a gaussian system , any interaction hamiltonian is always a sum of two - body ( hence quasilocal ) hamiltonians .",
    "this implies that as long as this kind of interaction hamiltonian is taken when constructing an auxiliary system , any non - gaussian ( target ) system couples to the environment quasilocally .",
    "this would be an interesting approach to explore a general method of constructing a desired quasilocal dissipative environment for general non - gaussian systems ."
