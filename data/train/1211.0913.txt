    "a small number of exact solutions to the schrdinger equation were obtained historically in the genesis of quantum mechanics.@xcite more recently , other exactly - soluble systems have been found by both traditional means@xcite and via the factorization techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy).@xcite conventionally , analytical solutions to the schrdinger equation were found via a reduction to a hypergeometric equation,@xcite an equation with three regular singular points , however recently a new solution via heun s differential equation@xcite has been reported.@xcite    heun s equation , a fuchsian equation with four regular singular points , was initially studied by the german mathematician karl heun in the late 19th century.@xcite it has several special or limiting cases of great importance in mathematical physics , namely the lam , mathieu and spheroidal differential equations.@xcite however , it is only recently that its use in physics has become increasingly widespread,@xcite with its solutions being used in works ranging from quantum rings@xcite to black holes.@xcite    in this work , we report a class of confining potentials that can be transformed to the confluent heun equation from the one - dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "one case , of a hyperbolic double - well , allows one to reduce the solution to simple polynomials for special values of the system parameters .",
    "the double - well problem has been studied extensively@xcite and is of continued interest due to its importance as a toy model , from heterostructure physics@xcite to the trapping of bose - einstein condensates.@xcite    please consider the following class of potentials , defined by two physical parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , shaping the potential depth and width respectively , and with two class parameters , with @xmath2 defining the family and @xmath3 @xmath4 most notable is the case @xmath5 , which describes the well - known pschl - teller potential.@xcite in fact , all constituent potentials of the families @xmath6 lead to schrdinger equations of no more than three singular points after a transformation of independent variable to @xmath7 or @xmath8 , and so can be reduced to equations of the hypergeometric type .",
    "termination of the resultant hypergeometric functions leads to analytic expressions for the eigenvalues of the problem .    however , when @xmath9 the same transformation variables lead to equations of the confluent heun type .",
    "now , two termination conditions must be satisfied in order to get a polynomial solution to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the @xmath10 family can not be terminated due to the first condition , which imposes a simple relation on the physical parameters arising in the problem .",
    "the @xmath11 family fulfill the first condition but not the second , more involved condition , which also must hold to abort the taylor series solution .",
    "however , remarkably the special case of @xmath12 is an exception and does admit polynomial solutions for certain values of the physical parameters , which will be the main focus of this work .",
    "the rest of this work is as follows .",
    "we give a full derivation of our solution in terms of confluent heun functions in sec .",
    "[ reduction ] , along with details of the power series solution . in sec .",
    "[ bound ] we provide the eigenvalues of our hyperbolic double - well problem , along with examples of the wavefunctions found for the first few states .",

    "@xmath40 there is a general theorem of quantum mechanics that tells us when the hamiltonian commutes with the parity operator , we should expect to find solutions of the schrdinger equation that are either symmetric or antisymmetric ( at least for non - degenerate states ) .",
    "we can see from eq .   that our solutions are wholly symmetric , as one would anticipate from the initial variable change to @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we seek an antisymmetric solution using the more convenient odd variable @xmath8,@xcite and we find @xmath41    in the next section , we shall look at the instances in which one can reduce the solution to a polynomial in @xmath25 or @xmath42 .",
    "please note , a derivation similar to the one above can be carried for single well cases @xmath43 and also in the second double - well case of @xmath44 for the @xmath45 family .",
    "the @xmath46 family is related by the fact in their respective confluent heun equations the parameter @xmath47 and parameters @xmath48 , frustrating termination attempts when employing the first termination condition . whilst this problem does not arise for the @xmath45 family ,",
    "the second termination condition can not be satisfied , thus the confluent heun functions arising in this case can not be reduced to polynomials either , except for the special @xmath12 case as we shall see .",
    "to reduce a confluent heun function to a confluent heun polynomial of degree @xmath49 we need two successive terms in the three - term recurrence relation eq .   to vanish , halting the infinite series eq .  .",
    "this requirement results in two termination conditions , which both need to be satisfied simultaneously@xcite    [ term ] @xmath50    the first condition arises from ensuring @xmath51 , and is equivalent to @xmath52 in the @xmath53 convention we use here , instead of the @xmath54 notation used by some other authors.@xcite the second condition , which can be written as a tridiagonal determinant ( please see appendix  [ appenda ] ) , arises from ensuring @xmath55 , such that it follows from eq .   that all further terms in the series vanish identically .",
    "in our case , the first termination condition eq .   allows us to find the following eigenvalue spectra    [ eigenvalues ] @xmath56    for the symmetric ( s ) and antisymmetric ( a ) solutions respectively . the second termination condition eq .   puts a constraint on the values the potential parameters @xmath57 and @xmath1 can take .",

    "the second termination condition eq .   can be re - written as the @xmath67 matrix @xmath68 which tells us what pair of values @xmath57 and @xmath1 can take .",
    "for simplicity , in what follows we choose @xmath69 , and upon solving eq .   via root - finding methods we find the special potential strengths @xmath70",

    "we see that the higher the potential strength the tighter the confinement and a decrease in nodes from two to zero ( although the factor @xmath72 in the wavefunction produces a superficial `` node '' at @xmath73 in the second case ) . carrying out the same analysis for the first antisymmetric state",
