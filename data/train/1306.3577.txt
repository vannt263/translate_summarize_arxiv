    "studies on partial differential equations , or pdes for brevity , are mostly focused on finding properties of pdes within a specific discipline and on developing a technique specialized to them . however , finding a common structure over different disciplines and unifying theories from different subjects into a generalized theory is the direction that mathematics should go in .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop geometric arguments to combine oleinik or aronson - benilan type one - sided estimates that arise from various disciplines from hyperbolic to parabolic problems .",
    "this unification of existing theories from different disciplines will provide a true generalization of such theories to a wider class of pdes .",
    "it is clear that algebraic or analytic formulas and estimates that depend on the specific pde can not provide such a unified theory and we need a different approach . in this paper",
    "we will see that a geometric structure of solutions may provide an excellent alternative in doing such a unification .",
    "the main example of this paper is the entropy solution of an initial value problem of a scalar conservation law , @xmath7 dafermos @xcite and hoff @xcite showed that , if the flux @xmath8 is convex , the entropy solution satisfies the oleinik inequality , @xmath9 in a weak sense .",
    "this is a sharp version of a one - sided inequality obtained by oleinik @xcite for a uniformly convex flux case .",
    "this inequality provides a uniqueness criterion and the sharp regularity for the admissible weak solution .",
    "however , if the flux is not convex , then the oleinik estimate fails .    one may find a similar theory from a different discipline of pdes , nonlinear diffusion equations , @xmath10 this equation",
    "is called the porous medium equation ( pme ) if @xmath11 with @xmath12 , the fast diffusion equation ( fde ) with @xmath13 , and the heat equation if @xmath14 . aronson and",
    "bnilan @xcite showed that , for @xmath15 , its solution satisfies a one - sided inequality @xmath16 this inequality played a key role in the development of nonlinear diffusion theory that the oleinik inequality did .",
    "the equation ( [ nonlineardiffusion ] ) is called the @xmath17-laplacian equation ( ple ) if @xmath18 with @xmath19 and its solution satisfies a similar one - sided inequality . however , these inequalities depend on the homogeneity of the function @xmath20 .",
    "the oleinik inequality for hyperbolic conservation laws and the aronson - benilan type inequalities for porous medium or p - laplacian equations are one - sided inequalities that provide key features of solutions such as the uniqueness and sharp regularity .",
    "even though these key inequalities are from different disciplines of pdes , they reflect the very same phenomenon .",
    "however , this kind of one - sided estimates do not hold without convexity or homogeneity assumption of the problem .",
    "such a key estimate for a general situation has been the missing ingredient to obtain theoretical progress for a long time in related disciplines .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a unified and generalized version of such one - sided inequalities for a general first or second order differential equation in the form of @xmath21 where the sub - indices stand for partial derivatives and the initial value @xmath22 is nonnegative and bounded .",
    "the main hypothesis on @xmath23 is the parabolicity , @xmath24 which is not necessarily uniformly parabolic . here",
    ", we denote @xmath25 and @xmath26 by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the solution of ( [ eqn ] ) is not unique in general .",
    "for example , the conservation law ( [ c law ] ) is in this form with @xmath29 and its weak solution is not unique .",
    "however , it is well known that the zero viscosity limit of a conservation law is the entropy solution . for",
    "the wide class of problems in ( [ eqn ] ) , one can still consider zero - viscosity limits as follows .",
    "let @xmath30 be small and @xmath31 be the solution to a perturbed problem @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are smooth perturbations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , and @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35 if @xmath23 is smooth , one may simply put @xmath36 .",
    "in fact @xmath34 is required to be @xmath37 with respect to @xmath28 , @xmath38 with respect to @xmath17 , and @xmath39 with respect to @xmath40 . for a conservation law case",
    ", @xmath41 is already smooth enough and such a perturbation is standard . the convergence of the perturbed problem is known for many cases including pme and ple .",
    "the focus of this paper is the structure of the limit of @xmath42 as @xmath43 and hence we assume such a convergence .",
    "let @xmath5 be a nonnegative fundamental solution of ( [ eqn ] ) with mass @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath44 the idea for the unification of the one - sided inequalities comes from the observation that they are actually comparisons with fundamental solutions , where a fundamental solution satisfies the equality .",
    "for example , the oleinik inequality can be written as @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , the aronson - bnilan inequality becomes @xmath47 for all @xmath46 .",
    "this observation indicates that the unified version of such one - sided inequalities should be a comparison with fundamental solutions .",
    "the unification process is to find the basic common feature , which will be given in terms of geometric concept of connectedness of a level set .",
    "first we introduce the connectedness of the zero level set in a modified way .",
    "[ def.connectedness ] the zero level set @xmath48 is connectable by adding zeros , or simply connectable , if there exists a connected set @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .    in other words ,",
    "if we can connect the zero level set @xmath48 by adding a part of zeros of the function @xmath51 , we call it connectable or simply connected . for example , if the graph of @xmath52 is as given in figure [ fig0 ] , its zero level set is connectable by adding zeros .",
    "in other words we are actually interested in sign changes . in this paper",
    "the connectedness the level set is always in this sense .",
    "notice that , for a uniformly parabolic case that @xmath53 , the usual connectedness is just enough .",
    "however , to include the case @xmath54 , we need to generalize the connectedness as in the definition .",
    "of the function @xmath51 in the figure is not connected .",
    "the set @xmath55 is not connected neither .",
    "however , the set @xmath56 is connectable by adding zeros in the sense of definition [ def.connectedness].,width=264 ]    finally , we are ready to present the unified version of the one - sided inequalities .",
    "[ thm.generalization ] let @xmath57 be the nonnegative zero - viscosity solution of ( [ eqn])-([positivity ] ) , @xmath58 be the fundamental solution with mass @xmath6 , and @xmath59 . then , the zero level set @xmath60 is connectable for all @xmath61 and @xmath4 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm.generalization ] is given in section [ sect.proofofmaintheorem ] using the zero set theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "main parts of this paper come after the proof .",
    "it is shown that the connectedness of the level set is equivalent to the oleinik inequality for a conservation law with a convex flux , theorem [ thm.equi1 ] , and the aronson - benilan inequality for the porous medium and the fast diffusion equation , theorem [ thm.equi2 ] . in this way",
    "we may see that the connectedness of the level set is a true unification of the one - sided inequalities from different disciplines .",
    "the estimates for solutions of pdes are usually obtained by using analytical relations , but not geometrical ones .",
    "however , the geometric approach in this paper will show that they are equally useful and convenient .",
    "in fact , in certain situations , geometric relations provide simple and intuitive way to estimate solutions .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to develop geometric approaches to estimate solutions of pdes . in section [ sect.steepness ] ,",
    "the connectivity of the zero level set in theorem [ thm.generalization ] is developed to obtain geometric steepness estimates of the solution .",
    "a bounded solution is compared to fundamental solutions in theorem [ thm.steepness ] .",
    "the steepness comparison can be considered as an estimate of solution gradients .",
    "however , in a delicate situation as in the theorem , geometric arguments may provide a relatively simple and intuitive way to estimate of solutions which is not possible by usual analytical approaches .",
    "the steepness comparison is used as a key to show the uniqueness of the solution to a conservation law without convexity in theorem [ thm.uniquenessclaw ] .",
    "it is shown in the theorem that , if the zero level set in theorem [ thm.generalization ] is connected for all fundamental solutions , it is the unique entropy solution even without the convexity assumption .",
    "this steepness comparison also shows that the total variation of the solution is uniformly bounded for any given time and bounded domain in theorem [ thm.tvb ] .",
    "such an estimate is well known for a convex flux case , where the oleinik inequality is the key for the estimate .",
    "hence it is not surprising that the geometric generalization of the oleinik inequality gives a similar tv estimation without the convexity assumption .",
    "the challenge of the geometric approach of this paper is to extend it to multi - dimensions .",
    "the main difficulty is that there is no multi - dimensional version of a lap number theory nor a zero set theory .",
    "in fact , the number of connected components of zero level set has no monotonicity property , which is the reason why there is no multi - dimensional version of such theories .",
    "however , our interest is a special case of comparing a general bounded solution @xmath57 to a fundamental solution @xmath58 .",
    "such connectedness will provide the steepness comparison for multi - dimensions .",
    "in fact , it is proved in theorem [ thm.heateqn ] that the level set is convex for the heat equation . a brief discussion for an extension of theory to multi - dimensions is given in section [ sect.rn ] .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm.generalization ] . the proof depends on the monotone decrease of the lap number or the number of zero points ( see @xcite ) . for an equation in a divergence form ,",
    "the lap number theory is more convenient .",
    "since our equation ( [ eqn ] ) is in a non - divergence form , the zero set theory is more convenient .",
    "the following lemma is a simplified version of angenent ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem b ) .",
    "[ lem.angenent88 ] let @xmath62 be a nontrivial bounded solution to @xmath63 where @xmath64 for some @xmath30 and @xmath65 are bounded .",
    "then , for all @xmath66 , the zeros of @xmath62 are discrete and the number of zeros are decreasing as @xmath67",
    ".    we will apply this lemma to the difference @xmath68 and show that the zero level set @xmath69 is connected ( or connectable ) for all @xmath66 .",
    "the number of sign changes of @xmath62 for a small @xmath66 is at most two since @xmath58 is a delta sequence as @xmath70 and @xmath71 is bounded and nonnegative .",
    "hence what we need is a special case of the zero set theory .",
    "notice that the zero set is just the boundary of the zero level set and hence the theory can be written in terms of the number of connected components of the zero level set .",
    "this is the idea that can be naturally extended to multi - dimensions .",
    "the following corollary is the one we need for our purpose .",
    "[ cor.zeroset ] under the same assumptions in lemma [ lem.angenent88 ] , @xmath72 is connected for all @xmath66 if @xmath73 is connected .",
    "if @xmath74 or @xmath75 , then the initial value @xmath76 has no zero point . therefore , @xmath62 has no zero for all @xmath66 by the zero set theory ( or by the maximum principle ) and hence @xmath77 is also connected .",
    "suppose that @xmath73 is a half real line .",
    "then , @xmath62 has at most one zero and hence @xmath77 is also connected .",
    "suppose that @xmath73 is a bounded interval .",
    "then , @xmath62 has at most two zero points .",
    "if @xmath62 has no or a single zero , then @xmath77 is connected .",
    "let @xmath62 has two zeros , @xmath78 .",
    "then , the zero set theory implies that @xmath79 has two zeros @xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath62 has the same sign on the domain bounded by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath77 is an interval and hence connected .",
    "@xmath86    consider a solution @xmath57 of @xmath87 where the initial value @xmath22 is nonnegative and bounded .",
    "we consider a parabolic case that satisfies @xmath88 in this notation , @xmath89 is allowed to have @xmath90 dependency and hence is a generalized form of ( [ eqn])([positivity ] ) . for the uniqueness of the problem we consider the zero - viscosity limit as usual .",
    "let @xmath30 be small and @xmath31 be the solution to a perturbed problem @xmath91 where @xmath33 and @xmath92 are smooth perturbations of @xmath22 and @xmath89 , respectively , and @xmath92 satisfies @xmath93 notice that the perturbed problem is a special case of the original problem .",
    "hence the properties of the solutions of ( [ eqnx ] ) hold true for solutions of perturbed problem .",
    "however , certain properties hold for the perturbed problem only , which will be discussed below .",
    "the regularity of the solution @xmath94 of the perturbed pr:20oblem , the convergence to a weak solution @xmath95 as @xmath43 , and the uniqueness of the limit are known for several cases such as conservation laws , porous medium equations , and @xmath17-laplacian equations .",
    "we will call the limit as the zero - viscosity limit .",
    "however , there is no such a theory under the generality in ( [ eqnx]-[positivityx ] ) .",
    "therefore , to complete the theory for an individual equation , such a zero viscosity limit should be obtained first .",

    "hence we assume that @xmath42 and @xmath97 are smooth solutions of the perturbed problem that converges to @xmath98 and @xmath5 as @xmath43 , respectively .",

    "it is clear that the number of connected components of the zero level set @xmath111 is one for @xmath66 small since @xmath112 is a delta - sequence as @xmath70 and the initial value @xmath113 is bounded and smooth .",
    "therefore , corollary [ cor.zeroset ] implies that the set @xmath114 is connected for all @xmath61 and @xmath4 .",
    "next we show that the zero level set @xmath60 is connectable .",
