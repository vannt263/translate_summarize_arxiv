    "fractal dimensions such as hausdorff dimension , box - counting dimension and packing dimension are very useful in characterizing roughness or irregularity of stochastic processes and random fields which , in turn , serve as stochastic models in various scientific areas including image processing , hydrology , geostatistics and spatial statistics .",
    "many authors have studied the hausdorff dimension and exact hausdorff measure of the image sets of markov processes and gaussian random fields .",
    "we refer to taylor ( @xcite ) and xiao ( @xcite ) for extensive surveys on results and techniques for markov processes , and to adler ( @xcite ) and kahane ( @xcite ) for results on gaussian random fields .",
    "let @xmath6 be a random field with values in @xmath7 , which will simply be called an @xmath8__-random field__. for any finite borel measure @xmath2 on @xmath9 , the image measure of @xmath2 under @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , for every @xmath12 , the image set is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "this paper is concerned with the hausdorff and packing dimensions of the image measures and image sets of random fields which are , in a certain sense , comparable to a self - similar process . recall that @xmath14 is said to be @xmath15__-self - similar _ _",
    "if , for every constant @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 and @xmath10 is said to have _ stationary increments _ if , for every @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes equality of all finite - dimensional distributions .",
    "if @xmath10 satisfies both ( [ eq : ss0 ] ) and ( [ eq : si ] ) , then it is called an @xmath15__-sssi random field__. samorodnitsky and taqqu ( @xcite ) give a systematic account of self - similar stable processes .",
    "the main results of this paper show that the hausdorff and packing dimensions of the images of an @xmath15-sssi random field @xmath10 are determined by the self - similarity index @xmath15 and essentially do not depend on the distributions of @xmath10 .",
    "an important example of an @xmath15-sssi @xmath8-random field is fractional brownian motion @xmath21 of index @xmath15 @xmath22 , which is a centered gaussian random field with the covariance function @xmath23=\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{i , j } ( \\|s\\|^{2h}+\\|t\\|^{2h } -\\|t - s\\|^{2h } ) $ ] for all @xmath24 , where @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "it is well known ( see kahane ( @xcite ) , chapter 18 ) that for every borel set @xmath12 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the hausdorff dimension . on the other hand , talagrand and xiao ( @xcite ) proved that , when @xmath30 , the packing dimension analog of ( [ eq : bg60 ] ) fails in general .",
    "xiao ( @xcite ) proved that @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes packing dimension and @xmath33 is the packing dimension profile of @xmath34 defined by falconer and howroyd ( @xcite ) ( see section [ sec : pre ] for its definition ) .",
    "results ( [ eq : bg60 ] ) and ( [ eq : xiao97 ] ) show that there are significant differences between hausdorff dimension and packing dimension , and both dimensions are needed for characterizing the fractal structures of @xmath5 .",
    "there have been various efforts to extend ( [ eq : bg60 ] ) to other non - markovian processes or random fields , but with only partial success ; see kno ( @xcite ) , lin and xiao ( @xcite ) , benassi , cohen and istas ( @xcite ) and xiao ( @xcite ) . in order to establish a hausdorff dimension result similar to ( [ eq : bg60 ] ) for a random field @xmath10 ,",
    "it is standard to determine upper and lower bounds for @xmath35 separately .",
    "while the capacity argument ( based on frostman s theorem ) is useful for determining lower bounds , the methods based on the classical covering argument for establishing an upper bound for @xmath35 are quite restrictive and usually require strong conditions to be imposed on  @xmath10 . as such , the aforementioned authors have only considered random fields which either satisfy a uniform hlder condition of appropriate order on compact sets or have at least the first moment . in particular , the existing methods are not enough , even for determining @xmath36^n),$ ] when @xmath21 is a general stable random field .    given a random field @xmath37 and a borel set @xmath38 , it is usually more difficult to determine the packing dimension of the image set @xmath5 .",
    "recently , khoshnevisan and xiao ( @xcite ) and khoshnevisan , schilling and xiao ( @xcite ) have solved the above problem when @xmath39 is a lvy process in @xmath7 .",
    "however , their method depends crucially on the strong markov property of lvy processes and can not be applied directly to random fields .",
    "this paper is motivated by the need to develop methods for determining the hausdorff and packing dimensions of the image measure @xmath4 and image set @xmath5 under minimal conditions on the random field @xmath10 . by applying measure - theoretic methods and the theory of packing dimension profiles , we are able to solve the problems for the hausdorff and packing dimensions of the image measure @xmath4 under mild conditions ( namely , ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) in section [ sec : measures ] ) .",
    "the main results are theorem [ th : hdim1 ] and theorem [ th : main1 ] .",
    "when @xmath10 satisfies certain uniform hlder conditions , theorems [ th : hdim1 ] and [ th : main1 ] can be applied directly to compute the hausdorff and packing dimensions of @xmath5 .",
    "more generally , we also provide a method for determining the hausdorff dimension of @xmath5 under conditions ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) ( see theorem [ th : dimxe2 ] ) .",
    "however , we have not been able to solve the problem of determining @xmath40 in general .",

    "this is done by showing that there exists a positive function @xmath498 such that for all @xmath120 satisfying @xmath499 , we have @xmath500 this and the fourier inversion formula together imply that the density functions of @xmath501 are uniformly bounded for all @xmath502 satisfying @xmath499 .    since the coordinate processes @xmath503 are independent copies of @xmath475 , it is sufficient to prove ( [ eq : g ] ) for @xmath504 .",
    "note that , by ( [ eq : g ] ) , we can take @xmath505 for all @xmath506 .",
    "for any @xmath507 such that @xmath508 , condition ( [ con : psi ] ) implies that @xmath509\\\\[-8pt ] & \\ge & k |u|^\\delta\\int_{\\|\\xi\\| \\ge\\gamma\\|t - s\\|^{-1 } } \\psi\\biggl(\\frac{1 - \\cos\\langle t - s , \\xi\\rangle } { \\|t - s\\|^h \\|\\xi\\|^{h+{n}/{2 } } } \\biggr ) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\xi,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath510 is a constant whose value will be chosen later .    by a change of variable @xmath511",
    ", we see that the last integral becomes @xmath512\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\quad \\ge k \\int_{\\|\\eta\\| \\ge\\gamma } \\frac{(1 - \\cos\\langle ( t - s)/\\|t - s\\| , \\eta\\rangle)^2 } { \\|\\eta\\|^{2h+n } } \\,\\mathrm{d}\\eta,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the inequality follows from ( [ eq : psi - trun ] ) , and we have used the fact that @xmath133 and taken @xmath513 large .",
    "the last integral is a constant because the lebesgue measure is rotationally invariant .",
    "thus , we have proven that for @xmath508 , @xmath514 therefore , when @xmath504 , ( [ eq : g ] ) holds for the function @xmath515 defined as @xmath505 if @xmath516 and @xmath517 if @xmath518 this completes the proof of theorem [ th : rhflmimage ] .",
    "we mention that benassi , cohen and istas ( @xcite ) have introduced another interesting class of fractional lvy fields , namely , the moving average fractional lvy fields ( maflf ) . similarly to the contrast between linear fractional stable motion and harmonizable fractional stable motion ,",
    "many properties of maflf s are different from those of rhflm s .",
    "for example , the exponent of the uniform modulus of continuity of an maflf is strictly smaller than its local hlder exponent .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the arguments in this paper are applicable to maflf s .",
    "this and some related problems will be dealt with elsewhere .      given an integer @xmath519 and a constant @xmath520 , the hermite process @xmath521 of order @xmath385 is defined by @xmath522 where @xmath523 is a normalizing constant depending on @xmath385 and @xmath252 only and the integral @xmath524 is the @xmath385-tuple wiener ",
    "it integral with respect to the standard brownian motion excluding the diagonals @xmath525 , @xmath526 .",
    "the integral ( [ eq : hermite ] ) is also well defined if @xmath527 ; the process is a fractional brownian motion for which the problem considered in this paper has been solved .",
    "the hermite process @xmath528 is @xmath15-sssi and @xmath529 .",
    "it is a non - gaussian process and often appears in non - central limit theorems for processes defined as integrals or partial sums of nonlinear functionals of stationary gaussian sequences with long - range dependence ; see taqqu ( @xcite , @xcite ) , dobrushin and major ( @xcite ) and major ( @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from theorem 6.3 of taqqu ( @xcite ) that the hermite process @xmath528 has the following equivalent representation : @xmath530 where @xmath531 is a normalizing constant and @xmath532 is a centered complex gaussian random measure on @xmath381 with lebesgue measure as its control measure .",
    "mori and oodaira ( @xcite ) studied the functional laws of the iterated logarithms for the hermite process @xmath528 .",
    "lemma [ mwtail ] follows from lemma 6.3 in mori and oodaira ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ mwtail ] there exist positive constants @xmath533 and @xmath534 , depending on @xmath385 only , such that @xmath535 } |y^{m , \\kappa}(t)| \\ge u \\ } \\le \\exp(-k_{{5 , 6 } } u^{2/m } ) $ ] for all @xmath536    using lemma [ mwtail ] , one can derive easily a uniform modulus of continuity for @xmath528 .",
    "[ lem : modcon ] there exists a finite constant @xmath537 such that for all constants @xmath538 , @xmath539 where @xmath540 .    for every @xmath432 and @xmath347 , the self - similarity of @xmath528 and lemma [ mwtail ] together imply that @xmath541 hence , @xmath542 satisfies the conditions of lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 in cski and csrg ( @xcite ) with @xmath543 and @xmath544 .",
    "consequently , ( [ eq : uniform ] ) follows directly from theorem 3.1 in cski and csrg ( @xcite ) .    the case @xmath545 has recently received considerable attention .",
    "the process @xmath546 is called the _ rosenblatt process _ by taqqu ( @xcite ) ( or _ fractional rosenblatt motion _ by pipiras ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "its self - similarity index is given by @xmath547 .",
    "this non - gaussian process in many ways resembles fractional brownian motion .",
    "for example , since @xmath548 , fractional noise of @xmath546 exhibits long - range dependence .",
    "besides its connections to non - central limit theorems , the rosenblatt process also appears in limit theorems for some quadratic forms of random variables with long - range dependence .",
    "albin ( @xcite , @xcite ) has discussed distributional properties and the extreme value theory of @xmath546 . in particular , albin ( @xcite ) , section 16 , obtained sharp asymptotics on the tail probability of @xmath549}y^{2 , \\kappa}(t)$ ] . pipiras ( @xcite ) established a wavelet - type expansion for the rosenblatt process .",
    "tudor ( @xcite ) has recently developed a stochastic calculus for @xmath546 based on both pathwise type calculus and malliavin calculus .",
    "we now consider the rosenblatt process @xmath550 with values in @xmath7 by letting its component processes be independent copies of @xmath546 .",
    "the following result determines the hausdorff and packing dimensions of the image sets of @xmath550 .",
    "let @xmath551 be a rosenblatt process in @xmath7 as defined above .",
    "then , for every analytic set @xmath443 , we have @xmath552    by lemma [ lem : modcon ] , for any @xmath241 , @xmath550 satisfies a uniform hlder condition of order @xmath335 ( where @xmath553 ) on all compact intervals in @xmath254 . on the other hand , it is known that the random variable @xmath554 has a bounded and continuous density ( see davydov ( @xcite ) or albin ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "thus , @xmath550 also satisfies condition ( c2 ) with @xmath555 .",
    "therefore , the two equalities in ( [ eq : setfrm1 ] ) follow from theorem [ th : main2a ] .",
    "the authors thank professor davar khoshnevisan for stimulating discussions on packing dimension profiles , professors patrik albin , david nualart and frederi viens for very helpful suggestions on the rosenblatt process and the anonymous referee for comments and suggestions which have led to significant improvement of the manuscript .",
