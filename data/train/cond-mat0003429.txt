    "a large number of recent experimental publications on low temperature transport measurements in low - density high mobility two dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems in si mosfets@xcite , gaas modfets@xcite , and sige hetrostructures@xcite report an anomalously strong temperature dependent resistivity in the narrow regime of @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to the usual bloch - grneisen theory of essentially a temperature - independent low - temperature resistivity , the measured resistivity changes by as much as a factor of ten for a @xmath1 increase in temperature .",
    "this observed anomaly has led to a great deal of theoretical activity @xcite involving claims of an exotic metal or even a superconducting system at the interface producing the strong temperature dependent resistivity , which has no known analog in ordinary three dimensional metallic behavior .",
    "much more interest has focused around the possibility of a 2d metal - insulator quantum phase transition being responsible for the observed strong temperature dependent resistivity since theoretically a 2d electron system at t=0 has so far been thought to be ( at least in the absence of electron interaction effects ) an insulator @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a theoretical explanation for the temperature dependent resistivity of the 2d systems in the `` metallic '' phase ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the 2d density and @xmath4 the critical density which separates `` metallic '' and `` insulating '' behavior ) in the absence of magnetic field @xcite by using the drude - boltzmann transport theory with rpa screening and the dingle temperature approximation to incorporate collisional broadening effects on screening @xcite . in our approach",
    "we leave out quantum corrections , including localization effects , and neglect the inelastic electron - electron interaction , which may well be significant in the low density 2d systems of experimental relevance .",
    "our calculated resistivity agrees quantitatively with the existing experimental data @xcite on the temperature dependent low - density resistivity of 2d electron systems .",
    "we find that the strong temperature dependence arises from a combination of two effects : the strong temperature dependence of finite wave vector screening in 2d systems and a sharp quantum - classical crossover due to the low fermi temperature in the relevant 2d systems .",
    "we use the finite temperature drude - boltzmann theory to calculate the ohmic resistivity of the inversion layer electrons , taking into account only long range scattering by the static charged impurity centers with the screened electron - impurity coulomb interaction .",
    "the screening effect is included within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) with the finite temperature static rpa dielectric ( screening ) function @xmath5 given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the form factor for electron - electron interactions and @xmath8 is the static polarization .",
    "we assume that the charged impurity centers are randomly distributed in the plane parallel to the semiconductor - insulator surface . within the born approximation the scattering time @xmath9 for our model",
    "is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the impurity density of the charged center , @xmath13 is the scattering angle between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the 2d electron - impurity coulomb interaction . in calculating the coulomb interaction and the rpa dielectric function in eq . ( 1 ) we take into account subband quantization effects in the inversion layer through the lowest subband variational wavefunction .",
    "the resistivity is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the carrier effective mass , @xmath21 the effective free carrier density @xcite , and @xmath22 the energy averaged scattering time .",
    "the average is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath25/k_b t \\}^{-1}$ ] with finite temperature chemical potential , @xmath26 , which is determined self - consistently .",
    "it is physically instructive to first consider the asymptotic behavior of the temperature dependent part of resistivity , @xmath27 . in the quantum regime at low temperature , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , the dominant behavior of @xmath27 is linearly increasing with t , i.e. , @xmath30 arising from the temperature dependent screening , @xmath5 @xcite . in the high temperature limit",
    "@xmath31 corresponding to the classical regime , the resistivity is decreasing with temperature , i.e. , @xmath32 due to the energy averaging of @xmath33 . for intermediate temperatures ( @xmath34 ) the system crosses over from a non - degenerate classical to a strongly screened degenerate quantum regime @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we give our numerically calculated resistivity @xmath35 for the si-12 sample of ref . @xcite using the effective carrier density @xmath36 @xcite at several values of @xmath37 and different dingle temperatures .",
    "the impurity density , @xmath38 , sets the overall scale of resistivity ( @xmath39 ) , and does not affect the calculated @xmath40 and @xmath21 dependence of @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain , at low densities , both the observed non - monotonicity and the strong drop in @xmath27 in the @xmath41 temperature range@xcite .",
    "our high density results show weak monotonically increasing @xmath27 with increasing @xmath40 similar to experimental observations @xcite . in the inset",
    "we show the analytic zero temperature conductivity as a function of density @xmath3 , following the approach of ref .",
    "an approximately linear dependence is in a good agreement with the @xmath42 extrapolation of the experimental @xcite resistivity .",
    "obtained results suggest that the reduced effective density and not the total value contributes to conductivity and supports our basic freeze - out or binding model @xcite .",
    "these analytic results coincide with the full numerical calculation , further justifying validity of our methods .",
    "in conclusion we obtain good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of resistivity at low and intermediate densities ( @xmath43 ) arises from the temperature dependent screening and a low fermi temperature by virtue of the low effective carrier density .",
    "thus , charged impurity scattering , carrier binding and freeze - out , temperature and density dependence of 2d screening , and classical to quantum crossover are playing significant roles in the experiments and can not be neglected in theoretical analysis of the `` 2d m - i - t '' phenomenon .",
