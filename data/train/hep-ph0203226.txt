    "the standard model ( sm ) is a very successful theory of the elementary particles known today .",
    "but it must be incomplete because it has too many unpredicted parameters ( @xmath3 ) to be put by hand .",
    "most of these parameters are in the fermion part of the theory .",
    "we do nt know the source of the quarks and leptons , as well as how to determinate their mass and number theoretically .",
    "we have to get their information all from experiment .",
    "there is still no successful theory which can be descripted them with a unified point , even if the grand unified theory@xcite and supersymmetry@xcite",
    ". perhaps _ elementary particles _ have substructure and we need to progress more elementary theories . but this is beyond our current experimental level . on the other hand , the recent measurment of the muon anomalous magnetic moment by the experiment e821 @xcite disagrees with the sm expectations at more than 2.6@xmath4 level .",
    "there are convincing evdences that neutrinos are massive and oscillate in flavor @xcite .",
    "it seems to indicate the presence of new physics .    from the point of phenomenology , for fermions",
    ", there is a realistic question is number of the fermions generation or weather there are other additional quarks or leptons .",
    "the present experiments can tell us there are only three generation fermions with @xmath5 neutrinos which mass are less smaller than @xmath6@xcite but the experiments do nt exclude the existence of other additional generation , such as the fourth generation , with a @xmath7 neutrino , i.e. @xmath8@xcite .",
    "many refs . have studied models which extend the fermions part , such as vector - like quark models@xcite , sterile neutrino models@xcite and the sequential four generation standard model ( sm4)@xcite which we talk in this note .",
    "we consider a sequential fourth generation non -susy model@xcite , which is added an up - like quark @xmath9 , a down - like quark @xmath10 , a lepton @xmath11 , and a heavy neutrino @xmath12 in the sm .",
    "the properties of these new fermions are all the same as their corresponding counterparts of other three generations except their masses and ckm mixing , see tab.1 ,    .the elementary particle spectrum of sm4 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now , we can put the constraints of the fourth generation ckm factor @xmath13 from the present experimental value of @xmath14 .",
    "we change the form of eq .",
    "( 21 ) as a quadratic equation about @xmath13 . by solving it",
    ", we can get two analytical solution @xmath15 ( absolute value is the large one ) and @xmath16 ( absolute value is the small one ) . however , experimentally , it is not accurate for the measurement of ckm matrix element @xmath17@xcite .",
    "so , we have to search other ways to solve this difficulty .",
    "fortunately , the ckm unitarity triangle@xcite , i.e. the graphic representation of the unitarity relation for @xmath18 quarks , which come from the orthogonality condition on the first and third row of @xmath19 , @xmath20 can be conveniently depicted as a triangle relation in the complex plane , as shown in the following figure . from the above equation",
    ", we can give the constraints of @xmath21@xcite , @xmath22 then , we give the final results as shown in the figs .",
    "3 .    we must announce that figs .",
    "3 only show the curves with @xmath16 ( absolute value is the small one ) firstly . because the absolute value of @xmath23 is generally larger than 1 .",
    "this is contradict to the unitarity of ckm matrix .",
    "so , we do nt think about this solution . from the figs .",
    "3 , we found all curves are in the range from @xmath24 to @xmath25 when we considering the constraint of @xmath21 .",
    "that is to say , the absolute value of @xmath26 is about @xmath27 order .",
    "this is a very interesting result .",
    "these ckm matrix elements obey unitarity constraints . with the fourth generation quark @xmath9 , eq .",
    "( 9 ) change to , @xmath28 we take the average values of the sm ckm matrix elements from ref .",
    "the sum of the first three terms in eq .",
    "( 24 ) is about @xmath29 order . if we take the value of @xmath30 the result of the left of ( 26 ) is better and more close to @xmath31 than that in sm , when @xmath32 takes negative values .",
    "even if @xmath32 takes positive values , the sum of ( 26 ) would change very little because the values of @xmath16 are about @xmath33 order , two orders smaller than the sum of the first three ones in the left of ( 24 ) .",
    "considering that the data of ckm matrix is not very accurate , we can get the error range of the sum of these first three terms .",
    "it is much larger than @xmath16 .",
    "thus , in the case the values of @xmath26 satisfy the ckm matrix unitarity constraints .",
    "1.5 cm    we can see the order of these 4th generation ckm matrix elements , such as @xmath26 does nt contradict to the hierarchy of the ckm matrix elements or the quarks mixing angles@xcite .",
    "moreover , it seem to prove the hierarchy .",
    "the hierarchy in the quarks mixing angles is clearly presented in the wolfenstein parameterization@xcite of the ckm matrix .",
    "let s see ckm matrix firstly , @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "now , the hierarchy can be expressed in powers of @xmath36 .",
    "we found , the magnitudes of the mixing angles are about 1 among the @xmath37 generations , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . for different generations ,",
    "the magnitudes are about @xmath36 order between @xmath41 and @xmath42 generation , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as well as about @xmath45 order between @xmath42 and @xmath46 generation , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the magnitudes are about @xmath49 order between the @xmath41 and @xmath50 generation , @xmath51 and @xmath17",
    ". then , there should be an interesting problem : if the fourth generation quarks exist , how to choose the order do the magnitude of the mixing angles concern the fourth generation quarks ? because there is not direct experimental measurement of the fourth generation quark mixing angles , one have to look for other indirect methods to solve the problem .",
    "many refs . have already talked about these additional ckm mixing angles@xcite , like the vector - like quark models@xcite , the four neutrinos models@xcite and the sequential four generations models@xcite . for simple ,",
    "we give a guess for the magnitude of the fourth generation mixing angles .",
    "similar to the general ckm matrix elements magnitude order , the fourth generation ones are about @xmath52 order between the @xmath41 and @xmath53 generation , such as @xmath54 , as well as @xmath55 between the @xmath42 and @xmath53 generation , such as @xmath56 . for the mixing between the @xmath46 and @xmath53 generation quarks , such as @xmath57 , we take the magnitude as 1 because the mass of the fourth generation quark @xmath9 is the same order , @xmath58 , as the top quark @xmath59 .",
    "so @xmath57 should take the order of @xmath40 .",
    "then , the magnitude order of the fourth generation ckm factor @xmath26 is about @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath60 . from figs .",
    "3 , we found that the numerical results , @xmath61 , satisfy this guess . at last",
    ", the factor @xmath26 constrained from @xmath14 does not contradict to the ckm matrix texture .",
    "moreover , it seem to support the existence of the fourth generation .",
    "in summary , we study the constraints of some 4th generation quark mixing matrix from rare @xmath62 decays . we find they satisfy the unitarity conditions of the ckm matrix .",
    "we also talk about the texture of the fourth generation ckm matrix .",
    "all these constriants could provide a possible signal of new physics .",
