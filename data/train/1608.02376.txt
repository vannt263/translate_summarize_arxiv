    "intermetallic compounds attract tremendous interest as a playground for novel electronic phases , such as unconventional superconductivity , partial forms of the electronic and spin order , emergent behaviour such as magnetic monopoles in the spin ices and frustration in spin liquids .",
    "in general , the preparation of high - quality single crystals of the materials of interest is extremely demanding , since a large number of mechanisms lead to the formation of intrinsic point defects .",
    "examples include the formation due to configuration entropy , kinetically inhibited atomic motion during solidification and frozen - in disorder .",
    "the different species of defects comprise of , e.g. , point defects such as vacancies and antisite disorder , dislocations or vacancy clusters . despite their great relevance ,",
    "the qualitative and quantitative identification of point defects has been very challenging technically .",
    "for instance , scanning tunneling microscopy is a surface sensitive probe only , whereas transmission electron microscopy introduces ambiguities , as the sample has to be machined thinned and prepared mechanically .",
    "further , the degree of long - range order is conventionally accessible by diffraction techniques .",
    "yet , point defect concentrations can not be resolved below 10@xmath4 .    in this paper , we demonstrate how to obtain microscopic insights on the existence , nature and quantity of defects in intermetallic compounds .",
    "we combine various positron - based techniques and ab - initio calculations of point defect thermodynamics for the identification of the defect species and the quantitative determination of the defect density .",
    "this allows us to elucidate their influence on the magnetic and transport properties in the itinerant - electron magnet mnsi .    for our study",
    "we have selected mnsi as an important show - case of several aspects of new forms of electronic order .",
    "notably , mnsi and related compounds in recent years have attracted great interest due to the formation of a regular arrangement of spin whirls forming a so - called skyrmion lattice at finite magnetic fields in a small phase pocket just below @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial topological winding of these whirls gives rise to an emergent electrodynamics , in which each skyrmion carries one quantum of emergent magnetic flux  @xcite .",
    "the emergent electrodynamics is at the heart of exceptionally strong spin transfer torques overcoming defect related pinning .",
    "this has generated great interest to exploit skyrmions in spintronics devices .",
    "another important facet of the magnetic properties of mnsi is the paramagnetic to helimagnetic transition , which represents the first unambiguous example of a fluctuation - induced first order transition as long predicted by brazovskii in the context of soft matter . as for the skyrmion lattice phase",
    "the effects of tiny defect concentrations appear to be of central importance .",
    "last but not least , high pressure studies in mnsi have revealed an extended non - fermi liquid regime , where both the exponent and prefactor of the resistivity are essentially independent of the residual resistivity  @xcite .",
    "these various aspects of the importance of defects are underscored by the metallurgical properties of mnsi , which appear to be particularly amenable to the preparation of large , virtually perfect single crystals . in turn , mnsi represents a show - case par excellence in which the influence of low defect concentrations on novel electronic properties may be studied .",
    "mnsi belongs to the cubic b20 compounds with the space group @xmath6 lacking inversion symmetry .",
    "mnsi melts congruently at @xmath7 and large single crystals may be readily grown from the melt using methods such as czochralsky , bridgman , and inductively or optically heated float - zoning  @xcite .",
    "the resulting samples readily show residual resistivity ratios ( rrr ) between 50 and 100 , where carefully annealed specimens reach values as high as 1000  @xcite . at ambient pressure , however , small deviations of the transition temperatures and the shapes of the corresponding thermodynamic signatures were reported for samples with different rrr  @xcite .",
    "the latter also seems to influence the possibility to metastably extend the skyrmion lattice pocket at large hydrostatic pressures under field - cooling  @xcite .",
    "however , neither the density nor the type of lattice defects in single - crystal mnsi has been addressed before .",
    "knowledge of the defect structure in turn is key to understanding phenomena such as the very weak energy scales controlling the brazovskii transition , the depinning of the skyrmion lattice under electrical currents  @xcite , the dynamics of the topological unwinding of skyrmions  @xcite , or the emergence of non - fermi liquid behavior at high pressures  @xcite .    given the importance of any of these topics , we decided to study the point defects in mnsi in a series of optically float - zoned single crystals by means of positron annihilation spectroscopy . in combination with calculations of the effective formation energies of point defects",
    "this allows us to determine the species and density of defects quantitatively .",
    "measurements of the specific heat and the ac susceptibility demonstrate that the rrr is not sufficient to characterize a sample of mnsi , as specimens with the same rrr but different dominant defect species show discrepancies in the thermodynamic signatures of the magnetic phase transitions .",
    "for our study ten single crystals of mnsi were grown by means of optical float - zoning  @xcite .",
    "we investigated the influence of two growth parameters , namely the growth rate , @xmath8 , and the composition of the feed rods represented by the mn excess , @xmath9 , of the initial net weight of mn@xmath10si , @xmath11 .",
    "we induced this mn excess in order to compensate evaporative losses of mn caused by its high vapor pressure during crystal preparation .",
    "the cylinders of the single crystals ( see fig .  [ figure1](a ) ) were investigated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy ( pals ) and the end discs by coincident doppler broadening spectroscopy ( cdbs ) .",
    "prompt gamma activation analysis ( pgaa )  @xcite results were consistent with a stoichiometric composition within the estimated error of 1.5at.% .",
    "for all specimens we expect the same total density of impurity atoms originating from the starting elements below @xmath12 .     for different growth rates @xmath8 .",
    "samples from the same disc exhibit very similar rrrs .",
    "dashed lines are guides to the eye . here and in the following figures , data acquired on discs from start , end , and",
    "the cylinders are represented respectively.[figure1],scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the rrr of all samples studied is shown in fig .  [",
    "figure1](b ) . additionally , the values for all crystals are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : values ] together with the other important measured parameters introduced later .",
    "the start ( blue ) and end ( red ) of the single crystals exhibit qualitatively similar behavior , where both low and high values of @xmath9 lead to low rrrs around 40 .",
    "a maximum in the rrr , expected for a minimal total defect concentration , is obtained for a slight initial mn excess as consistent with a compensation of the observed evaporation of mn during crystal growth .",
    "the small systematic variations between the start and the end of the crystals may be attributed to the different temperature history during growth where the start stayed at elevated temperatures for a longer period of time leading to larger losses of mn . in the parameter range studied , the growth rate had no significant influence on the rrr .",

    "their calculated values , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) , show that mnsi belongs to the class of compounds with antisite accommodation of deviations from stoichiometry ( with the defect energetics described by the two dimensionless parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 )  @xcite . specifically , also on the si - rich side deviations from stoichiometry",
    "are accommodated as antisites .",
    "still , as in this situation the thermal formation of v@xmath58 is very inexpensive , a copious equilibrium concentration of v@xmath59 is expected at the elevated temperatures during growth as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) .",
    "diffusion measurements on mnsi have not been reported yet , but data on the isostructural fesi suggest that diffusion in b20 compounds is extremely slow  @xcite . hence , large thermal vacancy concentrations will be frozen in during cooling already at high temperatures .",
    "the results of the positron annihilation experiments in combination with the calculated formation energies of point defects allow us to interpret the rrr shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) . for starting compositions of @xmath60 ,",
    "si antisites ( si@xmath59 ) and frozen - in thermal vacancies on the mn sublattice ( v@xmath20 ) are the dominant defect types leading to a low rrr .",
    "around @xmath61 , at the maximum of the rrr , a pronounced drop of @xmath21 is detected which indicates a transition from mn - deficient to stoichiometric crystals with a minimal total concentration of defects .",
    "the shift with respect to @xmath62 is attributed to the evaporation of mn during growth . for @xmath63 , @xmath21 further decreases as observed by cdbs and pals .",

    "[ figure4](e ) , all samples investigated show a plateau of reduced susceptibility just below @xmath5 in an applied field of 0.2 t .",

    "bearing in mind the very large magnetic correlation length of @xmath74 in bulk mnsi , defect - related pinning of magnetic textures is expected mainly in form of ( weak ) collective pinning  @xcite .",
    "we have combined measurements of the magnetic bulk properties , rrr , positron annihilation spectroscopy , and calculations of effective defect formation energies in order to identify the species of point defects and their influence on magnetic and transport properties in a series of single crystals of mnsi . using this approach we gained a detailed picture of characteristic lattice defects . beside antisites on both sublattices , vacancies on the mn sublattice are immanent in the system , where the dominant type of defects can be tuned by the initial mn content .",
