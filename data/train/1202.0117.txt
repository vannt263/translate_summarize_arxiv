    "dengue , a vector - borne infectious disease caused by the dengue virus ( denv ) , is one of the gravest and most difficult to understand diseases infecting humans . the biological mechanisms and dynamical processes involved during this infection therefore demand a serious study , which is especially relevant from the point of view of a complex non - linear biological model with varied and rich dynamics . dengue is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _ aedes aegypti _ and _ a. albopictus _ mosquitoes . according to who estimates ,",
    "50 to 100 million infections occur each year leading to 500,000 hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths(http://www.who.int / mediacentre / factsheets / fs117/en ) . until recently dengue was considered to be a disease of the tropics , but now it has spread its domain of infection to temperate regions as well , primarily boosted by global warming(http://www.sciencedaily.com / releases/1998/03/980310081157.html ) .",
    "it is understood that four closely related serotypes of denv exist viz .",
    "denv-1 , denv-2 , denv-3 and denv-4 @xcite and these four serotypes cause infections of varying severity in humans .",
    "the infected individual usually suffers from acute febrile illness called dengue fever ( df ) which is cleared by a complex immune response in a short time of approximately 7 days after onset of fever .",
    "there are more severe manifestations of this disease like dengue hemorrhagic fever ( dhf ) and dengue shock syndrome ( dss ) . often without immediate and necessary proper treatment dhf / dss",
    "can be fatal @xcite .",
    "we note that there is no specific drug or vaccine yet developed to prevent its infection .",
    "the epidemiology of dengue in varied populations have been studied previously using improved or extended versions of the basic sir model @xcite . here",
    "we present a mathematical model on a cellular scale incorporating time delay in immune response which is very relevant and important in this context .",
    "a few such models describing the cell - virus interaction dynamics have been studied in other contexts like hiv or hepatitis @xcite . however , micro - epidemiological studies reported in the context of denv are very few , one such study reported recently involves t - cell immune response . @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose a within - host dynamical model that involves humoral or antibody - antigen immune response which is known to be more important for dengue virus - host interactions .",
    "we also introduce intra cellular time delays that come from the various steps involved during antibody production @xcite .",
    "our study indicates how the antibodies and their interactions play a decisive role in the dynamics .",
    "we carry out a detailed stability analysis followed by numerical analysis to identify the relevant range of parameters that correspond best with the observed facts .",
    "we find that there exists a critical value for the immune response parameter above which the disease free state is always stable",
    ". however large time delay in antibody production can upset this and lead to oscillatory nature of the virus counts .",
    "we extend the primary infection model to a 6-dimensional secondary infection model with heterologous and homologous antibodies .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , it is the first attempt at modelling the secondary dengue infection on a micro - epidemic scale , with novel features like time delays , correlation factor between the viral serotypes and a dynamic switch .",
    "the correlation factor is introduced to bring in the relatedness in the different denv serotypes into the dynamics , which is very important in the context of secondary infection . the dynamical switch in our model toggles between different values based on the antibody concentrations present from the primary infection .",
    "with these additional parameters , our model can account for antibody dependent enhancement of virus as well as the increased antibody counts observed clinically during secondary dengue infection .",
    "further modifications of the models by including effects of vaccination may help in realising precautionary mechanisms to combat dengue , which will be a major breakthrough since no effective vaccine exists as of now against dengue .    before proceeding further ,",
    "it is imperative to consider what denv does once introduced into the human body by an infected mosquito . after the entry of virions into the body , it is understood that the virions infect macrophages , monocytes , dendritic cells , mast cells and hepatocytes@xcite .",
    "once inside the target cells , these virions start multiplying in the infected cells and burst out of them in large numbers , thus aggravating the infection .",
    "virions incite a counter - reaction in the form of an immune response to curb this infection . there exist different complex mechanisms which form the immune response , out of which the humoral immune response is of utmost relevance as far as dengue is concerned @xcite .",
    "on coming in contact with the antigens present on the virus particles , the b - cells of the body start the process of producing antibodies which are proteins made to complement the antigens and which then neutralise the virus particles , making them non - infectious .",
    "these virus - antibody aggregates are then chemically degraded and destroyed in the macrophages ( note that macrophages are also denv targets ) .",
    "the external manifestations of this whole process is what we generally see as an acute febrile illness that gets cured within 7 - 14 days even in the absence of medication .",
    "if a person is introduced to denv of any serotype for the first time , it is termed as primary infection .",
    "it is observed that infection with a serotype provides life - long immunity against that serotype , i.e. recurrence of dengue infection with the same serotype is not observed .",
    "this is because the memoryof the previous infection suppresses the spread of virions without much delay .",
    "if an individual who has already undergone primary infection is again exposed to denv of a different serotype then it is called secondary infection .",
    "it is generally observed that complicated and fatal conditions of dss / dhf occur in patients suffering from secondary infection .",
    "what makes primary infection easy for the body to deal with and secondary infection so severe ? to answer this question",
    "we must look at what happens when a different denv serotype enters the body that is already prepared to tackle previous denv serotype .",
    "the new denv serotype is structurally similar to the old one , hence it leads to production of antibodies that complement the old serotype ( i.e. cross immunity ) along with new antibodies that are made to combat the new serotype .",
    "thus , there are mainly two relevant antibodies now , one from the old infection which are heterologous to the new serotype and the new homologous antibodies from the present infection .",
    "both these antibodies have the capacity to bind to virions and neutralise them .",
    "once neutralised the antibody - virus complex is taken to the macrophages .",
    "this time though , on entering the macrophage , the heterologous antibodies are released from the virus due to their low affinity for this new serotype .",
    "this makes a fraction of the virus particles bare and ready for infecting the macrophage .",
    "thus the antibodies produced against the new serotype protects as well as carries the virus to their targets depending on the affinity between the antigen and antibody .",
    "this process is termed as the antibody dependent enhancement ( ade ) of infection .",
    "clinically it is observed that during the secondary infection the viral counts are higher than that of the primary infection but the virus clears from the body in about the same time .",
    "the striking feature of secondary infections is a very high concentration of antibodies in the bodies of patients .",
    "in fact , it is this high load of antibodies which further leads to severe conditions described by dss / dhf .",
    "therefore , it is the nature of the immune response that plays a critical role in the study of dengue @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the mathematical models describing primary and secondary dengue infections based on the intracellular mechanisms described above and analyse them mathematically and computationally .",
    "the paper proceeds by describing the primary model in section  [ sec:1 ] , its analytical treatment in section  [ sec:2 ] , secondary infection model in section  [ sec:4 ] , its numerical analysis in section  [ sec:5 ] and conclusions in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "we present the mathematical model describing the primary infection as a 5-d model that takes into consideration the viral dynamics and humoral immune response as described in the introduction .",
    "it is built on the basic 3-d model i.e. healthy cells , infected cells and virus particles proposed by may and nowak @xcite .",
    "the pictorial representation of the b - cell dependent humoral response is given in figure (  [ fig : fig1]a ) and a schematic representation of the model described below is shown in figure (  [ fig : fig1]b )    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we also identify regions of stability for the secondary infection using numerical simulations and show the region of stability as a function of _ f _ and _ k _ similar to that of primary infection . as the value of _",
    "w _ increases the region of instability for non zero virus count becomes narrower as shown in the figures (  [ fig : fig13 ] ) .",
    "this implies that even though the severity of the infection might increase with _ w _ ( because of enhanced antibody production ) the instability region in fact decreases .",
    "also , in the situations when the system was in the unstable region of primary infection , the outcome of the secondary infection is independent of the initial value of heterologous antibody .",
    "dengue forms a major concern in the contemporary world scenario due to its severity and complexity .",
    "considered to be a tropical disease , it is spreading to higher latitudes due to changes in climatic and human activities .",
    "hence , it is of great importance to study the epidemiology of dengue infections on a global macro - epidemic scale .",
    "here we emphasise on the relevance of studying it on a micro - epidemic level to know the mechanism involved in the infection which will certainly help to eradicate it . in this paper",
    "we analyse the dynamics involved in primary infection and introduce a mathematical model describing the secondary dengue infections in accordance with the humoral immune response of the host against denv attack .",
    "our results show that the host immune mechanism is capable of limiting the virus growth in the early stages .",
    "the virus goes down to undetectable levels within 7 - 14 days as found in clinical literature .",
    "the results also imply that , in general , human body can be supposed to have a value of immune response stimulating parameter ( _ f _ ) higher than the critical value @xmath0 , since , once infected , the body can easily cope with a secondary infection of the same serotype and settle to the stable region of disease free equilibrium ( i.e. @xmath1 )",
    ". the results related with the dependence of stability on time delay @xmath2 are definitely interesting from an analytical point of view but it is equally interesting to see that they have any biological repercussions .",
    "moreover , our results agree well with the observational studies of secondary infections such as a stronger immune response and a higher viral load that clears early in the infection.we have also confirmed the mechanism of ade leading to higher viral loads .",
    "it will be interesting to experimentally verify the results related to correlation between different serotypes and their impact on the body s inflammatory response by antibody count measurements . in conclusion",
    "we note that this is the first attempt to model primary dengue infection along with the secondary infection on a micro - epidemic level using humoral immune response .",
    "we have considered delay in immune response and introduced a correlation factor and dynamic switch in the secondary infection model .",
    "the results obtained so forth are very encouraging to further extend this work for the mathematical analysis of the secondary infection model and tune it to the fine details of the unusual virus - host interactions observed in dengue infections with biological data .",
    "further work in this direction will surely help in understanding the complex mechanisms involved in dengue pathogenesis .",
    "it will also be helpful to formulate relevant schemes to develop a dengue vaccine which can provide immunity against all four serotypes in future .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
