    "the term ` stochastic resonance ' was introduced in the early  80s ( see @xcite and @xcite ) in the study of periodic advance of glaciers on earth .",
    "the stochastic resonance is the effect of nonmonotone dependence of the response of a system on the noise when this noise ( for instance the temperature ) is added to a periodic input signal ( see e.g. @xcite , in which the author explains also differences and similarities with the notion of stochastic filtering ) .",
    "an extensive review on stochastic resonance and its presence in different fields of applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , as stochastic resonance we intend the phenomenon in which the transmission of a signal can be improved ( in terms of statistical quantities ) by the addition of noise . from the statistical point of view",
    "the problem is to estimate a signal @xmath0 transmitted through a channel .",
    "this signal has to be detected by a receiver that can reveal signals louder than a threshold @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath2 is bounded from above by @xmath1 , the signal is not observable and the problem has not a solution .",
    "but , if some noise @xmath3 is added to the signal , the perturbed signal @xmath4 may be observable and inference can be done on @xmath2 .",
    "too few noise is not sufficient to give good estimates and too much noise deteriorates excessively the signal .",
    "the optimal  in some sense  level of the noise will be called stochastic resonance in this framework .",
    "usually ( see @xcite ) the criterion applied to measure optimality of estimators are the shannon mutual information or the kullback divergence .",
    "more recently the fisher information quantity have been also proposed ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "here we are concerned with the fisher information quantity .",
    "it happens that this quantity , as a function of the noise , can be maximized for certain noise structures . if there is only one global maximum , the corresponding noise level is the value for which we have stochastic resonance , if several local maxima are present , the phenomenon is called stochastic multi - resonance .    in this paper",
    "we study the problem of estimation and hypotheses testing for the following model : we suppose to have a threshold @xmath5 and a subthreshold constant and non negative signal @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "we add , in continuous time , a noise that is a trajectory of a diffusion process @xmath8 and we observe the perturbed signal @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the level of the noise .",
    "we propose two schemes of observations : _",
    "i ) _ we observe only the proportion of time spent by the perturbed signal over the threshold @xmath1 and _ ii ) _ we measure the energy of the perturbed signal when it is above the threshold .",
    "the asymptotic is considered as time goes to infinity .",
    "this approach differs from the ones in the current statistical literature basically for two reasons : the noise structure is an ergodic diffusion process and not a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables and data are collected in continuous time .",
    "this second aspect is a substantial difference but it is not a problem from the point of view of applications for the two schemes of observations proposed if one thinks at analogical devices .",
    "we propose two different estimators for the schemes and we study their asymptotic properties .",
    "we present an example where , in both cases , it emerges the phenomenon of stochastic resonance . for the same model we also solve the problem of testing the simple hypothesis @xmath11 against the simple alternative @xmath12 by applying the bayesian maximum a posterior probability criterion .",
    "it emerges that the overall probability of error is nonmonotonically dependent on @xmath13 .",
    "we show again that there exists a non trivial local minimum of this probability that is again the effect of stochastic resonance .",
    "the presence of stochastic resonance in this context is noted for the first time here .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we set up the regularity assumptions of the model . in sections",
    "[ sec : time ] and [ sec : energy ] we prove some asymptotic properties estimators for the two schemes and we calculate numerically the points where the fisher information quantity attains its maximum for both models .",
    "it turns out that the estimators proposed are asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimators .",
    "section [ sec : test ] is devoted to the problem of hypotheses testing .",
    "all the figures are collected at the end of the paper .",
    "let @xmath1 be the threshold and @xmath6 a constant signal . taking @xmath14 will not influence the calculations that follows but",
    "may improve the exposition , so we use this assumption .",
    "let @xmath15 be a given diffusion process solution to the following stochastic differential equation @xmath16 with non random initial value @xmath17 .",
    "the process @xmath15 is supposed to have the ergodic property with invariant measure @xmath18 and invariant distribution function @xmath19)$ ] as @xmath20 .",
    "the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy the global lipschitz condition @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lipschitz constant . under condition [ cond : c1 ]",
    ", equation has a unique strong solution ( see e.g. @xcite ) but any equivalent condition to [ cond : c1 ] can be assumed because we do not use explicitly it in the sequel .",
    "the following conditions are needed to ensure the ergodicity of the process @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath26 then there exists the stationary distribution function @xmath27 and it takes the following form @xmath28 again , any other couple of conditions that imply the existence of @xmath27 can be used instead of [ cond : c3 ] and [ cond : c3 ] .",
    "we perturb the signal @xmath6 by adding , proportionally to some level @xmath10 , the trajectory diffusion process @xmath15 into the channel",
    ". the result will be the perturbed signal @xmath29 .",
    "this new signal will be detectable only when it is above the threshold @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 is still ergodic with trend and diffusion coefficients respectively @xmath31 and @xmath32 and initial value @xmath33 , but we will not use directly this process . we denote by @xmath34 the observable part of the trajectory of @xmath30 , being @xmath35 the indicator function of the set @xmath36 .",
    "we consider two possibile schemes of observation :    * we observe only the proportion of time spent by @xmath30 over the threshold @xmath1 @xmath37 * we measure the energy of the signal @xmath38",
    "@xmath39    in the next sections , for the two models we establish asymptotic properties of estimators given by the generalized method of moments . in @xcite different properties of the generalized method of moments for ergodic diffusion processes are studied . in this note",
    "we follows the lines given in the paper of@xcite for the i.i.d . setting .",
    "these results are interesting in themselves independently from the problem of stochastic resonance .",
    "we give an example of stochastic resonance based on the process where the phenomenon of stochastic resonance appears pronounced and in which results in a closed form can be written down .",
    "the random variable @xmath40 can be rewritten in terms of the process @xmath15 as @xmath41 by the ergodic property of @xmath15 we have that @xmath42 where @xmath43 has @xmath27 as distribution function . from it",
    "derives that @xmath44 so that @xmath6 is a one - to - one continuous function of @xmath45 . from the glivenko - cantelli theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) for the empirical distribution function ( edf ) defined by @xmath46 follows directly that @xmath40 is a @xmath47-consistent estimator of @xmath45 thus also @xmath48 is a @xmath49-consistent estimator for @xmath6 .",
    "we can calculate the asymptotic variance of this estimator .",
    "it is known that ( see @xcite and @xcite ) the edf is asymptotically gaussian and in particular @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the inverse of the analogue of the fisher information quantity in the problem of distribution function estimation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the quantity @xmath55 is also the minimax asymptotic lower bound for the quadratic risk associated to the estimation of @xmath56 , so that @xmath57 is asymptotically efficient in this sense .",
    "the asymptotic variance @xmath58 of @xmath59 can be derived by means of the so - called @xmath60-method ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath61 thus @xmath62 where @xmath2 is the density of @xmath27 .",
    "the quantity @xmath58 can also be derived from the asymptotic minimal variance @xmath63 of the edf estimator .",
    "in fact , with little abuse of notation , by putting @xmath64 and @xmath65 we have that @xmath66      we now show that @xmath40 also maximizes the approximate likelihood of the model .",
    "in fact , for the central limit theorem for the edf we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a standard gaussian random variable .",
    "thus @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the distribution function of @xmath68 .",
    "we approximate the likelihood function of @xmath40 by @xmath71 that is maximal when @xmath72 thus , the maximum likelihood estimator of @xmath6 ( constructed on the approximated likelihood ) reads @xmath73 so if the approximation above is acceptable , one can infer the optimality property of @xmath40 of having minimum variance from being also the maximum likelihood estimator .      to view the effect of stochastic resonance on the fisher information we consider a particular example . by setting @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath75 the noise become a standard process solution to the stochastic differential equation @xmath76 in such a case , the ergodic distribution function @xmath27 is the gaussian law with zero mean and variance 1/2 .",
    "the asymptotic variance @xmath58 assumes the following form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the classical error function .",
    "in figure [ fig1 ] it is shown that for this model there exists the phenomenon of stochastic resonance . for a fixed level of noise @xmath13 the fisher information increases as the signal @xmath6 is closer to the threshold @xmath1 .",
    "for a fixed value of the signal @xmath6 , the fisher information , as a function of @xmath13 , has a single maximum , that is the optimal level of noise .",
    "for example , if @xmath79 then the optimal level is @xmath80 and for @xmath81 it is @xmath82 .",
    "suppose that it is possibile to observe not only the time when the perturbed process is over the threshold but also its trajectory above @xmath1 , say @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "we now show how it is possibile to estimate the unknown signal @xmath6 from the equivalent of the energy of the signal for @xmath85 : literally from the quantity @xmath86 we use the following general result from @xcite on the estimation of functionals of the invariant distribution functions for ergodic diffusion processes . _",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 be such that @xmath89 .",
    "then @xmath90 is a @xmath49-consistent estimator for @xmath91 where @xmath43 is distributed according to @xmath27_. in our case @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the estimator @xmath94 can be rewritten as @xmath95 and it converges to the quantity @xmath96 that is a continuous and increasing function of @xmath6 , @xmath97 .",
    "its inverse @xmath98 allows us to have again @xmath99 . by applying the @xmath60-method once again",
    ", we can obtain the asymptotic variance of @xmath100 from the asymptotic variance of @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath101 where @xmath102 the asymptotic variance of @xmath94 is given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath103 where @xmath104 and its inverse is also the minimal asymptotic variance in the problem of estimation of functionals for ergodic diffusion .",
    "thus , the asymptotic variance of @xmath100 is given by @xmath105    * remark : * _ by the asymptotic normality of @xmath94 follows that @xmath100 is also the value that maximizes the approximate likelihood function .",
    "in fact , as in the previous example , if we approximate the density function of @xmath94 with @xmath106 it is clear that @xmath100 is its maximum . _      as before , we put in evidence the phenomenon of stochastic resonance by using the process as noise .",
    "the quantities involved ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) transform into the following @xmath109 ( from which it appears that @xmath107 is an increasing function of @xmath6 ) and @xmath110 in figure [ fig1 ] it is plotted the fisher information of the model as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath13 .",
    "also in this case there is evidence of stochastic resonance . for a fixed value of @xmath6",
    "is then possibile to find the optimal noise level @xmath13 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath111 then we have stochastic resonance at @xmath112 and for @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "we now study a problem of testing two simple hypotheses for the model discussed in the previous section . as in @xcite , we apply the maximum _ a posteriori _ probability ( map ) criterion .",
    "we will see that the decision rules for our model are similar to the one proposed by chapeau - blondeau in the i.i.d . setting .",
    "given the observation @xmath40 we want to verify the null hypothesis that the unknown constant signal is @xmath115 against the simple alternative @xmath116 , with @xmath117 : @xmath118 suppose that , before observing @xmath40 , we have a _",
    "prior _ information on the parameter , that is @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the map criterion uses the following likelihood ratio @xmath121 and the decision rule is to accept @xmath122 whenever @xmath123 ( decision @xmath124 ) or refuse it otherwise ( decision @xmath125 ) .",
    "the overall probability of error is @xmath126 let now be @xmath127 then , the likelihood @xmath128 appears as @xmath129 to write explicitly the decision rule and then study the effect of stochastic resonance we have to distinguish three cases : @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .    1 .",
    "let it be @xmath130 , then put @xmath133 then , if @xmath134 accept @xmath122 and @xmath135 .",

    "the variance @xmath145 , for a fixed threshold @xmath1 and noise level @xmath13 , is a non decreasing function of @xmath6 being @xmath146 only a scale factor ( figure [ fig2 ] gives a numerical representation of this statement ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath147 is , in general , given by formula .",

    "the @xmath147 shows the effect of stochastic resonance .",
    "so it appears that in some cases the noise level @xmath13 can reduce sensibly the overall probability of making the wrong decision .",
