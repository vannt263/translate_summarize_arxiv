    "anderson models are random schrdinger operators given by the sum of a kinetic operator and a random potential . in a discrete setting the kinetic part",

    "let me give some overview of the proofs .",
    "the operators considered in theorem  [ th : main ] have a special structure which allows an analysis through @xmath221 transfer matrices .",
    "we say that such operators have one propagating channel , for a precise definition see section  [ sub : spectrum ] .",
    "in fact , one of the novelties in this work is the realization that many techniques from one - dimensional theory such as subordinacy theory by gilbert - pearson and kahn - pearson @xcite and links between transfer matrices and spectrum as developed by kiselev , last and simon @xcite can be translated to operators with one propagating channel .",
    "the precise theorems are listed in section  [ sub : spectrum ] and details are carefully carried out in appendix  [ app : spectrum ] which shows the modifications that have to be made compared to the jacobi operator case .",
    "for instance , not for all real energies all the transfer matrices will be defined .",
    "the set of energies where some transfer matrix is not defined will be denoted by @xmath222 and in order to make a direct translation of the subordinacy theory , one needs to stay away from the closure of @xmath222 .",
    "moreover , some new technical estimates are needed which are completely trivial in the jacobi case ( cf .",
    "lemma  [ lem - sub - keyest ] and the proof in section  [ sec : key - estimate - sub ] ) .",
    "the kinetic part of @xmath100 effectively averages the potentials in the @xmath22-th shell within the energy regions @xmath102 which is expressed in terms of a harmonic mean of random variables in the transfer matrices ( cf . ) .",
    "then one needs some estimates as done in section  [ sec : keyestimate ] and the spectral analysis tools translated from the one - dimensional theory , to see that one can treat the problem analogue to random decaying potentials in one dimension as done in @xcite .",
    "one important step is to show that it is in principle sufficient to consider the spectral measure at the roots @xmath34 , cf .",
    "theorem  [ th : sigma_0 ] . here",
    ", this is not completely trivial because unlike in the pure one dimensional case @xmath223 ( @xmath224 for all @xmath22 ) , the localized states at the roots are not necessarily cyclic for @xmath100 , cf .",
    "remark  [ rem : purepoint ]  ( ii ) . starting from identities between the green s functions and formal solutions of the eigenvalue equation ( cf .",
    "lemma  [ lem : gr ] ) one can still show that for the energies where all transfer matrices are defined it is sufficient to consider the measure at a special vector supported on @xmath34 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . section  [ sub : spectrum ] lists all adapted theorems from the theory of one - dimensional jacobi operators to the more general setup of operators with one propagating channel , they are deterministic ( no randomness enters ) and may be interesting on their own .",
    "the translation of subordinacy theory requires some new estimates ( lemma  [ lem - sub - keyest ] ) proved in section  [ sec : key - estimate - sub ] .",
    "details of the adaption of these theorems are carefully carried out in appendix  [ app : spectrum ] .    in section  [ sec : spec - h ]",
    "we prove proposition  [ prop - spec - h ] based on proposition  [ prop - spec_ess ] also proved there .",
    "section  [ sec : keyestimate ] summarizes some facts on harmonic means of random variables and in section  [ sec : pruefer ] we conclude proving theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "there we combine some of the theorems of section  [ sub : spectrum ] and techniques as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  8) , particularly theorem  [ th - lim - log(t ) ] where some more details are given in appendix  [ app - estimate ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : pdp ] we prove corollary  [ coro : main ] .      in the set",
    "@xmath225 $ ] the random variables @xmath226 do not have a distinct sign .",
    "the entries in the transfer matrices ( cf . , ) will be harmonic means of such random variables ( cf . ) .",
    "depending on the energy and the distribution of @xmath101 , these harmonic means may not have an expectation and also @xmath113 does not need to exist .",
    "therefore , the transfer matrices have a lot of randomness and one might expect localization in this region . on the other hand , as @xmath227 the set @xmath222 ( cf . ) where not all transfer matrices are defined is dense in the interior of @xmath228 .",
    "this sort of also reflects the fact that we have an eigenvalue at @xmath90 with infinite multiplicity for @xmath229 . for positive @xmath117 these states may start to resonate and one could imagine the formation of some delocalized states .",
    "however , similar as in a recent paper by aizenman , shamis and warzel on resonances and partly delocalized states on the complete graph @xcite , these states may only delocalize in the @xmath230 but not @xmath231 sense meaning that one could have eigenvectors not lying in @xmath232",
    ". a deeper analysis of these resonances might be very interesting .",
    "the spectral type may also depend on the distribution @xmath101 or be random , particularly in the region @xmath233 .    even though the set @xmath102 may not be empty even for large @xmath117 and so one may have some a.c .",
    "spectrum if @xmath130 , there still should be some sort of large disorder localization :    for any compact interval @xmath234 $ ] and any sequence @xmath235 , there is a @xmath236 such that for @xmath237 the spectrum of the anderson model @xmath100 on @xmath77 is almost surely pure point in @xmath234 $ ] .",
    "this conjecture is intertwined with the comment above as for any compact set and large enough @xmath117 one has @xmath234\\subset { { \\mathcal i}}_\\lambda$ ] .",
    "this conjecture is trivially true if @xmath238 because of a gap in the spectrum for large @xmath117 . in terms of the above theorems one",
    "may also conjecture the following :    if @xmath239 , then the spectrum of @xmath155 is almost surely singular at any disorder .",
    "now let us examine the structure of the operator @xmath240 in more detail .",
    "we will use the equivalence @xmath241 and can therefore write @xmath242 where @xmath243 .",
    "the transpose shall emphasize that we will consider @xmath244 as a column vector and the pairs @xmath245 , @xmath246 denote the vertices in @xmath77 .",
    "define @xmath247 by @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the normalized @xmath86 vector with entry one at @xmath245 and entry zero on all other vertices and @xmath250 denotes the scalar product . then , as each vertex in @xmath33 is only connected to vertices in @xmath251 , we find @xmath252 .",
    "note that @xmath253 and the term @xmath254 has to be understood as a matrix product of a colum vector with a row vector .",
    "therefore , the anderson model can be written as @xmath255 where @xmath256 and the @xmath257 are real , independent identically distributed random variables with distribution @xmath101 .",
    "note , as the @xmath258 are vectors , the expression @xmath259 is the standard scalar product between @xmath258 and @xmath244 in @xmath260 .",
    "when necessary we will consider the @xmath257 as random variables on an abstract probability space @xmath261 .",
    "expectations with respect to @xmath262 will be denoted by @xmath72 , so @xmath263 . at @xmath90",
    "we have dirichlet boundary conditions , i.e. formally @xmath264 and @xmath265 is any number .",
    "we will use some generalizations of well - known one - dimensional transfer matrix techniques and list the corresponding theorems here . for the proofs one",
    "has to go through the one - dimensional theory and adapt the proofs and results step by step .",
    "as the situation here is different from the pure one - dimensional case we give the details in appendix  [ app : spectrum ] .    because of the more general nature of these theorems we drop the coupling constant @xmath117 and let @xmath266 be general hermitian matrices and @xmath267 be any sequence of * non - zero * vectors such that the operator @xmath268 acting on @xmath269 is uniquely",
