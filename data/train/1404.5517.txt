    "in 2004 , the discovery of an one atom thick material was announced , which rapidly caught the attention of many physicists @xcite .",
    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice , is considered a truly two dimensional system .",
    "the carriers within it behave as two - dimensional massless dirac fermions @xcite .",
    "due to its peculiar physical properties , graphene has great potential for nanoelectronic applications @xcite .",
    "graphene can be considered a zero - gap semiconductor .",
    "this fact prevents the pinch off of charge currents in electronic devices .",
    "quantum confinement of electrons and holes in nanoribbons @xcite and quantum dots @xcite can be realized in order to induce a gap .",
    "however , this lattice disorder suppresses an efficient charge transport @xcite .",
    "one alternative to open a gap is to induce a strain field in a graphene sheet onto appropriate substrates @xcite .",
    "they play the role of an effective gauge field which yields a pseudo - magnetic field @xcite . unlike actual magnetic fields , these strain induced pseudo - magnetic fields do not violate the time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "recently , some works devoted to the search for solutions of the dirac equation with position dependent magnetic fields were addressed vary , jp.cm , sec , p1 . however , they consider _ actual _ instead of _ pseudo - magnetic _ fields .",
    "no experiments have been reported yet and we believe it is because such field configurations are not easy to implement in the laboratory . in this paper , we investigate a graphene sheet in the presence of both a constant orthogonal magnetic and an orthogonal pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "we consider the pseudo - magnetic field falling as @xmath2 .",
    "this configuration is not known experimentally , but in considering it as induced by elastic deformations in graphene , we believe someone would be able to implement it in the laboratory . moreover , this is the simplest case where we can get analytical solutions . specifically , we investigate how such non constant pseudo - magnetic field modifies the relativistic landau levels .",
    "we will solve the squared dirac equation and show that among the possible choices for the wavefunction , the correct is the one that diverges at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "this is compatible with the fact that our differential equation diverges at the origin as well . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is discussed that this is the correct choice if singularity is taken into account .",
    "otherwise , we would get the wrong spectrum .",
    "this is also in agreement with other quantum problems where singularities have also appeared .",
    "this question about the correct behavior of wavefunctions whenever we have singularities has been investigated via the _ self adjoint extension approach _ over the last years @xcite .",
    "an important result is that the zero - energy , which exist in the known relativistic landau levels when just the constant orthogonal magnetic field is present , does not show up for a specific range of the parameter characterizing the varying pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "the consequence is that a hall plateau develops at the null _ filling _ factor ( dimensionless ratio between the number of charge carriers and the flux quanta ) .",
    "modifications in the _ relativistic cyclotron frequency _ are examined as well .",
    "in this section , we will investigate how a varying pseudo - magnetic field perpendicular to a graphene sheet is going to affect the relativistic landau levels .",
    "first , we must remember the reader that the low - energy excitations of graphene behave as massless dirac fermions , instead of massive electrons .",
    "these low - energy excitations are described by the @xmath3-dimensional dirac equation @xmath4where @xmath5 are the pauli matrices , @xmath6 is a two - component spinor field , the speed of light @xmath7 was replaced by the fermi velocity ( @xmath8 m/s ) and @xmath9 has been fixed equal to one .",
    "the electronic states around the zero energy are states belonging to distinct sublattices .",
    "this is the reason we have a two component wavefunction .",
    "two indexes to indicate these sublattices , similar to spin indexes ( up and down ) , must be used .",
    "the inequivalent cornes of the brillouin zone , which are called _ dirac points _ , are labeled as @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .    in this work",
    ", the varying pseudo - magnetic field is supposed to appear due to strains on a graphene sheet @xcite .",
    "the valleys @xmath10 and @xmath11 feel an effective field of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is due to a real magnetic field and @xmath14 is due to a pseudo - magnetic field .",
    "notice that a different sign has to be used for the gauge field due to strain at the valleys @xmath10 and @xmath11 since such fields do not break time reversal symmetry @xcite . considering the landau gauge",
    ", we have @xmath15 \\;,\\]]where @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "this way , the magnetic field is @xmath17 \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$ ] .",
    "the first term in this field , @xmath18 , corresponds to a constant magnetic field along the @xmath19 direction which is perpendicular to the graphene plane .",
    "going back to the problem , we consider the electronic states around the valley @xmath10 and the minimal coupling for electrons as @xmath20 .",
    "then , @xmath21 .",
    "\\label{cou}\\]]for the valley @xmath11 we make the change @xmath22 .",

    "the exponential term guarantees that @xmath58if the series @xmath50 reduces to a polynomial of degree @xmath59 .",
    "no further condition must be considered for the wavefunction .",
    "but we must be careful in choosing the right solution since our differential equation ( f ) has a singularity at @xmath60 . considering @xmath61 in eq .",

    "if we take @xmath65 , the wavefunction ( [ general ] ) might diverge at the origin because of the term @xmath66 .",
    "this said , we conclude that the solution compatible with the fact that our differential equation is singular at @xmath60 must be that with @xmath65 in eq .",

    ", we have @xmath80 . as we saw above",
    ", the wavefunctions diverge for @xmath81 and @xmath70 .",
    "this means that regular solutions exist for @xmath82 and irregular solutions exist for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .     since the quantum probability does not diverge in this interval.,height=226 ]",

    "( [ general ] ) , we would have found @xmath91 as @xmath92 .",
    "so , this corroborates with our statement above that the correct solution must be that which may show divergence in the wavefunction at the origin .     versus @xmath93 .",

    "this expression shows that plateaus of conductivity are formed when @xmath107 .",
    "the filling factors @xmath108 correspond to the @xmath95 mode ( zero energy ) .",
    "when we turn on the varying magnetic field , the zero landau level fails to develop and the plateaus at @xmath108 collapse into one single plateau at @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "then , we have the subsequent plateaus formerly at @xmath110 appearing at @xmath111 , and so on . further analysis about the quantum hall effect , taking into account the electron - electron interactions @xcite , should be carried out in a future work .    .",
