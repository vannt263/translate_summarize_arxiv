    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is an important frontier for studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology for several reasons .",
    "the igm is expected to be the main repository of baryons at all epochs , but the igm physical characteristics are predicted to change from predominantly cool ( @xmath13 k ) , photoionized gas at high redshifts to predominantly shock - heated `` warm - hot '' gas ( @xmath14 k ) at the current epoch ( cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al .",
    "the exchange of matter and energy between galaxies and the igm , e.g. , via gas accretion or supernova - driven `` feedback '' , may play profound roles in the evolution of galaxies , groups , and clusters ( voit 2005 ) .",
    "observations with the _ hubble _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) as well as the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ have shown that absorption lines are frequently detected in the spectra of low - redshift qsos ( e.g. , tripp et al . 2000 ; danforth & shull 2005 ; lehner et al .",

    "one means to investigate the nature and implications of absorbers is to study their relationships with nearby galaxies / galaxy structures ( e.g. , sembach et al .",

    "high - resolution uv spectra of pg0953 + 415 obtained with stis and _ fuse _ have revealed two strong , intervening absorbers in the pg0953 + 415 spectrum at @xmath5 = 0.06807 and 0.14232 ( tripp & savage 2000 ; savage et al .",
    "some improvements in the data reduction procedures , especially in the calfuse reduction software , were implemented after publication of those papers , so we have re - extracted the stis and _ fuse _ spectra as described in tripp et al .",

    "wavelength scale zero point by aligning ism lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum with comparable - strength lines in the stis spectrum ( e.g. , @xmath191144.94 and @xmath191608.45 ) .",
    "we remeasured absorption - line equivalent widths , column densities , and doppler parameters , and find good agreement with the measurements reported in savage et al .",

    "comparison of the doublet @xmath25 profiles indicates that the and lines at are somewhat affected by saturation . for these lines we use the @xmath25 profiles of the weaker line of the doublet , which provides a conservative lower limit on the column .",
    "the @xmath25 profiles at agree within the noise and show no indications of unresolved saturation , so in this case we further used the technique of jenkins & peimbert ( 1997 ) to construct weighted composite @xmath26 profiles derived from both members of the doublet .    to study the connections between galaxies and the pg0953 + 415 absorption systems , we have employed gmos ( hook et al .",
    "2004 ) on gemini - north to obtain galaxy redshifts .",
    "full details will be published in a subsequent paper ( b. aracil et al .",

    "the final image was constructed from individual exposures that were dithered to fill in the chip gaps and to allow cosmic ray rejection ; the total exposure time was 38 minutes .",
    "we used sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) to select galaxies from the gmos image for multislit follow - up spectroscopy with the gmos r150 grating and the gg455 order blocking filter ; this setup nominally covers the 4500   - 1 @xmath28 m wavelength range with a resolving power of @xmath29600 .",

    "inspection of the three - dimensional sdss galaxy distribution shows that these filaments are not merely coincidental projection effects ; these are real filaments and nodes of the `` cosmic web '' .",

    "the centroids , velocity widths , and overall line shapes of the and metal absorption lines of the pg0953 + 415 systems are remarkably similar .",
    "to show this , we overplot in figure  [ fig : nav ] the apparent column density [ @xmath26 ] profiles of the , , , and absorption lines detected at ( _ upper three panels _ ) and the and lines at ( _ lowest panel _ ) . for this purpose , we have scaled the metal @xmath26 profiles in figure  [ fig : nav ] to match the profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : nav ] provides several valuable observational constraints on the nature of these absorbers . beginning with the system , we see that the metal lines are precisely aligned with the absorption and the profile is narrow : @xmath49 ( ) = 21@xmath502",
    ". notably , _ the lines are far too narrow to arise in collisionally ionized gas in ionization equilibrium at the temperatures expected for . _",
    "the line width at implies that @xmath51 k ( @xmath52 ) , i.e. , an order of magnitude colder than the temperature required to produce in cie .",
    "moreover , the close match of the and the metal @xmath26 profiles strongly suggests that the and metal absorption lines originate in the same ( single - phase ) gas cloud .",
    "the aborption profile simplicity is another useful constraint .",
    "the system shows mainly one narrow component , which suggests that the absorber is a quiescent , undisturbed entity .",
    "the system ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : nav ] ) is kinematically more complex : at this redshift , six components spread over a velocity range of 450 are present in the ly@xmath53 profile ( see fig .",
    "6 in tripp & savage 2000 ) .",
    "also , this case affords fewer constraints on the gas ionization mechanism because and are not detected . nevertheless , it is interesting to note that in the main , strongest component ( at @xmath54  in figure  [ fig : nav ] ) , the and profiles are again seen to have very similar shapes , and again the lines are too narrow to arise in cie [ the main component at @xmath54 has @xmath49 ( ) @xmath55 km s@xmath16 ] .    the striking similarity of the and metal line profiles and the narrow widths of the lines are most easily understood if the gas is photoionized by the uv background light from qsos / agns . in photoionized absorbers ,",
    "the gas is expected to be cool and quiescent . in principle",
    ", these observations could alternatively indicate that the absorbers are not in ionization equilibrium and have cooled more rapidly than they can recombine . or , these could be multiphase absorbers , and the absorption associated with the hot phase is not detected .",
    "however , currently available non - equilibrium cooling gas models ( shapiro & moore 1976 ; schmutzler & tscharnuter 1993 ) require extraordinarily high metallicities ( @xmath57 ) for agreement with the observed columns and line widths in the pg0953 + 415 systems .",
    "based on these models , non - eq .",
    "cooling gas appears to be highly unlikely .",
    "using cloudy ( v96.01 , ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) , we have revisited the properties predicted for the absorber if it is photoionized .",
    "we adopt the recent solar abundance revisions ( see table 5 in savage et al . 2005 ) and the modified haardt & madau ( 1996 ) uv background.2 .",
    "we normalize the uv background to @xmath58 ergs s@xmath16 @xmath59 hz@xmath16 sr@xmath16 at 1 rydberg . ]",
    "we find that our updated photoionization model is mostly in good agreement with the results reported by savage et al .",
    "( 2002 ) : we find that the logarithmic gas metallicity [ m / h ] = @xmath10 , gas pressure @xmath60 @xmath61 k , and absorber thickness = 70@xmath62 kpc . in ",
    "2 we noted that the absorption is apparently affected by saturation , and therefore our column could be underestimated . applying the method of jenkins ( 1996 ) to correct the for saturation , we find that @xmath63 ( ) could be 0.25 dex higher than the value derived from profile fitting and direct integration of the 1037.6   line .",
    "this would seem to require an even higher metallicity .",
    "however , such an increase in would require a higher ionization parameter ( and therefore a lower density and larger absorber size ) in order to match the resulting increased / ratio , and the required change in metallicity would be small .",
    "if the absorber is also photoionized , then the ( albeit more limited ) observations again imply a low density and relatively high metallicity ( see savage et al .",
    "the pg0953 + 415 absorbers appear to be photoionized and metal - rich , and yet the nearest galaxies are relatively far from the sight line .",
    "other recent studies of absorber - galaxy connections have found similar results , i.e. , high - metallicity , highly ionized gas in large - scale structures but with no luminous galaxies within @xmath64 100 kpc ( e.g. , tumlinson et al .",
    "2005 ; aracil et al . 2006 ; prochaska et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the detection of enriched , photoionized absorbing gas is in contrast to the predictions that igm absorbers arise in collisionally - ionized metal - poor whim gas .",
    "our detection of kinematically simple photoionized gas so far from any galaxy also does not conform to the idea that igm o  vi arises predominantly in turbulent collisionally - ionized galactic outflows .",
    "how , then , did such chemically enriched gas end up more than 150 kpc away from any known luminous galaxy ?",
    "one possibility is that the absorbers arise in material that has been dynamically stripped out of a galaxy .",
    "it has long been known that tidally stripped gaseous structures can extend for many tens of kpc ( e.g. , yun , ho , & lo 1994 ) , and absorption is frequently detected in sight lines through the magellanic stream ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 ) , a nearby example of a dynamically stripped material .",
    "this hypothesis can explain the lack of a nearby luminous galaxy because the donor galaxy could be a faint satellite dwarf which would be hard to detect .",
    "the relatively high metallicity of the absorbers can also be understood because tidally stripped material can be significantly enriched ( reflecting the metallicity of the progenitor galaxy ) .",
    "tidal debris is often kinematically complex ( e.g. , bowen et al . 1994 ) , and while the system shows similarly complex kinematics , the absorber does not .",
    "in addition , both pg0953 + 415 systems have much lower column densities than well - studied tidal structures",
    ". however , _ fuse _ observations have revealed absorption at magellanic stream velocities without corresponding 21 cm emission ( sembach et al .",
    "2003 ) ; much tidal detritus is likely to have columns below the 21 cm detection threshold .",
    "it remains possible that the absorption arises in the lower - density , more quiescent periphery of a tidal structure .",
    "a more substantial problem is that in the magellanic stream is believed to be _ collisionally _ ionized due to interaction between the stream and a hot galactic halo , and the and low ions in the stream often show different velocity centroids and widths , unlike the pg0953 + 415 systems .",
    "however , some magellanic stream clouds are kinematically simple and even show and h@xmath65 absorption lines ( sembach et al .",
    "2001 ) , so tidal stripping can be a gentle process for at least some of the stripped gas .",
    "once the density of the tidal debris drops sufficiently , it will become highly ionized by uv background photoionization .",
    "however , galaxies are known to show a correlation between metallicity and luminosity ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) , so if the pg0953 + 415 systems were stripped out of a low - luminosity dwarf , one might expect the absorbers to have a lower metallicity .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that the pg0953 + 415 absorbers might have been mainly enriched by processes that occurred at high redshifts .",
    "recent studies indicate that star - forming , high@xmath4 galaxies can have near - solar metallicities at @xmath66 ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "2002 ; shapley et al . 2004 ; erb et al .",
    "2006 ) , and simcoe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have reported evidence that qso absorbers have high metallicities within 100 - 200 @xmath7 kpc of high@xmath4 galaxies .",
    "this hypothesis can explain the absence of a nearby galaxy in the case of the absorber toward pg0953 + 415 : if the enrichment occurred at @xmath67 , then the source galaxy could have moved a substantial distance away from the sight line during the time that has passed since the metals were injected into the igm . in this hypothesis , the metals could have been removed from the source galaxy by a supernova - driven outflow or by dynamical stripping ; in either case the enriched gas could settle into a quiescent state and thereafter remain highly ionized due to photoionization by the uv background . to test these ideas",
    ", it would be useful to measure the metallicities of the nearest galaxies .",
    "the three galaxies closest to the absorber ( see figure  [ fig : gmos_zoom ] ) are all emission - line galaxies , as are some of the closest galaxies at ( see aracil et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "comparison of the galaxy and absorber metallicities would provide additional constraints on the possible origin of the enrichment .",
