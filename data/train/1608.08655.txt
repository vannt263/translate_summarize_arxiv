    "using the analogy between quantum dynamics and classical dynamics with quantum fluctuations , the authors argue that the mentioned diffusion equation `` can describe a dynamics very close to the quantum dynamics of a system of identical particles . ''",
    "gottesman @xcite presented a model of classical bosons emphasizing the idea that indistinguishability is not an exclusive quantum property .",
    "the possibility of classical systems composed by indistinguishable particles is developed in @xcite .",

    "this is exactly the case for photons and approximately for electrons in a conductor . we know that quantum effects can be reproduced in a classical system _ with _",
    "an interaction potential .",
    "for example , the pauli exclusion principle for fermions is analogous to a potential that becomes infinite when two particles occupy the same state .",

    "we may ask what are the mean field potentials that keep the diffusion coefficient equal to @xmath3 even when the concentration is high .",
    "we conjecture that a free diffusion coefficient @xmath3 is a macroscopic manifestation of a non - interacting particle system at a microscopic level .",
    "we assume that a free diffusion coefficient can be associated to a system composed by non - interacting particles not only when the mean field potential is zero ; there are other cases corresponding to quantum statistics .    in other words ,",

    ", the hamiltonian has no interaction term ; occupation number in energy space may be different from free particle statistics due to quantum effects .",
    "we do not enter into the details of the microscopic level but , instead , develop a classical description based on an effective mean field potential that acts on a particle due to the presence of all the others .",
    "we argue that the absence of an interaction term at the microscopic level is manifested by a free diffusion coefficient in energy space . in the following ,",
    "we show that statistics for fermions , bosons and free classical particles can be derived from this assumption . as a bonus ,",
    "two new statistics are also obtained .",

    "since we arrived to it following the same procedure that took us to fermi - dirac , bose - einstein and maxwell - boltzmann distributions , we consider that a deeper analysis is worth it . as shown in the next section , we can get more information using the grand partition function .",
    "the necessity of identifying the particles that obey with specific names will arise in the next sections .",
    "we use the names _ ewkons _ and _ awerkons _ ( the greater and lower sister in tehuelche language ) for the particles obeying with @xmath51 equal 1 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "there is a problem with awerkons , since for large enough energy the equilibrium particle number , @xmath57 , becomes negative , and this implies a complex mean field potential .",
    "the proposition of a physical interpretation for awerkons would be rather speculative at this stage .",

    "therefore , @xmath64 this approach looks more involved than the usual one for deriving the grand partition function for bosons or fermions .",

    "many candidates have been proposed for the constituent of this dark energy and matter , but their nature remains elusive .",

    "for instance , using early dark energy parameterizations ( which encompass features of a large class of dynamical dark energy models ) , planck collaboration latest relesase implies that @xmath134 with a 95% confidence level , where @xmath135 is the present value of @xmath119 .",
    "another interesting case is the dark energy coupled scenarios @xcite , where there is a fifth force between dark matter particles mediated by the dark energy scalar field . in this case",
    "the results of @xcite show that @xmath135 does not differ from @xmath52 by more that @xmath136 .",
    "the result @xmath137 for a gas of ewkons at low temperature is a promising starting point for a candidate to dark energy or matter .",
    "a question for the future would be : is there any dark energy model such that the quantum field theory involved has classical particles with the statistics of ewkons ?",
    "generic models of slow roll dark energy such as those studied in @xcite has varying @xmath119 given by @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the hubble constant at present and at red - shift @xmath141 respectively , and @xmath142 .",
    "anyway , the conservative model - independent bound @xmath143 implies for ewkons with quadratic density of states the upper bound @xmath144 .",
    "there are several open problems that deserve further analysis in the future : a more general study of particle distributions in terms of @xmath19 , the search for a justification of the possible specific shape of the density of states , and the physical interpretation of a negative number of particles or a negative total energy for awerkons . we know that quantum effects related to the parity of a quantum state give rise to fermion and boson statistics , so it would be very important to determine what are the corresponding effects at the microscopic level that give rise to ewkon or awerkon statistics . taking for instance the model we studied with quadratic densitiy of states we may ask : could there be dark energy with a chemical potencial ( see ) such that @xmath145 has a similar cosmological dependence as slow - roll dark energy requires ?",
    "mass - varying neutrinos are another candidate for dark energy @xcite .",
    "could their classical statistics show ewkon like features ?",
