    "the hard bremsstrahlung contribution is strongly dependent on the available phase space as the mass suppression is removed for these terms .",
    "the size of the bremsstrahlung corrections is thus enhanced substantially through the large effective scale of the rg - sudakov form factor . in total , we find that the rg effects lead to an _ enhancement _ of the background of roughly a factor of two compared with the scale chosen in ref . @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that a similar effect for the sudakov form factor is also present in the signal @xmath120 , so that the rg - effects in the non - sudakov form factor - and in the misidentified @xmath25 background both sudakov _ and _ non - sudakov- will be decisive in a precise determination of the signal / bg ratio .",

    "this process is very important at a future plc as it contains the largest background to intermediate mass higgs production .",
    "the rg - improvement is achieved without encountering the ominous landau - pole singularities in the hard form factor although the all orders leading and next to leading rg - solution is incorporated .",
