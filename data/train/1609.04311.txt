    "several phenomena are often modeled by a continuous stochastic dynamics in which a noise term randomizes the motion of each degree of freedom .",
    "these noises can have a nontrivial structure .",
    "for example , hydrodynamic interactions between diffusing particles , due to the concerted motion of the fluid molecules , are represented by a cross - correlation of noise terms in langevin equations , with amplitudes proportional to the bath temperature  @xcite .",
    "finding the response of the system to a variation of one of the noise amplitudes is a task that encounters some mathematical difficulty . while a variation of deterministic drifts in diffusion equations may be dealt with by established tools  @xcite , such as the girsanov theorem  @xcite and radon - nikodym derivatives  @xcite , it is not straightforward to compare two dynamics driven by different noise amplitudes  @xcite , due to the missing absolute continuity between the two path measures .",
    "this might have hampered the definition of a linear response theory to temperature variations or in general to noise - amplitude variations .",
    "however , there are recent results in this direction  @xcite .",
    "the interest in understanding thermal response in nonequilibrium conditions is related to the definition of a steady state thermodynamics  @xcite , in which concepts as specific heat  @xcite are extended to the realm of dissipative steady states .    to circumvent issues related to the missing girsanov theorem for stochastic processes with different noise coefficients , some attempts to define a thermal linear response theory needed to resort to a time discretization  @xcite . recently , with two independent proofs  @xcite , it was proposed a solution avoiding this discretization .",
    "namely , a ( continuous time ) thermal response formula devoid of singular terms can be obtained either by an explicit regularization procedure based on functional methods @xcite or through a coordinate rescaling which turns noise perturbations into mechanical ones @xcite .",
    "this formalism was developed for uncorrelated noises and applied to an experiment of a thermally unbalanced rc circuit  @xcite , determining its nonequilibrium heat capacitance  @xcite .",
    "however , for example , the scheme described in  @xcite can not be applied to hydrodynamically coupled particles .",
    "a recent experiment realized a minimal hydrodynamic system composed of nearby optically trapped colloids , in which one colloid is shaken by randomly displacing the optical trap position .",
    "it has been shown that this random displacement plays the role of an effective temperature for the shaken particle , whose motion in some sense is `` hotter '' than that of the other particle  @xcite .",
    "the result is equivalent to a system in which heat bath as a whole is out of equilibrium .",
    "not only does each degree of freedom experience a different temperature , but also the global structure of the stochastic equations does not meet the standard form of local detailed balance  @xcite .",
    "thus , for such a system it is not straightforward to define concepts like entropy production in the environment .",
    "a thermal response in this context is possible , as shown with a theory including correlated white noise terms  @xcite .",
    "this approach , following the scheme presented in  @xcite , still included a time discretization for overcoming the mathematical difficulties mentioned above , hence it was not yet written in terms only of sensible mathematical expressions such as ( stochastic ) integrals , but also included discrete sums of terms which are singular in the limit of continuous time .",
    "in this paper we provide the most general thermal response theory for overdamped diffusive motions with additive correlated white noise , using a formulation based on path weights  @xcite .",
    "we thus merge the positive aspects of recent approaches in a single , general framework , which could be used to study how a diffusive process reacts to a variation of one or many of its noise amplitudes .",
    "this formalism is adopted to analyse the data of the experiment involving hydrodynamically coupled particles mentioned above , showing how to apply the scheme in practice .",
    "pragmatically , a matrix formulation simplifies this last step . in this way , after the previous analysis of nonequilibrium @xmath6 circuits  @xcite , we continue the application of a thermal response theory to experimental data .",
    "this complements earlier analysis of experiments focused on the mechanical linear response  @xcite .    having computed the system s susceptibility to a variation of the random driving ,",
    "we show that there is a good agreement with another estimate obtained using seifert and speck s formula  @xcite .",
    "this is in the class of formulas that focus on the density of states or related quantities  @xcite , and hence can be general enough to embrace also the thermal response type of problem .",
    "note that an integrated version of the latter formula  @xcite was recently connected with a statistical reweighting scheme that reappropriates data obtained from a stationary experiment as data obtained by an actual perturbation protocol .",
    "also in this case , one needs to know the steady state distribution .",
    "the following section introduces the experiment we will analyse . dealing first with a real system helps in motivating the need for the new theory and in exposing the derivation of suitable fluctuation - response relations ( section  [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "these are the response function to a variation of an element of the inverse diffusion matrix ( eq .  ) , and the susceptibility obtained by integrating in time a combination of these response functions , see eq .  , or eq .   for its version in matrix notation . the susceptibility of the potential energy , either of the system or of the particle not driven , is derived from the steady state experimental data in section  [ sec : sus_coll ] , which is followed by conclusions and by further details in appendices .",
    "the two particles interaction is studied in the following experimental setup . a custom - built vertical optical tweezers with an oil - immersion objective ( hcx pl .",
    "apo @xmath7/@xmath8-@xmath9 ) focuses a laser beam ( wavelength ) to create a quadratic potential well where a silica bead ( radius @xmath10 ) can be trapped .",
    "the beam goes through an acousto - optic deflector ( aod ) that allows to modify the position of the trap very rapidly ( up to ) . by switching the trap at between two positions we create two independent traps , which allows us to hold two beads separated by a fixed distance ( a schematic drawing is shown in figure  [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the beads are dispersed in bidistilled water at low concentration to avoid interactions with multiple other beads .",
    "the solution of beads is contained in a disk - shaped cell ( in diameter , @xmath11 in depth ) .",
    "the beads are trapped at @xmath12 above the bottom surface of the cell .",
    "the position of the beads is tracked by a fast camera with a resolution of per pixel , which after treatment gives the position with an accuracy better than .",
    "the trajectories of the bead are sampled at .",
    "the stiffness of one trap ( @xmath13 for trap @xmath14 or @xmath15 for trap @xmath16 , each representing an element of a diagonal stiffness matrix @xmath17 , see next section ) is proportional to the laser intensity .",
    "the two particles are trapped on a line ( called `` x axis '' ) and separated by a distance @xmath18 which is tunable .",
    "the experimental results presented here have been obtained at @xmath19 . at this distance",
    "the coulombian interaction between the particle surfaces is negligible .",
    "are confined in independent harmonic potentials @xmath20 generated by optical traps .",
    "the particles interact hydrodynamically ( @xmath21 ) , and the first particle experiences an effective temperature produced by randomly moving the position of the trap .",
    "the difference between this effective temperature and the water one ( @xmath22 ) mimics an additional thermal environment setting the system out of equilibrium . ]    to create an effective temperature on one of the particles ( for example on particle @xmath14 ) , a gaussian white noise is sent to the aod so that the position of the corresponding trap is moved randomly in the direction where the particles are aligned .",
    "if the amplitude of the displacement is sufficiently small to stay in the linear regime it creates a random force on the particle which does not affect the stiffness of the trap . here",
    "the particles are over - damped and have a lorentzian power spectrum with a typical cut - off frequency @xmath23 of .",
    "the added noise is numerically created by a labview program : it is sampled at with a tunable amplitude @xmath24 ( typically of @xmath25 ) and numerically low - pass filtered at .",
    "it is then generated by the analog output of a ni pxie-6366 card .",
    "the conversion factor for the displacement due to the aod is , and the typical voltage of the noise after filtration is between @xmath26 .",
    "when the random force is switched on , the bead quickly reaches a stationary state with an `` effective temperature '' @xmath27 for the randomly forced degree of freedom . here",
    "the parameter @xmath22 quantifies the strength of the forcing ( see eq .",
    "below ) and will be used also as the tunable strength of the thermal perturbation .",
    "the properties of the effective temperature @xmath28 have been studied using power spectra @xcite and fluctuations theorems @xcite .",
    "this setup allows us to create a wide range of effective temperatures for one bead , and to look at the interaction between this agitated bead and another one trapped at equilibrium at a finite distance @xmath18 .",
    "let us consider a system with @xmath29 degrees of freedom , whose state is a vector denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "we write the equation of motion of our overdamped system in matrix notation as @xmath31 where the vector @xmath32 is the mean drift velocity , and the @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 is the noise amplitude , which is assumed to be independent of the state @xmath35 .",
    "the differential noise @xmath36 is gaussian and colorless as well as uncorrelated among different components , _",
    "i.e_. , @xmath37 .",
    "explicit time dependences of @xmath35 , @xmath38 , and possibly @xmath39 and @xmath34 , are omitted for simplifying the notation , except for occasions when emphasis is appropriate .",
    "furthermore , as has already been hinted at , we will alternate between matrix and index notations according to whichever is more intelligible in specific situations .    as an example , the drift vector of a hydrodynamic system is given in terms of the deterministic force @xmath40 and of the mobility matrix @xmath41 , @xmath42 due to hydrodynamic interactions , the mobility matrix has nonvanishing off - diagonal entries @xmath43 that couple different degrees of freedom @xmath44 . in general this would result in a state - dependent mobility , since the coupling depends on the difference of coordinates .",
    "however , we are concerned with an experiment where a state - independent mobility is a viable approximation : the hydrodynamic coupling between distant degrees of freedom is in the form of a series expansion in the ratio of particle radius to distance @xcite .",
    "hence , if the system is maintained such that the average distance is considerably larger than its fluctuations , it can be assumed to remain constant at its average value to lowest order .",
    "the optical traps in the considered experimental setup are `` stiff '' enough to achieve just that .",
    "the resulting mobility matrix , to the aforementioned level of approximation , for this system with @xmath45 is given as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a small hydrodynamic coupling between spherical colloids of radius @xmath48 separated by a(n average ) distance @xmath18 according to the oseen approximation ( @xmath49 in the experiment we consider ) , and @xmath50 is the drag coefficient of the colloids in water .",
    "the distance @xmath18 is set by the separation of the two harmonic optical traps , whose associated potential energy is @xmath51 when each coordinate is measured with respect to the center of its corresponding trap , where @xmath17 is a diagonal matrix of stiffness constants .    as a result of the form of the mobility matrix , the diffusivity @xmath52",
    "is also endowed with nonvanishing off - diagonal entries that are state - independent .",
    "in fact , in the given experimental setup , the diffusivity is a sum of two contributions @xcite @xmath53 the first of which originates from the solvent at temperature @xmath54 , and the second from the stochastic forcing on particle @xmath14 , which has a white power spectrum of magnitude @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "our aim is to investigate the response of the system to a small variation in its diffusion matrix , which is the most direct analog of temperature in this multidimensional situation .",
    "however , it is better to begin the treatment in terms of the noise amplitude , which is less physical , and revert to diffusivity at an appropriate stage .",
    "we begin by perturbing the noise prefactor matrix as , @xmath56 and then follow the technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is unfettered by terms that depend on the time discretization . to this end , we change variables by defining @xmath57 which implies @xmath58 plugging this into the equation of motion , and multiplying it by @xmath59 from the left , one has @xmath60 to first order in @xmath61 . before proceeding with the simplification",
    "any further , one sees that the whole point of this exercise was to rid the noise process of its perturbed prefactor , and make the perturbation appear elsewhere .",
    "note the argument @xmath35 , rather than @xmath62 , of @xmath32 in eq .  .",
    "in order to arrive at an equation of motion for the coordinate @xmath62 , we therefore have to expand : @xmath63 where a summation is implied over repeated indices , and the difference @xmath64 was given by eq .  .",
    "noting also that @xmath65 to first order , we can proceed with the simplification of eq .   to find @xmath66    -({\\delta",

    "after the convenience of this parameter is duly exploited , it will be rewritten in terms of the diffusivity rather than the noise prefactor .",
    "finally , we can rearrange eq .   into @xmath69 where @xmath70 with @xmath71 according to eq .",
    "thus , the perturbation of the noise prefactor in the evolution of @xmath35 has been re - expressed as a perturbation of the mechanical force in the evolution of @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite discusses another perspective from which this deformation of a thermal perturbation into a deterministic perturbation can be viewed .",
    "note that the `` pseudo - force '' @xmath72 depends explicitly on time through the perturbation @xmath73 .",

    "note that the term of the time - symmetric part proportional to @xmath150 , while in general nonzero , disappears for the particular system in question , since two derivatives of the mean drift @xmath151 vanish due to the quadratic potential .",
    "experimental data were sampled at constant rate , with a time step @xmath152 .",
    "this means that a trajectory is a discrete collection of points @xmath153 with @xmath154 .",
    "for each temperature we have a long time series composed of @xmath155 samples , out of which we extract @xmath156 trajectories by shifting the initial point .",
    "thus , these trajectories are partially overlapped with other ones .",
    "since the autocorrelation time of the system is about @xmath157ms @xmath158 , we have taken the correlation of data into account by amplifying the error bars in our results ( standard deviations ) by a factor of @xmath159 .",
    "velocities are defined as @xmath160/\\delta t$ ] .",
    "the integrals in eq .   or eq .",
    "follow the stratonovich convention . in their time - discretized version , quantities (",
    "other than the @xmath161 mentioned above ) in the integrals are averaged over time steps .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as a second example , we show the susceptibility to a change of @xmath22 of the energy @xmath163 of the second particle , namely the colloid which is not experiencing the random forcing directly . yet , due to the hydrodynamic interaction , its energy on average increases with @xmath22 , as manifested by the susceptibilities plotted in figure  [ fig : u2 ] .",
    "again , there is a fair agreement between the two estimates .",
    "the comparison with previous numerical estimates @xcite , which gave very similar curves but for other values of parameters , corroborates the validity of these results .",
    "we have proposed a quite general formalism for estimating the linear response of an overdamped stochastic system to a variation of its ( additive ) white - noise amplitude .",
    "this is a useful tool for analyzing the response of experimental data , as for the discussed system of two hydrodynamically coupled colloids in optical traps , for which we are able to compute the susceptibility to a change of an external random driving that reproduces a sort of higher temperature for only one of the colloids . yet , note that our formalism if quite flexible and can be applied to more abstract stochastic diffusive dynamics with correlated noise .",
    "the next evolution of this approach should try to complete the picture by dealing with systems with multiplicative noise .",
    "also the thermal response for nonequilibrium inertial systems should be developed without resorting to the time - discretization used in a previous work  @xcite .",
    "this would allow , for example , to determine nonequilibrium steady - state thermal susceptibilities of the fermi - pasta - ulam model  @xcite or other hamiltonian models of heat conduction .    similarly to the linear response of nonequilibrium systems to mechanical perturbations , we note that the susceptibility to temperature changes arises from dissipative as well as non - dissipative aspects of the dynamics .",
    "this differs from the simple structure of response theory for equilibrium systems , where only correlations between heat fluxes ( i.e. , dissipation ) and observable are relevant for computing susceptibilities . with these considerations in mind ,",
    "the kind of fluctuation - response relations we discussed might be used to better understand and quantify the thermal response of nonequilibrium systems such as relaxing glasses  @xcite and active matter  @xcite .",
    "here we briefly sketch the calculation of the stationary distribution of the system , for the sake of completeness .    with a drift @xmath164 linear in @xmath35 ,",
    "the equation of motion describes an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , which we rewrite here as @xmath165 with @xmath166 . according to the corresponding fokker - planck equation , @xmath167",
    ", stationarity requires the ensemble current @xmath168 to be divergenceless , yielding @xmath169 clearly , a gaussian distribution of the form @xmath170 satisfies the zero divergence condition above . to find the inverse covariance matrix @xmath171 ,",
    "one substitutes the ansatz , upon which a few lines of algebra implies the condition @xmath172 this is a system of linear equations in the elements of the covariance matrix @xmath173 , which can be solved , for instance , by rewriting it in terms of a vector composed of the columns of @xmath173 . here",
    ", we simply quote the resulting matrix : recalling @xmath166 with @xmath17 diagonal and @xmath41 given in eq .  , and @xmath144 given in eq .",
    ", one finds @xmath174 inversion of this matrix thus determines the stationary distribution .",
    "even though it may sometimes be more convenient mathematically to work in terms of the noise amplitude @xmath34 , it is the diffusivity matrix @xmath144 which is physically relevant , since the noise amplitude is fixed only up to an orthogonal transformation .",
    "hence the perturbation parameter , @xmath175 , defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : cov ] in terms of the noise amplitude should eventually be expressed in terms of a perturbation of the diffusivity . with @xmath176 and @xmath177 , in line with sec .",
    "[ sec : cov ] , the definitions @xmath178 and @xmath81 imply that @xmath179 note that one should not expect to solve this equation for @xmath61 uniquely given a specific @xmath180 ; many noise coefficient matrices @xmath34 map into the same diffusion matrix @xmath144 .    the relation above can now be used to express the perturbation parameter @xmath175 in terms of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , but not uniquely , which is not a problem . multiplying eq .   by @xmath183 from the left and right , one easily finds @xmath184 the left hand side of this equation is equal to @xmath185 ( verified easily by varying the identity @xmath186 ) which is determined by the physical description of the perturbation .",
    "meanwhile , the right hand side of the equation is twice the symmetric part of @xmath187 . in other words",
    ", it is only the symmetric part of @xmath187 that is fixed by the physical form of the perturbation , and the antisymmetric part is left undetermined .",
    "it therefore behooves one to choose @xmath187 to be purely symmetric , whence one obtains @xmath188 , or @xmath189 where the second equality is valid due to the overarching first order approximation of linear response .",
    "in this appendix , we sketch how the asymptotic values for the susceptibilities in figures [ fig : u ] and [ fig : u2 ] were obtained .    one can derive a host of relations valid in the stationary regime by requiring that time derivatives of state observables vanish @xcite .",
    "for the present discussion , the relevant observable is the tensor @xmath190 , _",
    "i.e_. , @xmath191 with the backward generator @xmath192 .",
    "( one should keep in mind that the average is in the stationary regime , although we leave it unlabeled . ) when evaluated explicitly , with @xmath193 , one finds the relation @xmath194 this matrix relation entails a set of equations for the independent components of the tensor @xmath195 , of which there are 3 in our case with 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that for our system , @xmath196 .",
    "thus , multiplying eq .   from the left by @xmath197 and taking the trace , we find the stationary average of the potential energy to be @xmath198 hence , the stationary ( asymptotic ) value for the susceptibility",
    "is found as @xmath199 which was evaluated using eq .   for the diffusion matrix .",
    "this asymptotic value for @xmath200 was indicated in figure [ fig : u ] .",
    "the susceptibility of the energy of the second particle @xmath201 can be extracted similarly from eq .  , with the exception that one has to go through the tedium of actually solving for the component @xmath202 .",
    "we quote only the result of this straightforward exercise : @xmath203 this was evaluated as @xmath204 for the actual experimental values of @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 , and indicated in figure [ fig : u2 ] as the asymptotic value of the susceptibility @xmath200 .",
