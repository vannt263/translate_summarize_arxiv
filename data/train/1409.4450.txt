    "our analysis is focused on the year 2012 .",
    "we collected the neighbors of 93,491 pages created during that year . for each created page we considered the two weeks before and after its creation , and measured the volume of traffic to its topic in each week .",
    "we characterize the typical traffic to the topic in the week after and before with the median traffic to neighbors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "let us define infra - week traffic volume change @xmath7 , total volume @xmath8 , and relative volume change @xmath9 .    for comparison purposes , we collected the neighbors of a roughly equally - sized sample of pre - existing articles ( created before 2012 ) and analogously computed their relative infra - week changes in traffic volume over random two - week windows in 2012 .",
    "articles in the baseline sample are older and therefore tend to have more neighbors , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : change](a ) .",
    "this and other temporal effects are discounted by considering the relative change in volume @xmath9 ( see methods ) .    we observe that the volume change @xmath10 scales sublinearly with the total volume @xmath11 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : change](b ) .",
    "consequently @xmath12 goes to zero as @xmath11 increases . while the distributions of @xmath9 are sharply peaked around zero in both samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig : change](c ) ) , they are different : a non - parametric kolmogorov - smirnov test rejects the null hypothesis that the two samples of relative traffic change are drawn from the same distribution ( @xmath13 ) ; an anderson - darling test , which gives less weight to the median values of the distribution in favor of the tails , yields similar results .",
    "one way to quantify and interpret the difference between the two distributions is to compute the ratio of odds that a given change in traffic volume is observed when a page is created versus when a page has existed for a specific amount of time .",
    "[ fig : change](d ) plots the log odds as a function of @xmath9 . for example",
    "@xmath14 is over two orders of magnitude more likely to be observed in a new page compared to a page of generic but fixed age .",
    "as shown in the figure , this effect holds even when we consider only neighborhoods with a high volume of traffic , which may be indicative of more developed , and hence more popular topics . in summary , while we find both instances in which bursts in demand precede ( @xmath15 ) and follow ( @xmath16 ) the generation of new knowledge , comparison with the baseline yields a significant shift towards the former case , suggesting that consumption anticipates the production of information .",
    "which kinds of articles precede or follow demand for information ? in table  [ tab : topbursts ] we list a few articles with the largest positive and negative bursts .",
    "topics that precede demand ( @xmath16 ) tend to be about current and possibly unexpected events , such as a military operation in the middle east and the killing of the u.s .",
    "ambassador in libya .",
    "these articles are created almost instantaneously with the event , to meet the subsequent demand .",
    "articles that follow demand ( @xmath15 ) tend to be created in the context of topics that already attract significant attention , such as elections , sport competitions , and anniversaries .",
    "for example , the page about titanic survivor rhoda abbott was created in the wake of the 100th anniversary of the sinking .",
    "our result shows that in many cases , demand for information precedes its supply .",
    "we propose a model to interpret this finding , analogous to the law of supply and demand @xcite .",
    "an increase in demand indicates a willingness to pay a higher price for a physical good , which in turn leads to an increase in supply . in the domain of information",
    ", attention plays the role of price : an increase in demand for information about a topic indicates a higher attention toward that topic , which in turns leads to the generation of additional information about it .",
    "this model predicts a causal link between demand and supply of information .",
    "our empirical observations are consistent with this prediction , and may represent a first step toward the development of the fundamental laws of the attention economy .    of course , not all requests are generated as a result of demand for information .",
    "a number of requests to related articles are likely to be generated by the very creators of new entries ; one could hardly create new knowledge about some topic without consulting existing pages about it .",
    "this is a source of potential bias for our measure of demand especially in the case of low - traffic topics , such as entries about small towns or niche musical bands . on the other hand , significant bursts in volume",
    "are observed for popular topics as well ( cf . figure  [ fig : change](d ) ) .",
    "such bursts could not possibly be generated by the activity of contributors , who are a small percentage of the wikipedia audience @xcite .    as a practical consequence of our finding",
    ", volumetric data about collective attention , such as searches , reviews , and ratings , which now abound online , may be used as indicators of what kinds of new ideas and innovations will ensue .    whether there is a hard causal link between demand and supply remains an open question .",
    "our main contribution here has been to establish a quantitative relation between the timing of demand and supply of information .",
    "a definition of `` information '' is more elusive than that of material goods ; and quantifying demand is particularly hard in this case .",
    "our analysis focuses on aggregate - level behaviors .",
    "models of individual browsing behavior could shed more light on how people allocate their attention among competing information stimuli online .",
    "given the sensitive nature of the personal information revealed by individual browsing habits , validating such models with data is a challenge , as revealed by the recent discussions about the trade - offs between data - driven social science research and individual privacy rights .",
    "nevertheless , further empirical analyses and theoretical models of individual and collective dynamics of attention will lead a better understanding of the social exchange of knowledge in online and offline information networks .",
    "in our analysis we used the public dataset generated by the servers of the wikimedia foundation .",
    "traffic volume is the number of non - unique http requests that an article receives , as a proxy for the popularity of the subject @xcite .",
    "we collected data about hourly traffic to the neighbors of wikipedia articles created during 2012 .",
    "the data were pre - processed for analysis .",
    "we conflated titles that automatically redirect to other entries .",
    "we used the information in the ` redirect ' table to perform this check .",
    "we considered only pages created by humans , using a recent list of all known bots to discard automatically - generated pages .",
    "neighbors were found by looking at the ` pagelinks ' table , after resolving redirects .      to check whether a page was actually created during 2012",
    "we consulted the time stamp of its earliest recorded revision ( the reference time stamp ) .",
    "unfortunately , this information is not always accurate since wikipedia pages can be merged , migrated , have their edit history fully or partially deleted , or even lost .",
    "we thus checked that no traffic to the page had been recorded in our dataset in a 50-week exclusion window before the reference time stamp .",
    "however , because it is customary to include links to missing entries in order to encourage other contributors to create them , we found this criterion to produce too many false negatives .",
    "we settled for a small threshold , allowing pages with at most 5% ( 420 ) non - null hourly observations in the exclusion window .      at its earliest stage",
    "a wikipedia article rarely contains more than a handful of sentences and links . as a consequence , looking at the early set of neighbors would yield very sparse information . on the other hand , deletion of links",
    "is rare @xcite .",
    "therefore we collected the neighbors that link to and are linked by the page at the present day .",
    "let us consider a focal page with @xmath17 neighbours and an observation window of length @xmath18 centered around a reference time @xmath19 , which is the time when the page is created .",
    "the total traffic volume each neighbor receives before and after @xmath19 corresponds to random variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the average volume change @xmath22 indicates whether , on average , attention to a neighbor is more concentrated before the creation of the page ( @xmath23 ) or after ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "even though it accounts for the broad distribution of neighborhood sizes ( see fig  2(a ) ) , @xmath25 does not guarantee a fair comparison between topics for two reasons : first , the distribution of attention across topics is broad ( as shown in fig .",
    "3 ) ; second , web traffic is known to follow circadian , weekly , and seasonal rhythms @xcite . over a week , an overall change in traffic volume @xmath26 visits may represent a dramatic surge of attention if observed over a group of pages that average @xmath27 visits per week .",
    "however , it would be barely noticeable if the same pages averaged @xmath28 visits per week . to overcome these problems ,",
    "let us define the relative ( median ) traffic change : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the median traffic over a neighbor .",
    "we choose to use the median since it is a more robust estimator in the presence of outliers , and almost every article in our samples has at least one very high - traffic neighbor ( e.g. , `` united states '' ) , whose volume of traffic is insensitive to all but the most high - profile events recorded in the dataset .",
    "we also repeated our analysis using the sample mean and found qualitatively similar results .",
    "the length @xmath18 of the observation window must be chosen considering a trade - off between competing requirements .",
    "most attention spikes tend to be relatively brief  on the scale of the day  and so the value of @xmath18 should not be too large , to avoid lumping together consecutive attention bursts . on the other hand , because of the strong circadian and weekly cycles that we see in fig .  1 , @xmath18 can not be too small , otherwise these fluctuations would dominate the signal for all but the largest bursts .",
    "we therefore consider a two - week observation window ( @xmath31 days ) , centered at the time of creation of the new page .      to collect the baseline data we drew at random without replacement an existing page ( i.e. , created before 2012 ) for each new page , and extracted traffic to its neighbors at a random time stamp during 2012 .",
    "we also repeated the analysis with a different baseline sample , where instead of a random time stamp we used the time of creation of the associated new page , and found similar results .",
    "the authors would like to thank richard shiffrin , filippo radicchi , and yong - yeol ahn for useful suggestions , and john mccurley for his help with revising the manuscript .",
    "we acknowledge the wikimedia foundation for making the data available . this work was supported in part by the swiss national science foundation ( fellowship 142353 ) ,",
    "nsf ( grant ccf-1101743 ) , the lilly endowment , and the james s. mcdonnell foundation .",
    "the authors declare that they have no competing financial interests .",
    ".top wikipedia entries by relative traffic change in absolute value @xmath32 .",
    "we consider articles whose neighbors received at least @xmath33 visits per day , and report the total traffic @xmath34 within the entire two - week window . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]"
