    "the fact that  and  trace the same clumps of gas allow estimates of the density and temperature in localized regions .",
    "if the regions are within the positional error bars of @xmath5-ray emission , these estimates may provide interesting information of the conditions of gas that may be linked with cosmic ray acceleration . here",
    "we discuss the density and positions of the shocked regions with respect to the snrs .",
    "@xcite estimated the conditions conducive for  36  ghz and 44  ghz masers in snrs .",
    "their results show a comparably brighter 36  ghz maser in higher density regimes ( @xmath22 @xmath4 ) , and a more dominant 44  ghz maser at lower densities ( @xmath23  @xmath4 ) for an optimal temperature @xmath24  k. the ( 3,3 ) inversion transition of  has a temperature of about 100 k above ground , and therefore the emission distribution will emphasize excited gas .  maser emission can occur via collisions with h@xmath7 molecules @xcite . through statistical calculations",
    "it was found that  masers occur in gas with temperatures around 200  k and densities on the order of @xmath25 @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consistent with previous calculations , the molpop - cep estimates performed for our snr environment ( sect .",
    "[ modeling ] ) show optimal  maser conditions at relatively high temperatures ( @xmath26  k ) and a relatively narrow density peak around @xmath27 @xmath4 . at those densities ,",
    "there is , in fact , little difference in the inverted optical depth between the 36  ghz and 44  ghz masers @xcite , perhaps explaining the range of line ratios observed in the snrs ( table [ tbl-3 ] ) , where in some locations the 36  ghz maser is brighter , and the 44  ghz maser in others .",
    "that the line ratios of the 36  ghz and 44  ghz  are on average unity further agrees with a relatively high temperature in the clumps .",
    "it thus seems that the co - located clumps of  and  masers trace gas regions with @xmath26 k and @xmath27@xmath4 .",
    "g1.4@xmath28 is the exception , where both 36  ghz  and  emission is profuse and 44  ghz is lacking . here , the linewidths of the  are greater and the emission may be at least partly thermal . in this case , the 36  ghz methanol might be tracing the densest clumps in the interaction regions",
    ". a better understanding of the  thermal versus non - thermal emission here could be attained by also obtaining observations of the nh@xmath9(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emission that may be thermal , providing even stronger limits on the temperature and density .",
    "interferometric observations would also be helpful to tie down the brightness temperature of the  lines .",
    "the general picture of the spatial distribution of collisionally pumped masers in snrs was outlined in sect .",
    "1 , where regions close to the shock front harbor 36 ghz ch@xmath9oh masers , and post - shock regions harbor 1720 mhz oh masers .",
    "this depiction was based largely on observations of sgr a east , w28 , and g1.4@xmath00.1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with our new data ,",
    "this picture is further strengthened .",
    "first , our comparison ( figs .",
    "@xmath29 ) of the nh@xmath9 , ch@xmath9oh , and co(@xmath30 ) shows a strong correlation in position and velocity , where both nh@xmath9 and ch@xmath9oh are directly associated with the nearby mcs . as evidenced by the co maps , the extent of the mcs follows and is associated with radio continuum contours .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of snr / mc interactions , providing the necessary excitation mechanism for both nh@xmath9 and ch@xmath9oh .",
    "second , the oh maser velocities listed in table 1 are , for most cases , offset in velocity from the ch@xmath9oh and nh@xmath9 . again , this may imply that the oh is occuring further in the post - shock region , resulting in a different velocity than the gas closer to the front .",
    "an illustrating example is w44 , which is interacting with a giant mc ( co g34.875@xmath00.625 ) with a v@xmath31 around 48 kms@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the brightest rim of this mc is overlapping with the brightest rim of the continuum emission ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the nh@xmath9 and ch@xmath9oh clumps coincide in position and velocity with the mc , but are offset from the oh detection .",
    "noteworthy details include the snr candidate g5.7@xmath00.0 .",
    "the centroid velocity of the nh@xmath9 emission is around @xmath32 kms@xmath2 , almost 40 kms@xmath2 offset from the known oh maser at @xmath33 kms@xmath2 @xcite , but instead matches well with the velocity of the co emission detected at the same position sw of the radio continuum ( fig .",
    "2 ) . to the ne ,",
    "closer to the oh maser , the co gas instead has a higher , positive velocity ( 3 to 23 kms@xmath2 ) agreeing with the oh velocity @xcite .",
    "this may be understood with the gas density differences required for the excitation of the transitions .",
    "w44 , w51c , and g5.7@xmath00.0 are all detected in @xmath5-rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are thought to originate from the snr / mc interaction . in w44",
    ", for example , @xcite report on using a pre - shock density of 200 cm@xmath2 and a post - shock density of @xmath34 @xmath4 , almost 15 times smaller than the post - shocked density close to the shock front we have derived .",
    "if the @xmath5-rays , just as the 36 ghz masers , are produced close to the shock front , our derived densities may provide additional information for the @xmath5-ray emission estimated from neutral pion decay models .",
    "the combination of the presented gbt and vla data have shown there is a close correlation between  and  36  ghz and 44  ghz maser emission in snrs interacting with mcs . that the  is truly maser emission",
    "is not confirmed , but under this assumption the data is consistent with clumps of gas of densities @xmath35 @xmath4 and temperatures @xmath36 k.    we would like to thank joe masters and jim braatz of nrao for their help with the gbtpipeline , toney minter for his help with the gbt observations and calibration , crystal brogan for providing the w51c and g5.7@xmath00.0 continuum images and betsy mills for her discussion about the ammonia observations .",
