    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dots ( qd s ) created at semiconductor interfaces with refined control of their size , shape and number of electrons are often referred@xcite to as `` artificial atoms '' . for high magnetic fields ( @xmath1 ) , it has been known for some time ( ever since the pioneering work @xcite of laughlin in 1983 concerning the fractional quantum hall effect ) that 2d few - electron systems exhibit complex strongly - correlated many - body physics .",
    "nevertheless , for low magnetic fields , the term artificial atoms was used initially to suggest that the physics of electrons in such man - made nanostructures is exclusively related to that underlying the traditional description@xcite of natural atoms ( pertaining particularly to electronic shells and the aufbau principle ) , where the electrons are taken @xcite to be moving in a spherically averaged effective central mean field .",
    "this traditional picture was given support by experimental studies@xcite on vertical qd s , which were followed@xcite by a series of sophisticated theoretical investigations yielding results conforming to it .",
    "however , in 1999 , the circular ( for 2d qd s ) central - mean - field picture was challenged by the discovery of solutions with broken _ space _ symmetry in the context of spin - and - space unrestricted hartree - fock ( ss - uhf ) mean - field calculations.@xcite these broken symmetry ( bs ) solutions appear spontaneously ( due to a phase transition ) when the strength of the interelectron repulsion relative to the zero - point kinetic energy ( @xmath2 ) exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "they indicate formation of wigner ( or electron ) molecules ( wm s or em s ) with the electrons located at the vertices of nested regular polygons ( often referred to as concentric rings ) , familiar from studies of classical point charges.@xcite such molecules were characterized by us as strong or weak wigner crystallites depending on their rigidity or lack thereof ( i.e. , floppiness ) , suggesting the existence of additional@xcite `` phase transitions '' as a function of the parameter @xmath2 ( see section ii.b for its precise definition ) .",
    "furthermore , it was noted@xcite that the symmetry breaking should be accompanied by the emergence of a spectrum of collective rovibrational excitations ( finite - size analogs of the goldstone modes ) .",
    "a subsequent investigation@xcite based on exact solutions for a helium qd ( 2e qd ) confirmed these results and provided a systematic study of the molecular rovibrational collective spectra and their transition to independent particle excitations , as the rigidity of the wm was reduced through variation of the controlling parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we remark here that the lower - energy bs uhf solutions already capture@xcite part of the correlation energy , compared to the restricted hf ( rhf ) ones . improved numerical accuracy has been achieved in subsequent studies@xcite through the restoration of the broken symmetries via projection techniques .",
    "consequently , the methodology of symmetry breaking at the uhf mean - field level and of subsequent symmetry restoration via post hartree - fock methods@xcite provides a systematic controlled hierarchy of approximations toward the exact solution , with anticipated advantages for complex many electron systems ( under field - free conditions@xcite and in the presence of a magnetic field@xcite ) , whose treatment is computationally prohibitive with other methods ( e.g. , exact diagonalization ) .      the mean field approach has been a useful tool in elucidating the physics of small fermionic systems , from natural atoms and atomic nuclei to metallic nanoclusters , and most recently of two - dimensional quantum dots .",
    "of particular interest for motivating the present work ( due to spatial - symmetry - breaking aspects ) has been the mean - field description of deformed nuclei and metal clusters ( exhibiting ellipsoidal shapes ) . at a first level",
    ", deformation effects in these systems can be investigated via semi - empirical mean - field models , like the particle - rotor model@xcite of bohr and mottelson ( nuclei ) , the anisotropic - harmonic - oscillator model of nilsson ( nuclei@xcite and metal clusters@xcite ) , and the shell - correction method of strutinsky ( nuclei@xcite and metal clusters@xcite ) . at the microscopic level ,",
    "the mean field is often described@xcite via the self - consistent single - determinantal hartree - fock ( hf ) theory . at this level , however , the description of deformation effects mentioned above requires@xcite consideration of unrestricted hartree - fock wave functions that break explicitly the rotational symmetries of the original many - body hamiltonian , but yield hf determinants with lower energy compared to the symmetry - adapted restricted hartree - fock solutions .    in earlier publications,@xcite we have shown that , in the strongly correlated regime , uhf solutions violating the rotational ( circular ) symmetry arise most naturally in the case of 2d single qd s and for both the cases of zero and high magnetic field.@xcite unlike the case of atomic nuclei , however , where symmetry breaking is associated with quadrupole deformations , spontaneous symmetry breaking in 2d qd s induces electron localization associated with formation of wm s .    the violation in the mean - field approximation of the symmetries of the original many - body hamiltonian appears to be paradoxical at a first glance .",
    "however , for the specific cases arising in nuclear physics and quantum chemistry , two theoretical developments have resolved this paradox .",
    "they are : ( 1 ) the theory of restoration of broken symmetries via projection techniques,@xcite and ( 2 ) the group theoretical analysis of symmetry - broken hf orbitals and solutions in chemical reactions initiated by fukutome and coworkers,@xcite who used of course the symmetry groups associated with the natural 3d molecules . despite the different fields , the general principles established in these earlier theoretical developments have provided a wellspring of assistance in our investigations of symmetry breaking in qd s .",
    "in particular , the restoration of broken circular symmetry in the case of single qd s has already been demonstrated by us in three recent publications.@xcite      in the present paper , we will provide an in - depth group theoretical analysis of broken - symmetry uhf orbitals and electron densities ( ed s ) in the case of single parabolic qd s .",
    "we will show that such an analysis provides further support for our earlier interpretation concerning the spontaneous formation of collectively rotating electron ( or wigner ) molecules ( rem s ) .",
    "indeed we will demonstrate deep analogies between the electronic structure of the wm and that of the natural 3d molecules .",
    "in particular , we will show that the breaking of rotational symmetry results in canonical uhf orbitals that are associated with the eigenvectors of a molecular - type hckel hamiltonian having `` atomic '' sites at positions specified by the equilibrium configuration of the classical @xmath0-electron problem ; these `` atomic '' sites are localization sites for the electrons , and they do not imply the presence of a positive nucleus .",
    "thus , in contrast to the fully delocalized and symmetry - adapted , independent - particle - model - type orbitals of the rhf , the bs uhf orbitals with the _ same spin direction _ resemble closely the molecular orbitals ( mo s ) formed by linear combinations of atomic orbitals ( lcao s ) , which are prevalent@xcite in chemistry .",
    "( naturally , the lcao behavior of the uhf orbitals with the same spin direction allows for a more precise understanding of the term `` electron localization '' used by us in previous publications . )",
    "an important conclusion of the present paper is that the bs uhf orbitals are not necessarily unique ; what matters , in analogy with the lcao - mo s of natural molecules , is that they transform according to the irreducible representations of the point group specified by the discrete symmetries of the classical equilibrium configuration.@xcite    our study leads to the following two main results : ( i ) in analogy with 3d natural molecules , the wm s can rotate and the restoration of the total - spin and rotational symmetries via projection techniques describes their lowest rotational bands ( _ yrast _ bands@xcite ) in addition to the ground state , and ( ii ) the lowering of the symmetry , which results in the ( discrete ) point - group symmetry of the uhf wave function , underlies the appearance of the sequences of magic angular momenta ( familiar from exact - diagonalization studies@xcite ) in the excitation spectra of single qd s . since exact - diagonalization methods",
    "are typically restricted to small sizes with @xmath3 , the present two - step method of breakage and subsequent restoration of symmetries offers a promising new avenue for accurately describing larger 2d electronic systems .",
    "a concrete example of the potential of this approach is provided by ref .   and",
    "ref .   , where our use of the the symmetry - breaking / symmetry - restoration method yielded analytic expressions for correlated wave functions that offer a better description of the @xmath0-electron problem in high magnetic fields compared to the jastrow - laughlin@xcite expression .",
    "since the group - theoretical aspects of symmetry breaking at the mean - field level ( and their relation to the properties of the exact solutions ) remain a vastly unexplored territory in the area of condensed - matter finite - size systems , in the following we will present an introductory investigation of them through a series of rather simple , but nontrivial , illustrative examples from the field of 2d parabolic qd s .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : section ii reviews briefly the set of uhf equations employed by us ; section iii and section iv present the case of three electrons in the absence and in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the more complicated case of six electrons at @xmath4 is investigated in section v , while section vi discusses the companion step of the restoration of broken symmetries , which underlies the appearance of magic angular momenta in the exact spectra .",
    "finally , section vii presents a summary .    before leaving the introduction",
    ", we wish to stress that analogs of several of the group theoretical concepts and manipulations employed in this paper can be found in textbooks concerning standard applications of symmetry groups to the electronic structure and chemistry of 3d natural molecules . here , however , we will use these otherwise well - known group theoretical aspects to elucidate the molecular interpretation of the bs uhf determinants ( and associated orbitals ) in the unexpected context of a newly arising area of physics , namely the physics of strong correlations in 2d circular artificial atoms ( qd s ) .",
    "the uhf equations we are using are the pople - nesbet@xcite equations described in detail in ch . 3.8 of ref .  . for completeness , we present here a brief description of them , along with details of their computational implementation by us to the 2d case of semiconductor qd s .",
    "the key point is that electrons of @xmath5 ( up ) spin are described by one set of spatial orbitals @xmath6 , while electrons of @xmath7 ( down ) spin are described by a different set of spatial orbitals @xmath8 ( of course in the rhf @xmath9 ) .",
    "next , one introduces a set of basis functions @xmath10 ( constructed to be _ orthonormal _ in our 2d case ) , and expands the uhf orbitals as @xmath11 @xmath12    the uhf equations are a system of two coupled matrix eigenvalue problems , @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the fock - operator matrices and @xmath16 are the vectors formed with the coefficients in the expansions ( [ expa ] ) and ( [ expb ] ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath17 are _ diagonal _ , and as a result equations ( [ uhfa ] ) and ( [ uhfb ] ) are _ canonical _ ( standard ) .",
    "notice that noncanonical forms of hf equations are also possible ( see ch .",
    "3.2.2 of ref . ) .",
    "since the selfconsistent iterative solution of the hf equations can be computationally implemented only in their canonical form , heretofore canonical orbitals and solutions will always be implied , unless otherwise noted explicitly .",

    "this polygonal ring structure agrees with the classical one@xcite and is sufficiently complex to instill confidence that the wigner - molecule interpretation is valid .",
    "the following question , however , arises naturally at this point : is such molecular interpretation limited to the intuition provided by the landscapes of the total ed s , or are there deeper analogies with the electronic structure of natural 3d molecules ?",
    "the answer to the second part of this question is in the positive , and the remainder of this paper is devoted to discovering such analogies .",

    "however , overall the bs orbitals ( a@xmath90c ) drastically differ from the orbitals of the independent particle model . in particular ,",
    "they are associated with specific sites ( within the qd ) forming an equilateral triangle , and thus they can be described as having the structure of a linear combination of `` atomic '' ( site ) orbitals ( lcao s ) .",
    "such lcao molecular orbitals ( mo s ) are familiar in natural molecules , and this analogy supports the term `` electron ( or wigner ) molecules '' for characterizing the bs uhf solutions .    in the lcao - mo approximation , one needs to solve a matrix eigenvalue equation determined by the overlaps @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) and the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath93 and @xmath94 between the atomic orbitals .",

    "naturally , since the orbitals ( b ) and ( c ) are degenerate in energy , they are not uniquely defined : any linear combination associated with a unitary @xmath117 transformation will produce a pair of different , but equivalent ( b@xmath118 ) and ( c@xmath118 ) orbitals .",

    "these symmetry operations for the unmarked equilateral triangle constitute the elements of the group @xmath127.@xcite    one of the main applications of group theory in chemistry is the determination of the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation without actually solving the matrix equation ( [ meqn3 ] ) .",

    "this analysis provided further support for our earlier interpretation@xcite concerning the spontaneous formation of collectively rotating electron ( or wigner ) molecules .",
    "indeed the group - theoretical analysis enabled us to unveil further deeper analogies between the electronic structure of the wigner molecules and that of the natural 3d molecules .",
    "in particular these deeper analogies are : ( i ) the breaking of rotational symmetry results in canonical uhf orbitals that are associated with the eigenvectors of a molecular - type hckel hamiltonian with sites at positions specified by the equilibrium configuration of the classical @xmath0-electron problem ; ( ii ) the broken - symmetry canonical uhf orbitals transform according to the irreducible representations of the point group specified by the discrete symmetries of this classical molecular configuration ; ( iii ) the wm s formed out of the broken - symmetry uhf solutions can rotate , and the restoration of the total - spin and rotational symmetries results ( in addition to the ground state ) in states defining the lowest rotational bands ( i.e. , yrast bands ) of the wm s ; ( iv ) the breaking of the circular symmetry results in lowering of the symmetry .",
    "this is expressed by the discrete point - group symmetry of the uhf wave function and it underlies the appearance of sequences of magic angular momenta ( familiar from exact - diagonalization studies ) in the excitation spectra of single qd s .",
