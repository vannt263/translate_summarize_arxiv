    "this type of statistical description , however , is not fully justified according to the present understanding about thermodynamics of systems with long - range interactions , astrophysical systems in particular .",
    "originally , these theoretical frameworks were developed to deal with the macroscopic description of systems of everyday applications , which are composed of a very large number of constituents that interact among them by means of short - range interactions .",
    "for these systems , it is possible to speak about separability , additivity , extensivity and other macroscopic properties that support the licitness of conventional statistical ensembles .",

    "mathematically , this container is described here by the external potential field : @xmath217 for comparison purposes , the caloric curve and the pressure of this second model are shown in figure [ antonov.eps ] when the container boundary @xmath218 is a sphere @xmath219 of radius @xmath17 .",
    "this model system asymptotically behaves as an ideal gas for very large energies , which means that particles distribution is _ rigorously homogeneous _ in the limit @xmath220 only .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ sgg ] ) of antonov isothermal model does not obey the invariance under translations , and therefore , particles distribution is rigorously nonhomogeneous for any finite energy .",
    "in contrast , hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) of our model system is invariant under @xmath2 rotations , which is the reason why the particles distribution can be homogeneous when the dimensionless energy @xmath221 .     (",
    "energy ) , @xmath167 ( temperature ) and @xmath222 ( pressure ) .",
    "the notable points of caloric curve @xmath223.@xmath224 and @xmath225.@xmath226 correspond to critical points of gravothermal and isothermal collapses .",
    "the branch @xmath227 ( red line ) are configurations with negative heat capacities .",
    "the microcanonical pressure exhibits a third notable point @xmath228.@xmath229 where the dimensionless pressure variable @xmath137 over exhibits its minimal value @xmath230.@xmath231.,title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] +    the incidence of gravitation turns more and more important when the total energy of the system decreases .",
    "the predominance of gravitation leads to the existence of states with negative heat capacities for energies @xmath232 , where @xmath233.@xmath234 and @xmath235.@xmath236 .",
    "according to virial relation ( [ virial ] ) , states with negatives heat capacities can appear when the absolute values of surface tension @xmath137 are sufficiently small .",
    "the notable point @xmath237 is a local minima of the microcanonical caloric curve , which corresponds to the critical point of called _ isothermal collapse_. in general , this gravitational instability is not relevant for real astrophysical situations since it requires the _ thermal contact _ with a heat bath with infinite heat capacity .",
    "the usage of this argument is very usual in conventional extensive systems of everyday practice ( systems with short - range interactions ) that are under thermodynamic influence of the natural environment .",
    "however , astrophysical systems are driven by gravitation , which is a long - range interaction .",
    "in general , the consideration of a thermal contact with a heat bath is not a licit argument in presence of long - range interactions .",
    "the interaction among astrophysical systems always involves each one of these systems as a whole , which contrasts with the _ effective surface character _ of the interactions associated with thermal contact in conventional applications @xcite .",
    "moreover , the canonical description ( associated with the thermal contact of our system ) is nonequivalent to microcanonical description discussed here .",
    "the microcanonical caloric curves of figure [ todo.eps ] exhibit several values of dimensionless energy @xmath166 when the values of dimensionless temperature @xmath167 belongs to the interval @xmath238 .",
    "ensemble inequivalence arises here because of there is no one - to - one ( bijective ) correspondence between these thermodynamic variables .",
    "in fact , configurations with negative heat capacities that belong to the energy interval @xmath239 are non - accessible within canonical description .    according to dependencies shown in figure [ todo.eps].d ,",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of our model system is almost independent on the number of partitions @xmath112 for energies @xmath240 .",
    "however , a very different situation is observed for lower energies .",
    "microcanonical caloric curve for @xmath241 exhibits a change of monotony at the notable energy @xmath242 rather similar to the one observed at the critical energy @xmath214 , while the magnetization order parameter @xmath203 exhibits a local maximum ( see in figure [ todo.eps].a ) . on the contrary",
    ", one observes a _ discontinuous jump _ in dimensionless temperature dependence for the case @xmath209 .",
    "consequently , the notable point @xmath242 corresponds to the occurrence of a second clustering phase transition of our model system , whose character continuous or discontinuous crucially depends on the number of partitions @xmath112 : it is _ continuous _ when the values of @xmath112 are low enough ( as the case @xmath241 ) , while it turns _ discontinuous _ for @xmath112 sufficiently large ( as the case @xmath209 ) .",
    "all these thermodynamic dependencies exhibit two stable branches that are denoted here by the letters @xmath243 ( low energy behavior ) and @xmath244 ( high energy behavior ) .",
    "this second microcanonical phase transition represents a special form of gravitational clustering : the called _ gravitational collapse _ , where one observes the formation of a very _ dense core _ in the inner regions of the system ( see in figure [ profiles.eps].d ) .",
    "this is the called _ gravothermal catastrophe _ of the antonov isothermal model @xcite , which takes place at the notable point @xmath245 as shown in figure [ antonov.eps ] .",
    "gravothermal collapse is a thermodynamic instability that arises when the internal pressure of the self - gravitating gas ( or its surface tension @xmath137 in our case ) is unable to compensate the incidence of its own gravitational forces .",
    "as expected , the stable branch @xmath243 with low energies describes the system thermodynamic behavior for post - collapse configurations .",
    "+    at first glance , dependence of the low energy thermodynamic behavior on the number of partitions @xmath112 can be regarded as an artificial result of our computational study , overall , since @xmath112 is merely a parameter of finite element methods employed for the computational study of the self - consistent problem ( [ phi.matrix])-([beta.disc ] ) .",
    "however , the number of partitions @xmath112 formally defines the minimum volume @xmath246 to be occupied by the self - gravitating gas , a constraint that acts here as a _ regularization prescription _ for the short - range divergence of the gravitational interaction ( [ interact.w ] ) when particles separation @xmath247 .",
    "previously , we have assumed that particles distribution are homogeneous inside each partition of the sphere @xmath9 , which is formally equivalent to impose that the particles that are located inside a same partition are _ non - interacting_. a more rigorous mathematical treatment to implement this prescription is to regularize the gravitational potential ( [ interact.w ] ) by introducing a small cutoff length @xmath248 as follows : @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the separation between the particles .",
    "heuristically , the cutoff length @xmath248 and the number of partitions @xmath112 could be related as @xmath251 .",
    "this type of prescription enables the system to find a new branch of thermodynamic stability after the occurrence gravitational collapse .",
    "notice that the post - collapse branch @xmath243 is not present in the microcanonical caloric curve of antonov isothermal model shown in figure [ antonov.eps ] .",
    "in other words , the incidence of gravitation alone is unable to explain the existence of the post - collapse configurations , that is , additional physical considerations are required to describe interactions among the particles at very small distances .",
    "the argument considered in the present study is just a particular example . as already discussed by chavanis @xcite ,",
    "other astrophysical models include the incidence of quantum effects ( e.g. : pauli exclusion principle ) or the consideration of hard - core ( soft - core ) particles with finite size .",
    "for example , it is usual in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations to employ the following short - range regularization of newtonian interaction potential : @xmath252 between two particles with mass @xmath253 with a separation distance @xmath254 .",
    "the length scale @xmath248 describes the existence of the _ internal structure _ for each constituting particle ( a soft core ) . for separation distances",
    "sufficiently large , this mathematical form of regularized potential can be obtained if each constituting particle obeys the density profile of the known plummer model @xcite : @xmath255 according to the present analysis , the collapsed structures resulting from these dynamical simulations necessarily depend on this type of short - range regularization .    according to dependencies shown in figure [ todo.eps].d , there exists an energy interval where both stable branches are overlapped for @xmath209 .",
    "specifically , one observes the existence of two different stable states for a same value of the dimensionless energy @xmath207 within the interval @xmath256 .",
    "the end points of these branches have been labeled as @xmath257 ( end point of branch b ) and @xmath258 ( end point of branch a ) .",
    "this coexistence of stable configurations evidences that the transition between the stable branches can occur in any energy of this interval .",
    "in fact , one should observe the occurrence of _ metastability _ : a tendency of the system to remain trapped in a certain ( metastable ) configuration despite the other configuration exhibits a major occurrence probability ( or a larger entropy ) .",
    "imagine that our model system is firstly subjected to a process when its internal energy is increased , and afterwards , the same one is subjected to a second process where its internal energy is decreased . since the transition from a stable branch to the other does not necessarily take place a the same energy point , one should observed a sort of _ hysteresis phenomenon_. this experiment was indeed developed in our computational study , whose results are reported in figure [ hysteresis.eps ] . for a better understanding",
    ", we have included here the number of iterations @xmath259 considered to reach the convergence of calculations .",
    "as expected , the number of iteration exhibit a considerable increasing in the vicinity of the two microcanonical phase transitions .",
    "however , the slow relaxation is more severe for the case of discontinuous microcanonical phase transition for @xmath209 .",
    "moreover , the transition from a branch to the other ones does not occur at the same energy point if simulations are performed increasing the total energy , and alternatively , by decreasing the energy .",
    "the second clustering phase transition is located inside the energy region @xmath260 with negative heat capacities .",
    "the mere presence of these states reveals that our astrophysical system is nonhomogeneous .",
    "however , this behavior does not imply the coexistence of stable configurations for a same value of energy . as already emphasized ,",
    "the coexistence of stable configurations ( pre and post - collapse phases ) is observed within the subset @xmath256 of this last interval when this transition is discontinuous .",
    "the great difference among configurations that belong from different branch reveals that the transition between these branches should be a violent process . according to distribution profiles shown in figures [ profiles.eps].c and [ profiles.eps].d ,",
    "such a reconfiguration of particles distribution involves a great _ mass displacing _ from the intermediate regions towards the inner and the outer regions , which leads to the formation of a very dense core and a more dense halo .",
    "this mass displacing explains the observed behavior of order parameters shown in figure [ orden.eps ] .",
    "in particular , the mass displacing towards the outer regions explains the decreasing of the magnetization order parameter @xmath203 , while the mass displacing towards the inner regions explains the growth of the absolute value of total potential energy @xmath161 ( this behavior is better illustrated in the inset of figure [ orden.eps].c ) .",
    "the progressive reduction of the system energy provokes a continuous mass displacing from the halo towards the core ( see in figure [ profiles.eps].b ) .",
    "the occupation of the minimum volume practically occurs at point @xmath261 , where the order parameter @xmath203 exhibits its maximum value close to the unity ( see in fig.[orden.eps ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , the total potential energy @xmath161 reaches its minimum value @xmath262 , which depends on the number if partitions @xmath112 . however , dimensionless temperature @xmath263 at the notable energy @xmath261 is non - zero .",
    "as clearly evidenced in figure [ todo.eps ] ( as well as figures [ lecuaes.eps].c and [ lecuaes.eps].c ) , the self - gravitating gas recovers the ideal gas behavior for the energy interval @xmath264 , that is , a linear dependence between temperature and energy , as well as the surface tension @xmath137 and temperature . however , there is something different in this case : the extreme gravitational clustering of the self - gravitating gas produces _ negative values _ in the surface tension @xmath137 ( see in figure [ lecuaes.eps ] ) .",
    "thermodynamic behavior associated with the present model is in fully agreement with the qualitative picture discussed by padmanabhan @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the long and short - range divergences of thermo - statistics of @xmath0-body gravitational problem in @xmath10 were successfully avoided in our thermo - statistical study due to the consideration of long - range and short - range cutoffs @xmath17 and @xmath265 , which are respectively related to the radius of the sphere @xmath9 and its partition into a finite number @xmath112 of cells . moreover ,",
    "the two clustering phase transitions reported here were anticipated by klissing in a recent study for the case of sphere @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "other related study is the called _ self - gravitating ring model _ @xcite , which is 1d model defined on the sphere @xmath266 .",
    "this toy model predicts behaviors quite similar to the model discussed by padmanabhan , although it differs from the one discussed in this work for intermediate energies .",
    "despite its simplicity , the present model captures some aspects concerning to the formation of large astrophysical structures .",
    "the same one predicts that gravitational clustering can be associated with two microcanonical phase transitions .",
    "the formation of compact astrophysical structures is a collective behavior that is preceded by a gravitational clustering that involves a breakdown of homogeneity of particles distribution on the sphere @xmath9 . by itself",
    ", this picture suggests a hierarchical structuring : i ) a first clustering phase transition drives the formation of distribution profiles with a larger linear dimensions , e.g. : a cloud or a nebulae , and ii ) a second type of clustering phase transition , the gravitational collapse , leads to the formation of more compact structures with lower linear dimensions , that is , a very dense core ( see in figure [ profiles.eps].d ) .",
    "moreover , this model describes that the formation of a very dense core during gravitational collapse is accompanied with a significant _ mass displacing _ towards the outer regions ( see in figure [ profiles.eps].c ) and the _ gravitational heating _ of the whole astrophysical structure ( see in figure [ todo.eps ] ) .",
    "this mass displacing is indeed observed during gravitational collapse of a star , which is essentially non - equilibrium processes ( due to the shock - wave that follows after the core - collapse ) .",
    "the present approach provides an alternative description to this process despite it explicitly invokes equilibrium , which evidences the power of the thermo - statistical description to deal with astrophysical situations .",
    "let us now refer to more subtle implications of our model , such as the proper influence of gravitational clustering on the equation of state of the matter in the universe . according to relation ( [ state.equation ] ) ,",
    "once the gravitational clustering breaks the homogeneity of matter distribution , a negative gravitational contribution to the pressure naturally appears .",
    "thermodynamically speaking , this modification of the ideal gas equation of state @xmath267 is fully analogous to the one considered by van der waals equation of state @xcite : @xmath268 where coefficients @xmath269 account for the incidence of attractive and repulsive intermolecular forces , respectively .",
    "while local inhomogeneities of matter distribution justifies the existence of this modification , the same one is systematically disregarded in most of approaches about the universe expansion . for example , a typical assumption is that the equation of state that relates energy density @xmath207 and pressure @xmath145 in the stress - energy tensor for a perfect fluid @xcite : @xmath270 is fully determined by its proper microscopic nature in absence of gravitation , e.g. : the electromagnetic radiation obeys the relation @xmath271 or the non - relativistic degenerate gas @xmath272 .",
    "apparently , the incidence of gravitation and their associated local heterogeneities seems to justify a modification of local surface tension @xmath273 of the self - gravitating gas as follows : @xmath274 here , @xmath11 is the gravitational potential , while @xmath275 and @xmath13 the densities of particles and mass , respectively .",
    "note that expression ( [ local.eos ] ) can be heuristically inferred from the equation of state ( [ state.equation ] ) .",
    "this result is obtained from ( [ local.eos ] ) after integrating over the volume @xmath276 of the sphere @xmath9 and replacing the local surface tension @xmath277 by its average value @xmath137 .",
    "once gravitational collapse occurs , the gravitational contribution to the state equation turns dominant and explains the arising of negative pressures ( or negative surface tension ) .",
    "curiously , the existence of a fluid with a negative pressure is described by the @xmath8-term of einstein field equation : @xmath278 the called dark energy contribution @xcite . in the context of the evolutionary dynamics of the universe",
    ", such a negative pressure explains an accelerated expansion .",
    "although the influence of the local inhomogeneities over the large scale structure is usually neglected in cosmology @xcite , recent theoretical studies have suggested that they mimic effects usually attributed to cosmic acceleration from dark energy @xcite .",
    "the present result is compatible with this type of arguments .",
    "a non - satisfactory aspect of the previous analysis is that gravitational clustering produces a single cluster , while a more realistic description should include the formation of multiple clusters and other more complex structures .",
    "obvious limitations are the usage of steepest descend method and the simplifying assumption ( [ azimuthal.sym ] ) considered in our computational procedure . a simple way to improve",
    "the present study is to replace the application of steepest descend and continuum approximation by a direct @xmath0-body monte carlo estimation of integral ( [ ne1 ] ) .",
    "this type of approach enables the study of strong correlation effects , e.g. : , the calculation of two - point correlations function @xmath279 , which is of great interest in the study of large - scale distribution of matter @xcite .",
    "the formation of multiple clusters and other structures could be favored by considering additional realistic ingredients .",
    "for example , the radius @xmath17 of sphere @xmath9 is regarded here as a fixed parameter , while this quantity should be considered as a _ dynamical variable_. this type of peculiarity can be addressed by generalizing hamiltonian model ( [ hamilton ] ) as follows : @xmath280 where positions and momenta @xmath281 are now referred to the unitary sphere @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the variable @xmath112 represents the momentum that is conjugated to the radius @xmath17 , while the potential @xmath282 can be employed to introduce other dynamical effects .",
    "this type of description introduces _ effective dynamical friction _ in the microscopic dynamics of the self - gravitating gas .",
    "other interesting ingredient is the _ coalescence _ of system constituents .",
    "certainly , the inclusion of these ingredients demands a more sophisticated thermo - statistical treatment , but they enable a theoretical analysis of some other interesting questions .",
    "for example , coalescence is the basic mechanism for the appearance of a mass spectrum for the constituents of the self - gravitating gas , while the incidence of effective friction associated with dynamical expansion of radius @xmath17 triggers the formation of _ dissipative structures _ @xcite .",
    "the above ingredients are actually considered in @xmath0-body cosmological simulations @xcite , which are able to reproduce some features of large - scale distribution of galaxies reported by observations .",
    "other challenge for future works is the consideration of relativistic treatment of gravitation of the present thermo - statistics of @xmath0-body problem .",
    "as already shown , the microcanonical description requires consideration of the total energy and other integral of motions .",
    "however , the question of conservation laws involves some subtle difficulties in general relativity theory , such as inequivalence between their local and integral forms . a way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is the introduction of _ pseudo - tensors _ for conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "while mathematical apparatus of general relativity presupposes an equivalent treatment for physical laws in all coordinate systems , one faces a different situation when conservation laws are described with pseudo - tensors : they leads to some mistaking artifacts of a particular coordinate system for real physical effects .",
    "fortunately , energy conservation works out in the case of _ static spacetime _ associated with an isolated @xmath0-body system in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "other possible treatment is the foliation of spacetime described by _",
    "adm formalism _",
    "@xcite , which enables the development of equations of motion for general relativity in the form of hamilton s equations .",
    "in fact , these ideas have been exploited in the past to perform statistical - mechanic calculations in general relativity in the framework of microcanonical ensemble @xcite , specifically , for studies concerning to black hole thermodynamics . in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "the consideration of gravitational energy is crucial for conservation of total energy .",
    "precisely , this feature is responsible at the macroscopic level of the gravitational modification to equation of state ( [ state.equation ] ) .",
    "it is quite interesting analyze to clarify whether or not this non - relativistic effect appears in general relativity .",
