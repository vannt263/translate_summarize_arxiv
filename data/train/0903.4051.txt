    "roughly speaking , model theory studies first - order theories and the corresponding classes of their models ( i.e. , elementary classes ) . properties of the first - order theory of a structure can then give direct insight into the structure itself .",
    "investigation thereof was classically restricted to so - called `` algebraic '' structures , such as fields , groups , and graphs .",
    "additionally , in modern model theory one often studies _ stable _ theories  theories whose models admit a `` well - behaved '' notion of independence ( which , if it exists , is always unique ) .",
    "_ continuous first - order logic _ was developed in @xcite as an extension of classical first - order logic , permitting one to broaden the aforementioned classical analysis of algebraic structures to various natural classes of complete metric structures .",
    "( it should be pointed out that classes of complete metric structures can not be elementary in the classical sense for several reasons .",
    "for example , completeness is an infinitary property and is therefore not expressible in classical first - order logic .",
    "see also @xcite for a general survey of continuous logic and its applications for various kinds of metric structures arising in functional analysis and probability theory . ) for example , the class ( of unit balls ) of hilbert spaces and the class of probability algebras are elementary in this sense .",
    "( a probability algebra is the boolean algebra of events of a probability space modulo the null measure ideal , with the metric @xmath8 . ) furthermore , the classical notion of stability can easily be extended to continuous first - order logic .",
    "indeed , somewhat unsurprisingly , the classes of hilbert spaces and probability algebras are stable , independence being orthogonality and probabilistic independence , respectively .",
    "historically , two groups of logics precede continuous first - order logic . on the one hand ,",
    "continuous first - order logic has _ structural _ precursors .",
    "the structural precursors are those logics which make use of machinery similar to that of continuous first - order logic yet were never developed to study complete metric structures .",
    "such structural precursors include chang and keisler s continuous logic @xcite , ukasiewicz s many - valued logic @xcite , and pavelka s many - valued logic @xcite .",
    "chang and keisler s logic is much too general for the study of complete metric structures , while ukasiewicz logic and pavelka s logic were developed for different purposes .",
    "nonetheless , continuous first - order logic is an improved variant of chang and keisler s logic . on the other hand",
    ", continuous first - order logic has _ purposive _ precursors .",
    "the purposive precursors are those logics which were developed to study complete metric structures yet do not make use of machinery similar to that of continuous first - order logic .",
    "the purposive precursors of continuous first - order logic include henson s logic for banach structures @xcite and compact abstract theories ( `` cats '' ) @xcite .",
    "continuous first - order logic does not suffer from several shortcomings of these logics .",
    "importantly , continuous first - order logic is less technically involved than the previous logics and in many respects much closer to classical first - order logic . still , continuous first - order logic is expressively equivalent to the logic of metric open hausdorff cats .",
    "continuous first - order logic also generalizes henson s logic for banach structures , and as such , is expressively equivalent to a natural variant of henson s logic .    as an extension of classical first - order logic ,",
    "continuous first - order logic satisfies suitably phrased forms of the compactness theorem , the lwenheim - skolem theorems , the diagram arguments , craig s interpolation theorem , beth s definability theorem , characterizations of quantifier elimination and model completeness , the existence of saturated and homogeneous models results , the omitting types theorem , fundamental results of stability theory , and nearly all other results of elementary model theory . moreover",
    ", continuous first - order logic affords a tractable framework for ultraproduct constructions ( and so hull constructions ) in applications of model theory in analysis and geometry .",
    "in fact , expressing conditions from analysis and geometry feels quite natural in continuous first - order logic , furnishing model theorists and analysts with a common language .",
    "thus it is clear that continuous first - order logic is of interest to model theorists . yet with research focused on the model theory of continuous first - order logic and thus semantic features of this framework , a natural question seems to lurk in the background : is there an interesting set of axioms yielding a completeness result ?",
    "the answer depends on how one formulates the notion of completeness . to be sure",
    ", there is an interesting set of axioms , and , as we will see , a set of formulae is ( completely ) satisfiable if ( and only if ) it is consistent .",
    "however , as for continuous propositional logic , only an _ approximated _ form of strong completeness is obtainable . by this",
    "we mean that @xmath0 only if @xmath1 for all @xmath2 , which amounts to the idea if @xmath0 , then proofs from @xmath3 , being finite , can provide arbitrarily better approximations of the truth of @xmath4 .",
    "( what _ this _ means will become clearer below . )",
    "this should hardly be surprising in light of the fact that continuous first - order logic has been developed for complete metric structures equipped with uniformly continuous functions with respect to which formulae take truth values anywhere in @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "of course , a different kind of question traditionally arising in model theory is that of decidability : when is the set of all consequences of a theory ( in a countable , recursive language ) recursive ?",
    "again , such questions can be extended to continuous first - order logic .",
    "say that a complete theory @xmath5 is _ decidable _ if for every sentence @xmath4 , the value @xmath6 is a recursive real , and moreover , uniformly computable from @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 is incomplete , we say it is decidable if for every sentence @xmath4 the real number @xmath7 is uniformly recursive from @xmath4 , where @xmath7 is the maximal value of @xmath4 consistent with @xmath5 .",
    "( see definition [ defn : deg ] .",
    "if @xmath5 is complete , then @xmath4 takes the same value in all models of @xmath5 , so @xmath10 coincides with @xmath7 and therefore @xmath7 is the unique value of @xmath4 consistent with @xmath5 . ) as in classical first - order logic , it follows from the completeness theorem that if a complete theory admits a recursive ( or even recursively enumerable ) axiomatization then it is decidable , whence the connection to the present paper .    following an introduction to ukasiewicz propositional logic and continuous propositional logic ,",
    "we offer a definition of the language of continuous first - order logic and then supply a precise formulation of its semantics .",
    "indeed , this paper can also be seen as an effort to precisely organize and unify the various presentations of continuous first - order logic found in the literature which are often intimated in a rough - and - ready form .",
    "finally , we state and usually prove various results needed to reach the goal of this paper : to state and prove the completeness theorem for continuous first - order logic .",
    "to follow our intuitions to this end , the structure of our approach is largely borrowed from the classical approach employed to prove the completeness theorem . in particular , we make use of a henkin - like construction and a weakened version of the deduction theorem of classical first - order logic .",
    "moreover , various definitions and results found in the classical approach are translated to play analogous roles in our development , while from @xcite we take some basic facts and definitions peculiar to continuous first - order logic .",
    "it will become apparent , however , that our approach differs from the classical one in many respects .",
    "furthermore , the completeness theorem we offer is formulated with respect to the semantics employed by the model theorist who studies continuous first - order logic . in particular",
    ", our work does not exploit an algebraic semantics .",
    "finally , we should note that results of research on the interplay between logical and deductive entailment for both continuous propositional logic and ukasiewicz propositional logic play a crucial role in getting our feet off the ground so that we may follow our intuitions in the first place @xcite .",
    "( this work of the first author is partially based on the results of work done by chang @xcite and rose and rosser @xcite on ukasiewicz logic . ) with this , we set out to the task at hand .",
