    "high peak - power laser pulses are sought in diverse scientific and technological applications such as biomedical imaging @xcite , ultrafast spectroscopy @xcite , and high harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "ultrashort laser pulses in the picosecond to femtosecond range are routinely produced by the technique of mode locking , where the axial modes of the cavity are locked in phase to produce a train of pulses with a repetition rate @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the speed of light and @xmath6 is the effective optical path length of the resonator @xcite .",
    "pulse energies directly generated from such lasers are typically in the nj range and amplification schemes are necessary in order to scale up the peak intensities to levels where nonlinear interactions can be observed .",
    "recently , a simple amplification method was demonstrated , based on the extension of the standard mode - locked resonator length with a compact multipass cavity @xcite .",
    "if the added insertion loss of the extended cavity is negligible , the average output power of the laser remains nearly the same and extension of the cavity length scales up the energy per pulse by lowering the repetition rate .",
    "while this technique has been widely used to amplify femtosecond pulses up to @xmath3j energies @xcite , there is an ever growing need to find amplification methods that will facilitate the construction of even more compact , high - intensity lasers .",
    "about five years ago , we proposed a compact laser pulse amplification scheme using two bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) introduced in the resonator of a mode - locked laser @xcite .",
    "the basic idea was to utilize the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) scheme @xcite in a cavity @xcite to make the pulse ultraslow @xcite such that the effective pulse repetition rate could be drastically reduced due to the increase of the cavity round - trip time , provided that the average output power of the laser remains nearly the same after the introduction of the condensates , this increase in round - trip time then scales up the output energy .",
    "the promise of laser pulse amplification by atomic condensates is further studied by taking into account atom - atom interactions in f - deformed condensate formalism very recently @xcite .",
    "it is found that interactions make the amplification effect stronger .",
    "moreover , in addition to subluminal propagation , possibility of superluminal speeds and high degree of control over the repetition rate are also shown to be possible .",
    "on the other hand , neither of these works consider the effects of the heating of the condensates due to optical pulse absorption .",
    "present work is a critical evaluation of the feasibility of the proposal by taking into account the temperature increase of the condensates during pulse propagation .    in the design of a practical bec pulse amplifier ,",
    "certain effects need to be further considered .",
    "first , because the bec would introduce an excessive amount of dispersion to short pulses @xcite , undesirable pulse broadening results . to overcome this limitation , we offer a method for dispersion compensation by using a second intracavity bec with the proper choice of energy levels to provide the opposite sign of dispersion .",
    "second bec can be in fact prepared identical with the first , and a magnetic field can be utilized to shift the energy levels of the second bec to match the desired detuning of the probe pulse .",
    "second , the transparency bandwidth of the eit process puts a limitation on the shortest temporal pulsewidth that can be amplified in the resonator . resulting bandwidth limitation of the amplifier",
    "is further discussed .",
    "our results show that , pulse energy amplification factors of @xmath1 are possible by using a @xmath7na bec with effective lengths of @xmath8 m .",
    "finally , heating of the condensate , due to small but nonzero absorption in the eit scheme , introduces an operational time beyond which the condensate turns into usual maxwell - boltzmann gas .",
    "our calculations reveal a critical time , @xmath0 ms , at which the amplification factor is optimum .",
    "the significance of proposed method of effectively increasing the length of the cavity against the straightforward solution of extended cavities should be clarified .",
    "in fact it is of high demand to have compact laser cavities in practical laser systems . in applications like optical data storage , filtering or other optical logic and signal processing , having long optical paths , for long optical delay , while maintaining cavity volume small brings tremendous practical advantages .",
    "the search for such compact cavities goes back to mid 1960s .",
    "herriott et al .",
    "introduced the method of folding long optical paths for compact cavities @xcite .",
    "around early 2000 , multi - pass cavities were developed by cho et al @xcite .",
    "this is now an active modern research field ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) . in ultraslow light scheme by electromagnetically",
    "induced transparency , optical pulses slow down to speeds about few meters / second .",
    "thus the effective optical path is indeed too long for considering an equivalent extended cavity .",
    "in addition to the typical applications of compact laser cavities in accurate optical loss measurements , stimulated raman scattering , long - path absorption spectroscopy , high - speed path - length scanning , present system of ultraslow light has another crucial application area of coherent optical memory . with modest amplification power and dispersion compensation , proposed scheme",
    "can also be used for that purpose in the context of correcting pulse shape errors in the stored optical information .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in the eit configuration , a condition of weak probe is usually assumed , such that , a strong drive field with rabi frequency @xmath9 and the circulating resonator field of frequency @xmath10 satisfy @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a conventional configuration is the case where the probe field is pulsed while the drive field is continuous wave ( cw ) @xcite .",
    "studies and experiments in the strong probe regime indicate deterioration of eit and enhanced absorption of the probe pulse @xcite .",
    "requirements for initiation of eit is formulated in terms of rabi frequencies @xcite .",
    "we are assuming that rabi frequency of the amplified pulsed signal remains sufficiently smaller than the rabi frequency of the cw drive so that the eit conditions are maintained during the operation .",
    "our results reveal a maximum of amplification factor and the strength of the cw control field can be chosen accordingly.though we did not specifically investigate it here , our scheme may also be used for compensating enhanced absorption in the strong probe eit experiments",
    ". this would be particularly advantageous to examine interactions of probe and coupling fields @xcite , adiabatons @xcite , as well as to facilitate nonlinear processes demanded for eit applications @xcite .    under the weak probe condition , susceptibility @xmath12 for the probe transition",

    "is neglected .    at the probe resonance ,",
    "imaginary part of @xmath12 becomes negligible and results in turning an optically opaque medium transparent .",
    "furthermore , eit can be used to achieve ultra - slow light velocities , owing to the steep dispersion of the eit susceptibility @xmath12 about the probe resonance @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the proposed bec pulse amplifier is shown in fig .",
    "the short cavity , initially extending from the output coupler ( oc ) up to the end high reflector ( hr@xmath26 ) , contains a gain medium and is first passively mode - locked by using the technique of kerr lens mode locking or a saturable absorber @xcite .",
    "the cavity is then extended by removing hr@xmath26 and two different becs are introduced inside the resonator which now extends from oc up to the end high reflector hr@xmath27 .",
    "although there is some interest to examine josephson coupled becs in optical cavities @xcite , here we assume the becs are spatially disconnected , such that the condensates are kept in traps which are sufficiently far apart from each other to avoid spatial overlap of condensate wave functions .",
    "as long as there is josephson coupling then condensate numbers would have dynamics and our treatment with frozen density profile can not be applied.in addition to josephson effect one could consider dense condensates with interaction terms and dissipation effects to find equilibrium density profiles so that our treatment can be extended to such a case to determine electric susceptibility for calculating possibility of dispersion compensation and reduction of group velocity .",
    "the becs are in the eit configuration used in ultraslow light experiments @xcite .",
    "the circulating laser pulse acts as the probe field in the becs and external coupling lasers are used to achieve transparency .",
    "bec1 introduces delay to lower the repetition rate while the bec2 acts as a dispersion compensator .",
    "additional delay is also produced by bec2 .",
    "axial sizes of the becs are assumed to be sufficiently shorter than the cavity length while we have assumed that proper focusing optics is employed to keep the spotsize within the extent of the bec , so that the original mode structure was preserved .",
    "recent experiments with becs in optical cavities @xcite are successfully modeled under the assumption of frozen spatial mode profile of the cavity .",

    ", we find @xmath66.,width=312 ]    at the same but red detuning , dispersion would be almost the same , but with the opposite sign . for propagation through a single bec ,",
    "this sign change is not relevant on pulse broadening . on the other hand , by introducing a second bec , plays a role through the pulse chirp .",
    "the pulses emerging from bec1 are broadened and chirped . in other words ,",
    "the instantaneous carrier frequency differs across the temporal pulse profile from the central carrier frequency . in the presence of second - order group velocity dispersion ,",
    "this chirp is approximately linear near the pulse center .",
    "if the chirped pulse then enters the second bec whose group velocity dispersion parameter is adjusted to be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of bec1 , the linear chirp near the pulse center will be cancelled and the initial pulsewidth will be restored ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) . for that aim , we assume that bec2 is also in an eit configuration but energy levels for the probe transition are shifted by an external magnetic field . hence the blue detuned probe for bec1 would be red detuned for bec2 by the same amount . as the dispersions are of the same magnitude but of opposite sign , this can be used to compensate for the positive dispersion of the delay segment ( bec1 ) , provided that the dispersion introduced in the other intracavity elements are negligible .    to determine the operating point of the amplifier , we adjust the parameters of the becs so that @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the operating point would be independent of temperature for identical condensates as @xmath54 are proportional to the @xmath69 that are the same for both becs .",

    "we find that dispersion compensation condition , @xmath71 , is satisfied by @xmath72 at @xmath73 which will be the operating point of the amplifier .",
    "we assumed identical traps and condensates only for the sake for simplicity .",
    "the main formalism and the dispersion compensation condition @xmath74 is generally valid for non - identical traps and condensates .",
    "the effect of different number of atoms in the becs would be on the operating point ( detuning of the probe field ) where the dispersion compensation is achieved .",
    "we can make a simple estimate .",
    "dispersion coefficient is proportional to the product of bec density and length , both of which are related to the chemical potential by power laws .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath75 is related to the ratio of the chemical potentials of the becs .",
    "assuming thomas - fermi profiles , @xmath75 has negligibly weak temperature dependence , but strong dependence on the ratio of condensed particle numbers @xmath76 . if we know @xmath77 and @xmath78 then the operating point can be determined by simple calculation .",
    "due to number fluctuations the compensation of the dispersion would be incomplete .",
    "however , the amplification factors are modest in our case and the pulse duration is in the order of microseconds . for such pulses",
    "the dispersion is not too strong and even partial compensation of dispersion should be sufficient and thus we can say fluctuation of particle number would not have crucial effects on our conclusions .",
    "the heating rate of a gaseous sample due to optical absorption is a standard problem in laser cooling theory ( see e.g. @xcite ( chapter 4 ) ) . the rate of change in the average kinetic energy of an atom due to absorption can be evaluated from @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the recoil velocity of the atom with mass @xmath81 due to absorption of a laser photon at wave number @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the radiation force acting on the atom .",
    "impulse - momentum theorem can be written for the absorption as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the characteristic time of interaction between the atom and the radiation field .",

    "the effect of dynamically changing temperature @xmath110 is to make the density of the cloud time dependent .",
    "we shall use semi - ideal model of the bec @xcite for an analytical expression of the density of the atomic cloud .",
    "indeed the main dissipation channel is the loss of the condensate atoms .",
    "in addition to heating , other mechanisms of condensed particle loss may occur , such as three - body loss @xcite .",
    "here we do not take them into account as we assume becs are sufficiently dilute , and the number of particles are not too large . thus in our case",
    "the only source of particle loss out of the condensate is heating , or the recoil momentum transfer , by pulse absorption .",
    "atoms with sufficient recoil are thermalized and removed from the condensate phase .",
    "this in turn reduces the density of the condensate .",
    "once the density becomes lower than the critical density required to maintain the condensate , then the condensate is destroyed and the gas is entirely thermalized .",
    "the semi - classical model we employ is in fact is to treat such a case .",
    "it contains both the thermal and condensate phases . below",
    "the critical temperature thermal phase serves as the thermal background for the dominant condensate phase .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency has normally negligible absorption but still it is not zero .",
    "single pulse would transfer a little energy to the condensate .",
    "duration of the interaction due to pulse delay is less than the timeneeded to transfer sufficient energy to destroy the condensate .",
    "the recoil energy or the received kinetic energy is translated in our treatment to the temperature variable .",
    "temperature and time has linear relation .",
    "the loss of the atoms out of the condensate phase or the condensate fraction reduces by the temperature .",
    "these arguments can be put into mathematical context using the semi - ideal model as follows .    the total density at a temperature @xmath111 is then written to be @xmath112 where @xmath113",

    "the optical pulse would heat the cloud to @xmath120 in @xmath122s .",
    "the maximum pulse delay time @xmath123s is less than the the critical time at which the condensate turns into thermal gas .",
    "however , as the multiple passes of the pulse train over the condensate continue to heat it we shall consider time , and corresponding temperature range , in our examinations beyond the critical time and temperature .",
    "the external trapping potential is @xmath124 with @xmath125 the radial trap frequency and @xmath126 the angular frequency in the z direction .",

    ", the interactions are assumed to be strong enough to ensure @xmath141 , so that the kinetic energy of the condensate can be neglected according to the thomas - fermi approximation . in typical slow - light experiments in cold atomic gases , @xmath135 remains within these limits .",
    "the time dependence of the density is translated to the condensate expansion and the group velocity increase which in turn affects the amplification factor as shown in the following section .",
    "we note that decoupling of the matter wave dynamics from the optical pulse dynamics is based upon their significantly different time scales .",
    "the dynamics of condesate matter wave happens in the @xmath142 scale , while optical pulse evolves in @xmath3s @xcite .",

    "amplification factor increases with temperature up to a temperature @xmath143 nk , close but less than the critical temperature @xmath121 nk of the bec . in the semi - ideal picture of the condensate density profile",
    ", this is due to the contribution from the increasing effect of the thermal component in the pulse propagation via the group velocity and the length of the condensate .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , the group velocity weakly depends on the temperature in the condensate phase",
    ". thermal behavior of the group velocity can be explained by examining the thermal behavior of the condensate density . in the semi - ideal model that we use both the condensate and the thermal gas components",

    "below the critical temperature , the condensate component emerges sharply and dominates over the thermal background gas .",
    "density varies little at low temperatures .",
    "thus the ultraslow propagation speeds weakly change with the temperature . after the critical temperature , there is no more condensate and the thermal gas gets more rapidly diluted with the temperature , causing the kink in fig .",
    "[ fig:4a ] , which is also observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the main effect of the temperature is the expansion of the condensate which causes the increase of the delay times of the pulse through the condensate and hence @xmath31 increases .",
    "behavior of the amplification factor with the temperature follows that of the effective length . beyond @xmath128 , almost linear behavior of group velocity and the effective length with temperature result in weak dependence of @xmath31 and hence amplification on the temperature . the amplification is larger in the condensation regime due to large group delays .",
    "[ fig:4a ] shows that group velocity of the pulse in the thermal gas regime rises sharply and it is faster than expansion of the atomic cloud shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4b ] .",
    "accordingly , amplification factor sharply drops after a critical temperature close to @xmath128 and continues to decrease slowly in the thermal gas phase .     on temperature , for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",

    "the pulses that can be supported by the condensates should have widths of the order of @xmath153s .",
    "pulses of shorter widths could be supported by considering larger @xmath9 .",
    "the cost however would be to get lower amplification factors as the group velocity would increase with increasing rabi frequency of the control field .",
    "more ingenious designs that specifically considers transparency window enhancement for broadband pulses are proposed @xcite but their integration to the present proposal require further studies .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the feasibility of using bose - einstein condensates for laser pulse amplification .",
    "the method involves the introduction of two becs inside the resonator of a passively mode - locked laser .",
    "the large delay produced by the becs lowers the pulse repetition rate and scales up the output energy .",
    "our calculations show that pulse amplification factors of the order @xmath1 should be possible over a condensate length of @xmath154 m .",
    "we further showed that a second bec could be used to provide dispersion compensation .",
    "however , the amplification factor decreases with time due to the presence of optical absorption .",
    "we have estimated the heating rate to be about @xmath155 mk / sec , which severly limits the operation time of the system in the condensate regime .",
    "a critical time of operation for optimum amplification is found to be about @xmath156s .",
    "that would require an additional optical switching to extract the pulse at the right time out of the cavity .",
    "alternatively , reducing the effects of absorption by considering multi - level eit systems @xcite or designing a compensating simultaneous cooling mechanism on the atomic cloud in eit scheme @xcite can be considered .",
    "this would eliminate the need of reconstruction of the bec to amplify different pulses at optimum conditions . for quick and easy generation of becs atom chips can be promising @xcite . to aim at higher intensities and amplification factors , the nonlinear response of the atomic gas",

    "<S> ultraslow light propagation through the condensate leads to a considerable increase in the cavity round - trip delay time , lowers the effective repetition rate of the laser , and hence scales up the output pulse energy . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently argued that atom - atom interactions would make our proposal even more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> however , neither in our original proposal nor in the case of interactions , limitations due to heating of the condensates by optical energy absorption were taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that there is a critical time of operation , @xmath0 ms , for the optimal amplification factor , which is in the order of @xmath1 at effective condensate lengths in the order of @xmath2 @xmath3 m . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth limitation of the amplifier on the minimum temporal width of the pulse that can be amplified with this technique is also discussed . </S>"
