    "in recent years there has been considerable interest in the study of nearby groupings of young stars that do not appear to be associated with any molecular clouds .",
    "the prototypical example is perhaps the tw  hydrae association @xcite , with an estimated age of 810  myr and some two dozen members .",
    "searches for new members of this group have relied on x - ray properties , kinematics , infrared ( 2mass ) colors , and spectral features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have produced many candidates and motivated detailed follow - up studies to confirm them .",
    "one of those searches , by @xcite , used proper motions from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite for x - ray sources listed in the rosat bright source catalog @xcite .",
    "the authors considered a large area surrounding the previously known members of the tw  hya association , and proposed a list of 23 candidate members that were subsequently followed up spectroscopically by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the present paper discusses one of those objects ,  ( also known as bd@xmath509  3055 , gsc  05493  00324 , 1rxs  j102219.2@xmath5103302 , tyc  54933241 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , j2000 , @xmath8 , spt = k ) .",
    "the kinematic model of the association constructed by @xcite made specific predictions as to the radial velocity expected for each candidate . although the measurements for  by @xcite happened to agree perfectly with those predictions ( @xmath9  ) , @xcite found that the star shows no detectable li  @xmath106708 absorption in its spectrum ( equivalent width @xmath11 m ) , which indicates it is not very young and therefore essentially rules it out as a true member .",
    "they also measured a radial velocity of @xmath12  that is nearly 10  different from the previous measurements , and proposed that the object is a spectroscopic binary .",
    "further measurements by @xcite confirmed the velocity variations and indicated an orbital period of perhaps 1 or 2 years .",
    "even though it was clear that  is not related the tw  hya association , the object was kept on the observing list at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) for the purpose of establishing the orbit .",
    "preliminary solutions appeared to imply a mass for the companion that is larger than the primary , which was puzzling given that the spectrum is single - lined .",
    "additionally , the hipparcos satellite @xcite detected curvature in the proper motion further supporting the binary nature of the object .",
    "we present here the complete analysis of  that combines the astrometry and the spectroscopy and allows us to investigate in more detail the nature of the overmassive secondary star .",

    "hopkins ( arizona ) .",
    "a single echelle order was recorded using a photon - counting intensified reticon detector at a central wavelength of 5187 , giving a spectral coverage of 45 .",
    "the resolving power is @xmath13 .",
    "a total of 34 spectra were obtained from april 2002 until may 2005 , and the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios achieved range from 5 to about 30 per resolution element of 8.5  .",
    "four archival spectra ( s / n of 930 ) were also used , and were obtained for another program in 19851986 with nearly identical instrumentation on the multiple mirror telescope ( also on mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona ) , prior to its conversion to a monolithic mirror .",
    "radial velocities were derived using xcsao @xcite , a one - dimensional cross - correlation program well suited to our relatively low s / n spectra that runs under iraf . for the template we used a synthetic spectrum selected from an extensive library of spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.kurucz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these calculated spectra are available for a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath14 ) , projected rotational velocities ( @xmath15 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath16 ) and metallicities .",
    "the optimum template was determined from grids of cross - correlations over broad ranges in @xmath14 and @xmath17 , seeking to maximize the average correlation weighted by the strength of each exposure .",
    "solar metallicity was assumed to begin with .",
    "the above calculations were repeated for a range of @xmath18 values from 2.0 to 5.0 , which allowed us to derive a rough estimate of the surface gravity for .",
    "we obtained @xmath19 and @xmath20  k. the entire procedure was repeated for metallicities different from solar , but the best match was achieved for templates with the solar composition .",
    "the temperature we derive corresponds to a main - sequence star with spectral type mid - k @xcite .",
    "the rotational broadening was found to be negligible ( formally @xmath21  ) .",
    "@xcite reported a considerably larger value of 8  .",
    "the stability of the zero - point of our velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small run - to - run corrections were applied in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "the radial velocities in the heliocentric frame including these corrections are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "the typical precision of a single measurement is 0.5  .",
    "variations over the 19.4 years of coverage are obvious and show a peak - to - peak amplitude of about 40  .",
    "the period is 570 days , and the eccentricity ( @xmath0 ) is quite significant .",
    "an orbital solution based on these velocities is presented in the second column of table  [ tab : elements ] .",
    "although it is no longer relevant in connection with the possible membership to the tw  hya association , we mention in passing that the center - of - mass velocity @xmath22  of  is far from the value of @xmath23  that had been predicted by @xcite .",
    "the most significant finding , however , is the large mass function of the binary : @xmath24 . for a typical primary mass corresponding to the temperature",
    "we derive , the mass function implies a secondary that is more massive than the primary , yet no signs of another star are obvious in our spectra .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "was observed by the hipparcos satellite from december 1989 to november 1992 , during which 53 astrometric measurements were made .",
    "the trigonometric parallax was determined to be @xmath25  mas .",
    "the uncertainty is somewhat larger than usual , but perhaps understandably so given that the star is relatively faint ( @xmath26 ) . additionally , the hipparcos reductions revealed significant curvature in the proper motion in the amount of @xmath27 mas  yr@xmath28 and @xmath29 mas  yr@xmath28 , most likely a reflection of the orbital motion of the object",
    ". given its period of 570 days , however , nearly two cycles of the orbit were covered during the hipparcos campaign ( which lasted 1058 days ) so that the meaning of those coefficients is obscured . the proper motions and the parallax as reported in the hipparcos catalog are also likely to be compromised .",
    "since the satellite observations are sensitive enough to have detected the orbital motion on the plane of the sky , the best course of action is therefore to make use of the individual astrometric measurements together with the velocities to constrain the orbit , and at the same time re - derive the position , proper motion , and parallax .",
    "those hipparcos measurements are listed in table  [ tab : hip ] .",
    "we describe the global solution below .",
    "the radial velocities allow for the determination of the usual spectroscopic elements , which are the period ( @xmath30 ) , center - of - mass velocity ( @xmath31 ) , semi - amplitude of the velocity variation ( @xmath32 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath33 ) , longitude of periastron for the primary ( @xmath34 ) , and time of periastron passage ( @xmath35 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the visual elements constrained by the astrometry are the angular semimajor axis ( @xmath36 ) , the inclination angle ( @xmath37 ) , the position angle of the ascending node ( @xmath38 ) , as well as @xmath30 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . the combination of the two kinds of measurements thus provides redundancy in the four latter orbital elements that strengthens the solution .",
    "furthermore , the fact that we see no indication of the secondary in the spectrum of  means that the motion seen by hipparcos should essentially be that of the primary star around the center of mass of the binary . this introduces a relation between the angular semimajor axis of the primary , @xmath39 , and its velocity amplitude , given by @xmath40 where @xmath39 and the trigonometric parallax @xmath41 are expressed in milli - arc seconds , @xmath32 in @xmath42 , and @xmath30 in days .",
    "we use this relation to eliminate the angular semimajor axis ( @xmath39 ) as an unknown . since the hipparcos observations are made in an absolute frame of reference , the abscissae residuals contain information on the parallax as well as the position and proper motion of the barycenter of the binary . five additional variables",
    "are thus introduced ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) and @xmath48 . ] , which represent corrections to a fiducial point of reference that yield improved estimates of those quantities over the catalog values ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a total of 13 variables were adjusted in the solution , using standard non - linear least - squares techniques @xcite .",
    "the formalism used for incorporating the abscissae residuals from hipparcos into the fit follows closely that described by @xcite and @xcite , and is described in more detail in the appendix .",
    "the relative weights of the spectroscopic and astrometric observations were adjusted to yield separate reduced @xmath49 values near unity . in this way we determined a scale factor for the original uncertainties of the hipparcos abscissae residuals of 1.14 , and a factor of 1.43 for the original velocity errors .",
    "due to the faintness of the target the median error of a single hipparcos measurement is 5.7 mas , so that the constraint provided by the astrometry is relatively weak . nevertheless , the results of this initial fit yielded improvements in all of the orbital elements in common with the spectroscopy .",
    "the value derived for the angular semimajor axis of the primary was @xmath50  mas .",
    "as a test to see if the astrometry is able to detect the light contribution from the companion , we ran another solution in which we left the semimajor axis of the apparent orbit as a free parameter . in this case",
    "that semimajor axis ( @xmath51 ) corresponds to the motion of the center of light of the binary , or photocenter , rather than that of the primary , and it should in principle be smaller if the light from the secondary is significant .",
    "this fit gave a value of @xmath52  mas , which is not only not smaller but is also much more uncertain ( because it is no longer constrained by the spectroscopy through eq.[[eq : a1 ] ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is still consistent with the previous result , within the errors .",
    "we conclude from this that the companion is not bright enough to produce a measurable astrometric effect , and we proceed under the assumption that that star is invisible ( but see  [ sec : orbit2 ] ) .",
    "slight differences were found in the proper motion components ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) compared to the values reported in the hipparcos catalog , which was not unexpected given that the catalog values do not account for orbital motion .",
    "an external check on these motions is available from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , in which @xmath53 and @xmath54 are derived by combining the hipparcos position ( mean epoch 1991.25 ) with positions from ground - based meridian - circle and photographic catalogs going back several decades , and up to a century in some cases . given that the period of  is only 570 days , the orbital motion over a baseline of decades should tend to average out in the tycho-2 analysis , resulting in a more accurate measure of the proper motion than that reported by hipparcos .",
    "indeed , as shown in table  [ tab : pm ] the values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 from our initial fit are much closer to the tycho-2 values than the hipparcos values .",
    "this also suggests that the solution might benefit if we made use of the constraint provided by tycho-2 .",
    "consequently , we incorporated the tycho-2 proper motions into the fit as measurements , along with their uncertainties .",
    "the resulting proper motions from this combined solution are listed for comparison in the fourth row of table  [ tab : pm ] .",
    "the remaining orbital elements are hardly affected , except for the slightly smaller uncertainties .",
    "the complete results of this combined fit are given in the third column of table  [ tab : elements ] .",
    "the semimajor axis of the relative orbit , @xmath36 , is inferred to be 30.8  mas ( 1.58  au in linear units ) .",
    "the orbital period is determined to better than 0.1% by virtue of the 19.4-yr baseline provided by the velocity measurements ( more than 12 cycles ) .",
    "perhaps one of the most significant improvements coming from the combination of the astrometry and spectroscopy is in the trigonometric parallax . compared to the value from the hipparcos catalog ,",
    "our parallax that takes full account of the orbital motion is nearly 10  mas smaller , which corresponds to a 50% change in the distance to  ( see table  [ tab : pm ] ) , and is considerably more precise .",
    "this has important consequences for the luminosity estimates discussed below .    according to our solution the orbit of the binary",
    "is seen nearly edge - on : the inclination angle is @xmath55 .",
    "although in principle this would allow for eclipses , these are very unlikely given the 570-day period .",
    "inspection of the hipparcos photometry for  shows no evidence of any eclipse events ( four conjunctions occurred during the mission ) , and the peak - to - peak brightness variation recorded is @xmath20.1  mag , which is probably at the level of the uncertainties for a star as faint as @xmath8 . nevertheless , carefully scheduled observations may perhaps be of interest since the satellite measurements do not have the optimal sampling .",
    "the information provided by our combined solution allows a direct determination of the mass of the unseen companion of , given an estimate of the primary mass . for this",
    "we use our effective temperature determination in  [ sec : spectroscopy ] ( @xmath56  k ) , and the brightness of the object .",
    "the latter was measured during the hipparcos mission as @xmath57 , in the passband of the satellite .",
    "conversion to the johnson system @xcite yields @xmath58 , where the uncertainty is our conservative estimate that includes the transformation . with our parallax of @xmath59  mas ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath60  pc )",
    "the absolute magnitude in the visual band is @xmath61 , ignoring extinction , in which essentially all of the uncertainty comes from the parallax error .",
    "the location of the primary star in the h - r diagram is shown in figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "model isochrones from the series by @xcite for solar metallicity agree well with the measured properties of , quite independently of age ( ranging from 1  gyr to 5  gyr in the figure ) . from these models we estimate the primary mass to be @xmath62  m@xmath1 ,",
    "in which the uncertainty accounts for observational errors as well as age .",
    "the surface gravity inferred from the models is @xmath63 , in agreement with our crude estimate from  [ sec : spectroscopy ] .",
    "although the precise metallicity of the star is unknown , our tests in  [ sec : spectroscopy ] suggested a composition near solar .",
    "additionally , the space motion of  in the galactic frame based on our parallax , proper motion , and center - of - mass velocity is quite small ( @xmath64  , @xmath65  , @xmath66  , relative to the local standard of rest ) , which supports a population  i origin and a heavy element abundance probably close to that of the sun , as we have assumed .",
    "the adopted mass for the primary leads to a companion mass of @xmath67  m@xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainty in the primary mass contributes only about 25% to this error .",
    "the secondary star is thus 20% more massive than the primary , which implies it can not be a single main - sequence star .",
    "a more careful examination of our spectra was carried out using the two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm todcor @xcite , to place limits on the brightness of the companion .",
    "this technique often allows the detection and measurement of faint secondaries that are difficult to see in standard one - dimensional cross - correlation diagrams .",
    "no evidence of another set of lines was found down to the level of the noise , at about 10% of the brightness of the primary .",
    "additionally , @xcite reported an observation of  by speckle interferometry in which no companions were apparently seen in the range from 30  mas to 07 .",
    "details of this measurement are unavailable .",
    "one possibility is that the companion is a white dwarf .",
    "depending on its temperature , it may be possible to detect it in the ultraviolet , although no such observations are available to our knowledge . given the present mass of the object , initial - final mass relations for white dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) suggest a progenitor of approximately 45  m@xmath1 , corresponding to a mid - b star . alternatively , the companion of  could itself be a ( closer ) binary composed of lower main - sequence stars , making the system a hierarchical triple . in this case , however , the mass ratio of the binary can not be too small or we would have seen the brighter of the two stars in our spectra .",
    "possible signs of this type of configuration might be seen in the form of an infrared excess .",
    "@xmath68 measurements for  are available from the 2mass catalog . with the visual magnitude listed earlier , and after conversion to the standard johnson system as defined by @xcite using transformations by @xcite , we obtain the observed colors @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 listed in the first line of table  [ tab : photometry ] .",
    "the predicted colors for a single star of the assumed mass ( @xmath72  m@xmath1 ) according to the models by @xcite for a representative age of 2  gyr are indeed bluer , by as much as 0.4  mag .",
    "however , there are a number of reasons to doubt the theoretical colors in this case , including indications of missing opacity sources and other limitations in the physics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and especially disagreements with empirical mass - luminosity relations , particularly in the visual band",
    ". therefore , we have chosen here to rely on the empirical relations .",
    "those by @xcite give redder colors than @xcite for the primary ( see third line of table  [ tab : photometry ] ) , but are still considerably bluer than observed , by 0.17  mag , 0.29  mag , and 0.25  mag for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "these differences are 67 times larger than the observational errors , suggesting the infrared excess may be real .    with the aid of the @xcite relations , we have modeled this excess by computing the visual and @xmath73 magnitudes of the components of the unseen companion ( hereafter star  2 and star  3 ) over a range of possible masses for each star , subject to the constraint that their sum be the value we determined above , @xmath74  m@xmath1 .",
    "we then added the light of these stars to that of the primary ( star  1 ) in each passband , and calculated the combined colors for the triple system .",
    "for convenience we parameterized the problem in terms of the mass ratio of the binary ( @xmath75 , where star  2 is the more massive component ) . additionally , we allowed for changes in the mass of the main star , and sought to produce the best match to the observed colors as well as the combined absolute visual magnitude , in a @xmath49 sense .",
    "a solution was found for a mass @xmath76  m@xmath1 and a binary mass ratio @xmath77 , which reproduces the observed visual brightness and all infrared colors within the uncertainties ( see last row of table  [ tab : photometry ] ) .",
    "contours of the @xmath49 surface as a function of @xmath78 and @xmath79 are shown in figure  [ fig : contours ] , where the best fit is indicated by a dot .",
    "the masses of the binary components from this model are @xmath80  m@xmath1 and @xmath81  m@xmath1 .",
    "the predicted magnitude difference in the visual band between the brighter of these stars and star  1 is 3.0  mag , which is below our threshold for spectroscopic detection ( @xmath22.5  mag ; see above ) and is thus consistent with all observational constraints .",
    "although this is formally the best fit to the observations , we note that the @xmath49 surface is nearly flat in the @xmath79 direction for @xmath79 larger than about 0.70.8 at a fixed value of @xmath78 , so that larger mass ratios up to and including unity are equally acceptable and reproduce the observed colors just as well ( see figure  [ fig : contours ] ) .",
    "the mass of star  1 , on the other hand , is very tightly constrained . at @xmath82 stars 2 and 3",
    "would be at their faintest , each about 3.3  mag fainter than star  1 .",
    "even though , according to the model above , both stars in the binary are too faint to be seen individually in our spectra , their combined light is not negligible compared to the brightness of star  1 . the difference is approximately 2.5  mag in the visual band .",
    "this suggests that our earlier assumption that the astrometric motion detected by hipparcos traces only the motion of star  1 may not be entirely correct . the extra light ( even with @xmath83 ) must affect the astrometry at some level , despite our failure to detect the effect directly , as described in  [ sec : orbit1 ] .",
    "this will cause the semimajor axis of the photocenter , @xmath51 , to be slightly smaller than that of the primary alone by a factor @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the mass fraction of the companion and @xmath86 is its fractional light .",
    "we therefore adjusted our orbital solution to allow for this effect , and recomputed all orbital elements .",
    "the results of this  constrained \" solution are seen in the last column of table  [ tab : elements ] .",
    "the semimajor axis of the photocenter is reduced from @xmath87  mas to @xmath88  mas , a small effect .",
    "the residuals of the radial - velocity observations from this fit are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] , and those of the hipparcos measurements are given in table  [ tab : hip ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : rvs ] displays the spectroscopic measurements along with the velocity curve as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the astrometric observations on the plane of the sky are illustrated in figure  [ fig : hip1 ] and figure  [ fig : hip2 ] , in which the axes are parallel to the right ascension and declination directions .",
    "the curious pattern in figure  [ fig : hip1 ] is the result of the combined effects of annual parallax , proper motion , and orbital motion .",
    "the dominant contribution is from the proper motion ( 80  mas  yr@xmath89 ) , which is indicated with an arrow .",
    "parallax and orbital motion are smaller and comparable effects . in figure",
    "[ fig : hip2 ] we have subtracted the proper motion and parallactic contributions , leaving only the orbital motion with the 570-day period and a semimajor axis of @xmath90  mas .",
    "the direction of motion is direct ( counterclockwise ) .",
    "the individual hipparcos observations are represented schematically in both of these figures , but are seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : hip2 ] . because they are one - dimensional in nature @xcite , the exact location of each measurement on the plane of the sky can not be shown graphically .",
    "the filled circles represent the predicted location on the computed orbit .",
    "the dotted lines connecting to each filled circle indicate the scanning direction of the hipparcos satellite for each measurement , and show which side of the orbit the residual is on .",
    "the short line segments at the end of and perpendicular to the dotted lines indicate the direction along which the actual observation lies , although the precise location is undetermined .",
    "occasionally more than one measurement was taken along the same scanning direction , in which case two or more short line segments appear on the same dotted lines .    compared to our previous solution ,",
    "the parallax is increased slightly to @xmath4  mas , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath91  pc .",
    "the proper motion components change very little ( table  [ tab : pm ] ) .",
    "the binary mass derived with @xmath92  m@xmath1 is marginally larger than before ( @xmath93  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the change in the parallax leads to a revised absolute magnitude for the system of @xmath94 .",
    "with these updated values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 we repeated the photometric modeling using the @xcite mass - luminosity relations , and obtained a solution not very different from the previous one ( the same value of @xmath78 , and @xmath97 , implying @xmath98  m@xmath1 and @xmath99  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the brightness difference between star  1 and the sum of stars 2 and 3 is unchanged , making another iteration of our orbital solution unnecessary .",
    "is an interesting illustration of the complementarity of spectroscopic and astrometric observations , and in particular of the utility of the hipparcos intermediate data ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the radial - velocity measurements clearly reveal this object to be a binary and provide the ( single - lined ) spectroscopic orbit with a period of 570 days , the combination with the astrometry has allowed us to derive the dynamical mass of the companion ( @xmath100  m@xmath1 ) and also to correct the seriously biased parallax value from the original hipparcos reductions .",
    "no indications of the companion are detected in our spectra , yet the orbital solution shows that it is clearly more massive than the visible star , which is a normal k dwarf with @xmath101  m@xmath1 . while we can not completely rule out that the secondary is a massive white dwarf , all the evidence points quite convincingly toward the conclusion that the companion is itself a closer binary composed of m dwarfs , making the system a hierarchical triple .",
    "the infrared excess that might be expected from such a configuration appears indeed to be present , as indicated by our modeling of the measured visual and near - infrared ( 2mass ) photometry using empirical mass - luminosity relations by @xcite , along with the constraint on the total mass of the unseen companion .",
    "this modeling can not determine the precise mass ratio of the close binary , but is able to place a lower limit of about @xmath102 .",
    "smaller values would make one of the stars bright enough that it would be seen in our spectra .",
    "we infer masses for these stars of approximately @xmath103  0.440.48  m@xmath1 and @xmath104  0.410.44  m@xmath1 .",
    "the period of the close binary is unknown .",
    "we note also that  is listed as an x - ray source in the rosat catalog , with @xmath105 @xcite and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "this x - ray emission might arise naturally from the presence of the m dwarfs , which are frequently active , particularly if they are in a short - period configuration so that tidal forces compel the stars to be in synchronous rotation with the orbital motion .    finally , the relative orbit of  and its unseen companion has an angular semimajor axis of about 33  mas . given the eccentricity of the orbit , separations up to about 50  mas are possible at times , which may permit a direct detection of the secondary with high - resolution techniques .",
    "alternatively , infrared spectroscopy should be able to reveal the presence of at least the brighter of the m dwarfs directly , given the more favorable contrast with the main star at those wavelengths .",
