    "the insider s optimal investment is a classical problem where an investor possessing some extra flow of information aims to maximize the expected utility on the final value of her portfolio .",
    "as the insider has more information , she has access to a larger set of available trading strategies , leading to a higher expected utility from terminal wealth . in the literature",
    ", an interesting question has been studied : what is the cost of the extra information ? from an indifference point of view , we search for the value at which the investor accepts to buy the information at the initial time , that is , the amount of money she is ready to pay such that this cost is offset by the increase of the maximal expected utility .",
    "this is the approach adopted by amendinger et al .",
    "@xcite , where the authors study the value of an initial information in the setting of a complete default free market . the extra information they consider is a terminal information distorted by an independent noise , for example , a noisy signal of a functional of the final value of the assets .",
    "we adopt a more direct manner : we are interested in the gain of the insider from her investment strategy on the portfolio compared to other investors not having access to the extra information .",
    "the originality of our paper is to study this problem in the context of credit risks : the insider s information concerns the default risk of a counterparty firm .    during the financial crisis",
    ", the counterparty default has become an important source of risk we need to take into account .",
    "jiao and pham @xcite have considered an optimal investment problem where the risky asset in the portfolio is subjected to the default risk of a counterparty firm and its value may suffer a sudden loss at the counterparty default time @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is a good benchmark in our study in order to quantify the value of the extra information .",
    "the accessible information for a standard investor is described as in the classical credit risk modelling by bielecki and rutkowski @xcite , using the progressive enlargement of a reference `` default - free '' filtration @xmath2 by the default @xmath0 . to analyze the impact of default , the default density framework developed in el karoui et al .",
    "@xcite has been adopted .",
    "this current paper concentrates on an insider in comparison with a standard investor .",
    "both agents can invest in the same risk - free asset and risky one and they observe the same market price for each asset .",
    "however , the insider possesses more information on the risky asset since it is influenced by the counterparty default on which the insider has additional knowledge . due to the extra information",
    ", the insider may gain larger profit .",
    "the insider s information is modelled by using an initial enlargement of filtration as in @xcite and in grorud and pontier @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the credit risk context , we model the default time @xmath0 as the first time that a stochastic process hits a random barrier @xmath1 .",
    "the insider knows the barrier from the initial time and the other investors only see its value at the default time .",
    "this extra information is called the insider s information , or the full information in hillairet and jiao @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the insider s optimization problem in parallel with the one studied in @xcite .",
    "the canonical decomposition of processes adapted to the enlarged filtration induces to specify the investment strategies on the two sets : before - default one @xmath3 and after - default one @xmath4 , which is a similar point to @xcite .",
    "however , due to the extra knowledge on the default barrier @xmath1 , the insider s strategy depends on @xmath1 before the counterparty default , which is not the case for the standard investor .",
    "if the default occurs , the insider s strategy will depend on the default time @xmath0 . from the methodology point of view , the main difference here is that for the insider , the default time is modelled as in the classical structural approach model since the random barrier @xmath1 is known , so that @xmath0 becomes a stopping time w.r.t .",
    "the reference filtration @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the default density hypothesis , which is crucial in @xcite , fails to hold for the insider and we can no longer adopt the conditional density approach in this situation .",
    "we apply the theory of initial enlargement of filtration , assuming that the conditional law of @xmath1 given @xmath6 is equivalent to the law of @xmath1 . the corresponding radon nikodym derivative process , @xmath7 will play a key role in our methodology .",
    "the main observation of our study is that , if the short - selling is not regulated , then the insider can obtain unbounded terminal wealth .",
    "this justifies the necessity to consider the optimization problem with portfolio strategies where the short - selling is limited to a given level .",
    "we decompose the optimization problem as an after - default problem and a global before - default one , that we solve respectively by using the dual and the dynamic programming methods . to make comparison with the standard investor in @xcite",
    ", we choose to consider crra utility function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we introduce the model for the counterparty default , and we define and compare the informational structure of an insider with respect to a standard investor . in section 3",
    "we present the insider s investment problem and we decompose it into an after - default and global before - default ones , using the radon nikodym derivative process .",
    "we also prove the necessity of imposing short selling constraint for the insider to exclude the value process to reach infinity . in section 4",
    "we solve the two optimization problems : the after - default one through duality methods in a default free complete market , and the global before - default one through dynamic programming approach .",
    "we perform theorical comparison of the value process of the after - default optimization problem , and for the global before - default optimization problem , the comparison is done in section 5 through numerical illustrations .",
    "we first introduce the model for the counterparty default , which is a general and standard model in the credit risk analysis .",
    "let us fix a probability space @xmath8 equipped with a reference filtration @xmath2 satisfying the usual conditions , which represents the `` default - free '' information .",

    "we model the default time as the first passage time of the process @xmath12 to a positive random barrier @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath13where the default threshold @xmath1 is a positive @xmath14-measurable random variable .",
    "in the particular but widely used case of cox process model , @xmath1 is independent of @xmath15 and follows the uni - exponential law . in the case where @xmath1 is constant or deterministic , @xmath0 is an @xmath5-stopping time as in the classical structural default models .",
    "@xmath9 _ information of the insider _",
    "we suppose that , besides the information on the `` default - free '' market , the insider has complete information on @xmath1 : this is the case for example of the counterparty firm s managers who determine the default threshold .",
    "this full information is modelled as the initial enlargement of the filtration @xmath5 by @xmath1 and denoted by @xmath16 . without loss of generality",
    ", we assume that all the filtrations we deal with in the following satisfy the usual conditions .",
    "we suppose that a standard investor on the market observes whether the default has occurred or not and if so , the default time @xmath0 , together with the information contained in the filtration @xmath5 .",

    "after the default occurs , both of them observe the default event and subsequently the value of @xmath1 so that they have equal information flow .",

    "the insider has access to the same financial market as the standard investor , more precisely , she can invest in two types of financial assets .",
    "the first one is a risk - free bond with strictly positive values .",
    "we choose it as the numraire and assume , without loss of generality that the value of this bond equal to @xmath45 .",
    "the other asset is a risky one which is affected by default risk of the counterparty firm on which the insider has extra information .",
    "the price of this risky asset is observable by all investors on market at any time @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "since it is subject to the counterparty default risk , the price process is modelled by a @xmath47-adapted process @xmath48 , which admits the decomposition form @xmath49where @xmath50 is @xmath5-adapted and @xmath51 is @xmath32-adapted .",

    "indeed , if the investor and the insider have the same utility function and if they can invest in the same financial assets , then the only difference between them relies on their available information in the sense that the corresponding filtrations satisfy @xmath108 , which implies the same inclusion for the sets of admissible strategies : @xmath109 . thus the corresponding value functions satisfy @xmath110 \\leq v_0.\\ ] ] since the supremum in @xmath111 is taken on a smaller set than the one in @xmath112 .",

    "nevertheless , the approach we adopt here is different since , as mentioned previously , the random time @xmath0 is not a totally inaccessible random time for the insider and we can no longer use the conditional density approach to solve the problem .    our approach will use the theory of initial enlargement of filtration ( also called the strong information modeling in @xcite ) by using the value of the random default barrier @xmath1 known to the insider .",
