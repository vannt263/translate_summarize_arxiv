    "<S> we generalize the spin meissner effect for exciton - polariton condensate confined in annular geometries to the case of non - trivial topology of the condensate wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the conventional spin meissner state , topological spin meissner states can in principle be observed at arbitrary high magnetic field not limited by the critical magnetic field value for the condensate in a simply - connected geometry . </S>",
    "<S> one special example of the topological meissner states are half - vortices . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the absence of magnetic field half - vortices in a ring exist in a form of superposition of elementary half - vortex states which resolves recent experimental results where such puzzling superposition was observed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that if a pure half - vortex state is to be observed , a non - zero magnetic field of a specific magnitude needs to be applied . </S>",
    "<S> studying exciton - polariton in a ring in presence of te - tm splitting , we observe spin meissner states which break rotational symmetry of the system by developing inhomogeneous density distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we classify various states arising in presence of non - zero te - tm splitting based on what states they can be continued from by increasing the te - tm splitting parameter from zero . with further increasing te - tm splitting , </S>",
    "<S> states with broken symmetry may transform into stable half - dark solitons and therefore may serve as a useful tool to generate various non - trivial states of a spinor condensate . </S>"
