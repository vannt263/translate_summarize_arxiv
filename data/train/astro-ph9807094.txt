    "the cepheid period  luminosity ( pl ) relation has been one of the cornerstones of distance determination since the beginning of this century . most of the recent determination of the hubble constant @xmath0 are based on hst observations of cepheids as far away as the virgo and fornax clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , an assumed universal pl relation calibrated in the lmc , and the so - called @xcite method . at the same time , modern evolutionary and pulsation calculations are under way to obtain a theoretical calibration of the cepheid pl relation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the number of available cepheids towards the magellanic clouds has been dramatically increased by the different microlensing surveys ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . with the commissionning of the new eros survey equipment ( eros  2 , bauer et al .",
    "1997 ) , a new systematic search for cepheid variables in the lmc and smc was undertaken in october 1996 . in this article , we present the first result from this search , a so far unreported slope change of the pl relation for fundamental mode smc cepheids at short periods .",
    "we describe the observational setup and data reduction in sect .  2 .",
    "in sect .  3 we present the pl relations of fundamental mode ( hereafter f ) and first overtone ( hereafter 1-ot ) cepheids towards both magellanic clouds .",
    "the pl relation of f cepheids towards the smc displays a visible non  linearity for periods shorter than about 2 days , and we establish the statistical significance of this effect .",
    "we then discuss different possible observational biases . in sect .",
    "4 we study the spatial distribution and in sect .  5",
    "we present the depth dispersion of our smc cepheids . in sect .",
    "6 we develop possible scenarios that could explain the effect , before summarizing in sect .  7",
    "we give here only a brief overview as more details will be available in the eros  2 cepheid catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations were obtained using the new eros  2 experimental setup , which consists of a 1  m ritchey  chretien telescope and two 4k  @xmath1 8k ccd mosaic cameras , allowing simultaneous imaging in two focal planes with different colour passbands ( 420650 nm , so called eros-2 @xmath2 passband ; and 650900 nm , so called eros-2 @xmath3 passband ) .",
    "each ccd mosaic is made up of eight 2k  @xmath1 2k three edge buttable thick ccds developped by loral / u.arizona .",
    "the pixel size is 0.6  arcsec ( 15  @xmath4 m ) .",
    "the available global field of view is 0.7@xmath5 ( right ascension )  @xmath1 1.4@xmath5 ( declination ) .",
    "the whole system was mounted at the la silla observatory in chile in june 1996 ; details can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    between october 1996 and february 1997 , a dedicated cepheid campaign was undertaken .",
    "two fields per magellanic cloud ( see table [ table_champ ] ) were monitored about once per night with an exposure time of 20 seconds .",
    "whenever possible , the four fields were imaged almost simultaneously at the same airmass .",
    "a total of @xmath6110 - 160 images was obtained for each field .",
    ".coordinates ( j2000 ) of the field centres . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to further investigate the effect , we have compared the spatial distributions along the wesselink @xmath7 and @xmath8 coordinates ( @xcite ) of smc f  cepheids with @xmath9  days and @xmath10  days .    along the @xmath8 coordinate , no significant difference is observed . along the @xmath7",
    "coordinate , while smc f  cepheids with @xmath9  days are uniformly distributed in our field , those with @xmath10  days are concentrated toward the center of the cloud ( see fig .",
    "[ distri_spatial ] ) . a comparison between smc 1-ot  cepheids with @xmath11  day and @xmath12  day leads to a similar conclusion .",
    "these observations are quantified using a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( see table [ table_kolmogorov ] ) . from this table",
    ", it also appears that the distributions are similar for short period f and 1-ot  cepheids , and for long period f and 1-ot cepheids as well . to summarize , the distribution along @xmath7 of short period f and 1-ot cepheids are incompatible with that of long period cepheids at the 4.5 @xmath13 level at least .",
    "+ in view of this , we have repeated the fits of sect .",
    "3 separately for @xmath14 and @xmath15  arcsec , to search for a possible spatial dependence of the slope change . this study is inconclusive however because of the much lower abundance of long  period cepheids for @xmath14  arcsec ( see top of fig .",
    "[ distri_spatial ] ) .",
    "we have checked if the reported effect could be due to a distance effect , using the reddening free magnitude @xmath16 , corresponding to : @xmath17 the two factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 have been calculated using a convolution of the eros transmission function with the extinction law given by @xcite . + as observed by @xcite , the reddening index @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ wdef ] ) happens to be close to the color term @xmath21 in the period - luminosity - color equation : @xmath22 subtracting eq .",
    "( [ plcdef ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ wdef ] ) yields : @xmath23    thus @xmath16 is almost free from the effects of reddening and of color in the instability strip .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ resspatial ] a difference in spatial structure is visible for different intervals of @xmath16residuals , linear fit . ]",
    "that is probably a translation of the three dimensional structure of the smc .    in fig .",
    "[ wpl ] we show the pl relation for f  cepheids in the @xmath16 band .",
    "the effect , though still visible , is not statistically significant .",
    "note however that the photometric error of 0.04  mag for @xmath24 and @xmath25 translate into a 0.15  mag dispersion in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , given our photometric accuracy , we are unable to exclude a correlation between the observed non  linearity and depth dispersion using this approach .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to give a firm explanation of the reported effect .",
    "we discuss below four different hypotheses based on qualitative considerations , which ideally should explain :    * the observed non - linearity of the pl relation for smc f  cepheids , * the absence of non - linearity for smc 1-ot cepheids , * the spatial distributions mentionned in sect .",
    "they are :    * a superposition of two cepheid populations of different ages at different distances ; * the mixing of two classes of variable stars ; * a non uniform filling of the instability strip ; * a thinning of the instability strip itself at short periods .      in the previous section",
    "we have seen that long and short period cepheids are distributed differently along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "if their distributions differ also along the line - of - sight , and if the short period cepheids are in average more distant , the slope variation in the pl relation could be explained .",
    "for example a population of short period ( older ) cepheids behind a population of long period ( younger ) cepheids could indicate a star formation region in the foreground . in this case",
    "the population of short period cepheids would be remnants of older star formation regions and thus exhibit a flatter spatial distribution along the @xmath7 coordinate .",
    "on the other hand the absence of a non - linearity for 1-ot cepheids , in spite of the fact that they have similar @xmath8 and @xmath7 distributions as f  cepheids , challenges this explanation . to further investigate this , we will soon extend the present study to a wider field .",
    "confirmation of this scenario would provide a tool to study the recent history of star formation in the smc .",
    "this hypothesis involves the superposition of two stellar populations , classical cepheids and the so - called anomalous cepheids .",
    "the latter have periods ranging between @xmath26 0.52 days and are seen in dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "their pl relation is known to be metallicity dependent ( @xcite ) . for a typical smc metallicity",
    ", anomalous cepheids would be too faint for a superposition to occur . using the pl relations of classical cepheids ( madore & freedman 1991 ) and anomalous cepheids ( @xcite )",
    ", we estimate that a superposition requires values of [ fe / h ] as low as -3.3 @xmath27 0.6 for a 1 day period in the b passband , well below common smc metallicities .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , the pl relation is the projection of a narrow band in the period  luminosity ",
    "colour plane called the instability strip , where stellar envelopes become unstable and are subject to radial pulsations . during their evolution , stars in the mass range 28 m@xmath28 will typically cross this zone three times .",
    "the first crossing occurs when stars evolve rapidly away from the main sequence .",
    "the two subsequent crossings occur when these stars start helium burning and evolve on horizontal evolution tracks ( or blue loops ) .",
    "the extent of the blue loop is very sensitive to metallicity and will tell whether a star of given mass will cross the instability strip or not .",
    "it is also known that this loop becomes smaller with decreasing mass .    in this scenario",
    "[ scenario ] , scenario 3 ) the blue loop for stars with masses smaller than @xmath63.6 m@xmath28 ( corresponding to @xmath29 days smc cepheids ) would stop before reaching the blue edge of the instability strip .",
    "the resulting observed non  linearity of the pl relation , below a given period , would be the consequence of this decreasing extent of blue loops at small masses .",
    "following the observations reported here and in @xcite , baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have computed evolutionary models , coupled to a linear non - adiabatic stability analysis , in order to get consistent mass  period  luminosity relations .",
    "they report a change in the slope consistent with our observations .    on the other hand",
    "this hypothesis has to fulfill one important constraint : the instability strip for 1ot cepheids is in average bluer than that for f  cepheids ; thus a depopulation of the 1ot instability strip should also be visible , at about 0.7 @xmath1 2  days for smc cepheids .",
    "the absence of such a clear slope change for smc 1ot cepheids challenges this explanation .      this hypothesis ( fig .",
    "[ scenario ] , scenario 4 ) involves the physics of the pulsation itself and assumes that the blue edge of the instability strip becomes non  linear around @xmath30  days for f  cepheids .",
    "in this admittedly speculative scenario , the absence of an effect for 1  ot cepheids seems possible .",
    "the observed non - linearity could thus give a new and useful constraint for stellar pulsation theory describing short period ( i.e. small mass ) and low metallicity cepheids .",
    "it is worth closing this discussion with remarks about lmc cepheids in the light of the four scenarios discussed above .",
    "scenario  1 is specific to the smc and has no implication for lmc cepheids .",
    "regarding scenarios 2 and 3 , in the interesting mass range ( 24 m@xmath28 ) , stellar evolution theory predicts smaller blue loops for the lmc than for the smc because of the higher lmc metallicity .",
    "thus a non uniform population of the instability strip ( scenario 3 ) should also be visible in our lmc  f cepheid dataset , but for even longer period cepheids .",
    "an indication for an abrupt end of the pl relation for lmc  f cepheids can be seen in fig .",
    "[ pl ] at 2.5 days ; this has also been observed and modelled by the macho collaboration ( @xcite ) , who explain the short period cepheids as beeing anomalous cepheids . in our sample the 12 lmc f  cepheids with @xmath31  days and 37 lmc 1-ot cepheids with @xmath32  days , would belong to this anomalous cepheid population .    in scenario 4 finally",
    ", we would not observe a non  linearity of the blue edge of the instability strip , if stellar evolution constrains the population of f  cepheids to periods larger than 2.5  days .",
    "we have presented the pl diagrams from a dedicated lmc / smc cepheid observation campaign with the eros  2 setup .",
    "for the first time , a change in the slope of the pl relation for short period smc f  cepheids is observed . for smc f  cepheids with periods smaller than 2.0 days the magnitude deviation compared to the entire pl relation reaches 0.2  mag . on the other hand",
    "we observe no similar effect for 1-ot cepheids . furthermore ,",
    "long and short period smc cepheids display significantly different spatial distributions .",
    "we have presented different possible explanations for these observations and it is clear that further studies are needed to select the most likely one . with the amount of eros data available and if the absence of a slope change for 1-ot cepheid is confirmed , scenario 4",
    "  a curvature of the blue edge of the instability strip   seems the most natural one .",
    "finally , we remark that the reported phenomenon does not affect the pl relation used in the hst key project for the determination of h@xmath33 , as it is based on longer period cepheids .",
    "we thank the referee , whose remarks led us to look closer into the spatial distributions .",
    "the authors are particularly grateful to the eso staff at the la silla observatory for their night and day assistance .",
    "we wish to thank the observatoire de haute provence technical staff for their help in refurbishing and mounting the marly telescope .",
