    "it is also not clear whether an analogy with bilayer graphene is relevant  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we derive a tb model from group theory for the m-@xmath2 and x-@xmath6 orbitals and fix its free parameters using the matrix elements obtained from the mlwfs .",
    "this sets the basis for a future derivation of a full and accurate tight binding model and the corresponding effective @xmath7 models .    from the tb parameters obtained from density functional theory",

    "we want to mention that the mismatch between our tb model and the dft bands comes from two sources .",
    "the first is the truncation of the range of hopping parameters .",
    "the second source comes from a residual mixing between m and x orbitals inherent to wannier90 ( this is the consequence of the fact that the algorithm does nt use any symmetry constraints ) while in our model we work with disentangled orbitals .",
    "this issue will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "however since the m - x mixing of the mlwfs is quantitatively small , the incorporation of the matrix elements obtained by wannier90 into our tb model leads to a good qualitative picture .",
