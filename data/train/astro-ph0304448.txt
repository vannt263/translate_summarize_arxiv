    "collapsars , or failed supernovae , are one of two or a few currently favored explanations for the origin of long duration grbs . in collapsars ,",
    "the relativistic jet which shocks and ultimately gives rise to observed grb photons must first pass through a massive stellar mantle . here",
    "it is shown that this passage is associated with an interesting neutrino signal .",
    "a number of grb - related neutrino sources have been previously investigated .",
    "these sources can be roughly divided according to whether they involve pion production via photomeson interactions or via strong interactions .",
    "neutrinos resulting from photomeson interactions typically have very high energies ( @xmath0 ) and are possibly the most easily detectable in planned km - scale neutrino detectors such as icecube @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed photomeson production of neutrinos in collisionless grb shocks and argued that detection of these neutrinos would give information on the spectra of photons and protons within the shocks , as well as place stringent constraints on fundamental neutrino properties .",
    "neutrinos from inelastic nuclear collisions typically have energies of the order of 10 gev .",
    "unless the phototube density in icecube and other next generation neutrino telescopes is higher than currently planned , these detectors will have a small effective detector area for such low energy neutrinos and will not be sensitive to them @xcite .",
    "however , there is a growing indication that , like neutrinos from @xmath1 interactions , these neutrinos may be an important clue to conditions in and around the grb central engine .",
    "@xcite discussed the neutrino signal from inelastic collisions occurring during the dynamic decoupling of neutrons in the acceleration stage of the evolution of a grb fireball .",
    "these neutrinos offer an indication of the composition and lorentz factor of the grb jet .",
    "neutron diffusion in grb environments was considered in a more general context by @xcite .",
    "those authors showed that internal shocks at radii @xmath2 and transverse diffusion of neutrons into the jet at much larger radii can lead to an appreciable neutrino signal .",
    "the possibility of using neutrinos to distinguish between collapsars and supranovae @xcite was discussed by @xcite .",
    "the scenario envisaged by guetta and granot is unique in that it predicts tev neutrinos from nuclear processes .",
    "this is because of the presence in their model of protons accelerated to very high energies in a pulsar wind bubble .",
    "the multi - gev collapsar neutrino signal we study here is related to the mechanism giving rise to the variation in lorentz factor of the outgoing jet . as with any grb model invoking internal shocks",
    ", the jet variability must be substantial in order to explain observed temporal variability in grbs , as well as to allow efficient conversion of kinetic energy to electromagnetic energy ( see @xcite for a general overview ) . in most grb models ,",
    "the jet variability is related to a variability in the mass ablation rate or luminosity of the central source driving the outflow . by contrast",
    ", the jet variability in the collapsar can arise from instabilities along the jet - stellar wall interface @xcite .",
    "these instabilities operate at radii large compared to the size of the central black hole . consequently , the instabilities act to slow a jet which has already had ample time to reach ultra - relativistic velocities .",
    "we point out that when free neutrons are present in the jet , this slowing is not elastic and is accompanied by a sizeable neutrino flux .    in the next section",
    "we discuss details of how the slowing of the neutrons in the jet leads to the conversion of jet energy to potentially observable neutrinos .",
    "estimates of neutrino detection rates and energies are presented .",
    "we will show that the neutrino signal of the slowing of the jet can originate from radii some two orders of magnitude smaller than the signal of processes discussed by @xcite .",
    "also , the neutrino production we discuss here is relatively insensitive to the bulk lorentz factor of the outgoing jet , unlike other proposed sources of multi - gev grb neutrinos .",
    "the mechanism giving rise to the variability in the outgoing jet can be crudely represented as the closing of a dense door composed of stellar material at some point along the jet axis .",
    "this results in a forward shock propagating into and accelerating the stellar material , and a reverse shock propagating backwards and slowing the jet . because the stellar material blocking the passage of the jet is typically very dense relative to the jet material , the forward shock",
    "will only be mildly relativistic and uninteresting as far as a detectable neutrino signature is concerned .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ blob2 ] illustrates the shocking and structure of the outgoing jet .    as particles in the jet",
    "traverse the reverse shock , they are decelerated from a lorentz factor @xmath3 to a lorentz factor @xmath4 . here the superscript @xmath5 denotes a quantity as measured in the rest frame of the collapsing star .",
    "the relative lorentz factor across the shock is @xmath6 .",
    "numerical simulations of relativistic jets propagating in stars indicate that the typical relative lorentz factor is substantial .",
    "zhang et al . studied the propagation of a relativistic jet in a 15@xmath7 star for 3 different initial jet conditions .",
    "typical values of @xmath8 for their simulations are given in table [ thetable ] .",
    "the simulations of zhang et al . , as well as observations of many peaks in observed grb lightcurves , indicate that a substantial fraction ( half or more ) of the jet undergoes a slowing via relativistic shocks .",
    "the gross properties of the reverse shock slowing the jet are given by the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions .",
    "in particular , the proper baryon number density in the shocked jet ( i.e. the baryon number density as measured in a frame comoving with the shocked fluid ) is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the proper baryon number density in the unshocked jet .",
    "for radii larger than @xmath11 , which is the region of interest in the present work , the outgoing jet is coasting rather than accelerating @xcite . in the coasting regime , @xmath10 is determined by baryon number conservation as @xmath12 .",
    "observations of grbs suggest that the isotropic equivalent luminosity @xmath13 is of order @xmath14 @xcite , and that typically @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the energy density in the shocked jet fluid is @xmath16 , provided that the specific enthalpy in the unshocked jet is small ( i.e. that the jet is in the coasting regime ) . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ blob2 ] we show the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath3 in the jet .",
    "pion production and associated neutrino production in the reverse shock depend in detail on the processes mediating the shock .",
    "it is convenient in discussing the shock structure to consider separately those particles which interact electromagnetically ( protons-@xmath17-photons ) and the neutrons .",
    "neutrons can only be slowed by strong collisions with other nucleons . because the length scales associated with electromagnetic processes are small compared to the neutron mean free path , an upper limit to the width of the shock",
    "can be obtained by considering the case where strong nucleon - nucleon collisions alone mediate the shock .",
    "such collisional shocks have been studied by @xcite in the non - relativistic case and by @xcite and @xcite in the relativistic case .",
    "we take as an upper limit to the shock width the collisional width @xmath18 found from the monte - carlo simulations of @xcite . here",
    "@xmath19 is the strong scattering cross section and the shock width is as measured in a frame comoving with the shock .",
    "for center of mass energies a few hundred mev above the threshold for pion production , @xmath20 , and approximately @xmath21 of this cross section goes towards inelastic production of pions ( see @xcite for a compilation of strong cross sections ) . for this work ,",
    "the important properties of @xmath22 are i ) that because the shock width is at most a few collisional mean free paths , the neutron - nucleon collisions slowing the shock are hard and produce pions , and ii ) because @xmath23 , the number of inelastic collisions suffered by a typical neutron in traversing the shock is approximately independent of @xmath8 . a close - up view of inelastic neutron - nucleon collisions and associated pion production in the reverse shock is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ blob2 ] .",
    "protons in the shock will be slowed by electromagnetic , rather than strong , processes . deep within the star , where the shocks considered in this paper are occurring ,",
    "the plasma is optically thick and the thermalization time for radiation is short .",
    "consequently , we approximate the protons as being in thermal equilibrium with the background @xmath24 plasma .",
    "the temperature of the protons in this case is small , @xmath25 , and the protons are non - relativistic in the shocked plasma frame .",
    "our assumption about the proton distribution function is in accord with results from studies of shock propagation in type ii sne ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite have argued that protons shocked in mildly relativistic collisions at large radii inside the collapsar will be driven to a power law distribution , but that protons shocked in the strongly relativistic collision between the jet head and the stellar mantle may or may not have a power law distribution .",
    "the question of the precise radius ( presumably larger than @xmath26 ) at which shocks are collisionless rather than radiative is not addressed here .",
    "as we are most interested in processes at @xmath27 , this issue is not so important for the present study .    in the inelastic collisions slowing the neutrons",
    ", the total energy going into pion production in the center of mass frame of the collision is @xmath28 ( e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath29 is the energy of the collision in the center of mass frame , and the above equation is valid provided that @xmath30 is larger than a few times the pion rest mass energy . very near the threshold for pion production , @xmath31 .",

    "for example , for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , 12 , and 7 gev , for @xmath44 , 10 , and 1 respectively .",
    "the neutrino signal of the inelastic collisions depends on how the spectrum of pions produced in these collisions is modified by cooling processes .",
    "pion cooling may proceed through inelastic strong scatterings , or via electromagnetic interactions - coulomb scattering off the background electrons , inverse compton scattering , and synchrotron emission .    cooling via strong scatterings",
    "is simply characterized by the @xmath45nucleon interaction time .",
    "we can roughly approximate @xmath46 collisions as occurring in the shocked region ( as opposed to the region of width @xmath22 characterizing the shock ) . in this case",
    "the @xmath45nucleon interaction time is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the nucleon - pion scattering cross section .",
    "for center of mass energies a few hundred mev larger than the pion rest mass , @xmath49 @xcite . as with nn collisions , the bulk of this cross section goes toward inelastic @xmath50 production . though inelastic @xmath51 collisions may roughly conserve the total energy in pions",
    ", they tend to reduce the average pion energy , making detection of the product neutrinos more difficult .",
    "note that because @xmath52 and @xmath53 are comparable , a more accurate expression for @xmath54 should involve an effective nucleon number density within the region of width @xmath22 ( rather than the @xmath55 appearing in eq .",
    "[ taueqn ] ) . because the number density within the shock is smaller than @xmath55 , eq .",
    "[ taueqn ] represents a lower bound on @xmath54 ( or an upper limit on the influence of @xmath56 scatterings ) .",
    "pion energy loss via coulomb scattering off the background electrons is given by the bethe - bloch formula for ionization losses ( see @xcite ) , with the ionization potential for completely ionized material equal to @xmath57 .",
    "here @xmath58 is the electron plasma frequency , and @xmath59 is the electron number density . neglecting an unimportant ( for our applications ) logarithmic dependence on @xmath59 , pion energy loss via coulomb scattering is given by @xmath60 .",
    "the timescale for energy loss via @xmath61 scatterings is then @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the pion lorentz factor as measured in the shocked fluid frame .",
    "when strong scatterings are inefficient at cooling the pions , the temperature in the shocked plasma is generally too low for efficient pair @xmath17 production . in this case @xmath64 and @xmath61 interactions are at most only as important as strong scatterings .",
    "pion energy loss via bremsstrahlung and pair production is not important for pion energies less than about 100 gev @xcite .",
    "pions lose energy to the background photon and magnetic fields at a rate @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the thomson cross section , @xmath67 is the pion mass , and @xmath68 is the energy density in the photon and magnetic fields . a cooling time @xmath69 can be defined as @xmath70 .",

    "by contrast , for shocks at large radii ( @xmath73 ) when the protons are accelerated to high energies via plasma processes , typical pions produced in photomeson interactions have lorentz factors of @xmath74 , and synchrotron cooling is more important than strong scattering .    in the shocked plasma rest frame",

    ". [ detectionrate ] , @xmath123 does not depend explicitly on the beaming angle of emitted neutrinos .",

    "if the opposite case holds ( @xmath126 ) , then those neutrinos emitted outside of the photon beaming angle are effectively lost to observation and the detection rate is effectively decreased by a factor of @xmath127 .",
    "two competing processes affect @xmath128 : the focusing of an initially wide jet as the jet propagates through the star @xcite , and the expansion of the high enthalpy jet as it breaks free of the star @xcite .",

    "[ detectionrate ] and the detection rates estimated for gev neutrinos from grbs neglect many of the experimental difficulties associated with detecting these neutrinos . as noted in the introduction , the detector phototube spacing must be small enough to allow detection of @xmath131 muons with @xmath132 pathlengths ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the angle of the incident neutrino relative to the grb must be sufficiently well known to distinguish a grb neutrino from the background atmospheric neutrinos .",

    "numerical simulations of the propagation of a relativistic jet through a stellar envelope indicate that , deep within the star , instabilities along the jet - stellar wall interface slow the jet .",
    "this slowing gives rise to a variation in the lorentz factor of an initially uniform jet .",
    "as we have shown , the slowing of neutrons within the jet also gives rise to an interesting and potentially detectable neutrino signal .",
    "neutrinos produced during the slowing of the jet can precede grb photons by tens to several tens of seconds , depending on the jet dynamics and stellar progenitor .",
    "by contrast , neutrinos produced in a jet that is not subsequently dramatically slowed arrive within @xmath140 seconds of the grb photons , where @xmath141 is the radius where the jet shocks and produces observed photons .",
    "the observation of gev neutrinos preceding a grb flash by @xmath142 seconds would be an indication that a relativistic jet had been slowed while optically thick . in turn , this could imply that the jet had punched through a stellar envelope .",
    "slowing of the jet within the star also has an impact on the jet composition . this is because neutron - neutron collisions , which dominate the slowing of neutrons if the jet is neutron rich , preferentially produce protons .",
    "near threshold , for example , roughly @xmath143 of the inelastic nn(pp ) cross section goes toward the production of a p(n ) @xcite .",
    "a jet born near the central black hole with a very low electron fraction will arrive at large radii with @xmath144 .",
    "this will influence subsequent nucleosynthesis in the jet @xcite , as well as the production of neutrinos by inelastic nuclear processes at large radii .",
