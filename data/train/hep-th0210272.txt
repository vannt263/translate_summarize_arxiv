    "the holographic principle is perhaps one of fundamental principles of nature , which relates a theory with gravity in @xmath0 dimensions to a theory without gravity in lower dimensions  @xcite .",
    "although we do not yet completely understand how the hologram of gravity is realized , some beautiful examples have been found through the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .    in a seminal paper",
    "@xcite , e. verlinde found a quite interesting holographic relation between the friedmann equation describing a radiation - dominated , closed friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe and cardy formula  @xcite describing the entropy of matter filling the universe .",
    "the radiation can be represented by a conformal field theory ( cft ) with a large central charge , while the entropy for the latter can be expressed in terms of the so - called cardy - verlinde formula  @xcite , a generalized form of the cardy formula to any dimension .",
    "the cardy - verlinde formula was checked to hold for cfts with ads gravity dual , for instance , for cfts dual to schwarzschild - ads black holes  @xcite , kerr - ads black holes  @xcite , hyperbolic ads black holes and charged ads black holes  @xcite , taub - bolt ads instanton solutions  @xcite , and kerr - newman - ads black holes  @xcite .",
    "verlinde found that the friedmann equation can be rewritten in the form of the cardy - verlinde formula with the help of three cosmological entropy bounds , and that when the hubble entropy bound is saturated , the friedmann equation coincides with the cardy - verlinde formula .",
    "this observation is very interesting in the sense that the friedmann equation is a dynamic one describing geometric evolution of the universe while the cardy - verlinde formula is just a formula describing the number of degrees of freedom of matter in the universe .",
    "therefore , the verlinde s observation is indeed an interesting manifestation of the holographic principle in the cosmological setting .    by considering a moving brane universe in the background of schwarzschild - ads black holes in arbitrary dimensions , the holographic connection between the geometry and matter can be realized .",
    "a radiation - dominated closed frw universe appears as an induced metric on the brane embedded in the bulk background .",
    "savonije and verlinde  @xcite interpreted the radiation as the thermal cft dual to the bulk schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "further they observed that when the brane crosses the bulk black hole horizon , ( i ) the entropy and temperature of the universe can be simply expressed in terms of the hubble parameter and its time derivative ; ( ii ) the entropy formula ( cardy - verlinde formula ) of cfts in any dimension coincides with the friedmann equation ; and ( iii ) the hubble entropy bound is just saturated by the bekenstein - hawking entropy of bulk black holes .",
    "since then a lot of studies have been done focusing on the generalization of @xcite to various bulk geometries . in this paper , we are interested in the case where a positive cosmological constant is present in the universe",
    ". namely we will discuss the holography for a radiation - dominated closed frw universe with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "this is motivated partially by the de sitter ( ds)/cft correspondence  @xcite , and partially by recent astronomical observations on supernova indicating that our universe is accelerating  @xcite , which can be interpreted as that there might be a positive cosmological constant in our universe .",
    "we will start with a brief review on the case without the cosmological constant  @xcite in the next section , and then discuss the holography in the case with a positive cosmological constant by introducing a cosmological d - bound on the entropy of matter in the universe . as an example , in sec .",
    "iii we investigate the holographic connection between the friedmann equation and the cardy - verlinde formula in the brane cosmology in the background of schwarzschild - de sitter black holes .",
    "we end this paper in sec .",
    "iv with some conclusions and discussions .",
    "let us consider an @xmath1-dimensional closed frw universe @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath4 denotes the line element of an @xmath5-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "the evolution of the universe is determined by the frw equations @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents the hubble parameter with the definition @xmath8 and the overdot stands for derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the energy of matter filling the universe , @xmath11 is the pressure , @xmath12 is the volume of the universe , @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the volume of an @xmath5-dimensional unit sphere , and @xmath15 is the newton constant in ( @xmath16 ) dimensions . in addition",
    ", @xmath17 is related to the cosmological constant @xmath18 in ( @xmath16 ) dimensions .      in @xcite verlinde",
    "introduced three entropy bounds .",
    "so we call this the bekenstein - verlinde bound .",
    "this bound could be viewed as the counterpart of the bekenstein bound in the cosmological setting  @xcite . ] : @xmath19 the bekenstein - verlinde entropy bound is supposed to hold for a weakly self - gravitating universe ( @xmath20 ) , while the hubble entropy bound works when the universe is in the strongly self - gravitating phase ( @xmath21 ) . in the case without the cosmological constant , the friedmann equation [ the first equation in ( [ 2eq2 ] ) ] can be rewritten as @xmath22 in terms of those three entropy bounds .",
    "expression ( [ 2eq4 ] ) is similar to the cardy formula  @xcite , an entropy formula of cfts in two dimensions .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath23 , one has @xmath24 .",
    "let us define a quantity @xmath25 which corresponds to energy needed to form a black hole with size of the whole universe through the relation : @xmath26",
    ". with this quantity , the friedmann equation ( [ 2eq4 ] ) can be further cast to @xmath27 which takes the same form as the cardy - verlinde formula  @xcite @xmath28 this formula is supposed to describe the entropy @xmath29 of a cft living on an @xmath5-sphere of radius @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the total energy of the cft and @xmath30 stands for the casimir energy of the system , the non - extensive part of the total energy .",
    "now we suppose that the entropy of the radiation matter in the frw universe can be described by the cardy - verlinde formula . comparing ( [ 2eq5 ] ) with ( [ 2eq6 ] )",
    ", one can easily see that if @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath29 must be equal .",
    "in other words , the hubble entropy bound is saturated by the entropy of radiation matter in the universe if the casimir energy @xmath30 is just enough to form a black hole with the size of the universe . at that moment ,",
    "equations ( [ 2eq5 ] ) and ( [ 2eq6 ] ) coincide with each other .",
    "this implies that the friedmann equation somehow knows the entropy formula of radiation - matter filling the universe  @xcite .",
    "considering a brane universe in the background of schwarzschild - ads black holes , savonije and verlinde  @xcite found that when the brane crosses the black hole horizon , the hubble entropy bound is saturated by the entropy of black holes in the bulk .    in eq .",
    "( [ 2eq6 ] ) the casimir energy @xmath30 is defined as  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for the temperature of the thermal cft , @xmath11 is the pressure and @xmath12 is the volume of the system .",
    "further verlinde found that except for the similarity between the friedmann equation ( [ 2eq5 ] ) and the cardy - verlinde formula ( [ 2eq6 ] ) , there is also a similarity between the second equation in ( [ 2eq2 ] ) concerning the time derivative of hubble parameter and the equation ( [ 2eq7 ] ) about the casimir energy of cfts .",
    "let us define a ( limiting ) temperature @xmath35 here the minus sign is necessary to get a positive result .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that we are in the strongly self - gravitating phase with @xmath21 so that @xmath36 and @xmath37 is well - defined . with this temperature , the second equation in ( [ 2eq2 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath38 thus we see that when the hubble bound @xmath32 is saturated by the matter entropy @xmath29 , the ( limiting ) temperature @xmath37 equals the thermodynamic temperature @xmath34 of matter filling the universe .",
    "note that like the hubble entropy bound , the ( limiting ) temperature @xmath37 is a geometric quantity determined by the hubble parameter and its time derivative .",
    "clearly the temperature @xmath37 is the minimal one in the strongly self - gravitating phase  @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the case with a non - vanishing cosmological constant , and generalize those interesting observations to a radiation - dominated closed frw universe with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "we will argue that three cosmological entropy bounds in ( [ 2eq3 ] ) remain the same forms even when a cosmological constant is present .    to write down a formula like ( [ 2eq4 ] ) ,",
    "let us first discuss three entropy bounds in ( [ 2eq3 ] ) .",
    "the bekenstein - verlinde bound @xmath39 is the counterpart of the bekenstein entropy bound  @xcite in the cosmological setting  @xcite .",
    "it is supposed to hold for a system with limited self - gravity , which means that the gravitational self - energy of the system is small compared to the total energy @xmath10 .",
    "namely , the gravitational effect on the bound can be neglected .",
    "therefore this bound is independent of gravity theories .",
    "it is also independent of whether or not the gravity theory under consideration includes a cosmological constant . in other words ,",
    "the form of the bekenstein - verlinde bound should remain unchanged in any gravitational theory independent of gravity theories by applying a geroch process to an arbitrary black hole . ] .",
    "hence even when a positive cosmological constant is present , the bekenstein - verlinde bound still takes the form in ( [ 2eq3 ] ) . as a result , for a radiation - dominated frw universe with a cosmological constant ,",
    "the bekenstein - verlinde bound is a constant because of @xmath40 .",
    "thus once this bound is satisfied at one time , it will be always satisfied at all times if the entropy @xmath29 of matter does not change .",
    "as for the bekenstein - hawking bound in ( [ 2eq3 ] ) , it can be viewed as the holographic bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole with the size of the universe  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it varies like an area instead of the volume . and",
    "for a closed universe it is the closest one that can lead to the usual area formula of black hole entropy @xmath41 .",
    "we know from the thermodynamics of black holes that in einstein gravity the entropy of a black hole is always proportional to its horizon area in spite of whether or not the gravitational theory includes a cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "further , as argued by verlinde  @xcite , the role of @xmath42 is not to serve as a bound on the total entropy , but rather on a sub - extensive component of the entropy that is associated with the casimir energy of cfts .",
    "the above leads to the conclusion that the bekenstein - hawking bound should remain unchanged in its form and implication as in the case without the cosmological constant .",
    "finally we consider the hubble entropy bound , which is an entropy bound for matter in a strongly self - gravitating universe @xmath43 ) .",
    "in such a strongly self - gravitating universe , black holes might occur .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the maximal entropy inside the universe is produced by black holes with size of the hubble horizon .",
    "the usual holographic argument shows that the total entropy should be less than or equal to the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a hubble - horizon - sized black hole times the number of hubble regions in the universe . in @xcite , by using a local holographic bound due to fischler and susskind  @xcite and bousso  @xcite , see also @xcite , verlinde ",
    "derived \" the hubble entropy bound in ( [ 2eq3 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in the  derivation \" of the hubble bound , verlinde used mainly the idea that the entropy flow @xmath29 through a contracting light sheet is less than or equal to @xmath41 , where @xmath44 is the area of the surface from which the light sheet originates .",
    "hence we insist that the cosmological constant will not affect the form of the hubble bound ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion is based on the fact that even if a cosmological constant is present , it will not occur explicitly in the  derivation \" of the hubble entropy bound .",
    "we conclude that in a closed frw universe with a cosmological constant , three bounds introduced in ( [ 2eq3 ] ) are still applicable .",
    "that is , their forms and implications remain unchanged even if the cosmological constant is present .",
    "however , we see that the cosmological constant indeed affects the evolution of the universe .",
    "is there a similar relation between the friedmann equation in ( [ 2eq2 ] ) and the cardy - verlinde formula ( [ 2eq6 ] ) as in the case without the cosmological constant ?",
    "our key observation is that the positive cosmological constant provides an additional entropy measure .",
    "when the cosmological constant occurs , not the hubble bound , but a new cosmological d - bound plays the role as the hubble bound does in the case without the cosmological constant .",
    "let us go to the details .",
    "we know that in a pure de sitter universe , there is a cosmological horizon for an inertial observer . like a black hole horizon ,",
    "the cosmological horizon has a hawking temperature and an associated entropy  @xcite .",
    "the entropy is proportional to the area of the cosmological horizon .",
    "it is a geometric quantity although it has a statistical origin in quantum gravity . in an asymptotically de sitter space ,",
    "the cosmological horizon shrinks . applying the generalized second law of thermodynamics  @xcite to the cosmological horizon",
    ", one can immediately find that the entropy of matter in the asymptotically de sitter space has to be bounded above by the difference ( d ) between the entropy of the pure de sitter space and the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the asymptotically de sitter space : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath44 are areas of cosmological horizons for the pure de sitter and asymptotically de sitter spaces , respectively .",
    "this is the so - called d - bound proposed by bousso in @xcite .",
    "the d - bound is closely related to the bekenstein bound which applies in flat backgrounds  @xcite .    in our present context",
    ", the occurrence of the cosmological constant does not guarantee that the universe approaches to a de sitter phase . when the matter is dominated , the universe behaves as the case without the cosmological constant : the universe starts from a big bang , reaches a maximal radius and then re - collapses with a big crunch . from ( [ 2eq2 ] ) , however , we see that for an empty flat universe , and the term @xmath47 will be also absent . ]",
    ", the hubble radius is just the cosmological horizon size @xmath48 of de sitter space .",
    "it implies that the cosmological constant provides a new entropy measure in the universe .",
    "by analogy with the hubble entropy bound  @xcite , we define a quantity @xmath49 which is the entropy of a de sitter horizon times the number of the regions with the size of the de sitter horizon in the universe . like the hubble entropy bound , it is also a geometric quantity . together with the three entropy bounds in ( [ 2eq3 ] ) , the friedmann equation in ( [ 2eq2 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath50 further we note that the cosmological horizon in the asymptotically de sitter spaces is always less that of corresponding de sitter spaces , but one can see from ( [ 2eq2 ] ) that the hubble radius @xmath51 is not always less than the cosmological horizon @xmath48 of de sitter spaces . as a result , the left - hand side of equation ( [ 2eq12 ] ) is not always positive .",
    "in addition , we stress that in the case without the cosmological constant , the hubble bound in ( [ 2eq5 ] ) is a geometric quantity , which gives an entropy bound of matter in the universe when the universe is in the strongly self - gravitating phase .",
    "considering the d - bound ( [ 2eq10 ] ) of matter in de sitter spaces and the similarity between ( [ 2eq4 ] ) and ( [ 2eq12 ] ) , we can define a cosmological entropy bound in the universe with a positive cosmological constant . as a result , if @xmath52 , a cosmological singularity might occur during the evolution of the universe . ]",
    "@xmath53 we call it the cosmological d - bound , which can be viewed as the counterpart of the d - bound in the cosmology setting .",
    "note that the cosmological d - bound is a square root of the difference between two geometric quantity squares , while the d - bound in de sitter spaces is the difference between two geometric quantities .",
    "furthermore , we would like to mention here that the implications of these two entropy bounds are quite different .",
    "the d - bound ( [ 2eq10 ] ) is an entropy bound where the entropy is measurable to an inertial observer in the de sitter space(recall the inertial observer can see only a _",
    "part _ of the de sitter space  @xcite ) , while the cosmological d - bound ( [ 2eq13 ] ) is supposed to be an entropy bound of matter filling the _ whole universe _ with a positive cosmological constant when the universe is in the strongly self - gravitating phase .",
    "therefore , more precisely , the cosmological d - bound should be regarded as the counterpart of the hubble entropy bound @xmath32 in the case with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "this can be seen clearly after comparing ( [ 2eq4 ] ) and ( [ 2eq12 ] ) . with the choice ( [ 2eq13 ] ) , the friedmann equation can be cast to the cardy - verlinde form even when the cosmological constant is present .    on the analogy of the ( limiting ) temperature @xmath37 in ( [ 2eq8 ] )",
    ", we further define a new geometric temperature in our case @xmath54 note that this is also a geometric quantity like @xmath37 for the case without the cosmological constant . with this , the second equation in ( [ 2eq2 ] )",
    "can be expressed as @xmath55 here the definition of @xmath25 is the same as the one in ( [ 2eq5 ] ) . like the limiting temperature @xmath37",
    ", the geometric temperature @xmath56 will equal the thermodynamic temperature of matter filling the universe when the cosmological d - bound gets saturated .",
    "that is , @xmath56 is the lower bound of thermodynamic temperature during the universe is in the strongly self - gravitating phase .",
    "now we turn to the cardy - verlinde formula ( [ 2eq6 ] ) . in the form ( [ 2eq6 ] )",
    "it is implicitly assumed that one has @xmath57 for any cft .",
    "in fact , in some circumstances , this condition does not get satisfied .",
    "for example , in the cft description dual to the thermodynamics of schwarzschild - de sitter black hole horizon , this quantity is negative  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the cardy - verlinde formula should be changed to @xmath58 where the definition of @xmath30 is still the same as the one ( [ 2eq7 ] ) .    in summary , for a radiation - dominated closed frw universe with a positive cosmological constant",
    "the dynamic equations can be rewritten as @xmath59 when @xmath60 , while the entropy of the radiation can be expressed as @xmath61 on the other hand , when @xmath62 , the dynamic equations can be rewritten as @xmath63 and the entropy expressions are @xmath64 when the cosmological d - bound is saturated by the entropy @xmath29 of radiation matter , both sets of equations ( [ 2eq17 ] ) [ or ( [ 2eq19 ] ) ] and ( [ 2eq18 ] ) [ or ( [ 2eq20 ] ) ] coincide with each other , just like the case without the cosmological constant .",

    "since the brane is viewed as the boundary of the bulk spacetime , the entropy of holographic matter ( radiation ) on the brane is just the entropy of black hole horizon , which is a constant during the evolution of the brane universe .",
    "however , the entropy density varies with time as @xmath164 and the energy density of radiation - matter @xmath165 in terms of the black hole horizon radius @xmath74 .",
    "further from the scaling relation ( [ 3eq29 ] ) , the temperature @xmath34 on the brane is given by @xmath166 applying the first law of thermodynamics to the radiation matter in the brane universe , one has @xmath167 following @xcite and defining @xmath168 we have @xmath169 obviously , the non - vanishing @xmath170 is the effect of spatial curvature @xmath47 .",
    "that is , because of the spatial curvature , the energy of thermodynamics system has a non - extensive part . otherwise , the quantity @xmath170 must vanish due to the euler relation . from ( [ 3eq32 ] ) , one can see that @xmath170 is just the first term of the energy density ( [ 3eq32 ] ) divided by @xmath47 .",
    "further one can find that the entropy density ( [ 3eq31 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath171 now we consider a special moment that the brane crosses the bulk black hole horizon . on that time",
    ", one has @xmath172 . from ( [ 3eq11 ] )",
    "we see @xmath173 note that we have taken @xmath174 . at that moment",
    "the cosmological d - bound in ( [ 2eq13 ] ) turns out to be @xmath175 which is just the black hole horizon entropy ( [ 3eq2 ] ) .",
    "that is , when the brane crosses the bulk black hole horizon , the cosmological d - bound is saturated by the entropy of the bulk black hole . at that time , the geometric temperature in ( [ 2eq14 ] ) is given by @xmath176 which equals the temperature ( [ 3eq33 ] ) of radiation filling the universe .",
    "thus , we find that when the brane crosses the black hole horizon , the frw equations ( [ 2eq19 ] ) coincide with the equations ( [ 3eq37 ] ) and ( [ 3eq36 ] ) which describe the entropy of radiation matter in the brane universe with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "thus we reach the same conclusion as in the case without the cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "we have discussed the holography in a radiation - dominated , closed frw universe with a positive cosmological constant . by introducing the cosmological d - bound ( [ 2eq13 ] ) on the entropy of matter in the universe , the friedmann equation describing the evolution of the universe can be rewritten in the form of cardy - verlinde formula which describes the degrees of freedom of radiation matter filling the universe . when the cosmological d - bound is saturated by the entropy of matter , these two equations coincide with each other .",
    "thus we have successfully generalized interesting observations by verlinde  @xcite on the holographic connection between the friedmann equation and cardy - verlinde formula to the case with a positive cosmological constant . by considering a brane universe in the background of schwarzschild - de sitter black holes , we have found that the cosmological d - bound is saturated when the brane crosses the black hole horizon in the bulk background . at that moment , the friedmann equation and cardy - verlinde formula coincide with each other , and the introduced geometric temperature @xmath56 in ( [ 2eq14 ] ) equals the thermodynamic temperature @xmath34 of the radiation matter .",
    "we stress that when discussing the holographic connection in the brane universe in the schwarzschild - de sitter black holes , we have taken a special tension ( [ 3eq27 ] ) , which is the same as in the case for critical brane in the ads bulk . only in that case , the friedmann equation and cardy - verlinde formula coincide with each other very well .",
    "we point out here that if the brane tension is arbitrary , the friedmann equation still has a form as the cardy - verlinde formula , but a factor @xmath177 will appear in ( [ 3eq37 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for the radiation matter dual to the black holes in de sitter spaces , we see from ( [ 3eq37 ] ) that @xmath178 .",
    "if considering a non - critical brane cosmology in the schwarzschild - ads black holes , one will see that in that case @xmath179 .",
    "this case corresponds to the holographic connection described by equations ( [ 2eq17 ] ) and ( [ 2eq18 ] ) .",
    "in addition , if the cosmological constant becomes negative , the minus sign in front of @xmath180 has to be changed to plus .",
    "the quantity ( [ 2eq11 ] ) then will lose its interpretation , but all formulas will still work well .",
    "we have noticed that the holography was discussed in many literatures in the case with a cosmological constant , for example , see @xcite .",
    "however , our understanding is different from those in existing literature : in some papers the cosmological constant term is incorporated to the bekenstein - verlinde entropy bound ; in some papers this term is kept as an independent term . in those literature the friedmann equation and the cardy - verlinde formula have not a same form , and when the hubble bound is saturated , these two formulas do not get matched .",
    "finally we point out that at the end of paper  @xcite , verlinde mentioned that when the cosmological constant does not vanish , the hubble entropy bound needs to be modified by replacing @xmath7 with the square root of @xmath181 .",
    "but , as argued in this paper , three entropy bounds : bekenstein - verlinde bound , bekenstein - hawking bound and hubble bound in ( [ 2eq3 ] ) still have the same forms as the case without the cosmological constant , even when the cosmological constant is present .",
    "the cosmological d - bound introduced in this work provides a new entropy bound of matter in the strongly self - gravitating universe ( @xmath182 ) with a positive cosmological constant and makes all formulas work so nicely as the case without the cosmological constant .",
