    "extremely low mass ( elm ) wds , with masses @xmath40.3 m@xmath5 , are the remnants of stars that never ignited helium in their cores .",

    "observational data for elm wds is limited , however , because of their rarity .",
    "for example , among the 9316 wds identified in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , fewer than 0.2% have masses below 0.3 m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have established a radial velocity program to search for companions around known elm wds .",
    "of the six elm wds observed to date  including j0917 + 4638 , the lowest mass wd known @xcite  all six elm wds are in binaries with @xmath21 day orbital periods .",
    "two more recently identified elm wds , nltt 11748 and j1257 + 5428 @xcite , are also in binaries with @xmath41 day orbital periods @xcite .",
    "three of these eight elm wds will merge due to gravitational wave radiation in less than 500 myr @xcite . a larger sample of elm wds is required to measure the space density , period distribution , and merger rate of these systems .",
    "here we present 12 elm wds with @xmath7  found in the hypervelocity star ( hvs ) survey of @xcite , ten of which are new discoveries .",
    "our elm wd sample is unique because it comes from a complete , non - kinematically - selected survey of stars targeted in a well - defined range of apparent magnitude and color .",
    "radial velocity follow - up reveals that 11 of the 12 elm wds are binaries with @xmath414 hr orbital periods . clearly , the compact binary formation scenario is the best explanation for elm wds .    in section 2",
    "we describe the survey design and the spectroscopic observations . in section 3",
    "we derive the physical parameters of the elm wds with stellar atmosphere modeling , and present the radial velocity curves for each object . in section 4",
    "we discuss the nature of the binary systems , and conclude in section 5 .",

    "the final part extends the earlier surveys over 9800 deg@xmath10 of the sdss data release 7 footprint and also extends the magnitude limit to @xmath12 ( dotted line ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "the final part of the hvs survey is currently 88% complete .",

    "all observations are paired with a comparison lamp exposure .",
    "we process the spectra using iraf in the standard way .",
    "we flux - calibrate using blue spectrophotometric standards @xcite , and we measure radial velocities using the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "it is important to maximize velocity precision in our tests for variability , and we achieve the best precision by cross - correlating the elm wds with themselves .",
    "our procedure begins by cross - correlating the observed spectra with a high signal - to - noise wd template to obtain preliminary velocities .",
    "we then shift the spectra to the rest frame , and sum them together to create templates for each target . finally , we cross - correlate the spectra with the appropriate template to obtain the final velocities for each target .",
    "the average radial velocity uncertainty of the measurements is @xmath14 km s@xmath13 .",
    "we check our velocities using wd model spectra with atmospheric parameters customized for each target .",
    "the results are consistent within 10 km s@xmath13 , which we take as our systematic uncertainty .",
    "table [ tab : dat ] in the appendix presents the full set of radial velocity measurements for the 10 newly discovered elm wds presented here .",

    "follow - up spectroscopy of j0917 + 4638 and j1053 + 5200 is already published @xcite , but the other elm wds in our sample have not been studied until now .      we perform stellar atmosphere model fits using synthetic da wd spectra kindly provided by d.  koester .",
    "the grid of wd model atmospheres covers effective temperatures from 6000 k to 30,000 k in steps of 500 k to 2000 k , and surface gravities from @xmath15 5.0 to 9.0 in steps of 0.25 dex .",
    "the model atmospheres are calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and include both convective and radiative transport @xcite .",

    "the surface gravities range 5.16.9 dex at effective temperatures of 1040018300 k , confirming that the objects are elm wds .",
    "we fit the flux - calibrated spectral continua to better measure effective temperature .",
    "the exception is j2119@xmath30018 , the one elm wd we observed under variable conditions and at high airmass , for which we fit the continuum - corrected spectrum .",
    "if we fit only the continuum - corrected balmer line profiles for all the elm wds , we obtain best - fit solutions that differ by @xmath18 k in @xmath19 and @xmath20 dex in @xmath21 from our published values .",
    "these differences reflect our systematic error , and demonstrate that our fits to the entire flux - calibrated spectra are reasonably accurate .",
    "our fits also agree well with the sdss photometry in all five filters , an additional demonstration that our temperature and surface gravity measurements are reliable .",
    "figure [ fig : teff ] compares the observed elm wds and other wds in the hvs survey with the improved @xcite tracks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for he - core wds with masses 0.160.45  and the @xcite tracks for normal co - core wds with masses 0.51 .",
    "the gap between the 0.17  and 0.18  he - core wd tracks is linked to the threshold for thermonuclear flashes in the hydrogen shell burning phase @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the majority of observed elm wds fall in the gap of parameter space between the 0.17  and 0.18  models .    the inconsistency between the observations and the he - core wd models make accurate mass and luminosity estimates difficult . fortunately , mass and luminosity change slowly over the range of effective temperature and surface gravity sampled by our elm wds .",
    "we conclude that the majority of the elm wds have a mass of @xmath60.17  and an absolute magnitudes of @xmath22 ; more precise estimates are possible for the 0.20 - 0.25  elm wds and are summarized in table [ tab : param ] .    using these absolute magnitude estimates ,",

    "all of our elm wds are located at high galactic latitudes @xmath24 in the sdss imaging footprint .",
    "the systemic velocities suggest that two objects are halo wds : j0818 + 3536 and j1422 + 4352 have systemic heliocentric radial velocities of @xmath25   and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "@xcite also identify j1053 + 5200 as a halo object based on its proper motion and distance estimate .",
    "unfortunately , reliable proper motions are unavailable for our fainter @xmath27 wds . despite having relatively large @xmath28 kpc distances above the galactic plane , the remaining elm wds in our sample",
    "have systemic radial velocities consistent with a disk origin .",
    "eleven of our twelve elm wds exhibit significant radial velocity variation , with peak - to - peak velocity amplitudes up to 890 .",
    "we compute orbital periods for these systems by finding the period that minimizes @xmath29 for a circular orbit .",
    "figure [ fig : pdm ] plots the periodograms for the 10 new elm wds .",
    "a few elm wds have multiple period solutions because of insufficient coverage , however in all cases the periods are constrained to be @xmath41 day .",
    "we estimate the period error by conservatively identifying the range of periods with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the minimum @xmath29 .",
    "we compute best - fit orbital elements using the code of @xcite , which weights each velocity measurement by its associated error .",
    "the uncertainties in the orbital elements are derived from the covariance matrix and @xmath29 . to verify these uncertainty estimates ,",
    "we perform a monte carlo analysis where we replace the measured radial velocity @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the error in @xmath32 and @xmath35 is a gaussian deviate with zero mean and unit variance . for each of 10000 sets of modified radial velocities ,",
    "we repeat the periodogram analysis and derive new orbital elements .",
    "we adopt the inter - quartile range in the period and orbital elements as the uncertainty . for binaries with multiple period aliases ,",
    "both approaches yield similar uncertainties .",
    "when there are several equally plausible periods , the monte carlo analysis selects all possible periods and derives very large uncertainties . in these cases ,",

    "additional observations are required to determine the nature of this elm wd .",
    "sdss j151225.70 + 261538.5 is a binary with a best - fit orbital period of @xmath191 hr , and a significant period alias at 17.8 hrs . assuming the best - fit period",

    "for the most probable inclination angle @xmath167 , the companion is a 0.36  low mass wd at orbital separation of 2.5 .",
    "sdss j163026.09 + 271226.5 has a best - fit orbital period of @xmath192 hr .",
    "the observations also allow for 5.16 and 9.17 hr periods . assuming the best - fit period ,",
    "there is a 77% probability that the companion is a wd with @xmath41.4  and a 11% probability that the companion is a neutron star with 1.4 - 3.0 . for the most probable inclination angle @xmath167 , the companion is a normal 0.70  wd at an orbital separation of 1.7 .",
    "sdss j211921.96@xmath3001825.8 is the second lowest surface gravity wd known , with @xmath193 . as with j1233 + 1602 , j2119@xmath30018",
    "s orbital parameters exclude the possibility of it being a main sequence a star .",
    "j2119@xmath30018 is a binary with a @xmath194 hr orbital period and a mass function of @xmath195 .",
    "if the primary is 2.5  main sequence star , its companion must be @xmath1022.2  at an orbital separation of 1.4 .",
    "this separation is smaller than the radius of main sequence stars .",
    "we do not see any evidence of a companion in our spectra .",
    "thus j2119@xmath30018 must be a @xmath60.17  wd .    given the observed orbital parameters , there is a 64% probability that the companion is a wd with @xmath41.4  and a 18% probability that the companion is a neutron star with 1.4 - 3.0 . assuming the most probable orbital inclination angle of @xmath172 , j2119@xmath30018 s companion is a 1.04  wd at an orbital separation of 0.9 .",
    "follow - up radio or x - ray observations are required to rule out a neutron star companion , but the companion is most likely a massive wd .",
    "this system will merge in less than 540 myr .",
    "there is a 5% likelihood that the system contains a pair of wds whose total mass exceeds the chandrasekhar mass and thus will explode as a type ia supernova .",
    "however , the extreme mass ratio @xmath196 suggests that mass transfer will be stable and this binary will likely evolve into an am cvn system .",
    "we present a complete sample of 12 elm wds with masses @xmath7  in the hvs survey .",
    "eleven of the wds are binary systems with orbital periods @xmath414 hr ; j1448 + 1342 is the only wd for which we detect no velocity variation . given the binary nature of the other wds in our non - kinematically selected sample , j1448 + 1342 is quite possibly a pole - on system .",
    "our observations demonstrate that the formation of @xmath00.25  elm wds requires close binary evolution @xcite .",
    "two of our targets , j1233 + 1602 and j2119@xmath30018 , have surface gravities lower than the previous record - holder j0917 + 4638 @xcite and thus are the lowest surface gravity wds currently known .",
    "interestingly , all three of these low surface gravity elm wds exhibit strong ca absorption in their spectra .",
    "the ca is likely explained by on - going accretion from circumbinary disks .",
    "other sources of accretion are much less likely , given the extremely short timescale for gravitational settling in the elm wd photospheres and their 1 - 2 kpc distances above the disk plane .",
    "one possible source of circumbinary disk accretion is debris from former planetary systems @xcite . for the case of our elm wd binaries ,",
    "the systems must have had circumbinary planets that could survive the binary common envelope evolution .",
    "common envelope evolution may also lead to `` second generation '' planet formation @xcite , the debris of which may be accreting onto the elm wds . in any case ,",
    "the lowest surface gravity elm wds are interesting targets for future infrared observations .",
    "six of our 12 elm wds ( 50% ) will merge within a hubble time ( we exclude j1448 + 1342 due to its unknown period ) ; four of these mergers will happen in @xmath0600 myr . in all cases",
    "the most likely binary companions are wds , although neutron stars can not be ruled out based on the available data .",
    "two of the merger systems , j0818 + 3536 and j1053 + 5200 , are likely to have unusually low - mass ( @xmath40.4 ) wd companions and thus are possible progenitors for single helium - enriched sdo stars @xcite .",
    "four of the merger systems are likely to have c / o wd companions and thus will likely form extreme helium stars . however ,",
    "three of the systems ( j0755 + 4906 , j1233 + 1602 , and j2119@xmath30018 ) have such extreme mass ratios @xmath20.23 that future mass transfer is likely to be stable and thus they will evolve into am cvn systems .    we expect that at least one of our elm wds has @xmath197 and thus is an eclipsing system .",
    "@xcite recently discovered the first eclipsing detached double wd ; finding eclipsing wd binaries in our sample will provide important mass - radius constraints on he core elm wd models .",
    "the most probable eclipsing candidates in our sample are the systems with the shortest merger times , namely j0923 + 3028 , j1053 + 5200 , j0755 + 4906 , and j2119@xmath30018 .",
    "our sample of 12 elm wds is unique in terms of its non - kinematic selection and its completeness .",
    "previous discoveries of elm wds in the sdss @xcite and other surveys @xcite have been useful for studying the formation and future evolution of the individual systems @xcite",
    ". however , the spectroscopic selection biases present in the sdss prohibit an accurate estimate of the space density of these objects .",
    "sdss wds were observed by different targeting programs selected with different color , magnitude , and photometric quality cuts as well as different sparse sampling rates that vary over the sdss survey region @xcite .",
    "our sample , on the other hand , is complete in magnitude , color , and spatial coverage and enables us to estimate the space density and merger rate of elm wds in the milky way .",
