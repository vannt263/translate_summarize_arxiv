    "the polynuclear growth ( png ) model is the best - studied growth model from the kpz class in one spatial dimension . since in one dimension the dynamical scaling exponent is @xmath1 , the correlation length increases as @xmath2 for large growth time @xmath3 .",
    "the exponent is universal , but different classes of initial conditions lead to distinct scale invariant statistical properties of the surface in the large @xmath3 limit . to go beyond the exponents and to determine the exact scaling functions one has to analyze some solvable models . in this paper",
    "we consider the png model .",
    "the surface height at time @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 . on the surface",
    "new islands of height one are created at random with intensity @xmath5 .",
    "the islands spread with unit speed and simply merge upon contact .    for the png model",
    "the exact scaling function for stationary growth is known , see  @xcite , relying on previous results by baik and rains  @xcite . in the case",
    "where initially @xmath6 and nucleations are constrained to occur only above a first spreading layer , the surface has typically the shape of a droplet . in this geometry , for fixed but large @xmath3 , the spatial statistics of the surface is well understood .",
    "subtracting the deterministic part , it is proved in  @xcite that the self - similar shape fluctuations are governed by the airy process .    in numerical simulations , one starts the growth process mostly with a flat substrate , i.e. , @xmath6 with no further constraints .",
    "thus it would be of interest to understand the statistics of @xmath4 at large @xmath3 .",
    "it is a space translation invariant process and the only available result  @xcite is the one - point distribution , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the goe tracy - widom distribution ( here @xmath9 ) . the limiting function @xmath8 is linked to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrix theory as follows .",
    "let us denote by @xmath10 the largest eigenvalue of a @xmath11 goe matrix , in units where @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 see  @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 is given in terms of a fredholm determinant , compare ( [ eq2.8b ] ) below .",
    "a plot of @xmath14 in semi - logarithmic scale is available in  @xcite .",
    "the result ( [ eq1.2 ] ) leaves open the joint distribution at two space points , even more the full process with respect to @xmath15 . from the general kpz scaling theory , see  @xcite for an exposition , a meaningful limit is expected only if the two points are separated by a distance of order @xmath2 .",
    "thus the issue is to determine the limit @xmath16 of course , the marginals are @xmath17 and @xmath18 . but this leaves many choices for the joint distribution .    in the present contribution we will not succeed in removing the question mark in ( [ eq1.4 ] ) .",
    "however , we will make a big step towards a well - founded conjecture .",
    "the idea to progress in the direction constituting the main body of our paper was set forward by kurt johansson in a discussion taking place at the 2003 workshop on growth processes at the newton institute , cambridge ( as communicated by herbert spohn ) . in a somewhat rough description , underlying the png process there is a line ensemble constructed through the robinson - schensted - knuth ( rsk ) algorithm .",
    "its top line at time @xmath3 is the height @xmath4 .",
    "thus the question mark in ( [ eq1.4 ] ) refers to the top line .",
    "but instead of ( [ eq1.4 ] ) we will study , for large @xmath3 , the line ensemble at fixed @xmath19 close to the top line . as in a way already suggested by the baik and rains result , under suitable scaling the lines at @xmath19 have indeed the statistics of the top eigenvalues of goe random matrices .",
    "the implications for ( [ eq1.4 ] ) will be discussed after explaining more precisely our main result .",
    "first we describe the png model with flat initial conditions , and secondly recall some random matrix results on goe eigenvalues , as needed to state the scaling limit .",
    "the polynuclear growth ( png ) model considered here is a @xmath0 dimensional model .",
    "one way to view png is via a graphical construction involving poisson points .",
    "consider a fixed @xmath20 and let @xmath21 be a countable configuration of points in @xmath22 $ ] .",

    "for each @xmath33 we define the height function @xmath34 , @xmath35 $ ] , by the following graphical construction . because of flat initial conditions , we set @xmath36 and we call _ nucleation events _ the points of @xmath21 .",
    "each nucleation event generates two lines , with slope @xmath37 and @xmath38 along its forward light cone .",

    "since @xmath21 is locally finite , it follows that @xmath45 , @xmath46 $ ] , is locally bounded and the number of discontinuities is locally finite .",
    "the interpretation of the graphical construction in terms of a growing surface is the following .",
    "the surface height at position @xmath47 and time @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath6 for all @xmath47 . for fixed time @xmath3 ,",
    "consider the height function @xmath4 .",
    "we say that there is an up - step ( of height one ) at @xmath15 if @xmath50 and a down - step ( of height one ) at @xmath15 if @xmath51 .",
    "a nucleation event which occurs at position @xmath15 and time @xmath3 is a creation of a pair of up- and down - step at @xmath15 at time @xmath3 .",
    "the up - steps move to the left with unit speed and the down - steps to the right with unit speed .",
    "when a pair of up- and down - step meet , they simply merge . in figure  [ figrsk2 ]",
    "the dots are the nucleation events , the lines with slope @xmath38 ( resp .",

    "other initial conditions and geometries can be treated in a similar fashion .",
    "for example , if @xmath52 is not @xmath53 for all @xmath15 , it is enough to add additional lines starting from the @xmath54 axis with slope @xmath55 reflecting the up / down direction of the steps at @xmath54 .",
    "another interesting situation is the png droplet , where one starts with flat initial conditions and there are no nucleation points outside the forward light cone starting at @xmath56 .",
    "to study the surface height at time @xmath57 , @xmath58 , it is convenient to extend to a multilayer model .",
    "this is achieved using the rsk construction .",
