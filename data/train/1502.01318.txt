    "rr  lyrae ( rrl ) stars play a key role in astrophysics .",
    "they are important distance indicators , allowing us to determine the distance to the closest galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus providing an important step in the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale . their importance in the context of galaxy formation and evolution is also being increasingly recognized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , rrl stars being unmistakably old , their distribution in the galactic halo provides evidence of the early milky way formation history @xcite .",
    "in addition , rrl stars help trace the spatial distribution , and even the age , of some of the milky way s oldest stellar populations @xcite .    despite their usefulness , there are still important uncertainties affecting the fundamental parameters and physical properties of these stars .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes of even the closest rrl are notorious for their large error bars @xcite . to complicate matters further",
    ", the exact evolutionary status of even rr  lyr itself is uncertain , with indications that it may be significantly overluminous , compared to the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) level at its metallicity @xcite .",
    "rrl variables occupy a fairly narrow strip   the so - called _ instability strip _   at intermediate temperatures along the hb .",
    "as such , their exact mass value is crucial in establishing whether an hb star will ever become an rrl , or instead , a non - variable blue or red hb star . in this sense , theory predicts that the masses of rrl stars should decrease with increasing metallicity , with little scatter at any given [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . direct empirical confirmation of this important result is , however , still lacking .",
    "most of the available information regarding rrl masses comes from the so - called _ petersen diagram _",
    "@xcite of double - mode rrl ( rrd ) stars .",
    "rrd stars are observed to pulsate simultaneously in the fundamental and first overtone radial modes , and their distribution in the period ratio vs. period ( petersen ) diagram is predicted to be a strong function of the pulsating star s mass , in addition to other parameters , such as metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "rrl star masses can thus be derived by comparing the observed positions of rrd stars in the petersen diagram with those predicted according to stellar evolution and pulsation theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this method can only be trusted to provide accurate masses if the theoretical framework upon which it is based is itself accurate . to constrain the theories themselves , it is imperative to obtain a model - independent mass measurement .",
    "binary systems allow the derivation of the masses of its components , if the orbital parameters are known . in the case of binary systems containing classical cepheids ,",
    "analysis of their orbital parameters has played a crucial role in accurately establishing their physical properties , including their masses @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cepheid - bearing binary systems are relatively common @xcite , and even systems in which _ both _ components are cepheids are now known to exist @xcite .",
    "the situation regarding rrl stars could hardly be more different , as for long only one rrl , tu  uma , has been known to reside in a binary system ( see @xcite and @xcite , for very detailed analyses of this star ) .",
    "recently , eclipsing binary rrl candidates have been found by the ogle project in the galactic bulge @xcite , as well as in the lmc @xcite .",
    "however , follow - up observations and modeling of the bulge candidate have shown that the pulsating component of this system has too low a mass to be a bona - fide rrl star @xcite .",
    "other candidate eclipsing rrl found by the ogle - ii project in the lmc @xcite have turned out to be optical blends @xcite .",
    "careful analyses of the rrl lcs of the _ kepler _ mission have uncovered only three possible binary candidates @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of metal - poor , carbon - rich rrls have been identified via spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the anomalous c abundance of these stars can be explained by mass accretion from a more massive companion , which has evolved through the asymptotic giant phase @xcite , suggesting that these rrls might be members of binary systems in which the other component has already evolved to the white dwarf stage .",
    "however , the binary nature of these rrls has not yet been directly established .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we describe our search for periodic phase variations caused by the light - travel time effect @xcite in the lcs of a subsample of well - observed rrl stars from the ogle - iii survey towards the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "we augment the lcs of the binary candidates thus obtained with newly published photometry from the ogle - iv survey @xcite , in order to increase the observational baseline .",
    "we derive binary parameters for the best candidates .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the rrl binary fraction , as well as the detectability of such systems through the light - travel time effect .",
    "analysis of the ogle - iii observations .",
    "( a ) the original lc folded with the pulsation period ( _ grey dots _ ) , its fourier fit ( _ red line _ ) , one section of the lc ( _ black dots _ ) , and the least - squares template fit ( _ blue dashed line _ ) .",
    "( b ) the resulting @xmath0 diagram ( _ dots _ ) , and the corresponding binary - model fit ( _ blue line _ ) .",
    "the point corresponding to the measurement shown in ( b ) is indicated by an arrow .",
    "( c ) the folded lc , after correcting the times of observations for the binary motion ( panel [ b ] ) .",
    "the fourier fit ( _ blue dashed line _ ) now follows the real lc shape much more closely than the original fit ( _ red line _ ) .",
    "[ method ] ]",
    "our initial analysis is based on the @xmath2-band ogle - iii lcs for bulge rrl @xcite .",
    "we analyze stars with fundamental - mode pulsation ( rrab subtype ) , as well as having an observational baseline covering more than 10  yr .",
    "these criteria define a subsample of 1952 rrab variables . for these",
    ", we have utilized the so - called _ observed minus calculated _ ( @xmath0 ) diagrams ( e.g. , @xcite ) , adopting a linear ephemeris ( @xmath3 ) for the variables :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the initial epoch , @xmath6 is the pulsation period , and @xmath7 is the epoch number , corresponding to the number of elapsed pulsation cycles since @xmath5 .",
    "times have been transformed into barycentric julian dates ( bjd ) in the barycentric dynamical time standard ( @xcite ) .    in the case of variable stars ,",
    "the @xmath0 diagram is most commonly constructed by subtracting the ephemeris ( @xmath3 ) from timing observations ( @xmath8 ) of particular features of the lcs , such as maxima or minima , and plotting this quantity as a function of time .",
    "@xcite proposed utilizing the whole lc for deriving @xmath0 points of a variable by fitting the phase of a lc template to the observations . due to",
    "the generally sparse sampling of ogle observations , determining the times of individual maxima at different epochs is unfeasible , making @xcite s method vastly superior for obtaining the required @xmath0 measurements .",
    "we thus adopt the latter method in our analysis .",
    "figure  [ method ] illustrates the procedure for one of the binary candidates .",
    "first we created a lc template by fitting the original lc with a fourier series using lcfit @xcite , as shown in figure  [ method]a .",
    "the lcs were divided into short sections corresponding to different observing seasons .",
    "sections longer than 160 days were split in two , in order to achieve better time resolution .",
    "we have derived the @xmath0 points by least - squares fitting the lc templates in phase to each of these segments .",
    "these phase shifts were then used to construct the @xmath0 diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ method]b ) .",
    "the light - travel time effect manifests itself as a strictly periodic phase modulation of the lc of a variable star , caused by its orbital motion around the common center of mass in a binary system .",
    "the change in the observed times of particular features of the lc , and consequently in the corresponding @xmath0 values , have the form :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the semi - major axis , @xmath11 is the inclination , @xmath12 is the eccentricity , and @xmath13 is the argument of the periastron .",
    "the true anomaly @xmath14 is a function of the time @xmath15 , the orbital period @xmath16 , the time of periastron passage @xmath17 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we have visually inspected the @xmath0 diagrams constructed as described previously , in search of @xmath0 shapes allowed by eq .",
    "[ lteffect ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in some cases , particularly when the period values found by @xcite have turned out to be inadequate , we have constructed the @xmath0 diagrams with several different pulsation periods .",
    "figure  [ method ] shows one of the best candidates for a binary system containing an rrl star obtained in this way . in panel",
    "b of this figure , a preliminary orbital solution is also provided .",
    "figure  [ method]c demonstrates the accuracy of the fit ; the prewhitening for the orbital solution results in a lc which has an rms deviation of only 12  mmag .",
    "a large fraction of stars show erratic period changes , possibly connected to the blazhko effect ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the blazhko effect manifests itself as an amplitude and phase modulation of the lc of rrl stars , and accordingly , variables affected by it have unreliable @xmath0 diagrams for our purposes .",
    "for this reason , we have discarded binary candidates for which the lc shape and/or amplitude showed correlated changes with the phase variations , which might be indicative of the blazhko effect .",
    "however , the presence of the blazhko effect is unclear in some of the variables , as blending with another variable star and/or large photometric errors ( in case of the fainter stars in the subsample ) , together with the sparse coverage of the ogle - iii data , could mimic and/or mask the change of the lc shape / amplitude of blazhko variables .          following the above procedure",
    ", we have selected 29 potential binary candidates . in order to clarify the status of the stars in this sample , and",
    "also to refine the binary parameters of the candidates , we next combined the ogle - iii and iv datasets for these stars , thus increasing the baselines of their @xmath0 diagrams .",
    "the full analysis of the combined ogle - iii and iv datasets will be reported in a future paper .",

    "we then repeated the previous analysis on the data thus combined .",
    "we have inspected the new @xmath0 diagrams and the combined lcs , and have found strong evidence that 6 of the candidates do in fact show the blazhko effect , which was not evident from the relatively sparse ogle - iii data alone .",
    "the @xmath0 variations of two additional candidates appear to be caused completely by their linear period changes , while for a third star , it is probably caused by irregular period changes .",
    "these discarded candidates are listed in the second column of table  [ nofit ] , leaving us with a refined sample of 20 binary candidates .",
    ".  [ lteffect ] does not take possible changes in the pulsation periods of the rrl stars into account .",
    "such changes can significantly alter the @xmath0 diagram , even on relatively short ( @xmath106  yr ) timescales . if the period changes linearly with time , the @xmath0 diagram has the following shape :    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the linear period - change rate .",
    "the increased time - base of the combined datasets allows us to take this effect fully into account .",
    "we thus fit the @xmath0 diagrams of the 20 remaining candidates with the sum of eqs .",
    "[ lteffect ] and [ parabola ] , and find that reliable parameters can be derived for 12 of them .",
    "the other 8 variables either have orbital periods that are presumably comparable or longer than the baseline of the available observations ( therefore the parameters of the fit are degenerate ) , or have very small @xmath0 amplitudes .",
    "these stars , which may still be bona - fide binaries and thus merit continued monitoring , are also listed in table  [ nofit ] .    in order to derive the best possible parameters for this 12-star sample , we iterate the @xmath0 solution once , by means of an improved fourier fit to a ( @xmath0)-subtracted lc . we also @xmath109-clip the lcs , discarding the worst - quality ( typically @xmath110 per cent ) observations for each star .",
    "the final @xmath0 points are determined by fitting these templates to the lc segments .",
    "the final diagrams , together with their fits , are shown in figure  [ results1 ] .",
    "table  [ table_parameters ] gives the fitted binary parameters for each star , as well as other relevant parameters of the fit .",
    "we have completed the first systematic search for binaries in a subsample of ogle galactic bulge rrl stars utilizing the light - travel time effect .",
    "twenty probable binaries have been found analyzing the @xmath0 diagrams and lcs of 1952 ogle - iii bulge rrab variables , which represents about 1 per cent of this particular subsample ( fundamental - mode pulsation , @xmath11110  yr observational baseline ) .",
    "this allows us to very roughly constrain the rrl binary fraction , as follows .",
    "approximately 50 per cent of rrab stars show the blazhko effect @xcite . due to their lc phase and shape changes ,",
    "determining their binarity through the @xmath0 method is impossible .",
    "therefore , all of the blazhko binaries have necessarily been missed , and so the total binary fraction must be closer to 2 per cent than to 1 per cent .",
    "we assume that the fraction of stars whose binarity was missed due to erratic pulsation period changes is small in comparison",
    ". binaries with very low inclinations and very long periods are also missed . as we have no information about the fraction of long - period binaries in the sample , and as our method is more sensitive to stars with high inclination ( because the @xmath0 amplitude is proportional to @xmath20 ) , we conservatively assume that at least half of the binaries are still missed due to these two selection effects . based on these arguments , presumably at least 4  per cent of rrl variables reside in binary systems in the sample .",
    "the recovery rate using the @xmath0 method is thus @xmath112  per cent , or perhaps lower .",
    "very few rr  lyrae stars have been reported to reside in binary systems yet ( see sect .  [ intro ] ) .",
    "the current sample allows us to assess the observational requirements to discover additional such systems .",
    "the period distribution of the binary candidates is highly skewed : we find no binaries with orbital periods shorter than @xmath113  yr , and there is a clustering of stars with orbital periods around @xmath114  yr . due to the long timescale , currently ogle is the only survey capable of discovering these variables , as high - precision ( @xmath115  mag ) , long - baseline data are indispensable .",
    "indeed , the increased baseline achieved by incorporating the ogle - iv data greatly improved the quality of the fits , as we were able to disentangle the effects of the change in the rrl pulsation periods form the effect of binarity on the @xmath0 diagrams , thus leading to more robust binary parameters .",
    "note that we have succeeded in recovering rrls with blazhko periods as short as @xmath116  yr , which is close to the limit of period detection set by the data sampling   thus indicating that binary rrls with similarly short periods would have been found through our analysis .",
    "the apparent lack of rrl variables in short - period binary systems puts a tight constraint on the inclination ( due to the wide orbits ) of eclipsing rrl binary systems , making our method much superior for the detection of rrl binaries .",
    "their faintness ( 15 - 17  mag in @xmath2 ) makes the follow - up of our binary candidates challenging .",
    "still , two of the candidates ( 06498 and 09879 ) have _ higher _ minimum masses ( calculated from the parameters in table  [ table_parameters ] for reasonable mass assumptions for the rrl ) than the rrl itself .",
    "the secondaries in some of these systems may be stars which have evolved off from the main sequence , therefore bright enough to contribute significantly to the light of the systems .",
    "if such a favorable case could be found , the mass ratio between the two stars could be measured through the ratio of their orbital radial velocities .    at the distance of the bulge , the binary candidate with the longest major axis ( 09789 , @xmath117  au )",
    "would have a projected major axis of about 0.7  mas .",
    "gaia astrometry will unfortunately be hampered by the high crowding and the faintness of the candidates .",
    "however , @xcite have demonstrated that @xmath118as astrometry with fors2@vlt is attainable on multi - year timescales , for targets with similar magnitudes as here .",
    "a long - term astrometric follow - up program might thus be feasible , in order to determine the inclination of these systems .",
    "in this study of a subsample of ogle lcs we have demonstrated that rrl stars can be detected in long - period binary systems , provided that high - quality , extended photometric datasets are used .",
    "we plan to extend our analysis to the whole ogle bulge rrl dataset in the near future . through long - term , dedicated monitoring using these techniques , and adequate follow - up",
    ", we will finally have a chance of determining the masses for a significant sample of rrl stars , and thereby directly constrain the theories of rrl star pulsation and evolution .",
