    "more than twenty years the standard model ( sm ) keeps for oneself the status of consistent and experimentally confirmed theory since the experimental data of past and present accelerators ( lep , slc and tevatron ) have shown no significant deviation from the sm predictions up to energy scales of several hundred gev",
    ". however , new physics ( np ) models : various left - right symmetric models , extended gauge theories including grand unification theories , models of composite gauge bosons @xcite , some extra dimension scenarios @xcite , extra neutral gauge bosons @xcite and fermion compositeness models @xcite predict various deviations out of the sm predictions and , therefore , their testing in the new energy scale ( thousands gev ) is one of the main tasks of modern physics .",
    "the forthcoming experiments at the collider lhc provides such possibility and probably will shed the light on this important problem in the immediate future .",
    "the experimental investigation of the continuum for the drell - yan production of a dilepton pair , i.e. data on the cross section and the forward - backward asymmetry of the reaction @xmath6 at large invariant mass of a dimuon pair ( see @xcite and references therein ) is considered to be one of the powerful tool in the experiments at the lhc from the np exploration standpoint .",
    "the studies of the np effects are impossible without the exact knowledge of the sm predictions including higher order qcd and electroweak radiative corrections ( ewc ) .",
    "the ewc to the reaction ( [ 1 ] ) are studied well ( see papers on pure qed corrections @xcite , and the qed and electroweak corrections in the z - peak region and above in @xcite and numerous papers cited there ) .",
    "the ewc result contains so - called double sudakov logarithms ( dsl ) @xcite , i.e. the expressions which are growing with the scale of energy , and thus giving one of the main effect in the region of large invariant dimuon mass . by",
    "now extensive studies have been done in this area .",
    "for instance , the weak sudakov expansion for general four - fermion processes has been studied in detail ( see , for example , @xcite and the recent paper @xcite along with the extensive list of references therein ) .",
    "obviously , the collinear logarithms of qed radiative corrections can compete with the dsl in the investigated region .",
    "this important issue has been studied at the one - loop level in @xcite , where both the qed and weak corrections have been calculated for @xmath7  2  tev , but it has yet remained unsolved in the region of @xmath8  2  tev ( with the exception of short numerical estimation of ewc to @xmath9 by program zgrad @xcite in @xcite , see fig.7 there ) .",
    "other important contributions in the investigated reaction at high invariant masses are the higher - order corrections ( two - loop electroweak logarithms , at least ) , which also have been studied in the works @xcite , @xcite ( see also the numerous papers cited therein ) .",
    "weak boson emission contribution has been recently calculated in @xcite and the contribution of higher - order corrections due to multiple photon emission has been computed in @xcite , these contributions are beyond the presented calculations .",
    "thus , for the future experiments at lhc aimed at the searches of np in the reaction ( [ 1 ] ) it is urgent to know exactly the sm predictions , including the radiative background , i.e. the processes , which are experimentally indistinguishable from ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the important task is the insertion of this background into the lhc monte carlo generators and they should be both accurate and fast . for them to be fast it is necessary to have a set of compact formulas for the ewc .",
    "they are obtained in our previous paper @xcite using the asymptotic approach ( aa ) and improved in subsequent paper @xcite . to speed up the bremsstrahlung calculation and increase its accuracy",
    "it is very important to have all formulas for the cross sections and kinematical restrictions in explicit form appropriate for adaptive multidimensional integration .",
    "we obtained such form here and reached the high speed and good accuracy of calculation using the @xmath1 and @xmath2functions apparatus .",
    "our notations are the following ( see fig.1,a ) : @xmath10 is the 4-momentum of the first ( second ) quark or antiquark with the flavor @xmath11 and mass @xmath12;@xmath13 is the 4-momentum of the final muon @xmath14 with the mass @xmath15 ;  @xmath16 is the 4-momentum of the @xmath17-boson with the mass @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ;  @xmath20 is the 4-momentum of initial nucleon @xmath21 .",
