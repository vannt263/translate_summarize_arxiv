    "the cygnus region is a part of our galaxy of active massive star formation and destruction , and has been studied over a broad range of wavelengths , including radio , x - ray , gev and tev gamma - ray , as well as in cosmic rays . from gev up to multi - tev energies",
    "the cygnus region is the brightest diffuse gamma - ray source in the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "one of the challenges in analyzing the cygnus region at tev energies , is the proper separation of the gamma - ray flux that is attributed to the point or extended sources in the region or to the diffuse emission .",
    "previous milagro analyses computed the diffuse emission from the region using two alternative methods to isolate the contribution from the resolved sources @xcite , and found that at tev energies the flux is still in excess with respect to the predicted flux from the galprop model @xcite .",
    "milagro also published the discovery of two unidentified tev sources in the region , mgro j2019 + 37 and mgro j2031 + 41 @xcite .",
    "the location of mgro j2019 + 37 was found to be consistent with two egret sources , while the best fit position for mgro j2031 + 41 was near two egret sources and the hegra unidentified source tev j2032 + 4130 . in a correlation study connecting the tev sources discovered by milagro with sources detected above 10@xmath0 ( the so - called bright source list , bsl ) by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) ,",
    "the two aforementioned brightest milagro sources in the region were associated with gev pulsars @xcite .",
    "mgro j2019 + 37 and mgro j2031 + 41 are currently associated with two and one pulsars identified by the fermi lat , respectively @xcite .",
    "milagro also detected two candidate sources in the cygnus region ( @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] ) @xcite .",
    "recently , several collaborations have presented new surveys of the cygnus region , confirming the complexity of the region and showing the highly structured diffuse emission .",
    "the tev emission from the position of mgro j2019 + 37 has been confirmed by the veritas experiment @xcite .",
    "the veritas spatial counts map shows a clear structure associated with mgro j2019 + 37 , a region of extended emission which seems to be produced by previously unresolved sources . at lower energies ,",
    "the fermi lat collaboration has also recently published new results on the diffuse emission from the cygnus region .",
    "an extended source , the so - called cocoon , overlapping with mgro j2031 + 41 , has been found and its emission has been explained by freshly accelerated cosmic rays , trapped in a shell of photon - dominated emission formed by stellar winds and supernovae , as shown by mid - infrared observations @xcite .",
    "the spectrum from this region is hard , extending up to 100 gev with no evidence of softening , and could be explained as the result of pulsar - accelerated particles or as an active super - bubble .",
    "the average diffuse emission from the region has also been analyzed at mev to gev energies @xcite . despite the very rich source population ,",
    "this emission is similar to that of the local interstellar space , and there is no evidence that it is necessary to include an extra contribution in the model , resembling the diffuse excess previously measured by milagro @xcite .",
    "most recently , the argo - ybj collaboration presented the results of a survey of the cygnus region in the energy range of 600 gev to 7 tev .",
    "mgro j2031 + 41 is observed with a significance of 6.4@xmath0 and a flux consistent with previous milagro results , but there is no significant detection of mgro j2019 + 37 @xcite .",
    "here , we present a new analysis of the last three years of data collected with the milagro experiment ( 2005 - 2008 ) . an improved gamma - hadron separation and a newly - developed technique",
    "are exploited to reconstruct the energy spectra of gamma rays from the sources in the cygnus region .",
    "the best fits for the spectra of the two brightest milagro sources are presented : mgro j2019 + 37 , a source with a post - trials significance in excess of 12@xmath0 between 1 and 100 tev , and mgro j2031 + 41 a source with a post - trials significance in excess of 7@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we compare our spectra with results from the hegra , magic , whipple and argo - ybj experiments @xcite .",
    "the milagro detector was located in the jemez mountains in new mexico , at an altitude of 2,630 m a.l.s .",
    "it was operated from 2001 to 2008 , and , in its final configuration , consisted of two components : ( 1 ) a central pond ( @xmath11 @xmath12 , 8 m deep ) with two photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) layers , a shallow _ air shower _ layer consisting of 450 pmts , and a deep _ muon layer _ consisting of 273 pmts and ( 2 ) an array of 175 single - pmt tank detectors surrounding the pond covering an area of 40,000 @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the analysis method and the parameters used here can be found in the milagro paper on the spectral measurement of the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "systematic uncertainties of this method are estimated to be @xmath830% on the overall flux and @xmath80.1 on the spectral index .",
    "the new element in this analysis , with respect to the previous approach @xcite , is the introduction of an estimator , @xmath13 , for the energy of the primary particle initiating the extensive air shower , based on the number of pmts hit for each event .",
    "the @xmath13 parameter is defined as the sum of two fractions : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the number of pmts detecting the event , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number of functional pmts in the air shower layer and in the tank array , respectively . because the typical energy resolution of milagro is quite broad ( 50 - 100% ) , and the median energy associated with a given @xmath13 value is dependent on the spectral assumption for the observed source , the fit is performed in the measured @xmath13 space rather than in the energy space .",
    "the reconstructed milagro data contain information about the direction and @xmath13 value of air shower events . according to their @xmath13 value ,",
    "events are sorted into 9 bins ( @xmath19 ) , resulting in a total of 9 signal skymaps , binned in @xmath20 pixels . for each @xmath13 bin",
    ", background maps are calculated using the direct integration method @xcite .",
    "the two brightest regions of interest in the sky , a @xmath21 area around the position of the crab nebula and a band around the galactic plane ( @xmath22 ) are excluded when calculating the background @xcite . rather than discriminating between gamma - ray and cosmic - ray initiated",
    "air showers , a weight is applied to all measured events , in both signal and background maps , where gamma - ray like events are assigned a higher weight than cosmic - ray like events @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray excess with respect to the estimated background is calculated as the difference between signal weights and background weights , and is filled into the so - called excess map .",
    "based on these excess maps we compute the @xmath13 distributions used in the energy fit .",
    "excess maps are smoothed according to the detector angular resolution ( or point spread function , psf ) , which is a function of @xmath13 and varies between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the measured @xmath13 distribution for the target source in a @xmath20 bin , as a result , is the average excess coming from a psf - wide region around the nominal source position . since the background is measured with the direct integration method removing the galactic plane ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , the measured excess from sources in the galactic plane includes any other diffuse or extended emission possibly present in the vicinity of the source .",
    "the galactic diffuse background was estimated to contribute up to 15% of the flux at 35 tev for the weakest galactic bsl source @xcite .",
    "we test the emission from the two sources for two different spectral hypotheses : a power law , defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the normalization scale set at 10 tev and @xmath29 the spectral index , and a power law with an exponential cutoff , defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the cutoff energy .",
    "the fit to the data is performed comparing the measured excess to simulations .",
    "first , a set of simulated data is generated varying sensitive parameters ( i.e. @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "the best spectral parameters and the corresponding fit probability are then found using a @xmath32 minimization , comparing the measured and the simulated @xmath13 distributions .",
    "uncertainties on fit parameters are computed using 1-@xmath0 contours of @xmath33 histograms ( as discussed in sections [ s.2019 ] and [ s.2031 ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty is defined as the distance between the best fit value and the lower and upper edges of the 1-@xmath0 contour .",
    "the results presented here are obtained from the analysis of the milagro data taken with the detector in its final configuration .",
    "the start date is 2005 - 10 - 22 20:39:16 gmt and the stop date is 2008 - 04 - 15 00:02:53 gmt , corresponding to a total of 906 days of observation , resulting in 832 integrated days after data quality cuts .",
    "the positions of mgro j2019 + 37 and mgro j2031 + 41 are obtained fitting milagro excess maps with a 2-dimensional gaussian function with equal widths in right ascension and declination ( @xmath34 ) , plus a constant base to take into account contribution from diffuse emission .",
    "the fit is performed in a square region of @xmath35 around the excess .",

    "the excess from mgro j2019 + 37 is compared to the excess measured from the entire cygnus region ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",

    "the spectrum as measured by the air cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) is much harder ( @xmath492 ) than the milagro power law best fit ( @xmath493 ) .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the following two facts .",
    "first , the angular resolution of hegra and magic ( @xmath50 ) is much better than that of milagro ( @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) .",
    "the whipple flux was measured at 0.6 tev , with a psf of @xmath51 , and it agrees better with the extrapolation of the milagro result at lower energies .",
    "the same is true for argo - ybj , which , with an angular resolution between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , measured an emission consistent with the results presented here . the measurement presented in this paper accounts for photons coming from a larger region around the nominal source position compared to acts .",
    "second , the way the background is computed is also different . whipple used the on / off method and observed the source with a significance of 3.3@xmath0 , while magic primarily was operated in wobble mode ( 5.6@xmath0 ) .",
    "a possible explanation of the presented results is that tev j2032 + 4130 , whose extension is slightly larger than the hegra and magic angular resolution , is surrounded by an extended emission , @xmath8@xmath54 according to the milagro map ( see fig .",
    "[ f.maps ] discussed in sec .",
    "[ s.morphology ] ) . therefore , milagro , whipple and argo - ybj are not able to disentangle the extended emission from the central source and observe a higher flux .",
    "magic and hegra , on the other hand , take into account the extended emission as a background . as a result ,",

    "our result , in particular the integral flux in the overlapping energy range , is consistent with previous measurements by argo - ybj and whipple , but it disagrees with hegra and magic results for tev j2032 + 4130 , most likely because of the different psf of the instruments and different background subtraction methods .",

    "<S> the cygnus region is a very bright and complex portion of the tev sky , host to unidentified sources and a diffuse excess with respect to conventional cosmic - ray propagation models . </S>",
    "<S> two of the brightest tev sources , mgro j2019 + 37 and mgro j2031 + 41 , are analyzed using milagro data with a new technique , and their emission is tested under two different spectral assumptions : a power law and a power law with an exponential cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the new analysis technique is based on an energy estimator that uses the fraction of photomultiplier tubes in the observatory that detect the extensive air shower . </S>",
    "<S> the photon spectrum is measured in the range 1 to 200 tev using the last 3 years of milagro data ( 2005 - 2008 ) , with the detector in its final configuration . </S>",
    "<S> mgro j2019 + 37 is detected with a significance of 12.3 standard deviations ( @xmath0 ) , and is better fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff than by a simple power law , with a probability @xmath1% ( f - test ) . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fitting parameters for the power law with exponential cutoff model are a normalization at 10 tev of @xmath2 @xmath3 , a spectral index of @xmath4 and a cutoff energy of @xmath5 tev . </S>",
    "<S> mgro j2031 + 41 is detected with a significance of 7.3@xmath0 , with no evidence of a cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fitting parameters for a power law are a normalization of @xmath6 @xmath3 and a spectral index of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the overall flux is subject to an @xmath830% systematic uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic uncertainty on the power law indices is @xmath80.1 . a comparison with previous results from tev j2032 + 4130 </S>",
