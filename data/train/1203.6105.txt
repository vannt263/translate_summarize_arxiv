    "the influence of energetic disorder on the charge carrier mobility is already known for decades : the thermally activated hopping process of charge carriers , which can also be described by the multiple - trapping - and - release ( mtr ) approach , leads to a carrier concentration dependent mobility.@xcite charge carriers located in the density of states below the transport energy are trapped and immobile ( with density @xmath22 ) whereas charge carriers above ( with density @xmath23 ) are free and have the mobility @xmath24 .",

    "although the mtr model already includes the existence and influence of trap states we will demonstrate that in addition to the influence on the charge carrier mobility , the donor  acceptor phase separation can protect trapped charge carriers from recombination .",

    "this assumptions is at least justified for p3ht : pc@xmath0bm between short circuit and open circuit.@xcite    as we want to find out wether the carrier concentration dependent mobility alone can explain the recombination orders exceeding two , we analyze the different carrier concentration dependent contributions to the langevin recombination rate ( eq .

    "we already pointed out that it is our aim to show that @xmath51 does not always equal @xmath54 , i.e. that the high recombination orders can generally not be solely explained by the carrier concentration dependent mobility .",
