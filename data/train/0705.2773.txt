    "radio continuum observations of the second quadrant of our galaxy ( @xmath0 ) provide an unmatched opportunity for studying the structure and content of a spiral arm in detail .",
    "the perseus arm dominates galactic structure in this quadrant and is viewed almost perpendicular to its long axis over the entire longitude range .",
    "the more distant outer arm is also well placed for study in this quadrant and in both cases confusion from local arm sources is minimal ( cf .",
    "the view of the galaxy around @xmath1 looking along the local arm ) .",
    "the previously best view of this region in the radio continuum ( at 1420 mhz ) was a series of surveys done by the effelsberg 100-m telescope at 9-arcmin resolution .",
    "the surveys were summarized in the @xcite and @xcite catalogues ( kr and rrf respectively ) .",
    "rrf provides a listing of small diameter sources ( @xmath2 arcmin in extent ) with an 80 mjy flux density limit ( for point sources ) .",
    "the kr catalogue has a higher flux density limit ( 0.3 jy ) but is of particular interest to galactic studies as it lists both compact and extended objects .    the new canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ; @xcite ) data provide an unprecedented view of the continuum radiation at both 1420 and 408 mhz from the outer galaxy .",
    "the data have arcminute - scale resolution and have full spatial frequency sensitivity crucial for the detection of extended structures .    in this paper",
    "we first revisit the sources found in the kr catalogue .",
    "@xcite obtained high resolution vla images of the sources originally classified as point sources in kr .",
    "for these sources we are primarily interested in observing the few of them that had poor vla observations and to look for inverted spectrum sources .",
    "@xcite obtained one - dimensional scans at 7.6 and 31.3 cm of most of the extended kr sources using the ratan-600 telescope and found that many of the apparently extended kr objects were compact sources ( @xmath3 1-arcmin scale ) .",
    "@xcite also suggested that a number of the kr objects were previously unknown compact galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "we have reexamined all of these sources using the higher resolution and regular beamshape of the cgps data and have been able to better determine the nature of all of the extended kr objects .",
    "in the course of this study a new sample of extragalactic gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources has been compiled .",
    "cgps data have also revealed numerous new extended emission features in the second quadrant including both low - surface brightness extended emission and narrow filamentary features  both of which tend to be missed in the lower resolution surveys .",
    "the second paper in this series will present a complete catalogue of all extended emission features seen in the cgps radio continuum data thus providing an updated version of the comprehensive catalogue compiled by @xcite .    in the next section we review the properties of the cgps 1420 and 408 mhz data . in sections  [ sec :",
    "kr ] and [ sec : kr - p ] the cgps view of the kr sources is presented .",
    "flat and inverted spectrum sources are discussed in section  [ sec : fiss ] and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the goal of the cgps is to enhance the study of our galaxy by obtaining arcminute - resolution images of all of the major components of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in our galaxy .",
    "radio continuum observations made as part of this project were obtained using the seven - element interferometer at the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) in penticton , canada @xcite .",
    "details of the cgps radio continuum observations , data reduction and data distribution are discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "cgps observations currently cover @xmath4 between @xmath5 encompassing almost the entire second quadrant .",
    "the 1420 mhz observations have a nominal 1-arcmin resolution and both the 1420 and 408 mhz survey images were constructed with full spatial frequency coverage by combining the interferometer data with data from surveys using the effelsberg single - dish and the stockert single - dish telescopes .",
    "this provides sensitivity to extended structure which is very important for galactic studies .",
    "the simultaneous 408 mhz images , with nominal 3-arcmin resolution , provide invaluable data on the shape of the radio continuum spectrum as parameterized by the spectral index ( @xmath6 ) between 408 and 1420 mhz ( where flux density f@xmath7 ) .",
    "in this paper we refer to inverted - spectrum sources as those with @xmath8 and flat - spectrum sources as those with @xmath9 .",
    "we also make use of the mid - infrared galaxy atlas ( miga ; @xcite ) and infrared galaxy atlas ( iga ; @xcite ) arcminute resolution infrared images which make up part of the larger cgps data collection .",
    "these infrared images are very useful in the identification of galactic regions in cases where there is no associated optical emission or available radio recombination line observations .",
    "flux density measurements were made using software contained in the drao export software package .",
    "point source flux densities were obtained using the `` fluxfit '' program which fits gaussians to the image and makes use of the beam shape information available in the cgps data .",
    "extended sources were measured using the `` imview '' program which allows the user to interactively derive background levels to use in determining the flux densities .",
    "the kr catalogue is based on 1420 mhz radio continuum observations made at 9-arcmin resolution with the effelsburg 100-m telescope .",
    "@xcite identified 236 radio sources with flux density @xmath10 jy including point sources and extended objects up to 30-arcmin in diameter .",
    "the catalogue covered @xmath11 to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "extended sources were subdivided into three categories depending upon their apparent size : ep ( partially extended ) , e ( extended ) and ve ( very extended ) .",
    "ep sources had a greatest extent of @xmath14  9-arcmin , e sources had greatest extents between 11-arcmin and 20-arcmin , while ve sources had greatest extents between 20-arcmin and 30-arcmin .     and @xmath15 .",
    "kr  4 is located in the lower left corner of this panel around @xmath16 .",
    "the lower panel shows the central region and reveals an intricate combination of filaments and bubble - like structures.,width=317 ]          data on the twelve very - extended ( ve ) objects identified by @xcite are listed in table  [ tab : ve ] .",
    "the first column gives the kr catalogue number .",
    "letters following the kr number are used in cases where the object is actually a multiple source at arcminute resolution and are not part of the original classification ( e.g. , kr206a ) .",
    "columns 2 through 5 give the flux density measurements and 1@xmath17 error estimates at 1420 and 408 mhz from the cgps data . the spectral index between 408 and 1420 mhz ( @xmath6 ) is given in column 6 followed by the angular scale of the source as seen in the 1420 mhz images in column 7 .",
    "the final column provides extra information about the source , such as an association with well - known optically visible region or snr .",
    "for extended ( at 1-arcmin resolution ) sources the rrf catalogue number is given if applicable , and for all of the arcminute - scale point sources the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) catalogue designation is provided .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     table  [ tab : if ] is presented in its entirety in the electronic edition of the journal .",
    "in order to identify potential gps sources we examined in more detail 43 of the sources which had @xmath18 . as before ,",
    "radio data from the compilation of @xcite were used to construct spectra over as wide a range of frequencies as possible . of these objects eight of them",
    "were found to have a curvature of @xmath19 .",
    "the radio spectra of these objects are shown in figure  [ fig : curve ] .",
    "we also found four other objects in the sample that had rising spectra ( @xmath20 over the entire spectral range ) combined with little scatter ( see figure  [ fig : rise ] ) .",
    "these sources may be examples of , relatively rare , gps sources with a peak above 5 ghz similar to the point source 71p 52 ( nvss 213551 + 471022 ) examined by @xcite .",
    "the kr catalogue is very useful for galactic studies as it contains information on both compact and extended radio sources in the outer galaxy .",
    "unfortunately the relatively low resolution of the survey means that it overestimates the number of extended sources in the outer galaxy .",
    "this paper updates this catalogue based primarily on new higher resolution images of the outer galaxy at 1420 mhz obtained as part of the cgps .",
    "we have clearly identified sources that were misclassified as extended objects and have determined which sources remain unresolved at 1-arcmin scale resolution .",
    "the simultaneous 408 mhz cgps observations , combined with ancillary infrared data , also have allowed the nature of all of the observed kr sources to be determined with some confidence .",
    "attention has been drawn particularly to a large number of unstudied perseus arm regions ( including the extremely large kr 1 complex ) , objects previously considered to be snr candidates ( e.g. , kr 171 ) , and a sample of large radio galaxies ( e.g. , kr 144 ) .",
    "in addition , through the examination of the 408 and 1420 mhz cgps images , this study has identified a sample of flat - spectrum and inverted - spectrum extragalactic radio sources based upon their 408 and 1420 mhz flux densities .",
    "a subset of these objects was examined in more detail and a new sample of gps sources has been compiled .",
    "i would like to thank isu undergraduate students jason murphy and jon patterson for their assistance on this project .",
    "the dominion radio astrophysical observatory is operated by the national research council of canada .",
