    "the bound states of a quark and an antiquark are characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total angular momentum , @xmath6 is the parity and @xmath7 is the charge conjugation .",
    "there exist three types of different quantum numbers for the known vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , the first quantum numbers can be assigned to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 vector mesons with isospin @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the second and the third quantum numbers are assigned to the axial - vector mesons @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , correspondingly . note that we have two different types of axial - vector mesons and the key point is the difference between the last two assignments for these .",
    "let us consider the extended nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl )  @xcite models .",
    "in such models the lagrangian contains only the quark fields , while the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the hadron states are generated dynamically by the model itself .",
    "the mesonic states arise as excitations of quark  antiquark pairs and that defines their interactions with the quarks .    in the relativistic theory",
    "the symmetry group is the lorentz group @xmath20 , which is isomorphic to the direct product of the two spatial rotation groups @xmath21 .",
    "the lowest representations of the @xmath20 group , which can be used as building blocks for the construction of higher spin representations , are chiral fundamental spinors transforming according to two inequivalent representations @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "they correspond to quarks with different chiralities .",
    "there exists two possibilities to construct the meson fields with the spin 1 .",
    "the vector representation @xmath0 arises from the product between the left @xmath22 and the right @xmath23 fundamental spinors .",
    "there are the vector @xmath24 and the axial - vector @xmath25 bilinear forms of the quark spinor fields with quantum numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which couple to the vector and axial - vector mesons respectively .",
    "they have gauge - like interactions with the quarks and can be described by the gauge vector @xmath26 and axial - vector @xmath27 fields .    to describe the mesons with the quantum numbers @xmath10 we must use other inequivalent chiral representations @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can be constructed , if one uses only the product either of the left @xmath22 or of the right @xmath23 fundamental spinors .",
    "these mesonic states correspond to the bilinear form @xmath28 , and are described by the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath29 , rather than by the gauge fields .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath29 have six independent components : three - vector and three - axial - vector , and can be decomposed in the axial - vector @xmath30 and the vector @xmath31  @xcite , where @xmath32 is a dimensionless unit vector .",
    "each of the vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 has three independent components due to the antisymmetric property of @xmath29 . besides the axial - vector mesons @xmath33 with quantum numbers @xmath10 , there are additional vector mesons @xmath34 with quantum numbers @xmath8 , like those of the gauge mesons @xmath26 , but having different coupling to the quarks",
    ".    these excitations _ were missed _ in the njl model and they are not considered as real particles at the present time . in this paper",
    "we shall show how we can use the newly introduced quasi - particles in the njl framework .",
    "to demonstrate this idea we deal with the one - flavour njl model only .",
    "one of the most important symmetries of the real world and qcd , which holds in the njl model , is chiral symmetry . following the classical paper",
    "@xcite we require that the primary fermion interaction must be invariant under @xmath35- and ordinary phase transformations :  ,",
    "| |  , [ chiral ]  ,   | |  , [ usual ] where @xmath36 is a constant and @xmath37 is the dirac spinor corresponding to a quark field . we restrict ourselves to the consideration of quark - antiquark bound state formations as real particles .",
    "these states are explicitly invariant under transformations ( [ usual ] ) .    whilst the dirac spinor has four components one can construct 16 independent bilinear forms in quark - antiquark channel : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . under the lorentz group",
    "they transform as scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial - vector and antisymmetric tensor , correspondingly . to deal with the chiral properties of these bilinear forms it is useful to define chiral currents : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the vector @xmath47 and axial - vector @xmath48 currents obviously satisfy the chiral invariance . the last two terms transform under ( [ chiral ] ) as follows : ^  s^ ,   t^ _  t^_.    now we can construct the chiral invariant lagrangian choosing scalar @xmath49 and tensor @xmath50 current - current interactions with opposite chiralities and quadratic forms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 interactions . the former is the primary interaction in the original work @xcite of nambu and jona - lasinio .",
    "the latter interaction is used in the extensions of the njl model to achieve a sufficient attractive force in the axial - vector channel @xcite . what about the tensor interactions ?",
    "it is easy to check that its lorentz invariant form ^+ _  t^- _ = ( |_)^2- ( |_^5)^2 0 exactly equals zero , because @xmath51 and @xmath52 belong to different irreducible representations of the lorentz group , namely @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore impossible to include tensor excitations in a local one - flavour njl model .",
    "possible minimal extension has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the effective four - fermion lagrangian has the form @xmath53 ~-~g_v~(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma_\\mu\\psi)^2",
    "-~g_a~(\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma^5\\psi)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&g_t~[\\hat{\\partial}_\\mu(\\bar{\\psi}\\sg_{\\mu\\ld}\\psi)\\cdot   \\hat{\\partial}_\\nu(\\bar{\\psi}\\sg_{\\nu\\ld}\\psi)- \\hat{\\partial}_\\mu(\\bar{\\psi}\\sg_{\\mu\\ld}\\gamma^5\\psi)\\cdot   \\hat{\\partial}_\\nu(\\bar{\\psi}\\sg_{\\nu\\ld}\\gamma^5\\psi ) ] .",
    "\\label{eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the nonlinear current - current interactions ( [ eff ] ) can be linearized by means of the formula = c , [ path ] where auxiliary fields @xmath54 will play the role of collective meson states .",
    "then the initial lagrangian takes the form @xmath55 here we have introduced all possible low - lying collective states .",
    "they are scalar @xmath56 , pseudoscalar @xmath6 , two vectors @xmath26 , @xmath34 and two axial - vectors @xmath27 , @xmath33 with the following quantum numbers :    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us note that there are two different vector mesons @xmath26 and @xmath34 with the same quantum numbers . therefore , the physical states of such mesons can be linear combinations of them meson can have both gauge and anomalous tensor couplings with the quarks  @xcite , while the axial - vector mesons with quantum numbers @xmath9 have only gauge interactions and the axial - vector mesons with quantum numbers @xmath10 have only tensor interactions . ] .",
    "integration over the quark field @xmath37 leads to an effective lagrangian for the meson fields with proper induced kinetic and mass terms .",
    "various interactions among the meson fields also arise  @xcite . here",
    "we are only interested in a mass matrix .",
    "it is well known that after spontaneous symmetry breaking , when the quark field acquires mass @xmath57 , we get the scalar meson with the mass @xmath58 and the massless pseudoscalar meson .",
    "due to interactions with the scalar field @xmath56",
    "the mass terms for the vector and axial - vector mesons are also modified .",
    "the final lagrangian for the mass terms reads @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "here @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath57 masses can be independent .",
    "but if we believe that the effective four - fermion interactions of the quarks could originate in qcd by gluon exchange in the @xmath65 limit , one obtains @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this reduces the number of unknown parameters to three .",
    "therefore , we can derive one relation for four physical masses .          as long",
    "as the isospin triplets consist of @xmath68 and @xmath69 quarks with approximately the same constituent masses we can apply this one - flavour model to the charged mesons @xmath11 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath70 in order to avoid mixing with @xmath71 quark for @xmath15 multiplets . in this case",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 are solutions of the quadratic equation : ^2-(m^2_a_1+m^2_b_1 - 12m^2 )  + ( m^2_a_1 - 6m^2)(m^2_b_1 - 12m^2 ) = 0 .",
    "[ roots ] using the vite theorem we get immediately from ( [ roots ] ) the following useful relationships : \\ {        as long as the masses of @xmath11 and @xmath18 mesons are known with better precision than the @xmath70 or @xmath16 masses , we take them as input parameters  @xcite : @xmath76 mev and @xmath77 mev .",
    "then we can compare the predicted @xmath78  ",
    "@xmath79 relation ( @xmath80 allowed region between curves in fig .",
    "1 ) with the experimental data . for this purpose",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "1 the combined result for the charged @xmath81 mass measurements  @xcite and the pdg result  @xcite for @xmath16 mass with @xmath80 allowed intervals . the last high - precision measurement of @xmath16 mass  @xcite is also shown .    we can conclude that there is reasonable agreement between the prediction ( [ result ] ) and the experimental data .",
    "quantitatively , the higher value of @xmath16 mass @xmath82 mev is favoured ( in comparison with pdg ) , if the following @xmath70 mass value @xmath83 mev  @xcite is accepted .",
    "the latter is confirmed by the latest experimental data .",
    "the corresponding quark mass is @xmath84 mev .",
    "it leads to the prediction for the mass of the sigma meson @xmath85 mev that is also in excellent concordance with the recent experiment  @xcite @xmath86 mev .",
