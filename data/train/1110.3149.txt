    "gauge interactions are the only well - established fundamental interactions in nature .",
    "the method of the covariant derivatives leads to the unique minimal form of the gauge boson couplings to the matter fermions . nevertheless , the yukawa interactions of the higgs bosons are also necessary for self - consistent construction of the standard model ( sm ) . furthermore , although the gauge symmetry allows anomalous interactions in the initial lagrangian , all known fundamental spin-1 bosons ( photon , @xmath10 , @xmath11 boson and gluons ) possess only renormalizable minimal interactions with the known fermions .",
    "the anomalous interactions are considered as effective ones and are generated at the level of the quantum loop corrections .",
    "they are usually proportional to the additional square of a small coupling constant and can be neglected in the first - order approximation .",
    "new heavy neutral gauge bosons are predicted in many extensions of the sm .",
    "they are associated with additional u(1)@xmath12 gauge symmetries and are generically called @xmath2 bosons .",
    "the minimal gauge interactions of these bosons with matter lead to the well - known angular distribution of outgoing leptons ( the @xmath2 decay product ) in the dilepton center - of - mass reference frame @xmath13 which at present is interpreted as a canonical signature for the intermediate vector ( spin-1 ) bosons .",
    "the coefficient @xmath14 defines the backward - forward asymmetry , depending on @xmath15-parity of @xmath2 boson couplings to matter .",
    "in addition , another type of spin-1 bosons may exist , which leads to a different signature in the angular distribution .",
    "this follows from the presence of different types of relativistic spin-1 fermion currents @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] , which can couple to the corresponding bosons .",
    "a clear example of such kind of interactions is provided by the hadron physics of the quark - antiquark mesons , which is considered as a low - energy qcd effective theory , where gluon and quark degrees of freedom are substituted by physical hadronic states .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that _ three different _ quantum numbers j@xmath18 of existing neutral spin-1 mesons , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , can not be assigned just to _ two _ vector @xmath22 and axial - vector @xmath23 quark states , which possess quantum numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the additional quark states @xmath24 and @xmath25 are required , which also describe vector and axial - vector mesons , but with different transformation properties with respect to the lorentz group and with different quantum numbers @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "this example demonstrates that the pure tensor state , @xmath28 meson , exists . furthermore , due to strong dynamics , vector @xmath29 and @xmath30 mesons have minimal and anomalous couplings with vector @xmath31 and tensor @xmath32 interpolating currents comparable in magnitude @xcite .",
    "the both currents have the same quantum numbers j@xmath33 and mix .",
    "since the parity and charge conjugation are conserved in qcd , they define the quantum numbers of the mesons .",
    "the mesons assigned to the tensor quark states are some types of `` excited '' states as far as the only orbital angular momentum with @xmath34 contributes to the total angular momentum , while the total spin of the system is zero .",
    "this property manifests itself in their derivative couplings to matter and a different chiral structure of the anomalous interactions in comparison with the minimal gauge ones .",
    "in contrast with the minimal gauge couplings , where either only left - handed or right - handed fermions participate in the interactions , the tensor currents mix both left - handed and right - handed fermions . therefore , like the higgs particles , the corresponding bosons carry a nonzero chiral charge . to our knowledge ,",
    "such bosons were first introduced by kemmer @xcite and they naturally appear in the extended conformal supergravity theories @xcite .",
    "in fact , this qcd feature can be realized in electroweak physics as well like the technicolor models .",
    "this analogy gives us arguments in favor of existence of anomalously interacting vector bosons .",
    "up to now no search for excited bosons has been done , but regular searches for the excited lepton and quark states @xmath35 have been carried out at the modern colliders , such as lep @xcite , hera @xcite and tevatron @xcite .",
    "these excited fermions have magnetic moment ( pauli ) type couplings to ordinary matter @xmath36 where the parameter @xmath37 is connected to the compositeness mass scale of the new physics . there are no objections to interpreting the interactions ( [ f * ] ) from a different point of view , introducing excited boson states instead of fermionic ones ( `` shifting the @xmath38-sign to the right from @xmath39 to @xmath11 '' ) @xmath40 this `` symmetry '' between excited fermions and bosons further supports our interest in consideration of the anomalously interacting vector bosons .",
    "this review paper summarizes our attempts @xcite to fill the gap in the consideration of experimental properties of heavy chiral bosons and continues discussions of possibilities of disentangling them from other particles .    the material below is given in the following order . in section",
    "ii a simple chiral boson model is formulated for further consideration .",
    "section iii contains our numerical estimations of the boson properties within the framework of the comphep / calchep package @xcite . to this end",
    "a new model has been implemented , which includes additional new bosons and their corresponding interactions . in section",
    "iv the first experimental constraints on the masses of both chiral vector bosons are given .",
    "section v briefly describes new unique signatures of the bosons in dijet final states .",
    "our conclusions are given in section vi .",
    "let us assume that the electroweak gauge sector of the sm is extended by a doublet of new spin-1 _ chiral _ bosons @xmath41 with the internal quantum numbers of the sm higgs boson .",
    "there are at least three different classes of theories , all motivated by the hierarchy problem , which predict new vector weak doublets with masses not far from the electro - weak scale .",
    "in particular , they can originate from the extensions of the sm such as gauge - higgs unification , larger gauge groups or technicolor models @xcite .",
    "however , due to the lack of fully realistic models , the collider expectations for signals from these chiral bosons have not yet been studied in detail .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to point out several model - independent and unique signatures which allow one to identify production of such bosons at the hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "since the tensor current mixes the left - handed and right - handed fermions , which in the sm are assigned to different representations , the gauge doublet should have only anomalous interactions @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the boson mass , @xmath44 is the coupling constant of the su(2)@xmath45 weak gauge group , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 generically denote up - type and down - type leptons and quarks .",
    "this choice of couplings makes identical all partial fermionic decay widths of the well - known hypothetical @xmath48 boson with the sm - like interactions @xmath49 and the charged @xmath1 boson with the same mass .",
    "here we also assume universality of lepton and quark couplings with different flavors . in full analogy with the above - mentioned mesons these bosons ,",
    "coupled to the tensor quark currents , can be considered as _ excited _ states .",
    "this property manifests itself in their derivative couplings to fermions and in the different chiral structure of the interactions in contrast to the minimal gauge interactions .    for simplicity , in ( [ master ] ) we have introduced only interactions with the down - type right - handed singlets , @xmath50 . in particular , in order to allow a possibility of detecting the neutral @xmath51-even @xmath52 bosons via their decays into charged leptons ( the drell  yan - like process ) they should couple to the _ down _ type of fermions @xmath53 since we have introduced the complex @xmath41 doublet , there is an additional neutral @xmath51-odd @xmath54 boson .",
    "however , in the case of light final states it is impossible to discriminate the multiplicative quantum numbers of the neutral bosons , namely @xmath15 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , in the following calculations we will consider only one of them , for instance , the @xmath56 boson .    for comparison we will consider topologically analogous gauge interactions of the @xmath2 boson @xmath57 with the same mass @xmath43 .",
    "the coupling constants are chosen in such a way that all fermionic decay widths in the born approximation of the both neutral bosons are identical .",
    "it means that their total production cross sections at the hadron colliders are nearly equal up to next - to - leading order corrections .",
    "their total fermionic decay width @xmath58 is sufficiently narrow so that they can be identified as resonances at the hadron colliders in the drell  yan process .",
    "furthermore , as several higgs doublets are introduced in many of the sm extensions , the realistic model could include several gauge doublets . using the charge - conjugated doublet @xmath59 ( or new ones with the hypercharges opposite to the @xmath60 doublet )",
    "one can construct more complicated models including up - type right - handed singlets , @xmath61 , as well .",
    "up to now , any excess in the yield of the drell  yan process with high - energy invariant mass of the lepton pairs remains the clearest indication of possibile production of a new heavy neutral boson at the hadron colliders .",
    "therefore , we will first concentrate on consideration of the production and decay of neutral bosons , where full kinematics is experimentally reconstructible . in what follows",
    "we will use the comphep / calchep package @xcite for the numerical calculations of various distributions for the inclusive processes @xmath62 and @xmath63 with a cteq6 m choice for the proton parton distribution set at @xmath64  tev . for both final leptons",

    "the reduced decay amplitude @xmath119 is only a function of @xmath111 and the helicities of the outgoing particles .",
    "it does not dependent on the azimuthal @xmath106 and polar @xmath105 angles .",
    "the @xmath105 dependence is concentrated only in the well - known @xmath120-functions @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , the absolute value of the dijet rapidity difference is related to the polar scattering angle @xmath105 with respect to the beam axis by the formula @xmath122\\ge 0 $ ] and is invariant under boosts along the beam direction .",
    "the choice of the other variable @xmath123 is motivated by the fact that the distribution of the rutherford scattering is flat in this variable .",
    "these variables allow systematic consideration of angular decay distributions of resonances with different spins and different interactions with partons .",
    "the simplest case of the resonance production of a ( pseudo)scalar particle @xmath124 with spin 0 in the @xmath111-channel leads to a uniform decay distribution in the scattering angle @xmath125 the spin-1/2 fermion resonance , like an excited quark @xmath126 , leads to asymmetric decay distributions for the given spin parton configurations @xmath127 however , the choice of the variables which depend on the absolute value of @xmath128 cancels out the apparent dependence on @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , both distributions ( [ g12 ] ) for dijet events look like uniform distributions in @xmath129 and @xmath130 according to the simple formula @xmath131 the uniform distribution leads to kinematical peaks at the small values @xmath132 ( the dotted curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) and @xmath133 ( the dotted curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath134    there are two different possibilities for spin-1 resonances .",
    "the gauge bosons , which are associated with additional @xmath135 gauge symmetry ( or transform under the adjoint representation of the extra gauge group ) , are generally called @xmath136 particles .",
    "they have minimal gauge interactions with the known light fermions ( see eqs .",
    "( [ zed ] ) and ( [ w ] ) ) , which preserve the fermion chiralities and possess maximal helicities @xmath137 . at a symmetric @xmath95 collider , like the lhc",
    ", such interactions lead to the symmetric angular distribution ( [ gll ] ) of the decay products over the polar angle @xmath105 : @xmath138 similar to the uniform distribution ( [ g0 ] ) , this one also leads to kinematical peaks at small values of @xmath132 ( the dash - dotted curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) and @xmath133 ( the dash - dotted curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath139 another possibility is the resonance production and decay of new longitudinal spin-1 bosons with helicity @xmath140 .",
    "these bosons arise in many extensions @xcite of sm which solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "they are transformed as doublets @xmath141 under the fundamental representation of the sm @xmath142 group like the sm higgs boson .",
    "they are above - mentioned extra chiral bosons ( see ( [ master ] ) ) .",
    "while the @xmath2 bosons with helicities @xmath137 are produced in left(right)-handed quark and right(left)-handed antiquark fusion , the longitudinal @xmath0 bosons can be produced through the anomalous chiral couplings with the ordinary light fermions in left - handed or right - handed quark - antiquark fusion @xcite . as already noted before , these anomalous couplings lead to a different angular distribution of the resonance decay @xmath143 as has already been noted for the dilepton case the absence of the constant term in ( [ glr11 ] ) results in novel experimental signatures .",
    "first of all , the uniform distribution ( [ g0 ] ) for scalar and spin-1/2 particles and the distribution ( [ gll11 ] ) for gauge vector bosons with minimal coupling include a nonzero constant term , which leads to a kinematic singularity in the transverse momentum distribution of the final parton ( as for charged leptons , see ( [ 1/cos ] ) and ( [ narrow ] ) ) .",
    "after smearing of the resonance finite width the singularity is transformed into the well - known jacobian peak ( the dash - dotted curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) .",
    "the analytic expression of the @xmath79 distribution describing the jacobian peak with finite width can be found in @xcite . using the same method one can derive an analogous distribution for the excited bosons ( the solid curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) .",
    "@xmath144 in contrast to the previous case , the pole in the decay distribution of the excited bosons is canceled out and the final parton @xmath145 distribution has a broad smooth hump @xcite with a maximum at @xmath146 below the kinematic endpoint @xmath80 instead of a sharp jacobian peak , which obscures their experimental identification as resonances .",
    "therefore , the transverse jet momentum is not the appropriate variable for the excited boson search .",
    "another striking feature of the distribution ( [ glr11 ] ) is the forbidden decay direction perpendicular to the boost of the excited boson in the rest frame of the latter ( the collins  soper frame @xcite ) .",
    "it leads to a profound dip at @xmath147 in the collins  soper frame @xcite in comparison with the gauge boson distribution ( the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] ) .",
    "similar dips also occur at the small values @xmath132 @xcite ( the solid curve in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) and @xmath133 ( the solid curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] ) @xmath148 it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] that the excited bosons have a unique signature in the angular distributions .",
    "they manifest themselves through the absolute minima at the small values @xmath132 and @xmath133 and absolute maxima right away from the origin .",
    "so , the rapidity difference distribution reaches the absolute maximum at @xmath149 and at @xmath150 for the angular distribution in the dijet variable @xmath130 .",
    "these features will be considered below in more detail . in order to have more practical analysis , it is convenient to use equidistant binning in @xmath151 @xcite , which corresponds to periodic cell granularity of the calorimeter in @xmath152 . in this case the smooth @xmath130-spectra ( see eqs .",
    "( [ dy1prime ] ) and ( [ dy1star ] ) ) are transformed into histograms with the maximum in the lowest bin for the gauge bosons with the minimal coupling and with the maximum in the bin containing the value @xmath153 for the excited bosons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ) .    using distributions in ( pseudo)rapidity and @xmath130",
    "one can construct two useful ratios of numbers of events @xmath154 measured under specified experimental constraints schematically given below in brackets .",
    "the first is the wide - angle to small - angle ratio @xmath155 and the second is centrality or the @xmath152-ratio of both jets @xmath156    the ratios are less affected by the systematic uncertainties and can be used for searching for new physics in dijet data . to understand how they work , let us suppose that one has found some bump in the experimental dijet invariant mass distribution .",
    "then we can compare the angular distributions for `` on - peak '' events ( or events comprising the bump ) and `` off - peak '' events ( or events far away from the bump ) , using the aforementioned ratios . at the moment",
    "we ignore the complications of experimental separation of `` on - peak '' events from the `` off - peak '' ones .",
    "since the qcd background is dominated by the rutherford - like distribution , we can consider , as an approximation , a simple case where the qcd dijet @xmath130-distribution is flat .",
    "it means that for the selected equal kinematical regions @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) , the ratio @xmath159 for the `` off - peak '' events should be approximately one and does not depend on the dijet mass . when the `` on - peak '' events originate from the new physics and have the angular distribution different from the one predicted in qcd , the ratio @xmath159 should deviate from one . due to an excess at small @xmath130 values",
    "irrespectiveof the maximal @xmath130-value ( in our case equals to @xmath160 ) one has @xmath161 for all known exotic models , except the excited bosons , when one expects @xmath162 .    in order to emphasize the effect of the excited bosons ( to increase sensitivity to these bosons ) , we need to choose a value of @xmath160 , which makes the ratio as small as possible @xmath163 here @xmath164 and @xmath165 denotes the number of events generated by the new physics in the regions @xmath166 and @xmath167 , respectively .",
    "simple integration gives the qcd contribution @xmath168 .",
    "simialr integrations of the @xmath130-distribution ( [ dy1star ] ) in @xmath166 and @xmath167 give @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively .",
    "therefore , due to the monotonic increase of the distribution ( [ dy1star ] ) to the maximum at @xmath150 it is possible to reach the minimal value for ( [ minchi ] ) with the parameters @xmath171 and @xmath172 . in our `` ideal '' case",
    "these parameters are optimal for the search for excited bosons with the ratio ( [ wide - small ] ) .",
    "the larger value @xmath173{2}-1)\\approx 3.85 $ ] will lead to a compensation of the contributions from the low and high @xmath130-parts ( @xmath174 ) , and @xmath175 again . for the qcd generated dijets the centrality ratio @xmath176 ( [ centrality ] ) is also almost constant and should not depend on the dijet invariant mass when the parameters @xmath160 and @xmath177 are fixed .",
    "when a dijet new - physics signal takes place , this ratio could deviate from its constant value .",
    "signal events for almost all exotic models are expected in the central ( pseudo)rapidity region .",
    "therefore , one could see a bump in the @xmath176 distribution as a function of the dijet mass .",
    "contrariwise , the signal from the excited bosons could lead to a novel signature : instead of the bump one will have a dip in the distribution at the resonance mass .",
    "to investigate quantitatively this possibility we have again used the comphep package @xcite , which was extended with the excited bosons model of @xcite . in particular ,",
    "two dimensional pseudorapidity distributions were generated for `` @xmath178 '' processes proceeding through the gauge @xmath48 and excited @xmath7 boson resonances with the same mass 550 gev@xmath6 at @xmath96  tev @xmath95 collider ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eta2dim ] ) .",
    "the cteq6l parton distribution functions were used . for both final jets we impose cuts on the pseudorapidity @xmath179 and the transverse momentum @xmath180  gev/@xmath181 .    to minimize the potential differences in jet response and efficiency of jet registration between the _ inner _ and _ outer _ dijet events one can choose the central region of the calorimeter @xmath182 . using calculations given in the scatter plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eta2dim ] ) one can estimate the centrality ratios ( [ centrality ] ) for the gauge and excited bosons @xmath183 the dramatic difference between these two numbers is clearly seen , it should lead to the corresponding experimental signature .",
    "since the qcd ratio @xmath184 is located _ right between _ the numbers , the gauge bosons with the minimal coupling will lead to an increase in the qcd ratio at the resonance mass , while the excited bosons should decrease the ratio .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a hint of this type of the novel signature can be seen in the low - statistics distribution of the @xmath152-ratio versus the dijet invariant mass in the atlas data in approximately the same mass range , @xmath185  gev , as for the resonance bump in the dijet events  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , one should stress that the extensions of the `` signal region '' up to @xmath186 and the central region up to @xmath187 do not change drastically the qcd ratio @xmath188 , but dilute the signal from the excited bosons since @xmath189 . in order to increase the sensitivity to the excited bosons one can consider the centrality ratio only for the dijet events with the opposite pseudorapidities @xmath190 ( the hatched regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta2dim ] ) . in this case",
    "the difference between @xmath191 and @xmath192 increases @xmath193 but we lose half of the statistics .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to consider the distribution in @xmath194 for the events in the rectangle region @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the cut @xmath197 is necessary to reduce the effect of the parton distribution functions on different @xmath198 bins .",
    "the corresponding centrality ratio @xmath199 is defined as @xmath200 the normalized histograms of the @xmath198-spectra and the theoretical curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta1 ] for the following parameters values : @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the theoretical distributions describe very well the above - mentioned simulation data . in the same way",
    "as was done for the @xmath130-distribution of the excited bosons one can maximize the deviation of @xmath203 from the qcd ratio @xmath204 .",
    "one finds the desired minimum of @xmath203 , which corresponds to the maximal deviation from qcd , for @xmath202 , @xmath205 and @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "in this review phenomenological consequences of the standard model extension by means of new spin-1 chiral fields with the internal quantum numbers of the electroweak higgs doublets are summarized .",
    "it is worth stressing that the new type of spin-1 chiral bosons can exist .",
    "they are well motivated from the point of view of the hierarchy problem and are predicted by at least three different classes of theories that represent different approaches to explanation of the relative lightness of the higgs doublets .",
    "the decay distributions of the chiral bosons differ drastically from the distributions of the known gauge bosons and can be distinguished from others .",
