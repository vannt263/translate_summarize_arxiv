    "the development in recent years of an improved staggered fermion formulation @xcite has made unquenched numerical lattice qcd simulations possible at realistically small quark masses .",
    "the resulting impressive agreement between the calculated parameters of qcd phenomenology and their experimental values @xcite ( along with predictions for quantities not yet measured experimentally @xcite ) indicates that the long - time dream of being able to do high - precision lattice qcd calculations is now becoming reality .",
    "however , the advantageous properties of staggered fermions for numerical implementation are currently offset by unresolved problematic issues at the conceptual / theoretical level . in particular",
    ", there is concern @xcite about the use of the fourth root of the staggered fermion determinant to represent the fermion determinant of a single dynamical ( sea ) quark .",
    "a number of works have appeared recently addressing this concern via theoretical considerations @xcite , derivations of predictions that can be used to test its viability @xcite , and various numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "the present paper is intended as another theoretical contribution in this direction .",
    "a staggered fermion is a lattice formulation of four continuum fermion flavours , nowadays called `` tastes '' ( to distinguish them from the actual quark flavours ) .",
    "the fermion determinant for a single quark flavour in this framework is represented by a rooted determinant @xmath4 .",
    "while this formally goes over to the determinant for a single quark flavour in the continuum limit , the concern regarding this prescription is that it does not fit in an obvious way into the framework of local lattice field theory at non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "the lattice model might therefore not be in the right universality class to reproduce qcd .",
    "this raises the question of whether the dynamical staggered fermion formulation is a first principles approach to qcd or simply a phenomenological model which describes qcd very well in a certain regime .",
    "one way to establish that the universality class is the right one would be to show that there is a viable ( and in particular , local ) single - flavour lattice dirac operator @xmath0 such that @xcite ( detd_staggered)^1/4=detd [ 1.1 ] this would imply equivalence between the dynamical staggered fermion formulation and the manifestly local formulation with sea quarks described by @xmath0 . ( to avoid unitarity issues , @xmath0 , with suitably adjusted bare mass , should then also be used as the dirac operator for the valence quarks . )",
    "we will refer to ( [ 1.1 ] ) as the staggered determinant relation ( sdr ) in the following .",
    "the most direct attempt at a solution to the sdr is simply to take @xmath5 .",
    "this is essentially the approach taken by jansen and collaborators in ref.@xcite .",
    "more precisely , they considered the operator m=((d_staggered)^d_staggered)^1/2|_even  sites [ 1.2 ] for which @xmath6 since @xmath7 couples lattice sites by even - to - even and odd - to - odd .",
    "thus @xmath8 is a candidate operator for @xmath0 in the case where @xmath9 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) , i.e. the case of two degenerate quark flavours .",
    "however , this operator was found to have unacceptable locality behaviour : it is exponentially local ( for bare mass @xmath10 ) , but the localisation range is @xmath11 and thus fails to vanish in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this negative result of ref.@xcite is unsurprising , since the operator ( [ 1.2 ] ) does not take account of the staggered fermion taste structure .",
    "the staggered fermion action can be viewed as consisting of naive fermion actions for four fermion species ( the tastes ) , together with terms that couple these , with the latter formally vanishing for @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that , in attempting to find a local , single - flavour lattice dirac operator satisfying the sdr , one should consider operators of the form d=+w+m [ 1.3 ] where @xmath12 is the ( massless ) naive lattice dirac operator , and @xmath13 is a term which formally vanishes for @xmath3 and whose role is to take account of the taste - mixing in @xmath14 . in this paper , working in the flavour field representation of staggered fermions @xcite , we show that , in the _ free field case _ , there is a natural candidate @xmath0 of the form ( [ 1.3 ] ) which satisfies the sdr .",
    "the @xmath13 operator , although formally vanishing for @xmath3 , turns out to involve a square root , so its locality status is not immediately clear .",
    "we show , however , that the operator does have acceptable locality behaviour : exponentially local , with localisation range vanishing @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "our operator can be gauged ( i.e. coupled to the link variables ) in a variety of ways .",
    "however , for reasons which we will discuss later , it is most unlikely that a gauging of this operator exists such that the sdr continues to hold in the interacting case . our operator should therefore be regarded as a prototype , i.e. a first step on a path to constructing more sophisticated operators which have a chance of satisfying the sdr in the full interacting case .",
    "of course , there is no a priori guarantee that a viable lattice dirac operator satisfying the sdr actually exists in the interacting case , so other approaches should also be considered .",
    "one possibility is the following : if there is a single - flavour @xmath0 such that the effect of including the determinant ratio @xmath15 in the lattice qcd functional integral is simply to renormalise the bare coupling constant ( just as dynamical heavy quarks do @xcite ) , then representing the sea quark determinant by @xmath4 is equivalent to representing it by @xmath16 together with a shift in the bare coupling .",
    "since the latter description is manifestly local , this is another way in which the locality issue could be positively resolved .",
    "the prospects for this , and the properties that such a @xmath0 would be expected to have , are also discussed in some detail in this paper .",
    "the problem of finding such a @xmath0 is seen to be essentially equivalent to the problem of finding a solution to a generalised version of the sdr .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "after a general discussion of the problem of finding viable solutions to the sdr , we arrive at our free field candidate @xmath0 in  2 . in ",
    "3 we prove that this operator has the good locality behaviour mentioned earlier . our argument is entirely analytic and the techniques are of a generally applicable nature ; we also apply them to give a new derivation of the negative locality result for the operator considered previously by jansen and collaborators @xcite .",
    "( their argument in the free field case had a numerical as well as analytic component . )",
    "we conclude in  4 with a discussion of the issues and prospects for the interacting case .",
    "for concreteness we specialise to 4 spacetime dimensions in this section ( everything generalises straightforwardly to arbitrary even dimensions ) . the usual staggered fermion action , obtained via spin - diagonalisation of the the naive action @xcite , is @xmath17 where the staggered dirac operator is given by d_st=^_+m [ 2.1 ] with @xmath18 and @xmath19 the symmetrised gauge - covariant difference operator .",
    "the usual flavour ( i.e. taste ) identification comes about by considering the free field propagator : it has 4 poles , and the momentum space brillouin zone is divided into 4 subregions , each containing a single pole , with the momenta in each of these subregions being interpreted as the momenta of different fermion tastes .",
    "an alternative , and conceptually more appealing way to identify the tastes is provided by the flavour ( taste ) field representation of the staggered fermion action derived in @xcite . in this representation",
    "the taste fields are manifest from the beginning in the fermion action .",
    "the taste fields live on the blocked lattice ( spacing=@xmath20 ) , whereas the lattice paths and link variables which specify the gauging of the action are those of the original lattice .",
    "the action in general gauge background does not have a simple expression in this setting though , making it more difficult to work with in practise .",
    "however , in the free field case the action does have a simple expression . denoting the staggered dirac operator in the taste field representation by @xmath21 ,",
    "it can be written in the free field case as @xcite d_stt^free=(^ ) _",
    "+ i(_5^)_+m [ 2.2 ] where now the ( free field ) difference operators are on the blocked lattice ; @xmath22 ( so that @xmath23 is @xmath24 times the blocked lattice laplace operator ) , and @xmath25 is a hermitian representation of the dirac @xmath26-algebra on taste space @xmath27 . in ( [ 2.2 ] ) is usually written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a hermitian representation of the dirac @xmath26-algebra on taste space .",
    "note that @xmath30 defines another ( equivalent ) hermitian representation of this algebra . ]",
    "the importance of taking account of taste structure when attempting to find a solution @xmath0 to the sdr can now be seen in the free field case as follows .",
    "the @xmath26-matrix representation @xmath25 in ( [ 2.2 ] ) can be chosen such that the diagonal matrix elements in each of the @xmath31 s all vanish .",
    "then the taste - mixing terms in the free field lagrangian correspond to the terms with @xmath31 s in the free field dirac operator ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if the taste - mixing terms are `` turned off '' the free field dirac operator reduces to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the ( massless ) free field naive dirac operator and @xmath34 is the identity matrix on taste space .",
    "consequently , ( detd_st^free)^1/2det(+m 0  0 + m),(detd_st^free)^1/4det(+m ) [ 2.3 ] or , alternatively , ( detd_st^free)^1/2&&det ( 0 ) + ( detd_st^free)^1/4&&det ( ) . [ 2.4 ] in the former case the fractional powers of @xmath35 become determinants of ultra - local lattice dirac operators , while in the latter case they become determinants of operators which can not be expected to have good locality properties .",
    "if we now imagine turning back on the taste - mixing terms , there is reason to hope that there will be corresponding deformations of @xmath36 or @xmath37 into some two - taste lattice dirac operator @xmath38 or single - taste @xmath0 , respectively , which continues to have good locality behaviour , such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "if a solution @xmath0 to the sdr , or a solution @xmath38 to the version of the sdr with with fractional power @xmath41 of the staggered fermion determinant , has been constructed `` blindly '' without taking account of the taste structure of the staggered fermion formulation , it can happen that when taste - mixing terms are turned off in the free field case the scenario ( [ 2.4 ] ) arises ; then it is to be expected that the @xmath0 or @xmath38 have bad locality behaviour .",
    "in fact this is essentially the situation for the solution @xmath42 considered in @xcite , and the negative locality result found there is therefore unsurprising .",
    "however , the possibility ( [ 2.3 ] ) gives hope of doing better than this , at least in the free field case.s and @xmath43 s in ( [ 2.2 ] ) but has a more complicated structure @xcite . ]    in light of ( [ 2.3 ] ) , when attempting to find a viable @xmath0 in the free field case it is natural to consider dirac operators of the form d=^_+w + m [ 2.6 ] on the blocked lattice , where the purpose of @xmath44 is to take account of the taste - mixing terms in the staggered dirac operator .",
    "in particular , @xmath13 should formally vanish @xmath45 for @xmath3 , and should lift the species doubling of the naive dirac operator . in other words , @xmath44 is to be a wilson - type term .",
    "a feature of the free field staggered dirac operator ( [ 2.2 ] ) in the taste field representation , which is very useful in this context , is that @xmath46 is trivial in spinor@xmath47flavour space : ( d_stt^free)^d_stt^free= ( -^2+_(_)^2+(2am)^2 ) ( * 1 * ) [ 2.7 ] on the other hand , for a free field operator of the form ( [ 2.6 ] ) we have d^d= ( -^2+(w+2am)^2 ) * 1 * [ 2.8 ] trivial in spinor space . comparing ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) , and noting that @xmath48 ( assuming @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 ( assuming @xmath51 ) , we immediately see that a sufficient criteria for the desired determinant relation @xmath52 to be satisfied is ( w+2am)^2=_(_)^2+(2am)^2 . [ 2.9 ] this has the solution w=  -  2 am , [ 2.10 ] which clearly has the required properties for @xmath44 to be wilson - type term ( i.e. @xmath13 lifts species doubling and formally vanishes @xmath45 for @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus we have arrived at a free field solution @xmath0 to the sdr ( [ 1.1 ] ) . substituting ( [ 2.10 ] ) into ( [ 2.6 ] ) we get the expression d=^_+ .",
    "[ 2.11 ] note that turning off the taste - mixing terms in the free field staggered fermion action , which , as pointed out previously , corresponds to putting @xmath53 in ( [ 2.2 ] ) , has the same effect as putting @xmath54 . by ( [ 2.11 ] )",
    "this gives @xmath55 ( for @xmath51 ) ; thus we have a realisation of the scenario ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "however , because of the square root in ( [ 2.11 ] ) , it is not immediately clear that good locality behaviour of @xmath0 , anticipated in our earlier discussion , is realised .",
    "in fact this square root operator has some similarity with the free field square root operator considered by jansen and collaborators in @xcite , which turned out to have unacceptable locality behaviour .",
    "nevertheless , we show in the next section that our operator does have good locality behaviour .",
    "the reason why its behaviour is different from the operator in @xcite is a bit subtle , and to elucidate this we also provide in the next section a new derivation of the negative locality result of @xcite which reveals the origin of the different behaviours .",
    "we remark that other , ultra - local solutions to the sdr exist in the free field case . using @xmath56 ( [ 2.7 ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath57 and it follows that the free field sdr is satisfied , e.g. , by @xmath58 acting on scalar grassmann fields on the lattice .",
    "other examples of ultra - local solutions are easily constructed",
    ". however , these are unattractive options since they do not have the form of a lattice dirac operator .",
    "in this section we work in arbitrary spacetime dimension @xmath59 and show that the free field operator [ 3.1 ] on lattice with spacing @xmath60 is exponentially local with localisation range vanishing @xmath2 for @xmath3 ; then @xmath0 in ( [ 2.11 ] ) obviously has this same locality behaviour on the blocked lattice .",
    "the argument proceeds in several steps .",
    "first , we specialise to @xmath61 dimension and write  ( x , y)&=&_-^  e^ip(x - y)/a + & = & _ |z|=1  z^|x - y|/a + & = & _ |z|=1  z^|x - y|/a [ 3.2 ] ( the integral is counter - clockwise around the unit circle in the complex plane and we have set @xmath62 with `` @xmath63 '' if @xmath64 and `` @xmath65 '' if @xmath66 ; for @xmath67 either choice can be used . )",
    "the square root @xmath68 is holomorphic after making a cut in @xmath69 ; we choose the cut to be the half - line of negative real numbers @xmath70 .",
    "then , by the residue theorem , the circle around which the integral in ( [ 3.2 ] ) is performed can be shrunk to a closed loop around the region containing the @xmath71 s for which @xmath72 , where f(z)=z^-2((am)^2z^2+(z-1)^4 ) [ 3.3 ] is the function inside the square root in ( [ 3.2 ] ) , since outside this region ( and away from @xmath73 ) @xmath74 is holomorphic .",
    "the excluded @xmath71 s are are found as follows : & & f(z)=-  _ + + & &  ( z-1)^4+((am)^2+)z^2=0 + & &  ( ( z-1)^2+i  z ) ( ( z-1)^2-i  z)=0 [ 3.4 ] for given @xmath75 there are 4 solutions ; we are only interested in the ones with @xmath76 and these are @xmath77 where z_=1-s0,[3.5 ] thus the @xmath71 s for which @xmath78 and @xmath76 form curves inside the unit circle in @xmath79 , parameterised by ( [ 3.5 ] ) with @xmath80 .",
    "it is useful to re - parameterise these curves as follows .",
    "we introduce t=1-  ; [ 3.6 ] note that this is a strictly decreasing function of @xmath81 with @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 . after a little calculation ( [ 3.5 ] ) can be re - expressed in terms of @xmath86 as z_(t)=ti(1-t)t0,1[3.7 ] the @xmath71 s for which @xmath78 and @xmath76 are now parameterised by the curves @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath89 where @xmath90 is given by setting @xmath91 in ( [ 3.6 ] ) ; we write this out explicitly for future reference : t_am=1-  . [ 3.8 ] these curves , which we denote by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , lie in the lower- and upper half - planes of @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "they have a common limit point at @xmath94 .",
    "see fig.[frp1 ] .",
    "@xmath95    according to the residue theorem , the integral ( [ 3.2 ] ) remains unchanged when the unit circle is shrunk to a closed curve @xmath96 around @xmath97 . in the limit this reduces to an integral over @xmath98 itself , with a factor of 2 to take account of the fact that @xmath96 goes along @xmath99 twice , with opposite orientations .",

    "is not sufficiently large , e.g. if @xmath67 , then the curve around which the integral is performed can not be completely shrunk to @xmath98  a small detour around @xmath102 must be included .",
    "this case is more subtle , and we do not consider it here since it is not needed to derive the advertised locality result . ] then , using obvious symmetries , the integral can be seen to be @xmath103 the _ real part _ of the integral over @xmath104 .",
    "( the integrals over @xmath92 and @xmath104 are complex conjugate , so the imaginary parts cancel out as they should . )",
    "the square root @xmath105 in the integral then reduces to @xmath106 with the explicit expression for @xmath107 determined below and the sign determined to be `` @xmath65 '' .",
    "thus ( [ 3.2 ] ) reduces to  ( x , y)=_0^t_amdt ||  re(z_-(t)^|x - y|/a-1 ) [ 3.9 ] recalling that the solution to @xmath108 can be written as ( [ 3.5 ] ) with @xmath109 , and noting that the relation between @xmath81 and @xmath86 in ( [ 3.6 ] ) can be inverted to give @xmath110 , we find =  . [ 3.10 ] the sign in @xmath106 can be determined by considering @xmath111 for @xmath71 near zero . writing @xmath112 we have @xmath113 ; hence , recalling that we have chosen the cut @xmath114 to define the square root , @xmath115 . from this",
    "it is straightforward to see that the sign in @xmath106 in the integral over @xmath104 is `` @xmath65 '' , and this is the origin of the minus sign in ( [ 3.9 ] ) .",
    "explicit expressions for the remaining ingredients in the integrand in ( [ 3.9 ] ) are readily found from ( [ 3.7 ] ) :     for @xmath84 in @xmath116 and @xmath117 are compensated in ( [ 3.9 ] ) by powers of @xmath118 in @xmath119 provided @xmath120 , which we henceforth assume to be the case .",
    "( this is the criterion alluded to above . )",
    "we can now use ( [ 3.9 ] ) to draw conclusions about the exponential decay of @xmath121 .",
    "explicit evaluation of the integral in ( [ 3.9 ] ) will not be needed for this , so we do not attempt to perform it here .    for fixed @xmath122 and",

    "[ 3.13 ] consequently , using ( [ 3.11 ] ) , the magnitude of the exponential decay of @xmath121 for small @xmath60 ( i.e. @xmath128 ) is found to be    & = & ( 1-+o(am))^1/ ^|x - y|/2 + & & ( e^-)^|x - y|/2 = e^-  |x - y| [ 3.14 ] thus the localisation range for the exponential decay of @xmath121 is seen to be @xmath129 .",
    "we now supplement the preceding with a bound on @xmath130 which allows to check that the integral in ( [ 3.9 ] ) does not give rise to other factors which mask the exponential decay when @xmath131 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath132 . from ( [ 3.10])([3.11 ] ) we see that for @xmath133 $ ] ||,,|z_-(t)| [ 3.15 ] and it follows from ( [ 3.9 ] ) that |  ( x , y)| & & _ 0^t_amdt()^-3 + & = & ( t_am)^|x - y|/2a [ 3.16 ] for @xmath128 the exponential factor here reduces as in ( [ 3.14 ] ) to give the same decay found earlier .",

    "thus we reproduce the general finding of @xcite for the locality behaviour of this free field operator . in eqn.(3.11 ) of @xcite the integration range for @xmath179 ( after a change of variables @xmath180 ) is @xmath181 .",
    "but since @xmath182 this gives precisely 1/2 of what the integration over @xmath183 would give .",
    "hence @xmath184 so the locality result derived above applies . ]",
    "the origin of the different locality behaviour of our operator and the free field operator considered in @xcite is now apparent : the exponential decay in @xmath61 dimension , which , as we have seen , is the same as the decay along a coordinate axis in general @xmath59 dimensions , is given in both cases by @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the point on the `` exclusion curves '' in fig.[frp1 ] ( our case ) or fig.[frp2 ] ( the case of ref.@xcite ) which is closest to the unit circle . in our case ,",

    "the essential difference is that the leading @xmath60-dependent term inside the bracket in ( [ 3.28 ] ) is @xmath189 whereas the corresponding leading term in ( [ 3.29 ] ) is @xmath190 .",
    "this leads to the localisation range being @xmath2 in the former case and @xmath191 ( independent of @xmath60 ) in the latter .",
    "the former tends to zero for @xmath3 while the latter stays constant in this limit .",
    "we remark that the technique of writing the kernel @xmath192 of a free field lattice operator as an integral around a closed curve in the complex plane , and then attempting to shrink the curve as a way of deriving locality properties , was used previously in a different context in ref.@xcite .",
    "working in the flavour ( taste ) representation for staggered fermions , we have shown that in the free field case there is a simple and natural wilson - type lattice dirac operator @xmath0 on the blocked lattice , given by ( [ 2.11 ] ) , which satisfies @xmath193 and is exponentially local with localisation range vanishing @xmath194 for @xmath3 .",
    "the techniques developed to derive the free field locality result are of a generally applicable nature , and we also used them to give a new , purely analytic derivation of the negative locality result in @xcite . they can also be used to study free field locality properties of other lattice operators of current interest ; in particular , the overlap dirac operator @xcite , which is treated in a forthcoming paper @xcite .    our free field operator can be gauged , i.e. coupled to the link variables of the original lattice , in a variety of ways .",
    "the simplest way is to define link variables @xmath195 on the blocked lattice in terms of the link variables @xmath196 on the original lattice by v_(2x)=u_(2x)u_(2x+a ) [ 4.1 ] ( @xmath197=unit vector in the positive @xmath198-direction ) ; then the difference operators @xmath199 , @xmath43 on the blocked lattice in ( [ 2.11 ] ) can be coupled to @xmath195 in the usual way  this specifies the `` minimal gauging '' of our @xmath0 .",
    "however , the resulting operator can not be expected to satisfy the sdr in the interacting case . our argument in  2 does not carry over to this case ; it is specific to the free field case .",
    "regarding the possibility of gauging our operator such that the sdr does continue to hold in the interacting case , we note the following . the taste - mixing part of the staggered dirac operator leaves unbroken a u(1 ) subgroup of the continuum u(4 ) axial flavour symmetry .. ( if the mass matrix is not proportional to the identity operator then the interpretation of the u(1 ) symmetry is different . ) note that the u(1 ) symmetry is _ not _ the diagonal u(1 ) subgroup in u(4 ) .",
    "the latter , associated with the axial anomaly , is explicitly broken by the taste - mixing part of @xmath14 . ] in the taste representation , this symmetry can be expressed in the free field case as _",
    "5_5,d_stt=0 [ 4.2 ] with notations as in ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "this chiral symmetry protects staggered fermions against additive mass renormalisation @xcite .",
    "the sea quark effective action in dynamical staggered fermion simulations is @xmath200 , the same as for a usual staggered fermion modulo an overall factor @xmath201 .",
    "thus the protection against additive mass renormalisation is also present in this case .",
    "this situation would be difficult , if not impossible , to reconcile with the existence of a single - flavour @xmath0 satisfying the sdr unless the @xmath0 is also protected against additive mass renormalisation : if the bare mass is small then for staggered fermions the physical mass will also be small , whereas for a lattice fermion described by a @xmath0 which does not have a chiral symmetry the physical mass will be large due to the additive mass renormalisation induced by radiative corrections . since our @xmath0 is of wilson - dirac form , any gauged version of it will be afflicted with additive mass renormalisation , unless there is a very special choice of gauging which endows this @xmath0 with a new , hitherto undiscovered type of chiral symmetry .",
    "the latter seems very unlikely though , so most probably a gauged version of our @xmath0 satisfying the sdr simply does not exist .",
    "the symmetry corresponding to ( [ 4.2 ] ) for @xmath202 in the free field case is _",
    "[ 4.3 ] but , as noted in  2 , @xmath203 in the free field case , so ( [ 4.3 ] ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "this explains why it was possible to find a single - flavour @xmath0 without chiral symmetry but nevertheless satisfying the sdr in the free field case . in the interacting case",
    "@xmath202 is no longer @xmath204 and the gauged version of the symmetry ( [ 4.3 ] ) is a nontrivial property .",
    "although a gauged version of our @xmath0 satisfying the sdr is unlikely to exist , the free field locality result for it is still relevant as a general indication of the possibility of having local single - flavour dirac operators satisfying the sdr , and as a first step toward constructing more sophisticated operators which have a chance to be local ( also for @xmath205 ) and satisfy the sdr in the full interacting case . at present",
    "it is the only analytic positive locality result derived for a solution of the sdr in any gauge background ( the background in our case being the trivial one ) .",
    "the above discussion indicates that , for a viable @xmath0 to satisfy the sdr in the full interacting case , it should have an exact chiral - type symmetry ( presumably corresponding in some way to the aforementioned chiral symmetry of staggered fermions ) .",
    "the only such symmetry currently known for single - flavour lattice dirac operators is the lattice - deformed chiral symmetry @xcite possessed by operators satisfying the ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) relation @xcite and its generalisations @xcite .",
    "this suggests to look for free field solutions to the sdr which also satisfy the gw relation , in the hope that among these there may be a @xmath0 which can be gauged such that the sdr continues to hold in the interacting case .",
    "in fact this was already investigated by numerical means on finite lattices in ref.@xcite .",
    "the numerical results there appear to be encouraging .",
    "however , the problem can also be addressed analytically and when this is done difficulties become apparent .",
    "setting the lattice spacing of the blocked lattice to unity for convenience , the gw relation in its broad form is _",
    "5d+d_5=2d_5rd [ 4.4 ] where @xmath206 is an arbitrary local scalar hermitian operator . as noted at the end of  2 , a sufficient condition for the free field @xmath0 to satisfy the sdr is d^d=+m^2 [ 4.5 ] in the free field case , assuming @xmath207-hermiticity @xmath208 and exploiting the fact that solutions to ( [ 4.4 ] ) are of the form @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 , the most general solution to ( [ 4.4 ] ) is seen to be of the form d_gw=(1 + ) [ 4.6 ] where @xmath212 and @xmath13 are sums of scalar operators multiplied by an even number of @xmath26-matrices .",
    "straightforward algebra now shows that requiring this operator to satisfy ( [ 4.5 ] ) fixes the @xmath13 such that d_gw=^ _",
    "+  r(+m^2 ) [ 4.7 ] this is the general solution to ( [ 4.4])([4.5 ] ) in the free field case .",
    "the numerical solutions investigated in ref.@xcite are particular cases of this operator ( or more precisely , approximations to it on finite lattices ) with the @xmath212 s being scalar operators .",
    "the main interest here is in the case @xmath205 , since it is in the chiral limit that @xmath0 should have the chiral symmetry implied by the gw relation ( [ 4.4 ] ) .    in the simplest case where @xmath213 and @xmath214 , i.e. the usual symmetrised difference operator , @xmath215 reduces in the @xmath205 case to ^ _  +  [ 4.8 ] while this operator correctly reproduces the continuum free field dirac operator in the @xmath3 limit , it is most unlikely to have acceptable locality behaviour .",
    "the presence of the @xmath216 inside the square root in the general operator ( [ 4.7 ] ) makes it difficult to envisage that there exist @xmath212 s and a local @xmath206 for which this operator has acceptable locality behaviour either , in spite of the numerical indications from ref.@xcite .",
    "thus it would seem that the condition ( [ 4.5 ] ) , which is sufficient , but not necessary , for the sdr to be satisfied , is actually too restrictive to lead to a local operator @xmath0 satisfying both the sdr and gw relation .",
    "the preceding considerations indicate that finding a viable exact solution to the sdr in the interacting case is a difficult problem .",
    "however , to resolve the fourth root issue is is not actually necessary to have an exact solution ; it suffices to find a viable lattice dirac operator which satisfies the sdr _ approximately _ in the sense that the effective action difference d(u)=logdetd_st - logdetd [ 4.11 ] is effectively just a lattice yang - mills action for the gauge field . in this case , representing the quark determinant by @xmath217 is physically equivalent to representing it by @xmath16 together with a renormalisation of the bare coupling constant ( i.e. a shift in @xmath218 ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath219 has the same effect as the fermion determinant for dynamical heavy quarks @xcite . in connection with this",
    "it is useful to note that the perturbative expansion of a general single - flavour lattice fermion determinant has the form @xcite logdetd&=&(-log(am)^2+c_d)s_ym(a ) + _ n=2^(i_n(a;m)+v_n(a;am ) ) + & & [ 4.12 ] where @xmath220 is the continuum yang - mills action , @xmath221 is a non - local continuum functional of order @xmath222 in @xmath223 , and the @xmath224 s ( also nonlocal and of order @xmath222 in @xmath223 ) are terms which vanish for @xmath225 .",
    "the dependence on the specific choice of lattice dirac operator @xmath0 enters only through the numerical coefficient @xmath226 and the functions @xmath224 .",
    "( a gauge field - independent term which diverges for @xmath225 has been ignored in ( [ 4.12 ] ) . ) in fact the perturbative expansion of @xmath227 has the same form ( [ 4.12 ] ) as a single - flavour dirac operator @xcite . letting @xmath228 denote the coefficient @xmath226 in this case",
    ", it follows that the perturbative expansion of the effective action difference ( [ 4.11 ] ) has the form d(a)=(c_st - c_d)s_ym(a)+_n=2^w_n(a;am ) [ 4.13 ] with each @xmath229 vanishing for @xmath225 .",
    "thus it would seem that , in the perturbative setting at least , for @xmath128 the effective action difference is indeed just a yang - mills action for the gauge field , for any sensible choice of single - flavour @xmath0 .",
    "the situation is not this simple though  although they vanish for @xmath3 , the functions @xmath230 in ( [ 4.12 ] ) and @xmath231 in ( [ 4.13 ] ) still do affect the quantum continuum limit . at the perturbative level",
    "this is manifested in that feynman diagrams with vertices from these terms can be non - vanishing ; in fact divergent . to see this ,",
    "recall that the terms in the perturbative expansion of @xmath232 are given by 1-(fermion)-loop gluonic @xmath222-point functions .",
    "the internal propagators and vertices in these receive radiative corrections . in particular ,",
    "unless @xmath0 is protected by a chiral symmetry , the radiative corrections to the internal propagators give rise to a large additive mass renormalisation .",
    "since there is no corresponding effect from @xmath233 to cancel this , it will manifest itself in the divergence ( for @xmath225 ) of various feynman diagrams involving vertices from the `` irrelevant '' terms @xmath229 in the effective action difference ( [ 4.13 ] ) .",
    "thus the importance of @xmath0 having a chiral symmetry becomes clear in this context as well .",
    "in perturbative ( lattice ) qcd the renormalisations of interaction vertices are independent of the renormalisation of the fermion propagator and bare mass .",
    "thus ( [ 4.13 ] ) and the observations above would suggest that , for @xmath128 , the effective action difference @xmath234 is indeed essentially a yang - mills action when the single - flavour lattice dirac operator @xmath0 has an exact chiral symmetry ; e.g. , when @xmath0 is the overlap dirac operator . support for",
    "this hypothesis comes from a numerical study carried out in two dimensions in ref.@xcite . in two spacetime dimensions",
    "the perturbative expansion of @xmath232 is completely universal , modulo terms which vanish for @xmath225 @xcite ( this is a reflection of the fact that qcd in two dimensions is super - renormalisable ) .",
    "thus the first term in the right - hand side of the effective action difference ( [ 4.13 ] ) is absent in this case , and the hypothesis then states that representing the quark determinant by @xmath235 is equivalent to using @xmath236 ( with @xmath237 being the overlap dirac operator ) _ without _ any renormalisation of the bare coupling . if this hypothesis holds , then @xmath235 should coincide with @xmath236 for equilibrium gauge configurations of an ensemble generated by taking the probability weight to be @xmath238 . and",
    "this is precisely what was found to good accuracy in a numerical study in ref.@xcite .",
    "it must be remembered though that the perturbative picture is not the full picture .",
    "low - lying eigenvalues of the dirac operator are associated with long - range , low energy dynamics in qcd which is not captured by the perturbative framework . indeed ,",
    "numerical studies of the wilson fermion determinant in ref.@xcite show that the log of the determinant can not be modelled by a linear combination of local loop functionals ( i.e. functional of the form @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the product of the link variables around a closed lattice path @xmath241 ) ; in particular it can not be modelled by a local lattice ym action .",
    "however , the product of the dirac eigenvalues of magnitude @xmath242 _ does _ admit such a description @xcite .",
    "thus , the aforementioned hypothesis , coming from the perturbative considerations above , should be regarded as applying to the _ truncations _ of @xmath243 , @xmath16 , and the effective action difference @xmath219 , given by excluding the eigenvalues of magnitude @xmath244 .",
    "( a way to implement and study this truncation in the perturbative setting is mentioned in @xcite . )    specifically , defining @xmath245 and @xmath246 to be the products of the eigenvalues of @xmath0 of magnitudes @xmath242 , and @xmath244 , respectively , and splitting up the effective action difference into @xmath247 in the obvious way , the hypothesis can be stated as follows : `` when @xmath0 is the overlap dirac operator and @xmath248 then @xmath249 is essentially a local lattice ym action in 4 dimensions , and essentially vanishing in 2 dimensions . ''",
    "the question of whether @xmath219 itself is effectively a local ym action ( which would give a positive resolution of the fourth root issue if the answer is affirmative ) is then reduced to a question of whether or not @xmath250 is effectively zero",
    ". thus it would be highly desirable to numerically study @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and thereby @xmath250 , in equilibrium gauge backgrounds in 4 dimensions .",
    "we remark that , in 2 dimensions , combining the hypothesis that @xmath253 vanishes ( in 2 dim . ) with the numerical agreement @xcite between the full rooted staggered and overlap determinants implies that @xmath254 does indeed vanish in this case .    in 4 dimensions numerical studies have found that , after applying a uv - filtering procedure , there is good agreement between the low - lying eigenvalues of @xmath237 and @xmath233 ( modulo a four - fold degeneracy in the latter)@xcite . is intimately connected with having agreement between the low - lying eigenvalues of @xmath237 and @xmath233 . ] comparisons of the spectrum of @xmath233 with predictions of random matrix theory also back up this picture @xcite . while this does not by itself prove that @xmath254 vanishes , it is certainly compatible and suggestive of it .    while the numerical work in this direction may lead to a resolution of the fourth root issue at a practical level",
    ", one should ask whether it is possible to also get a resolution at the theoretical level in this approach .",
    "if it is possible it will probably happen as follows : ( i ) use renormalisation group arguments to justify a perturbative treatment of @xmath253 and verify the hypothesis that it is effectively a local lattice ym action .",
    "( ii ) by applying random matrix theory and theoretical implications of uv - filtering to the low - lying spectra of @xmath237 and @xmath233 show that @xmath254 is effectively zero when taking the quantum continuum limit .",
    "another interesting and promising approach to the fourth root issue has been given recently by shamir @xcite .",
    "a renormalisation group argument is used to express the free field staggered fermion action in the flavour ( taste ) representation on a lattice spacing @xmath255 as an action on a coarse lattice of spacing @xmath256 .",
    "this results in a decomposition of the staggered fermion determinant in the form det(d_st)=det(d_n)det(g_n^-1 ) [ 4.14 ] the operator @xmath257 encodes the low energy / long range dynamics of staggered fermions ; it decays exponentially with localisation range @xmath258 , satisfies a gw relation when @xmath205 , and becomes proportional to the identity matrix in flavour space in the large @xmath222 limit : @xmath259 .",
    "hence , in this limit det(d_st)^1/4=det(d_rg)det(g_^-1/4 ) . [ 4.15 ] the magnitude of the spectrum of each @xmath260 has a lower bound @xmath261 ; in units of the fine lattice spacing @xmath255 this blows up for large @xmath222 , so the expectation is that in a gauged version of this setting the effect of @xmath262 in ( [ 4.15 ] ) is exactly the same as that of the determinant of a heavy dynamical fermion : to simply renormalise the bare coupling parameter .",
    "it should be pointed out though that the @xmath263 limit leading to ( [ 4.15 ] ) can not actually be taken in practise  it corresponds to @xmath3 , but @xmath60 must remain non - zero since it is the spacing of the lattice on which the staggered fermion lives and the lattice qcd simulations are performed . therefore , in this approach one needs to remain at finite @xmath222 , i.e. the setting of ( [ 4.14 ] ) . for large finite @xmath222",
    "the operator @xmath257 is close to being diagonal in flavour space , but is not exactly diagonal .",
    "this is different from the situation in the present paper where we obtain a single - flavor candidate dirac operator already at non - zero lattice spacing . to fully resolve the fourth root issue in shamir s approach it is necessary to find an single - flavour lattice dirac operator @xmath264 such that adding @xmath265 to the lattice gauge field action does not affect the quantum continuum limit .",
    "shamir has a proposal for this operator @xmath264 @xcite .",
    "moreover , his approach has a definite possibility of being extended to the interacting case , although this remains a difficult challenge for future work .    an appealing feature of shamir s",
    "approach is that the gw chiral symmetries of @xmath257 and @xmath266 ( at @xmath205 ) originate in a clear and direct way from the chiral symmetry ( [ 4.2 ] ) of the staggered dirac operator .",
    "this also raises intriguing questions .",
    "the chiral symmetry of a gw dirac operator is generally anomalous ",
    "it gets broken by the fermion integration measure @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the chiral symmetry of @xmath233 gets broken spontaneously in the @xmath267 limit ( at least at strong coupling ) , and there is an associated goldstone meson @xcite . in connection with this",
    "we mention a potentially troubling aspect of the fourth root prescription which has been pointed out already by creutz @xcite : when the determinant for a single quark is represented by @xmath243 , what becomes of the goldstone meson associated with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of @xmath233 ?",
    "single - flavour dirac operators are not supposed to have spontaneously broken chiral symmetries .",
    "this and other intriguing issues for the fourth root prescription remain as an urgent topic for future work .    finally , we mention that a completely different approach to this issue , involving relating the fourth root prescription to local theories via a parameter deformation in a family of lattice theories in 6 spacetime dimensions , has been described by neuberger in ref.@xcite .",

    "<S> with the aim of resolving theoretical issues associated with the fourth root prescription for dynamical staggered fermions in lattice qcd simulations , we consider the problem of finding a viable lattice dirac operator @xmath0 such that @xmath1 . working in the flavour field representation we show that in the free field case there is a simple and natural candidate @xmath0 satisfying this relation , and we show that it has acceptable locality behaviour : exponentially local with localisation range vanishing @xmath2 for lattice spacing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> prospects for the interacting case are also discussed , although we do not solve this case here . </S>"
