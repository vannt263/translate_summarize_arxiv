    "the lack of inversion symmetry leads to a low - energy valley optical selection rule , with inter - band transitions around the kand k@xmath7valleys being coupled to left- and right - handed circularly polarized light  @xcite , respectively .",
    "soc together with the lack of inversion symmetry induces strong coupling between spin and valley of electrons .",

    "we adopted the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno method to relax forces on atoms below @xmath12 for different lattice constants and then obtain equilibrium geometries using the corresponding equation of state .",
    "maximally localized wannier functions  @xcite were constructed for the top fourteen valence bands ( including spin ) and bottom eight conduction bands using the wannier90 code  @xcite .",
    "projections over @xmath13-orbitals of the transition metal and @xmath14-orbitals of the chalcogens have been employed as starting points for the localization procedure . in order to compute accurately and inexpensively the optical properties of 2d tmds , we exploited wannier - function techniques  @xcite to interpolate the band structure on a very fine grid in momentum space .",
    "brillouin zone integrations were then carried out using the tetrahedron method  @xcite .",

    "filled circles denote the positions of saddle points .",
    "[ fig : contours ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] we show color maps of the energy difference @xmath205 , between the top valence band for spin-@xmath135 electrons , @xmath206 , and the bottom conduction band , @xmath207 , for spin-@xmath135 electrons .",
    "we recall that , by trs , the results for spin-@xmath134 electrons can be simply obtained from the results for spin-@xmath135 electrons by sending @xmath61 to @xmath208 , i.e. @xmath209 .",
    "we have checked that our numerics respects this important symmetry .",
    "contour lines of the same quantity are drawn at the critical energies corresponding to the vhss in the optical conductivity .",
    "for each critical energy we can identify the corresponding saddle point ( black filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] ) and the separatrix line in its neighborhood . after a careful inspection of the numerical data , we conclude that , for all 2d tmds studied in this work , the saddle points are located either along the high symmetry paths @xmath95-kand @xmath95-k@xmath7 , or _ very close to the @xmath95-mline_. in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] , the displacement of saddle points from the @xmath95-mline is well visible only in the case of @xmath24 .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "claim that in their dft study saddle points occur only along the @xmath95-k/@xmath95-k@xmath7directions .",
    "we believe that wannier interpolation is crucial to determine the location of saddle points with high accuracy , since this method gives the possibility to increase the @xmath61-space resolution much more efficiently than a brute - force dft method .",
    "we now note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt ] certain vhss in the optical response to left - handed light appear at the same photon energy in both spin channels .",
    "logarithmically large optical responses , however , occur at certain photon energies only in one spin channel .",
    "these facts can be explained with the following arguments .",
    "we claim that saddle points close to the @xmath95-mline yield identical photo - response in the two spin channels while saddle points along the @xmath95-k/@xmath95-k@xmath7directions yield a substantially spin - polarized optical response .",
    "this is due to the matrix elements involved in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spm ] ) .",
    "indeed , we can calculate the spin - resolved amplitude @xmath210 that enters the optical conductivity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spm ] ) , i.e. @xmath211 where the denominator is just a normalization factor .",
    "trs ensures the following relations @xmath212 between amplitudes for different spin orientations and/or light polarization .",
    "the quantity @xmath213 is shown in fig .  [ fig : polarization ] .",
    "for the same 2d tmds as in earlier figures .",
    "data are not shown in the neighborhood of the @xmath95 point due to numerical problems stemming from band crossings occurring at @xmath95.[fig : polarization ] ]    combining the information in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarization ] with that in fig .",
    "[ fig : contours ] , we conclude that saddle points along the @xmath95-k(@xmath95-k@xmath7 ) direction give rise to vhss only for left - handed ( right- handed ) light .",
    "this means that only one spin component is coupled to light at a given saddle point energy and the corresponding vhs yields a strongly spin - polarized photo - current . on the contrary , the matrix elements in eq",
    "are such that saddle points close to the @xmath95-mline couple equally to left- and right - handed light for both spin-@xmath135 and spin-@xmath134 electrons , so that the corresponding vhss occur at the same energy .",
    "in summary , we have presented a fully - relativistic ab - initio density - functional - theory study of the optical conductivity of 2d group - vib tmds .",
    "these calculations have been combined with the use of maximally localized wannier functions , which offer a computationally inexpensive strategy to reach exceptional @xmath195-space resolution .",
    "we have focussed on the photo - response of 2d tmds to circularly - polarized monochromatic light in a wide frequency range , presenting extensive numerical results for monolayer tmds involving molybdenum and tungsten combined with sulphur and selenium ( @xmath19 , @xmath24 , @xmath176 , and @xmath167 ) .",
    "we have been able to locate with high accuracy the positions of the points in @xmath195-space that are responsible for van hove singularities in the optical response .",
    "these have been found to occur either along the high - symmetry directions @xmath95-kand @xmath95-k@xmath7or very close to the @xmath95-mline .",
    "our spin - resolved study provides a route that can be followed experimentally to generate spin - polarized photo - excited carriers by employing circularly polarized light and 2d tmds .    in this article",
    "we have neglected electron - electron interactions beyond those described by the lda or gga - pbe exchange - correlation energy functional . as we have already mentioned above in sect .",
    "[ sec : bands ] , this implies the well - known `` gap problem '' , which can be corrected by including electron - electron interactions at the gw level  @xcite . on top of this",
    ", one has to keep in mind that low - dimensional systems display large excitonic corrections  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have calculated a gw energy gap @xmath214 and a gw+bethe salpeter exciton binding energy @xmath215 for @xmath19 ( @xmath216 and @xmath217 for @xmath176 ) .",
    "excitonic effects imply strong optical response at energies close to the gap .",
    "excitonic corrections , however , are not important only at low energies : indeed , they red shift optical absorption peaks related to saddle points . the line shape of such vhss in the optical absorbance is also affected by excitonic corrections , acquiring an asymmetric fano shape  @xcite .",
    "vhss dressed by excitonic effects have been recently observed in high - quality suspended @xmath19 devices  @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", a study of these effects on the spin - resolved optical conductivity tensor @xmath218 has not yet appeared in the literature and is well beyond the scope of the present work .",
