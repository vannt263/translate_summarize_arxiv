    "bayesian network ( bn ) is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph ( dag ) @xcite .",
    "bn can be used to learn causal relationships and gain understanding of a problem domain .",
    "it allows probabilistic beliefs to be updated automatically when new information becomes available .",
    "bn is also able to represent multi - attribute correlated variables and to perform relevant simulations or diagnoses .",
    "owing these advantages , it has been widely applied on the problem of reliability or safety analysis for both static and dynamic systems @xcite . in bn , conditional probability tables ( cpts ) should be defined to measure the relationships between variables .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that it is usually difficult to quantify the cpts due to the complexity @xcite .",
    "one of the most appropriate solutions to this problem is the noisy - or ( nor ) gate , which can be attributed to @xcite .",
    "traditional nor can only deal with the binary variables .",
    "@xcite extended nor for @xmath0-ary input and output variables , and arbitrary functions other than boolean or function can be used .",
    "but it has not taken into account the uncertainty on parameters and the state which often exists in practice . considering such uncertainty",
    ", @xcite proposed the imprecise extensions of noisy or ( imnor ) thereafter . nevertheless , there are still some problems for imnor which will be discussed in detail later",
    ".    the theory of belief functions , also called dempster  shafer theory ( dst ) , offers a mathematical framework for modeling uncertainty and imprecise information @xcite .",
    "belief functions are widely employed in various fields , such as data classification @xcite , data clustering @xcite , social network analysis @xcite and statistical estimation @xcite .",
    "the concept of evidential networks , which is a combination of belief function theory and bayesian network , is proposed to model system reliability with imprecise knowledge @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented another definition of evidential networks based on transferable belief model ( tbm ) @xcite , dempster - shafer rule of combination , and binary joint trees .",
    "the objective of this work is to enrich the existing nor structures by integrating several types of uncertainty . under the framework of belief functions ,",
    "the belief noisy - or ( bnor ) model is put forward .",
    "the uncertainty of variable states can be expressed by the power set of discernment frame .",
    "the uncertainty of parameters is described by probability intervals based on which the basic belief assignments are determined .",
    "the model can model causal connections among variables as well as taking random and epistemic uncertainty into account .",
    "the proposed bnor model can be implemented in evidential networks @xcite , and belief reasoning is proceeded through evoking junction tree inference algorithms @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the basic knowledge about noisy - or gate and dempster  shafer theory is briefly introduced .",
    "the bnor model is presented in detail in section 3 . in order to show the effectiveness of bnor in real practice",
    ", section 4 discusses about how to apply bnor on the problem of network reliability evaluation .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the final section .",
    "in this section some related preliminary knowledge will be presented .",
    "the definition of noisy - or gate will be described first , then some basis of belief function theory will be recalled .",
    "the noisy - or structure was introduced by @xcite to reduce the elicitation effort in building a bayesian network .",
    "the general properties of the noisy - or function and its generalizations were captured by @xcite in their definition of causal independence .",
    "let us consider a binary variable @xmath1 with @xmath0 binary parent variables @xmath2 ( see figure  [ xxxy]-a ) .",
    "these variables can be either  true \" @xmath3 or  false \" @xmath4 .",
    "each @xmath5 exerts its influence on @xmath1 independently . to build a bayesian network ,",
    "@xmath6 must be associated with a probability distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the number of independent parameters included in the complete specification of @xmath7 is @xmath8 .",
    "the noisy - or function is an attractive way where we can use fewer parameters to specify @xmath7 .",
    "the idea is to start with @xmath0 probability values @xmath9 , which is the probability that @xmath10 conditional on @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath14 probability @xmath9 is often called  link probability \" and illustrates the fact that the causal dependency between @xmath2 and @xmath1 can be inhibited . if the state of variable @xmath2 is @xmath15 , then there is chance @xmath16 that it is flipped to @xmath17 ; if @xmath2 is @xmath17 , then it stays with @xmath17 .",
    "denote the result of flipping ( or not ) @xmath2 by @xmath18 ( see figure  [ xxxy]-b ) , then    @xmath19    where the values of @xmath20 are either @xmath15 or @xmath17 .",
    "a noisy - or function is thus a disjunction of  noisy \" versions of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath21 be the set of @xmath2 whose state is  true \" , and @xmath22 be the set of @xmath2 which are  false \" .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 conditional on @xmath23 is @xmath24    we can see the number of independent parameters required for the conditional probability function is reduced from @xmath25 to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the following example shows how to create cpts by the use of nor gate .    *",
    "let us consider the alarm system ( see figure  [ alarm ] ) .",
    "both a burglar ( @xmath27 ) and an earthquake ( @xmath28 ) can set the alarm ( @xmath29 ) off but neither always do so .",
    "the mechanism of the burglar and earthquake is different , thus they can be regarded as independent causes .",
    "variable @xmath30 ( respectively , @xmath31 ) describes the result after flipping ( or not ) of @xmath27 ( respectively , @xmath28 ) .",
    "assume all variables are binary with values @xmath32 , where @xmath15 represents the corresponding event happens , while @xmath17 means not .",
    "apparently , @xmath29 is @xmath17 only if both the occurrence of burglar and earthquake do not evoke the alarm due to inhibition . using the noisy - or model , we can get ,",
    "@xmath33    the conditional probability on @xmath34 can be obtained easily :    @xmath35    the following cpt can be got using eqs .   and .",
    ".the conditional probability table . [ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ pignistictab ]    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]      from the experimental results , it can be concluded that when there is no epistemic uncertainty in the network , bnor degrades to the traditional bayesian method .",
    "however , if there indeed exists imperfect knowledge , bnor model can provide us more information in the form of lower bounds ( @xmath36 ) and upper bounds ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "a pessimistic decision can be made according to the @xmath36 value , which provides us the worst value of the network reliability .",
    "on the contrary , @xmath37 is the maximum degree of belief that can support the connectivity of the network , from which an optimistic decision can be made .",
    "these measures are of great value when we have to make a compromise between risks and costs .",
    "also these knowledge on the credal level can be transformed to the pignistic level through smets method .",
    "then common principles in decision theory such as the minimal expected cost ( risk ) criterion can be evoked .",
    "in this paper , the bnor model under the framework of belief functions , as an extension of the traditional nor model , is developed to express several kinds of uncertainty in the independent causal interactions . it is proved that bnor can be implemented to propagate uncertain information through employing the bayesian networks tools . in practice , bnor is more flexible than existing nor models because it offers a general bayesian framework that allows us to adopt the exact inference algorithm in their original form without modification , and then by adjusting necessary parameters to obtain results which satisfy the special requirements of engineers .",
    "finally , the application on the reliability evaluation problem of networked systems demonstrates the effectiveness of bnor model .",
    "bnor is applicable to systems with binary variables .",
    "an extension of bnor suitable to multi - value variables should be regarded as a future development .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty on link probabilities may not be given in the form of intervals in practice .",
    "how to take advantage of the independence of causal interactions with different types of uncertain knowledge is another considerable problem to be investigated .",
    "this paper mainly focuses on theoretical work .",
    "applications of bnor on more complex situations will be considered in the future .",
