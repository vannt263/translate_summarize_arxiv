    "the second statement implies the first because the chern character of a holomorphic ( and therefore algebraic ) bundle factors through the chow ring of algebraic varieties .",

    "the fact that the bundles are exhibited as a difference of two vector bundles , each of which is in turn a sum of explicit line bundles , suggests the use of monads , possibly combined with a twistor construction .",
    "this would involve a matrix of sections of line bundles .    a third idea , suggested to me by g. tian ,",
    "is pursued in the last section of this paper .",

    "we fix an integral ricci - flat khler form @xmath148 , and let @xmath197 denote a trivialisation of @xmath196 with normalisation as in ( [ omegatheta ] ) .",

    "in fact , the cayley cycles we deal with will be of the latter kind .",
    "cayley manifolds are not easy to find .",

    "we let @xmath304 denote the corresponding abelian variety .",
    "attempts to invoke twistor methods have not been successful so far . for example , n. hitchin pointed out that results of m. verbitsky make hyperkhler twistor spaces quite unsuitable .",
    "g. tian made the following suggestion : construct instantons by deformation ( using , say , the continuity method ) from a situation when they are known to exist .",
    "in fact , the complex structure described in the remark [ flip ] provides such a starting point .",
    "i close with a brief justification for this claim .    with respect to the above complex structure ,",
    "the bundles @xmath305 defined in the statement of theorem [ bundles ] are holomorphic , and furthermore ( using the ampleness of @xmath148 ) , the constant @xmath185 can be chosen large enough that @xmath306 can be embedded as a sub - bundle of @xmath307 .",
    "the quotient bundle can be identified with the difference bundle @xmath191 , which therefore has a holomorphic structure depending on the above embedding ; _ we now show that it is possible to arrange that @xmath191 , endowed with this structure , is polystable . _",
    "( by stability we shall mean @xmath308-stability w.r.to the polarisation @xmath148 .",
    "let us start by recalling that @xmath309 , and @xmath310 .",
    "choose a large enough integer @xmath311 such that @xmath312 that is very ample , and let @xmath313 be a general curve cut out by three sections of this line bundle .",
    "it follows from proposition [ miracle2 ] that @xmath314 , and will assume that @xmath185 is chosen such that @xmath315 .",
    "we next make the following assumption : @xmath316 which we will return to below .",
    "let @xmath317 denote a subspace of @xmath318 , chosen such that      consider now the evaluation map @xmath320 , and let @xmath321 be the kernel ; by construction @xmath321 fits in the exact sequence @xmath322 by butler s theorem ( @xcite ) , the restriction of @xmath321 to @xmath313 is stable , and this proves that @xmath321 itself is stable .",
    "we next choose a subspace @xmath323 of @xmath324 with similar properties and obtain a second stable bundle @xmath325 that fits in the sequence @xmath326 dualising , tensoring by suitable line bundles and adding the two sequences , we get @xmath327 where @xmath328 denotes the dual of @xmath321 and @xmath329 denotes the dual of @xmath325 , and we have used the assumption ( [ linsys ] ) , namely , @xmath330 . repeatedly using proposition [ miracle2 ]",
    "we see that the two summands in the last sum have the same slope .",
    "consider now the assumption ( [ linsys ] ) . by riemann - roch , this is equivalent to : @xmath331 this is solved by taking @xmath332 this is where the choice of @xmath2 comes in - we choose @xmath2 and @xmath311 such that @xmath185 is an integer ( and large enough ) .",
