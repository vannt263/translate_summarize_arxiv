    "the main goal of this paper is to study geometric properties of the @xmath30-dimensional systems and to partly resolve prediction 3 above in the case @xmath31 .",

    "the linear case ( case b ) in the two dimensional case ( @xmath35 ) is particularly relevant from the point of view of applications , since it is reasonable to assume that for diploid populations , the total fitness of any given individual is a linear combination of the fitnesses of each of her alleles .",
    "( in this interpretation we thus view each coordinate as the fitness of the allele on the corresponding chromosome , and so the ` spatial ' position has nothing to do with the geographical position of that individual in space .",

    "we are also able to obtain a lower bound for the correct genealogical time for the one - dimensional process up to some mild conditions on the initial position of the particles .",

    "thus theorem [ t : mrca ] applies _ verbatim _ to such systems , which partly confirms a prediction of @xcite ( see item ( iii ) at the start of the introduction ) .",

    "theorem [ t : sausage ] gives information about the dimensions ( width and length ) of the limiting shape in case b. however , an inspection of the simulations suggests that particles are far from uniformly distributed within that shape . in the direction @xmath62",
    ", we expect the density of particles to be close to @xmath137 for the same reasons as above . in the transverse direction @xmath69",

    "it is an interesting question to identify the density of particles at equilibrium .      as alluded to in earlier parts of this introduction , our brunet  derrida system in more than one dimension can be thought of as a model for the effect of selection on multiple linked loci . in this interpretation , we track the fitness of not one but @xmath30 loci in a population of size @xmath1 .",
    "each particle corresponds to one - half of an individual s genetic material , and each of the @xmath30 coordinates of that particle represents the fitness at the corresponding locus .",
    "her total fitness will then be a function of these @xmath30 values , typically just the sum . in this interpretation",
    ", we are assuming that the total fitness of each particle evolves like independent brownian motions and branch independently of one another , which is a simplification because in reality , two particles  making up one individual  will branch simultaneously .",
    "for the same reasons , whereas in our model we only remove one particle at a time , it would be make more sense to remove two particles at once ( also making up an individual ) .",

    "it has been a longstanding problem in evolutionary biology to explain the ubiquitous nature of diploid populations over haploid populations . indeed , in diploid populations the chance of a particular gene being transmitted to an offspring is only 50% , whereas it is 100% in haploid populations !",
    "this would suggest that haploid populations are far more advantageous from the point of view of a particular gene .",
    "this paradox was in fact raised soon after the introduction of darwin s theory of natural selection and evolution .    as early as 1889",
    ", weismann @xcite advocated that sex functions to provide variation for natural selection to act upon .",
    "however it is fair to say that no real consensus was achieved in the population genetics community , especially after influential arguments by williams @xcite raised doubts on weismann s theory .",
    "the controversy reached the point where understanding the advantage of sexual reproduction became the  queen of problems in evolutionary biology \" @xcite .",
    "we refer to burt @xcite for an excellent and highly readable survey of this question .    in his study of the problem , burt @xcite observed that his models led to a negative correlation between the fitness on the two chromosomes , which is equivalent to a cloud of particles being spread out in the direction orthogonal to the fitness gradient ( see fig .",
    "1d of @xcite ) .",
    "he then reasoned that a small amount of recombination would lead to a reduction in this correlation and greater variance in the overall fitness , ultimately leading to a fitter population , as can be seen on figure [ f : recomb ] . thus theorem [ t : sausage ]",
