    "while counter - intuitive , the sub - heisenberg uncertainties given by eqs .  ( [ p11])([small_uncertainty ] ) do not violate any basic law of quantum mechanics .",
    "the reason is that we only estimate the position and momentum of the mirror _ some time in the past _ as if they were classical random processes with wigner - distribution statistics , but it is impossible to verify our estimates by comparing them against the mirror in the past , which has since been irreversibly perturbed by the unknown radiation pressure noise . in classical estimation ,",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath205 are classical random processes unknown to the observer but can in principle be perfectly measured or simply decided at will by another party , so it is possible to compare one s delayed estimates against the perfect versions and verify the smoothing errors . in the quantum regime , however , one can not measure the mirror in the past more accurately without disturbing it further , and the only way for us to obtain perfect information about the mirror position or momentum is to perform a strong projective measurement . unlike the kalman - bucy estimates , which predict the mirror position and momentum at present and can be verified by performing a projective measurement at present , it is obviously impossible to go back to the past and perform a strong projective measurement on the mirror to verify our delayed estimates without changing our model of the problem .",
    "it is also impossible to perfectly reverse the dynamics of the mirror in time and recreate the past quantum state without introducing additional noise , because quantum - limited optical phase measurements prevent us from obtaining any information about the optical power fluctuations , and the dynamics of the mirror subject to the unknown radiation pressure noise is irreversible .",
    "thus , even though classical estimation theory indicates that we can achieve more accurate estimates than the heisenberg uncertainty principle would allow , quantum mechanics seem to forbid one from experimentally verifying the violation . in this sense",
    "the apparent paradox is analogous to the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox @xcite and may yet have implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics . in practice",
    ", while one may argue from a frequentist point of view that delayed estimation of quantum processes is meaningless if it can not be verified , smoothing should still be able to improve the estimation of a classical random process in a quantum system , such as a classical force acting on a quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have used classical estimation theory to design homodyne phase - locked loop for quantum optical phase estimation , and shown that the estimation performance can be improved when delay is permitted and smoothing is applied .",
    "we have focused on coherent states , as it can be regarded as a classical field with additive phase - insensitive noise upon homodyne detection , and classical estimation techniques can be applied directly . the optimal adaptive homodyne measurement scheme for nonclassical states remains an open problem . along this direction berry and wiseman",
    "have recently suggested the use of bayesian estimation for narrowband squeezed states when the mean phase is a wiener process @xcite .",
    "generalization of their scheme to more general random processes is challenging but may be facilitated by classical nonlinear estimation techniques @xcite .",
    "when we apply the same classical techniques to the quantum - limited estimation of harmonic - oscillator position and momentum , we find that the two conjugate variables can be simultaneously estimated with inferred accuracies beyond the heisenberg uncertainty relation , if smoothing is performed .",
    "although quantum mechanics seems to forbid one from verifying the delayed estimates by destroying the evidence , this result remains counter - intuitive and may have implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics . in the general context of quantum trajectory theory @xcite , quantum smoothing deserves further investigation and should be useful for quantum sensing and communication applications @xcite .",
