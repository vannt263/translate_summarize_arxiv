    "recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the mathematical theory of large deviations , putting the theory at the fore of research in statistical physics . roughly speaking , large deviation theory is concerned with probabilities of sums of random variables which are far away from their expected ( mean ) value @xcite . in physics , these sums are typically extensive variables such as energy and mass @xcite , but can also be time - integrated observables such as currents @xcite . in most cases with short - range correlations between the random variables , the probability density that a sum of random variables @xmath2 takes a large value @xmath3 ( meaning that @xmath4 ) is found to decay exponentially @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the rate function characterising the exponential decay . when ( [ large - deviation - principle ] ) holds , @xmath7 is said to satisfy the _",
    "large deviation principle_.    while exceptions to this principle are rare ( at least for short - range correlated variables ) , their occurrence indicates a strikingly different behaviour .",
    "a prominent example is that of condensation phenomenon , where one of the random variables takes a macroscopic fraction of the sum @xcite .",
    "the simplest realisation is found in sums of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables whose common probability density @xmath8 is heavy - tailed , i.e. has tails that decay slower than exponential @xcite . in that case",
    "the probability density @xmath7 is dominated by a single contribution to the sum @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 $ ] is the mean with respect to @xmath8 and the factor @xmath11 indicates that any of the random variables can take the role of the condensate .    in physics ,",
    "condensation phenomena have been extensively studied in mass - transport models such as the zero - range process ( zrp ) and several related models@xcite .",
    "these models comprise masses @xmath12 ( discrete or continuous ) that are exchanged locally between neighbouring sites , typically on a one - dimensional lattice . despite non - trivial ( and generally non - equilibrium ) dynamics , under certain conditions the steady state in a class of mass - trasport models ( such as in zrp ) takes a simple factorised form @xcite , @xmath13 \\delta\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^l m_j - m\\right)\\;. \\label{fss}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the single - site weight , the delta function ensures that the total mass @xmath15 is conserved and equal to @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the normalization constant ( partition function ) given by @xmath18\\ ,   \\delta\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^l m_j - m\\right)\\ ; , \\label{pf1}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the integral ( for continuous masses ) or the sum ( for discrete masses ) .",
    "the condensation take place provided @xmath14 is heavy - tailed and the density @xmath20 is greater than @xmath21 , which is given by @xcite @xmath22 the heavy - tailed condition required for condensation is that @xmath23 ( modulo any exponentially decreasing dependence on @xmath24 ) should decay to zero faster than @xmath25 but slower than exponentially @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath26 fulfils the criterion as does a stretched exponential distribution @xmath27    recently , we showed that iid random variables with a light - tailed distribution can also exhibit condensation if there is an additional constraint on their linear statistics , such as the variance @xmath28 @xcite . in that case @xmath14 does not need to be heavy - tailed , since it acquires an additional factor through the second constraint that has a weibull - like heavy tail @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we take a step further and study _ correlated _ random variables conditioned on two constraints . as a prototype model belonging to this class ,",
    "we study a discrete - time ( continuous - space ) reflected random walk on a line .",
    "a walker starts at the origin at time @xmath29 , and undergoes independent jumps at each instant .",
    "if a jump takes it to the negative site , its position is reset to the origin ( reflecting boundary condition ) ( see figure [ fig1 ] for a typical sample path ) . in this model ,",
    "the relevant random variables are the positions @xmath30 s of the walker at different times . even though , the increment ( jump ) at each instant are independent , the positions @xmath30 s at different times are strongly correlated .",
    "we are interested in paths of this process that realise fixed values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 defined by @xmath33 where @xmath31 is the area under the path and @xmath32 is the number of returns to the origin , which is also known as ( discrete ) local time .",
    "one of our main results is to show that these two constraints together can generate a single random walk excursion  a path between two successive returns to the origin  which takes a macroscopic fraction of the total area @xmath31 . in this context , this single excursion is the analogue of a condensate .",
    "we will discuss when and how this form of condensation occurs .",
    "this condensation phenomenon is seemingly different from the standard one studied for i.i.d .",
    "random variables in the literature @xcite , considering that the condensate spans more than one random variable @xmath30 .",
    "however , we show how to recast the process in terms of random walk excursions , i.e. , the paths between successive returns to the origin , which are mutually independent ( due to the markov nature of the process ) , thus connecting this condensation phenomenon to the standard one for iid random variables . even though our conclusion holds for generic short - range jump distribution , in this paper we will present explicit results for the double exponential ( or laplace ) jump distribution for which the transition line ( between fluid and condensed phases ) can be found exactly . indeed",
    ", this particular jump distribution has played an important role already in computing exactly the probability distribution of several interesting variables , such as the area under an excursion of a discrete - time random walk @xcite . in our case also , it turns out that this special choice of the jump distribution makes analytical calculations possible .",
    "finally , we establish a direct connection between the conditioned random walk paths discussed above and the mass - transfer models in which the steady state assumes a pair - factorised form @xcite given by @xmath34 where the pair function @xmath35 consists of the interaction part @xmath36 and the single - site potential @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{pair - function}\\ ] ] the most striking feature of the steady state ( [ pair - factorised - probability ] ) is that it exhibits spatially - extended ( or interaction - driven ) condensation for particle density @xmath39 above some critical density @xmath21 , given in ( [ rhoc ] ) .",
    "however , a precise understanding of this novel type of condensation within the theory of large deviations is still lacking .    to fill this gap , we show that the phenomenon of interaction - driven condensation is related to the standard condensation , albeit one that is driven by two constraints rather than one .",
    "we arrive at this result by mapping the problem to a random walk that stays non - negative and using recent results on the equivalence of nonequilibrium path ensembles @xcite .",
    "our results therefore unify these two seemingly disparate condensation phenomena and fortify the belief that other , more complex condensation phenomena may have a similar origin @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ conditioned - random - walk ]",
    "we study a discrete - time and continuous - space reflected random walk conditioned on the fixed total area @xmath31 and number of returns to the origin @xmath32 .",
    "after recasting the process in terms of successive random walk excursions , in section [ analysis - parition - function ] we show how fixing @xmath31 causes a single excursion to take a finite fraction of the total area , thus signalling a condensation transition . in section",
    "[ interaction - driven ] we establish a direct connection between the conditioned random walk discussed above and the mass - transfer models with pair - factorised steady states that exhibit interaction - driven condensation .",
    "finally we conclude in section [ conclusion ] with a summary and discussion .",
    "some details are relegated to the appendices .    .",
    "the path starts at @xmath40 at time @xmath29 and ends at @xmath41 at time @xmath42 ; it consists of three excursions denoted by numbers @xmath43 and @xmath44 that are represented by three different colours.,width=377 ]",
    "we consider a discrete - time , continuous space random walk on a line .",
    "the walker starts at the origin at time @xmath29 . in this model ,",
    "when the position of the walker becomes negative , its position is instantaneously reset to the origin .",
    "the process , which we refer to as the _ reflected random walk _",
    ", is described by the following recurrence equation @xmath45 where @xmath30 is position of the random walker at time step @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables with a common probability density @xmath49 .",
    "we note that the process ( [ reflected - random - walk ] ) is well known in queueing theory , where it is called the lindley process @xcite . here",
    "we are interested in paths @xmath50 that start from @xmath51 at @xmath29 and return to the same position @xmath52 at time @xmath53 . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "these are known as stochastic bridges . for a reflected random",
    "walk , stochastic bridges coincide with stochastic excursions , which are defined as bridges that stay non - negative .    for a given path @xmath54 , we are interested in the following two functionals of @xmath55 : the total area @xmath56 $ ] @xmath57=\\sum_{t=1}^{t}x_t,\\ ] ] and the number of returns to the origin @xmath58 $ ] , also known as local time , @xmath59=\\sum_{t=1}^{t}\\delta_{x_t,0}.\\ ] ] in addition , we are interested in all paths that achieve fixed values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where both @xmath62 and @xmath11 are proportional to the total duration @xmath53 of the walk , @xmath63 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are positive constants .",
    "generally we choose values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 which correspond to large deviations of the unconstrained walk .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to show that conditioning paths on their total area and local time , both set proportional to the total duration @xmath53 of the walk , leads to the emergence of a single large excursion , which we refer to as the condensate , that takes a macroscopic fraction of the fixed total area @xmath62 .",
    "this condensation phenomenon occurs when @xmath64 ( defined in ( [ a - n ] ) ) is larger than the critical @xmath66 ( for a fixed @xmath65 ) , which we calculate explicitly for the double exponential ( also known as the laplace ) jump distribution @xmath67 ( normalized to unity ) .",
    "we also show that conditioning on @xmath61 alone does not cause the transition  it is only when both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are fixed that the condensate emerges .",
    "we start by writing down the path probability @xmath68 $ ] of observing a path @xmath55 conditioned on the events @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which reads @xmath69=\\frac{1}{z_{n}(a , t)}\\prod_{t=1}^{t}w(x_t\\vert x_{t-1})\\delta(l_t - n)\\delta(a_t - a ) ,      \\label{path - probability}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the normalisation constant and the transition probability , respectively , @xmath72 @xmath73 we note that the variable @xmath30 in ( [ reflected - random - walk ] ) is neither a continuous nor a discrete random variable , but a mixture of both .",
    "such mixed random variables are described by a generalised transition probability ( [ transition - probability ] ) that involves the dirac delta function .",
    "the form in ( [ transition - probability ] ) takes into account the fact that if a jump at time @xmath74 takes the walker to the negative side , its position at @xmath30 is instantaneously reset to @xmath75 .    instead of writing the delta function @xmath76 in ( [ partition - function ] ) and integrating over all paths , we can take @xmath11 returns explicitly into account , as follows .",
    "let us denote with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , the time of the @xmath79-th return to the origin .",
    "then the path between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is a random walk excursion and we let @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote its duration and area , respectively , @xmath84 ( note that since @xmath85 , the duration and area of the first excursion are given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively ; see figure [ fig1 ] for more details . ) the partition function @xmath70 can then be written in an alternative form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the joint probability density for the duration @xmath82 and area @xmath83 of excursion @xmath79 .",
    "the expression ( [ partition - main ] ) for the partition function @xmath90 is central to our paper .",
    "the advantage of introducing new random variables @xmath83 and @xmath82 is that the pairs @xmath91 , for different @xmath78 are mutually independent ( except for the global constraints on their sums ) , in contrast to the positions @xmath30 , @xmath92 , which depend on @xmath93 .",
    "this formulation thus exploits explicitly the renewal nature of the process ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "here we compute the joint probability density @xmath94 for the discrete - time and continuous - space random walk with the double exponential jump probability density @xmath95 to the best of our knowledge , explicit calculations of @xmath94 have been made so far only for the simple ( bernoulli ) random walk ( discrete time and space ) by takcs @xcite and for the brownian motion ( continuous time and space ) by kearney and majumdar @xcite . in that context , our results present a novel calculation for the discrete - time and continuous - space random walk .",
    "to calculate @xmath94 , we need to study the probability of the following event .",
    "we consider a free random walker starting at the origin that makes successive jumps , stays positive till step @xmath96 and at time @xmath1 becomes negative for the first time .",
    "thus @xmath1 is the first - passage time and is a random variable .",
    "let @xmath97 denote the ` area ' contained under the walk up to this first - passage time .",
    "then @xmath94 denotes the joint probability density of the area @xmath0 till the first - passage time and the first - passage time @xmath1 itself .",
    "problems where one is interested in computing distributions of functionals of a random walk till its first - passage time are generally referred to _ first - passage functionals _ @xcite . to compute these distributions",
    ", it turns out to be advantageous to use a backward fokker - planck approach , suitably adapted @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we will consider the starting position of the random walker @xmath98 as a variable , calculate distributions of the functionals for a given @xmath99 , and eventually set @xmath100 to obtain our desired result .     at time @xmath29 and",
    "its position evolves via successive independent jumps .",
    "it crosses @xmath75 to the negative side for the first time at @xmath101 .",
    "the total area till the first - passage time @xmath101 is defined as @xmath102.,width=377 ]    let @xmath103 denote the joint probability density of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , starting at @xmath51 , where , as before , @xmath104 . to find @xmath103 we have to integrate over all positions @xmath105 , @xmath106 , where @xmath30 is strictly positive at @xmath107 and negative or zero at @xmath108 ( see figure [ fig2 ] for a schematic representation ) : @xmath109 this integral equation has a simple interpretation : in the first step the walker jumps from the initial position @xmath110 to a new point at @xmath111 ( the probability of this event is simply @xmath112 ) .",
    "following this first step the process renews itself with @xmath113 being the new starting position .",
    "for the subsequent evolution starting at @xmath113 , the area should be @xmath114 and the first - passage time should be @xmath96 , explaining the factor @xmath115 on the rhs . finally , one needs to integrate over all possible @xmath116 . a separate case to consider is for @xmath117 for which @xmath103 is given by @xmath118 this happens if at the first step the walker jumps to the negative side .",
    "note that the recursion equations ( [ pgt1 ] ) and ( [ fpt1 ] ) hold for arbitrary jump distribution @xmath119 .    to make further progress",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ znt.1 ] ) is similar to the standard form of the partition function in ( [ pf1 ] ) with a single site weight @xmath154 .",
    "hence , from the general criterion for condensation discussed in section [ intro ] , we expect condensation to happen if @xmath155 decays for large @xmath1 slower than exponential ( for example , algebraically with an exponent more than @xmath156 ) .",
