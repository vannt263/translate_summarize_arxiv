    "in the last few years , a small population of sources emitting short - duration ( `` fast '' ) transient radio bursts has been found .",
    "the bursts are bright , last no more than a few milliseconds , are broadband and show the characteristic signature of dispersion by a cold plasma medium .",
    "dispersion results in a frequency - dependent arrival time across the band , proportional to the integral of the electron column density along the line of sight , otherwise known as the dispersion measure ( dm ) . the prototypical fast radio burst ( frb ) was discovered by @xcite at a dm of 375  @xmath4  pc in archival pulsar survey data of the magellanic clouds @xcite . in a reanalysis of parkes",
    "multibeam pulsar survey data , @xcite identified an frb with a dm of 746  @xmath4  pc . recently , @xcite report the discovery of four further frbs at dms in the range 5501100  @xmath4  pc .",
    "given detailed models of the galactic electron column density distribution , these high dms place these sources far beyond the extent of the galaxy and signify the emergence of a population of cosmological transients with exciting applications as probes of new physics and the intergalactic ionized medium .",
    "dispersion is not the only frequency - dependent effect incurred from propagation through an ionized plasma .",
    "frbs will also be scattered due to inhomogeneities in this medium , with scattered rays arriving at the telescope later than those traveling on the direct line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting observed scattered pulse can be well approximated in most cases by a gaussian pulse convolved with an exponential tail , with temporal constant @xmath5 scaling with frequency @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "although it was often assumed that @xmath8 , as expected for kolmogorov turbulence @xcite , @xcite found a flatter dependence where @xmath9 .",
    "later , from a larger sample of pulsars , @xcite found that @xmath10 and presented an empirical relation between @xmath5 and dm ( see  2 ) .",
    "these two quantities correlate well for the galactic population of pulsars , albeit with a dispersion of up to an order of magnitude on either side of the dm-@xmath5 curve .    using the results of surveys at 1400  mhz , we investigate event rate predictions for surveys at 150  mhz and 350  mhz .",
    "the 150  mhz band is pertinent given the advent of lofar @xcite as a wide - field of view low - frequency transient monitor .",
    "the 350  mhz band is covered by all - sky pulsar surveys being carried out at the green bank telescope @xcite and at arecibo @xcite . in ",
    "2 we demonstrate that the scattering in low - frequency surveys is less severe if frbs are at cosmological distances . in ",
    "3 we describe a simple model that provides testable event rate predictions for ongoing and future surveys .",
    "we discuss these results in  4 and present our conclusions in  5 .",
    "pc have scattering timescale upper limits of 1  ms.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    @xcite discussed the possibility of detecting frbs with low - frequency telescopes .",
    "the burst they detected showed evolution of pulse width with frequency , but they could not determine whether this was intrinsic or due to scattering .",
    "the @xmath11ms scattering expected at a dm of 375  @xmath4  pc at 1  ghz scales to a scattering timescale of order 1  s at 150  mhz , leading to their suggestion that the pulse would be undetectable at those frequencies .",
    "however , of the 6 frbs known so far , only one ( frb  110220 ) has had a measurable scattering timescale at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the observation that the frbs all lie significantly below the bulk of pulsars in the bhat et al .",
    "( 2004 ) dm-@xmath5 curve , suggests that , for a particular dm , there is less scattering for an extragalactic source than would be expected from interpreting the curve .    for frbs of extragalactic origin , the total scattering is made up of two contributions : interstellar scattering in the host galaxy and our own galaxy , and intergalactic scattering caused by the intervening intergalactic medium . despite the fact that most of the scattering material is found in the interstellar medium of the host or our galaxy , geometrical considerations ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) suggest that contributions to scattering from media near the source or near the observer are expected to be small .",
    "to estimate the impact of this , we rewrite equation ( 2 ) from @xcite in terms of the scattering induced by a screen at a fractional distance @xmath12 along the line of sight . as @xmath13 , the screen is close the observer , and as @xmath14 , the screen is close to the source . in this case",
    "the scattering time @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the maximum scattering induced for a screen placed midway along the line of sight ( @xmath17 ) . for scattering originating from a host galaxy at cosmological distances , @xmath18 is the size of the host galaxy divided by the distance to the source , i.e.  @xmath19 for a galaxy with the extent of the milky way at the distance inferred for the @xcite frb .",
    "therefore , the scattering effects of our own galaxy or the host galaxy can be essentially neglected for bursts at cosmological distances .",
    "the same geometric considerations suggest that the most efficient scattering along the line of sight towards frbs of extragalactic origin will occur in the medium near the midway point .",
    "measurements of the scattering measure ( sm ) along extragalactic lines of sight ( for details , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] by @xcite suggest values that are typically @xmath20 sm of galactic lines of sight , despite the large distances to extragalactic sources . given that @xmath21 and the distance @xcite , similar pulse broadening times could be observed for a galactic source at 5 kpc as for an extragalactic source at @xmath22300 mpc . in fig .",
    "[ fg : bhat ] , we show our adaptation of the dm-@xmath5 curve and plot the frb scattering timescales scaled to an observing frequency of 1  ghz . here",
    "we see that the upper limit on the scattering timescale for the frb of @xcite lies well below the expected trend for galactic pulsars , as does the timescale for the one event of four for which @xcite were able to measure @xmath5 .",
    "taking the 1-ms of scattering at 1.4  ghz of this event , which scales to 3.66  ms at 1  ghz , and comparing it to the predicted value of @xmath23  ms , suggests that rescaling the @xcite equation : @xmath24 so that the leading term is 9.5 rather than 6.5 provides an estimate of the expected scattering for extragalactic sources . in this expression",
    ", dm takes its usual units of @xmath4  pc and the frequency , @xmath12 , is in ghz . note that , given that only one measurement of the scattering timescale has been made so far , it is likely that this is an upper limit to the average amount of scattering as a function of dm .    in summary , based on the theoretical expectations of low scattering towards frbs of extragalactic origin and the recent 1.4  ghz observations in which little or no scattering is observed , frb scattering at frequencies below 1  ghz is also expected to be substantially less than would be the case if they were of galactic origin .",
    "this raises the possibility that they can be detectable in surveys at lower frequencies .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we discuss the implications of this conclusion and make predictions using a population model .",
    "the events reported by @xcite , along with those previously @xcite imply a substantial population of transients detectable by ongoing and planned radio surveys .",
    "while an investigation of event rates was recently carried out by @xcite , the analysis assumed euclidean geometry , ignoring cosmological effects .",
    "the results of @xcite , where significant redshifts ( @xmath25 ) are implied by the high dispersion measures , imply that propagation effects in an expanding universe must be taken into account . to begin to characterize this population and make testable predictions , we consider the simplest possible cosmological model in which frbs are standard candles with constant number density per unit comoving volume . the former assumption is justified for source models in which the energetics do not vary substantially .",
    "along with the latter assumption , as we demonstrate below , this model is eminently testable by ongoing and future fast - sampling radio surveys .",
    "considering the sources as standard candles implies that , for a given survey at some frequency @xmath6 , there is a unique correspondence between the observed flux density and redshift probed .",
    "to simplify matters , we consider a model in which the pulses have a top - hat shape with some finite width . as we show below , under these assumptions , the flux density  redshift relationship is independent of pulse width . to derive this relationship , we use standard results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and adopt a flat universe where , for a source at redshift @xmath26 , the comoving distance @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the speed of light , @xmath29 is the hubble constant and the dimensionless parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the total energy densities of matter and dark energy respectively . following the latest results from _",
    "@xcite we adopt a flat universe in which @xmath32  km  s@xmath33  mpc@xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . to obtain the peak flux density @xmath36 averaged over a certain bandwidth at some frequency @xmath6 , we model the energy released per unit frequency interval in the rest frame , @xmath37 , using the power - law relationship @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant , @xmath40 is the rest - frame frequency and @xmath41 is a spectral index . assuming a top - hat pulse of width w in the rest frame of the source , from conservation of energy , for an observation over some frequency band between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we may write @xmath44 where the luminosity distance @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth noting here that the @xmath46 term on the left - hand side of this expression reflects the fact that the pulse has been obtained by dedispersion over this finite observing band .",
    "the measured quantity , @xmath36 is therefore @xmath47 where @xmath48 represents the flux density per narrow frequency channel within the band .",
    "on the right hand side of equation [ eq : speak0 ] , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the lower and upper extent of the observing band in the rest frame of the source . using these identities , and integrating equation [ eq : speak0 ] for the case where @xmath51 , we find @xmath52 to write equation [ eq : speak1 ] in terms of a luminosity model , we note that the bolometric luminosity @xmath53 where the model parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 are respectively the lowest and highest frequencies over which the source emits . combining these last two equations to eliminate @xmath56 $ ]",

    ". due to the normalization the exact choice of @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not significantly affect the rate calculations given below .",
    "the results of this procedure , at 1400  mhz , 350  mhz and 150  mhz , with respective bandwidths of 350  mhz , 100  mhz and 50  mhz are shown in fig .",

    "redshift relationship is therefore @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the thornton et al .",

    "the results of this calculation are shown as a function of @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fg : candles ] . also shown are the predicted rates as a function of threshold flux density and survey frequency .",
    "the model presented in the previous section and shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : candles ] makes a number of testable predictions for ongoing and planned radio surveys . within the rate uncertainties found by @xcite , assuming sensitivity out to some @xmath26 , fitting a cubic to the centre panel of fig .",
    "[ fg : candles ] provides the following good approximation to the expected event rate out to @xmath70 : @xmath71    an important constraint for our model is that it should be consistent with ongoing surveys at 1.4  ghz where assumptions about the source spectral index are not required .",
    "currently , the most sensitive fast transient search at 1.4  ghz is the ongoing pulsar arecibo l - band feed array ( palfa ) survey @xcite which has so far found no frbs . through detailed considerations ,",
    "@xcite quantify the effects of the greater depth probed by the palfa survey and its smaller field of view .",
    "a comparison of the solid curve shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fg : candles ] of this paper and fig .  8 from @xcite shows that our model is currently not excluded by the lack of detections in the palfa survey .",
    "our model is also consistent with the `` fly s eye '' survey carried out with the allen telescope array ( ata ) by @xcite which was sensitive to pulses with peak fluxes @xmath72  jy ( assuming a 3  ms pulse width ) .",
    "our predicted rate of a few times @xmath73  frbs  hr@xmath33  deg@xmath74 is below the ata upper limit of @xmath75  frbs  hr@xmath33  deg@xmath74 .",
    "further bursts are expected in the other 1.4  ghz multibeam surveys . in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey @xcite ,",
    "where only one frb candidate has so far been found @xcite , a simple scaling of the thornton et al .",

    "event , the survey coverage along the galactic plane may imply that searches covering higher dm ranges are necessary .",
    "a search of archival data from the @xcite and @xcite intermediate and high latitude surveys by @xcite revealed a number of rotating radio transients , but no new frbs .",
    "however , the dm range covered in this effort ( 0600  @xmath4  pc ) was likely not sufficient to sample a significant volume , based on the results presented here .",
    "we suggest that reanalyses of these data sets may result in further frb discoveries .",
    "we note also that the substantial amount of time spent and field of view covered by the htru - north survey at effelsberg @xcite mean around 20 frbs are expected .    at 350  mhz ,",
    "a significant fraction of the transient sky is currently being covered by pulsar searches with the gbt .",
    "the drift - scan survey carried out during summer 2007 @xcite , acquired a total of 1491 hours of observations and has so far discovered 35 pulsars .",
    "based on the survey parameters given by @xcite , we estimate the instantaneous field of view to be about 0.3  deg@xmath3 and the 10@xmath76 sensitivity for pulses of width 3  ms to be about 35  mjy . as can be inferred from fig .",

    "we infer a rate of about @xmath78 bursts per 0.3  deg@xmath3 per hour , or of order one frb in the entire survey .",

    ", in preparation ) .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of these data , and ongoing arecibo 327  mhz surveys @xcite should provide interesting constraints on the frb population . if the same dm limit can be reached by 150  mhz surveys with large fields of view , the expected detection rate above 30  jy with dms below 500  @xmath4  pc is @xmath79 event per day per 30 square degrees .",
    "we have used the results of @xcite to calibrate a cosmological model which predicts the rate of frbs as a function of redshift .",
    "our assumption of uniform source density with comoving volume implies a significant population of bursts detectable at moderate to low redshifts by low - frequency ( @xmath80  ghz ) surveys .",
    "moreover , our assumption that the bursts are standard candles implies that such events should be bright ( 10s of jy or more ) and would be readily detectable by instruments with modest collecting areas . both of these assumptions can be tested by ongoing and future surveys .",
    "an important conclusion from this work is that low - frequency surveys should sample as large a dm range as possible , and search for pulses over a wide range of widths .",
    "an additional simplification we have made is that the source spectra follow a power law with slope of 1.4 .",
    "the event rates predicted here will differ significantly if the spectrum deviates from this form .",
    "many of the current ongoing surveys and other large - scale surveys expected over the next few years with lofar  @xcite , the mwa @xcite and the australian square kilometre array pathfinder @xcite , and other facilities , will undoubtedly find more frbs and test the predictions presented here .",
