    "the irreversibility of quantum measurement is an axiomatic property of textbook quantum mechanics.@xcite in his famous article _ law without law _ , john wheeler expresses the idea with poetic flare : `` we are dealing with [ a quantum ] event that makes itself known by an irreversible act of amplification , by an indelible record , an act of registration.''@xcite however , it has been gradually recognized that the textbook treatment of an instantaneous wavefunction collapse is really a very special case of what is in general a dynamical process - continuous quantum measurement .",
    "continuous measurements do not project the system immediately into an eigenstate of the observable , but describe a process whereby the collapse happens over a period of time",
    ". @xcite the fact that continuous measurement is a dynamical process with projective measurement as a special case , leads us to ask whether the irreversibility of quantum measurement is also a special case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to review and expand on recent developments in this area of research , showing that it is possible to undo a quantum measurement , thereby uncollapsing the wavefunction , and to describe this physics in detail for both the abstract and concrete physical realizations .",
    "this paper follows our earlier work on the subject,@xcite as well as other papers investigating similar questions.@xcite wavefunction uncollapse teaches us several things about the fundamentals of quantum mechanics .",
    "first , there is a notion that wavefunction represents many possibilities , but that reality is created by measurement .",
    "the fact that the effects of measurement can be undone suggests that this idea is flawed , or at least too simplistic .",
    "if you create reality with quantum measurements , does undoing them erase the reality you created ?",
    "secondly , there is a wide - spread belief that quantum measurement is nothing more than a decoherence process .",
    "this suggests that the superposition never really collapses ; it only appears to collapse .",
    "what actually happens , according to this idea , is that all the information about the system disperses into the environment : when a quantum system interacts with a classical measuring device , it becomes irreversibly entangled with all the particles that make up the measuring device and its surroundings .",
    "the uncollapse of the wavefunction demonstrates that decoherence theory can not be the whole story , because a true decoherence process is irreversible.@xcite the perspective we take in this paper further advances the ` quantum bayesian ' point of view , where the quantum state is nothing more than a reflection of our information about the system .",
    "when we receive more information about the system , the state changes or collapses not because of any mysterious forces , but simply as a result of bayesian updating .",
    "our work is indirectly related to the ` quantum eraser ' of scully and drhl.@xcite there , the which - path information of a particle is encoded in the quantum state of an atom , resulting in a destruction of interference fringe visibility . on the other hand ,",
    "if the which - path information of the particle is erased , the interference fringes are restored .",
    "both the scully proposal and our proposal erase information .",
    "however , there is an important difference . in order for the uncollapsing procedure to work",
    ", we have to erase the information that was already extracted classically . in the ` quantum eraser ' ,",
    "only potentially extractable information is erased .    while the first part of this paper deals with the abstract idea of uncollapse , and formalizes its properties in terms of generalized quantum measurements , a great deal of the paper deals with actual measurement processes in specific physical contexts .",
    "this brings to mind the saying of asher peres : `` quantum phenomena do not occur in a hilbert space .",
    "they occur in a laboratory''.@xcite following peres dictum , we discuss measurement processes in a variety of solid state systems , where there has been remarkable experimental progress in recent years .",
    "quantum coherence has been demonstrated to occur in a controllable fashion in systems such as semiconductor quantum dots and superconducting josephson junctions .",
    "we will discuss the physics of measurement in these systems , as well as concrete strategies for uncollapsing the wavefunction .",
    "it should be stressed that two of these proposals ( a superconducting phase qubit and optical polarization qubit ) have now been implemented in the laboratory , providing conclusive demonstration of wavefunction uncollapse.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe in detail what we mean by the undoing of a quantum measurement ( sec .",
    "iia ) , and give a general treatment of the physics , using the formalism of positive operator - valued measures ( povms ) .",
    "this is done both for pure states ( sec .",
    "iib ) and mixed states ( sec .",
    "iic ) . in sec .",
    "iid we discuss the interpretation of wavefunction uncollapse , and what it tells us about quantum information . sec .",
    "iii begins discussion of the physical implementation of this physics , with a treatment of the double quantum dot qubit , monitored by a quantum point contact .",
    "the measurement dynamics is discussed in [ charge - dynamics ] and we discuss the uncollapsing strategy and statistical predictions in sec .",
    "[ charge - uncollapse ] for the case of a qubit undergoing measurement dynamics only .",
    "the results are discussed in [ charge - discussion ] and compared with the abstract results . in sec .",
    "[ charge - statistics ] we discuss the statistical features of the time required to wait until the wavefunction is uncollapsed .",
    "we generalize to the case of the finite - hamiltonian qubit undergoing the uncollapse process in sec .",
    "[ charge - evolve ] , and derive results for the success probability in that case .",
    "we switch to a new physical system in sec .",
    "iv , the superconducting phase qubit . in sec .",
    "iva we discuss how the measurement process works for the phase qubit , and in sec .  ivb we discuss the uncollapsing strategy , corresponding success probability , and the recent experimental realization , which demonstrated the uncollapsing . in sec .",
    "v , we generalize to the case of many charge qubits , and discuss an explicit procedure to undo any generalized measurement .",
    "we discuss recent developments in the theory and experiments of measurement reversal in sec .",
    "vi and conclude in sec .  vii .",
    "our goal is to restore an initial quantum state disturbed by measurement .",
    "however , it is important to discuss what exactly we mean by that .",
    "for example , if we start with a _ known _ pure state @xmath0 and perform a textbook projective measurement , then it is trivial to restore the initial state : since we also know the post - measurement wavefunction @xmath1 , we just need to apply a unitary operation which transfers @xmath1 into @xmath0 .",
    "if we start with a known mixed state , then its restoration after a projective measurement is a little more involved;@xcite however such a procedure still can be easily analyzed using standard quantum mechanics and classical probability theory .    in this paper",
    "we consider a different , non - trivial situation : we assume that an arbitrary initial state is _ unknown to us _ , and we still want to restore it after the measurement disturbance .",
    "to make this idea more precise , we consider a contest between the uncollapse _ proponent _ plato , and an uncollapse _ skeptic _ socrates .",
    "socrates prepares a quantum system in any state he likes , but it is unknown to plato .",
    "socrates sends the state to plato , who makes some measurement on the system , verified by the _ arbiter _ aristotle .",
    "plato then tries to undo the measurement .",
    "if plato judges that the attempt succeeded , the system is returned to socrates , with the claim that it is in the original state .",
    "socrates is then allowed to try and find a contradiction in any way he likes , with the whole process monitored by aristotle .",
    "if a contradiction can be found , then he can claim to refute the uncollapse claim , but in the absence of contradiction , the uncollapse claim stands .",
    "if socrates would like to try again to find a contradiction , or if plato judges that his undoing attempt was unsuccessful ( and does not return a state ) , then socrates prepares a new ( still unknown to plato ) state , and the competition continues . if socrates can not find a contradiction after many rounds of the competition , then plato will win the contest , and will have successfully demonstrated the uncollapsing of the quantum state .",
    "a slightly different but equivalent situation is when we know the initial state , but our uncollapsing procedure must be independent of the initial state ( so we can pretend that it is unknown ) , and therefore the uncollapsing should restore _ any _ initial state in the same way .",
    "this formulation is most appropriate for a real experiment demonstrating the uncollapsing .",
    "finally , we may consider the more general case where the measured system is entangled with another system , and we wish to restore the initial state of the compound system without any access to its second part .",
    "the traditional statement of irreversibility of a quantum measurement can be traced to the fact that it may be described as a mathematical projection .",
    "projection is a many - to - one mapping in the hilbert space , and therefore the same post - measurement state generally corresponds to ( infinitely ) many initial states.@xcite it is therefore impossible to undo a projective measurement .    however , the situation is different for a general @xcite ( povm - type ) measurement , which typically corresponds to a one - to - one mapping @xmath2 in the hilbert space of wavefunctions ( in this paper we consider only `` ideal '' measurements which do not introduce extra decoherence ) . in this case",
    "the post - measurement wavefunction @xmath1 can still be associated with the unique initial state @xmath0 , and a well - defined inverse mapping exists mathematically .",
    "this makes the uncollapsing possible in principle .",
    "since the inverse mapping is typically non - unitary , it can not be realized as an evolution with a suitable hamiltonian .",
    "however , it can be realized using another povm - type measurement with a specific ( `` lucky '' ) result .",
    "let us first consider a pure initial state @xmath0 , and postpone a generalization to mixed states until sec .",
    "iic . in the formalism of a general ( ideal )",
    "quantum measurement @xcite which transfers pure states into pure states , the measurement with result @xmath3 is associated with the linear kraus operator @xmath4 , so that the probability of result @xmath3 is p_m(|_in ) = || m_m |_in ||^2 , [ prob - wf ] where @xmath5 denotes the norm of the state , and the ( conditioned ) state after measurement is |_m = , [ state - wf ] where the denominator makes @xmath1 properly normalized .",
    "( very often people prefer to omit this denominator and work with non - normalized states ; this makes the mapping linear . ) the operators @xmath6 ( called povm elements @xcite ) are hermitian and positive semidefinite by construction ; these operators must obey the completeness relation @xmath7 , which ensures that the total probability of all measurement results is unity .",
    "a measurement operator @xmath4 can always be written as m_m = u_m , [ mop ] where @xmath8 is a unitary operator ( an important special case is when @xmath9 ; this corresponds to the `` quantum bayes theorem '' @xcite ) .",
    "now let us discuss wavefunction uncollapse in this general and abstract context .",
    "the state disturbance rule ( [ state - wf ] ) is typically a nonunitary one - to - one map in the hilbert space . to undo the measurement with known result @xmath3",
    ", we have to realize a physical process corresponding to the nonunitary inverse operator @xmath10 , multiplied by an arbitrary constant ( which is not important because of the normalization ) .",
    "this can be accomplished with another measurement , possibly together with unitary operations .",
    "as shown below , we can realize measurement undoing if the second measurement realizes a krauss operator of the form l = c",
    "u_l e_m^-1/2 v_l , [ l ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are any unitary operators , and @xmath13 is an unspecified constant that will be discussed later .",
    "( the operator @xmath14 also has a decomposition of the form @xmath15 , but with a different povm element @xmath16 . )",
    "the uncollapse then consists of three steps : first , the unitary operator @xmath17 is applied to reverse the unitary part of @xmath4 and prepare for the second measurement .",
    "next the measurement operator @xmath14 is applied .",
    "finally the unitary operator @xmath18 is applied to reverse the remaining unitary part of @xmath14 .",
    "we can now see the effect of the uncollapsing operation on the state @xmath1 by applying eq .",
    "( [ state - wf ] ) and the unitaries to find |_f= = |_in , thus restoring the original state , because @xmath19 , which is removed by the normalization .",
    "( the phase of @xmath13 is not important , since it affects only the overall phase of the wavefunction . )",
    "however , in order for the operator @xmath14 to be physically realizable , the operator @xmath20 must belong to another complete set of povm elements , and therefore all its eigenvalues must not exceed unity ( otherwise some states will be assigned probabilities that are above unity ; notice that the eigenvalues are non - negative automatically ) . since @xmath21 , its eigenvalues are directly related to the eigenvalues @xmath22 of the operator @xmath23 . expressing @xmath24 , where the eigenvectors @xmath25 form an orthonormal basis , the eigenvectors of @xmath20 are obviously @xmath26 , and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath27 .",
    "since all these eigenvalues must not exceed 1 , we find the following inequality on @xmath28 , |c|^2 _",
    "i p^(m)_i = p_m , [ bound - c ] where @xmath29 is the probability of the result @xmath3 , minimized over all possible states @xmath30 in the hilbert space .",
    "the equality of @xmath29 to @xmath31 follows from eq.([prob - wf ] ) .",
    "there is no guarantee that the uncollapse can be accomplished deterministically , since we rely on a measurement with a specific result , corresponding to the operator @xmath14 .",
    "we can calculate the uncollapse success probability @xmath32 from eq .",
    "( [ prob - wf ] ) , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , p_s = || lv_l^u_m^|_m||^2 = || ||^2 = .",
    "[ p_s-1 ] now using the bound ( [ bound - c ] ) for @xmath28 , we find the bound for the success probability of uncollapsing after the first measurement with result @xmath3 : p_s , [ p_s - wf]where the denominator is the probability of the result @xmath3 for a given initial state , while the numerator is this probability minimized over all possible initial states .",
    "the bound ( [ p_s - wf ] ) is one of the most important results ( notice a similar result in ref .",
    "[ ] ) and deserves a discussion .",
    "first , this bound is exact in the sense that it is achievable by the optimal uncollapsing procedure .",
    "this is because the uncollapsing operator with @xmath35 is still a physically allowed operator .",
    "as we will see later , the upper bound ( [ p_s - wf ] ) is achievable in real experimental setups",
    ". however , non - optimal uncollapsing procedures , especially involving a sequence of measurements , can lead to smaller success probabilities ( an example of non - optimal uncollapsing has been discussed in ref . [ ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the procedures with an arbitrary sequence of measurements and unitary operations is similar to the above : the corresponding measurement and unitary operators should simply be multiplied .",
    "notice that the success probability ( [ p_s-1 ] ) and the inequality ( @xmath36 ) depends on the initial state , which is unknown to the person performing the uncollapsing ( plato , see description in the previous subsection ) .",
    "therefore , the success probability @xmath32 can be calculated by the man who knows what the initial state is ( socrates ) , while plato can only estimate @xmath32 ; for example , he can calculate the worst - case scenario ( the minimum of @xmath32 over the accessible hilbert space ) or can calculate the average of @xmath32 over all possible initial states ( this procedure will be discussed in the next subsection ) .",
    "recalling the fact that it is not possible to undo a fully collapsed state due to the nature of projective measurement , the uncollapsing probability @xmath32 should decrease with increasing strength of the first measurement .",
    "qualitatively , a stronger measurement is one that tends to a projection , as the uncertainty in the measurement decreases .",
    "mathematically , this means that some eigenvalues of @xmath23 become closer to 0 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath29 becomes smaller [ see eq .",
    "( [ bound - c ] ) ] , therefore lowering the upper bound for @xmath32 . for a projective measurement @xmath37 , thus making the state uncollapse impossible .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the case when the initial state @xmath0 is known to belong to a certain subspace of the hilbert space , and we therefore wish to restore states only in this subspace . in this case , the calculation of @xmath29 should be limited to this subspace , which may increase the bound ( [ p_s - wf ] ) for the success probability @xmath32 .",
    "a trivial example of such a situation is when the initial state @xmath0 is known to plato .",
    "here it is not necessary to minimize @xmath38 over all possible initial states in eq .",
    "( [ p_s - wf ] ) , because the set of possible states consists of only one ( known ) state , thus allowing uncollapsing with 100% probability .",
    "this is exactly the case discussed at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ prdis ] .",
    "so far we have dealt only with pure states ; however , it is very simple to generalize the uncollapsing formalism to include density matrices . in this case",
    "the initial density matrix @xmath39 is transformed by the first measurement into the state @xcite _ m= , [ state - dm]where the probability @xmath38 of the measurement result @xmath3 is p_m(_in ) = ( m_m^m_m _ in ) .",
    "[ prob - dm]using the uncollapsing procedure previously discussed and using the same measurement operator @xmath14 given by eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , we find that the uncollapsed state _ f = = _ in [ rho - f]coincides with the initial state . the uncollapsing success probability @xmath32 is equal to the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ rho - f ] ) , and satisfies the relation p_s=|c|^2/p_m ( _ in ) [ p_s - dm ] [ as in eq .",
    "( [ p_s-1 ] ) ] . the constant @xmath28",
    "is still limited by the inequality ( [ bound - c ] ) , and therefore the probability of success has the upper bound p_s , [ gen - result ] which is the same as the bound ( [ p_s - wf ] ) , except for the new notation in the denominator , which reminds us of the possibly mixed initial state .",
    "the minimization of @xmath38 in the numerator should now be performed over the space of all possible initial mixed states ; however , the result obviously coincides with the minimization over the pure states only .",
    "similar to the case discussed in sec .",
    "[ formalism - wf ] , the inequality ( [ gen - result ] ) is the exact bound ; it is achieved by the optimal uncollapsing procedure , which maximizes @xmath40 .",
    "if the initial state is pure , then the formalism of this subsection is trivially equivalent to the formalism of sec.[formalism - wf ] .",
    "it becomes more general in the case when the `` actual '' initial state is mixed ; for example , this happens when the initial state has been in contact with an unmonitored environment or socrates prepares a state by a blind random choice from a set of pure states .",
    "a more interesting case for the result ( [ gen - result ] ) is when the measured system is entangled with another system , which does not evolve by itself .",
    "then the formalism can be applied to the compound system ; however , the measurement probability @xmath38 depends only on the reduced initial density matrix , traced over the entangled second part .",
    "therefore , in the entangled bipartite case the uncollapsing procedure restores the state of the whole system , while the success probability @xmath32 is given by eq .",
    "( [ gen - result ] ) with @xmath39 being the reduced density matrix .",
    "another advantage of eq .",
    "( [ gen - result ] ) in comparison with eq .",
    "( [ p_s - wf ] ) is the following . in the derivation of both results",
    "the initial state is the `` actual '' initial state , which is known to socrates , but typically unknown to plato .",
    "however , as we will prove below , eq .",
    "( [ gen - result ] ) can still be used by plato in a somewhat different sense : with @xmath39 being understood as an _ averaged _ density matrix representing a distribution of possible initial states . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ gen - result ] ) gives the uncollapsing probability averaged over this distribution .",
    "for example , if plato knew that socrates strategy is to prepare one of 2 possible ( nonorthogonal ) states @xmath41 , with probabilities @xmath42 and @xmath43 , then he could find the average undoing probability in two ways .",
    "the first method is that he could simply average the undoing probabilities of the two states ( also taking into account the information acquired in the first measurement , see below ) .",
    "alternatively , he could recall that the random state preparation described above is equivalent to considering the initial density matrix @xmath44 ) to this density matrix . in this way , in the absence of any information , plato could estimate his typical success rate by calculating ( [ gen - result ] ) for a fully mixed state , invoking the principle of indifference.@xcite    in the general case the above statement , that both ways of computing the averaged undoing probability are equivalent , can be proven both logically and explicitly . for the logical proof",
    "we notice that plato s judgment of successful undoing does not depend on whether or not socrates knows the randomly picked state ; therefore , the average probability of the cases judged to be successful should be the same in both situations ( whether or not socrates knows what the state is ) .",
    "now let us also prove this statement explicitly , thus checking that our formalism is self - consistent .",
    "suppose the initial state is prepared by socrates by choosing randomly from a set of initial states @xmath45 with probabilities @xmath46 ( the most natural case is when initial states are pure , @xmath47 ; however , this is not necessary ) .",
    "then the bound for the average probability of uncollapsing success @xmath48 is the average of the bounds ( [ gen - result ] ) : p_s^(av ) _ k p_k .",
    "[ p - s - av]notice , however , that @xmath49 is the posterior probability distribution given the result @xmath3 , which is different from @xmath50",
    ". we may now invoke the classical bayes rule @xcite ( k|m ) = to relate the posterior @xmath51 to the prior @xmath46 and the conditional probability @xmath52 to have result @xmath3 given state @xmath53 , so that _k = .",
    "[ p]substituting eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ p - s - av ] ) and using @xmath54 in the numerator , we obtain p_s^(av ) = , where @xmath55 is the averaged initial state .",
    "this ends the proof that eq.([gen - result ] ) can be used for an unknown initial state , with @xmath39 being understood as the average of all possible initial states .",
    "we defined the success probability @xmath32 as a probability to uncollapse the post - measurement state @xmath56 .",
    "we now wish to start counting the overall success probability @xmath57 from the time before the first measurement , so that @xmath57 is the probability of the pair of events : measurement with result @xmath3 and then successful uncollapsing .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ p_s - dm ] ) and ( [ gen - result ] ) we easily find the relation p_s = p_m(_in ) p_s = |c|^2 [ tildep ] and the upper bound p_s p_m . [ tilde - p_s]notice that @xmath57 is independent of the initial state .",
    "while this property seems to be somewhat surprising , we will see later why it is rather obvious .",
    "if we now wish to consider all possible results of the first measurement , and perform different uncollapsing procedures for each measurement result , then the total probability of uncollapsing @xmath58 is bounded as p_s^total _",
    "m p_m , [ tilde - p_s - total]and is also independent of the initial state .",
    "the bounds ( [ tilde - p_s ] ) and ( [ tilde - p_s - total ] ) are exact and reachable by optimal uncollapsing procedures .",
    "the bound ( [ tilde - p_s - total ] ) indicates that @xmath59 can be used as a _ measure of irreversibility _ ( collapse strength ) due to the measurement operation .",
    "now let us discuss the relationship between the uncollapsing procedure and our knowledge of the initial state . while uncollapsing is possible",
    "even if we know nothing about the initial state of the system , at first glance it seems like we gain some knowledge about the initial state in the process .",
    "this leads to the following interesting paradox , initially considered by royer.@xcite by doing both a measurement and unmeasurement , one can seemingly learn something about the initial state without disturbing it . then by repeating the measurement + unmeasurement process many times , even though the probability of such an event rapidly decreases to zero , the successful event would lead to essentially perfect knowledge of the initial state , leaving the state itself perfectly intact ! one could then violate a host of known results , such as the no - cloning theorem .",
    "the resolution of the paradox lies in the fact that the pair of measurement and unmeasurement actually brings exactly _",
    "zero information_. uncollapsing the state can only occur when the information in the second measurement exactly contradicts the information gained in the first measurement , thus nullifying it .",
    "this can happen in weak quantum measurements because there is uncertainty about the system in the measurement result .",
    "it is to the extent that this ambiguity exists that it is possible to undo the weak measurement .",
    "let us examine this in more detail .",
    "we learn something about a pre - measurement state when the measurement result depends on the state .",
    "the measurement with result @xmath3 brings some information about @xmath39 because the probability @xmath60 depends on the initial state @xmath39 .",
    "the ability to successfully uncollapse the state _ also _ brings some information about the initial state because the uncollapsing probability @xmath61 also depends on @xmath39 .",

    "( [ tildep ] ) .",

    "more quantitatively , we can use the same framework as at the end of sec .",

    "let us also mention the fact from linear algebra that the singular value decomposition ( [ decompose ] ) is unique in the non - degenerate case ( @xmath241 ) , up to the permutation of singular values [ corresponding to the choice in eq .",

    "therefore , the first goal can be achieved by a unitary operation which rotates @xmath257 into @xmath253 , followed by a continuous measurement ( with a qpc ) of a non - evolving qubit , to be stopped when the mapped vectors become orthogonal .",
    "after the vectors @xmath260 are transformed into an orthogonal pair by the ( successful ) first measurement , the second part of the procedure should stretch / shrink the 2d hilbert space along the resulting vectors to make them equal in norm .",

    "finally , another unitary operation can be used to map the resulting pair of vectors into @xmath261 ) . to prove this non - optimality ,",
    "let us again use the initial eigenstate @xmath0 , which corresponds to eigenvalue @xmath246 , so that the bound ( [ p - s - ev - dm ] ) is 100% .",
    "then the probability of success for the first measurement is in general less than 100% ( it is 100% only for one specific axis discussed previously , while here we consider a range of possible axes by allowing @xmath259 to vary ) .",

    "it is a natural question if a similar kind of partial collapse / uncollapse can be carried over to spin qubits .",
    "an analysis of this situation was carried out by trauzettel , burkard , and one of the authors.@xcite there it was shown how an uncollapse measurement can be realized using a scheme similar to the recent experiments by koppens",
    "_ et al._@xcite the essential idea of the spin - qubit experiments @xcite is to manipulate and measure the spin of a single electron through the charge degree of freedom .",
    "this technique circumvents the otherwise difficult problem of controlling the weakly interacting spin . while we refer the reader to refs .",
    "for the details , we will give a simplified thumb - nail sketch of the physics here .",
    "the qubit is encoded with two electron spins , where each electron is confined in a separate quantum dot .",
    "in contrast to our charge qubit discussion , these dots are open , with electrons able to enter and leave .",
    "electrical bias is applied across this double quantum dot leading to charge transport .",
    "electrons can tunnel sequentially , but _",
    "spin blockade_@xcite restricts transport to situations where the two electrons form a spin singlet @xmath351 on the right dot while the spin triplet @xmath352 is outside the transport energy window due to the large single quantum dot exchange energy [ here @xmath353 refers to @xmath271 electrons on the left dot and @xmath3 electrons on the right dot ] .",
    "this blockade physics provides an interesting initialization procedure of the quantum register - when the single - electron current stops flowing , we are confident that the two - electron state is in a @xmath354 state , because in the absence of spin flip processes , the tunneling transition to the @xmath355 state is forbidden . from this configuration ,",
    "it is possible to manipulate the system by applying electron spin resonance pulses,@xcite transitioning the state to have overlap with the singlet state .",
    "thus , the electron on the left dot may tunnel ( with rate @xmath266 ) to the right dot and exit the system , giving rise to a small electrical current at the drain when this process is repeated many times . of course",
    ", this will happen with some probability controlled by the overlap of the state with the singlet .",
    "drawing on our experience with the phase qubit , it is clear how to devise a weak measurement experiment and an uncollapsing experiment : the allowed transition can be permitted for a time of one s choosing and then forbidden by detuning the energy levels with a voltage pulse to one of the quantum dot s gates . in this way",
    "one can weakly probe the two - electron state , and in the null - result case ( no single electron tunneling ) partially collapse it to the triplet subspace . in order to propose the uncollapse part of the experiment",
    ", it is easiest to consider the case when the nuclear spins quickly admixed the singlet state with a triplet state , permitting the two - qubit state to encode one effective qubit : parallel or anti - parallel spins .",
    "the weak measurement technique described above will then partially collapse the state toward the parallel state under a null - measurement ( no single electron tunneling ) .",
    "if now a @xmath285-pulse is applied to one of the spins with electron spin resonance , followed by a second null - measurement , this was shown to uncollapse the state of the effective qubit.@xcite      another interesting development is the experimental implementation of wavefunction uncollapse for optical qubits using the polarization degree of freedom of single photons by kim _",
    "et al._@xcite the weak measurement was implemented by passing the photon through a glass plate oriented at the brewster angle . only the vertical polarization is reflected off of the glass plate ( with some probability ) . by placing a single - photon detector where the photon would have gone",
    "had it reflected , a null - click measurement partially collapses the polarization state to the horizontal polarization .",
    "the strength of the measurement can be increased by placing a series of plates in a row , effectively increasing the net probability of a vertically - polarized photon reflecting at some point .",
    "the wavefunction uncollapse is done by inserting a half - wave plate ( exchanging the amplitude of horizontal with vertical polarization ) , and having the same number of plates traversed by the photon again .",
    "if none of the single - photon detectors click , the polarization state is uncollapsed .",
    "this has been verified @xcite with quantum state tomography ( with polarizer and single - photon counter placed after all of the reflecting plates ) on the photon , conditioned on none of the other photon detectors firing .",
    "the experiment showed an uncollapsing fidelity of above @xmath356 for measurement strengths up to 0.9 .",
    "it was also pointed out that the information from the first weak measurement can be used for developing guessing strategies about the unknown initial state .",
    "two such strategies were presented , and one was shown to be optimal . of course",
    ", in the case where the measurement was subsequently undone , these strategies did no better than random guessing .",
    "we have reviewed and extended recent developments in the theory ( and experiment ) of wavefunction uncollapse by undoing quantum measurements . we have formulated the problem of wavefunction uncollapse in terms of a contest between the uncollapse proponent , plato , and the uncollapse skeptic , socrates , monitored by the arbiter , aristotle .",
    "plato claims to have the ability to uncollapse wavefunctions , and this ability can be tested under the rules of the contest set forth .",
    "we have discussed several general features of the uncollapse process in the abstract case , such as the upper bound on the success probability and quantum information aspects of the problem . in order to probabilistically undo the measurement ,",
    "it is necessary to erase the information extracted about the state in the first measurement .",
    "this is a necessary condition to uncollapse the wavefunction , because otherwise various paradoxes arise .",
    "however , the information erasure is surely not a sufficient condition : the unitary evolution should also be properly reversed and , as the most experimentally challenging condition , the process should not bring decoherence , which requires a very good ( ideal ) detector .",
    "in addition to discussing the theory of wavefunction uncollapse in the abstract case , we have also considered a variety of solid - state implementations and specific practical strategies for wavefunction uncollapse .",
    "not only the success probability , these specific systems also allow the calculation of other characteristics of the process , such as the waiting time distribution for wavefunction uncollapse in the charge qubit case .",
    "the cases of the charge qubit ( with and without hamiltonian dynamics ) , the phase qubit , and many entangled charge qubits have been examined in detail .",
    "additionally , we have also discussed two experimental realizations of this physics , based on the phase qubit and the polarization qubit , both of which have clearly demonstrated wavefunction uncollapse with high fidelity .",
    "the ideality of the detector is necessary for perfect uncollapsing , and we have only dealt with these kinds of detectors in the theory section of this paper ( by this we mean the detector adds no extra decoherence to the system ) . if a detector is slightly non - ideal , then even a perfectly executed uncollapse strategy will result in a slight infidelity in the final state .",
    "this is indeed the case in the experiments mentioned above although the fidelity was quite high .",
    "in such a situation there are two characteristics to contend with : the fidelity of uncollapsing as well as the probability of claimed success .",
    "it is an open topic for future research how these characteristics are related .",
