    "deep inelastic scattering @xcite continues to provide important information on the structure of hadrons .",
    "phenomenological fits to experimental data give values for the moments of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , including estimates of their errors , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "since such moments can be expressed as expectation values of local operators , they are accessible to lattice calculations @xcite . a direct comparison of these lattice calculations of moments with the results of the phenomenological fits will test whether these fits are consistent with direct qcd predictions . if we think of , e.g. , precise determinations of the strong coupling constant from scaling violations in deep inelastic scattering , such non - trivial checks are mandatory .",
    "lattice results do not come for free , however : concepts of non - perturbative renormalization have to be developed ; in the process of moving from the continuum of space time to an euclidean lattice a non - vanishing value of a lattice spacing @xmath2 is introduced , leading to discretization effects ; running simulations on a computer necessitates the use of an only finite volume ; the limited amount of computing resources leads to the fact that simulations are performed at rather large values of the quark masses that are far from their values assumed in nature .",
    "in addition , at present we are left with the quenched approximation , neglecting internal quark degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , the numerical results are plagued by statistical errors that can be substantial for bad choices of operators .",
    "in the course of our work @xcite to reach a reliable value for a moment of a parton distribution function we eliminated important sources of systematic errors besides the quenched approximation ( see @xcite for summaries of these works ) .",
    "the transition to full dynamical simulations is undertaken world - wide today @xcite and the next years will see the exciting results of such calculations .",
    "another open question is the chiral extrapolation that is not understood presently ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "let us sketch how we have addressed the systematic errors of the lattice calculations in our work :    * _ non - perturbative renormalization _ + we adopt in our work @xcite the schrdinger functional ( sf ) scheme @xcite , which has been proved to be a very successful and practical way to compute scale dependent renormalization constants .",
    "by evolving deep into the perturbative regime , renormalization group invariant ( rgi ) quantities can be determined that allow to relate lattice results into any desired continuum renormalization scheme @xcite . in this paper",
    "we compute the renormalization factor at the matching scale ( see sect . [ sec.:3.2 ] for details ) . * _ discretization effects _ + we have controlled effects of a non - vanishing lattice spacing @xmath2 by performing all our lattice calculations with several values of @xmath2 with two different lattice formulations of lattice qcd : one is the standard wilson fermion , the other the non - perturbatively improved wilson fermion formulation . in this way ,",
    "all quantities could be extrapolated to their continuum value in a controlled way performing a constrained continuum limit . in particular in this work",
    "we have used this strategy to control the continuum limit of the renormalized matrix element . * _ finite size effects _ + the finite size effects were controlled in two ways . for the computation of the evolution of the renormalization constants @xcite ,",
    "the finite volume schrdinger functional scheme was used , in which the scale @xmath3 is identified with the inverse lattice extent @xmath4 . in this way , the finiteness of the lattice has been utilized to determine the scale dependence .",
    "+ for the matrix elements , a careful test of finite size effects has been performed @xcite with the somewhat surprising result that such effects are rather large for the pion matrix element at a point where the pion mass itself shows no effects .",
    "since this was done for pion matrix elements only , it will be very important to repeat the analysis for baryon matrix elements , where such effects are expected to be even larger @xcite . * _ statistical errors _",
    "+ by employing generalized boundary conditions in space , the signal to noise ratio of operators that need an external momentum could be minimized by optimizing parameters that are introduced by the generalized boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to obtain results that would not have been possible otherwise . * _ chiral extrapolation _ + the extrapolation of the numerical data from the rather heavy quark masses , where the simulations are performed , to their physical values is still under debate and not clarified , see @xcite for a general discussion , and for works on the chiral extrapolation of pdf .",
    "we will follow the strategy in this work that we first extrapolate the values of our non - perturbatively improved matrix elements to the continuum limit .",
    "comparisons to predictions of chiral perturbation theory are then performed directly in the continuum in order to avoid lattice spacing effects that would render the interpretation difficult .    after having understood and",
    "overcome the above difficulties , we can now provide results that are free of these systematic uncertainties besides the , presently still unavoidable , quenched approximation . in this work",
    "we summarize our result and , most importantly , we provide the missing part , i.e. the renormalized matrix element at the hadronic scale @xmath5 down to which the scale evolution has been computed ( @xcite ) , with a full control on the continuum limit and a carefull analysis of the chiral extrapolation . as the most important quantity we consider the _ renormalization group invariant _ ( rgi )",

    "= 0.179(11 ) .",
    "[ rgiresult ]    this quantity is of central importance since it allows to relate the non - perturbatively obtained results using a particular lattice renormalization scheme to more conventional schemes .",
    "for example , if we use the @xmath6 scheme , we find that at a scale of 2 gev the value of the matrix element compares to phenomenological estimates of the same quantities extracted from global fits of experimental data @xcite as follows : of this paper . ]",
    "@xmath7    this results demonstrates that the running of moments of parton distribution functions in the _ continuum _ can be calculated from lattice simulations in an intrinsic perturbative scheme like the @xmath6 retaining all the non - perturbative information coming from the rgi matrix element .",
    "in addition , the errors coming from the lattice simulations are comparable to the experimental errors , which opens the possibility to perform direct tests of qcd as the theory of the strong interaction .",
    "the moments of parton density distributions are related to expectation values of local operators , which are renormalized multiplicatively by applying appropriate renormalization factors @xmath8 that depend on the energy scale @xmath3 ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "this leads to consider renormalized matrix elements @xmath9 using some renormalization scheme , denoted by _",
    "ren_. for lattice calculations , we are aiming at here , a very useful scheme is the schrdinger function ( sf ) renormalization scheme @xcite since it applies in small volumes .",
    "if the energy scale @xmath3 of @xmath8 is chosen large enough , it is to be expected , and indeed it can be checked explicitly , that the scale evolution is very well described by perturbation theory , giving rise to the following definition of a _ renormalization group invariant _ ( rgi ) matrix element : @xmath10 with @xmath11 the running coupling computed in the same sf scheme and @xmath12\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the @xmath15 and anomalous - dimension functions computed to a given order of perturbation theory in a specified scheme , i.e. here the sf scheme .",
    "once we know the value of @xmath16 evaluated non - perturbatively , the running matrix element in a preferred scheme can be computed , for example in the @xmath6 scheme : @xmath17 with now , of course , the @xmath15 and @xmath18 functions computed in the @xmath6 scheme .",
    "thus , although the sf is an unphysical finite volume scheme ( but therefore most suited for lattice simulations ) it can be related to more conventional continuum renormalization schemes by providing the renormalization group invariant quantities .",
    "a non - perturbatively obtained value of the renormalization group invariant matrix element is hence of central importance .",
    "its calculation has to be performed in several steps .",
    "the reason is that we have to cover a broad range of energy scales  from the deep perturbative to the non - perturbative region . using the scale dependent renormalization factor @xmath19 , we write the renormalized matrix element of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inv ] ) as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hadron state we are interested in .",
    "so far , all our discussions have been in the continuum .",
    "however , if we think of the lattice regularization and eventual numerical simulations to obtain non - perturbative results , it would be convenient to compute the renormalized matrix element at only one ( i.e. small hadronic ) scale @xmath22 .",
    "we therefore rewrite the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : split ] ) as @xmath23 where we introduce the step scaling function @xmath24 , which describes the evolution of the renormalization factor from a scale @xmath22 to a scale @xmath3 .",
    "the advantage of concentrating on the step scaling function instead of the renormalization factor itself is that the step scaling function is well defined in the continuum and hence suitable for eventual continuum extrapolations of lattice results .",
    "we finally write the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : inv ] ) as @xmath25 with @xmath26 the renormalized matrix element , which is to be computed only once at a scale @xmath22 and the ultraviolet ( uv ) invariant step scaling function @xmath27 , which still depends on the infrared scale @xmath22 , and on the renormalization scheme adopted . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have given a value for the uv invariant step scaling function and checked the independence on the ultraviolet scale @xmath3 . in this work",
    "we will provide the missing part , i.e. the renormalized matrix element at the scale @xmath22 .",
    "the final result for the renormalized matrix element of the pion that we are going to provide here , was made possible by a number of theoretical and conceptual developments that we could achieve over the last years @xcite .",
    "the methods developed there can immediately be taken over to other matrix elements than the lowest twist case of the pion considered here and to the unquenched situation .",
    "nevertheless , with this paper we want to finish the analysis of the pion matrix element with the aim to have eliminated important systematic uncertainties besides the quenched approximation .",
