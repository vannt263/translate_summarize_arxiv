    "confinement in qcd is a non - perturbative phenomenon and lattice gauge theory techniques are well suited to its study .",
    "one of the simplest manifestations of confinement in pure glue qcd is the potential energy @xmath6 between static quarks at separation @xmath7 which increases with @xmath7 . to investigate this in detail , it is possible to probe the spatial distribution of the colour fields around such static quarks .",
    "this exploration of the nature of the flux between static quarks has a long history .",
    "typical points of interest are the transverse extent of the flux - tube and the nature of the colour fields ( i.e. electric or magnetic ) .",
    "a hadronic string approach gives a reasonable description of the interquark potential at large separation .",
    "here we explore this further by investigating the distribution of colour fields for gluonic excitations of this potential and comparing our results with models for the flux - tube in this case also .    on a lattice",
    "the technique to explore the colour field distributions is to measure the correlation of a plaquette @xmath8 [ here defined as @xmath9 with the generalised wilson loop @xmath10 that creates the static quark - antiquark at separation @xmath7 . see fig",
    ".  1 for an illustration . locating the plaquette at @xmath11 , in the limit @xmath12 the following expression isolates the contribution from the colour field at position @xmath13 from the plaquette oriented in the @xmath14 plane .",
    "@xmath15\\ ] ]    these contributions are related in the naive continuum limit to the mean squared fluctuation of the minkowski colour fields by @xmath16 we shall wish to distinguish electric and magnetic colour fields with different orientations with respect to the interquark separation axis ( longitudinal  taken as 1-axis ) and adopt the notation that @xmath17 it will be convenient to discuss combinations corresponding naively to the action ( @xmath18 ) and energy ( @xmath19 ) densities of the gluon field .",
    "these are given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 note that since the colour field contributions come from a cancellation between the value in a static potential and that in the vacuum , either sign is possible .",
    "the colour field distributions are quite difficult to measure on a lattice because the correlation of eq .",
    "( [ fmnt ] ) involves delicate cancellations .",
    "recent results  @xcite and  @xcite have concentrated on the simpler case of su(2 ) colour in order to achieve sufficient statistical accuracy .",
    "it is expected that the salient features of confinement in su(2 ) are very similar to those in the realistic case of su(3 ) . here",
    "we focus our attention on the colour field distributions at @xmath22 for which the lattice spacing @xmath23 fm should be sufficiently small for our purposes .",
    "the action and energy densities are measured on a lattice by using plaquettes of area @xmath24 and hence do not have a continuum limit as @xmath25 . to achieve a continuum limit would require to measure energy and action by using loops of fixed physical size rather than plaquettes . in the following , we quote our results in lattice units with the normalisation as given above in eq .",
    "( [ fmnt ] ) .",
    "different strategies have been used to improve the signal to noise in the lattice determination of the colour fields .",
    "here we focus on one method , as described in sect .",
    "3 , which is to create operators which produce ground state potentials with very little contamination of excited states .",
    "as described in the next section , we are able to achieve this using fuzzed links and a variational approach . because we wish to study sum rules which involve sums over all spatial positions",
    ", we do not employ multi - hit techniques such as those used in ref .",
    "we do not use , either , the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite to treat @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ fmnt ] ) as a quasi local average of the plaquette in the correlation since , although it reduces the noise , it also modifies the signal .",
    "lattice sum rules have been derived  @xcite which relate the sum over all space of the plaquette correlation to expressions involving the potential @xmath6 and generalised @xmath2-functions .",
    "these sum rules have been used in an attempt to extract such @xmath2-functions  @xcite . here",
    "we consider a larger set of sum rules and we make a careful evaluation of these sum rules to extract the generalised @xmath2-functions and to validate our methods .",
    "this is described in sect .",
    "a preliminary account has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we present our results for the spatial distributions of the colour fields in sect .",
    "one feature that goes beyond previous work , is that we also measure the colour field distribution in the lowest lying gluonic excitation of the static quark potential .",
    "this lowest gluonic excitation has non - zero angular momentum about the interquark axis and plays a role in hybrid meson spectroscopy .",
    "hadronic string models predict such excited modes and agreement with the energy levels determined on a lattice has been found  @xcite . here",
    "we are able to explore the spatial distribution of this excited gluonic mode to make more detailed comparisons with models .",
    "we have also explored a higher gluonic excited state : the first excited state with the symmetry of the ground state . in this case",
    "we have been unable to extract unambiguously the colour fields associated with this state so we do not report on it further here .",
    "to explore the colour field distributions around static quarks at separation @xmath7 , we need to find efficient lattice operators to create such states .",
    "efficient here means having a small contamination of excited states while still allowing a good signal to noise for correlations of interest .",
    "we build on the experience of studying the corresponding potentials  @xcite and use an iterative fuzzing prescription to create the spatial paths @xmath27 of length @xmath7 , where different levels of iteration of fuzzing are represented by @xmath28 . in detail , we use a number of recursive iterations of replacing each spatial link by the projected sum of ( ) and then multiply these fuzzed links to make the spatial path needed .",
    "the correlation of spatial path @xmath27 at time @xmath29 and @xmath30 at time @xmath31 then gives the generalised wilson loop @xmath32 - see fig .",
    "we use a @xmath33 lattice at @xmath22 for this study with the @xmath0 gauge group . for many purposes",
    "@xmath0 colour provides an excellent test bed for qcd studies . in this work",
    "the scale as set by the string tension corresponds to a lattice spacing @xmath34 gev@xmath35 fm .",
    "the data sample used comes from a comprehensive study of 80 blocks ( 60 blocks for @xmath36 ) of 125 measurements separated by 4 update sweeps ( 3 over - relaxation plus one heatbath ) .",
    "error estimates use a full bootstrap analysis of these blocks .",
    "the fuzzed link operator @xmath27 to create a static quark and antiquark at separation @xmath7 with colour field in a state of a given lattice symmetry will have an expansion in terms of the eigenstates of the transfer matrix @xmath37 with the measured correlation of a generalised wilson loop given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 we shall see that the contamination by excited states needs to be minimised so that @xmath40 , while , in order to retain a reasonable signal to noise , we should like to achieve this with @xmath41 . in order to calibrate the contamination by excited states we show in table  1 the results for the effective potential defined as @xmath42.\\ ] ] we measure the generalised correlation to @xmath43 for @xmath44 and to @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the signal is too noisy at larger @xmath47-values to be a useful guide .",
    "we use a variational method with a combination of paths with different fuzzing levels chosen so that the effective potential is minimised for @xmath48 . this combination",
    "is then used at all @xmath47 and gives the effective potential values shown in table  1 . as an estimate of the true ground state potential energy one could use the @xmath43 effective potential",
    ", however , this is an upper limit because of excited state contributions .",
    "another estimate can be made by assuming  @xcite that the change in effective energy from @xmath49 to 4 , namely @xmath50 , is given entirely by the contribution of one excited state with an energy difference @xmath51 determined by the variational analysis outlined above .",
    "defining @xmath52 , this extrapolated estimate will lie below @xmath53 by @xmath54 and this value is shown in table  1 labelled as @xmath12 .",
    "the difference between these two methods to extract the ground state potential energy gives an estimate of the systematic error from extrapolation in @xmath47 .",
    "the potentials are the data points plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "in order to estimate the magnitude of the excited state contamination in the state for @xmath41 , we use the same approximation of one excited state only for @xmath55 .",
    "then one has that @xmath56 .",
    "the values of @xmath57 shown in the tables are for @xmath41 which corresponds to our operator having contamination @xmath57 at @xmath58 , namely one time step away .",
    "we see that for the symmetric ( a@xmath59 ) representation , the contamination @xmath57 is quite small .",
    "we also study potentials between static quarks with gluonic excitations in the e@xmath1 representation . for this case",
    "@xcite we need u - shaped paths ( actually the combination @xmath60 with the extension in the transverse spatial direction ) . for this representation , we also need to extract the ground state , and results from generalised wilson loops are given in table  2 . here",
    "we have used a single fuzzing level but two different values of the transverse extent @xmath61 of the u - shaped paths . as shown ,",
    "the excited state contaminations are significantly higher for this representation than for the symmetric a@xmath59 case .    .",
    "potential energy values for the symmetric a@xmath59 case .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]     since the bbz model ( unlike that of ip ) is not a semi - classical model and contains explicitly the trace anomaly , it may be possible to also make realistic predictions about the action",
    ". this would be of considerable interest , since the value of the action is much larger than that of the energy and so on the lattice can be extracted with greater accuracy to larger values of @xmath62 and so serve even better in comparisons with the bbz model .",
    "we evaluated sum rules for the action , longitudinal energy and transverse energy for a range of @xmath7-values .",
    "we conclude that all the sum rules at @xmath22 are consistent with a set of generalised @xmath2-functions with values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "these non - perturbative values are not in agreement with those obtained by the first two terms in the perturbative expression .",
    "an extension of our methods to larger @xmath2-values would be of interest to study this discrepancy as the coupling constant is decreased .",
    "the distribution of the colour fields around a static quark and antiquark at separation @xmath7 has been explored . for the symmetric ground state potential ( a@xmath59 ) ,",
    "the results are in agreement with previous studies .",
    "we also determine the distribution for the lowest gluonic excitation ( e@xmath1 ) for the first time . for this excited state",
    ", the action distribution shows a central node in its transverse dependence .",
    "the general features of the energy distribution are an enhanced contribution in the transverse energy and a flatter distribution with @xmath62 .",
    "these features are compared with string inspired models and with intuition from sum rules . although no comprehensive model for the observed behaviour is currently available ,",
    "two positive features emerge .",
    "firstly , the isgur - paton model @xcite predicts an energy profile that has a very similar shape to that of the electric field squared ( @xmath65 ) on the lattice ( figs .",
    "10c , d ) and , secondly , the dual potential model of baker , ball and zachariasen@xcite predicts the correct trend for the shape of the lattice energy profile even for small values of @xmath7 , where their model should not be applicable ( table 3 ) .",
