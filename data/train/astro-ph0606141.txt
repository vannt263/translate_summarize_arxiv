    "black hole x - ray binaries are generally observed to be in two distinct states .",
    "these states , which are named hard and soft , differ in their luminosity and spectral shapes . in the hard state , which is in general less luminous",
    ", the spectrum of the system can be described as a hard power - law with a spectral index @xmath7 and a cutoff around @xmath8 kev .",
    "this spectrum can be modeled as thermal comptonization of soft photons by a plasma having temperature @xmath9 kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the spectrum during the soft state consists of a blackbody - like component with @xmath10 kev , which typically dominates the luminosity and is generally considered to be thermal emission from an optically thick accretion disk . apart from this soft ( or disk ) component , a hard x - ray power - law tail , with photon index @xmath11 and no detectable cutoff up to @xmath12 mev @xcite , is also observed .",
    "there have been several interpretations of the high energy ( @xmath13 kev ) emission from black hole systems .",
    "it may arise from a photon starved inner most region of a disk which cools due to bremsstrahlung self - comptonization @xcite or as emission due to @xmath14 decay , which are created by proton - proton interaction in a hot proton gas , @xmath15 k @xcite .",
    "while these possibilities maybe viable , they are based on assumptions of the geometry and physical properties of the system , which are not directly and independently verifiable , like the presence of a very hot proton gas or a photon starved region .",
    "another interpretation is that the spectra arises due to comptonization of photons by the bulk motion of matter falling into the black hole @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have argued that the non - detection of spectral breaks at @xmath16 kev is contrary to this model s prediction .",
    "a detailed radiative model , which has been used to fit good quality broad band data of black hole systems , is the hybrid model which is inscribed in a spectral fitting code called eqpair @xcite . in the framework of this model , this high energy component arises from a plasma consisting of both thermal and non - thermal electrons that comptonize external soft photons .",
    "detailed spectral modeling of the observed soft state spectra demands the coexistence of thermal and non - thermal electrons in the emission region and hence the steady state non - thermal electron distribution is computed by assuming that there is an injection of non - thermal particles into the system where they cool by comptonization and coulomb interactions .",
    "the origin of these non - thermal particles is uncertain .",
    "a possible site may be a corona on top of a cold disk which is heated by magnetic field reconnections @xcite , but the details of the process are largely unknown .",
    "the acceleration process has to be highly efficient to produce non - thermal electrons in an environment where electrons cool rapidly by inverse comptonization .",
    "if this acceleration process is mass - independent then protons are also expected to be accelerated to relativistic energies , for example by scattering off magnetic `` kinks '' in a keplerian accretion disk @xcite .",
    "some of these non - thermal protons may escape from the system and contribute to the jet formation @xcite .",
    "this is particularly interesting since there are some evidence that the x - ray producing region may be same as the base of the extended jet @xcite .",
    "hence the detection of these non - thermal protons will provide valuable clues to the nature of black hole systems .",
    "non - thermal protons would interact with the ambient thermal protons and produce electron - positron pairs , which would comptonize photons to high energies .",
    "these high energy photons would produce further pairs by @xmath2 interaction and a pair cascade would ensue .",
    "pair cascades initiated by the injection of pairs ( or equivalently high energy non - thermal electrons ) have been extensively examined ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of @xmath4 interactions and the resultant spectra have also been computed and studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", did not consider the presence of copious photons or have assumed that the ambient photons are in the uv range , a scenario relevant to agn and under - luminous black hole systems .",
    "however , for black hole binaries , the system is dominated by either soft or hard x - rays depending on the spectral state .",
    "one of the important radiative interaction that would occur in such an environment is the inverse compton scattering of x - rays by pairs with lorentz factor @xmath17 that are produced by the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "the standard methods to compute the inverse compton spectra , assume that the interaction in the rest frame of the electron takes place in the non - relativistic thompson limit , which is true only if electron lorentz factor times the photon energy @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "this assumption is violated if the ambient photon energy is @xmath20 kev .",
    "thus , when @xcite considered @xmath4 interaction in the presence of blackbody photons having temperature @xmath21 kev , they used a general formalism to describe the inverse compton process given by @xcite .",
    "they found that for such a situation , which is relevant to the soft state of black hole binaries , the effect of non - thermal protons is to produce a broad feature around @xmath22 mev . using the observed osse data for grs 1915 + 105",
    ", they could constrain the fraction of non - thermal protons in the system to be @xmath23 . although @xcite , computed the change in energy of the photon ( and hence the change in energy of the lepton ) appropriately in the klein - nishina regime , they used , for simplicity , a diffusion equation to describe the kinetic evolution of the pairs , which intrinsically assumes that the change in energy of the particle per scattering is small .",
    "this assumption breaks down when the ambient photon energy is in x - rays , especially when there are a copious amount of ambient hard x - rays .    in this work , we extend the formalism developed by @xcite , by solving an integro - differential equation for the pair kinetic evolution which correctly takes into account the large energy changes that a lepton undergoes upon scattering with an x - ray photon .",
    "this not only allows for a more accurate estimation of the emergent spectra for systems in the soft state , but enables the scheme to be applied to the hard state also .    in",

    "we consider a uniform sphere of non - relativistic thermal plasma with number density @xmath27 and radius @xmath28 , in the presence of an external copious photon source .",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the luminosity of the external photons @xmath29 , in terms of the compactness parameter @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the thomson cross - section .",

    "the output spectrum depends on the spectral shape of the external photons and three other parameters : the thomson optical depth @xmath75 , photon compactness @xmath76 and the ratio of proton - proton compactness @xmath77 , to that of the external photon , @xmath78 .",
    "the results are insensitive to the non - thermal proton index @xmath32 and apart for an overall normalization factor , to the size @xmath28 of the system . from the definition of compactness ( @xmath79 )",
    ", it follows that for a fixed value of @xmath80 , the normalization of the photon spectrum will be proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "the spectral shape primarily depends on the inverse compton and pair production processes , which are characterized by @xmath81 and @xmath82 . since the soft photon density @xmath83 and similarly ,",
    "the high energy photon density , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are independent of @xmath28 for specified compactness .",
    "thus , parameterizing the luminosities in terms of compactness renders the shape of the spectrum to be nearly independent of the size of the system .",
    "the computed radiated spectra due to @xmath4 interactions , corresponding to parameters typical of the soft state of black hole binaries , are shown in figure [ soft_gen_spec_a ] . since the motivation of this work is to investigate the possibility that the @xmath0-ray part of the spectrum is due to @xmath4 interactions , a detailed fit to the broad band data , especially the low energy part of the spectrum , is not being attempted . instead ,",
    "the dominant soft component is being represented by a a wien peak like spectrum at @xmath87 kev and high compactness , @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity is @xmath89 where @xmath90 cm is the size of the system .",
    "the optical depth of the thermal electrons is of order unity and is taken to be @xmath91 in figure [ soft_gen_spec_a ] .",
    "the spectra plotted in the figure , correspond to three different values of the compactness ratio @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which represent increasing efficiency of the acceleration process to produce non - thermal protons . at low @xmath95 values",
    "the spectra are hard with a break around @xmath96 mev .",
    "this cutoff is due to the interaction of higher energy photons with the ambient soft photons of energy @xmath97 kev to generate pairs .",
    "the hard spectra are due to inverse comptonization of photons by a steady state pair distribution @xmath98 ( figure [ soft_gen_spec_b ] ) .",
    "such a distribution is expected when pairs are injected at a large energy ( @xmath99 ) and are cooled by inverse comptonization .",
    "essentially in the diffusion approximation , the cooling rate @xmath100 , which leads to @xmath101 when pair creation due to photon - photon interaction can be neglected . for higher compactness ratio , @xmath102 , pair creation due to photon - photon interaction affects the particle distribution at low @xmath0 ( figure [ soft_gen_spec_b ] ) , which leads to a softer output spectra ( figure [ soft_gen_spec_a ] ) . for still larger values of @xmath103",
    ", apart from the change in particle distribution due to photon - photon pair production , another break at around @xmath104 kev appears in the radiated spectrum , since the density of high energy photons is large enough for pairs to be produced by self interaction .",
    "figure [ soft_gen_spec_a ] also shows for comparison , the computed spectra obtained using the diffusion approximation to solve for the particle distribution as described in @xcite .",
    "while , quantitative differences can be seen when the compactness ratio is large ( spectra marked 2 and 3 ) , the qualitative features of the spectra are similar .    the high energy ( 550 ) soft state spectra are characterized by a steep power - law of photon index @xmath105 , and hence can not be explained as emission from @xmath4 interactions , since in this energy range the expected spectral index is @xmath106 ( figure [ soft_gen_spec_a ] ) .",
    "indeed , the soft state spectra can be described by the hybrid model , where non - thermal electrons are injected into a plasma . in figure [ cyg_soft ]",
    "we reproduce the unfolded data points based on such a model ( the `` eqpair '' model ) as fitted by @xcite .",
    "these data obtained from instruments on board the _ bepposax _ and _ cgro _ satellites cover a wide energy range from @xmath107 kev to @xmath108 mev .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the spectrum at energies @xmath109 mev can be represented as an extension of the non - thermal spectra at hard x - rays . on the other hand , the @xmath0-ray ( i.e. the 18 mev ) spectrum , maybe due to an additional component , especially since there are uncertainties about the relative normalization of the different instruments used to make the composite spectrum .",
    "a second component interpretation is supported by the non - detection by comptel of any flux in the energy range from @xmath110 kev to @xmath111 mev , indicating a possible spectral break in that region , although the low statistics of the data does not allow for a definite conclusion .",
    "thus , we attempt to fit the @xmath0-ray part of the spectrum , as emission from @xmath4 interactions , using parameters that are consistent with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "the required compactness ratio @xmath112 @xmath113 , can be compared with @xmath114 obtained by the eqpair fit .",
    "this indicates that if the @xmath0-ray spectrum is due to @xmath4 collisions , the energetics of the proton acceleration that produces non - thermal protons is comparable to the electron one .",
    "the factor of two difference , between the two ratios , could be either due to the neutrino emission , which has not been added to @xmath77 or to the uncertainties involved in the theoretical modeling and fitting of the data .",
    "if the @xmath0 ray spectrum is not due to this process , the above estimate serves as an upper limit on the energetics of the non - thermal acceleration of the protons . for the parameters used to compute the p - p component",
    ", the ratio of the non - thermal proton density to the thermal one turns out to be @xmath115 , which is consistent with that estimated earlier by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have estimated the sensitivity of a @xmath116 s _ glast _ observation to be @xmath117 kev @xmath118 s@xmath119 at 10 gev .",
    "figure [ cyg_soft ] shows that the predicted spectrum at that energy is a couple of order of magnitude higher than this limit and would be easily detectable .",
    "the extension of the hybrid plasma model fit to the data @xcite to 10 gev also predicts a similar flux .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , the hybrid plasma model assumes a low value of compactness @xmath120 and a high value of the maximum lorentz factor of the electrons , @xmath121 . for a more realistic value of compactness or",
    "if electrons are not accelerated to such high energies , there will be a sharp cutoff in the hybrid plasma spectrum at @xmath122 gev .",
    "glast _ observation of cyg x-1 ( or black hole binaries in general ) during the soft state , should be able to discern between these models .    black hole systems exhibit a variation of the soft state spectrum , which is sometimes denoted as a separate state and",
    "is called very high or intermediate state ( vhs / is ) . here",
    "the hard x - ray power - law is nearly equally luminous as the soft component .",
    "the black hole system grs 1915 + 105 displays a wide variety of spectral shape and its @xmath123 class behavior ( as classified by @xcite ) is similar to the vhs state of other black hole systems . @xcite",
    "have fitted the broad band data of this source obtained from instruments on board _ rxte _ and _ cgro _",
    ", by the hybrid model and the unfolded data based on that model is reproduced in figure [ grschi ] .",
    "the absence of high energy comptel data does not allow for detailed fits , but a comparison of the @xmath124 kev flux with the computed spectrum provides an upper limit of the compactness ratio @xmath125 , which again can be compared to the ratio @xmath114 required by the hybrid model fit @xcite .",
    "another variation of the soft state spectra is the so called ultra - soft state , where the spectrum is dominated by the soft blackbody like emission , with a weak hard x - ray tail .",
    "this state has been observed in many black hole systems like grs 1915 + 105 , gx 339 - 4 and xte j1550 - 564 .",
    "an example of this state is shown in figure [ grsgamma ] . here",
    "the data is reproduced from @xcite , and is unfolded based on the eqpair model fit to observation of grs 1915 + 105 in the @xmath0 class using _ rxte _ and _ cgro _ satellites .",
    "a remarkable observational feature is that for all these sources , the weak high energy tail is hard with a photon spectral index @xmath126 , for which currently there is no theoretical explanation @xcite . for high compactness the spectra due to @xmath4 interaction ,",
    "is expected to have such a hard spectral slope ( figure [ soft_gen_spec_a ] ) .",
    "indeed as shown in figure [ grsgamma ] , the hard x - ray spectra can be explained solely as emission from such a process with a compactness ratio @xmath127 .",
    "again , the absence of data greater than @xmath111 mev does not allow for a clear identification .",
    "however , the data is consistent with the hypothesis , that in the ultra - soft state , the emission from accelerated non - thermal electrons is absent and hence , only the hard spectra arising from @xmath4 interactions is observed .      .",
    "[ hard_gen_spec_a ]    figures [ hard_gen_spec_a ] and [ hard_gen_spec_b ] show the computed spectra and particle densities for different values of compactness ratio @xmath95 , when the ambient photon density is similar to that found in the hard state of black hole binaries . in this state , the spectrum is dominated by a thermal comptonized component , which is approximated here as an exponentially cut off power law with photon index @xmath128 and cut off energy @xmath129 kev .",
    "as the average photon energy in the plasma is higher than that of the soft state , the cut - off in the photon spectrum due to pair production appears at @xmath130 mev instead of @xmath131 mev . in the soft state ,",
    "the shape of the computed spectra and particle density depended on the compactness ratio @xmath95 .",
    "this was due to increasing self - interaction of the non - thermal photons to produce pairs as compactness increased .",
    "however , in the hard state , since the number density of ambient photons with energy @xmath132 kev is large , pair production is dominated by interaction of non - thermal photons with the background ambient ones even for large compactness .",
    "thus , the shape of the computed spectra is relatively invariant to @xmath95 as shown in figure [ hard_gen_spec_a ] and in particular the slope of the expected spectrum at energies @xmath133 mev is insensitive to the parameters of the model .",
    "figure [ hard_gen_spec_a ] also shows for comparison , the computed spectral components due to @xmath4 interaction , obtained using the diffusion approximation to solve for the particle distribution as described in @xcite .",
    "similar to what was found for the soft state ( figure [ soft_gen_spec_a ] ) , only quantitative differences can be seen while the qualitative features of the spectra are similar .",
    "this suggests that even when the ambient photons have energy @xmath134 kev , the diffusion approximation can reveal the salient features of the high energy spectrum .    the broadband hard state data of cyg x-1 , using _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ satellites , were analyzed and fitted using the eqpair model by @xcite",
    ". the unfolded data is reproduced in figure [ cyg_hard ] .",
    "most of the spectra can be represented by thermal comptonization , but there is evidence for a different high energy spectral component in the @xmath135 mev range , which was explained as emission from non - thermal electrons by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "here we compare the data with the computed spectra due to @xmath4 interactions , using parameters representative of the hard state and show that the the mev data , especially the spectral slope in that energy range , match with the observations .",
    "the required compactness ratio @xmath136 is similar to the values required to fit the soft state data , but smaller than @xmath137 required by the eqpair fit @xcite .",
    "the overall computed spectra fits even the data at energies @xmath138 kev remarkably well , however , this could be a coincidence given that an exponentially cutoff power - law is not a good approximation to a comptonized thermal spectrum and that reflection is not taken into account here .",
    "nevertheless , the fit in figure [ cyg_hard ] , strongly indicates that the emission from cyg x-1 in the hard state can be explained as thermal comptonization and a component due to @xmath4 interactions .",
    "the spectrum shown in figure [ cyg_hard ] , predicts that _ glast _ should be able to detect cyg x-1 in the hard state also .",
    "similar to the soft state , if the high energy emission is due to non - thermal electrons ( like in the eqpair model fit by @xcite ) a detection by _",
    "glast _ would only be possible under extreme conditions like low compactness and high maximum lorentz factor of the non - thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "glast _ would be able to differentiate between these models .",
