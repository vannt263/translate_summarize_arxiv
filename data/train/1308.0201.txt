    "2012 ; hinshaw et al .  2013",
    "; planck collaboration xvi 2013 ) . but observations of galaxy clusters have special advantages for understanding the abundance and distribution of matter , because 1 ) clusters are large enough that they are expected to retain the cosmic fraction of baryons , and 2 ) clusters are among the few astrophysical objects for which the three dominant forms of matter can be observed , namely : the gas mass ( @xmath6 ) , the stellar mass ( @xmath7 ) , and the dark matter mass ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , observations of the matter distribution in clusters as a function of physical scale and mass have typically been constrained only at low redshift ( @xmath9 ) .    at low redshift ,",
    "the best measurements of the baryon faction to date account for @xmath580% of the cosmic value ( for a recent review , see kravtsov et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the baryonic mass is dominated by an intra - cluster gas component ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "2006 ; arnaud et al .",
    "2007 ; sun et al .  2009 ) , with stars and galaxies typically contributing roughly one - tenth as much mass ( gonzalez et al .",
    "2007 ; giodini et al .",
    "2009 ; lin et al .",
    "however , the stellar mass fraction has also been found to be a strong function of cluster mass , with the stellar - to - gas fraction decreasing from @xmath50.25 to 0.05 from groups ( @xmath10 ) to massive clusters ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this can be interpreted to mean that star formation is much more efficient in the lower - mass groups compared to rich clusters ( e.g. , muzzin et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "in contrast with observations , simulations generally predict that the stellar fraction is approximately constant with cluster mass , and over - predict the amount of stars formed by a factor of @xmath525 in massive clusters ( e.g. , kravtsov et al .",
    "more recently , simulations have tried to evoke various types of astrophysical feedback ( e.g. , supernovae and active galactic nuclei ) to suppress star formation and match the observed stellar and intracluster medium fraction , with some success ( e.g. , planelles et al .",

    "do the observations underestimate the total diffuse stellar mass in the form of intra - cluster light ?",
    ". how do the relationships between cluster gas , dark matter , and stars evolve with redshift ?",
    "given that clusters are built hierarchically from mergers of lower - mass groups , in the simplest scenario one might expect these relations to be significantly steeper at higher redshift .",

    "2009 ; papovich et al .",
    "2010 ; stanford et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , the cluster searches carried out to date are not fully characterized in terms of purity , completeness , or mass proxies ( via comparison with cluster samples identified at other wavelengths ) , hindering interpretations that depend upon either cluster mass or ensemble properties .    here",
    "we describe a new wide - area irac survey that will make it possible to combine groundbreaking datasets from the south pole telescope and _ xmm _ with coextensive infrared imaging to address the questions posed above .",
    "we call this the _ spitzer_-south pole telescope deep field ( ssdf ) survey . the ssdf depth and coverage",
    "are compared to those of other major irac survey projects in figure  [ fig : etendue ] .",
    "the combination of infrared , millimeter , and x - ray data provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously calibrate the irac search techniques via comparison with sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) and x - ray cluster samples , and to robustly determine the cluster selection functions at the depths simultaneously probed by the three techniques .",
    "a limitation of the present generation of x - ray and sz surveys is that they lack the sensitivity at high redshift to identify clusters down to @xmath14 m@xmath15 and below , as is possible with irac .",
    "reaching these mass scales at higher redshifts is critical for understanding the assembly history of the present day cluster population , as these low - mass systems are the direct progenitors of typical present - day clusters , like virgo .",

    "we carried out our survey in a field that benefits from an abundance of supporting data from x - ray to radio wavelengths , and which has extremely low levels of galactic dust emission , being among the cleanest 1% of contiguous 100deg@xmath0 regions on the sky as measured in the 100@xmath4 m iras map ( finkbeiner et al .",

    "roughly 12deg@xmath0 in the center of the ssdf were observed with _",
    "spitzer_/irac in cycle 4 ( pi stanford , pid 40370 ) with three dithered 30s exposures .",
    "these observations were incorporated into the ssdf and are hereafter referred to as the s - bcs ( _ spitzer_-blanco cosmology survey ) . because it was obtained during _ spitzer _",
    "s cryogenic mission , the s - bcs dataset includes exposures at 5.8 and 8.0@xmath4 m , although those two long - wavelenth bands were not analyzed as part of the present work because they are significantly less sensitive than our new irac imaging .",
    "the ssdf has already been fully covered at 95 , 150 , and 220ghz to 1@xmath3 depths of 2 , 1 , and 3mjybeam@xmath20 , respectively by the south pole telescope ( spt ) during its survey of more than 2500deg@xmath0 of the southern sky ( carlstrom et al .",
    "2011 ; story et al .",
    "the spt provides an efficient means to detect high - redshift dusty galaxies ( e.g. , vieira et al .",
    "2013 ) , but it is particularly effective for identifying galaxy clusters via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sz ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) .",
    "the sz selection technique is relatively insensitive to cluster redshift , so the spt observations are capable of identifying galaxy clusters out to great distances ( e.g. , reichardt et al .  2013 ) . over the next four years , even deeper observations by sptpol ( austermann et al .",
    "2012 ) , which has already imaged this field to nearly twice the depth of the larger spt survey ( story et al .  2012 ) will further improve the quality and depth of the millimeter data in this field .",
    "its southern location means that it is well - placed for followup observations with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array , and is a promising candidate for selection as one of the large synoptic survey telescope deep drilling fields .",
    "the observing plan drew heavily on our team s prior experience with the irac shallow survey ( eisenhardt et al .",
    "the observations were arranged to account for and smoothly extend the pre - existing irac coverage from the s - bcs ( 3@xmath2330s depth over 12 deg@xmath0 ) .",
    "they also had to accommodate the position angle ( pa ) constraints of the two observing windows opening six months apart as well as the ssdf boundaries .",
    "the ssdf lies between declinations @xmath24deg and @xmath25deg , and from right ascension 23hr to slightly east of 0hr ( figure  [ fig : field2 ] ) . to accommodate these constraints ,",
    "the ssdf was covered by astronomical observation requests ( aors ) having coverage footprints of various ( sometimes irregular ) shapes and sizes . when possible , standard irac grids were used to cover @xmath261deg@xmath0 areas in four passes ,",
    "each pass obtaining a single 30s exposure per position . around the edges of and in between these grids , we designed aors in fixed cluster mode so as to optimally cover irregular areas . like the aors covering areas having more regular shapes ,",
    "these gerrymandered observations were also organized into groups of four single - pass aors to cover each area , with a single 30s exposure obtained in each pass . in any one area ,",
    "the four aors were obtained over the course of a two - day window .",
    "the goal was to achieve uniform coverage to the greatest extent possible .",
    "each aor required 16hr to execute , ensuring at least 1hr between successive observations of each sky position . for typical asteroid motions of 25hr@xmath20 , asteroids will move distances much greater than the irac point spread function between aors",
    ". the four observations of each sky position therefore allowed asteroids to be excluded from the final mosaics with standard outlier rejection techniques .",
    "our mapping strategy was to dither the exposures on small scales , and offset by one - third of an irac field of view between successive passes through each aor group .",
    "this provided inter - pixel correlation information on both small and large scales .",
    "our observing strategy is therefore very robust against bad rows / columns , large scale cosmetic defects on the array , after - images resulting from saturation due to bright stars , variations in the bias level , and the color dependence of the irac flat - field across the array ( quijada et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "although the four - aor observations of specific areas were performed consecutively , spacecraft visibility constraints meant that coverage of the full ssdf had to be accumulated in separate campaigns spaced roughly six months apart .",
    "these took place in 2011 july - august , 2012 january - february , 2012 july - september , and 2012 december-2013 february . because adjacent regions were inevitably observed at slightly different pas , obvious and irregular coverage gaps were evident between adjacent mapping aor sets as the observations accumulated .",
    "these were covered in the latter two epochs with cluster - mode aors during which the exposures were placed to fill the coverage gaps as smoothly as possible given the spacecraft visibility limits and position angles . like the aors executed earlier ,",
    "these irregular cluster - mode aors were done in sets of single - pass rasters intended to accumulate a total of four dithered 30s exposures everywhere .      to the maximum extent",
    "possible , identical reduction procedures were applied to all ssdf and s - bcs data so as to ensure uniform data quality throughout the field .",
    "the data reduction was based on version s18.18.0 of the irac corrected basic calibrated data ( cbcd ) exposures for the first ssdf campaign ; version s19.1.0 was used for all other , later campaigns .",
    "the cbcd data were used because some of the salient instrument artifacts ( e.g. , multiplexer bleed ) are automatically corrected by the cbcd pipeline .",
    "other artifacts ( e.g. , scattered light ) are flagged in the cbcd pipeline - adjusted pixel masks for each frame .",
    "both features of the cbcd data make them optimal for our purposes .",
    "to remove slowly - decaying residual images from unrelated observations of bright objects , all 3.6 and 4.5@xmath4 m cbcd frames were object - masked and median - stacked on a per - aor basis .",
    "the resulting stacked images ( presumed to represent blank sky ) were visually inspected and subtracted from individual cbcds within each aor .",
    "this created sky - subtracted versions of the cbcds that were free of long - term residual images arising from prior observations of bright sources .",
    "residual images with short decay times arising from observations of bright stars during the ssdf observations themselves were not addressed by this method , however .",
    "pixels flagged as potentially contaminated with such residuals by the irac pipeline were masked .",
    "the sky - subtracted cbcds were then examined individually and processed using custom software routines to correct column - pulldown effects associated with bright sources .",
    "the code , known as the  warm - mission column pulldown corrector , \" is publicly available at the _ spitzer _  science center .",
    "after these preliminaries , the ssdf exposures and the coincident irac imaging from the s - bcs were mosaiced with iracproc ( schuster et al .",
    "iracproc augments the capabilities of the standard irac reduction software ( mopex ) by calculating the spatial derivative for each image pixel and adjusting the clipping algorithm accordingly .",
    "pixels where the derivative is low ( in the field ) are clipped more aggressively than are pixels where the spatial derivative is high ( point sources ) .",
    "this avoids downward biasing of point source fluxes in the output mosaics that might otherwise occur because of the slightly undersampled irac point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the software was configured to automatically flag and reject cosmic ray hits based on pipeline - generated masks together with the adjusted sigma - clipping algorithm for spatially coincident pixels .",
    "the irac mosaics were organized into pairs of coextensive tiles each covering roughly @xmath27deg@xmath0 sub - fields at both 3.6 and 4.5@xmath4 m .",
    "a total of 46 tiles were required to cover the full ssdf . the irac coverage and the tile dimensions and locations",
    "are defined in figure  [ fig : field ] and table  [ tab : tiles ] . by construction ,",
    "the world coordinate systems of all ssdf tile pairs are tied to the coordinates of objects in the two micron all sky survey point source catalog ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , and are in perfect pixel - by - pixel registration .",
    "the resulting 92 final mosaics / coverage map pairs ( one pair per tile per band ) , are publicly available from the exploration science programs webpage at the spitzer science center .",
    "all ssdf mosaics were built with 06 pixels and have units of mjysr@xmath20 .",
    "we detected and photometered sources in the ssdf mosaics with sextractor ( ver .",
    "2.8.6 ; bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "sextractor is well - suited to the relatively sparse ssdf mosaics , where there are numerous source - free pixels available for robust sky background estimation .",
    "we adopted the sextractor parameter settings shown in table  [ tab : settings ] .",
    "the coverage maps constructed by iracproc were used as detection weight images .",
    "custom flag images were constructed to identify and exclude all mosaic pixels covered by fewer than two exposures .",
    "photometry was measured within nine apertures having diameters ranging from 2  to 10  in 1  increments , plus two additional apertures of diameter 15  and 24 , or eleven apertures in all . by comparing photometry measured in the 24  aperture ( i.e. , the aperture adopted by the instrument team as the fiducial photometric aperture for irac ) to that in all other apertures for well - detected , isolated sources , we obtained empirical estimates of the aperture corrections , which are given in table  [ tab : apcorr ] .",
    "we also obtained mag_auto magnitudes , for which sextractor measures fluxes interior to elliptical apertures having sizes and orientations determined using the second - order moments of the light distribution measured above the isophotal threshold .",
    "we compared the mag_auto photometry to the corrected - to - total aperture magnitudes and found that the mag_auto estimates were systematically fainter by roughly 0.05mag .",
    "in other words , the corrected aperture magnitudes are consistent with each other , but the mag_auto measurements are 0.05mag fainter on average .",
    "we used sextractor in dual - image mode . in this configuration , sources are detected , their centers are located , and their apertures are defined in one image , and subsequently photometry is carried out in another image using those pre - established apertures and source centroids .",
    "the dual - image approach forces sextractor to measure the emission from all sources over identical areas in both bands , ensuring that the resulting photometry will yield accurate source colors .",
    "sextractor was configured to define a source as a set of four or more connected pixels each lying 0.5@xmath3 above the estimated background .",
    "we first used the 4.5@xmath4 m mosaics as the detection images ; both the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath4 m mosaics were used in turn as the photometry images .",
    "the process was followed in all 46 tiles covering the ssdf , resulting in 46 pairs of single - band catalogs .",
    "because the source extraction was performed in dual - image mode , the separate 3.6 and 4.5@xmath4 m sextractor catalog pairs generated for each of the two selection bands were in line - by - line registration .",
    "we generated band - merged catalogs by combining photometry from these catalog pairs for all ssdf tiles .",
    "the band - merged , tile - based catalogs were trimmed to exclude overlapping regions at the tile boundaries given in table  [ tab : tiles ] , and all aperture photometry was corrected to total magnitudes using the empirical aperture corrections from table  [ tab : apcorr ] . a full - field catalog covering the entire ssdf",
    "was then created by combining the trimmed , band - berged , aperture - corrected photometry from all tiles .",
    "we chose to include the corrected 4  and 6  diameter aperture magnitudes in the final catalogs , along with the sextractor mag_auto magnitudes .",
    "finally , the above process was repeated using the 3.6@xmath4 m mosaics as the detection images .",
    "the result is a pair of full - field band - merged ssdf catalogs ",
    "one selected at 3.6@xmath4 m , and another selected at 4.5@xmath4 m .",
    "we used a monte carlo approach to estimate the survey completeness and sensitivity by placing numerous simulated sources in the ssdf mosaics at random locations and then photometering them in an identical manner to that used for the original mosaics .",
    "specifically , we inserted simulated objects in both the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath4 m mosaics for five different ssdf tiles ( labeled ssdf1.6 , 2.4 , 2.6 , 3.2 , and 3.5 in figure  [ fig : field ] ) chosen as representative of the range of irac depths of coverage that we obtained . the total area in which the simulated sources were inserted and subsequently photometered therefore",
    "samples roughly 10.6deg@xmath0 of the total survey field .",
    "the simulated sources were randomly assigned magnitudes between 10 and 21vega mag .",
    "hundreds of simulated sources in this range were simultaneously placed at random locations in each of the five tiles employed for this purpose .",
    "the number of simulated sources inserted at one time was restricted to a small percentage of the total number of objects apparent in the field , so as to avoid artificially - induced source confusion effects . nonetheless , because the simulated sources were allowed to fall anywhere in their respective tiles , including atop real sources , the simulations do account realistically for the effects of source confusion .",
    "the process was iterated , so that a total population of 20,000 simulated sources was ultimately analyzed in each of the 0.5mag - wide bins we constructed to span the magnitude range we considered .    after processing the modified mosaics with sextractor in exactly the same way as was done for the original mosaics ,",
    "the resulting catalogs were compared to determine the completeness as a function of magnitude .",
    "the comparison was performed in catalog space with mag_auto magnitudes using a simple position - matching criterion .",
    "an additional constraint was imposed , requiring that a valid detection of a simulated source had to yield a measured magnitude that fell within 0.5mag of its _ a priori _ known magnitude to account for source confusion .",
    "this procedure was repeated in both bands for all five tiles tested .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : comp ] and shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] .",
    "the ssdf catalogs include only sources with aperture - corrected ( total ) magnitudes brighter than the achieved sensitivity levels in at least one of the two ssdf bands .",
    "we defined the ssdf sensitivity as the magnitude at which the empirical uncertainty in the sextractor - estimated fluxes reached approximately the 5@xmath3 level ( 0.2mag ) .",
    "this occurred at [ 3.6]=19.0mag ( 7.0@xmath4jy ) and [ 4.5]=18.2mag ( 9.4@xmath4jy ) for 4  diameter apertures , similar to the sensitivity reported by eisenhardt et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the first irac survey of botes : [ 3.6]=19.1mag and [ 4.5]=18.3mag .",
    "the ssdf thus achieves 5@xmath3 sensitivities similar to those predicted by the online sensitivity performance estimation tool ( sens - pet ) : [ 3.6]=19.2mag and [ 4.5]=18.6mag assuming low background conditions .      to estimate the accuracy of the ssdf astrometry , we compared ssdf irac positions of bright but unsaturated sources to those in the 2mass point source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "we performed a search within 1  of the positions of irac sources to identify their 2mass counterparts .",
    "the distributions of coordinate offsets for the 3.6 and 4.5@xmath4 m sources are shown in figure  [ fig:2mass ] .",
    "the astrometric discrepancies are small compared to the size of a ssdf pixel : the mean difference ( ssdf@xmath22mass ) was just @xmath28 in right ascension and @xmath29 in declination .",
    "the total radial uncertainties are therefore @xmath30 ( 1@xmath3 ) relative to 2mass .",
    "this is about one - fourth of an ssdf mosaic pixel , and less than one - tenth of the full width at half maximum of the irac psf in either band .",
    "this is comparable to the astrometric precision obtained in other _",
    "spitzer_/irac surveys , e.g. , sdwfs ( ashby et al .",

    "the formats of the two catalogs are identical and are defined in table  [ tab : catalog ] .",
    "all aperture magnitudes in both catalogs have been corrected to total magnitudes using the aperture corrections given in table  [ tab : apcorr ] . the catalogs also contain mag_auto total magnitude estimates .",
    "all photometric estimates are provided with 1@xmath3 uncertainty estimates generated by sextractor , and are also given as flux densities in units of @xmath4jy .",
    "in addition to the photometry , the ssdf catalog provides a number of sextractor - derived descriptors for each source as measured in the selection band , 3.6 or 4.5@xmath4 m as appropriate ( table  [ tab : catalog ] ) .",
    "the measured colors of celestial sources reflect their underlying nature , albeit after being folded through the detection / selection process .",
    "the irac colors for all sources listed in the two ssdf catalogs are shown in figure  [ fig : hist ] .",
    "the color distributions are broadly consistent with what is seen typically with irac at these flux levels , e.g. , ashby et al .",
    "for example , the faintest ssdf sources ( those fainter than [ 3.6]=[4.5]=17.5vega mag ) are systematically and significantly redder than brighter ssdf sources .",
    "this is because the surface density of relatively red extragalactic sources increases quickly below 17mag , while the contribution from galactic stars , which are relatively blue in the irac bands , flattens out ( e.g. , fazio et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "the differential irac number counts in the ssdf are given in table  [ tab : counts ] and figure  [ fig : counts ] , after applying appropriate corrections for incompleteness based on the empirical estimates in table  [ tab : comp ] .",
    "although the ssdf catalogs contain many sources brighter than 10mag , these are not shown in the source counts because they are saturated in the irac mosaics .",
    "nonetheless the ssdf counts are broadly consistent with counts measured earlier by , e.g. , ashby et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and fazio et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , over the magnitude range covered by the ssdf catalogs . at bright flux levels ,",
    "the ssdf counts are slightly elevated with respect to sdwfs .",
    "we have examined the ssdf mosaics at the locations of sources in the affected magnitude ranges , and find that virtually all are pointlike .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which these sources are due to milky way stars , seen along a line of sight that is closer in both latitude and longitude ( @xmath33 to the galactic center than is sdwfs ( @xmath34 .",
    "this is borne out by the consistency between the dirbe model milky way star counts and the bright irac ssdf counts shown in figure  [ fig : counts ] .    in the 30s exposures used to construct the ssdf mosaics ,",
