    "the taurus star - formation region ( sfr ) has played a central role in our understanding of low - mass star formation .",
    "the dark molecular clouds in this region of the sky are conspicuously large .",
    "early work classified them as ",
    "nebulae without definite relation to certain stars  @xcite .",
    "the class of very young low - mass variable stars known as t tauri stars ( tts ) is named after the prototype star t tauri @xcite , which is a member of the taurus sfr .",
    "the importance of the taurus sfr is that it contains many nearby tts ( distance @xmath5 140  pc ) in loose aggregations .",
    "the ages of taurus members range from protostars to evolved post t tauri stars , although the bulk of them appears to have emerged from the molecular clouds in the last 4  myr @xcite .",
    "recent surveys in very young clusters have identified a population of substellar objects ( @xmath6@xmath7 ; @xcite ) that appears to be of the same order of magnitude in number as that of stars @xcite .",
    "several brown dwarfs have been identified in sfrs such as the chamaeleon  i sfr @xcite and the trapezium @xcite",
    ". the initial mass function ( imf ) does not appear to change much from one region to another .",
    "taurus is interesting because it represents a loose mode of star formation ( density 110 pc@xmath8 ) , in contrast to that of clusters such as the trapezium ( 10@xmath9 pc@xmath8 ) .",
    "recent searches in taurus by @xcite and @xcite have failed to reveal any candidate members with spectral types later than m6.5v , estimated to be below the substellar limit at the taurus population age @xcite .",
    "@xcite have proposed that the low - mass imf in taurus could be truncated around the substellar limit .",
    "it is indeed important to study whether the imf could be sensitive to the initial conditions of star formation .",
    "in this paper we present the first results of a new effort to search for brown dwarfs in taurus .",
    "we have obtained deeper images over a 5 times larger area than previous work .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of 30 very low - mass ( vlm ) candidate members in the taurus sfr has been carried out .",
    "four candidates are confirmed as vlm objects with spectral types m7 or later , and the probability of membership in the taurus sfr is very high .",
    "they are sufficiently cool to be considered as brown dwarfs .",
    "one of them presents strong evidence for disk accretion .",
    "direct imaging observations of 11 fields in the taurus sfr were obtained with the 3.6-m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) cfh12k camera @xcite between 1999 december and 2000 december .",
    "broad band @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 as well as narrow band h@xmath2 filters were used .",
    "the field of view of cfh12k is 0.327 square degrees .",
    "thus our survey covers a total area of 3.59 square degrees .",
    "a complete description of the survey and associated data reduction will be presented in dougados et al .",
    "( 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "the selection of taurus low - mass candidates presented here is based on a subset of the total cfh12k survey , covering 2.29 square degrees ( 7 fields ) and including @xmath10 and @xmath11 photometry alone .",
    "we selected candidate low - mass taurus members by requiring that they lie 2 magnitudes above the observational zams in the @xmath1 versus @xmath0-@xmath1 color - magnitude diagram ( 20 sources ) .",
    "an additional 10 sources lying closer to the zams with suspected strong h@xmath2 emission from their photometry in the h@xmath2 filter were included in the spectroscopic follow - up sample .",
    "none of the h@xmath2 selected sources turned out to be interesting .",
    "figure  1 shows the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out using isis at the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) in la palma on 2000 september 28 - 29 .",
    "we observed 30 vlm candidates with @xmath1318 .",
    "v410  tau  anon  13 ( m6.5 ; @xcite ) was also observed with the same setup for comparison purposes .",
    "the r158r grating on isis s red arm gave a wavelength coverage from 640.9  nm to 936.5  nm .",
    "the spectral resolution was 2.5 pixel ( 7.2    ) .",
    "the data were reduced using standard routines for bias - subtraction and flat - field correction within the iraf enviroment .",
    "wavelength calibration was made using the spectrum of a near lamp .",
    "instrumental response was calibrated out using spectra of the flux standard feige 24 .",
    "this paper focuses on the four new vlm candidates for which our wht spectra give spectral types m7 or later ( figure  2 ) .",
    "these objects represent an extension of the previously known taurus members to lower masses , beyond the substellar limit . some of the remaining 26 candidates have h@xmath14 emission and spectral types earlier than m7",
    ". they could be taurus sfr members .",
    "we defer presentation of these stars to another paper ( dougados et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "spectral types were obtained by measuring the strength of vo absorption using indexes defined by @xcite calibrated with spectra of field ultracool dwarfs .",
    "we obtain a spectral type for v410  tau  anon  13 of m6 , consistent within the uncertainties ( half a subclass ) with the m6.5 estimate of @xcite .",
    "near - infrared photometry for the program objects was extracted from the 2mass second incremental data release point source catalog .",
    "line - of - sight extinction was measured using the @xmath15 colors of field m dwarfs and the interstellar extinction law of @xcite .",
    "the astrometric , photometric and spectroscopic information for these sources is summarized in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "we obtained near - infrared spectra for two of these objects using the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; @xcite ) at the cassegrain focus of the 8-m subaru telescope on 2001 january 9 .",
    "the @xmath16-band grism gave a wavelength coverage from 1.93 to 2.48  @xmath17 m , a dispersion of 6.1  a  pix@xmath18 and a resolution of 350 at 2.2  @xmath17 m .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf routines for bias - subtraction , flat - field correction and sky - subtraction .",
    "telluric bands were cancelled using the spectrum of the g3 star sao  167029 .",
    "the photospheric br@xmath3 line in sao  167029 was removed by interpolation between adjacent continuum points .",
    "the spectra of the targets were multiplied by a blackbody with t@xmath19=5785  k , adequate for the g3 spectral type of the standard star @xcite .",
    "the final ircs spectra are shown in figure  3 .",
    "brown dwarfs in the taurus sfr should be in a very early phase of gravitational contraction .",
    "theoretical models indicate that their gravities are between 10 to 100 times lower than for vlm stars at the bottom of the main sequence @xcite .",
    "collisionally dominated photospheric lines are thus very good tracers of low gravity atmospheres and can be used as a strong criterion to distinguish young bds from old vlm stars .",
    "@xcite noted that and lines were much weaker in the m6 taurus star v410  x - ray  3 than among field m6 dwarfs .",
    "we find that our four new taurus vlm objects also have weaker and lines than field dwarfs of the same spectral type ( figures 2 and 3 ) .    a spectral type of m6.5 is considered the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs for the pleiades cluster age , i.e. 120  myr . for younger ages ,",
    "the boundary should stay at m6.5 or move to slightly earlier spectral type @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that the four objects presented in this letter are very likely substellar members in the taurus sfr because they have spectral types m7 or later and low - gravity indications in their spectra . prior to this work , the coolest known taurus member was gg  tau  bb , the faintest member of the gg  tau quadruple system . @xcite estimated an age of 1.5  myr and a mass of 0.04  @xmath7for it .",
    "gg  tau  bb has spectral type m7 , @xmath16=12.01 and a@xmath20 0 .",
    "two of our objects , namely cfht - bd - tau  2 and 3 , are intrinsically fainter than gg  tau  bb . using the models of @xcite , which provide the best isochrone fitting to the gg  tau quadruple system , we obtain ages of about 1  myr , and masses of about 0.03  @xmath7for both cfht - bd - tau  2 and 3 .",
    "cfht - bd - tau  1 and 4 appear to be more luminous than the 1  myr isochrone .",
    "dougados et al .",
    "( 2001 , in preparation ) will present a detailed discussion of the position of these objects in the h - r diagram .",
    "our ircs data allows us to search for br@xmath3 in emission , which has been detected in classical ttss @xcite .",
    "these authors found a correlation between the strength of br@xmath3 emission and the accretion rate estimated from @xmath21-band excess and blue excess spectra of ttss .",
    "we find br@xmath3 emission in cfht - bd - tau  4 ( figure  3 ) , which also displays the strongest h@xmath2 emission in our sample ( table  2 ) .",
    "the analogy with the ttss suggest that cfht - bd - tau  4 may be accreting matter from a circumstellar disk .",
    "v410  tau  anon  13 is a vlm taurus member with h@xmath2 emission ( ew(h@xmath2)=-41.3   ; @xcite ) .",
    "we measured a similar strength of h@xmath2 emission ( ew(h@xmath2)=-35   ) in our wht spectrum .",
    "our br@xmath3 detection for v410  tau  anon  13 confirms that this object may be accreting matter as previously proposed by @xcite from a high - resolution study of the h@xmath2 line profile .",
    "the continuum of the ircs spectra of cfht - bd - tau  4 and v410  tau  anon  13 are significantly redder and the co bands are shallower than in the comparison spectrum of lhs 3003 , contrarily to what one would expect from the sensitivity of these bands to the surface gravity",
    ". this could be due to emission from the circumstellar disk , which could add a red continuum and could veil the co features .",
    "cfht - bd - tau  4 is located close to the tau  iii group identified by @xcite .",
    "cfht - bd - tau  1 , 2 and 3 could be associated with group v , for which only half a dozen members were known so far .",
    "group v has much fewer known t tauri members than groups ii and iii .",
    "we note that three out of four of our new bds are located in a sparsely populated group , and none in one of the richer groups i , ii and iii , which were included in the photometric survey",
    ". the spatial distribution of bds in taurus may give an important clue to the dominant formation mechanism of these objects .",
    "our results are intriguing because they suggest that the density of bds in the taurus sfr may be anticorrelated with the density of ttss .",
    "@xcite found an isolated group of vlm young stars at high galactic latitude and suggested that vlm stars and brown dwarfs may form in small groups without any low - mass star .",
    "a mass segregation in taurus would explain the lack of brown dwarfs in the searches carried out by @xcite and @xcite , which were limited to the dense groups of ttss .",
    "but why is there a lack of bds in dense groups of ttss in the taurus sfr ?",
    "a possible answer may be that in rich groups bds get ejected at a very early stage @xcite and disperse away from the molecular clouds in a short time .",
    "the binary frequency of ttss in the taurus sfr is higher than in other sfrs @xcite , such as the trapezium @xcite , implying that the ejection mechanism may be more efficient in taurus .",
    "fully resolving this issue will however require studying a larger sample of taurus bds , which the completion of the cfh12k survey should soon provide .",
    "the william herschel telescope is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
