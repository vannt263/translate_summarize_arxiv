    "most nearby , large elliptical galaxies should host a massive black hole left over from an earlier quasar phase ( fabian & canizares 1988 ; fabian & rees 1995 ) .",
    "giant elliptical galaxies also contain an extensive hot halo which provides a minimum fuelling level for accretion .",
    "this leads to a problem .",
    "fabian & canizares ( 1988 ) have determined a limit to the accretion rate for a sample of bright elliptical galaxies produced using the classical bondi ( 1952 ) formula .",
    "they concluded that if the radiative efficiency of accretion is @xmath1 per cent , then all such nuclei would appear much more luminous than observed .",
    "the limits on the luminosity of the galaxies mean that black holes masses are of at most a few times @xmath2 contradicting quasar counts and integrated luminosities which imply black hole masses above @xmath3  @xmath4 .",
    "low - luminosity radio activity is very common in ellipticals ( sadler , jenkins & kotanij 1989 ; wrobel 1991 , slee et al .",
    "1994 ) indicating that indeed there is some kind of central engine in the cores of these galaxies .",
    "the inconsistencies described above , can be reconciled by considering a situation in which the intrinsic radiative efficiency of the accretion is low .",
    "this has been noted by fabian & rees ( 1995 ) in the light of recent discussions of optically thin advection - dominated accretion solutions ( narayan & yi 1995a , b ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 , narayan , mahadevan & yi 1995 and references therein ) . in this mode of accretion ,",
    "the accretion rate , @xmath5 , is low , the ions remain at the virial temperature and the radiative efficiency of the low density accreting material can be very small .",
    "the energy released by viscous friction is advected into the black hole .",
    "accretion of hot gas in an elliptical galaxy may create the ideal circumstances for a hot ion torus to form ( begelman 1986 ) and thus an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) to operate .",
    "in particular the successful application of low efficiency accretion via an adaf in the giant elliptical galaxy m87 ( which contains a @xmath6 black hole ",
    "ford et al .",
    "1995 ; harms et al .",
    "1995 ) by reynolds et al .",
    "( 1997 ; paper i ) suggests that such mechanisms can be of wide importance .",
    "there , we found that the luminosity of m87 is consistent with the observations only if bondi accretion from the hot gas involves an adaf .",
    "x - ray observations provide us with core gas densities and therefore the means for estimating the bondi accretion rate .    here",
    "we present another example of a giant elliptical galaxy , m60 ( ngc 4649 ) , in which we believe accretion could be taking place via an adaf .",
    "the giant elliptical galaxy m60 ( ngc 4649 ) is an optically luminous galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "it possesses very weak jets and small radio lobes indicating an active nucleus .",
    "the radio spectrum of the nucleus is weakly inverted ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1987 ) as expected from an adaf .",
    "a deprojection analysis of data from the _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) shows that the interstellar medium ( ism ) in m60 has a central density @xmath7 for a sound speed @xmath8 ( c.  b.  peres , private communication ) .",
    "the resulting bondi accretion rate onto the central black hole is then @xmath9 if we assume a black hole mass of @xmath10 and a radiative efficiency of @xmath11 , the bondi rate for a radiative efficiency of @xmath11 predicts a luminosity of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "we show here that the luminosity of the core of m60 does not exceed @xmath13 and is probably less than @xmath14 over all energies .    in this _ letter _",
    "we present a detailed examination of the possibility that the massive black hole in m60 accretes via an adaf .",
    "in particular , we compute the spectrum expected and show that it is consistent with observations for a likely black hole mass ( @xmath15 ) and reasonable mass accretion rates given by eqn.(1 ) .",
    "in contrast to m87 ( paper i ) the observations of m60 are not highly contaminated by jet emission and therefore provide tighter constraints on the model spectrum .    in section 2 we compile data from the literature on the full - band spectrum of the core of m60 and present some additional data on the x - ray flux from the core .",
    "section 3 describes some details of our adaf model spectrum calculation . in section 4 ,",
    "we compare the model spectrum with the data and find that accretion rates comparable with the bondi rate allow a black mass of @xmath0 at least .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to examine the nature of the accretion flow in m60 , we have compiled the best observational limits on the full band spectrum of the core emission .",
    "our aim is to obtain good observational limits on the core flux over a wide range of frequencies rather than to compile a comprehensive list of all previous observations .",
    "some contribution from the weak jets and in particular from the underlying galaxy are unavoidable and so the derived spectrum should be considered an upper limit to that of the accretion flow at the core of m60 .",
    "the data are summarized in table  1 .",
    "very large array ( vla ) imaging by stanger & warwick ( 1986 ) and wrobel & heeshen ( 1991 ) shows an extended radio source dominated by a compact ( @xmath16 4 arc ",
    "sec ) core .",
    "the extended structure defines radio lobes powered by weak jets with linear dimensions @xmath17 .",
    "the slowly - rising spectral nature of the high - frequency emission is well defined by the data of fabbiano et al .",
    "( 1987 ) obtained from the 100 m radio telescope of the mpifr at bonn .",
    "_ einstein _ observations of m60 reveal that the overall x - ray emission is extended with most of it arising from the hot gas at @xmath18 ( stanger and warwick 1986 ) .",
    "we have examined the _",
    "rosat hri _ dataset in order to constrain the nuclear x - ray flux of m60 . here",
    "we present the _ rosat _",
    "hri data resulting from a 19923s exposure performed on 1995 june 21 . fig .",
    "1 shows the _ rosat _ hri image of m60 .",
    "consistently with the _ einstein _ hri observation , the _ rosat _ hri image shows that m60 is extended x - ray source with most of the emission coming from hot gas in the interstellar medium .",
    "the low luminosity radio activity though , indicates that there is some form of active central engine in the core of m60 . in order to find an upper limit to the nuclear emission of m60 , we have considered an extended component modelled by a king profile plus a point source modelled by the psf of the hri ( see fig.2 ) . our upper limit ( at 90 per cent confidence ) predicts a count rate from the point source component of @xmath19cts@xmath20 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . assuming the spectrum to be a power - law with a canonical photon index @xmath21 modified by the effects of galactic absorption ( with column density @xmath22 ) ; this count rate implies a flux density at 1kev of @xmath23 .",
    "this result is fairly insensitive to the choice of power - law index .",
    "it has been found ( rees 1982 ; narayan & yi 1995ab ; abramovicz et al .",
    "1995 ) that the advection dominated solution can occur only at accretion rates below @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity prescription and @xmath26 corresponds to the standard eddington accretion rate . at such low accretion rate the cooling timescale for the ions exceeds the inflow timescale and most of the thermal energy",
    "is carried into the event horizon .",
    "the plasma is much hotter than in the classical , radiatively  efficient , thin disk solution and the flow consists of a thick torus .",
    "we assume that electrons and protons are coupled only by two  body coulomb interactions and that electrons radiate by synchro - cyclotron , bremsstrahlung and inverse compton processes .",
    "since the coulomb coupling is very weak , the ions remain at the virial temperature and very little energy is transferred to the electrons .",
    "the disk , in this solution , has low radiative efficiency .    for convenience , we rescale the radial co - ordinate and define @xmath27 by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the radial coordinate and @xmath30 is the schwarzschild radius of the hole and the accretion rate , @xmath31 the adaf model , which is based on that of narayan & yi ( 1995 ) is the same as that used in paper i for m87 ( reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) . by assuming that the system is undergoing advection - dominated accretion",
    ", we can predict the radio  to  x - ray spectrum of the accretion flow .",
    "the amount of emission from the different processes and the shape of the spectrum can be determined as a function of the model variables : the viscosity parameter , @xmath25 , the ratio of magnetic to total pressure , @xmath32 , the mass of the central black hole , @xmath33 , and the accretion rate , @xmath34 . for the moment",
    ", we take @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( i.e. magnetic pressure in equipartition with gas pressure ) . the electron temperature at a given point in the adaf , @xmath37 , can then be determined self - consistently for a given @xmath34 and @xmath33 by balancing the heating of the electrons by the ions against the various radiative cooling mechanisms ( within @xmath38 , it is found that @xmath37 is approximately constant in the range of parameter space of interest and it is @xmath39 ) . to determine the observed spectrum",
    ", we integrate the emission over the volume and take account of self - absorption effects .",
    "we have taken the inner radius of the disk to correspond with the innermost stable orbit around a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath40 , and the outer radius to be @xmath41 ( for which the characteristic 2-temperature adaf solution is mantained ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the spectrum of the advection - dominated disk for @xmath42 where @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 and @xmath45 given by the bondi accretion rate in eqn .",
    "the peak in the radio band is due to synchro - cyclotron emission by the electrons in the magnetic field of the plasma .",
    "the x - ray peak is due to thermal bremsstrahlung . the power - law emission extending through the optical band",
    "is due to comptonization of the synchro - cyclotron emission : more detailed calculations show this emission to be composed of individual peaks corresponding to different orders of compton scattering .",
    "the positions at which the synchrotron and bremsstrahlung peaks occur and their relative heights depend on the parameters of the model .",
    "the synchrotron radiation is self - absorbed and locally gives a rayleigh jeans spectrum , up to a critical frequency , @xmath46 .",
    "the bremsstrahlung peak occurs at the thermal frequency @xmath47 .",
    "3 shows the data on m60 with predicted spectra for different black hole masses and the relative bondi accretion rates .",
    "a strong feature of an advection  dominated solution is that the whole spectrum can be determined by few parameters . with",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath32 given the only two parameters left are @xmath43 and @xmath34 .",
    "in paper i we had an independent determination for the black hole mass , @xmath43 , of m87 .",
    "the only parameter to be determined was therefore the accretion rate .",
    "a comparison with the observational limits confirmed that the physically consistent accretion rate for such a system was indeed the bondi rate .",
    "here we therefore use the bondi formula and vary the mass @xmath43 .",
    "we find that the radio bounds on fig .",
    "3 allow black hole masses @xmath48 , similar to that required by independent arguments for dead quasars . for such masses ,",
    "the low luminosity of the core of m60 is consistent with the data at different wavelengths only if the accretion involves an adaf .",
    "interestingly , the radio data points reproduce the slope ( @xmath49 ) of the self - absorbed synchrotron radiation ( mahadevan 1996 ) very well .",
    "such agreement is even more evident than in m87 ( paper i ) where contributions from the powerful jet had to be taken into account .",
    "it is important to point out that radio observations ( slee et al . 1994 ) of many bright elliptical galaxies typically show rising spectra with an average radio spectral index of @xmath50 .    .",
    "we have shown that if m60 consists of an advection - dominated system accreting from the hot interstellar medium at a rate determined by the bondi formula , then the upper limit on nuclear black hole mass is much higher , @xmath51 , than that determined by fabian & canizares ( 1988 ) , @xmath52few@xmath53 .",
    "the poor efficiency of this advective accretion mode accounts for the low luminosity observed and allows for black hole masses of the order of @xmath4 consistent with the idea that bright ellipticals like m60 , host dead quasars .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by the previous application of a similar model to the well known active nucleus in m87 , which has a nuclear black hole mass of @xmath54 and luminosity several orders of magnitude fainter than that expected from the bondi solution ( paper i ) .    an important test for this model would be high frequency radio / submm observations .",
    "these should reveal an abrupt spectral turnover above the inner self - absorbed frequency ( @xmath55 ) predicted by the model .",
    "observations of the turnover would constrain the allowable viscosity and magnetic parameters @xmath25 and @xmath32 . fig .",
    "4 illustrates how different combinations of @xmath25 and @xmath32 are either ruled out by the available data or constrained by the higher frequency observations . in particular , we suggest that @xmath25 and @xmath32 should be anticorrelated for a given mass in order to have agreement with observations .",
    "this means that for relatively low values of @xmath25 ( @xmath56 within the context of adaf ) require magnetic fields below their equipartition value ( i.e. @xmath57 ) , for a black hole mass @xmath58 .",
    "high radio frequency polarization and interferometry studies could indicate and resolve the torus perpendicular to the jet .",
    "better constraints on the x - ray flux will only be obtained with the improved resolution of axaf .",
