    "the production of hot , highly - ionized gas in galactic environments is closely related to the input of energy and matter from stars and supernovae into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "such `` feedback '' can shape the ism on kiloparsec scales in regions with high concentrations of early - type stars . in disk galaxies , with differing pressure gradients in the vertical and radial directions , such energy input is responsible for the production of vertically - extended `` halos '' or `` coronae '' about these systems @xcite .",
    "howk et al .",
    "@xcite have recently completed a study of interstellar o  vi  in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . because the ionization energy required for its creation ( ip@xmath5 ev ) precludes its production via photoionization by starlight , o  vi  is a tracer of hot ( @xmath6 k ) , collisionally - ionized gas in galactic environments .",
    "therefore , the howk et al .",
    "study of o  vi  in the lmc provides fundamental information on the content , distribution , and kinematics of material created by the interactions of stars and supernovae with the ism in the closest and best - studied disk galaxy beyond the milky way .",
    "i summarize the principle results of this study below .",
    "table 1 summarizes the statistical properties of the o  vi  column densities , @xmath7 , along the 12 sight lines in the howk et al .",
    "@xcite study , while figure [ fig : maps ] compares the distribution of lmc o  vi  with h@xmath8@xcite and _ rosat _  hard x - ray @xcite views of the lmc .",
    "significant o  vi  is observed across the whole face of the lmc , although the o  vi  is patchy : the standard deviation of the measurements is @xmath9 of the mean .",
    "sight lines projected onto known superbubbles ( the four sight lines south of @xmath10 in figure [ fig : maps ] ) show only very modest ( if any ) o  vienhancements compared with more quiescent - appearing sight lines ( e.g. , nos .",
    "14 in figure [ fig : maps ] ) .",
    "ll +   + & + @xmath11 & @xmath12 @xmath13 + @xmath14 $ ] & @xmath15 @xmath13 + @xmath16 & @xmath17 @xmath13 +    for comparison with the milky way values reported by savage et al .",
    "@xcite , we define the quantity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the inclination of the lmc . this is the column density projected perpendicular to the plane of the lmc and is equivalent to the @xmath20 measurements in the galaxy",
    ". the first _ fuse _  measurements of galactic halo o  vi  towards extragalactic objects found @xmath21 ( @xmath9 standard deviation ) . the average lmc and milky way @xmath22 values  and their standard deviations  are identical .",
    "the observed kinematic profiles of the lmc o  vi  are quite broad , with breadths implying @xmath23 k. figure [ fig : profiles ] shows the normalized o  vi  absorption profiles along the 12 sight lines studied and the profiles of a moderate - strength fe  ii  transition .",
    "the latter traces gas associated with neutral material in the lmc disk .",
    "the o  vi  is much broader than the fe  ii  along all sight lines and is systematically blue - shifted from the disk ( by @xmath24 km  s@xmath2  on average ) .",
    "thus , the o  vi  is kinematically decoupled from the bulk of the lmc disk material .",
    "there is gas present at velocities compatible with the outflow of material from the lmc disk along all of the sight lines discussed by howk et al . in only two cases",
    "is there possibly o  vi  at velocities that may indicate infall .",
    "the _ fuse _  observations reveal interstellar o  vi  associated with the lmc is present in large quantities across the whole face of the lmc , with an average column density and patchiness identical to those of the galactic halo .",
    "lines of sight projected onto superbubbles and supergiant shells have much the same column densities as lines of sight projected onto quiescent regions .",
    "the lmc o  vi  absorption is both much broader and shifted to lower absolute velocities than the lower - ionization gas ( e.g. , fe  ii ) .    for reasons discussed in detail by howk et al .",
    "@xcite , the favored interpretation of these salient aspects of the lmc o  vi  is that the lmc is surrounded by a hot , highly - ionized halo or corona  similar in many respects to that found in the milky way  that gives rise to the observed o  vi  absorption .",
    "several models can explain the physics of the o  vi  production within a gaseous halo about the lmc , including cooling galactic fountain flows and interface models ( such as turbulent mixing layer or conductive interface models ) .",
    "the cooling fountain model provides an elegant explanation for the similarity of the average milky way and lmc o  vi  column densities .",
    "though these galaxies differ in oxygen abundance by a factor of @xmath0 , the column density of highly - ionized metals in a cooling flow of hot material is independent of abundance @xcite .",
    "the column density of o  vi  in the edgar & chevalier @xcite models is a function of the ratio @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cooling rate ( in protons @xmath13",
    "s@xmath2 ) , and @xmath27 is the initial density of the flow .",
    "the average lmc o  vi  column density ( table 1 ) corresponds to a one - sided mass - flow rate from the lmc disk of @xmath28 the adopted density is consistent with estimates of electron densities in supergiant shells and diffuse gas using x - ray observations of the lmc @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the energy input requirements into the ism and mass flow rates from the disk can be significantly different if the o  vi  arises in turbulent mixing layers or other interface - type models .",
    "observations of other highly - ionized species ( e.g. , c  iv ) will be required to distinguish between the cooling flow and interface models .",
