    "the most widely accepted ejection mechanism , proposed by @xcite , involves the encounter of a close binary with a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "other possible mechanisms ejecting stars from the galactic center involve intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , or a cluster of stellar mass black holes around the smbh @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that the rotational velocities of hvss should be lower than those measured for single stars of the same spectral type if they originated in binaries , because of tidal effects .",
    "he predicted that the rotational velocities of the known b - type hvss should be @xmath2 km  s@xmath1 , based on values compiled by @xcite for b - stars in binaries .",
    "@xcite predicted high rotational velocities for hvss that were ejected by a very close encounter with an imbh in the galactic center , however such encounters are very unlikely .",
    "these predictions can not be tested with existing observations , as the low resolution of the discovery spectra of most hvss is not sufficient to determine projected rotational velocities ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the only hvs with high resolution spectroscopy and a @xmath3 measurement is he 04375439 , found by @xcite .",
    "it has @xmath4  km  s@xmath1 @xcite , in agreement with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite measured half - solar metallicity for this early b - star , establishing its origin in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the possible ejection mechanisms for this star include an interaction with an imbh or a smbh , and a dynamical interaction of a single star in a dense cluster .",
    "this example demonstrates the importance of high resolution spectroscopy for understanding this newly discovered class of objects .    of the remaining hvss , hvs2 ( or us708 ;",
    "* ) , is classified as an evolved sdo star and reasonably well understood . however there is some ambiguity in the nature of the late b - type hvss , since at their temperatures and gravities , the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) crosses the main sequence .",
    "hot bhb stars generally have low rotational velocities and peculiar chemical abundances @xcite , thus high resolution spectroscopy of these faint hvss can determine their nature by measuring their atmospheric parameters , chemical abundances and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , time series photometry can reveal pulsations and confirm their main sequence nature , as was done for hvs1 by @xcite .",
    "motivated by the lack of @xmath3 and stellar parameter measurements for most of the known hvss and the possibility of testing the nature of the smbh in the center of our galaxy , we performed high resolution spectroscopy of two hvss . in this letter",
    "we present our results .",
    "we collected spectra of hvs7 and hvs8 ( sdss j113312.12@xmath5010824.9 and j094214.04@xmath5200322.1 ) with the blue chip of the mike spectrograph @xcite installed at the 6.5-m magellan clay telescope at las campanas observatory ( chile ) , on two half nights on ut 2008 january 1819 .",
    "each star was observed twice , with individual exposure times between 900 and @xmath6 , using a @xmath7 slit and 3@xmath83 binning .",
    "the total exposure times were @xmath9 for hvs7 and @xmath10 for hvs8 .",
    "the resolution of the spectra is r = 32,000 at 4500  .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the mike reduction pipeline @xcite .",
    "the extracted spectra for each star were then averaged , normalized and merged .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the merged spectra is 3900 - 5050  , with an average s / n - ratio per pixel of 15 for hvs7 and 14 for hvs8 , based on the extracted continuum around 4500  .",
    "these s / n - ratios and our spectral resolution are sufficient to distinguish between high ( @xmath11 km  s@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and low ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath3 values for b - stars .",
    "next , we corrected the wavelength scale for doppler shift , to allow comparison of the spectra with models ( see  3 ) .",
    "we measured the heliocentric radial velocity of each star using the iraf cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite and the grid of models described in  3 .",
    "table  [ tab : rv ] lists our results and the values previously reported by @xcite .",
    " 4 discusses the implications of our new radial velocity measurements .",
    "our high resolution spectra allow direct determination of the effective temperature @xmath13 , surface gravity @xmath14 , and @xmath3 of the stars by comparing synthetic model spectra to the observations .",
    "the s / n - ratio of the data is however too low to reliably measure abundances .",
    "we generated a grid of synthetic spectra using the lte atlas9 models and opacities developed by @xcite .",
    "the grid covers @xmath13 between 800015000  k in steps of 1000  k , and @xmath14 between 3.05.0 in steps of 0.25 dex .",
    "the metallicity was set to solar , assuming that the hvss are ejected from the galactic center , where abundances are solar or supersolar @xcite .",
    "for the macro- and micro - turbulence velocities we adopted 0 and 2 km  s@xmath1 , which are typical for late b - stars @xcite .",
    "the models were broadened by 0.15    to match mike s instrumental profile and resampled to a dispersion of 0.03  / pix to match the dispersion of the stellar spectra . finally , we convolved each model with rotational profiles between 10350 km  s@xmath1 in 10 km  s@xmath1 velocity increments .",
    "simultaneous fits to @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath3 were performed for each star by iteratively comparing each model to the data .",
    "the agreement between each model and the observed spectra is quantified by the spectroscopic quality - of - fit parameter , @xmath16 ( normalized @xmath17 ) , defined by @xcite and given by the equation @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the number of points in the spectrum , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the root mean squared deviation between each model and the stellar spectrum , and the smallest value of the rms found .",
    "@xmath16 = 0 gives the best model fit , and @xmath16 = 1 defines the statistical 1@xmath22 confidence interval of the result .",
    "the following subsections describe the derivation of @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath3 for each target .",
    "the spectrum of hvs7 ( v=17.80 mag , s / n=15 ) includes four balmer lines ( @xmath23  @xmath24 ) from which @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 can be estimated .",
    "we also detect , , and lines that can in principle be used to further constrain @xmath13 and @xmath3 , however the two main @xmath13 indicators ( and ) have anomalous line strengths and can not be used to constrain the @xmath13 .",
    "we are therefore left with only the balmer lines that are simultaneously sensitive to @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 , but can still provide non - degenerate values of these parameters for late b - type stars ( see  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "we performed two tests to verify that balmer lines alone are sufficient to simultaneously derive the three parameters : a ) we applied our analysis to synthetic spectra with added random noise matching the s / n - ratios of the observations , and in all cases recovered the input values within errors , b ) we applied our analysis to a high s / n spectrum of a late b - type star ( hr7447 , b5 iii ) , kindly provided by l. lyubimkov .",
    "our analysis yielded @xmath13 = 14,000 @xmath0 1000 k , @xmath14 = 3.75 @xmath0 0.25 dex , and @xmath3 = 70 @xmath0 20 km  s@xmath1 , in agreement with the parameters derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath13 = 13,400 k , @xmath14 = 3.64 dex , @xmath3 = 76 km  s@xmath1 )",
    ".    we then proceeded to fit the spectrum of hvs7 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 .",
    "we performed several tests to determine the stability of the best fit solutions .",
    "we ran fits to the entire spectrum , 100     windows centered on each balmer line ( to ensure that the wings and some continuum are included ) , portions of the spectrum outside the balmer lines , and 1020     windows centered on metal lines . in the last two cases we had to fix @xmath13 and @xmath14 to the values from the fits to the entire spectrum and the balmer lines and only fit for @xmath3 . all the tests give fully consistent results , with the following best fit parameters : @xmath13 = 12,000 @xmath0 1000 k , @xmath14 = 3.50 @xmath0 0.25 dex , and @xmath3 = 60 @xmath0 17 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath16 minimization results for the full spectrum are shown in figure [ fig : conts ] .",
    "we have adopted conservative errors for @xmath13 and @xmath14 equal to the grid step size , versus their smaller 1@xmath22 statistical errors .",
    "the statistical 1@xmath22 errors for @xmath3 ( horizontal dotted line in the @xmath16 vs. @xmath3 plot in figure [ fig : conts ] ) , are @xmath25 and @xmath26 km  s@xmath1 , however visual comparison of the models to the observed spectrum show they are too large .",
    "instead we adopted the errors resulting from the fits to individual metal lines .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig : hlines ] compares the best fit model to the balmer lines of hvs7 .",
    "figure [ fig : metals ] shows metal lines detected in hvs7 with @xmath3 = 40 , 60 , and 80 km  s@xmath1 models overplotted .",
    "the purpose of this plot is two - fold ; the left - side panels show how the k and @xmath274233 lines ( @xmath3 is derived from these two and the @xmath284549 and 4583 lines ) give @xmath3 = 60 km  s@xmath1 as the best model fit , and their depths agree with the solar abundance adopted in the models .",
    "the @xmath3 from these lines also agrees with the fits to the full spectrum and the balmer lines .",
    "the right - side panels show the behavior of the doublet , the and lines .",
    "none of the models in the grid can reproduce the depths of those lines . while and seem depleted in the atmosphere of hvs7 ,",
    "the 4128/4130 lines seem strongly enhanced .",
    "the models can not reproduce either the depth nor the line strength ratio of the and lines .",
    "the enhancement of the 4128/4130 doublet is even more significant when taking into account that the kurucz lte atlas9 models overpredict the strengths of these lines .",
    "this problem persists even after including non - lte corrections @xcite .",
    "abundance peculiarities have been noticed before in bhb stars by several authors @xcite ; however , most of these are very slow rotators ( @xmath29 km  s@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectrum of hvs8 ( v=18.09 mag , s / n = 14 ) has a s / n similar to the hvs7 spectrum , however , inspection of the spectrum of hvs8 for metal lines gives null results .",
    "this can be explained by very low metal abundances , strong depletion , or highly broadened metal lines .",
    "the @xmath3 obtained below points towards the latter case .",
    "to derive @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 we used only the spectrum above 4000    because of problems with the continuum normalization at shorter wavelengths .",
    "as with hvs7 , we simultaneously fit for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath3 by iteratively comparing the spectrum of hvs8 to our model grid .",
    "we ran fits to the entire spectrum and 160     windows centered on the balmer lines , which gave consistent parameters : @xmath13 = 11,000 @xmath0 1000 k , @xmath14 = 3.75 @xmath0 0.25 dex , and @xmath3 = 260 @xmath0 70 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the lack of metal lines in the spectrum of hvs8 is consistent with a high @xmath3 that results in strong line broadening .",
    "the error in @xmath3 in this case comes directly from the @xmath16 = 1 statistical 1@xmath22 result , as visual comparison of the spectrum to the models does not allow us to place a finer constraint .",
    "the right - side panel in figure [ fig : hlines ] compares the best fit model to the @xmath23 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 lines of hvs8 .",
    "the flat - bottomed cores of the balmer lines , which are the most sensitive regions to @xmath3 , clearly illustrate that hvs8 rotates faster than hvs7 .",
    "the new radial velocity observations in table [ tab : rv ] provide a third epoch for each star and allow to check for variations .",
    "our radial velocity measurement for hvs7 is identical to the values reported by @xcite and @xcite , within errors .",
    "such measurements provide clues to the nature of hvss . as pointed out by brown et al .",
    ", determining the nature of late b - type hvss is not straightforward because late - type main sequence b - stars and hot blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars have identical atmospheric parameters .",
    "bhb stars are less luminous and therefore closer in distance to us .",
    "establishing the evolutionary stage of hvs7 is critical because its radial velocity is marginally consistent with it being a bhb runaway star bound to our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the lack of significant radial velocity variations for hvs7 suggests it is not a binary , nor a pulsator . slowly pulsating main sequence b",
    "- type stars typically show radial velocity variations of @xmath32 20  km  s@xmath1 in amplitude @xcite , while bhb stars appear to be stable , as they fall outside the rr lyrae instability strip @xcite . the long term radial velocity stability of hvs7 , combined with the metal abundance anomalies ( see  [ sec : hvs7 ] ) , hint towards hvs7 being a bhb star .",
    "its @xmath3 ( 60@xmath33 km  s@xmath1 ) is higher than typically found for bhb stars ( @xmath29 km  s@xmath1 ) , although rotators with @xmath3 up to @xmath34 km  s@xmath1 have been observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the true nature of hvs7 as a bound bhb star will have to be disentangled by astrometry .    for hvs8",
    "we detect a radial velocity variation of 23 km  s@xmath1 , consistent with a pulsating main sequence b - type star .",
    "we can not discard the possibility of hvs8 being a binary , although the system would have a very low mass - ratio , since there is no evidence of lines from a companion in the spectrum .",
    "the star is most likely a main sequence slow pulsator , like hvs1 @xcite .",
    "the low s / n of our spectrum does not allow to test for metal abundance anomalies in hvs8 , however , the high rotational velocity of this star will make its abundance analysis difficult , even with higher s / n spectra .",
    "we have derived @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for hvs7 and hvs8 , two of the ten currenty known hvss .",
    "their @xmath13 and @xmath14 are consistent with the stars being late b - type , as initially classified by @xcite using photometric color indexes .",
    "hvs7 has a projected rotational velocity @xmath3 = @xmath35 km  s@xmath1 , while for hvs8 @xmath3 = @xmath36 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "these measurements provide the first direct observational test to the prediction by @xcite , who suggests that hvss ejected via hills mechanism should rotate systematically slower ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath1 ) than single stars of the same spectral type ( @xmath37 km  s@xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the hvss have fast rotational velocities typical of single b - type stars in the field , other ejection mechanisms , such as three - body encounters of single stars with @xmath32 @xmath38@xmath39 @xmath40 imbhs , with a binary mbh , or with @xmath32 10 @xmath40 stellar - mass black holes orbiting the galactic smbh , have to be invoked .",

    ". if the inclination of the rotation axis of hvs7 is low , its rotational velocity could in principle be much higher . in that case both targets are inconsistent with hansen s prediction for hills scenario .",

    "statistical tests performed by @xcite conclude that a sample of 25 or more hvss will be needed to distinguish between scenarios at a @xmath41 95@xmath42 confidence level .",
