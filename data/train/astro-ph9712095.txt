    "one of the important problems in cosmology is the origin of galaxies , clusters , and structures seen on huge scales in the spatial distribution of galaxies and in the microwave background radiation . given some initial seed fluctuations we would like to be able to make analytic predictions to describe the gravitational clustering that generates the large - scale structure that we see today .",
    "the probability distribution function contains all the statistical information concerning the cosmic fields : density @xmath3 and velocity @xmath4 fluctuations . here",
    "we will concentrate on its moments , the variance , skewness , kurtosis and so on . for a given set of moments in the initial conditions ( ic )",
    ", we would like to derive the final moments using the exact dynamics that rule the evolution of the underlying field .",
    "the problem is that the exact solution to the dynamical equations is only known for the linear regime of the evolution of these fields and only approximate solutions are known for their corresponding non - linear stages .",
    "the spherical infall model has been used to provide a qualitative picture of how isolated ( gravitationally bound ) structures evolve up to their final collapse . in particular",
    ", the spherical model gives an estimation of when the first astrophysical objects formed purely under influence of gravity ( see pebbles 1980 , and references therein ) .",
    "this motivated the development of the so - called press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) which gives the distribution of collapsed objects as a function of their mass .",
    "it is commonly assumed that highly non - linear objects such as galaxies form at peaks ( values above a threshold ) of the underlying matter density field , what provides a possible mechanism for the segregation ( _ bias _ ) between luminous and dark matter in the universe ( kaiser 1984 , bardeen 1986 ) .",
    "more recently , mo & white ( 1996 ) have extended the spherical collapse model to build a model for the spatial clustering of non - linear objects such as dark matter halos .",
    "here we shall explain how the spherical collapse model also appears in the context of cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "cosmological perturbation theory ( pt ) provides a framework to study small departures from linear theory : the weakly non - linear regime . the leading order contribution to the skewness for gaussian initial conditions ( gic )",
    "was obtained by peebles ( 1980 ) . fry ( 1984 ) extended this result to higher order moments and bernardeau ( 1992 , hereafter b92 ) found the generating function to the leading order contribution : the tree - level solution .",
    "comparison with observations and simulations made it necessary to develop pt for the smoothed fields .",
    "the smoothing corrections to the unsmoothed amplitudes for a power - law were first computed for the skewness for either a top - hat or a gaussian window function by juskiewicz ( 1993 ) . for a top - hat filter , bernardeau 1994a ( hereafter b94a ) developed the machinery to systematically derive the smoothed hierarchical amplitudes for either the density ( @xmath5 ) or the velocity divergence ( @xmath6 ) fields to an arbitrary order ( and arbitrary power spectrum ) .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations ( baugh , gaztaaga , efstathiou 1995 , hereafter bge95 ; gaztaaga & baugh 1995 , colombi 1996 ) .",
    "work by matsubara ( 1994 ) and @xmath7okas ( 1995 ) include some results for the gaussian - smoothed density and velocity cumulants .",
    "the success of the pt approach made it plausible to go further and study higher order ( loop ) corrections and the case of non - gaussian initial conditions ( ngic ) . despite the impressive achievements in the diagrammatic approach to loop corrections in pt by scoccimarro @xmath8 frieman 1996a and 1996b , ( hereafter sf96a and sf96b , respectively )",
    ", the analytic entanglement faced when carrying out the calculations for the smoothed one - point cumulants is enormous .",
    "moreover , regularization techniques must be used to evaluate the loop corrections through the kernels in fourier space which , for a value of the spectral index @xmath9 lead to logarithmic divergences which become powers of the cut - off used in the regularization for @xmath10 .",
    "this puts constraints on the domain of applicability of the exact pt itself .",
    "when it comes to calculating the statistics of the smoothed fields , further analytic entanglement makes comparison with simulations and observations be restricted to few discrete values of the spectral index ( scoccimarro 1997 , hereafter s97 ) . for non - gaussian initial conditions we have to face similar problems to start with , as loop corrections could enter at the same order than the tree - level contribution .",
    "the general results derived by bernardeau ( b92 , b94a and bernardeau 1994b , hereafter b94b ) show that the generating function follows the equation for the spherical collapse model . in this context",
    "this remarkable result lacked a satisfactory interpretation .",
    "what is the connection between pt and the spherical collapse model ?",
    "why does the generating function follow an equation for a fluctuating field ?",
    "why is the smoothed generating function given by the same unsmoothed result but with a different argument ? is this related to the gaussian nature of the ic or the flatness of space ? in this paper we will present a simple interpretation for these results , which will allow us to extend it to higher - order corrections and non - gaussian initial conditions ( ngic ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the monopole approximation to pt in  [ sec : mon_pt ] . in section  [ sec : pt ] we give a brief account of the estimation of the cumulants in pt and some of its nonlinear approximations .",
    "we investigate the spherical collapse ( sc ) model and its relation to pt in  [ sec : sc ] . in section ",
    "[ sec : comparison ] we present a comparison of the sc model with exact pt and n - body simulations .",
    "general formulas for the one - point cumulants from a local transformation of the density field in _ lagrangian _ space ( for gic ) are provided in appendix [ app : locumul ] . a comparison with analog results in _ euler _ space is given in appendix [ app : euler ] . an alternative derivation of the smoothing effects in fourier space for a top - hat window is illustrated in appendix [ app : nu2 ] .",
    "further results are derived for the spherically symmetric zeldovich approximation in appendix [ app : za ] .",
    "we will now review briefly the main features of perturbation theory ( pt ) to present the spherical symmetric solution or monopole approximation . throughout this paper",
    "we shall focus on gaussian initial conditions and the einstein - desitter scenario ( frw with @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) to gain simplicity .",
    "however , a generalisation of the current approach to non - gaussian ic and non - flat frw universes will be provided in two accompanying papers ( see gaztaaga & fosalba 1998 , fosalba & gaztaaga 1998 , papers ii & iii , hereafter ) .      in a non - relativistic presureless ( collisionless ) expanding universe , the field equations for the local fluctuation field @xmath13 in euler space are :    + 1&= & 0 [ continu ] + + + 1()&= & - 1 + ^2 & = & 4 g | a^2 [ fieldeq ] which correspond to the mass conservation , euler and poisson equations respectively .",

    "[ cosmo ] here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the present values of the hubble constant and background density , and @xmath17 is the cosmological constant ( see peebles 1980 ) .",
    "a convenient approach to solve the field equations above is to expand the density contrast @xmath3 assuming it is small as is usually done in the context of perturbation theory ( pt ) in euler space , ( , t ) = _ 1(,t ) + _ 2(,t)+ _ 3(,t ) ... , [ pt ] were we assume that @xmath18 .",
    "the first term @xmath19 is the solution to the linearized field equations and is given in terms of the linear growth factor @xmath20 .",
    "the second term @xmath21 is the second - order solution , obtained by using the linear solution in the source terms , and so on .",
    "the dominant mode to the linear pt solution , @xmath22 , is given in terms of the linear growth factor @xmath20 : _",
    "l(x , t ) & = & d(t )  ( x,0 ) + d(t ) & = &  _ 0^a da  ^-3 , [ dt ] which for @xmath23 , the so - called einstein - desitter universe , gives @xmath24 .",
    "the linear approximation is therefore trivially local : _ the evolution of a density fluctuation at a given point is not affected by its neighboring density fluctuations _ , and all fluctuations grow with time at the same rate .",
    "beyond linear order , the equations of motion can be integrated for an einstein - de sitter universe , yielding for the growing mode ( peebles 1980 ) , _ 2 = 57_l^2+_l , _ , + 27 _ , _ , [ secpert ] where @xmath25 are partial space derivatives and we denote , @xmath26 , explicitly shows that , although @xmath27 is of order @xmath28 , pt is formally _ non - local _ already at the second order as explicitly realized by the term accounting for the potential generated by the density fluctuations at different points ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "in fact , the non - local nature of gravity is an intrinsic feature of general relativity and remains so in the newtonian limit through the tidal forces when the appropriate limit to the equations of motion is taken as was recently shown by kofman & pogosyan ( 1995 ) .    to win simplicity in the equations of motion",
    "it is convenient to work in fourier space : ( ) d^3x ( ) , so that one can formally write , @xmath30 , being @xmath31 the @xmath32-th order perturbative contribution .",
    "this is expressed as an @xmath32-dimensional integral over the kernels , @xmath33 , that encode the non - linear coupling of modes due to the gravitational evolution , _ n ( ) & = & d^3q_1 ...",

    "if we are in a situation where there is spherical symmetry we can substitute the kernels @xmath33 in eq.[[deltan ] ] by numbers @xmath36 .",
    "this numbers are given by the _ monopole _",
    "term in an expansion of the kernels in spherical harmonics as they correspond to their angle averages ( the outcome of the angular integrals in eq.[[gaustree ] ] ) .",

    "we shall define , for convenience , the _ monopole _ in terms of some numbers @xmath36 in the way , f_n^l=0 = _ n / n ! , [ monop ] where the factor @xmath38 reflects the fact that we are looking for some symmetric amplitudes .",
    "for instance , from eq.[[f2 ] ] we have , f_2^l=0 = _ 2/2 !",
    "[ nu2 ] on the other hand , we can write the density fluctuation as formed of some generic _ local _ and _ non - local _ components , ( ) ^loc ( ) + ^nloc ( ) where _ local _ means that the evolved ( non - linear ) density contrast at a given point is only a transformation of the linear density contrast at the same point , what we shall call a _ local - density _ transformation , @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the _ non - local _ component gives the contribution from density fluctuations at any other points .",
    "this is non - vanishing to all orders beyond the second in pt as commented above ( see  [ subsec : pt ] ) since gravity induces a non - local ( non - isolated ) evolution of the density fluctuations .",

    "we will now show the connection between the tree - graphs in the diagrammatic approach to the one - point statistics and the _ monopole _ contribution to the kernels .",
    "this will allow us to use a simple local non - linear transformation ( what we shall call the _ local - density _ transformation ) to derive the predictions for the cumulants in the perturbative regime from the _ monopole _ contribution alone .",
    "the perturbative solutions above can be used to study the evolved statistical properties of the density fluctuations , which is our final goal . here",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath49th - order moments of the fluctuating field : @xmath50 . in this notation",
    "the variance is defined as : var ( ) ^2 m_2 - m_1 ^ 2 in general , it is interesting to introduce the _ connected moments _ @xmath0 , which carry statistical information independent of the lower order moments , and are formally denoted by a bracket with subscript @xmath51 : _ j ^j the connected moments are also called _",
    "cumulants _ , _ reduced _ moments or _",
    "irreducible _ moments . for a gaussian distribution @xmath52 for @xmath53 . in many cases",
    "the higher order cumulants of a particular distribution are given in terms of the second order one @xmath54 .",
    "it is therefore convenient to introduce some more definitions .",
    "dimensional scaling _ of the higher order moments in terms of the second order one @xmath55 is given by the following ratios : b_j = _ j [ dimratios ] we will see that for gaussian initial conditions in perturbation theory , it is more useful to introduce the _ hierarchical coefficients _ , s_j= , [ sj ] as pt predicts this quantities to be time - independent quantities on large scales . these amplitudes are also called normalized one - point cumulants or reduced cumulants .",
    "we shall also use _ skewness _",
    ", for @xmath56 and _ kurtosis _ , for @xmath57 .",
    "the way to proceed is to substitute the pt calculations eq.[[deltan ] ] and commute the spatial integrals in @xmath58 with the expectation values @xmath59 , by using the _ fair sample hypothesis _ (  30 peebles 1980 ) .",
    "thus the calculation will reduce to averages over moments of @xmath60 with the kernels in eq.[[deltan ] ] , which will , in turn , give us the statistical properties of @xmath3 in term of the ones in the ic .",
    "if we only consider the first term in the pt series , eq.[[pt ] ] , and the growing mode , eq.[[dt ] ] , the cumulants of the evolved field will just be , @xmath61 , were @xmath62 correspond to the cumulants in the ic .",
    "consistently , the hierarchical ratios ( see eq.[[sj ] ] ) will scale as , @xmath63 , were @xmath64 are the initial ratios .",
    "note that this implies that the linear growth erases the initial hierarchical ratios , so that @xmath65 , as time evolves ( and @xmath66 ) .    in terms of the dimensional",
    "scaling , see eq.[[dimratios ] ] , we have , @xmath67 , so that the linear growth preserves the initial values . note that if we want to do a meaningful calculation of these ratios or the cumulants , in general , we might need to consider more terms in the perturbation series , eq.[[pt ] ] , depending on the statistical properties of the ic , how they scale with the initial variance , which is typically the smallness parameter in the expansion of the cumulants .    for gic both @xmath68 , and",
    "we have to consider higher order terms in the perturbation series to be able to make a non - vanishing prediction .",
    "the computation of the cumulants in pt dates back to peebles ( 1980 ) work where the leading order contribution to the skewness was obtained making use of the second - order pt as given in eq.[[secpert ] ] to give , s_3 = 34 + , [ peebles ] in agreement with the hierarchical scaling : @xmath69 .",
    "fry ( 1984 ) extended peebles analysis by making the connection between tree diagrams ( or tree - graphs ) and the perturbative contributions to leading order in the gaussian case . with the help of this formalism he was able to obtain the leading order contributions for the three- and four - point functions making use of the 2nd and 3rd order in pt .",
    "later on , bernardeau ( 1992 ) found the generating function of the one - point cumulants to leading order for gic .",
    "furthermore , fry ( 1984 ) found that , in general , the lowest order ( tree - level ) connected part that contributes to the @xmath49-order cumulant , @xmath0 , is of order @xmath70 in @xmath60 from terms like : _",
    "1 ^ 2 _ 2^j-2 + ... + _ 1^j-1 _ j-1 .",
    "[ tree ] note that this involves the cancellation of @xmath71 contributions to the connected moment of order @xmath49 .",
    "this is a property of the gaussian initial conditions for which all @xmath72 vanish for @xmath53 .",
    "the above result eq.[[tree ] ] can be understood as follows .",
    "we are only interested in estimating the leading - order contribution ( in terms of @xmath60 ) to the connected part of the spatial average of the product @xmath73 , that contribution made with terms that can not be factorized as products containing disjoint subsets of the labels .",
    "each @xmath3 is to be replaced with the perturbative expansion ( see eq.[[pt ] ] ) , so that it may contain an arbitrary power in @xmath60 . in the gaussian case , the moments factorized only by pairs , so that the smaller contribution , with the smaller number of @xmath60 , connecting @xmath49 points has @xmath74 pairs",
    "each pair corresponds to two @xmath60 and therefore the leading contribution has indeed @xmath70 terms .",
    "these are the tree diagrams , corresponding to graphs with no loops ( as any graph involving loops implies higher orders in @xmath60 ) .",
    "therefore we see that for gic the leading - order contribution to the cumulants ( the so - called tree - level ) is only made of tree diagrams ( or tree graphs ) .",
    "that is why it is called the _ tree - level_. we shall see in a companion paper ( see paper ii ) that the leading - order to the cumulants for non - gaussian ic is not solely made of tree diagrams as there are additional terms which depend on the initial @xmath32-point correlation functions .",
    "consider a generic term of a tree - level contribution such as @xmath75 . from eq.[[deltan ] ] we have : & & _",

    "1(_1) ... _1(_n ) _ 1(_2) ... _1(_n-1 ) [ deltani ] thus we only have to perform the spatial integral over the initial moments @xmath76 . in the case of gic",
    "these moments are just products of two - point functions .",
    "the only terms in the products of two - point functions that produce _ connected _ graphs have pairs connected like : & & d^3q_1",
    "... d^3q_n _ d(_1-_1 ... -_n ) f_n(_1 ...",

    "1(_n-1 ) , [ gaustree ] those terms with pairs of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as otherwise there is a part of the integral that factorizes .",
    "by isotropy , one sees that the only dependence in the angles between the @xmath77 s comes through @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the geometrical dependence in eq.[[gaustree ] ] can be integrated out and the contribution of the kernels @xmath33 just becomes a constant .",
    "thus , _ the ( gaussian ) tree - level is given by the monopole and therefore by the local contribution to the density fluctuation _",
    "( see  [ sec : monopole ] ) . as a result , in this scheme",
    ", the higher - order multipoles in the kernels are only expected to yield a non - vanishing contribution in the next - to - leading orders ( loops ) in the cumulants , while the monopole contributes to all perturbative orders . in what follows",
    "we shall deal with the _ local _ contribution to the density fluctuation alone , @xmath80 ( monopole in the kernels ) and work out its 1-point statistics .",
    "we can now easily estimate _ all _ the 1-point statistical properties in the _ monopole _ approximation to pt .",
    "this can be done by using the generating function method : _ j = ^j = .",
    "d^j |_t=0 , [ generating ] where @xmath81 is the _ moment generating functional _ of the one - point probability distribution functional , and the field @xmath82 is given by eq.[[local ] ] . furthermore , @xmath83 $ ] is the _",
    "cumulant generating functional _ so that eq.[[generating ] ] yields a simple derivation of the cumulants in terms of the moments .",
    "a general discussion in terms of the @xmath84-point correlation functions and its computation using diagrammatic techniques ( similar to those in quantum field theory ) is given in detail in sf96a .",
    "the resulting expressions can be found in fry & gaztaaga ( 1993 , fg93 hereafter ) , who consider a generic local transformation between density fields and find , to leading terms in @xmath85 : s_3 & = & 3 c_2 + ( _ l^2 ) + s_4 & = & 4 c_3 + 12 c_2 ^ 2 + ( _ l^2 ) + s_5 & = & 5 c_4 + 60 c_3 c_2 + 60 c_2 ^ 3 + ( _ l^2 ) [ hierarg ] for gaussian initial conditions .",
    "note that the leading contribution to @xmath5 is enough to specify all the coefficients @xmath44 in the transformation , and therefore all higher order corrections .",
    "as expected , by substituting @xmath86 by the monopole contribution : @xmath87 in eq.[[nu2 ] ] , one recovers peebles ( 1980 ) calculation , eq.[[peebles ] ] .",
    "we shall stress that the _ local - density transformation _ ( see eq.[[local ] ] ) is just a particular case of what is usually understood as _",
    "local_. in general , it means that the value of the evolved field at a given point is a transformation of the ic at the same point , say , the initial value of the field , its derivatives and any other fields ( the velocity field ) contributing at that very point .",
    "although gravity is non - local in this restricted sense , the above results show that the statistical average of the non - local integrals involved in the reduced moments to leading order are exactly given by a _ local - density _ transformation .    however , to estimate the leading order ( tree - level ) it is not necessary to calculate the full kernels @xmath33 , as we only need the @xmath44 numbers , the _ monopole _",
    "( spherically symmetric ) contribution .",
    "therefore , _ the values of @xmath44 ( and thus the appropriate local - density transformation ) can be determined by finding the spherically symmetric solution to the equations of motion_. we shall see below that for the gravitational evolution of the density field in lagrangian space , this transformation is given by the spherical collapse ( sc ) model , whereas for the za to the dynamics , it is given by what we shall call the spherically symmetric za ( ssza ) .",
    "in one dimension , the probability distribution function of the matter field may be integrated in lagrangian coordinates making use of the zeldovich approximation ( za ) which recovers the exact dynamics .",
    "for the three - dimensional case however , the za fails to describe the exact picture since the displacement field ( that only depends on the ic ) no longer factorizes in the actual solution for the growing mode as the za assumes ( bernardeau @xmath8 kofman 1995 ) .    in the context of lagrangian space and inspired by the successful results of the zeldovich approximation ( hereafter za )",
    ", there have appeared in the last years a number of papers presenting some local approximations to the exact dynamics that successfully describe the evolution of the density contrast in its first non - linear stages ( see bertschinger and jain 1994 , hui and bertschinger 1996 ) .",
    "most recently , protogeros and scherrer ( 1997 , hereafter ps97 ) , following the formalism of the za , made use of a closed analytic expression , @xmath88 , to derive the cumulants following the formal analogy between the density contrast and the vertex generating function at tree level ( see b92 ) , for different values of @xmath89 , which they take to be different approximations to the exact pt .",
    "for the particular case when @xmath90 ( what they call the `` spherical approximation '' ) their approximation happens to be equal to the spherically symmetric solution to the dynamics ( in 3 dimensions ) for the za ( what we call ssza in appendix [ app : za ] ) .",
    "they also consider the case @xmath91 as another approximation they call the `` exact approximation '' ( which , in fact , only reproduces the exact tree - level when @xmath92 ) . in general , none of these local approximations recovers the exact tree - level amplitudes as predicted by pt ( which we will show later that is given by the sc model ) .    on the other hand , a number of non - local approximations to the non - linear dynamics of the cosmological fields have been designed as to simplify the equations of motion by linearising any of the fields involved . the linear ( or frozen ) potential approximation ( lpa ) which assumes that the gravitational potential generated by the density perturbations remains linear throughout the evolution ( see brainerd 1993 , bagla and padmanabhan 1994 ) , the frozen flow approximation ( ffa ) that takes the velocity field to be frozen to its initial shape ( see matarrese 1992 ) , along with the za , which deals with the approximation that particles move on straight lines in the comoving picture ( see zeldovich 1970 ) , are the best known among them .",
    "a general treatment in terms of the vertex generating function can be found in munshi ( 1995 ) . for a review of all these approximations",
    "see bernardeau ( 1994 ) .",
    "if we write the second perturbative order as given by eq.[[secpert ] ] , in the generic form : = _ l+a_l^2+b_l , _ , + c _ ,",
    "_ , , one may derive the skewness at tree - level in the parametric fashion , s_3 = 9a-3b+5c , from which we can characterize the different above cited approximations depending on the weight each of them gives to these three different contributions : while pt gives @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , the za yields @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath96 , whereas the ffa gives @xmath96 , @xmath96 , @xmath98 , and the lpa gets @xmath96 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , as the corresponding values for @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively , in each approximation . by just replacing the numbers in @xmath56",
    "one sees that none of these non - linear approximations is able to reproduce the exact tree - level amplitude given by pt for the skewness .",
    "this illustrates that , despite successfully describing the first non - linear stages of the gravitational collapse of a density fluctuation , none of the above given approximations yields to accurate enough predictions concerning the one - point cumulants in the perturbative regime .      whenever @xmath104 , corrective terms beyond leading order ( tree - level ) become quantitatively important and must be taken into account .",
    "a systematic approach for deriving the next - to - leading orders in pt was introduced by goroff ( 1986 ) by representing them in terms of the _ loop _ diagrams .",
    "recently , the first results for the _ loop _ corrections in pt have been calculated ( see sf96a , sf96b and s97 ) .",
    "the angle averaged ( spherically symmetric ) picture described above can be used to estimate the _ monopole _ contribution to an arbitrary higher - order in pt .",
    "this is easy to do as one just has to take more terms in the series given by eq.[[local ] ] to calculate the next orders in the moments . as expected , even in the gaussian case , the higher - order terms coming from the monopole contribution differ from the exact pt estimates .",
    "bernardeau ( 1994c , b94c hereafter ) already realised that fact when tracing the non - linear evolution of a volume occupied by particles that were in a given initial density perturbation .",
    "if one assumes that the matter content of a fluctuation is conserved during its collapse , then tracing the evolution of the volume is equivalent to following that of the matter density . in his work",
    ", the density fluctuation follows the sc model in what he called the _ rare event limit _",
    ", when @xmath105 , thus it is only exact as a mean picture of the actual collapse , with no scatter , i.e. @xmath106 .",
    "we have seen above that , in fourier space , the departure of the sc picture from the exact pt is because the exact integrations in this case , such as that in eq.[[deltani ] ] with more @xmath22 factors , involve loops and the geometrical dependence is not trivial anymore ( the dipole , quadrupole ... contributions no longer cancel ) ; the kernel @xmath33 integration will give a different number depending on the loop configuration ( see sf96a ) , contrary to the monopole approximation ( were @xmath33 is always replaced by the same amplitude @xmath107 ) .",
    "however , one can naively expect the monopole contribution to dominate by symmetry because asymmetric contributions ( arising from tidal terms ) tend to cancel when averaged . in this paper",
    "we shall compute the monopole contribution to pt and will compare it to the exact analytic results , when available , or n - body simulations , to see how accurate this approximation is .",
    "we next want to derive the evolution of a density fluctuation within the spherical model of collapse . in order to do that",
    ", we turn to the lagrangian space which is the natural framework for describing the motion of a fluid element .",
    "the sc dynamics is fully described in terms of one parameter , the initial size of the spherical fluctuation . in this sense ,",
    "the sc model is just a particular case within the family of _ local - density _ approximations discussed above . when we write the equations in lagrangian space , the natural variable is the density contrast and the only parameter in terms of which the solution is given is the linear density contrast .",
    "we first must define the conformal time @xmath108 which is the comoving time parameter to the motion of the mass and we shall denote with a dot the associated time derivatives ( conformal time derivatives ) , defined as , = + _ q a(t)d dt , @xmath109 being the scale factor . the generic equation describing the evolution of a spherically symmetric perturbation in an expanding universe is given by , = -gm(r ) r^2 = -4 g r [ scradial ] since the matter contained in a spherical perturbation of radius r is , @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the spherical density perturbation @xmath111 , is described by the following equation of motion + h ( ) -43 ^ 2 ( 1+)= 4 g ( - ) a()^2 ( 1 + ) .",
    "[ scdyn ] where the dot denotes a conformal time derivative , and @xmath112 is the scale factor in terms of the conformal time from which we define the conformal hubble parameter @xmath113 . introducing the comoving time derivative , @xmath114 , the last equation translates into , + 2h ( t)-43 ^ 2 ( 1+)= 4 g ( 1 + ) , [ comsc ] where @xmath115 .",
    "if we are only interested in the perturbative regime ( @xmath124 ) , which is the relevant one for the description of structure formation on large scales , the above solution can be also expressed directly in terms of the initial density contrast , which plays the role of the initial size of the spherical fluctuation in eq.[[comsc ] ] . this way , the evolved density contrast in the perturbative regime is given by a _ local - density _ transformation of the linear density fluctuation , = f(_l ) = _ n=1^ _ n",
    "n ! [ _ l]^n [ loclag ] notice that all the dynamical information in the sc model is encoded in the @xmath36 coefficients of this _ local - density transformation _ ,",
    "eq.[[loclag ] ] . in an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath125 frw universe )",
    ", we can introduce the above power series expansion in eq.[[comsc ] ] and determine the @xmath36 coefficients one by one .",
    "the first ones turn out to be , & & _ 2 = 3421 ~1.62 ; _ 3 = 682189 ~3.61 + & & _ 4 = 44644043659 ~10.22 ; _ 5 = 8546480243243 ~35.13 [ nusc ] and so on .",
    "remember that this evolution is in _ lagrangian _ space , @xmath126 .",
    "we would like to relate the above results , obtained in lagrangian coordinates to the corresponding fluctuation in eulerian coordinates . in lagrangian space a fluid element of a given mass is labeled by its initial position @xmath77 ( or lagrangian coordinate ) , whereas eulerian space uses the density @xmath127 at the final coordinate @xmath128 .",
    "notice that mass conservation requires that the volume elements be related like : @xmath129 .",
    "thus density probabilities in lagrangian ( @xmath130 ) and eulerian ( @xmath131 ) space should also be related by the same factor , @xmath132 ( see kofman 1994 ) .",
    "this provides a simple way to translate density moments in eulerian space , @xmath133 with the ones in lagrangian space @xmath134 , & & ( 1+)^j _ l = ( 1+)^j p [ ] _ l = + & & ( 1+)^j+1 p [ ] _ e = ( 1+)^j+1 _ e. [ lag2eul+ ] in particular , as pointed out by bernardeau ( b94b ) ( and also ps97 ) , the conservation of eulerian volume yields , @xmath135 , which requires a normalization for @xmath3 in eq.[[loclag ] ] : 1+= ( 1 + f ) ( 1+f)^-1 _ l. [ normalag ] it is interesting to note from eq.[[lag2eul+ ] ] that : ^j _",
    "l = ^j _ e + ^j+1 _ e . [ lag2eul ] thus , to leading order , there is no difference between eulerian and lagrangian moments . in general , the leading contribution to the cumulants is enough to specify all the coefficients @xmath44 ( see eq.[[hierarg ] ] ) , of the local transformation provided by eq.[[local ] ] .",
    "this means that the local - density transformations that produce the tree - level in pt are identical in euler and lagrangian space .",
    "a similar result was noted by protogeros & scherrer ( ps97 ) , in the context of hierarchical distributions , but this argument is more general as applies to any non - gaussian distributions where : @xmath136 , which holds even for the strongly non - gaussian dimensional models , eq.[[dimratios ] ] , that we shall investigate later ( see paper ii ) .",
    "these models for the ic naturally appear as solutions for the topological defects models for structure formation .",
    "our goal here is to relate the cumulants of the initial distribution with the ones resulting from the full non - linear evolution of the field . to estimate the evolved cumulants under the sc model , we perform the following prescription :",
    "note that the cumulants obtained from ( b)+(c ) , which are appendix [ app : locumul ] ( see eq.[[scgic ] ] ) , are not the same as the ones obtained using the local - density relation in _ euler _ space directly ( see appendix [ app : euler ] ) . as explicitly seen from eq.[[lag2eul ] ] , they are only the same to leading order .",
    "we choose this approach because the lagrangian space , comoving with the fluid element , is the natural coordinate system for a local description of its evolution .",
    "note that a local - density description in lagrangian space will in general mean a non - local one in euler space .",
    "we have pointed out in the previous sections that the monopole contribution ( which is the exact result for tree - graphs ) to the cumulants in pt is given by a local - density transformation eq.[[local ] ] , whose coefficients , @xmath44 , are to be determined by the kernels , @xmath33 ( see eq.[[deltan ] ] ) , under the relevant dynamics .",
    "these arguments are valid for any dynamics and apply either to euler or lagrangian space .",
    "they are true for any leading order calculation . as argued in section ",
    "[ sec : eqofla ] , to estimate this contribution to the cumulants it is not necessary to calculate the full kernels @xmath33 , as we only need the numbers @xmath44 . given the equations for the evolution of a field , one can determine eq.[[local ] ] and therefore @xmath44 by just requiring the solutions to be _ spherically symmetric_.    we have shown above that for gravity , the spherically symmetric solution to the evolution of density perturbations is given by eq.[[scdyn ] ] , the sc model , whose solution is well - known ( see eq.[[loclag ] ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath139 which yields the monopole contribution , @xmath48 , without need of estimating the kernels @xmath33 or any integral . note , in particular , that @xmath140 from both approaches ( see eqs.[[nu2]],[[nusc ] ] ) .",
    "this provides with a simpler derivation and interpretation of the results presented by b92 , who found the values @xmath36 that give the leading - order contribution to pt for gaussian initial conditions . in the language of b92 , the vertex generating function , @xmath141 ( see also ps97 ) .",
    "our derivation explains therefore why the vertex generating function @xmath142 follows the sc model , which lacked a satisfactory explanation in the context of b92 .",
    "besides its simplicity , in our framework one has the added advantage of being able to use the local - density relation to estimate the higher - order corrections for both gaussian and non - gaussian initial conditions ( see paper ii ) . note nevertheless that there is an important difference in practice with the work of b92 .",
    "his vertex generating function @xmath142 , corresponds to cumulants in euler space , while our local - density relation @xmath143 , applies to lagrangian space . to leading order ,",
    "both give identical results for gaussian ic , but they yield different results in general for non - gaussian ic or for next - to - leading terms for gaussian ic .",
    "we want to stress that the fact the sc model determines the tree - level amplitudes is neither a singular property of the gaussian nature of the ic nor an argument that has to do with the flat geometry of space .",
    "it is a general property that follows straightforwardly from the _ local _ nature of the monopole contribution to pt ( see section ",
    "[ sec : eqofla ] ) : _ the tree - graphs ( and the monopole contribution ) in pt are exactly given by the sc model regardless of either the statistical nature of the initial conditions or the geometry of the universe_. we shall illustrate the above statement in the framework of b92 calculations by showing , in an accompanying paper ( fosalba & gaztaaga 1998 , paper iii in this issue ) , that the equations of motion that govern the leading order amplitudes ( for gaussian initial conditions ) in a universe with arbitrary density parameter @xmath144 , are those of the sc dynamics .",
    "so far we have worked out the statistics of the unsmoothed fields .",
    "there remains to be seen whether the local - density approximation may be extended to the statistics of the spatially smoothed fields , which is essential if we are to compare with n - body simulations and observations .",
    "for that purpose , we have to introduce the fluctuating field integrated over a _ finite _ volume .",
    "this volume is fixed by the size of the window function that acts as a filter on the unsmoothed field .",
    "our goal is therefore to relate the _ smoothed _ cumulants in the evolved distribution with the _ smoothed _ cumulants in the initial one .",
    "the latter are _ inputs _ to our calculations and should tell us , how the smoothed _ rms _ fluctuation changes as a function of the smoothing radius : @xmath145 .",
    "we will focus here in the top - hat filter , defined as , w_th ( , r ) & = & 1 if r , being zero otherwise , where @xmath146 is the smoothing radius .",
    "note that this filter is spherically symmetric so that the transformation that gets from the unsmoothed to the smoothed evolved fields preserves the spherical symmetry .    in the local - density picture of the spherical collapse ,",
    "each fluctuation is isolated from the others and evolves according to the value of the initial amplitude alone .",
    "the statistics of the evolved field is just induced by the statistics of the initial one , which could in general be non - gaussian . in order to estimate the statistical properties ( one - point cumulants )",
    "we can therefore picture the initial spatial distribution as just made of a single spherical fluctuation .",
    "different realizations of this fluctuation could have different amplitudes or shapes in a proportion given so as to match the statistics of the initial conditions ( see  61 peebles 1980 for examples ) . in our case",
    "this is given in terms of the _ unsmoothed _ distribution , which corresponds to a top - hat smoothing of radius @xmath147 .",
    "the spatial smoothing only acts on the fluctuation by changing its amplitude .",
    "we want , by construction , the new amplitude to be a function of the smoothing radius , @xmath146 .",
    "thus , for the initial conditions @xmath22 , the smoothed field is : _",
    "l(r ) = _ l(r ) _ l [ sigmahatl ] as smoothing does not change the statistics directly ( at least for a top - hat ) .",
    "a similar argument applies to the evolved field , which under the sc model is just a local transformation of the initial fluctuations , which only changes the local amplitude : = [ sigmahat ] where @xmath148 is the smoothed fluctuation and @xmath3 the unsmoothed one .",
    "the statistics of @xmath148 will therefore be given by the unsmoothed statistics , @xmath3 , which are in turn given by the local - density relation eq.[[loclag ] ] : @xmath149 $ ] . using eq.[[sigmahatl ] ] we express this as a function of the linear smoothed fluctuation @xmath150 : [ _ l ] ~f[_l _ l ] [ deltahat ] where @xmath151 just means that @xmath148 needs to be normalized , as explained before ( see eq.[[normalag ] ] ) .",
    "note that the input _ rms _ fluctuation is a function of the smoothing radius , @xmath146 , which also fixes the amplitude of the final smoothed fluctuation .",
    "as the smoothing radius @xmath146 is , by construction , larger than the unsmoothed one @xmath152 , we have for the smoothed fluctuation : @xmath153 , as there is no other smoothing than the sharp cut - off , ( note that this may not be the case for other filters , such as the gaussian smoothing , which changes the initial shape of the fluctuation and therefore the final mass ) .",
    "thus the smoothed amplitude , @xmath154 $ ] , will be a function of @xmath148 through @xmath146 .",
    "this together with eq.[[deltahat ] ] can be used to obtained @xmath148 in a recursive way .",
    "in the case of a power - law power spectrum @xmath155 , the smoothed variance is also a power - law @xmath156 , where @xmath157 .",
    "we then have , @xmath158 .",
    "note that @xmath159 reproduces the unsmoothed result .",
    "moreover , using eq.[[deltahat ] ] , we find : [ _ l ] ~f[_l ( 1+)^/6 ] [ deltahat2 ] up to a normalization factor given by eq.[[normalag ] ] .",
    "note that this final result as well as the general expression eq.[[deltahat ] ] , agrees with b94a arguments , based on the vertex generating function .",
    "however , eqs.[[deltahat]],[[deltahat2 ] ] do not limit themselves to gaussian initial conditions or the leading - order term . here again , the vertex generating function @xmath160 , corresponds to cumulants in euler space , while our local - density relation , @xmath143 , applies to _ lagrangian _ space . to leading order",
    ", they both give identical results with gaussian ic , but they yield different results , in general , for non - gaussian ic or for higher - order terms with gaussian ic .",
    "for an arbitrary power spectrum @xmath162 , the above results can be trivially generalized using eq.[[deltahat ] ] .",
    "the results are given in eq.[[nlscgp ] ] of the appendix [ app : locumul ] .    in appendix",
    "[ app : nu2 ] we present an alternative derivation of the ( top - hat ) smoothing effects within the sc approximation , following the kernels in fourier space .",
    "there , one can explicitly see how in the sc model , smoothing is a trivial operation which only changes the @xmath36 coefficients but not the local nature of the transformation from the linear to the non - linear density field .",
    "in this section we start from the exact solution to the sc dynamics in an einstein - de sitter universe assuming the _ rms _ fluctuation @xmath163 . in that perturbative limit",
    ", we carry out the calculation of the connected moments for the density .",
    "results for the velocity field are provided in paper iii .",
    "we compare the sc predictions with those derived from the exact pt in the context of the diagrammatic approach .",
    "although we know that the sc dynamics exactly reproduces the leading - order contribution to the cumulants , higher order effects will in general be different .",
    "we have seen that the difference is due to neglecting the shear and can therefore be attributed to non - local effects , which we will also call _ tidal _ effects .",
    "note that in our context _ local _ refers only to the density .",
    "as commented above , the results are derived in general for the smoothed fields for a top - hat window function , the unsmoothed fields being recovered just as the particular case @xmath164 . to simplify the expressions",
    ", we will assume that higher order derivatives of the variance ( see appendix [ app : locumul ] , eq.[[eq : gamma ] ] with @xmath165 for @xmath166 ) can be neglected .",
