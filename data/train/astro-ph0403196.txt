    "<S> the age of the universe is obtained in a subset of cardassian models by using wmap data . </S>",
    "<S> cardassian expansion is a modification to the friedmann equation that allows the universe to be flat , matter dominated , and accelerating , without a vacuum component . </S>",
    "<S> since this model changes the evolution of the universe , we should not _ a priori _ expect the cardassian age to be the same as the wmap friedmann derived result of @xmath0 gyrs . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the subset of cardassian models we consider , we discover that the age of the universe varies from 13.4 - 13.8 gyr over the range of parameter space we explore , a result close to that of the standard @xmath1 cold dark matter model . </S>",
    "<S> the hubble constant @xmath2 , which may also vary in these models , likewise varies little from the friedmann result . </S>"
