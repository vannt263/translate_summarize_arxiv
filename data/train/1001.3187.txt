    "in recent years , _ cognitive radio _ ( cr ) networks , where crs or the so - called secondary users ( sus ) communicate over certain bandwidth originally allocated to a primary network , have drawn great research interests in the academic , industrial , and regulation communities .",
    "accordingly , there is now a rapidly growing awareness that cr technology will play an essential role in enabling _ dynamic spectrum access _ for the next generation wireless communications , which could hopefully resolve the spectrum scarcity vs. under - utilization dilemma caused by the current static spectrum management polices . specifically , the users in the primary network , or the so - called primary users ( pus ) , could be licensed users , who have the absolute right to access their spectrum bands , and yet would be willing to share the spectrum with the unlicensed sus .",
    "alternatively , both the pus and sus could equally coexist in an unlicensed band , where the pus are regarded as existing active communication links while the sus are new links to be added .",
    "a unique feature of crs is that they are able to identify and acquire useful environmental information ( cognition ) across the primary and secondary networks , and thereby adapt their transmit strategies to achieve the best performance while maintaining a required quality of service ( qos ) for each coexisting active primary link .",
    "depending on the type of cognitive knowledge collected ( e.g. , on / off statuses of primary links , pu messages , interference power levels at pu receivers , or primary link performance margins ) and the primary / secondary network models of interests ( e.g. , infrastructure - based vs. ad hoc ) , many new and challenging problems on the design of cr networks can be formulated , as will be reviewed in this article .    to date",
    ", quite a few operation models have been proposed for crs ; however , there is no consensus yet on the terminology used for the associated definitions @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , there are two basic operation models for crs : opportunistic spectrum access ( osa ) vs. spectrum sharing ( ss ) . in the osa model , the sus",
    "are allowed to transmit over the band of interest when all the pus are not transmitting at this band .",
    "one essential enabling technique for osa - based crs is _ spectrum sensing _ , where the crs individually or collaboratively detect active pu transmissions over the band , and decide to transmit if the sensing results indicate that all the pu transmitters are inactive at this band with a high probability .",
    "spectrum sensing is now a very active area for research ; the interested readers may refer to , e.g. , @xcite for an overview of the state - of - art results in this area . as a counterpart",
    ", the ss model allows the sus to transmit simultaneously with pus at the same band even if they are active , provided that the sus know how to control their resultant interference at the pu receivers such that the performance degradation of each active primary link is within a tolerable margin .",
    "thus , osa and ss can be regarded as the _ primary - transmitter - centric _ and _ primary - receiver - centric _ dynamic spectrum access techniques , respectively .",
    "consequently , there will be an inevitable debate on which operation model , osa or ss , is better to deploy crs in practical systems ; however , a rigorous comparative study for these two models , in terms of spectrum efficiency and implementation complexity tradeoffs , is still open .",
    "generally speaking , ss utilizes the spectrum more efficiently than osa , since the former supports concurrent pu and su transmissions over the same band while the latter only allows orthogonal transmissions between them .",
    "moreover , the receiver - centric approach for ss is more effective for crs to manage the interference to the pu links than the transmitter - centric approach for osa .",
    "hence , the ss model for crs will be focused in this article .",
    "it is worth noting that the optimal design approach for ss - based cr networks should treat all coexisting pu and su links as a giant interference network and jointly optimize their transmissions to maximize the su network throughput with a prescribed pu network throughput guarantee . from this viewpoint ,",
    "recent advances in network information theory @xcite have provided promising guidelines to approach the fundamental limits of such networks . however , from a practical viewpoint , the centralized design approach for pu and su networks is not desirable , since pu and su systems usually belong to different operators and thus it is difficult , if not infeasible , for them to cooperate . consequently , a _ decentralized _",
    "design approach is more favorable , where the pu network is designed without the awareness of the existence of the su network , while the su network is designed with only partial knowledge ( cognition ) of the pu network .    following this ( simplified ) decentralized approach ,",
    "there are furthermore two design paradigms proposed for ss - based crs .",
    "one is based on the `` cognitive relay '' concept @xcite , where the su transmitter allocates only part of its power to deliver the su messages , and uses the remaining power to relay the pu messages so as to compensate for the additional su interference experienced at the pu receiver .",
    "however , this technique requires non - causal knowledge of the pu messages at the su transmitter , which may be difficult to realize in practice .",
    "in contrast , a more feasible ss design for the su to protect the pu is to impose a constraint on the maximum su interference power at the pu receiver , also known as the `` interference temperature ( it ) '' constraint @xcite , by assuming that the su - to - pu channels are either perfectly known at the su transmitters , or can be practically estimated .    in this article",
    ", we will focus our study on the it - based ss model for crs , namely the it - ss , as it is a more feasible approach compared with other existing ones . in a wireless communication environment ,",
    "channels are usually subject to space - time - frequency variation due to multipath propagation , mobility , and location - dependent shadowing .",
    "thus , _ dynamic resource allocation _ ( dra ) becomes an essential technique for crs to optimally deploy their transmit strategies to maximize the secondary network throughput , where the transmit power , bit - rate , bandwidth , and antenna beam should be dynamically allocated based upon the available channel state information ( csi ) of the primary and secondary networks . in particular , this article will focus on dra problem formulations unique to cr systems under the it - ss model , and the associated solutions that are non - obvious in comparison with existing results @xcite known for the traditional ( non - cr ) wireless networks .",
    "more importantly , we will emphasize the key role of various _",
    "convex optimization _ techniques in solving these problems .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] presents different models of the su network coexisting with the pu network , and various forms of transmit power and interference power ( it ) constraints over the su transmissions .",
    "section [ sec : cr mimo ] is devoted to the spatial - domain transmit optimization at the sus for different su networks subject to transmit and interference power constraints .",
    "section [ sec : spacetime dra ] extends the results to the more general case of joint space - time - frequency transmit optimization of the sus , and addresses the important issue on how to optimally set the it thresholds in cr systems to achieve the best spectrum sharing performance . finally , conclusions are drawn and future research directions are discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .    _ notation : _ lower - case and upper - case bold letters denote vectors and matrices , respectively .",

    "we consider two general types of cr networks , which are of both theoretical and practical interests : one is _ infrastructure - based _ , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model](a ) , where multiple secondary terminals communicate with a common secondary node referred to as the secondary base station ( s - bs ) ; the other is _ ad hoc _ , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model](b ) , which consists of multiple distributed secondary links . in both types of cr networks ,",
    "there are coexisting primary terminals operating in the same spectrum band .",
    "for the it - ss model of crs , the exact operation model of the primary network is not important to our study , provided that all the secondary terminals satisfy the prescribed it constraints to protect the primary terminals . without loss of generality , we assume that there are @xmath20 secondary links and @xmath21 primary terminals in each type of the cr networks .",
    "consider first the infrastructure - based secondary / cr network with the s - bs coordinating all the cr transmissions , which usually corresponds to one particular cell in a cr cellular network .",
    "the uplink transmissions from the sus to the s - bs are usually modeled by a multiple - access channel ( mac ) , while the downlink transmissions from the s - bs to different sus are modeled by a broadcast channel ( bc ) . for the mac",

    "unicast_.    next , consider the ad hoc secondary / cr network , which is usually modeled as an interference channel ( ic ) .",

    "it is assumed that @xmath49 s are independent over @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the @xmath50th pu , @xmath51 , in each type of the cr networks is equipped with @xmath52 antennas , @xmath53 .",
    "we then use @xmath54 to denote the channel from the @xmath26th su to the @xmath50th pu in the cr mac , @xmath55 to denote the channel from s - bs to the @xmath50th pu in the cr bc , and @xmath56 to denote the channel from su - tx@xmath38 to the @xmath50th pu in the cr ic . moreover , the receiving terminals in the secondary networks may experience interference from active primary transmitters . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that such interference is treated as additional noise at the secondary receivers , and the total noise at each secondary receiving terminal is distributed as a cscg random vector with zero mean and the identity covariance matrix .",
    "note that the ( spatial ) channels defined in the above cr network models are assumed constant for a fixed transmit dimension such as one time - block in a time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) system or one frequency - bin in an orthogonal - frequency - division - multiplexing ( ofdm ) system . in a wireless environment",
    ", these channels usually change over time and/or frequency dimensions as governed by an underlying joint stochastic process . as",
    "such , dra becomes relevant to schedule sus into different transmit dimensions based on their csi .",
    "in general , the secondary transmitting terminals need to satisfy two types of power constraints for dra : one is due to their own transmit power budgets ; the other is to limit their resulting interference level at each pu to be below a prescribed threshold .",

    ", four different types of power constraints can be defined for the secondary network . by taking the cr mac as an example ( similarly as for the cr bc / ic ) , we have    * * peak transmit power constraint ( ptpc ) * : @xmath59 ) \\leq p_k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 $ ] denotes the transmit covariance matrix for the @xmath61th transmit dimension of the @xmath26th su , @xmath62 ; @xmath63 denotes the @xmath26th su s peak power constraint that applies to each of the @xmath57 transmit dimensions . * * average transmit power constraint ( atpc ) * : @xmath64 ) \\leq \\bar{p}_k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 denotes the @xmath26th su s average transmit power constraint over the @xmath57 transmit dimensions . * * peak interference power constraint ( pipc ) * : @xmath66{\\bf s}_k[l]{\\bf g}^h_{kj}[l]\\right ) \\leq \\gamma_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 $ ] denotes the realization of channel @xmath68 for a given @xmath61 ; and @xmath69 denotes the peak interference power constraint for protecting the @xmath50th pu , @xmath70 , which limits the total interference power caused by all the @xmath20 sus across all the receiving antennas of the @xmath50th pu , for each of the @xmath57 transmit dimensions . * * average interference power constraint ( aipc ) * : @xmath71{\\bf s}_k[l]{\\bf g}^h_{kj}[l]\\right ) \\leq \\bar{\\gamma}_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 denotes the average interference power constraint for the @xmath50th pu to limit the total interference power from the @xmath20 sus , which is averaged over the @xmath57 transmit dimensions .",
    "note that dra for traditional ( non - cr ) wireless networks under ptpc and/or atpc has been thoroughly studied in the literature @xcite , while the study of dra subject to pipc and/or aipc as well as their various combinations with ptpc / atpc is unique to cr networks and is relatively new . in order to gain more insights into the optimal dra designs for cr networks , we will first study the case of a single transmit dimension ( @xmath73 ) with ptpcs and pipcs by focusing on the spatial - domain transmit optimization for multi - antenna crs in section [ sec : cr mimo ] , and then study the general case of @xmath74 for joint space - time - frequency dra in cr networks under atpcs and aipcs in section [ sec : spacetime dra ] .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of @xmath73 , where the dra for cr networks reduces to the spatial - domain transmit optimization under ptpcs and pipcs to maximize the cr network throughput .",
    "we term this practice as _",
    "cognitive beamforming_. in order to investigate the fundamental performance limits of cognitive beamforming , we study the optimal designs with the availability of perfect knowledge on all the channels in the su networks , and those from all the secondary transmit terminals to pus . for convenience",
    ", we drop the dimension index @xmath61 for the rest of this section given @xmath73 .",
    "first , it is worth noting that the pipc given in ( [ eq : pipc ] ) can be unified with the ptpc given in ( [ eq : ptpc ] ) into a form of _ generalized linear transmit covariance constraint _ ( gltcc ) : @xmath75 where @xmath76 s and @xmath77 are constants .",
    "for example , with each pipc given in ( [ eq : pipc ] ) , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , while for each ptpc given in ( [ eq : ptpc ] ) , @xmath80 if @xmath81 and @xmath7 otherwise , with @xmath82 .",
    "previous studies on transmit optimization for multi - antenna or multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems have mostly adopted some special forms of gltcc such as the user individual power constraints and sum - power constraint .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether such existing solutions are applicable to the general form of gltcc , which is crucial to the problem of cr mimo transmit optimization with the newly added pipcs . in the following",
    ", we provide an overview of the state - of - art solutions for this problem under different cr network models , while the developed solutions also apply to the case with the general form of gltccs as in ( [ eq : gltcc ] ) . from a convex optimization perspective",
    ", we next divide our discussions into two parts , which deal with the cases of convex and non - convex problem formulations , respectively .",
    "first , consider the case where the associated optimization problem in a traditional mimo system without pipc is _",
    "convex_. in such cases , since the extra pipcs are linear over the su transmit covariance matrices , the resulting transmit covariance optimization problem for cr systems remains convex ; and thus , it can be efficiently solved by standard convex optimization techniques .",
    "* cr point - to - point mimo channel : * we elaborate this case by first considering the cr point - to - point mimo channel , which can be treated as the special case with only one active su link in the mac , bc , or ic based cr network . without loss of generality , we will use the notations developed for the cr mac with @xmath83 in the following discussions . specifically ,",
    "the optimal transmit covariance to achieve the cr point - to - point mimo channel capacity under both the ptpc and pipcs can be obtained from the following problem @xcite : @xmath84 where for conciseness we have removed the su index @xmath26 in the symbol notations since @xmath83 , while @xmath85 means that @xmath11 is a positive semi - definite matrix @xcite .",
    "we see that ( p1 ) is a convex optimization problem since its objective function is concave over @xmath11 and its constraints define a convex set over @xmath11 .",
    "thus , ( p1 ) can be efficiently solved by , e.g. , the interior point method @xcite . in the special case of cr multiple - input single - output ( miso ) channel ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath86 degrades to a row - vector denoted by @xmath87 , it can be shown by exploiting the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) optimality conditions of ( p1 ) that transmit beamforming is capacity optimal , i.e. , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "thus , without loss of generality we could write @xmath89 , where @xmath90 denotes the precoding vector . accordingly , ( p1 ) for the special case of miso cr channel is simplified as ( p1-s ) @xcite : @xmath91 which is non - convex due to the non - concavity of its objective function .",
    "however , by observing the fact that if @xmath92 is the solution of ( p1-s ) , so is @xmath93 for any arbitrary @xmath94 , we thus assume without loss of generality that @xmath95 is a real number and modify ( p1-s ) by rewriting its objective function as @xmath96 and adding an additional linear constraint @xmath97 . thereby , ( p1-s ) can be converted into a second - order cone programming ( socp ) @xcite problem , which is convex and thus can be efficiently solved by available convex optimization softwares @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ( p1-s ) can be shown equivalent to its lagrange dual problem @xcite , which is a convex semi - definite programming ( sdp ) @xcite problem and is thus efficiently solvable @xcite . for ( p1-s ) in the case of one single - antenna pu , a closed - form solution for the optimal precoding vector @xmath92 was derived in @xcite via a geometric approach .    in order to reveal the structure of the optimal @xmath11 for ( p1 )",

    "accordingly , an iterative algorithm can be developed to solve ( p1-d ) by alternating between solving @xmath103 for a given @xmath104 and updating @xmath104 to minimize @xmath103 . at each iteration",

    ", it follows that @xmath109 is the solution of the following equivalent problem ( by discarding irrelevant constant terms ) : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a constant matrix for a given @xmath104 . in order to solve problem ( [ eq : max p1 ] ) ,",
    "we introduce an auxiliary variable : @xmath112 .",

    "thus , the solution of problem ( [ eq : max p1 ] ) for a given @xmath104 can be expressed as @xmath123 .",
    "next , we present a heuristic method for solving ( p1 ) , which leads to a suboptimal solution in general and could serve as a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of the above two approaches based on convex optimization . to gain some intuitions for this method , we first take a look at two special cases of ( p1 ) . for the first case",
    ", supposing that all the pipcs are inactive ( e.g. , by setting @xmath124 ) and thus can be removed , ( p1 ) reduces to the standard mimo channel capacity optimization problem under the ptpc only , for which the optimal solution of @xmath11 is known to be derivable from the svd of @xmath86 @xcite . for the second case , assuming that @xmath125 , the solution for ( p1 ) is then obtained by the `` zero - forcing ( zf ) '' algorithm @xcite , which first projects @xmath86 into the space orthogonal to all @xmath126 s , and then designs the optimal @xmath127 based on the svd of the projected channel . note that the ( non - trivial ) zf - based solution exists only when @xmath128 . from the above two special cases",
    ", we observe that as @xmath69 s decrease , the optimal @xmath11 should evolve along with a sequence of subspaces of @xmath86 with decreasing dimensions as a result of keeping certain orthogonality to @xmath126 s , which motivates a new design method for cognitive beamforming , named as _ partial channel projection _ @xcite .",

    "* cr mimo - mac * : the solutions proposed for the cr point - to - point mimo channel shed insights to transmit optimization for the cr mimo - mac defined in ( [ eq : mac ] ) with @xmath154 .",
    "assume that in the cr mimo - mac , the optimal multiuser detection is deployed at the s - bs to successively decode different su messages from the received sum - signal .",
    "we then consider the problem for jointly optimizing su transmit covariance matrices to maximize their weighted sum - rate subject to individual ptpcs and joint pipcs .",

    "specifically , the wsrmax problem for the cr mimo - bc can be formulated as : @xmath159 where @xmath160 denotes the covariance matrix for the transmitted signal of s - bs intended for the @xmath26th su , @xmath27 ; @xmath161 s are the given user rate weights ; and @xmath153 denotes the transmit power constraint for the s - bs . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath162 ; thus , in ( p3 ) the optimal encoding order of users for dpc to maximize the weighted sum - rate is in accordance with the user index @xcite . note that ( p3 ) is non - convex with or without the pipcs due to the fact that the objective function is non - concave over @xmath163 s for @xmath164 . as a result , unlike ( p1 ) for the point - to - point cr channel , the standard lagrange duality method can not be applied for this problem . for ( p3 ) in the case without the pipcs , a so - called `` bc - mac duality '' relationship was proposed in @xcite to transform the non - convex mimo - bc problem into an equivalent convex mimo - mac problem , which is solvable by efficient convex optimization techniques such as the interior point method . in @xcite , another form of bc - mac duality , the so - called `` mini - max duality '' was explored to solve the mimo - bc problem under a special case of gltcc : the per - antenna transmit power constraint . however , these existing forms of bc - mac duality are yet unable to handle the case with arbitrary numbers of gltccs , which is the case for ( p3 ) with both the ptpc and pipcs .    in @xcite ,",

    "the optimal user transmit covariance solutions for the mimo - mac , @xmath180 s , can be transformed to the corresponding ones for the original mimo - bc , @xmath177 s , via a mac - bc covariance transformation algorithm given in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that with @xmath83 , the above method can be shown equivalent to that developed for ( p1 ) in the cr point - to - point mimo channel case based on the lagrange duality .",

    "the above technique has also been applied in @xcite for ( p4 ) without the pipcs .",
    "the sinr balancing problem for the conventional miso - bc without the pipcs has also been studied in @xcite , where an algorithm was proposed using the virtual uplink formulation and a fixed - point iteration . however",
    ", this algorithm can not be extended directly to deal with multiple pipcs for the case of cr miso - bc .",
    "similarly as for the previous discussions on the wsrmax problem for the cr mimo - bc where a generalized mimo mac - bc duality holds , a counterpart beamforming duality also holds for the miso - bc and simo - mac @xcite . with this duality result ,",
    "the sinr balancing problem ( p4 ) for the cr miso - bc can be converted into an equivalent problem for the dual simo - mac , where the efficient iterative algorithm in @xcite can be directly applied .",

    "* cr mimo - ic * : second , consider the cr mimo - ic given in ( [ eq : ic ] ) , subject to both the ptpcs for the @xmath20 su - txs and the pipcs for the @xmath21 pus , which can be similarly defined as for the mac case in ( [ eq : ptpc ] ) and ( [ eq : pipc ] ) , respectively . from an information - theoretic perspective , the capacity region for the gaussian ic under ptpcs , which consists of all the simultaneously achievable rates of all the users , still remains unknown in general even for the case of @xmath191 and @xmath192 @xcite . a pragmatic approach that leads to suboptimal achievable rates in the gaussian ic is to restrict the system to operate in a decentralized manner , i.e. , allowing only single - user encoding and decoding by treating the co - channel interferences from the other users as additional gaussian noises .",
    "for this approach , transmit optimization for the cr mimo - ic reduces to finding a set of optimal transmit covariance matrices for the @xmath20 su links , denoted by @xmath193 , to maximize the secondary network throughput under both the ptpcs and pipcs .",
    "more specifically , the wsrmax problem for the cr mimo - ic can be expressed as : @xmath194 where @xmath161 s are the given non - negative user rate weights .",
    "we see that ( p5 ) is non - convex with or without the pipcs due to the fact that the objective function is non - concave over @xmath195 s for @xmath154 . as a result , there are no efficient algorithms yet to obtain the globally optimal solution for this problem . for the same problem setup , there have been recent progresses on characterizing the maximum achievable `` degrees of freedom ( dof ) '' for the user sum - rate ( i.e. , @xmath196 ) @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss some feasible solutions for ( p5 ) .",
    "first , it is worth noting that for ( p5 ) in the case without the pipcs , a commonly adopted suboptimal approach is to iteratively optimize each user s transmit covariance subject to its individual ptpc with the transmit covariances of all the other users fixed .",
    "this decentralized approach has been first proposed in @xcite to obtain some local optimal points for ( p5 ) with the ptpcs only , where they differ in that the one in @xcite maximizes the user individual rate at each iteration , while the one in @xcite maximizes the user weighted sum - rate .",
    "it is also noted that a parallel line of works with similar iterative user optimizations has been pursued in the single - antenna but multi - carrier based interference channels such as the wired discrete - multi - tone ( dmt ) based digital subscriber line ( dsl ) network @xcite , and the wireless ofdm based ad hoc network @xcite .",
    "one important question to answer for such iterative algorithms is under what conditions the algorithm will guarantee to converge to a local optimal point .",
    "this problem has been addressed in the contexts of both multi - carrier and multi - antenna based interference channels in , e.g. , @xcite , via game - theoretic approaches .",
    "however , the above iterative approach can not be applied directly to solve ( p5 ) with both the pipcs and ptpcs , since each pipc involves all the user transmit covariances and is thus not separable over the sus .",
    "thus , a feasible approach for ( p5 ) is to decompose each of the @xmath21 pipcs into a set of interference - power constraints over the @xmath20 su - txs , i.e. , for the @xmath50th pipc , @xmath70 , @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a constant , and all @xmath198 s , @xmath27 , satisfy @xmath199 such that the @xmath50th pipc is guaranteed .",
    "then , the iterative algorithm works here , where each su link independently optimizes @xmath195 to maximize its achievable rate under its ptpc and @xmath21 interference - power constraints given by ( [ eq : pipc ic ] ) , with all other @xmath200 s , @xmath201 , fixed .",
    "it is observed that the resulting problem is in the same form of our previously studied ( p1 ) for the cr point - point mimo channel ; thus , similar techniques developed for ( p1 ) can be applied .",
    "note that a suboptimal method for this problem in the same spirit of the partial channel projection method to reduce the design complexity for each su transmit covariance matrix has also been proposed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is noted that @xmath198 s , @xmath51 , @xmath27 , can be searched over the sus to further improve their weighted sum - rate .",
    "alternatively , assuming that a centralized optimization is feasible with the global knowledge of all the channels in the su network , as well as those from different su - txs to all pus , another heuristic algorithm for ( p5 ) was proposed in @xcite . by rewriting the su",
    "transmit covariance matrices into their equivalent precoding vectors and power allocation vectors , this algorithm iteratively updates the su transmit precoding vectors ( based on the `` network duality '' @xcite ) or the power allocation vectors ( by solving geometric programming ( gp ) problems @xcite ) , with the others being fixed .",
    "it is worth pointing out that there are other problem formulations different from ( p5 ) to address the transmit optimization for the cr mimo - ic . in @xcite ,",
    "a new criterion was proposed to design the su link transmission in a cr miso - ic via an alternative decentralized approach , where each su - tx independently designs its transmit precoding vector to maximize the ratio between the received signal power at the desired su - rx and the resulted total interference power at all the pus , in order to regulate the interference powers at pus .",
    "moreover , the above discussions are all based on the assumption that each su - rx treats the interferences from all the other su links as additional noises , which is of practical interest since it simplifies the receiver design for each su link .",
    "however , due to independent cross - link channels between su terminals , it may be possible that a su - rx could occasionally observe `` strong '' interference signals from some co - existing su - txs and thus be able to decode their messages via multiuser detection techniques and then cancel the associated interferences . with such `` opportunistic '' multiuser detection at each su - rx ,",
    "the achievable rate of each su link becomes a function of not only its own transmit covariance , but also those of the other sus as well as their instantaneous transmit rates .",
    "thus , the corresponding transmit optimization for the cr mimo - ic leads to new and more challenging problem formulations than ( p5 ) ; the interested readers may refer to @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the following two cases .",
    "for the first case , consider that @xmath207 is a concave function over @xmath219 $ ] s , @xmath220 ( e.g. , the point - to - point cr channel capacity in ( p1 ) , or the weighted sum - rate for the cr mimo - mac in ( p2 ) ) .",
    "then , ( p6 ) is convex and thus the duality gap between the optimal values of ( p6 ) and ( p6-d ) is zero , i.e. , ( p6 ) and ( p6-d ) are equivalent problems .",
    "furthermore , each subproblem in ( [ eq : subdual ] ) is also convex .",
    "thus , the dual decomposition method solves ( p6 ) via its dual problem ( p6-d ) , which is decomposable into @xmath57 convex subproblems .",
    "for the second case , as a counterpart , consider that @xmath207 is non - concave over @xmath219 $ ] s ( e.g. , the weighted sum - rate for the cr mimo - bc / mimo - ic in ( p3)/(p5 ) ) . as a result , ( p6 )",
    "is non - convex and the duality gap between ( p6 ) and ( p6-d ) may not be zero .",
    "furthermore , the subproblem ( [ eq : subdual ] ) is also non - convex . for this case",
    ", even when the optimal solutions of the @xmath57 subproblems are obtainable , the optimal value of ( p6-d ) in general only serves as an upper bound on that of ( p6 ) .",
    "however , in @xcite it is pointed out that if a set of so - called `` time - sharing '' conditions are satisfied by a non - convex optimization problem , the duality gap for this problem and its dual problem is indeed zero .",
    "furthermore , for the class of dra problems in the form of ( p6 ) , the associated time - sharing conditions are usually satisfied asymptotically as @xmath221 under some cautious considerations on the continuity of channel distributions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dual decomposition method could still be applied to solve ( p6 ) in the non - convex case for sufficiently large values of @xmath57 , provided that the optimal solutions for the subproblems in ( [ eq : subdual ] ) are obtainable ( e.g. , a variation of ( p3 ) for the cr mimo - bc ) . however , with finite values of @xmath57 , how to efficiently solve ( p6 ) in the case of non - concave objective functions is still open .    with the above discussions on the general approaches to design joint space - time - frequency dra for cr networks , we next present some examples of unique interests to cr systems .",
    "time-/frequency - division multiple - access ( tdma / fdma ) , which schedules only one user for transmission at each time / frequency dimension , is usually preferable in practice due to their implementation ease . for the tdma / fdma based cr mac ( similar arguments hold for the cr bc / ic ) ,",
    "the optimal dra over @xmath57 transmit dimensions to maximize the sum - capacity of the sus can be formulated as ( p6 ) with properly chosen functions for @xmath207 s , where for any given @xmath61 , @xmath207 is expressed as ( @xmath61 is dropped for conciseness ) @xmath222 note that @xmath223 defined above implies the tdma / fdma constraint , i.e. , only scheduling one user for transmission at a given dimension with a positive contribution to the sum - capacity .",
    "however , it can be shown that @xmath223 is non - concave over @xmath158 s in this case and as a result , the corresponding ( p6 ) is non - convex .",
    "nevertheless , according to our previous discussions , since the time - sharing conditions hold approximately when @xmath224 , the dual decomposition method can be applied to solve ( p6 ) for this case with very large values of @xmath57 , where the optimal solution of the associated subproblem at each dimension given in ( [ eq : subdual ] ) can be obtained by finding the su ( selected for transmission ) with the largest objective value of the following problem ( which is of the same form as problem ( [ eq : max p1 ] ) and thus solvable in a similar way ) : @xmath225    an important question to investigate for tdma / fdma based dra is how much the performance is degraded as compared with the optimal dra that allows more than one users to transmit at a given dimension . from an information - theoretic viewpoint ,",
    "it is thus pertinent to investigate the conditions for the optimality of tdma / fdma , i.e. , when they are optimal to achieve the system sum - capacity . for the traditional single - antenna fading mac under the user atpcs over time",
    ", it has been shown in @xcite that tdma is optimal for achieving the ergodic / long - term sum - capacity .",
    "this result has been shown to hold for the fading cr mac and cr bc under both the atpcs and aipcs in @xcite , where by exploiting the kkt optimality conditions of the associated optimization problems , the optimality conditions for tdma in other cases of combined peak / average transmit / interference power constraints have been characterized .",
    "for the traditional single - antenna ic with interference treated as noise , the optimality of tdma / fdma for the sum capacity has been investigated under the atpcs in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to extend these results to the case of cr ic under the additional pipcs and/or aipcs .",
    "from a su s perspective , it is obvious that the atpc / aipc is more flexible than the ptpc / pipc for dra under the same power threshold and thus results in a larger su link capacity .",
    "however , from a pu s perspective , it remains unknown whether the aipc or pipc causes more pu link performance degradation .",
    "intuitively speaking , the pipc should be more favorable than the aipc since the former limits the interference power at the pu to be below certain threshold at each time / frequency dimension , while the latter results in variations of interference power levels over different dimensions although their average level is kept below the same threshold as that for the pipc .",
    "somehow surprisingly , in @xcite it is shown that for the single - antenna pu fading channel subject to the interference from a su transmitter , the aipc is in fact better than its pipc counterpart under the same average power threshold in terms of minimizing the pu capacity losses , which holds for the cases of both ergodic and outage capacities of the pu channel , with / without power control . to illustrate this result",
    ", we consider for simplicity the case without the pu link power control , i.e. , the pu transmits with a constant power , @xmath226 , over all the fading states .",
    "suppose that the pu link channel power gain is denoted by @xmath227 , and that from the su transmitter to the pu receiver denoted by @xmath228 .",
    "next , consider the following two cases , where the interference power from the su transmitter at the pu receiver , denoted by @xmath229 , with @xmath230 denoting the su transmit power , is fixed over all the fading states in case i ( corresponding to the case of pipc ) , and is allowed to be variable in case ii ( corresponding to the case of aipc ) .",
    "for both cases , a constant interference power threshold @xmath231 is set and is assumed to hold with equality , i.e. , for case i , @xmath232 , for all the fading states , while for case ii , @xmath233 . taking the pu ergodic capacity as an example , which can be expressed as ( assuming unit - power receiver gaussian noise ) : @xmath234 let @xmath235 and @xmath236 denote the values of @xmath237 in cases i and ii , respectively .",
    "the following equalites / inequalities then hold @xmath238 where ( [ eq:1 ] ) is due to the jensen s inequality ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the convexity of the function @xmath239 where @xmath240 is any positive constant and @xmath241 . thus , it follows that given the same average power of the interference , @xmath231 , it is desirable for the pu to have the instantaneous interference power @xmath242 fluctuate over fading states ( case ii ) rather than stay constant ( case i ) , to achieve a larger ergodic capacity .    in general",
    ", the results in @xcite reveal a new _ interference diversity _",
    "phenomenon for ss - based cr networks , i.e. , the randomized interference powers from the secondary network can be more advantageous over deterministic ones across different transmit dimensions over space , time , or frequency for minimizing the resulted primary network capacity losses .",
    "further investigations are required on interference diversity driven dra for cr or other spectrum sharing systems .",
    "so far , we have studied dra for cr networks based on the it constraints for protecting the pu transmissions .",
    "given that the it constraints in general conservatively lead to an upper bound on the pu capacity loss due to the interference from the sus @xcite , it would be possible to improve the spectrum sharing capacities for both the sus and pus over the it - based methods if additional cognition on the pu transmissions is available at the cr transmitters .",
    "for example , by exploiting csi of the pu links , the crs could allocate transmit / interference powers more flexibly over the dimensions where the pu channels exhibit poor conditions , without degrading too much the pu link performances .",
    "these pu `` null '' dimensions could come up in time , frequency , or space .",
    "thus , the it constraints could be replaced by the more relevant _ primary link performance margin constraints _ @xcite for the design of dra in cr networks , in order to optimally exploit the available primary link performance margins to accommodate the interference from the sus . following this new paradigm , many new and challenging dra problems can be formulated for cr networks .",
    "as an example , consider the same setup with a pair of single - antenna pu and su links over fading channels as in the previous subsection . instead of applying the conventional aipc : @xmath243 , over the su power allocation , we may apply the following pu ergodic capacity constraint @xcite @xmath244 where @xmath245 is a given threshold for the minimum pu ergodic capacity .",
    "note that the new constraint in ( [ eq : pu loss constraint ] ) is more directly related to the pu transmission than the conventional aipc .",
    "however , it can be verified that the constraint in ( [ eq : pu loss constraint ] ) is non - convex over @xmath230 in general , thus resulting in more challenging su power allocation problems than that with the convex aipc .",
    "the optimal power allocation rules for the su link subject to the aipc vs. the newly introduced pu ergodic capacity constraint given by ( [ eq : pu loss constraint ] ) are compared in @xcite , where it is shown that the new constraint achieves notable rate improvements for both the pu and su links over the conventional aipc .",
    "dynamic resource allocation ( dra ) has become an essential building block in cr networks to exploit various cognitions over both the primary and secondary networks for cr transmit optimization subject to certain required primary protection . in this article",
    ", we have presented an extensive list of new , challenging , and unique problems for designing the optimal dra in cr networks , and demonstrated the key role of various convex optimization techniques in solving the associated design problems .",
    "in addition to those open issues as highlighted in our previous discussions , other promising areas of practical and theoretical interests are discussed as follows , which open an avenue for future work .",
    "_ robust cognitive beamforming _ : in our previous discussions on cognitive beamforming , we have observed that the knowledge of channels from each secondary transmitting terminal to all pus is essential to the design optimization .",
    "however , since the primary and secondary networks usually belong to different operators , it is difficult for the pus to feed back the required csi to the crs . as a result",
    ", the su usually needs to rely on its own observations over the received signals from the primary terminals to extract the required csi @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the estimated csi on the su - to - pu channels may contain errors , which should be taken into account for the design of practical cr systems .",
    "this motivates a new and challenging research direction on robust designs for cognitive beamforming to cope with imperfect csi @xcite .",
    "more investigations on the robust cognitive beamforming designs for more general cr networks and csi uncertainty models are appealing .    _",
    "active interference - temperature control _ : in this article , we have focused on the design of cr networks subject to the given interference - power constraints for protecting the pus .",
    "we have also discussed some promising rules on how to optimally set the it constraints in the cr network to achieve the best spectrum sharing throughput .",
