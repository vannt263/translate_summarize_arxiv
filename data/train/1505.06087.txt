    "cool main - sequence and sub - giant ( i.e. , solar - type ) stars display solar - like oscillations , pulsations that are stochastically excited and intrinsically damped by near - surface convection .",
    "the solar - like excitation mechanism gives rise to a rich spectrum of detectable oscillations .",
    "data on global ( or average ) asteroseismic parameters associated with the observed , rich oscillations spectra provide important diagnostics of fundamental stellar properties . extracting these global parameters from oscillation spectra is usually very straightforward , meaning a large number of stars can easily be analysed",
    ". this can be particularly advantagous when low s / n ratios either obstruct or prevent a more detailed analysis of individual modes in the spectrum .",
    "moreover , detailed analysis of stars with high s / n or complicated oscillation spectra can be very time consuming .",
    "two global asteroseismic parameters have received particular attention , and wide use .",
    "one parameter is the average large frequency separation , @xmath6 .",
    "it is an average of the observed frequency spacings between consecutive overtones @xmath7 of the same angular ( spherical ) degree , @xmath8 .",
    "the average large separation scales to a very good approximation as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mean density of a star of mass @xmath11 and surface radius @xmath12 ( e.g. see tassoul 1980 , ulrich 1986 , christensen - dalsgaard 1993 ) .",
    "this scaling has physical justification ( e.g. , see reese et al .",
    "the second parameter , @xmath0 , is the frequency at which detected modes of a star show the strongest amplitude .",
    "brown et al . ( 1991 ) speculated that this characteristic frequency might scale with the atmospheric cut - off frequency for acoustic waves , @xmath13 . adopting an isothermal approximation to the full equation describing the cut - off frequency ,",
    "one derives the scaling @xmath14 ( brown et al .",
    "1991 , kjeldsen & bedding 1995 ) .",
    "numerous studies have shown empirically that @xmath0 appears to follow this relation to reasonable approximation ( e.g. , chaplin & miglio 2013 and references therein ) . while some headway has been made on understanding the exact form of the scaling ( e.g. , belkacem et al .",
    "2011 ) , a full theoretical justification remains elusive .",
    "additions to the scaling , for example a dependence on the changing mach number of the near - surface turbulent flow ( belkacem et al .",
    "2013 ) , have also been proposed .",
    "information encoded in @xmath6 and @xmath0 is commonly exploited by using the above scaling dependencies normalized to observed solar parameters or properties , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath16 typical solar values for the seismic parameters ( e.g. , see chaplin et al .",
    "2014 ) are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these solar - calibrated scaling relations represent two equations in two unknowns when an estimate of @xmath5 is also available , allowing us to solve directly for @xmath11 and @xmath12 to give so - called `` direct '' estimates of the stellar properties .",
    "moreover , each relation can be used independently to provide direct estimates of the mean stellar density @xmath19 ( equation  [ eq : dnu ] ) or the surface gravity @xmath20 ( equation  [ eq : numax ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the relations may be utilized ( together or separately ) as part of a grid - based search code . here",
    ", one searches amongst a grid of stellar evolutionary models to find those models whose predicted asteroseismic or atmospheric parameters match the actual observed parameters ( at the level of the observational uncertainties ) .",
    "the solar - calibrated relations provide the means to translate model properties ( @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath5 ) to expected values for @xmath6 and @xmath0 , thereby allowing a comparison to be made with the observations .",
    "these global asteroseismic parameters and their associated scaling relations are now being employed in analyses of large samples of solar - like oscillators to , for example , generate catalogues of asteroseismic stellar properties ( e.g. , see huber et al .",
    "2013 , chaplin et al .",
    "2014 , casagrande et al .",
    "2014 , pinsonneault et al .",
    "tests in the literature of the scaling relations for solar - type stars have , by and large , returned encouraging results .",
    "studies have most commonly looked at data on estimated stellar radii , and include comparisons with very accurate properties from binaries , parallaxes and long baseline interferometry ( e.g. , bruntt et al .",
    "2010 , bedding 2011 , miglio 2012 , huber et al .",
    "2012 , silva aguirre et al .",
    "2012 , white et al .",
    "results have tested the combination of the two scaling relations to levels of around 4per cent in inferred radii , and 10per cent in inferred masses ( chaplin et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "results on red giants are more complicated .",
    "for example , he - core burning and h - shell burning giants with the same mass and radius can have a different @xmath6 , due to differences in the sound - speed profile in the outer layers ( miglio et al .",
    "2012 ) , which implies a different absolute scaling for equation  [ eq : dnu ] .",
    "meanwhile , other studies have looked at open clusters in the _ kepler _ field , comparing results on red giants inferred from asteroseismology and from turnoff eclipsing binaries ( brogaard et al .",
    "2012 , sandquist et al .",
    "2013 ) .    our goal in this paper it to test , empirically , the accuracy of the classic @xmath0 scaling relation for oscillations seen in solar - type stars , i.e. , cool main - sequence and sub - giant stars ( we leave a study of giants to future work ) .",
    "there is actually very little in the literature on the @xmath0 scaling alone , which partly reflects the difficulty of obtaining the data needed to test the one relation in isolation .",
    "a recent example made use of interferometric data on a few very bright _ kepler _ targets : white et al .",
    "( 2013 ) concluded that results on the f - type star @xmath21cyg may point to problems for the @xmath0 scaling in the hottest solar - type stars .",
    "our basic approach is as follows .",
    "we use data on a sample of around 500 stars observed by the nasa _ kepler _ mission ( the same sample as in chaplin et al .",
    "each star in our sample has a measured @xmath0 , which comes from analysis of the _ kepler _ data .",
    "throughout the rest of the paper we shall refer to these actual , measured values as @xmath22 .",
    "now , the classic scaling relation ( equation  [ eq : numax ] ) gives @xmath0 in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath5 , or , to be more specific , the combination @xmath23 .",
    "we can therefore test the scaling if we have independent measures of @xmath24 to which the observed @xmath22 may be compared .",
    "the @xmath25 are so - named because we adopt a grid - based search technique to estimate them , using as inputs the asteroseismic average large separations , @xmath6 , of the stars along with photometric temperatures , @xmath5 , derived using the infrared flux method ( irfm ) and , where available , metallicities [ fe / h ] from spectroscopy .",
    "we search grids of stellar evolutionary models to find those models whose predicted @xmath26 } \\}$ ] match the actual observed inputs . each model in the grid also has a computed @xmath25 , which comes from its @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath5 .",
    "the best - matching models will have the most likely values of @xmath25 .",
    "a suitable , likelihood - weighted average therefore provides an estimate of @xmath25 for every star ( see section  [ sec : pipes ] ) , which may then be compared directly to the observed @xmath22 .",
    "any departures from a one - to - one correspondance of the values would point to problems with the classic scaling relation , and allow us to quantify departures from the scaling . in sum , we leverage the potential of using asteroseismic results on a large number of solar - type stars to follow a statistical ( ensemble ) approach to the analysis and to thereby beat - down the errors . the approach is not dissimilar to",
    "that adopted by morel et al .",
    "( 2014 ) for part of their analysis of red giants observed by the cnes / esa corot mission , which compared values of the surface gravity estimated using @xmath6 on the one hand and @xmath0 on the other .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : method ] with a discussion of the basic methodology adopted to test the @xmath0 scaling relation .",
    "section  [ sec : dataandgrid ] then introduces the real _ kepler _ data , the artificial data we made to check our methodology ( section  [ sec : data ] ) , and the grid - based search pipelines used to estimate the @xmath25 values ( section  [ sec : pipes ] ) .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] , beginning with a validation of the methodology using artificial data ( section  [ sec : artres ] ) , followed by results from the actual _ kepler _ sample .",
    "we finish in section  [ sec : conc ] with concluding remarks .",
    "we may in principle use some suitable grid - based results to test the @xmath0 scaling relation , albeit with caveats that we will discuss and address below .",
    "let us suppose for the moment that grid - based searches using the set of inputs @xmath27 } \\}\\ ] ] provide robust , unbiased estimates of the combination @xmath28 , as calibrated to give @xmath25 defined by equation  [ eq : nug ] above .",
    "assuming the temperatures and metallicities to be unbiased , at least to a level that will not influence significantly estimation of the combination @xmath28 , the fractional differences @xmath29 -1,\\ ] ] will provide a direct estimate of the bias in the @xmath0 scaling , i.e. , the fractional amount by which the @xmath30 values are over or underestimated relative to @xmath31 .",
    "crucial to the approach is the accuracy of @xmath32 .",
    "first , we know to expect a small bias if the grid - based search pipelines employ the @xmath6 scaling relation , as we now go on to explain",
    ". when the scaling relation is used in the grid - based searches , the fundamental properties of models in the grid are used as inputs to equation  [ eq : dnu ] to yield model estimates of @xmath6 for comparison with the observed separations .",
    "alternatively , one may circumvent use of the scaling by computing for each model a set of theoretical oscillation frequencies ( e.g. , radial - mode frequencies spanning the same orders as those observed in the real data ) , from which one may then estimate the required @xmath6 from a suitable fit to those frequencies .",
    "it is now well known that predictions made by the calibrated scaling - relation ( equation  [ eq : dnu ] ) have small , systematic differences with respect to predictions from model - computed frequencies ( e.g. , see ulrich 1986 , white et al .",
    "2011 ; mosser et al .",
    "2013 ) . for solar - type stars",
    ", these differences can be up to @xmath33 in size , and become more pronounced at effective temperatures progressively further away from @xmath34 ( e.g. , see figures 5 and 6 of white et al .",
    "2011 ; and figures in chaplin et al .",
    "2014 ) . here , we have employed grid - based search pipelines that can run with or without the @xmath6 scaling relation .",
    "we use one pipeline that may be run either using individual model - calculated frequencies or the @xmath6 scaling relation ; and , for comparison , two other pipelines that used the @xmath6 scaling only .",
    "second , we must consider the impact of the poor modelling of the near - surface layers of stars . in the case of the sun",
    "it is now well established that this gives rise to a frequency - dependent offset between observed and model - calculated oscillation frequencies ( e.g. , see chaplin & miglio 2013 , and references therein ) .",
    "this so - called `` surface term '' increases in magnitude with increasing overtone number , @xmath7 .",
    "the amount by which @xmath6 is affected will depend on the variation of the surface term with @xmath7 .",
    "tests of the grid - based method ( basu et al . 2010 ) indicate that the impact of the solar surface term on @xmath6  which decreases the observed solar @xmath6 by just under 1per cent compared to model predictions  leads only to very small errors in the inferred solar properties , certainly well within the observational uncertainties associated with the _ kepler _ data used in this paper .",
    "stellar surface terms would need to be substantially larger than the solar term to produce significant bias in our results .",
    "however , the nature of the term in other stars remains rather poorly understood , and so this caveat should be borne in mind .",
    "our tests with artificial data do nevertheless provide some insights on the sensitivity of the results to such offsets .",
    "the artificial data come from models computed using a different stellar evolutionary code and different input physics to those of the grids to which the grid - based pipelines are coupled",
    ". this can give rise to `` surface - term '' like offsets between models in the artificial sample in the grids that share the same fundamental properties ( in particular from differences in boundary conditions , matching to model atmospheres etc . ) .",
    "the observational data for our study come from chaplin et al .",
    "this study produced an asteroseismic catalogue from an extensive grid - based analysis of more than 500 solar - like oscillators , which were observed by _",
    "kepler _ as part of an asteroseismic survey that was conducted over the first 10months of science operations .",
    "stellar properties were estimated from a grid - based analysis using the global asteroseismic parameters @xmath6 and @xmath0 together with complementary photometric and spectroscopic data as the inputs .",
    "homogeneous sets of effective temperatures @xmath5 were available for the full sample of stars , courtesy of complementary ground - based photometry .",
    "a homogeneous set of spectroscopic parameters ( @xmath5 and [ fe / h ] ) was also available from bruntt et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , but only for a subset of 87 stars in the sample    here , we make use of the global asteroseismic parameters and the complementary data to perform the new grid - based analysis needed to test the @xmath0 scaling relation . the chaplin et al .",
    "( 2014 ) sample is dominated by cool main - sequence and sub - giant stars but does contain a small fraction of stars at the base of the red - giant branch that were serendipitously observed as part of the short - cadence asteroseismic survey .",
    "we have removed the more evolved stars from the sample ( which will be the subject of a separate study ) .",
    "the selected sample contains 426 solar - type stars .",
    "as noted above , complementary photometry was available on the entire sample .",
    "this allowed us to perform a new , homogenous grid - based analysis on all the selected solar - type stars , but at the cost of not having robust , well - constrained estimates of [ fe / h ] for each star since the complementary photometry available to us in the _ kepler _ input catalogue ( kic ; see brown et al .",
    "2011 ) does not provide strong constraints on metallicity . just like chaplin et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we therefore adopted an average [ fe / h ] value as input for every star when we analysed the 426-star sample .",
    "we actually tried two different values : one set of results came from using the average of the 87 metallicities measured by bruntt et al .",

    "( 2014 ) . in both cases we adopted large input uncertainties of @xmath37 .    in spite of the weak constraints on [ fe / h ]",
    ", we still obtained more precise results from the larger 426-star sample having complementary photometric data than we did from the smaller sample with complementary spectroscopic data because the larger sample size compensated for the inferior precision in [ fe / h ] .",
    "results obtained were similar , and hence in what follows we present detailed results from the photometric sample .",
    "this sample also provided much better coverage in the domain where @xmath38 .    finally with regards to the input data ,",

    "[ fig : hr ] marks the locations of the selected models in our artificial sample of stars ( using the pristine model parameters ) .",
    "owing to the limited resolution of the grid , we found that some real stars had the same best - matching artificial model .",
    "this meant that our final sample of selected artificial stars was comprised of 306 unique models .",
    "next , we computed adiabatic oscillation frequencies for each of the 306 selected models , using the gyre ( townsend & teitler 2013 ) stellar oscillations code .",
    "the @xmath6 of each artificial star was then given by the best - fitting gradient of a linear fit to the radial order , @xmath7 , of the five @xmath50 frequencies centred on the estimated @xmath0 ( see below ) of the model .",
    "this approach gives values that are representative of the average values extracted from the real data .",
    "we also tested the impact of calculating @xmath6 using a different number of orders ( to reflect the varying data quality and s / n levels in the real sample of stars ) and from adopting a weighted fit of the frequencies ( to reflect the impact of the changing s / n in any given observed spectrum ) .",
    "neither change had a significant impact on our results .",
    "we computed three different sets of @xmath0 for the artificial sample .",
    "one set was computed assuming perfect adherence to the solar - calibrated scaling relation , i.e. , by using equation  [ eq : numax ] .",

    "we applied a linear and quadratic offset , respectively , both of which are shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : art3 ] ( in the figure that also shows results from the data ; see below for further discussion ) . use of the first set of `` perfect '' values allowed us to test the impact of biases not associated with the @xmath0 scaling relation ; while the other sets allowed us to test whether we could recover information on a known bias in the @xmath0 scaling .",
    "finally , with each artificial star then having calculated values of @xmath6 and @xmath0 , and a model @xmath5 , it remained to add noise and to assign uncertainties to those parameters for input to the grid pipelines .",
    "this meant that in our analysis we would treat the artificial data in exactly the same way as the real data . here",
    ", we simply used the relevant parameter uncertainties of the real _ kepler _ star to which each artificial star was associated . to make a given realization of the artificial datasets ,",

    "the yb pipeline determines the properties of a star using the given observational input ( central ) parameter set .",

    "we may therefore rule out departures from a @xmath28 scaling at the level of @xmath3 over the full @xmath63 range tested in @xmath5 .    as noted in section  [ sec : intro ] , the scaling relations ( equations  [ eq : dnu ] and  [ eq : numax ] ) may be manipulated to give expressions for the stellar radius , @xmath12 , and mass , @xmath11 .",
    "the dependencies of the resulting expressions imply that any bias in @xmath0 propagates to give bias in the inferred properties of @xmath64 and @xmath65 departures from the classic scaling of @xmath3 across the full range ( see above ) therefore fix 1-@xmath55 upper limits on changes in any bias in inferred properties with changing @xmath5 of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "[ fig : art1 ] , we see a systemetic shift in the absolute offset , from just over 3per cent for an input [ fe / h ] of @xmath76 to around 4per cent for an input [ fe / h ] of @xmath75 . assuming that the overall shift results from the quadratic addition of uncorrelated effects , this implies a systematic shift due to the uncertainty in [ fe / h ] of around 2.5per cent .",
    "it is worth noting that if we analyse the smaller sample of real stars having spectroscopic data from bruntt et al .",
    "( 2012 )  which have much more tightly constrained input [ fe / h ]  we get the same @xmath77per cent offset as the @xmath76 full - sample case .",
    "accounting for the above still leaves us with an uncertainty in the absolute calibration of around 3per cent ( again , assuming that the contributions are uncorrelated ) .",
    "we recall from discussions in previous sections that we would expect this to reflect differences between the physics and structures of the real stars ( including near - surface effects ) and those of the grid models .",
    "an analysis performed on @xmath71-wide bins finds no evidence for any significant deviation of the offset with @xmath78 .",
    "the results imply that if there are any absolute errors in the calibration , all inferred properties will be biased by the _ same _ fractional amount .",
