    "several experiments are underway to detect the stochastic gravitational background from early universe cosmology .",
    "these gravity waves ( gws ) propagate almost freely throughout the entire history of the universe and thus can be a direct source of information about the universe at very early times .",
    "one source of gws is inflation @xcite , a superluminal growth phase of the universe which can explain the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe as well as the generation of density perturbations required for structure formation .",
    "there are two types of contributions to gw from inflation . in slowly rolling models , quantum fluctuations of space - time lead to contributions proportional to the height of the inflaton potential . in tunneling models , where the inflation ends in a first order phase transition",
    ", there is an additional contribution due to bubble collisions of true vacuum bubbles at the end of the phase transition @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will present the possible gravitational wave signatures that advanced ligo could detect originating from vacuum bubble collisions in inflationary models that end in a rapid tunneling event .",
    "there are two widely different origins of gw from inflationary cosmology .",
    "the most commonly studied are those due to quantum fluctuations of the inflation field in slowly rolling models of inflation .",
    "whereas the scalar modes of the fluctuations produce density perturbations that seed structure formation , the tensor modes produce gravity waves .",
    "these gw are on very large scale lengths , comparable to the present - day horizon scale .",
    "cosmic microwave background experiments can in principle search for these gw . the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and planck satellites have not found gw yet but instead place bounds on their contribution to the energy density of the universe .",
    "specifically , wmap bounds gw in the range of frequencies @xmath5 @xcite at the level of roughly @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the fraction of the universe s ( critical ) energy density in the form of gw .",
    "the bounds from planck are currently only slightly better but should improve once the polarization data is analyzed @xcite .",
    "most recently , the bicep2 experiment has claimed detection of gravitational waves at frequencies @xmath8 hz @xcite .",
    "bicep2 measured the tensor to scalar ratio with a mean value @xmath9 at a pivot scale @xmath10 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "a tensor to scalar ratio @xmath9 implies that @xmath12 . at first glance ,",
    "the results on the value of the tensor to scalar ratio from wmap and planck seem to contradict those of bicep2 .",
    "there have been many different proposals to alleviate the tension between wmap / planck and bicep2 , such as allowing for the running of the scalar spectral index @xcite , the inclusion of sterile neutrino contributions @xcite , and other considerations @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of dust polarization maps to the bicep2 data could also explain the discrepancy between experiments @xcite .",
    "the polarization data from the planck experiment , expected to be released in the near future , will be an important test in collaborating bicep2 s claim of detection .",
    "proposed for the future is cmbpol , which would have a sensitivity at least an order of magnitude better than existing cmb experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the second possible origin of gw from inflation , bubble collisions in tunneling models of inflation that end in a first order phase transition .",
    "the physical signatures of these bubbles are on much smaller length scales .",
    "adv ligo can be used to test gw densities due to bubble collisions roughly in the range of @xmath13 and is sensitive up to @xmath14 .",
    "the current @xmath15 upper bound of ligo s5 is around @xmath16 in the frequency band @xmath17-@xmath18 hz .",
    "consequently ligo s5 has not been able to test any of the first order phase transitions studied in this paper @xcite .",
    "the largest amplitude considered is approximately @xmath19 as will be shown in the results section .",
    "ligo s6 has also gathered data , but its bounds are very similar to those of ligo s5 and thus would also not be able to elucidate on the first order phase transition considered here .",
    "proposed for the more distant future are the space - interferometers bbo and decigo , with possible launch within @xmath20 or @xmath21 years @xcite@xcite .",
    "we also wish to mention previous wok on bubble collisions in a _",
    "thermal _ background ; i.e. the bubbles nucleate in a radiation dominated background , rather than in the vacuum dominated background of inflationary transitions .",
    "thermal bubbles differ from vacuum bubbles in that they have extra structure such as turbulence which produce relevant signatures @xcite .",
    "another source of gravitational waves that has captured much interest in recent years is preheating , which also has an elaborate structure due to the thermal background @xcite .",
    "while all of this work on bubble collisions in a thermal background is very interesting it does not apply to the vacuum bubbles from inflation studied here .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our studies to bubble collisions in inflationary models with one single tunneling event . in future work",
    "we will turn to the possibility of multiple tunneling events such as seen in chain inflation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine if adv ligo would be able to measure the gw energy spectrum of single phase transition tunneling models ; and if so , which region of the parameter space they would be able to  see \" .",
    "in tunneling models of inflation , the universe starts out in a high - energy minimum and then tunnels down to its global minimum . during the time spent in the  false \" vacuum",
    ", the universe expands superluminally by @xmath22 60 ( or so ) @xmath23-folds required to resolve the flatness problem .",
    "there are two competing factors which constrain single - phase transition model building : the horizon / flatness problems on the one hand and percolation on the other . in order to explain the lack of intrinsic curvature of the universe",
    ", a grand unified ( gut ) scale inflationary model needs the universe to inflate by approximately 60 @xmath23-folds .",
    "thus , it is necessary for the universe to stay in the  false \" minimum long enough to expand @xmath24 times its original size . on the other hand ,",
    "the phase transition needs to be rapid enough such that bubbles of true vacuum intersect one another and percolation is complete .",
    "both criteria can be met if we introduce a time - dependent nucleation rate @xmath25 , which gives the probability per physical volume per time that a bubble will be produced in a region still in the  false \" minimum .",
    "the failure of  old \" inflation ( guth s ( 1981 ) original inflation model @xcite ) was due primarily to assuming a constant nucleation rate .",
    "old inflation produced a ` swiss cheese universe ' : to allow for sufficient inflation , the tunneling rate had to be so slow that the phase transition was never able to complete @xcite . at the end of inflation",
    "most of the universe remained in a state of false vacuum but contained disconnected bubbles of true vacuum .",
    "the bubbles of true vacuum were unable to merge together sufficiently to percolate and thermalize , as would be required for an end to inflation .",
    "as a solution to this problem adams and freese ( 1991 ) as well as linde ( 1990 ) suggested models with a time - dependent tunneling rate .",
    "the tunneling rate starts out very slow , so that sufficient inflation can take place ; and then suddenly the tunneling rate becomes very fast so that the phase transition quickly percolates and completes , allowing for a universe consisting entirely of true vacuum .",
    "the time dependence of the nucleation rate has been proposed by adams and freese ( 1991 ) and by linde ( 1990 ) to arise from multi - field interactions @xcite .",
    "equivalently ( using different terminology ) in a multi - dimensional potential , at first the field slowly rolls in one field direction for at least 60 e - folds of inflation , and after that tunnels rapidly in a different field direction to complete the phase transition .",
    "cort@xmath26s and liddle ( 2009 ) studied these models in light of wmap data and concluded they are still viable @xcite .",
    "this paper applies to any inflationary model that ends in a first order phase transition .",
    "other examples besides the double - field model mentioned above include models with a scalar field non - minimally coupled to gravity @xcite@xcite .",
    "the nucleation rate of true vacuum bubbles in the sea of false vacuum is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the action for the bounce solution extrapolating between false and true vacua and a is a determinant constant with units of [ mass]@xmath29 @xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we follow the work of c. caprini , r. durrer and g. servant ( 2007 ) and expand our action to first order around @xmath30 , which will be defined below as the time when the universe became @xmath31 true vacuum .",
    "thus , the nucleation rate can be expressed as @xmath32 here @xmath33 is a parameter whose inverse sets a rough time scale for the phase transition to complete in our inflationary model ( more accurately see equation [ 9 ] below ) @xcite .",
    "the probability of a point staying in the false vacuum , @xmath34 , can be calculated from the nucleation rate : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the scale factor of the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker metric .",
    "a bubble nucleated at time @xmath39 grows to have a radius @xmath40 at a later time @xmath41 given by @xmath42 where we have assumed that the wall of the bubbles expand at the speed of light @xmath43 , and will take @xmath44 for all future calculations .",
    "if we further assume that the phase transition occurs fast enough that we can neglect the expansion of the universe , then equation [ [ eq : fvexp ] ] simplifies to @xmath45 this assumption is justified if the duration of the phase transition is less than a hubble time interval , @xmath46 @xcite .    we can proceed to calculate the duration of the phase transition from @xmath34@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the  beginning \" of the phase transition @xmath47 will be defined as the time when @xmath48 of the universe is found to be in the true vacuum ; and similarly , the  end \" of the phase transition @xmath30 is given by the time when the universe is @xmath31 in the true vacuum .",
    "we will choose @xmath49 and @xmath50 such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , @xmath49 and @xmath50 satisfy @xmath53 thus , the duration of the phase transition , i.e. the time it takes for the universe to move from @xmath48 to @xmath31 true vacuum , is given by @xmath54 for the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 chosen above , @xmath55    it should be noted that this time duration is not a measurement of how long the universe stayed in the  false \" vacuum .",
    "the exponential nature of the nucleation rate allows the  false \" minimum to be stable for a long time , providing the necessary expansion that resolves the flatness problem ; and proceeds to rapidly destabilize the  false \" vacuum so that it can tunnel quickly and percolation is achieved .",
    "thus , the duration of the phase transition as defined by equation [ [ duration ] ] measures the pace at which vacuum changes from being @xmath48 to @xmath31 in the global minimum .",
    "in the model where the universe slowly rolls for a long time before changing direction in field space and rapidly tunneling , this is the time for the tunneling only .",
    "it will serve convenient to take advantage of the natural cosmological time parameter , the hubble time , to define @xmath56 one can roughly think of @xmath1 as the number of e - foldings during the tunneling transition , as evidenced by equation [ [ chidef ] ] and equation [ [ duration ] ] .",
    "therefore , the assumption of having a phase transition faster than a hubble time interval constrains the values of @xmath1 that can be consistently studied .",
    "we require that @xmath57 @xmath58 thus , the single - phase transition inflationary models studied here will be restrained to have @xmath59 with the choices leading to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : deltat ] ) , this constraint amounts to no more than 1 e - fold during the tunneling ( as expected since the origin of this constraint is that the simplified equations we are using only apply if we can neglect the expansion of the universe . )",
    "in addition any physically viable inflationary model needs to percolate .",
    "we will follow the arguments made by turner et al.(1992 ) in order to utilize their bound on the nucleation rate to further constrain the parameter @xmath1 @xcite . in order for the bubbles to  outrun \" the general cosmic expansion",
    ", a successful inflationary transition needs to decrease the actual physical volume in the false vacuum , @xmath60 .",
    "nucleated bubbles will be able to  outrun \" the inflationary expansion once @xmath61 the ability to decrease the physical volume found in the false vacuum does not guarantee percolation but is a necessary condition .",
    "we define  @xmath62 \" to be the time at which this criterion is satisfied , @xmath63 ( i.e. @xmath64 ) .",
    "turner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found a lower bound on a time - dependent nucleation rate @xmath65 which we apply here .",
    "we note that guth and weinberg ( 1983 ) had originally found a lower bound on a _ constant _ nucleation rate in order to achieve percolation , applicable to the case of old inflation ( which failed exactly because it does not percolate)@xcite .",
    "the work of turner et al ( 1992 ) , on the other hand , is for time - dependent nucleation rates as relevant here .",
    "we would like to convert the constraint in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : percolate ] ) to a bound on @xmath1 . utilizing equation ( [ i ] ) and taking @xmath66 , we find that @xmath67 thus the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : percolate ] ) implies the following upper bound on @xmath1 : @xmath68    it should be noted that this bound is less restrictive than the one in eqn.([eq : nohubble ] ) ; any model satisfying @xmath69 automatically satisfies the percolation bound .",
    "we require both constraints to hold , i.e. , the inflationary transition goes from @xmath70 true vacuum sufficiently fast to ignore the expansion of the universe and the physical volume of false vacuum decreases , allowing for the universe to percolate .",
    "the spectrum of gravity waves ( gws ) from multi - bubble collisions at a tunneling phase transition ( pt ) with energy difference @xmath0 between false and true vacua was worked out numerically in @xcite and subsequently more accurately by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be the only two free variables that characterize the spectrum of single pt models . in this paper",
    "we will follow the results of huber and konstandin ( 2008 ) @xcite .",
    "they computed the gw spectrum resulting from multi - bubble collisions produced by a time - dependent exponential nucleation rate .",
    "their simulations assumed a phase transition that lasted much less than @xmath46 and thus justified neglecting the expansion of the universe .",
    "the assumptions taken by huber et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are the same taken in the previous section , which enable us to take full advantage of their results . here",
    "we examine which region of the parameter space @xmath71 advanced ligo would be able to observe .",
    "the gravitational wave energy spectrum is defined to be @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the frequency , @xmath74 is the current critical density and @xmath75 is the gravitational wave energy density .",
    "the gw energy spectrum depends on the wall velocity of the bubbles ( @xmath76 ) , the fraction of vacuum energy to radiation energy ( @xmath77 ) , and the efficiency at which the vacuum energy is transformed into kinetic energy of the bulk fluid instead of reheating the plasma inside the bubble ( @xmath78 ) @xcite . for purposes of this paper",
    ", we will take the wall velocity to be close to the speed of light ( @xmath79 ) , assume the strong - detonation limit ( @xmath80 ) , and take @xmath81 so that the vacuum energy is converted almost to its entirety into the kinetic ( rather than thermal ) energy of the bubble .",
    "this further supports our assumption of taking the wall velocity to be close to the speed of light , since the constant pressure felt by the bubble wall will force it to accelerate to relativistic speeds very quickly @xcite .",
    "henceforth we will take the results found by huber and konstandin ( 2008 ) in @xcite and take the limits : @xmath82 , @xmath80 and @xmath83 .",
    "these are the limits necessary to study vacuum bubbles @xcite .",
    "the numerical results of huber and konstandin ( 2008 ) @xcite can roughly be fit in the following three frequency regimes as @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the gw energy spectrum evaluated at the peak frequency and will be defined in terms of physical parameters of the phase transition shortly . here",
    "@xmath86 is the current hubble parameter in units of @xmath87 km / sec / mpc . in order to work with an analytic expression for the spectrum",
    ", we construct the gw energy spectrum as a piece - wise function in the following manner    @xmath88    we determine the value of the constants @xmath89 and @xmath90 by demanding the spectrum to be sufficiently smooth , i.e. , we take the matching conditions @xmath91 in eq.(24 ) we accept an error of @xmath92 .",
    "then we find that the gw energy spectrum has the following approximate structure @xmath93 this enables us to estimate the numerical calculations for the gw energy spectrum found by huber and konstandin ( 2008 ) in an analytic fashion .",
    "the peak frequency of the gw spectrum is determined by the characteristic timescale of the phase transition , @xmath94 ( see eq.([eq : betadef ] ) ) . specifically , huber et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find for the peak frequency @xmath95 they also find @xmath96 for the peak amplitude , where we have taken @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath80 in the final equality .",

    "assuming that reheating is instantaneous allows us to evaluate @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is the temperature increase right after a single phase transition , @xmath103 and the total number of relativistic degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath102 is taken to be @xmath104 .",

    ", the reheating epoch could also last for some time .",
    "the details of the reheating epoch will depend on how the kinetic energy of the walls is converted into heat .",
    "reheating in the context of a first order phase transition has been considered in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown by r. watkins and l. widrow that bubble collisions convert the energy in the bubble walls efficiently into scalar radiation @xcite .",

    "we consider the effects of a non - instantaneous reheating epoch on the gravitational wave energy spectrum .",
    "with the exception of the appendix , we will assume for all future calculations that reheating was instantaneous .",

    "other proposed gw experiments , such as bbo and decigo , would be able to contribute further to the search for inflationary gw signals .",
    "these instruments could probe smaller frequencies with higher sensitivities and therefore study inflation models with smaller energy difference between vacua and faster phase transitions ( i.e. lower values of @xmath0 and @xmath1)@xcite .    in the future",
    "a theoretical study of gw produced in bubble collisions arising from slower phase transitions would be interesting , as these would also be testable by advanced ligo . unfortunately this case is much more difficult . in this paper we assumed that the phase transition lasted less than a hubble time interval , i.e. , we only considered values of @xmath69 . in principle",
    "the value could be as high as @xmath136 and still percolate .",

    "in this section we will consider the effects of having a non - instantaneous reheating epoch after the first order phase transition on the gravitational wave energy spectrum .",
    "we begin by rewriting eqn . [ [ f^0-omega0 ] and [ f^0-omega01 ] ] as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the scale factor at the end of the phase transition , @xmath142 is the scale factor at the end of reheating and @xmath143 is the scale factor today .",
    "distinct reheating models will give different values for @xmath144 , since the duration and equation of state of the universe depends on the details of the model .    during the reheating phase the homogeneous inflaton decays into lighter particles that will ultimately thermalize and acquire a black body spectrum at a temperature @xmath145 .",
    "once the universe reaches thermal equilibrium , then the hubble parameter at that time is given by @xmath146 , where @xmath147 gev is the planck mass , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is the total number of relativistic degrees of freedom at temperature @xmath145 . in future calculations we will approximate @xmath150 , although it could be a factor of 10 lower if we consider reheating to end at the beginning of big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the duration and expansion history of the reheating phase , before the universe reaches thermal equilibrium , is sensitive to the details and parameters of the reheating model .",
    "the reheating epoch has been studied in the context of first order phase transitions by @xcite.in particular , the universe could have differing values for the equation of state during the reheating phase : @xmath129 similar to a matter dominated universe or @xmath151 like in a radiation dominated universe , among others .",
    "thus , we write the hubble parameter at the time of thermal equilibrium as @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the equation of state of the universe during the reheating epoch .      combining eq[[reheating_fpeak ] and [ reheating_omegapeak ] ] with equations [ [ a * ] and [ hm ] ] , the dependence of @xmath155 and @xmath156 on @xmath157",
    ", @xmath158 becomes clear .",
    "the peak frequency and gw energy density per critical density today are given by @xmath159 @xmath160    note that the factor @xmath161 , which depends on the reheating parameters , equals to unity if @xmath151 .",
    "in other words , the peak frequency and gw energy density measured today are unaffected by the details of the reheating model if the universe had an equation of state similar to radiation domination right after the phase transition ended .",
    "in contrast , if the universe had an equation of state @xmath129 during the reheating epoch , then the peak frequency and gw energy density decrease by @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively . specifically , if we take the overly conservative bound that reheating lasted until the beginning of big bang nucleosynthesis and @xmath129 , then the gw energy density decrease by a factor of ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "this would make detection at adv .",
    "ligo impossible .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to emphasize that this is an extreme case .",
    "the work of r. watkins and l. widrow suggest that reheating after a first order phase transition could be very efficient ; comparable to slow - roll inflationary models ."
