    "<S> this phenomenon , termed error threshold , poses an interesting challenge to the theories of the origin of life , since it prevents the emergence of huge molecules which could carry the necessary information for building a complex metabolism ( eigen and schuster 1979 , kauffman 1993 ) .    in the quasispecies model , a molecule </S>",
    "<S> is represented by a string of @xmath0 digits @xmath1 , with the variables @xmath2 allowed to take on @xmath3 different values , each representing a different type of monomer used to build the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the focus is on the time evolution of the concentrations @xmath4 of molecules of type @xmath5 which obey the following differential equations ( eigen 1971 ) @xmath6 x_i \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the constants @xmath7 stand for the death probability of molecules of type @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a dilution flux that keeps the total concentration constant . </S>",
    "<S> the feature that distinguishes this model from the well - established models of population genetics ( hartl and clark 1989 ) is the replication matrix @xmath10 which takes into account the primary structure of the molecules . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , its elements are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the replication rate of molecules of type @xmath8 , @xmath14 is the hamming distance between molecules @xmath8 and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 $ ] is the single - monomer replication accuracy , which is assumed to be the same for all monomers .    for simple replication landscapes , the solutions of the @xmath17 kinetic equations ( [ ode ] ) </S>",
    "<S> have been thoroughly studied using perturbation theory ( eigen _ et al _ 1989 ) . </S>",
    "<S> more complex , spin - glass - like replication landscapes can be analysed using the correspondence between those equations and the equilibrium properties of a surface lattice system ( leuthuser 1986 , leuthuser 1987 , tarazona 1992 , franz _ et al _ 1993 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to mention that for the single - peaked replication landscape the exact stationary solution of equations ( [ ode ] ) can be obtained by mapping them into a polymer localization problem ( galluccio _ et al _ 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a population genetics approach to the quasispecies model has been proposed that , in spite of its simplicity , yields results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained by solving the kinetic equations ( alves and fontanari 1996 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative interpretation of the quasispecies model is given by considering the @xmath17 different strings @xmath18 as different forms ( alleles ) of a certain gene that determines the _ fitness _ @xmath13 of the haploid organisms . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this model is equivalent to the classical one - locus , multiple - allele model of population genetics ( hartl and clark 1989 ) , except for the mutation mechanism which must be adapted to satisfy the constraints imposed by the internal structure of the alleles . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , wiehe _ et al _ ( 1995 ) have generalized the original haploid formulation of the quasispecies model so as to consider the evolution of diploid organisms as well . </S>",
    "<S> an important by - product of that analysis is the study of the effects of dominance on error thresholds , which has led to an interesting conjecture about the evolution of dominance .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we employ the population genetics formulation of the quasispecies model to investigate the error propagation in the reproduction of diploid organisms . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows us to study in great detail the dynamical behavior of the model in the full space of the control parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 as well as in the space of the parameters that specify the fitness landscapes . </S>",
    "<S> we should mention that the analysis of wiehe _ et al _ ( 1995 ) was based on the numerical solution of the diploid counterpart of the kinetic equations ( [ ode ] ) and on very crude approximations that neglect the effects of back mutations .    in the population genetics formulation , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 different alleles are grouped into @xmath21 classes , according to the number of monomers of each type they have , regardless their specific position inside the allele . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a given class is characterized by the vector @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the number of monomers of type @xmath24 in any allele inside that class . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the alleles belonging to the same class are assumed to be equivalent , in the sense that their presence confers the same fitness value on the genotypes . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial simplifying assumption of the population genetics approach is that , given the monomer frequencies in generation @xmath26 , @xmath27 with @xmath28 , the frequencies of alleles in class @xmath29 are given by the multinomial distribution @xmath30^{p_1 } \\left [ p_2(t ) \\right ] ^{p_2 } \\ldots \\left [ p_\\kappa(t ) \\right ] ^{p_\\kappa}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at generation @xmath26 , the monomers are sampled with replacement from an urn containing @xmath3 different types of monomers in the proportions @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath33 denote the fitness of the genotypes @xmath34 , i.e. , genotypes composed of any pair of alleles belonging to classes @xmath35 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> then the fraction of monomers @xmath37 that the genotype @xmath34 contributes to generation @xmath38 is proportional to the product of three factors : ( a ) its frequency in the population @xmath39 , ( b ) its fitness @xmath40 , and ( c ) the average number of monomers @xmath37 that replicate correctly , @xmath41 , plus the average number of monomers @xmath42 that mutate to @xmath37 , @xmath43 \\sum_{\\beta \\neq \\alpha } ( p_\\beta^i + p_\\beta^j)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a simple calculation yields the following equations for the time evolution of the monomer frequencies : @xmath44 , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 and the normalization factor , @xmath46 is the average fitness of the entire population . here </S>",
    "<S> the notation @xmath47 stands for @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the kronecker delta . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that equation ( [ sex ] ) is identical to the equation governing the evolution of sexually reproducing haploid organisms ( alves and fontanari 1996 ) .    in the remainder of this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will consider binary strings only . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there are two types of monomers ( @xmath50 ) , so that the alleles are characterized by a single parameter , namely , the number of monomers of type 1 they have , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of our analysis to larger values of @xmath3 is straightforward . to proceed </S>",
    "<S> further we must specify the fitness of the genotypes @xmath52 . according to wiehe _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ ( 1995 ) we consider the following diploid analogue of the single - peaked fitness landscape : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the parameter measuring the selective advantage of the so - called _ master _ allele @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the dominance parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the master allele is completely dominant for @xmath57 and completely recessive for @xmath58 . for @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath60 and so there is no dominance . in this case equation ( [ sex ] ) reduces to the equation that governs the evolution of asexually reproducing haploid organisms ( alves and fontanari 1996 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the intervals @xmath61 and @xmath62 $ ] delimitate the regions of recessivity and dominance , respectively , of the master allele </S>",
    "<S> . there are other cases of interest as well : @xmath63 models the phenomenon of heterosis or hybrid vigor ( heterozygote advantage ) , while @xmath64 models the phenomenon that occurs at the early stages of speciation when hybrids are less viable ( heterozygote disadvantage ) .    inserting equation ( [ a ] ) into the recurrence equation ( [ sex ] ) </S>",
    "<S> yields the following equation for the frequency of monomers of type 1 in generation @xmath26 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68    in figure 1 we present the steady - state frequencies of alleles , obtained by solving the recursion equation ( [ p_single ] ) with @xmath69 , as a function of the error rate per monomer @xmath70 for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and different values of the dominance parameter . in the case of perfect replication accuracy ( @xmath73 ) , the fixed point @xmath74 is always unstable , while @xmath75 is stable for @xmath76 only . for @xmath63 , </S>",
    "<S> a third ( stable ) fixed point @xmath77 appears signalling the emergence of heterosis . for @xmath78 </S>",
    "<S> there are two distinct regimes : the _ quasispecies _ regime characterized by a population dominated by the master allele and its close neighbors , and the _ uniform _ regime where the @xmath79 alleles appear in the same proportion ( clearly the class @xmath80 is the most favored in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> the error rate at which the discontinuous transition between these two regimes takes place is termed _ error threshold _ @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath82 increases , the size of the jump at the transition decreases till it disappears at a critical value @xmath83 . beyond that value </S>",
    "<S> it is no longer possible to distinguish the two regimes .    to better characterize the error threshold transition we concentrate our analysis on the nature of the fixed points @xmath84 which are given by the real roots of @xmath85 , where @xmath86 for small error rates this equation has only one real root which corresponds to the stable fixed point @xmath87 associated to the quasispecies regime . as the error rate increases </S>",
    "<S> , a double root appears originating two new fixed points : a stable one , @xmath88 , associated to the uniform regime , and an unstable one that delimitates the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points . </S>",
    "<S> these fixed points co - exist till the error rate reaches the threshold value @xmath89 , where the stable quasispecies fixed point and the unstable one coalesce . for larger error rates , equation ( [ fix ] ) </S>",
    "<S> has only one real root which corresponds to the uniform fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the error threshold transition can be easily determined by solving @xmath90 simultaneously for @xmath91 and @xmath92 . as mentioned above , since these equations have two solutions we must choose the one with the larger value of @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical point @xmath93 is determined by tuning the value of @xmath94 so that the three real roots of ( [ fix ] ) coincide , i.e. , we have to solve the three equations @xmath95 simultaneously for @xmath91 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    using the prescriptions given above , we present in figure 2 the error threshold transition lines as a function of @xmath82 for @xmath71 and several values of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the error threshold @xmath81 is practically insensitive to variations of @xmath82 for negative and small positive values of this parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it reaches its minimal value around @xmath99 ( non - dominance regime ) and then increases quickly as the system enters the dominance region , @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> we note the reentrant behavior of these transition lines : for certain values of @xmath20 , the system undergoes two discontinuous transitions as @xmath82 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the transition lines end at critical points , which are shown in figure 3 for different values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that only for @xmath101 ( or more exactly @xmath102 ) the critical lines touch the axis @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> so , in these cases , there are values of the dominance parameter @xmath104 for which the error threshold transition never occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> heretofore we have concentrated on the location of the error threshold as a function of the dominance parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to the analysis of the composition of the population at the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> it can be characterized by the average normalized hamming distance from the master allele which , within the population genetics framework , is given simply by @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is shown in figure 4 as a function of the error rate for @xmath71 , @xmath106 and several values of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> what is remarkable about this figure is that there exists a value of the error rate @xmath107 such that the fixed point @xmath108 is independent of @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> this fixed point , however , becomes unstable for @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although recessivity leads to a higher concentration of the master allele for @xmath110 , this allele is quickly lost from the population for larger error rates . the main effect of dominance is to postpone the error catastrophe at the price of reducing the concentration of the master allele in the population . </S>",
    "<S> we note that at the inflection point @xmath111 the effects of dominance and recessivity are reversed . </S>",
    "<S> this point can be easily determined by setting to zero the coefficient of the term @xmath112 in equation ( [ fix ] ) , namely , @xmath113 and solving @xmath114 together with @xmath85 for @xmath91 and @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> both analyses , the location of the error threshold and the composition of the population , indicate that dominance allows the master allele to resist to higher replication error rates than in the case of non - dominance . actually , for sufficiently large @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> , it can even avoid the error catastrophe . </S>",
    "<S> this finding has been proposed as a possible explanation for the fact that the wild type , i.e. , the allele that predominates in a population and that is particularly well suited to its environment , is often dominant : the dominant alleles might be the prevailing wild - type ones simply because they can tolerate higher error rates ( wiehe _ et al _ 1995 ) .    in summary , we have employed the population genetics approach to the quasispecies model to investigate the error threshold catastrophe in the evolution of diploid organisms . in order to enhance the non - trivial effects of the imperfect replication accuracy of the organisms on the population composition , we have focused on a simple diploid analogue of the single - peaked fitness landscape . </S>",
    "<S> two distinct steady - state regimes are observed : the quasispecies regime where the information about the environment , modelled by the fitness landscape , is preserved in the population composition , and the uniform regime , where this information is irreversibly lost . in the space of the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath82 , these regimes are separated by discontinuous transitions lines that terminate at critical points , beyond which they become indistinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that dominance ( @xmath100 ) can postpone or even avoid the error catastrophe . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting , however , that a recessive allele ( @xmath117 ) can do better than a non - dominant one ( @xmath118 ) .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we mention that our results are in qualitative agreement with those of wiehe _ et al _ ( 1995 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the population genetics approach of the quasispecies model incorporates only a few essential features of the original chemical kinetics formulation , this agreement gives a strong evidence for the robustness of the main conclusion drawn from the model , namely , the existence of an error catastrophe that limits the size of self - replicating organisms . rather than just a caricature of the original model , the population genetics model presented in this paper may be viewed as a simpler , alternative model for investigating the evolution of self - replicating organisms , which may greatly facilitate the analysis of difficult problems such as the error propagation in finite populations and the effects of cooperation or catalysis among the evolving organisms . </S>"
