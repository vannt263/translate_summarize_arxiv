    "let us first present a brief description of a procedure detailed in @xcite for constructing rank-@xmath5 solutions in terms of riemann invariants for the case of an isentropic compressible ideal fluid in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "such a model is governed by the equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are @xmath10 real - valued matrix functions of the form @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the adiabatic exponent of the medium under consideration .",

    "we adopt the summation convention over repeated lower and upper indices .",
    "the purpose of this article is to obtain rank-@xmath5 solutions of system ( [ original - system ] ) expressible in terms of riemann invariants . to this end",
    ", we seek solutions @xmath23 of ( [ original - system ] ) defined implicitly by the following set of relations between the variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 for some function @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "such a solution is called a rank-@xmath5 solution if @xmath29 .",
    "the functions @xmath30 are called the riemann invariants associated with the wave vectors @xmath31 of the system ( [ original - system ] ) . here , @xmath32 denotes a direction of wave propagation and the eigenvalue @xmath33 is a phase velocity of the considered wave .",
    "two types of admissible wave vectors for the isentropic equations ( [ original - system ] ) are obtained by solving the dispersion relation @xmath34   ( \\lambda_0 + \\vec{u}\\cdot\\vec{\\lambda})^2                         = 0.\\ ] ] they are called the entropic @xmath35 and acoustic @xmath36 wave vectors and are defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are unit and arbitrary vectors , respectively .",
    "the construction of rank-@xmath5 solutions through the conditional symmetry method ( csm ) is achieved by considering an overdetermined system , consisting of the original system ( [ original - system ] ) in @xmath40 independent variables together with a set of compatible first order differential constraints ( dcs ) ,    @xmath41    for which a symmetry criterion is automatically satisfied .",
    "such notions as conditional symmetry , conditional symmetry algebra and conditionally invariant solution for the original system ( [ original - system ] ) we use in accordance with definitions given in @xcite . under the above circumstances ,",
    "the following result holds :    the isentropic compressible ideal fluid equations ( [ original - system ] ) admit a @xmath42-dimensional conditional symmetry algebra @xmath43 if and only if there exists a set of @xmath42 linearly independent vector fields @xmath44 which satisfy on some neighborhood of @xmath45 the trace conditions @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denotes the symmetrization over all indices in the bracket .",
    "solutions of the system which are invariant under the lie algebra @xmath43 are precisely rank-@xmath5 solutions of the form ( [ rank - k - solution ] ) .",
    "this result is a special case of the proposition in @xcite .",
    "note that these symmetries are not symmetries of the original system , but they can be used to construct solutions of the overdetermined system composed of ( [ original - system ] ) and ( [ differential - constraints ] ) .    for the case of rank-@xmath49 entropic solution @xmath50 , the wave vector @xmath51 is a non - zero multiple of ( [ wavevectors ] i ) .",

    "these particular solutions of ( [ trace - eq ] i ) and ( [ trace - eq ] ii ) can be obtained by assuming that the function @xmath71 is in the form of a rational function , which may also be interpreted as a truncated laurent series in the variables @xmath72 .",
    "this method can work only for equations having the painlev property @xcite .",
    "consequently , these equations can be very often integrated in terms of known functions .    applying a version of the conditional symmetry method to the isentropic model ( [ original - system ] ) ,",
    "several new classes of solutions have been constructed in a closed form @xcite . comparing these results with the ones obtained via the generalized method of caracteristics ( gmc ) @xcite ,",
    "it was shown that more diverse classes of solutions are involved in superpositions ( i.e. rank-@xmath5 solutions ) than in the case of the gmc @xcite .",
    "this paper is a continuation of the papers @xcite .",
    "the objective is to construct bounded elliptic solutions of the isentropic system ( [ original - system ] ) using the version of the csm proposed in @xcite .",
    "these types of solutions are obtained through a proper selection of differential constraints ( dcs ) compatible with the initial system of equations ( [ original - system ] ) .",
    "that is , the solution should satisfy both the initial system ( [ original - system ] ) and the differential constraints ( [ differential - constraints ] ) . among the new results obtained , we have rank-2 and rank-3 periodic bounded solutions expressed in terms of weierstrass @xmath0-functions .",
    "they represent bumps , kinks and multiple waves , all of which depend on riemann invariants .",
    "these solutions remain bounded even when the invariants admit a gradient catastrophe .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we construct rank-2 and rank-3 elliptic solutions of the system , among which multiple waves and doubly periodic solutions are included , and we show that they remain bounded everywhere .",
    "section 3 summarizes the results obtained and contains some suggestions for future developments .",
    "the construction approach outlined in section 1 has been applied to the isentropic flow equations ( [ original - system ] ) in order to obtain rank-2 and rank-3 solutions .",
    "the results of our analysis are summarized in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "several of them possess a certain amount of freedom .",
    "they depend on one or two arbitrary functions of one or two riemann invariants , depending on the case .",
    "the range of the types of solutions obtained depends on different combinations of the vector fields @xmath73 as given in ( [ vector - fields - prop ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "we denote by @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , etc , @xmath78 the solutions which are the result of nonlinear superpositions of rank-@xmath49 solutions associated with different types of wave vectors ( [ wavevectors ] i ) and ( [ wavevectors ] ii ) . by @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    "we denote the riemann invariants which coincide with the group invariants of the differential operators @xmath73 of the solution under consideration .",
    "the arbitrary functions appearing in the solutions listed in tables 1 and 2 allow us to change the geometrical properties of the governed fluid flow in such a way as to exclude the presence of singularities .",
    "this fact is of special significance since , as is well known @xcite , in most cases , even for arbitrary smooth and sufficiently small initial data at @xmath81 the magnitude of the first derivatives of riemann invariants becomes unbounded in some finite time @xmath82 .",
    "thus , solutions expressible in terms of riemann invariants usually admit a gradient catastrophe . nevertheless , we have been able to show that it is still possible in these cases to construct bounded solutions expressed in terms of elliptic functions , through the proper selection of the arbitrary functions appearing in the general solution . for this purpose",
    "it is useful to select dcs corresponding to a certain class of the nonlinear klein - gordon equation which is known to possess rich families of bounded solutions @xcite .",
    "we choose elliptic solutions of the klein - gordon equation because a group theoretical analysis has already been performed @xcite .",
    "the obtained results can be adapted to the isentropic ideal compressible fluid flow in ( @xmath4 ) dimensions .",
    "thus , we specify the arbitrary function(s ) appearing in the general solutions listed in tables 1 and 2 , say @xmath83 , to the differential constraint in the form of the klein - gordon @xmath84-field equation in three independent variables @xmath79 and @xmath80 which form the coordinates of the minkowski space @xmath85 @xmath86 here , we choose @xmath87 to be timelike and @xmath88 to be spacelike coordinates .",

    "<S> a modified version of the conditional symmetry method , together with the classical method , is used to obtain new classes of elliptic solutions of the isentropic ideal compressible fluid flow in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on those types of solutions which are expressed in terms of the weierstrass @xmath0-functions of riemann invariants . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions are of special interest since we show that they remain bounded even when these invariants admit the gradient catastrophe . </S>",
    "<S> we describe in detail a procedure for constructing such classes of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present several examples of an application of our approach which includes bumps , kinks and multi - wave solutions .    </S>",
