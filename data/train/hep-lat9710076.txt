    "block spin renormalization group @xcite has become an important tool in the qualitative and quantitative understanding of critical phenomena in classical statistical mechanics and euclidean quantum field theory . as a basic ingredient",
    ", it introduces effective hamiltonians ( actions in field theoretic language ) which govern block spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the block spins are determined from the original degrees of freedom by averaging them over blocks .    in principle",
    ", renormalization group ( rg ) solves the problems posed by critical or nearly critical statistical systems . under iterated application of the block transformation , either the correlation length in the system becomes small , or the flow of effective hamiltonians eventually reaches a fixed point which determines the universal properties of the system .",
    "a major drawback of the rg approach stems from the fact that effective hamiltonians in general contain an infinite number of couplings , in contrast to the original hamiltonians one starts from , which usually contain only a small number of interaction terms .",
    "the proliferation of couplings has a number of consequences .",
    "it is , e.g. , not always clear how a certain truncation to a finite number of couplings affects the physical results .",
    "furthermore , even if one relies on a certain truncation scheme , it might be tedious to explicitly compute the effective couplings .",
    "this might be an explanation why the task of explicit computation of block spin effective actions has not received very much attention in the literature .",
    "see , however , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "svetitsky and yaffe  @xcite have conjectured that a ( continuous ) deconfinement transition of a @xmath3dimensional finite temperature lattice gauge theory should be in the same universality class as the phase transition of a corresponding @xmath4dimensional spin system .",
    "this spin system should have the center of the gauge group as a global symmetry group .",
    "the svetitsky ",
    "yaffe conjecture for @xmath1 gauge theory at finite temperature offers the possibility of an interesting application of the block spin renormalization group .",
    "first , it has never been rigorously proved that this model belongs to the ising universality class . on the other hand",
    ", the conjecture has been checked several times by comparison of monte carlo ( mc ) estimates for the critical indices ( which were found in good agreement @xcite ) , as well as with a mean field like analytical approach ( which gives also predictions for @xmath5 deconfinement temperatures @xcite ) .",
    "however , so far there have been no numerical attempts to explicitly compute the effective action for the polyakov loops and compare it with that of the ising model .    with this article , we intend to fill this gap .",
    "we will demonstrate that actions for the degrees of freedom relevant for the deconfinement transition can well be computed by monte carlo . comparing them with the corresponding actions for the ising model we are able to confirm the validity of the svetitsky ",
    "yaffe conjecture in a very fundamental way .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  2 we introduce the notations for finite temperature lattice gauge theory and recall the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture . in section",
    "3 we introduce the block spin renormalization group .",
    "section  4 explains the idea of flow matching , and the application of improved monte carlo renormalization group ( imcrg ) @xcite to @xmath1 lattice gauge theory is described in some detail . in section  5 we discuss some details of our monte carlo methods and present the results .",
    "conclusions follow .",
    "let us briefly review the formulation of finite temperature gauge theory on a lattice ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    consider an @xmath5 gauge system on a @xmath3dimensional hypercubic lattice of size @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the spatial and temporal extensions , respectively , in units of the lattice spacing @xmath9 .",
    "a euclidean quantum field theory at finite temperature is obtained if one compactifies the ( imaginary ) temporal direction , keeping infinite the spatial directions . in a finite lattice formulation one",
    "therefore assumes @xmath10 .",
    "the compactification length is proportional to the inverse physical temperature @xmath11 n_ta =   .",
    "denote with @xmath12 the @xmath5 group element belonging to the link with origin in the site @xmath13 and pointing in the @xmath14direction .",
    "the usual wilson action reads s_g(u ) & = & _ p ( n - re  tr u_p ) , + & = &  a^d-1 , where @xmath15 is the product of the group elements around the plaquette @xmath16 .",
    "the partition function is given by z = _ n , d u_(n ) . because of the periodicity in the temporal direction , the system is also invariant under a global @xmath17 symmetry , i.e.  the center of the gauge group : its spontaneous symmetry breaking at a finite temperature @xmath18 is the signal of the deconfinement transition .",
    "the polyakov loop is an order parameter for the finite temperature deconfinement transition .",
    "it is the trace of the ordered product of all timelike links with the same space coordinate , wrapping in the time direction ( * x*)=_t=1^n_tu_0(*x*,t )  .",
    "it is a non  trivial observable from a topological point of view : its vacuum expectation value is not invariant under @xmath17 transformations .",
    "it is zero in the confining phase , while it acquires a finite value in the deconfined phase .",
    "according to the 15 years old svetitsky ",
    "yaffe conjecture  @xcite , integrating out the space  like degrees of freedom one should obtain an effective action for the polyakov loops which is short ranged and has the center of @xmath5 as a global symmetry group .",
    "thus , given a @xmath4dimensional classical spin system with the same symmetry properties , undergoing a continuous phase transition , the @xmath3dimensional quantum gauge model is expected to be in its universality class if the deconfinement transition is a continuous one and the effective hamiltonian has good locality properties .",
    "this applies in particular to the 4dimensional @xmath1 gauge model which should belong to the @xmath2 ising universality class .",
    "to define the block spin transformation , consider a magnetic system consisting of spins @xmath19 on the sites of a @xmath4dimensional lattice , defined by a hamiltonian @xmath20 and a set of couplings @xmath21 , h ( ) = - _ k_s _ ( )  .",
    "the partition function reads z = _ \\ { }  . the `` operators '' @xmath22 are in general all possible products of spins compatible with the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "explicit examples will be given below .",
    "a block spin transformation maps the fine @xmath23 lattice onto the block lattice of size @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "this is achieved by averaging the original spins over cubical blocks of side length @xmath26 according to a certain rule .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath27 of the block spins @xmath28 assigned to the sites of the block lattice is defined by = _ \\ { } p ( , ) , [ effec ] where @xmath16 encodes the mapping from the fine to the coarse lattice .",
    "it obeys p ( , ) 0 _ \\ { } p ( , ) = 1  .",
    "the latter property ensures that the partition function remains unchanged , z = _ \\ { } . [ zblock ] in this work we use the majority rule prescription ( i.e. the @xmath14 spins take values plus or minus one ) [ pdef ] p ( , ) = _ * x*^(blocks )  .",
    "[ majo ] the sign function sign@xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ pdef ] ) is defined such that it vanishes for @xmath30 .",
    "this ensures that in case of a zero sum of spins inside a block a positive ( negative ) @xmath31 is selected with probability one half .",
    "the block hamiltonian @xmath27 can be expressed in terms of operators @xmath32 , defined on the block lattice , h ( ) = - _ k_s_ ( ) .",
    "[ newh ]    in the case of the 4dimensional @xmath1 gauge model , the @xmath2 effective action for the signs of the polyakov loops shares ( by definition ) the @xmath33 symmetry with the @xmath2 ising model . to define this action we assign to each polyakov loop its sign _ * x*(u)=sign  l(*x * ) .",
    "[ mapping ] then we block the @xmath19spins with the majority rule to obtain ising type block @xmath14spins .",
    "it follows that , similarly to eq .",
    "( [ effec ] ) , the effective hamiltonian @xmath34 for the finite temperature gauge system is given by = du  p(,u )   , [ blockg ] with p(,u ) = _ * x*^(blocks )  .",
    "[ majog ] other procedures of blocking , like first averaging the polyakov loops inside the blocks and then take as ising type spin its sign , could also be employed .",
    "we close this section by defining a renormalization group flow . a natural way to do it would be to fix a block length , e.g. , @xmath35 , and then iterate the transformation ( [ majog ] ) .",
    "we do _ not _ stick to this definition here .",
    "instead we define the flow by just increasing the block size @xmath26 .",
    "this allows us to compute hamiltonians not only for scales @xmath36 , but also for arbitrary scales @xmath26 , with @xmath26 integer .",
    "in this section we first recall the rg matching idea .",
    "then we show how to apply the improved monte carlo renormalization group ( imcrg ) method by gupta and cordery  @xcite to @xmath0 @xmath1 gauge theory at finite temperature .      in the infinite  dimensional space of couplings @xmath21 , a renormalization group transformation @xmath37 can be looked at as a mapping of the original bare hamiltonian @xmath20 onto a new hamiltonian @xmath38 , defined by the couplings @xmath39 .",
    "the rg flow obtained under iterated rg transformations will eventually end in a fixed point @xmath40 , defined through @xmath41 .",
    "the critical surface is identified by all flows connected to the fixed point in this way .",
    "the rg matching method is based on the assumption that different physical systems , belonging to the same universality class , will follow rg flows which originate from different `` bare couplings '' on the critical surface and eventually match in a neighbourhood of the common fixed point . of course",
    ", a matching close to a non  trivial fixed point will only take place if both models under consideration are at criticality .",
    "a matching thus confirms both universality and allows to check for criticality .",
    "this matching method has been successfully applied in the context of spin models , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of matching different critical flows by means of mc methods mainly relies on the assumption that the different trajectories come close to each other , i.e.  approximately match , before the fixed point is actually reached , c.f .   figure  [ matchi ] . as we shall see , this condition is met for our models .",
    "the improved monte carlo renormalization group method  @xcite allows to compute effective actions for ising type block spins .",
    "the main idea is to avoid simulations of the original partition function . instead ,",
    "consider a _ modified _",
    "system defined through z_c & = & _ \\ { }    + & = & _ \\ { } _ \\ { }   p ( , )   , [ compensated ] where |h()= - _ |k_s_ ( ) [ guessh ] is a _ guess _ for @xmath42 .",
    "this system can be simulated once @xmath20 and @xmath43 are given .",
    "note the _ plus _ sign in front of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ compensated ] ) .",
    "the system with partition function @xmath44 is _ non  critical _ , even in the case of a critical hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "consider the expectation values _",
    "c  & = &   _ \\ { } s_   e^   + & = &   _ \\{}_\\ { } s_  p ( , )  e^  . if the guess is exact , i.e. , |h ( ) = h ( ) , [ exguess ] the block spins @xmath31 completely decouple and fluctuate independently . in other words , the system is non  critical and the correlations in @xmath44 are bounded by the block size @xmath26 .",
    "the correlations functions are then known exactly , _ o & = & 0 , + < s_ s_>_o & = & n _  _ , where @xmath46 are trivial multiplicity factors .",
    "let us assume that @xmath47 is close to @xmath42 .",
    "then a first order expansion gives _",
    "c = n _   ( k_-|k _ )   +   o ( ( k_-|k_)^2 ) .",
    "solving this equation for @xmath48 allows to improve the guess @xmath49 .",
    "usually a few iterations |k_|k_+ n_^-1<s_>_c , [ recursion ] where the expectation values are determined by simulation of the system  ( [ compensated ] ) , are sufficient to determine @xmath27 to a good precision .    to apply the imcrg procedure to the @xmath1 gauge system , one has to simulate the partition function z_c & = &   _ \\ { }   + & = &   _ \\ { } du   p(,u )",
    ". [ compensatedg ] remember that the @xmath14variables are defined as the majority rule block spins of the signs of the polyakov loops .",
    "it is straightforward to design a mc procedure for the updating of this system .",
    "details will be given in the next section .",
    "we applied the imcrg method to three different systems : the @xmath2 standard ising model ( with nearest  neighbour coupling ) , the @xmath2 `` @xmath50 '' model , which includes also a third , cube  diagonal neighbour coupling  @xcite , and the @xmath0 @xmath1 pure gauge model .",
    "we simulated the system defined by eq .",
    "( [ compensated ] ) for the spin models and by eq .",
    "( [ compensatedg ] ) for the @xmath1 gauge model .    for the updating of the ising model we used a metropolis algorithm :",
    "a single spin @xmath51 is proposed to be flipped .",
    "it is checked whether this update leads to a flip of the block spin @xmath31 , with @xmath52 .",
    "the total change of energy @xmath53 is then computed and used in the usual metropolis acceptance / rejectance step .    in case of the @xmath1 model , only the temporal links couple to the compensating block hamiltonian .",
    "the space  like links are updated using the incomplete kennedy  pendleton heat bath sweep @xcite supplied with a number of overrelaxation sweeps . for temporal links one employs again a metropolis procedure : a proposed change of a link matrix leads to a change of the polyakov loop @xmath54 of which it is member . if the sign @xmath51 changes , the block spin @xmath31 in turn might flip and give rise to a change of @xmath47 .",
    "the relevant energy change for the metropolis step is @xmath55 .    in practical calculations",
    "one has to truncate the interactions in @xmath27 and @xmath43 .",
    "we chose to include in the ansatz eight 2point couplings and six 4point couplings .",
    "the 2point couplings can be labelled by specifying the relative position of the interacting spins ( up to obvious symmetries ) : our couplings @xmath56 then correspond to 001 , 011 , 111 , 002 , 012 , 112 , 022 , 122 .",
    "the 4point couplings @xmath57 are defined in an obvious way through figure  [ quart ] .",
    "the corresponding interaction terms in the effective hamiltonian are denoted by @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "a merit of the imcrg method is that block spin observables are ( nearly ) decorrelated and the critical slowing down problem is less severe than in standard simulations .    in figure  [ csdfig ] we show scatterplots ( mc time history ) of measurements of the nearest neighbour block spin 2point function . the comparison is between a simulation of the pure gauge system ( without imcrg compensation on the block level ) and the system defined through eq .",
    "( [ compensatedg ] ) .",
    "the plot clearly shows that the imcrg type simulation suffers much less from critical slowing down .",
    "analogous observations were made in case of the ising model simulations with the compensating block hamiltonian switched on .",
    "it is the reduction of critical slowing down obtained from the compensation even on moderate lattice sizes which enabled us to obtain reasonable results with moderate cpu expense .",
    "we started by comparing the rg flow of the two ising models . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we summarize some parameters of the mc simulations .",
    "we made simulations on lattices consisting of @xmath60 blocks of size @xmath26 at the infinite volume critical couplings @xmath61  @xcite for the ordinary ising and @xmath62  @xcite for the @xmath50 model .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     finally , let us notice that within our statistic the @xmath63 flow can also be made compatible with the ising trajectory : a better resolution to discriminate between the two beta values would have required to extend the mc analysis to bigger block sizes @xmath26 , of course with much more cpu time consuming .",
    "even though , using the block sizes at our disposal the corresponding fit is not as good as that of the @xmath64 value .    therefore we assume the latter as the critical coupling value for @xmath65 , consistently ( within one standard deviation ) with ref .  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of mc results shows that the svetitsky  yaffe conjecture is confirmed in a very fundamental way by observing matching of the @xmath1 rg trajectory with that of the ising model .    at the same time",
    ", we showed that imcrg works well as a method to compute the effective action of ising type degrees of freedom in a genuine non  ising model like @xmath0 finite temperature @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "notice also that this kind of calculations could be done on workstations , with relatively small computer resources .",
    "an extension to @xmath8 greater than two would be interesting but more expensive .",
    "the reason is that with increasing temporal size the small @xmath26 actions move farther away from the fixed points , i.e.  they need to be blocked more in order to come close to the reference ising flows .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the fact that also in more standard approaches , e.g.  via the binder cumulant , the spatial size of the lattice has to be increased very much with increasing @xmath8 .    finally , it would be of interest to check this approach with different blocking prescriptions .",
    "the rate of approaching the rg fixed point is in fact very sensitive to the blocking rule used and a faster convergence can in principle be obtained using a more sophisticated blocking scheme than the majority rule .",
    "we would like to thank m.  caselle for interesting exchange of opinions .",
    "access to cpu resources of the torino i.n.f.n . is gratefully acknowledged ."
