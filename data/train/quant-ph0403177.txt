    "time - dependent quantum mechanics problems are usually addressed using time - dependent perturbation theory , adiabatic or sudden approximations as well as several numerical techniques .",
    "it is highly desirable , however , to obtain exact analytical solutions to given problems , especially in cases when the approximate methods may be inadequate to describe detailed aspects of the solutions or when numerical treatment does not explicitly reveal their mathematical properties at very large times .",
    "recently , there has been increasing interest in obtaining exact analytical solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation since they can be used to study certain physical systems such as quantum dots , bose - einstein condensates , unstable composite particles and many others .",
    "burrows and cohen @xcite have developed exact solutions for a double - well quasi - harmonic potential model with a time - dependent dipole field .",
    "cavalcanti , giacconi and soldati @xcite have solved the problem of decay from a point - like potential well in the presence of a uniform field and have indicated that , due to an infinitely large number of resonances , there may be deviations from the naively expected exponential time - dependence of the survival probability .",
    "the equivalence of exponential decay of a given energy eigenstate with fermi s golden rule when the final density of states is energy - independent and with the breit - wigner resonance curve has been long known in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "dullemond @xcite has verified this fact in a simple but exactly solvable model and found that if final - state energy - dependence is introduced into this model a non - exponential decay pattern will dominate at large times .",
    "et al . , _ @xcite have studied a variety of systems in which the initial wave function is mostly or entirely set in a finite potential well and have observed rich behaviour , including non - exponential decay into the continuum .",
    "non - exponentiality for monotonically decreasing survival probabilities at large times , though , can be strictly proven only if exact analytical solutions are obtained .",
    "specific systems that may exhibit non - exponential decay include systems with non - local interactions @xcite , certain closed many - body systems @xcite , quasi - particles in quantum dots @xcite , polarons @xcite , and non - extensive systems @xcite .    in this article",

    "a generalization of the asymptotic time behaviour to all square - integrable wavefunctions is obtained .",
    "the method consists of the following steps : ( a ) the time - independent solutions to schrdinger equation are found subject to the boundary conditions of the problem .",
    "these are stationary solutions , that is energy eigenfunctions , that span the hilbert space of the given hamiltonian .",
    "( b ) since any finite or infinite , discrete or continuous linear combination of the stationary solutions ( base functions ) is also a solution belonging to the given hilbert space , as long as it is square - integrable , exact analytical solutions can be developed by a convolution of the eigenfunctions with energy - dependent spectral functions multiplied by the standard oscillatory time - dependence of the stationary states .",
