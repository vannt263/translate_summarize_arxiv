    "how effectively can new particles hide the higgs boson from experiment ? with the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) having reached exclusion of the standard model higgs boson throughout a significant range of its mass @xcite , this question has taken on heightened importance . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that gluon fusion @xcite  the dominant production of higgs boson at the lhc  can be substantially reduced by one or more colored scalars with weak - scale mass and order - one couplings to the higgs doublet .    within the standard model , the overwhelmingly dominant contribution to higgs production through gluon fusion comes from a top quark loop @xcite . beyond the standard model , there can be 1-loop contributions from particles that carry color and that also interact with the higgs doublet .",
    "fermions with renormalizable couplings to the higgs doublet have contributions to the gluon fusion amplitude of the same sign as the top loop ( e.g. , a fourth generation @xcite ) .",
    "large suppressions to gluon fusion thus appear to require some colored bosons .",
    "in this paper we consider the possible suppression of higgs production through gluon fusion in the presence of colored scalar fields .",
    "one or more scalars @xmath0 transforming under qcd can be coupled to the higgs doublet through the renormalizable `` higgs portal '' interactions @xmath1 in the lagrangian .",
    "we point out that the sign of the parameter @xmath2 is not theoretically determined , so that for one choice , _ negative _ @xmath2 , the scalar contribution interferes destructively with the top loop .",
    "examples of models with colored scalars where effects on higgs production was discussed includes , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the reduction of gluon fusion has been noted previously in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where squark loops may partially cancel the top loop for certain regions of parameter space @xcite . in that case , the higgs boson is already required to be rather light in the mssm , in the mass region that is not yet ruled out by lhc and tevatron data .",
    "futhermore , supersymmetry requires the assortment of colored superpartners that is being pushed to higher masses by the nonobservation results from the searches for supersymmetry at the lhc .",
    "by contrast , we are interested in a more general scenario here , where the suppression of gluon fusion occurs for a wide range of higgs masses , and the particle responsible for the suppression is harder to detect .",
    "the concrete example we study here is the standard model extended by an electroweak - singlet , color - octet real scalar  @xcite .    besides explicit , renormalizable models that include particles running in loops that suppress gluon fusion",
    ", one can imagine a strongly - coupled sector @xcite that generates the dimension-6 operator @xmath3 in the lagrangian with the appropriate sign to cancel the top loop .",
    "in ref .  @xcite it was shown that a coefficient of @xmath4 for this operator leads to complete destructive interference with the standard model contribution for @xmath5  tev .",
    "if this operator is generated by a 1-loop diagram involving a particle of mass @xmath6 and coupling of order one to the higgs doublet , then a naive loop factor of @xmath7 leads to a value @xmath8 .",
    "as we will see , the loop suppression is accidentally stronger , so that @xmath6 needs to be somewhat smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "a detailed analysis is required to determine whether such light colored scalars are permitted by existing bounds from collider experiments .",
    "we emphasize that this class of models leaves electroweak symmetry breaking unaffected . as a result ,",
    "the branching fractions of the higgs boson remain virtually unaffected throughout the higgs mass range , especially when the colored scalars are electroweak - singlet . only the decay width into gluon pairs",
    "is reduced when higgs production through gluon fusion is suppressed , but this decay is very hard to observe and its branching fraction is already smaller than about 9% for any higgs mass allowed by lep .",
    "this is in contrast to models that modify the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , which , not surprisingly , affect both higgs production and decay , especially in the light higgs region @xcite .",
    "the general class of models leading to modifications in higgs production that we consider consist of the standard model extended to include a set of real or complex scalars @xmath10 transforming under some representations of the color @xmath11 group .",
    "the renormalizable interactions of the colored scalars are of the form @xmath12 where suitable color contractions are implicit ( for @xmath13 , this can result in several independent interactions ) .",
    "this set of interactions can be recast for real scalar fields under the replacement @xmath14 .",

    "we will analyze the color - octets in section iii . in the case of color - triplet complex scalars , the casimir is smaller , @xmath50 , so that several triplets are necessary to obtain substantial suppression with order - one @xmath51 couplings .",
    "supersymmetric models automatically have color - triplet scalars with substantial couplings to the higgs sector .",
    "the possibility of destructive interference between the top loop and loops of stops has been explored previously @xcite . in the supersymmetric case ,",
    "the coupling to the higgs is determined by supersymmetric as well as supersymmetry - breaking interactions , and so the size and sign of the contribution is model - dependent . in the limit of no supersymmetry breaking with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,",
    "there are two mass eigenstates , a pure @xmath54 and @xmath55 with masses equal to the top mass and higgs portal coupling given by @xmath56 . in the limit @xmath57 , the addition of the stops results in an increase in the amplitude by a factor of 3/2 , and thus an increase in the higgs production rate by a factor of 9/4 .",
    "this is indicative of the size of the correction that colored scalars can provide , but this particular limit does not yield a realistic model of low - energy supersymmetry due to the lack of both tree - level _ and _ one - loop corrections to the higgs mass itself .",

    "two on - shell decays could occur : @xmath59 and/or @xmath60 .",
    "this leaves four distinct possibilities : + @xmath61 @xmath62 : no imaginary part is generated for the amplitudes ; suppression of gluon fusion arises entirely through cancellation of the real parts of the diagrams .",

    "it increases rapidly ( in magnitude ) , such that @xmath65 = \\mathrm{re}[a_i(\\tau_i)]$ ] is achieved already once @xmath66 .",

    "interestingly , for @xmath74 and with @xmath75 , both the real and imaginary contributions to @xmath27 and @xmath28 are negative .",
    "this suggests there is an interesting regime where both the real and imaginary parts of the contributions from top loops and colored scalar loops can _ simultaneously _ destructively interfere .",
    "+ we will see all four of these cases arise in the specific model involving a color - octet scalar considered in the next section .",
    "it is also interesting to estimate how small the @xmath76 rate could be made in principle .",
    "note that so far we have neglected other quark contributions to the amplitude . while it is possible for scalar loop contributions to cancel the sum of the real parts of the top loop and the much smaller light quark contributions , without extraordinary tuning it is not possible to also cancel the small _",
    "imaginary _ part that accompanies @xmath77 . even for the smallest higgs mass allowed by lepii , we find the absolute value of the imaginary part of the @xmath78-quark loop contribution is smaller than 10% of the absolute value ( real part ) of the top quark contribution to the amplitude .",

    "we should note that our calculations of the cross sections have been performed in the narrow higgs width approximation , and for the largest higgs masses , the finite width effects become increasingly important .",

    "this yields the tree - level constraint @xcite @xmath135 which would appear to somewhat constrict the parameter space of our color - octet model .",
    "however , to properly bound @xmath2 , we must consider the effects of renormalization group ( rg ) running on the couplings in the potential .",
    "evolving to higher energies , the quartic coupling @xmath94 increases .",
    "this increase happens fairly quickly , driven primarily by the @xmath136 term in the beta function , and is enhanced by color combinatorial factors .",
    "equally important , the higgs portal coupling _ decreases _ in magnitude as we go to higher energy ; @xmath137 , so an initially large negative @xmath2 rapidly evolves to a small negative @xmath2 .",

    "we are not aware of a robust constraint that rules out the region @xmath139  gev , suggesting a more detailed analysis of the viability ( or lack thereof ) of this region would be interesting for experiments to carry out .",
    "it is interesting to correlate the suppression in single higgs production with changes in di - higgs production .",
    "the set of diagrams contributing to di - higgs production consist of both order @xmath2 ( e.g. triangle diagrams ) as well as @xmath140 ( e.g. box diagrams ) contributions to the amplitude . when single higgs production is suppressed , the order @xmath2 diagrams are suppressed .",
    "however , larger @xmath141 implies the second class of diagrams proportional to @xmath140 remain , and are dramatically enhanced . for the color - octet scalar model , we find the increased di - higgs production rate between a factor of a few to over @xmath126 times the sm rate for the same higgs mass @xcite .",
    "an increase in di - higgs production can also be found in the presence of cutoff scale operators @xcite .",
    "we must emphasize that our analysis of higgs suppression from a single color - octet scalar is merely one model of a large class of colored scalar models .",
    "the signals of any given model can be completely different .",
    "for example , supersymmetric models with light top squarks can easily have an order one negative @xmath2 , and yet the canonical search strategy for stops involves missing energy ( when @xmath142-parity is conserved ) with detailed considerations of stop decay . a model in which the colored scalars are `` quirks '' bound by a new strongly - coupled sector would yield completely different signals ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , while the searches for specific colored scalars are very important , what is more important for higgs physics is to study the extent to which the higgs boson can be observed in other channels .",
    "other higgs production sources continue to provide a smaller but non - negligible source for single higgs signals . specifically , associated production ( @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) and vector - boson - fusion ( vbf ) production sources remain unchanged .",
    "the vbf process provides a non - negligible single higgs production rate throughout the higgs mass range , though the rate is roughly a factor of 10 smaller than gluon fusion rate for @xmath145 .",
    "however , existing lhc search strategies have been optimized for a gluon - fusion source , and so as far as we understand , the present higgs production rate bounds can not be trivially rescaled .",
    "for example , current search strategies involving the @xmath146 final state allow @xmath147 additional jets in the signal @xcite .",
    "the vbf process generically produces two ( forward ) jets .",
    "hence , we suspect that the current higgs searches are sensitive to only a small fraction of the vbf rate",
    ". a more complete study of how effective the lhc experiments are sensitive to vbf production would be really useful .",
    "in addition , some strategies to constrain the light higgs mass region also depend on a convolution of the gluon fusion rate with other higgs production sources .",
    "for example , the inclusive selection at cms @xcite for the @xmath148 mode receives a substantial contribution from gluon fusion as well as vbf . obtaining bounds on the higgs production cross section in the presence of light colored scalars therefore requires separating out the various sources of higgs production .    finally , one new single higgs production channel is possible : associated production with a pair of scalars @xmath149 .",

    "<S> we show that production of the higgs boson through gluon - fusion may be suppressed in the presence of colored scalars . </S>",
    "<S> substantial destructive interference between the top quark diagrams and colored scalar diagrams is possible due to cancellations between the real ( and also imaginary ) parts of the amplitudes . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a color - octet scalar that has a negative , order one coupling to the higgs doublet . </S>",
    "<S> we find that gluon fusion can be suppressed by more than an order of magnitude when the scalar mass is below a few hundred gev , while milder suppressions occur for larger scalar masses or smaller couplings . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the standard model extended with only one particle can evade the full range of present lhc exclusion limits on the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> the colored scalars , however , would be produced in pairs with a large rate at the lhc , leading to multi - jet final states to which the lhc experiments are now becoming sensitive . </S>"
