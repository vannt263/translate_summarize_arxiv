    "nuclear radio emission is almost invariably associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and this is an indication that the process of accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) naturally produces a signature in the form of radiation in the radio domain .",
    "the separation between radio - loud ( rl ) and radio - quiet ( rq ) agns is in fact only a measure of the relative flux in the radio band with respect to the optical or x - ray nucleus @xcite ; but also rq agns , when studied at sufficient depth , usually show the presence at least of a nuclear radio component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for rl agns the radio core results from synchrotron emission produced by the unresolved base of their jets ; for rq agns",
    "the situation is more controversial and it has been recently proposed , besides the possibility of a jet origin , that their radio nuclei are the manifestation of the presence of a thermal outflow or of an active disk corona @xcite    when combined to the very limited effects that absorption has on radio waves , the study of radio emission provides , in principle , a very powerful tool to detect accretion onto smbh and , consequently , to establish when a smbh is present in a given galaxy . however , to take full advantage of this approach , we must reach a much deeper understanding of what determines the radio luminosity of a given galaxy and how this is related to its level of accretion .",
    "a large effort has been dedicated to explore the connection between the host properties ( mostly from an optical point of view ) and its radio emission . already from the pioneering study by @xcite it was clear that more massive galaxies have on average a higher radio luminosity than smaller galaxies , while apparently there are no distinctions between clusters and non - clusters members @xcite .",
    "the radio luminosity functions ( rlfs ) of galaxies of different optical magnitudes are similar but they differ strongly in their scaling .",
    "more recent studies confirm the early results , indicating that the normalization of the rlf scales with the host luminosity as @xmath1l@xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , galaxies of given optical magnitude show a very large range of radio power , more than 5 orders of magnitude , and the relation between the radio and optical luminosity can only be described in terms of a probability distribution .    these studies focused mostly on massive galaxies and had a relatively high threshold for the radio detection .",
    "the analysis reaching the lowest level of luminosity ( in both bands ) were performed by @xcite and @xcite , with limits at l@xmath6 and m@xmath7 -18.5 .",
    "consequently , the information on the radio properties of galaxies of lower mass is sparse and incomplete .",
    "similarly , there is still a dominant fraction of massive galaxies ( @xmath8 % ) undetected in radio surveys , for which only an upper limit to their radio luminosity can be derived .    clearly , a survey reaching lower radio and optical luminosities can provide new insights on the origin and properties of the radio emission of early - type galaxies .",
    "the virgo cluster represents a unique laboratory for such studies .",
    "in fact , it includes hundreds of early - type galaxies , spanning a wide range of stellar masses , for which a vast suite of data is available in the literature . in particular , the recent _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) survey performed by @xcite provides us with a detailed analysis of their optical brightness profiles whose properties , including the presence of a stellar nucleus , can be included in the study of their radio emission . given its proximity ,",
    "its members can be observed at high spatial resolution ( 1@xmath9 at a distance of 17 mpc corresponds to @xmath1 80 pc ) and their nuclear emission can be studied down to extremely low luminosity level . for this reason we performed a radio survey of 63 early - type galaxies in virgo with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "since the aim of these observations is to explore their nuclear properties , the data were taken at high resolution ( with the telescope in the a array configuration ) and at relatively high frequency ( 8.4 ghz ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sample ]",
    "we describe the sample and the vla observations ; in section [ results ] we discuss the link between the radio properties of the galaxies considered with their stellar mass , with their optical brightness profile and with the presence of a stellar nucleus ; we then perform an analysis of the multiwavelength properties of their nuclear emission , taking advantage of x - ray data taken from the literature .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section [ summary ] .",
    "we considered initially the same sample selected by @xcite for their _ hst _ survey of early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster . more specifically , they selected early - type galaxies from the vcc catalog @xcite that consists of 2096 galaxies within this @xmath10 140 deg@xmath11 region .",
    "a total of 1277 vcc galaxies were considered by @xcite to be members of virgo and for 403 cluster members radial velocities are available . a faint - end cutoff at b@xmath12 yields 352 galaxies , 163 of which are early - type galaxies according to the vcc morphological classifications of @xcite .",
    "a subset of 100 early - type galaxies was then selected for observations with advanced camera for survey ( acs ) on _ hst _ , excluding objects with uncertain morphologies , lacking a clearly visible bulge component , with the presence of strong dust lanes , or signs of strong tidal interactions .    of the 100 galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey , high - quality radio data already exist for seven sources , all of them within the top third in terms of optical luminosity .",
    "we observed with the vla additional 56 galaxies , in order of decreasing b@xmath13 band magnitude , for a total of 63 objects reaching b@xmath14 .",
    "the galaxies were observed at 8.4 ghz with the vla in the a - array configuration on 2006 april 17 .",
    "the source scans , which were each @xmath130  minutes long , were interspersed with @xmath12  minutes scans of the nearby phase calibrator , 1239 + 075 .",
    "3c286 was used as the flux density calibrator for the experiment .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard calibration and reduction procedures in the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . after the amplitude and phase calibration using the calibrators , the sources were split from the main data set and imaged using the task imagr .",
    "the detected radio sources were weak and were therefore not self - calibrated .",
    "the resolution of the radio images is typically around @xmath15 , corresponding to a linear size of @xmath1 20 pc at the distance of virgo .",
    "the typical resulting rms in the radio images is 30 @xmath16jy beam@xmath17 .",
    "five objects were detected with a peak to rms ratio larger than 5 , and radio fluxes of these galaxies are reported in table [ tabsample1 ] , together with the radio core measurements of the 7 radio galaxies found in the literature .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,>,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath18 the identification of the brightest x - ray source with the agn is uncertain @xcite .    the acs/_hst _ virgo survey images were used by @xcite to explore the properties of the surface brightness profiles ( sbp ) of the vcc galaxies .",
    "they found that , while the sbp are in general well described by a @xcite model , in most of the brightest galaxies the inner profiles are lower than expected based on an extrapolation of the outer srsic law .",
    "these galaxies are better described by a core - srsic profile as defined by @xcite .",
    "table [ tabsample1 ] reports the complete list of optical classifications .",
    "@xcite presented preliminary results of a program of _ chandra _ observations of the vcc sample .",
    "they report the analysis of x - ray images for 32 objects , 25 in common with our sub - sample , and found x - ray nuclei in 16 galaxies , whose luminosities are given in table [ lx ] .",
    "they conclude that these nuclear sources are most likely the manifestation of the presence of a low luminosity active nucleus .",
    "this opens the possibility of exploring the link between host brightness profile and agns multiwavelength properties .",
    "_ chandra _ observations revealed an x - ray nucleus in five core galaxies , and all of them are consistent with the correlation linking radio and x - ray emission for rl agns derived by @xcite ( see figure [ lxlr ] ) . moving to the srsic galaxies , two have nuclei detected both in radio and x - ray , while 10 are only detected in the x - ray images .",
    "the location of these sources in the l@xmath19 versus l@xmath20 plane indicates that they are low luminosity rq agns .",
    "these results confirm the relation between optical surface brightness profile and radio loudness @xcite in the sense that core galaxies are associated with rl agns , while non - core galaxies host rq agns .",
    "a consequence of these findings is that , not surprisingly , it is easier to detect the agn emission in the radio band for a rl source and in the x - ray band for a rq agns .",
    "this has an important consequence when we seek for a complete census of agns and consequently of smbhs in a sample of galaxies , since only by combining radio and x - ray data it is possible to cover all agns manifestations .",
    "for example , the presence of an agn in vcc  1226 , the brightest cluster member , is not visible in x - ray images , while it is clearly shown by its radio images .",
    "we presented the results of a radio survey of early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster , extracted from the sample selected by @xcite for their acs virgo cluster survey .",
    "we observed 56 galaxies at 8.4 ghz with the vla that , combined with data from the literature , provide radio images for all 63 galaxies brighter than b@xmath14 .",
    "the aim of this survey is to investigate the origin of radio emission in early - type galaxies and its link with the host properties in an unexplored territory toward the lowest levels of both radio and optical luminosities .",
    "compact radio sources are found in 12 objects , with fluxes from 0.13 to 2700 mjy .",
    "the remaining 51 galaxies are undetected at a flux limit of @xmath10.1 mjy , corresponding to radio luminosities l @xmath21 .",
    "the fraction of radio - detected galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass , in agreement with previous results on the bivariate radio / optical luminosity function of early - type galaxies : while none of the 30 galaxies with m@xmath3 is detected , 8 of the 11 most massive galaxies have radio cores . however , the galaxy mass is not a good predictor of its level of radio emission .",
    "this is clearly seen from a comparison of the radio properties of the brightest galaxies of the vcc .",
    "while they span only a factor of 10 in stellar mass , they cover a range of @xmath22 4.5 orders of magnitude in radio - core power , and three of them are not detected in our radio images .",
    "we note that vcc early - type galaxies with strong dust lanes or of signs of interactions were excluded by the original definition of the sample for the acs virgo cluster survey . considering the links between mergers , dust content and nuclear activity suggested by previous studies of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the sub - sample considered might be biased against active galaxies with respect to the overall population .",
    "this effect , however , does not affect the bright luminosity end , since the sample is complete down to b@xmath13 = 12 .",
    "we examined the possibility of a link between nucleation and radio emission .",
    "core galaxies lack stellar nuclei and show a high incidence of radio nuclei . in the rest of the sample , only two nucleated galaxies show the presence of a radio source .",
    "thus nuclear activity can coexist with a stellar nucleus , but the fraction of active galaxies is not related to nucleation .",
    "we considered the properties of the surface brightness profiles , separating galaxies reproduced by a srsic law from those better described by a core - srsic profile .",
    "furthermore , we relied on the results of x - ray _ chandra _ observations by @xcite to derive a multiwavelength view of the agn emission .",
    "the reported link between optical surface brightness profile and radio loudness @xcite is found also in the vcc sample , since rl agns are associated with core galaxies , while non - core galaxies only host rq agns .",
    "not all radio - detected galaxies have a x - ray nuclear counter part , and vice - versa .",
    "not surprisingly , it is easier to detect the agn emission in the radio band for a rl source and in the x - ray band for a rq agns .",
    "this has an important consequence when we seek for a complete census of agns and consequently of super - massive black holes for which a combination of ( at least ) radio and x - ray data is required .",
    "nonetheless , nuclear emission is not detected in a significant fraction of vcc galaxies in either observing band .",
    "clearly , there is the possibility that the vcc sample crosses the minimum galaxy mass at which a smbh is present ( if such threshold indeed exists ) .",
    "however , there are no signs for the presence of an agn in relatively massive vcc galaxies ( e.g. , vcc  798 and vcc  1720 ) despite the fact that they are expected to host a large smbh ( m@xmath23 ) , based on a typical ratio of 0.002 between smbh and galaxy s mass @xcite .",
    "this is particularly worrisome for a general use of agns as black - hole tracers , considering the proximity of the virgo cluster , the depth and the spatial resolution of the available observations .    in general",
    ", we can not distinguish for the quiescent galaxies between a scenario 1 ) of a transition toward galaxies lacking a smbh due to a low mass threshold , 2 ) the possibility that the smbh has been ejected due to the recoil caused by the coalescence between two black holes following a galaxies merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 3 ) of extremely low accretion rate .    in fact , a crucial role in our ability to detect an active nucleus , and in setting its level of activity ,",
    "is certainly played by the level of accretion onto the central smbh . at least for low - power rl agns , it has shown that a suggestive linear correlation exists between the accretion rate of hot gas ( estimated in a spherical approximation ) and the jet power , over several orders of magnitude @xcite . therefore , to take full advantage of active nuclei as black hole tracers , it is necessary to combine a multiwavelength approach with estimates of the accretion rate .",
    "it is certainly of great interest to explore for example whether the connection between the level of accretion and activity can be extended to the lowest level of radio emission seen in the rl vcc galaxies , and how this compares with similar estimates for rq agns .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her comments that help to improve the paper .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
    "based on observations obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa/ ipac infrared science archive , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "the optical images of two galaxies of the sample ( namely vcc  1030 and vcc  1535 ) both detected in the vla images , show the presence of large - scale dusty disks @xcite that prevent the study and classification of their surface brightness profiles .",
    "we then retrieved from the _ hst _ archive their infrared images where the impact of dust absorption is less severe .",
    "the images were taken with nicmos/_hst _ through the filter f160w ( _ h _ band ) and were processed by the standard _ hst _ pipeline .",
    "the camera nic1 was used , with a pixel size of 0043 , for a field of view of @xmath1 11@xmath24 11 .",
    "elliptical isophotes were fit to both images using the iraf task ` ellipse ' @xcite . although these images are still affected by dust absorption ( see figure [ sbpfig1 ] and [ sbpfig2 ] ) , there are sufficient dust free regions to derive the sbp after proper masking . since the image of vcc  1535 fills completely the field of view , we extended the radial coverage of the sbp using the _ h _ band image from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "the sbp were fit using a srsic law @xcite convolved with the appropriate point - spread function before comparison with the data .",
    "the sbp of vcc  1030 is reproduced very closely by a srsic model with an effective radius of @xmath25 and a srsic index @xmath26 .",
    "this is not the case of vcc  1535 that shows a strong light deficit in the innermost regions with respect to the srsic that describes the external regions and requires the presence of a flat central core .",
    "we therefore fit its sbp with a core - srsic model @xcite ; the parameters of the best fit are an effective radius @xmath27 , an index @xmath28 , a core radius @xmath29 , and a inner slope @xmath30 .",
    "this analysis leads to a classification based on the sbp properties of vcc  1030 as a srsic galaxy and of vcc  1535 as a core - srsic galaxy ."
