    "this was a generalization of the concept of tree - level correction , which was first introduced in the study of the gluon propagator @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : s - imp ] ) and ( [ eq : s - rot ] ) , and using a mean - field improved action , this leads to a dramatic improvement in the ultraviolet behavior of the propagator .",
    "however , the remaining ultraviolet artifacts are sufficiently large to make the results unreliable beyond @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the two improved propagators remain discernibly different even in the infrared , yielding different estimates for the infrared quark mass .    here",
    "we will present results using nonperturbatively determined values for the @xmath0 improvement coefficients , rather than the tree - level and mean - field improved coefficients used in ref .",
    "we will also present two alternative techniques for removing tree - level artifacts and will discuss the relative merits of the three methods .",

    "the sw fermion action , @xmath5 combined with appropriate improvements of operators can be shown @xcite to remove all @xmath0 errors in on - shell matrix elements .",
    "for off - shell quantities such as the quark propagator it is not that simple , and no general proof of @xmath0 improvement is known . indeed , to calculate gauge dependent quantities one might expect to have to introduce gauge non - invariant ( but brst invariant ) terms in the action .",

    "<S> we extend an earlier study of the landau gauge quark propagator in quenched qcd where we used two forms of the @xmath0-improved propagator with the sheikholeslami - wohlert quark action . in the present study we use the nonperturbative value for the clover coefficient @xmath1 and mean - field improvement coefficients in our improved quark propagators . </S>",
    "<S> we compare this to our earlier results which used the mean - field @xmath1 and tree - level improvement coefficients for the propagator . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare three different implementations of tree - level correction : additive , multiplicative , and hybrid . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the hybrid approach is the most robust and reliable and can successfully deal even with strong ultraviolet behavior and zero - crossing of the lattice tree - level expression . </S>",
    "<S> we find good agreement between our improved quark propagators when using the appropriate nonperturbative improvement coefficients and hybrid tree - level correction . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a simple extrapolation of the quark mass function to the chiral limit . </S>"
