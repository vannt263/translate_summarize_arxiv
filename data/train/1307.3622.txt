    "the statistical rice - ramsperger - kassel - marcus ( rrkm)@xcite theory of reaction rates occupies a central place in the field of reaction dynamics both for its elegance and simplicity .",
    "indeed , within the rrkm approximation reaction rates can be calculated@xcite irrespective of the intricate intramolecular dynamics that happen prior to the reaction . in recent years , however , the appearance of several examples@xcite of intrinsically",
    "non - rrkm reactions have rekindled an old question@xcite - when is a system expected to be in the rrkm regime ? from one perspective , answering the question requires understanding the nature of the molecular eigenstates near reaction thresholds .",
    "in particular , the situation wherein all the eigenstates are sufficiently delocalized seems ideal for the validity of the statistical approximation . on the other hand , existence of localized eigenstates at the reaction threshold would suggest strong deviations from the rrkm regime .",
    "consequently , there have been many studies@xcite aiming to characterize the nature of highly excited eigenstates in different systems .",
    "recent reviews@xcite highlight the relationship between eigenstate assignments based on classical phase space structures and deviations from the rrkm regime .    the above arguments , more precisely , are connected to a question that has confounded researchers for nearly a century - what constitutes a quantum analog of the classical ergodic hypothesis in an isolated many body quantum system ?",
    "progress towards answering this question has mainly come from semiclassical analysis of quantum chaotic models@xcite , giving rise to the notions of weak quantum ergodicity@xcite and quantum unique ergodicity@xcite .",
    "recently , an approach that has attracted substantial attention is the so called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth)@xcite . according to eth , for an isolated quantum system governed by the hamiltonian @xmath1 with eigenstates @xmath2 , the eigenstate expectation value @xmath3 of an observable @xmath4 changes slowly and smoothly with the state@xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath5 with the @xmath6 leading term of @xmath7 being the classical microcanonical average@xcite @xmath8d{\\bf q } d{\\bf p}}{\\int   \\delta[h({\\bf q},{\\bf p})-e_{\\alpha}]d{\\bf q } d{\\bf p } } \\label{scdvz}\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath9 is the number of degrees of freedom and @xmath10 is the classical symbol corresponding to the quantum @xmath4 . furthermore , consider the long - time average of the time - dependent expectation value @xmath11 @xmath12 in some initial nonstationary state @xmath13 with mean energy @xmath14 .",
    "since eth implies that @xmath15 is approximately constant in an appropriately chosen energy window of width @xmath16 one can write @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the number of eigenstates within the energy window .",
    "these predictions of eth , along with the effect of finite state space , have been tested in a variety of systems like interacting hard core bosons on lattices@xcite and one - dimensional interacting spin chains@xcite .",
    "the issue of whether all classically nonintegrable quantum systems obey eth is still under debate@xcite .",
    "in particular , many body anderson localization can lead to systems showing both thermalized and localized phases@xcite .",
    "recent studies@xcite show that eth can still hold as long as the various perturbations act homogeneously _",
    "i.e. , _ do not have any specific selection rules , leading to ergodicity over the entire relevant hilbert space .",
    "interestingly , the phenomenon of intramolecular energy flow , which is at the heart of rrkm , has intimate connections@xcite to anderson localization in terms of the state space model@xcite . in the state space model two different classes of initial states called as the edge and interior have different mechanisms for exploring the quantum state space with the dynamics of the former class being dominated by dynamical tunneling@xcite .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of the initial states as determined by the various anharmonic resonances is typically inhomogeneous@xcite , suggesting that eth might be generically violated in effective hamiltonian models describing intramolecular energy flow . in an early work@xcite leitner and",
    "wolynes provided a criterion for quantum ergodicity and have argued that facile energy flow throughout the state space is possible if the interior states are extended .",
    "thus , assuming quantum effects such as dynamical tunneling@xcite can efficiently couple@xcite the edge states to the interior states , one expects that violation of eth for the interior states signals the system being in the non - rrkm regime .    clearly , as evident from eq .",
    "[ ethmat ] and eq .",
    "[ ethcor ] , the central quantities of concern are the various eigenstate expectation values @xmath15 .",
    "there is also a close connection between the @xmath15 and the parametric evolution of energy levels with changing system parameters , also known as level - velocities@xcite . the literature on level - velocities and curvatures as tools to characterize quantum chaos is quite extensive and we refer to only a select few studies here@xcite .",
    "three very early studies , however , are worth mentioning .",
    "the first one is a study@xcite of the highly excited states of the henon - heiles and barbanis hamiltonians using the level - velocity approach by weissman and jortner .",
    "the second study@xcite on the local ergodicity probes in henon - heiles system by ramachandran and kay in fact is an early example of eth .",
    "the third study@xcite by nordholm and rice puts forward a definition of quantum ergodicity which also is very close to the spirit of eth and it is interesting to compare the arguments leading up to their definition with those provided in the more recent work@xcite by rigol and srednicki .",
    "later studies have used the eigenstate expectation values to identify special classes of localized eigenstates in systems with several degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , eigenstate expectation values have been utilized before to dynamically assign the highly excited states of several systems@xcite .",
    "very recently@xcite , using the technique of parametric level motion , hiller et al .",
    "have identified robust states of ultracold bosons in tilted optical lattices coexisting with extensively delocalized states .",
    "existence of such robust few - body bosonic states and dynamically assignable states in molecules are indicative of a lack of statisticality in the system . as an example , in a recent work leitner and gruebele have shown@xcite that significant corrections to the rrkm rates for conformational reactions can be associated with different classes of eigenstates that exist near the reaction threshold . in the molecular context , the eigenstate viewpoint is naturally related to the nature of the intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr ) dynamics at the energies of interest .",
    "thus , jacobson and field have used the time - dependent expectation values of the anharmonic resonances to understand the origins of unusually simple stretch - bend dynamics in acetylene@xcite .    in this work",
    "the eth perspective is utilized to investigate the nature of the eigenstates of thiophosgene ( sccl@xmath0 ) near its dissociation energy ( @xmath19 thz ) .",
    "the motivation for this study comes from the recent work@xcite by chowdary and gruebele wherein they observed sharp assignable features near and above the dissociation energy in the stimulated emission pumping spectra .",
    "previous works@xcite have focused on the nature of the eigenstate and ivr dynamics near the threshold for onset of ivr ( @xmath20 thz ) and have already established the existence of different classes of localized eigenstates and hence nonstatistical ivr dynamics . employing a model spectroscopic hamiltonian",
    "it is shown that localized states do persist persist at energies close to the dissociation energy .",
    "moreover , it is shown that there are special initial states that are robust despite the increased density of states and strong anharmonic couplings .",
    "the hamiltonian used for the current study is a fairly accurate effective hamiltonian for sccl@xmath0 constructed@xcite by sibert and gruebele using canonical van vleck perturbation theory and can be expressed as @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the zeroth - order anharmonic hamiltonian and the various anharmonic resonances , coupling the zeroth - order states , are contained in @xmath23 in the above expression , the operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 are lowering and raising operators for the @xmath26 mode respectively with @xmath27=1 $ ] , in analogy to the usual harmonic oscillator operators .",
    "note that there are other much weaker resonances in the hamiltonian which are ignored in the current study .",
    "the above hamiltonian has effectively three degrees of freedom due to the existence of three , approximately , conserved quantities or polyads @xmath28 therefore @xmath29 is block diagonal and in the present work the focus is on @xmath30 block which has a total of @xmath31 eigenstates spanning an energy range of about @xmath32 @xmath33 . note that chowdary and gruebele used the above hamiltonian to perform an extensive study of the vibrational state space and concluded@xcite that about @xmath34 in @xmath35 zeroth - order states are localized near the dissociation energy . in",
    "what follows , for convenience , we will refer to the resonances by the highlighting the modes involved .",
    "thus , the first term in eq .  [ qham ] will be referred to as the @xmath36-resonance .    the classical hamiltonian corresponding to eq .  [ qham ] can be expressed@xcite in terms of action - angle variables as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the zeroth - order hamiltonian and the resonant perturbations given by @xmath39 in the above equations the actions @xmath40 are conserved , being the classical analogs of the quantum polyads , and hence @xmath41 is ignorable in the conjugate angles @xmath42 .",
    "the parameters @xmath43 of the reduced hamiltonian ( not given here ) are related to the original parameters via the canonical transformation and the reader is referred to a previous work for details@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the overlap of nonlinear resonances in eq .",
    "[ nonlinres ] render the classical system nonintegrable with the possibility of extensive chaos in the classical phase space .",
    "belonging to the polyad @xmath30 .",
    "both measures are computed in the zeroth - order number basis .",
    "the region indicated by gray rectangle comprises of the most delocalized eigenstates.,width=288,height=336 ]",
    "we begin this section by computing two measures@xcite for eigenstate delocalization that are well known .",
    "the first quantity is the participation ratio @xmath44 which is a measure of the total number of basis states @xmath45 that participate in making up the eigenstate @xmath2 .",
    "a second quantity is the information or shannon entropy of an eigenstate given by the expression @xmath46 note that the maximal@xcite @xmath47 for a gaussian orthogonal ensemble which has the value of @xmath48 since in our case @xmath49 .",
    "it is also useful to observe that in eq .",
    "[ ethcor ] if we choose @xmath50 then @xmath51 is the dilution factor associated with @xmath52 and assuming eth one has @xmath53 .    in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "the measures @xmath54 and @xmath55 are shown for all the eigenstates computed in the basis of the zeroth - order states _",
    "i.e. , _ eigenstates of @xmath56 . as expected both measures agree and indicate localized states at the low and high end of the spectrum . the middle part  @xmath57 @xmath33 of the spectrum has states exhibiting large values for both the measures",
    ". however , note that @xmath55 in particular does not become maximal even in this complicated energy range .",
    "thus , although one expects that even at this high energy the eigenstates are not maximally delocalized , the origin of such partial localization are not apparent from the results .        in order to gain more detailed insights we compute the eigenstate expectation values of the various resonance operators in eq .",
    "[ qham ] and compare them to the classical microcanonical average computed in the @xmath58 reduced representation using the expression @xmath59 d{\\bf j}d{\\bm \\psi}}{\\int \\delta[h({\\bf j},{\\bm \\psi})-e ] d{\\bf j}d{\\bm \\psi}}\\ ] ]",
    "the results , shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , clearly show considerable fluctuations of the @xmath15 about the @xmath60 and imply the existence of several localized eigenstates .",
    "note that strongly localized states are seen , in agreement with figure  [ fig1 ] , at both the low and high energy regions of the polyad . however , now it is possible to ascribe the low and high energy localized states with the @xmath61-resonance and a combination of the @xmath62 and @xmath36 anharmonic resonances respectively .",
    "particularly striking is the @xmath61-resonance case at low energies exhibiting rather large quantum expectation values .",
    "in fact , following previous works@xcite , one can analyze the single integrable @xmath61-nonlinear resonance term in eq .",
    "[ nonlinres ] @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 being constants .",
    "the analysis yields the extremal values for the quantum expectations as @xmath66 with @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "decent agreement of the above estimate with the computed values for the first few states shown in figure  [ fig2 ] suggests that even around @xmath70 thz above ground state the classical phase space of sccl@xmath0 has a large regular region capable of supporting several regular quantum states . using previously established techniques@xcite it is possible to provide dynamical assignments for a number of states at the low and high end of the polyad .",
    "however , we do not attempt this here .",
    "instead we focus on the @xmath57 @xmath33 part of the polyad shown in figure  [ fig1 ] in order to check the extent of deviation from eth in this region .",
    "the results in figure  [ fig2 ] show the strong fluctuations about the classical microcanonical average suggesting deviations from ergodicity .",
    "however , as suggested by pechukas@xcite , the diagonal matrix elements @xmath15 are expected to have quantum fluctuations which are of the same order of magnitude as the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath71 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see if the deviations seen in the complicated @xmath57 @xmath33 region in figure  [ fig2 ] are essentially the expected quantum fluctuations . as discussed by feingold and",
    "peres the computation of the quantum fluctuations in @xmath15 is rather involved and related to the classical autocorrelation of the relevant observables@xcite .",
    "one approach is to model the distribution of @xmath72 by a gaussian as in the earlier work@xcite .",
    "however , in this work we take a more stringent constraint and associate the extent of quantum fluctuation of @xmath15 with the largest off - diagonal matrix element @xmath73 .",
    "typically , the largest such element is found to be close to the diagonal .    in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the complicated region of the polyad with the expected quantum fluctuations in @xmath15 at specific points .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig3 ] that despite the near constant values for the various @xmath15 there are several states ( highlighted by boxes ) that indeed deviate strongly from the microcanonical average .",
    "interestingly , many of these states are not easily identifiable from figure  [ fig1 ] since both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are not capable of identifying localization in the phase space .",
    "hence , figure  [ fig3 ] clearly establishes the power of the approach based on eigenstate expectation values .",
    "note that different resonance operators reveal different localized eigenstates in a complementary fashion .",
    "for instance , a localized state with large negative expectation value for the @xmath61-resonance in figure  [ fig3 ] is not easily identifiable from any of the other expectation values .",
    "although not shown here , we have further confirmed the predictions of figure  [ fig3 ] by studying the semiclassical angle space representation@xcite @xmath74 of the eigenstates .",
    "the eth result in eq .  [ ethcor ] essentially depends on the lack of correlation between the intensities @xmath75 and the expectation values @xmath15 .",
    "thus , are the results in figure  [ fig3 ] contrary to the eth expectations ? in this context it is interesting to note that a sensitive measure for violations from ergodicity called as the intensity - velocity correlator was introduced earlier by tomsovic@xcite and has been applied to several paradigmatic systems@xcite .",
    "this measure correlates the intensity @xmath76 of some probe state @xmath77 and the parametric evolution of the eigenvalues ( level velocities ) as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a hamiltonian parameter of interest . in the second line of eq .",
    "[ intvelcor ] the quantities are scaled to unit variance and the level - velocities are zero centered to remove any net drift .",
    "the averaging above is done over a window @xmath16 consisting of @xmath18 states with @xmath80 and @xmath81 being the local variances of the intensities and level - velocities respectively .",
    "as defined eq .",
    "[ intvelcor ] is expected to be large for eigenstates exhibiting common localization characteristics with levels moving in the same direction with changing parameter value .",
    "moreover , one can show that in the random matrix theory ( rmt ) limit the correlator vanishes for every @xmath77 up to fluctuations depending on the number of states within the energy window _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath82 . in this work , however , we will use the covariance instead of the correlator since @xmath83 and @xmath84 are also influenced by the classical phase space structures .",
    "consequently , interpretation of @xmath85 needs to be done with some care@xcite .",
    "moreover , using the covariance is closer to the spirit of eq .",
    "[ ethcor ] and suffices for our work .",
    "in addition , note that an earlier work@xcite of heller on the rate of exploration of phase space utilizes the strength function , which is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation @xmath86 , as the central quantity .",
    "the @xmath85 is essentially the parametric response of the strength function@xcite and , as seen below , connects very naturally to the eth perspective .    to make contact with eth we choose the parameter in eq",
    "[ intvelcor ] as one of the resonance strengths in eq .",
    "[ qham ] , say @xmath87 , and the initial state as the zeroth - order number state @xmath52 . then , using the hellman - feynman theorem , the covariance can be written down as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the window average of @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , one has measures for every anharmonic resonance in the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , as the expectations are zero - centered , eth as in eq .",
    "[ ethcor ] implies that @xmath91 for every choice of @xmath52 . on the contrary ,",
    "nonzero values for @xmath92 yield a quantitative measure of the deviations from ergodicity .",
    "we now choose two zeroth - order states @xmath93 and @xmath94 with energies @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath33 respectively in the range appropriate to figure  [ fig3 ] and compute the intensity - velocity covariance for each resonance operator .",
    "the energy windows are centered at their respective @xmath97 with widths @xmath98 determined by the energy uncertainty @xmath99 ( @xmath100 @xmath33 for both states ) . within the selected window",
    "there are about @xmath101 eigenstates and the respective classical microcanonical expectations are nearly constant ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "hence , the classical phase space is not expected to change much over the averaging window .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] and clearly indicate deviations from ergodicity .",
    "as expected , the @xmath61-resonance plays an important role for both the states . however , localization due to the @xmath36 and the @xmath102 resonances are also observed .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath61-resonance can be understood from the parametric evolution of the eigenvalues shown in figure  [ fig4 ] with varying resonance strength .",
    "several states exhibiting linear parametric motion (  solitonic \" states@xcite ) can be seen amidst a sea of avoided crossings .",
    "such solitonic states are the robust localized states , also seen exhibiting large fluctuations in figure  [ fig3 ] , resulting in the strong deviations from ergodicity as measured by the covariance .",
    "a final remark is in order at this stage regarding the choice of the two specific zeroth - order states chosen in figure  [ fig4 ] . in their recent work@xcite chowdary and gruebele",
    "associated the sharp sep features ( @xmath103 thz ) with zeroth - order states of the form @xmath104 with @xmath105 being typically rather small ( @xmath106 as seen in a later work@xcite ) in comparison to the other mode occupancies .",
    "although the states chosen here have the same form , the @xmath105 occupancies being large makes them strongly susceptible to the @xmath61-resonance and hence fragmented in the sep spectra .",
    "however , such states are fragmented much less compared to the states at similar energies but with occupancy in the @xmath107 and @xmath108 modes . for example , the zeroth order state @xmath109 with @xmath110 @xmath33 is diluted by nearly an order of magnitude more as compared to the state @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the results in figure  [ fig4 ] showing considerable localization at these high energies are compatible with the findings of chowdary and gruebele@xcite .    ) for two zeroth - order states @xmath111 ( black ) and @xmath94 ( red ) . the resonant operators chosen to compute the covariances are indicated .",
    "( a ) intensity spectra of the two states showing the fractionation due to resonances .",
    "( b ) classical microcanonical averages of the resonances vary very little over the energy window corresponding to the @xmath93 state .",
    "right panel shows the parametric evolution of the eigenvalues ( level - velocities ) upon varying the @xmath61-resonance strength .",
    "actual resonance strength is indicated by a vertical red line.,width=336,height=288 ]",
    "in this work we have shown that several eigenstates of sccl@xmath0 exhibit localization even near the dissociation threshold . such ` nonthermalized '",
    "states are identified using sensitive and quantitative measures for deviations from ergodicity .",
    "consequently , the dynamics at these energies should exhibit deviations from rrkm predictions .",
    "however , as pointed out in an earlier work@xcite , observing the deviations from rrkm depends on whether the optically accessible states have sufficient overlaps with the partially localized eigenstates or not . in other words ,",
    "experimentally prepared initial states which have significant overlaps with partially localized eigenstates are bound to have nonstatistical dynamics since the eigenstates encode the infinite time energy flow dynamics of the system .",
    "although the converse statement _ i.e. , _ validity of eth implies rrkm is yet to be established , the important studies@xcite by nordholm and rice does lead us to believe that it is reasonable to expect so .",
    "it is also relevant to note that the present work is an example of a system wherein the integrability breaking perturbations do have specific selection rules and hence testing the eth in a more complex situation@xcite .",
    "the techniques used here are very general and not limited by the dimensionality of the system .",
    "the intensity - velocity correlator used in this study is not only capable of identifying localized states but also singles out the relevant perturbations that lead to localization .",
    "note that the eigenstate expectation values play a key role in both eth and the matrix fluctuation - dissipation ( mfd ) approach@xcite of gruebele .",
    "hence , a better understanding of the connection between the two should be useful in gaining fundamental classical - quantum correspondence insights into the dynamics and control of ivr .",
    "finally , it would be of some interest to determine the exact nature of the relation between eth on one hand , and the logan - wolynes transition criterion@xcite , and the leitner - wolynes quantum ergodicity criterion@xcite , which includes the dynamical tunneling effects , on the other hand ."
