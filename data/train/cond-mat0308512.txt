    "vortex arrays ( va s ) in type ii superconductors are exemplary systems to study non - equilibrium states of driven periodic media in various pinning environments .",
    "a particularly interesting phenomenon in this context is that of a dynamic transition from an elastic , coherent flow state at large velocities to a plastic , incoherent flow state at small velocities . the first theoretical description of this issue was provided by koshelev and vinokur ( kv ) @xcite and refined in subsequent studies @xcite which predicted various novel flow states , including a moving glass characterized by elastically coupled chains oriented along the flow direction and a moving transverse smectic with decoupled flow chains . such structures and the dynamic transitions between them have been extensively studied in a number of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "experimentally , a diversity of flow states has been reported in direct imaging experiments on nbse@xmath7 crystals @xcite .",
    "however , quantitatively the effect of pinning strength and/or temperature on the ordering velocity has been studied only through dc transport experiments @xcite , based on the assumption that an inflection point in dc current - voltage ( @xmath8 ) curve ( i.e. a peak in differential resistance ) marks the dynamic transition .",
    "recently , different explanations have been given as the reason for such inflection point , like macroscopic coexistence of two phases @xcite and a change in the self organized , large scale morphology of vortex rivers @xcite .",
    "thus , a more direct , microscopic probe is required to study systematically the velocity , magnetic field and temperature dependence of dynamic ordering .",
    "recently , we reported on the use of mode - locking ( ml ) experiments as a direct probe of ordering @xcite .",
    "the ml phenomenon occurs due to coupling between , on the one hand , collective lattice modes of frequency @xmath9 , with @xmath10 an integer and @xmath11 the lattice periodicity , which occur when a va moves coherently with velocity @xmath12 through a pinning potential @xcite , and , on the other hand , a superimposed rf - drive of frequency @xmath13 at an integer fraction @xmath14 of @xmath15 .",
    "this coupling produces steps in the dc - transport ( @xmath8 ) curves when @xmath16 @xcite , similar to ml steps in sliding charge density waves ( cdw s ) @xcite and giant shapiro steps in josephson junction arrays @xcite .",
    "however , on decreasing the velocity @xmath12 or increasing the temperature , incoherent velocity fluctuations due to quenched and thermal disorder suppress the collective lattice mode and reduce the width of the ml steps .",
    "approaching the regime of fully plastic or liquid flow , the ml amplitude eventually vanishes @xcite and the ml frequency @xmath2 at which this occurs provides a _ direct _ measure of the ordering velocity : @xmath17 .",
    "the particular system of our studies consists of mesoscopic flow channels in a disordered , strong pinning environment @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the samples is sketched in figs . [ fig1](a),(b ) .",
    "vortices inside the channels are confined by strongly pinned vortices in the channel edges ( ce s ) . when a force is applied along the channel , the shear interaction with these ce vortices",
    "provides the dominant pinning mechanism impeding the channel flow .",
    "further , since the natural lattice ( row ) spacing is @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , on varying the magnetic field @xmath20 one can go through a series of structural transitions from @xmath21 to @xmath22 vortex rows in the channel ( typically @xmath23 ) .",
    "besides its relevance for the study of ( dynamic ) structural transitions of vortex matter in quenched disorder , the physics of this system is also closely related to layering transitions in confined fluids , flow of colloids in mesopores and mesoscopic friction .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have given a short account of the interesting phenomena which this system displays .",
    "firstly , due to the structural transitions , the dc - critical current for channel flow ( yield strength ) oscillates with field as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) . at a given field ,",
    "the dc @xmath8 ( force - velocity ) curve _ with _ superimposed rf - current exhibits the ml effect , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](c ) .",
    "the ml condition in this case attains a form which is particularly useful to study the structural transitions .",
    "the voltage @xmath24 at which the fundamental(@xmath25 ) ml step occurs is given by @xcite : @xmath26 with @xmath27 the flux quantum , @xmath28 the number of channels measured simultaneously and @xmath21 the _ number of coherently moving chains _ in each channel .    as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) , on changing field , @xmath24 increases as a staircase , directly reflecting the evolution of @xmath21 with field . a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) shows that at mismatch fields , i.e. where a transition @xmath29 occurs and @xmath21 and @xmath30 steps may coexist , the yield strength @xmath31 is maximum , whereas around the center of the @xmath24 plateau , where an @xmath21 row configuration matches the channel width , it is minimum . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this phenomenon is caused by positional disorder ( roughness ) of the vortex configuration in the ce s : first of all , on moving away from the matching field this disorder enhances transverse fluctuations of vortex chains in the array , impeding the flow . secondly ,",
    "close to mismatch , part of the ( moving ) @xmath21-chain regions within each channel may switch to @xmath30 . in between the @xmath21 and @xmath30 regions quasi - static fault zones with misaligned dislocations",
    "develop where the vortex trajectories are jammed .",
    "we note that the presence of degrees of freedom transverse to the average flow velocity , both in our system and vortex lattices in general , forms an important difference with cdw s .",
    "particularly , for cdw s the displacement ( phase ) field is a scalar @xmath32 and the velocity @xmath33 represents longitudinal motion only .",
    "our system , when compared to regular vortex lattices , has the unique property that the transverse response can be tuned .    in this paper we study in detail the ml step width as function of the rf - amplitude and frequency .",
    "the experiments provide important information on the dynamic coherence of the arrays and how this coherency varies with mismatch and flow velocity .",
    "we focus on ml in the regime where @xmath34 , but our findings are representative for other transitions with limited @xmath35 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sectheory ] we first review previous theoretical results on ml at high frequency and then present simulation results of a one dimensional ( 1d ) vortex chain to show the full frequency dependence of ml in a system with only elastic deformations . in sec .",
    "[ secexperimental ] we describe the details of our sample and the experimental procedure .",
    "the experimental results are presented in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] .",
    "we find clear evidence for an _ ordering",
    "_ frequency @xmath2 below which no ml occurs .",
    "furthermore , from the ml data we extract the pinning frequency @xmath1 and the total length @xmath5 of coherently moving 3-row regions .",
    "these quantities systematically change with magnetic field : at matching , where @xmath5 is large , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both small , while at mismatch where @xmath5 is small , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are enhanced .",
    "we find that @xmath6 , independent of magnetic field . in sec .",
    "[ secdiscus ] we compare these results with the ordering theory of koshelev and vinokur , and discuss the implications for the microscopic nature of the flow and the ordering phenomena .",
    "the velocity ( or frequency ) dependence of the ml step width is particularly useful as a direct probe of dynamic ordering . at present , the ml step width has been studied theoretically only in the high frequency limit , where perturbation theory allows to obtain an analytical description @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36d displacement field @xmath37 of an elastic vortex lattice driven through a pinning environment by combined rf and dc external forces is ( at @xmath38 ) : @xmath39 with @xmath40 the friction coefficient with @xmath41 the flux flow resistivity .",
    "@xmath42 is a driving force per unit length consisting of dc and rf terms ; @xmath43@xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the dc and rf current densities , respectively .",
    "@xmath47 is the elastic restoring force given by @xmath48 $ ] with @xmath49 and @xmath50 the compression and shear moduli , respectively @xcite . in absence of the pinning force @xmath51 ,",
    "the lattice is undistorted and flows uniformly : @xmath52@xmath53 with an ac velocity @xmath54 , i.e. proportional to the rf - drive .      at high velocities where the friction term dominates the pinning term in eq.([motion ] )",
    ", one can treat the pinning as a perturbation with respect to the undisturbed rf - dc velocity @xmath55 .",
    "we distinguish two cases , namely a periodic pinning potential and a random pinning potential . in case of a periodic potential with periodicities equal to that of the lattice ,",
    "elastic deformations are absent ( @xmath47=0 ) and the whole lattice behaves as a single particle with overdamped dynamics in a sinusoidal potential . at large drive",
    "this case is described analogous to a voltage biased , resistively shunted josephson junction @xcite : substituting @xmath56 in eq.([motion ] ) and assuming @xmath57 with @xmath58 the maximum slope of the potential and @xmath59 , one can show that as first order correction a step anomaly appears in the dc velocity - force characteristics at the ml condition @xmath60 .",
    "the current density width of the @xmath61th step oscillates with the rf - drive according to @xmath62 with @xmath63 the critical current density and @xmath64 the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath61 .",
    "note that no subharmonic ml ( @xmath65 ) occurs in this model .",
    "turning to a vl in a purely random potential , the first order perturbation correction has zero mean .",
    "the second order correction is the lowest order of perturbation that provides the ml step .",
    "taking into account the lattice distortions due to the random pinning within the elastic limit , schmidt and hauger @xcite showed that the ml step can appear at both harmonic and subharmonic ml conditions @xmath66 and that the associated width of the current density step is : @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the component of the critical current density related to the fourier transform of the random potential correlator at wave vector @xmath70 .",
    "thus , for random pinning the ml step width exhibits a squared bessel - function oscillation with the rf drive . in the following",
    "we omit the subscripts @xmath61 and @xmath10 in the ml step width since we will discuss only the fundamental ml phenomenon for @xmath25 ( where @xmath71 will be justified in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] ) .",
    "we note here that in our case @xmath11 can be a frustrated lattice spacing opposed to the natural one in @xcite .",
    "it is clear in eqs.([periodic ] ) and ( [ random1 ] ) that the dependence on frequency and rf drive only appear in the argument @xmath72 of the bessel functions , irrespective of the type of pinning . choosing @xmath73 by varying the rf - amplitude such that @xmath74 is maximum , the characteristic maximum value of the fundamental ml width at high frequency is @xmath75 @xmath76 for periodic and random pinning , respectively .",
    "these perturbational results are only applicable for frequencies ( much ) above the so - called pinning frequency @xmath1 . for a sinusoidal pinning potential",

    "are a useful tool to obtain the theoretical value of the fundamental ml width @xcite .",
    "to obtain @xmath83 vs. @xmath13 for the case of completely elastic motion in our channel system , we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of an rf - dc driven 1d _",

    "the channel width @xmath84 , i.e. the ( average ) spacing between the first pinned rows is @xmath85 .",
    "vortex interactions were modelled by the london potential with @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the penetration depth ) and the average vortex spacing @xmath11 in the channel was chosen equal to that in the ce s , @xmath88 .",

    "a qualitative comparison of the data with the theoretical predictions eq.([random1 ] ) ( solid line ) and eq.([periodic ] ) ( dotted line ) shows that the data follows more closely a @xmath129 than a @xmath130 dependence . at @xmath131",
    "it is found that @xmath132 over a broad frequency range between @xmath1 and @xmath133 mhz ( above this frequency the experimental error in @xmath124 becomes larger ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with eq.([random1 ] ) which has a maximum at @xmath134 .",
    "it is important to note that while the values of the rf - current might appear rather large , the actual vortex displacements due to the rf - drive at or below the first maximum in @xmath135 , are less than @xmath136 of the lattice spacing .",
    "the @xmath135 behavior shows that the pinning potential due to the vortices in the ce acts as a random potential ( rp)@xcite . the origin of the rp is the strong positional disorder of the vortex lattice in the nbn edge material .",
    "this disorder has recently been observed in scanning tunnelling microscopy experiments on nbn films @xcite .",
    "we further note that we did not observe subharmonic ml steps , i.e. there were no ml steps at @xmath137 with @xmath138 . in the context of our rp",
    "this seems in contradiction to the results of others @xcite . but",
    "those experiments have been carried out at relatively low fields where the rp has short range correlations on a scale @xmath139 .",
    "fourier components @xmath70 with @xmath138 are needed to describe such short range fluctuations and therefore subharmonic ml steps are seen . in our case , the rp is due to the ce vortices which have average spacing @xmath140 .",
    "consequently the most important fourier component describing this rp is the @xmath71 mode , which explains why we do not see subharmonic ml steps .",
    "next we turn to the frequency dependence of @xmath128 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows @xmath141 at @xmath142 mt obtained from measurements similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] at various frequencies . as in the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , @xmath128 saturates at a value @xmath143 @xmath58a at high frequencies , while at low frequencies it decreases monotonically with @xmath13 .",
    "a large part of the data is well approximated by the empirical function discussed in the previous section , @xmath144tanh(@xmath145 , and we can extract the pinning frequency @xmath1=7.8mhz as the remaining fit parameter .",
    "however , at low frequency ( i.e. small dc - velocity ) the data lie significantly below the empirical curve .",
    "this implies that the vortex motion becomes less coherent due to the disordered ce s . on reducing @xmath13",
    ", @xmath128 vanishes almost linearly at a _ finite _",
    "frequency @xmath2 determined by the intersection between the dotted line and the @xmath146 axis . in this regime , the rf - current for which @xmath117 exhibits its maximum value , starts to saturate at a value @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "the collapse of @xmath128 at finite frequency @xmath2 is even more clearly visible in the data taken at @xmath119mt shown in the inset to fig .",
    "below @xmath2 no ml step appears at _ any rf drive _ , indicating the complete absence of coherent @xmath0-row motion .",
    "the above fitting analysis was performed on @xmath141 data taken at various fields in the @xmath121 field regime and we extracted @xmath1 , @xmath148 and the dynamic ordering frequency @xmath2 . we first discuss the results of @xmath1 and @xmath149 as a function of magnetic field , shown in fig . [ fig5](b ) .",
    "as observed , @xmath1 has a minimum at @xmath150 mt , somewhat below the middle of the plateau in @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , and it increases on approaching either end of the plateau .",
    "hence , the associated pinning current density in the coherent @xmath0-chain regions @xmath151 is small at @xmath150 mt and increases away from @xmath150 mt .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath151 as determined from @xmath1 using eq.([pinningfrandom ] ) agrees within @xmath152 with @xmath89 as determined directly from dc-@xmath8 curves , fig . [ fig1](e ) .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath149 exhibits a field dependence which differs considerably from that of @xmath1 : it has a broad peak around @xmath153 mt and then decreases with increasing field .",
    "clearly , this behavior can not be explained by simply assuming @xmath154 .    at this point",
    "we note that theory assumes all vortices in the channel are moving coherently .",
    "however , in our experiment only a fraction of the vortices move coherently . specifically , an @xmath21-row region may locally break up due to the strong edge disorder or it may coexists with @xmath155-row regions ( with different ml voltages ) due to mismatch @xcite .",
    "we define the total length of mode - locked regions with @xmath0 coherently moving rows as @xmath5 and the mode - locked fraction as @xmath4 .",
    "since only the coherent @xmath21-row regions contribute to @xmath149 , we can link the value of @xmath149 to that of @xmath156 by using @xmath157 . in this expression @xmath158",
    "can be obtained from the measured pinning frequency via eq.([pinningfrandom ] ) and ( [ maximumjrandom ] ) .",
    "using @xmath40 the result for @xmath5 is given by @xmath159 the different field dependencies of @xmath149 and @xmath1 mentioned above should thus be attributed to an additional field dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "we now evaluate @xmath5 using @xmath41 for amorphous nbge films @xcite and first assume an equilibrium lattice spacing @xmath160 with @xmath161 .",
    "figure [ fig2](c ) shows @xmath5 normalized by the channel length @xmath162 vs. field ( square symbols ) .",
    "as observed , the coherently moving fraction is maximum at @xmath163 mt .",
    "this provides a clear definition of the matching field @xmath164 for @xmath121 . at @xmath164 , the longitudinal spacing @xmath11 in the channel",
    "should obey @xmath165 and the row spacing @xmath166 is commensurate with the effective channel width , i.e. @xmath167 .",
    "however , away from the matching field the array will be frustrated ( stretched or compressed ) due to the confinement .",
    "in particular , for @xmath168 the lattice spacing @xmath169 , while for @xmath170 , @xmath171 . the maximum possible difference between @xmath11 and @xmath172 would be achieved when the row spacing @xmath173 would not change with mismatch , i.e. @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "this would imply @xmath175 . inserting this relation for @xmath11 in eq.([l ] ) , the result for @xmath5 , shown by the open circles , is slightly modified but shows essentially the same behavior as our first analysis : upon increasing the frustration , which we define as @xmath176 , the spatial extent of regions with @xmath0 coherently moving rows shrinks progressively .",
    "an additional analysis of the @xmath122 ml steps which occur at lower fields ( @xmath177mt , where the transition @xmath178 takes place ) , shows consistently that the spatial extent of the @xmath36 row ml regions increases upon further decreasing field .",
    "finally we discuss the behavior of the ordering frequency @xmath2 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , @xmath179 , denoted by ( @xmath180 ) , exhibits a minimum at the matching field and systematically increases with mismatch .",
    "similarly to the decay of @xmath5 with increasing frustration , this shows that a larger mismatch progressively induces more disorder .",
    "we also find that , when the field is reduced below @xmath181 mt , where a @xmath36-row configuration first appears , the ordering frequency @xmath182 for the emergence of the @xmath122 ml effect decreases .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior of @xmath2 is similar to that of the pinning frequency @xmath1 ( or @xmath183 ) .",
    "both are important quantities characterizing the random pinning of a system and are not independent , as follows from a double logarithmic plot of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 , shown in fig .",
    "the data are well described by the relation @xmath184 with @xmath185 s , represented by the dashed line .",
    "a more detailed fit of the data using a power law relation @xmath186 yields an exponent @xmath187 .",
    "for a proper discussion of the above results , we first shortly describe the phenomenological ordering theory of koshelev and vinokur ( kv ) @xcite . in their study of a 2d vortex system with strong random bulk",
    "pinning , they found that the shaking action due to motion through the pinning potential can be represented by a shaking temperature @xmath188 which decreases with velocity as @xmath189 .",
    "the dynamic ordering transition occurs when the effective temperature @xmath190 is reduced below the equilibrium melting temperature @xmath191 , i.e. when the velocity exceeds @xmath192 . in later work @xcite it was shown that the shaking temperature refers to ( bond ) fluctuations transverse to the velocity and that the associated ordering at @xmath193 corresponds to so called transverse freezing , where inter - chain excursions ( permeation modes ) are strongly suppressed . within the kv theory",
    "we can express the ordering frequency @xmath194 as : @xmath195 with @xmath196 the mean squared @xmath197 pinning energy multiplied by the area of a pin , @xmath41 the flux flow resistivity , @xmath11 the lattice spacing and @xmath111 the film thickness .    in our channel system",
    "the ordering can also be described as transverse freezing .",
    "we observed this in simulations ( e.g. for @xmath198 ) as a suppression of the inter - chain excursions in parts of the channel at sufficient velocity @xcite .",
    "however , different from the @xmath36d system considered by kv , these inter - chain excursions and the associated shaking temperature now arise from the random interaction with the disordered vortices in the ce s and a modification of eq.([ordfreq ] ) is required .",
    "thinking in terms of bond fluctuations or a lindemann criterion , as in @xcite , it is clear that it is the short wavelength @xmath199 disorder component in the potential due to quenched vortex displacements @xmath200 in the ce which is relevant for the shaking temperature. this component acts only in a range @xmath201 from the first pinned row @xcite , therefore shaking of the outer rows should govern the transverse freezing . a rough estimate within london theory yields an rms - amplitude of the random stress near the edge @xmath202 with @xmath50 the shear modulus and @xmath203 representing the random strain @xcite .",
    "taking the longitudinal range of a pin also to be @xmath204 , we replace the parameter @xmath196 in eq.([ordfreq ] ) by @xmath205 , resulting in : @xmath206    further it is important to realize the following : the energy scale @xmath207 in eq.([ordfreq ] ) should be regarded as the energy for creation of the dislocation pairs that are required for plastic motion i.e. @xmath208 , with @xmath50 evaluated at the field and temperature of the measurement @xcite . for our temperature and fields , this energy @xmath209 is two orders of magnitude larger than the thermal energy @xmath210 which we can therefore neglect in eq.([ordfreq ] ) .",
    "hence , the random shaking ( @xmath211 ) in our case essentially represents cold working of the moving structure .",
    "we also anticipate that the energy @xmath209 should depend on the matching condition since a reduction of this energy eventually drives the transition to @xmath122 or @xmath123 rows .",
    "therefore we add a mismatch dependent factor @xmath212 : @xmath213 , where @xmath212 is assumed to be @xmath214 at matching .",
    "taking into account these changes , eq.([ordfreq ] ) becomes @xmath215 using the experimental parameters with @xmath216 and @xmath217 k@xmath218 @xmath58 m , we obtain the value of @xmath219 from the value of @xmath2 at matching : @xmath220 , i.e. @xmath221 .",
    "this is in very reasonable agreement with our estimate ( @xmath222 ) near the melting temperature in @xcite . from eq.([ordfreqmod ] ) and the @xmath2 data in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) we can also extract the field dependence of @xmath212 characterizing the reduction of the defect creation energy .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , showing that close to mismatch @xmath212 has decreased by an order of magnitude .",
    "next , we turn to the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the dc - critical current density can be described phenomenologically by @xcite : @xmath223 where in our case @xmath224 varies from @xmath225 at matching to @xmath226 at mismatch , see the open squares in fig .",
    "further , when we combine eqs.([ordfreq ] ) , ( [ gamma ] ) , eq.([phenomenologicaljc ] ) with eq.([pinningfrandom ] ) and use @xmath40 , we obtain the quadratic relation @xmath227 observed experimentally in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] with the timescale @xmath228 given by : @xmath229 since @xmath230 and experimentally we found that @xmath231 s , independent of field , this implies that @xmath232 . using this relation with the field dependent value of @xmath212",
    ", we obtain @xmath224 as shown by the open circles in fig .",
    "the minima in both data are slightly shifted and deviations are seen for @xmath233 , but given the approximations made , the overall agreement is still reasonable .",
    "an important physical implication of the relation @xmath234 is that the increase in pinning strength away from matching is directly related to the reduction of the defect creation energy . in other words ,",
    "the rise in @xmath224 reflects an effective _ softening _ of the array in the channel upon increasing mismatch . through this softening",
    "it is able to better adjust to the random ce pinning potential , very much analogous to the mechanism responsible for the peak - effect in ordinary superconductors @xcite . in our case",
    "a more detailed picture of the softening mechanism is possible .",
    "we already mentioned that for @xmath170 , the chains are longitudinally compressed ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "this will facilitate deviations in the transverse direction and reduce the energy to ( dynamically ) create interstitials between rows . for @xmath168 ,",
    "the chains are stretched , i.e. @xmath169 . in this case",
    "the energy for a chain to accept vortices from a neighboring chain is lowered . this in turn facilitates a configurational change in which the array can better adopt to the ce potential .",
    "an additional mechanism for the rise in @xmath224 for @xmath236 is that , due to the mismatch , the outer chains will be pushed towards the ce , leading to an enhanced influence of the ce potential .    to conclude this section , we want to mention that the relation @xmath6 is not specific to our channels , but can be obtained as a general result from the kv theory in the strong pinning limit .",
    "so far we have tacitly assumed that the flow behavior obtained from our rf - dc measurements simply reflects that of the dc - driven structure .",
    "we now discuss to what extent the additional rf - current itself influences the behavior .",
    "recent measurements of the rf - impedance @xcite , which is a sensitive probe of ml at small rf - currents , have shown that on approaching the dc - driven state , i.e. when @xmath237 , the voltage broadening @xmath238 of the fundamental ml step diverges . since @xmath239 ,",
    "this broadening reflects fluctuations in the washboard frequency and , via @xmath240 , fluctuations in the velocity and in the longitudinal lattice spacing @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the divergence of @xmath238 implies that the dc - driven state lacks temporal coherence .",
    "we also did not observe any narrow band noise in the voltage spectrum of the dc - driven state ( even for only @xmath241 channels at large dc - drive ) . at the same time",
    ", @xmath242 remains constant for @xmath243 , from which we conclude that the dc - state still exhibits local regions organized in @xmath0 moving chains .",
    "thus , at sufficient velocity the dc - state would correspond to temporally incoherent , confined smectic regions @xcite of finite ( mismatch dependent ) length , with liquid - like intra chain order and residual inter - chain excursions .    in presence of rf - current",
    "the fluctuations are strongly reduced , as also observed in experiments on cdw s @xcite . in simulations we observed that the suppression of the inter - chain excursions plays an important role in this process , causing _",
    "transversely frozen _ regions in the channel .",
    "however , the rf - dc @xmath8 curves always show incomplete ml with the same broadening @xmath238 as discussed above .",
    "this broadening is too large to be explained by the elastic theory in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is either caused by residual slip in the @xmath21-row regions or by remaining plastic regions with interconnecting rows , but further experimental and numerical work is required to decide on this issue .    finally , we shortly return to the frequency dependence of the ml current width @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . extending the relation @xmath244 to frequencies below @xmath1 and taking the ideal @xmath245 behavior eq.([empirical ] ) for @xmath83 , we find that the ordering frequency @xmath2 would mark the velocity where @xmath246 .",
    "such interpretation implies that the dynamic ordering in our disordered system is a smooth , second order dynamic phase transition .",
    "using mode - locking experiments , we have investigated the dynamics of vortex arrays confined in disordered mesoscopic channels .",
    "the ml effect allows to trace in detail structural transitions from @xmath247 confined moving vortex chains on changing field .",
    "a study of the amplitude and frequency dependence of the ml steps and comparison to simulations of an _",
    "elastic _ chain provide a complete characterization of the pinning strength , dynamic ordering velocity and coherency of the arrays .",
    "we find that the spatial extent @xmath5 of coherently moving @xmath21 row regions is large at a matching field and shrinks with increasing mismatch . at the same time both the pinning frequency @xmath248 and the ordering frequency @xmath2 ( proportional to the ordering velocity ) increase with mismatch .",
    "we show that @xmath6 . together with our previous observation of a divergence of @xmath2 near the melting temperature in @xcite ,",
    "these results provide detailed experimental evidence for the phenomenological ordering theory of koshelev and vinokur @xcite .",
