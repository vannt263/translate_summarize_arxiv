    "in recent years , one of the inhomogeneous superconducting states , known as fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state , has received a lot of interest . this superconducting state with periodical spacial variation of order parameter ( op )",
    "was first proposed independently by fulde and ferrell  @xcite and by larkin and ovchinnikov  @xcite in 1960s .",
    "the possible evidence of its existence has been reported in certain unconventional superconductors  @xcite and the possibility of its realization in trapped cold atoms .",
    "@xcite in literature , the state is collectively known as the fflo state .",
    "@xcite actually , they are two kinds of states with slight difference : the order parameter of the lo state is real and spatially inhomogeneous , which breaks the translational symmetry , while the order parameter of the ff state has a uniform magnitude , but an inhomogeneous phase similar to that of a plane wave , breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "according to previous studies , the ff state is usually unstable , and unfavorable in comparison with the lo state .",
    "although the lo to ff phase transition was predicted in ref .  , a more recent study  @xcite shows that there is no stable ff phase in such a system and there is no lo to ff phase transition either .",
    "the authors in ref . , mention a possible ff state in a momentum space study , but as to the best of our knowledge , a realization of stable ff state in the presence of a zeeman field has not been reported yet in a real space calculation .",
    "as is well known when a zeeman field is added to a superconductor , the lo state becomes favorable in comparison with the bcs state , irrespective of the geometry of the superconductor .",
    "meanwhile , we notice that in a superconducting ring , which is threaded by a magnetic flux , the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) flux breaks the time reversal symmetry in much the same spirit as that in the ff phase .",
    "@xcite as a result the ff state comes out .",
    "an interesting question is then if we add both the magnetic flux and an in - plane magnetic field , how will the two phases compete with each other ? motivated by this observation , we study in this paper the interplay between this ab flux - driven ff phase and the zeeman field - induced lo phase .",
    "it is of great interest to study the phase transitions and phase diagram in such a system .",
    "the investigation is carried out in a tight - binding model for a superconducting ring pierced by an ab magnetic flux , and in the presence of a zeeman magnetic field .",
    "we solve self - consistently the bogliubov de gennes equation for the superconducting order parameter and determine the phase diagram by comparing the total energy .",
    "we find that for this system , there are four different phases when we vary the two parameters , magnetic flux @xmath0 and the zeeman field @xmath1 .",
    "more interestingly , we also study the mescscopic effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we introduce the tight - binding model and present the mean - field treatment . in sec .  [",
    "sec : result ] , we numerically carry out the calculation of superconducting order parameter as a function of the magnetic flux and zeeman field , and determine the phase diagram by comparing the free energies .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] is the discussion and conclusion .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath2 is applied in the plane of the ring .",
    "the ring is connected to the ground to ensure that the chemical potential is fix , but the electron number may fluctuate , width=6 ]    we consider a one - dimensional superconducting ring threaded by an external magnetic flux @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , there is an in - plane magnetic field @xmath2 , which generates the zeeman spliting and gives rise to the inhomogeneous pairing .",
    "the system is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath3 here @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bare hopping coefficient and @xmath6 is the normal - state flux quantum , and @xmath7 is number of lattice sites for the ring ; @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator on the @xmath10-th lattice site with spin @xmath11 for spin up and down electrons , arising from the interaction between the magnetic field and the spin of the electrons ; @xmath12 is the particle number on the @xmath10-th site with spin @xmath13 ; @xmath14 is equal to 2 ; @xmath15 is the bohr magneton and @xmath2 is the strength of the in - plane magnetic field ; @xmath16 is the strength of the on - site pairing interaction ; @xmath17 is the chemical potential . for simplicity , we define @xmath18 as the strength of the zeeman field . in the present work ,",
    "we take @xmath5 to be @xmath19 between nearest neighboring sites and zero otherwise . within the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the pair potential . to diagonalize this hamiltonian",
    ", we employ the following bogoliubov transformation @xmath22 \\\\",
    "c_{i \\sigma}^{\\dagger}=&\\sum_{\\nu }   \\left [ ( u_{i \\sigma}^{\\nu } ) ^{\\ast } \\gamma_{\\nu } ^{\\dagger } - \\sigma v_{i \\sigma}^{\\nu } \\gamma_{\\nu }   \\right ] , \\label{3 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the quasi - particle operators .",
    "the coefficients ( @xmath26 ) satisfy the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation :  @xcite @xmath27 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } u_{j \\sigma}^{\\nu }   \\\\",
    "v_{j \\overline{\\sigma}}^{\\nu } \\\\",

    "the self consistent equation of the pair potential @xmath30 is solved by iteration . here",
    "@xmath31 is the temperature the boltzmann constant @xmath32 has been taken . ) .",
    "notice that the quasiparticle energy is measured with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "in our numerical calculation , we take the energy unit @xmath33 , and the chemical potential @xmath34 , the interaction strength @xmath35 , and the ring size @xmath36 . though the system size is far from the thermodynamic limit",
    ", it already gives the same phase boundary as that of infinite @xmath7 .",
    "the order parameter structure depends not only on the zeeman field @xmath1 , but also the magnetic flux @xmath0 .",
    "we note  @xcite that all physical quantities have already been a function of @xmath0 with a period of @xmath37 even in the normal state .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient for us to consider the magnetic flux in the range @xmath38 $ ] . in the absence of the magnetic flux",
    "@xmath39 , the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) order parameter @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and the lo state is stable for @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the system becomes normal ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath46 . in the presence of the magnetic flux ,",
    "the magnetic flux can induce a change in the structure of the bcs state in an @xmath47-wave superconductor , namely a crossover from the bcs state in the absence of a magnetic flux to a ff state with a magnetic flux when the zeeman field is low @xmath48 .",
    "when the zeeman field increases , the lo becomes favorable and both bcs and ff states give in . if we continue to increase the zeeman field , the amplitude of the pairing potential of the lo phase will be suppressed by the zeeman field until it disappears finally , and the system enters the normal state . in the following",
    ", we will numerically construct the phase diagrams .",
    "we first focus on the low temperature case @xmath50 ( corresponding to @xmath51 ) . in the absence of the magnetic flux , there are three different phases : bcs , lo , and normal . in the presence of the magnetic flux , there are also three phases , ff , lo , and normal state . in the following , we study the phase transitions and the phase boundaries for fixed temperature when varying @xmath1 and @xmath0 .    in order to check",
    "if the ff state becomes the ground state , we assign a periodic phase to the order parameter at each site as an initial condition .",
    "similarly , we assign a constant phase to see if bcs state becomes the ground state . for a set of fixed parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath31 ) , different stable solutions ( with different order parameter textures ) could be obtained from different initial configurations .",
    "for example , one may find both stable lo - type op and ff - type op for the same set of parameters ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "even there are more than one stable lo type solutions for the same set of parameters , which means different net momentum of the cooper pair .",
    "to distinguish one state from other competing states ( including bcs state and ff state ) , we choose the energetically most favored one by comparing their free energies . for the model ( [ 1 ] ) , the free energy is given by @xmath53 here , we just compare the summation of the first two terms , because the third term is a constant for all solutions of different phases . in the following",
    "we determine the phase boundary between ff state , lo state , and normal state .",
    "when determining the pair potential self - consistently by iteration , we find that in certain range of the strength of the in - plane zeeman field @xmath1 , different initial configurations of the pair potential lead to different stable solutions . in another word , there are more than one stable solutions through iteration . for example , when we fix @xmath54 , and vary the magnetic field in the range @xmath55 , stable solutions of both the ff type and the lo type can be arrived at through iteration .",
    "the free energies of these two types of stable solutions are listed in table i. it can be seen that the lo state becomes energetically favorable when the magnetic field is equal to or greater than @xmath56 .",
    "in addition , the free energy at @xmath57 is continuous , but its first order derivative is not continuous .",
    "hence , we conclude that for a fixed magnetic flux @xmath54 , there is a first - order phase transition between the ff and lo states at @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , we fix magnetic flux @xmath0 at different values and we can find the threshold value of @xmath1 at which the system changes from the ff state to the lo state or vise versa .",
    "thus for a fixed temperature @xmath58 and fixed system size @xmath36 , the phase transition line between ff and lo state is determined by comparing the free energy of the ff phase and the lo phase , and we plot it in fig .",
    "to ensure that the phase boundary given by @xmath36 is close to that of the thermodynamic limit , we change the system size to @xmath59 , and we find the phase boundary does not change . for @xmath36 and @xmath59 ,",
    "the magnitude of the op @xmath60 in bcs phase is the same .",
    "hence the result based on @xmath36 can be regarded as in thermodynamic limit .",
    "it can be seen that the first - order transition line is not parallel to the @xmath0 axis , so we can turn the flux to make the system change from the lo phase to the ff phase or vise versa .",
    "we call this phase transition ab effect induced phase transition .",
    "we can also see that the phase boundary between the lo and ff states is symmetric around @xmath54 , and the period of ff phase is @xmath61 .",
    ".free energies ( up to a constant @xmath62 ) for stable solutions of ff state and lo state .",
    "here the ring size is @xmath36 , the magnetic flux @xmath63 , and the temperature @xmath58 .",
    "it can be seen that there is a first - order phase transition from the ff state to lo state when the in - plane magnetic field is tune across @xmath64 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -@xmath0 plane .",
    "here the ring size is @xmath36 , and the temperature is @xmath65 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "notice that the boundary line between the ff and lo phases has the periodicity in @xmath0 with a period of @xmath66 while that between the lo and normal state phases has the periodicity in @xmath0 with a period of @xmath37 .",
    "specifically , the lo state exists in the range @xmath67 $ ] , @xmath68 $ ] , and @xmath69 $ ] for @xmath39 , @xmath70 , and @xmath66 , respectively.,width=302 ]      if we continue to increase the in - plane magnetic field above the value @xmath71 for @xmath0 fixed at @xmath70 , all initial configurations of the pair potential will lead to the lo state , or only the lo state becomes stable .",
    "meanwhile the amplitude of the pair potential decreases and the period of the modulation of the pair potential is shortened continuously .",
    "further increase of the zeeman field leads to the reduction of the pair potential until it vanishes gradually .",
    "when the magnetic field reaches @xmath72 , the amplitude of the pairing potential vanishes , or the lo state is completely depressed by the in - plane magnetic field , and the system changes from the lo state to the normal state . if we do the iteration from zero pair potential , we will find that when @xmath73 the stable solution for the pair potential is zero ( normal state ) .",
    "when @xmath74 , the stable solution is an lo state .",
    "there is no coexistence area of the lo and the normal states in the @xmath1 axis .",
    "hence we conclude that the phase transition at @xmath75 for a fixed @xmath0 is a second - order phase transitoin .",
    "our result is consistent with previous studies .",

    "the zero - field transition temperature is around @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath39 and @xmath70 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in the preceding subsection , we study the phase transitions when we vary the magnetic flux @xmath0 or the in - plane magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the temperature is fixed at a very low value .",
    "hence these phase transitions can be regarded as quantum phase transitions . in this subsection",
    ", we will study the phase transitions induced by thermal fluctuations , and determine their phase boundaries .",
    "we will fix the magnetic flux @xmath0 and vary the temperature @xmath84 or the in - plane magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "first we consider the case in the absence of the magnetic flux @xmath39 .",
    "we fix the temperature at @xmath84=20 ( @xmath31=0.05 ) , @xmath84=10 ( @xmath31=0.10 ) , @xmath84=6.67 ( @xmath31=0.15 ) , @xmath84=5 ( @xmath31=0.20 ) , and @xmath84=4 ( @xmath31=0.25 ) respectively , and do the iteration separately . the phase boundary between the bcs and lo states is determined in a similar way to that in sec .",
    "[ sec : result].a .",
    "it can be seen that when we fix the magnetic flux to be zero , and tune the in - plane magnetic field or the temperature , the system will change between the bcs , lo , and normal states . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "the lo phase emerges below the critical temperature @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the bcs to the lo state is first order , and the lo to normal is second order .",
    "when the magnetic flux is nonzero , the bcs state will be replaced by ff state with the phase diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , very similar to the zero - flux case .      -@xmath0 plane .",
    "all the parameters are the same as that in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] except that the ring size is @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath87 ( b ) .",
    "the empty area represents the normal state .",
    "the gray area represents the ff state , and the area covered by the thin black lines represents the lo state .",
    "the thick black lines represent the bcs state .",
    "it can be seen that with the decrease of the ring size , the ff phase expand a lot and the lo phase shrink dramatically .",
    "the period of ff phase also changes from @xmath61 to @xmath88,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] -@xmath0 plane .",
    "all the parameters are the same as that in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] except that the ring size is @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath87 ( b ) .",
    "the empty area represents the normal state .",
    "the gray area represents the ff state , and the area covered by the thin black lines represents the lo state .",
    "the thick black lines represent the bcs state .",
    "it can be seen that with the decrease of the ring size , the ff phase expand a lot and the lo phase shrink dramatically .",
    "the period of ff phase also changes from @xmath61 to @xmath88,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    another interesting question is the mesoscopic effect . in this subsection",
    "we will study the mesoscopic effect by fixing the temperature and decreasing the ring size . as mentioned in the above discussion",
    ", the ring size @xmath36 already gives the same phase boundary as that of @xmath89 .",
    "a simple check is that when we increase the ring size to @xmath90 , and @xmath59 , we find that the phase boundaries do not change in comparison with that for @xmath36 .",
    "this means that for the current model , @xmath36 can be treated as in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , if we decrease the ring size , for example to @xmath86 , the mesoscopic effect will occur .",
    "first , in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane , the lo phase will shrink dramatically and the ff phase will expand ( see fig .  [ fig4](a ) ) .",
    "this is because ( 1 ) the influence of the magnetic flux on the system will increase and the influence of the in - plane zeeman field will decrease relatively , and ( 2 ) having a finite size restricts the periodicity of the lo order parameter . at a given zeeman field , if the period is not commensurate with the corresponding ring , solutions of the lo state will have to be modified to be commensurate with system size , which results in some energy cost .",
    "therefore , the lo state will shrink .",
    "second , the periodicity of the magnetic flux changes from @xmath61 to @xmath88 .",
    "this is because the system size is so small that the cooper pair can no longer be treated as a whole , and can only be treated as two separate electrons .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) the phase boundary for @xmath87 and the re - entrant behavior of various phases can be seen in the phase diagram .",
    "based upon a tight - binding model , we study a one - dimensional @xmath47-wave superconducting ring subject to an in - plane zeeman field and a magnetic flux by solving the bdg equation in real space . in the presence of a magnetic flux , a crossover from the bcs state to the ff state is obtained when the in - plane magnetic field is not very strong . if we increase the strength of the in - plane magnetic field , the lo state becomes favorable , and a ff to lo phase transition occurs . with the further increase of the in - plane magnetic field strength , the magnitude of the pair potential of the lo state is suppressed , and disappears finally with the system entering the normal state . in the absence of the magnetic flux , there is no ff phase , and the zeeman field induces the transitions between the bcs , lo , and normal states , which has been studied extensively .",
    "@xcite our results agree well with the previous studies in a two - dimensional system that the energetically favorable state for @xmath47-wave superconductor is a one - dimensional stripe - like lo state .",
    "this suggests the first - order transition between the bcs and lo states while a second - order transition between the lo to normal states .",
    "our study goes beyond that and indicates a stable ff state due to the magnetic flux .",
    "the mesoscopic effects are also studied .",
    "when the system size decreases , two mesoscopic effects arise : ( 1 ) the lo phase in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane shrinks , and the ff state expands due to the enhancement of the aharanov - bohm effect ; ( 2 ) the periodicity of the external magnetic flux will change from @xmath66 to @xmath37 .",
    "the following remarks are in order : ( 1 ) though we study a one - dimensional model , the system should not be regarded as a mathematically one - dimensional .",
    "the current study can be easily extended to the two - dimensional and other geometry , such as a torus configuration threaded by a magnetic flux .",
    "it can be expected that a similar phase transition between lo state and ff state will occur .",
    "( 2 ) for the one - dimensional case , the lo state exists in a broader range of parameters space ( @xmath91 space , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) than that of two - dimensional and three - dimensional cases ,  @xcite which makes it easier to access experimentally .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .",
    ", it is reported that an trap potential with arbitrary configuration can be achieved .",
    "hence , we expect that the result presented in this paper should be able to be observed experimentally in cold fermions under current experiment technique .",
    "( 4 ) in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath89 , the ff state reproduces the bcs state , because the phase gradient of the order parameter is vanishingly small .",
    "this result agrees with our intuition that when the ring size becomes infinity , the influence of the magnetic flux can be neglected .",
    "( 5 ) the effect of the impurity is not included in the current study , and will be given in our future studies .",
