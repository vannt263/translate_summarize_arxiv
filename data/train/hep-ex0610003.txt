    "a considerable @xmath0 production rate has been recently measured in @xmath3 collisions at the energy of the @xmath2(5s ) resonance @xcite .",

    "although several @xmath0 decay channels have been recently observed by the tevatron experiments @xcite , a number of @xmath0 decay modes can be better measured at @xmath3 colliders running at the @xmath2(5s ) energy .",
    "the detectors taking data at the @xmath2(5s ) have many advantages in studies of @xmath0 decays , such as high photon and @xmath21 reconstruction efficiency , trigger efficiency of almost 100@xmath22 for hadronic modes and excellent charged kaon and pion identification .",
    "the possibility of partial reconstruction of specific @xmath0 decays and a model - independent determination of the number of initial @xmath0 mesons , which opens the possibility of precise absolute @xmath0 branching fraction measurements , are additional advantages of @xmath0 studies at @xmath3 colliders running at the @xmath2(5s ) .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of exclusive @xmath0 decays based on an @xmath2(5s ) data sample of 1.86fb@xmath1 , collected with the belle detector @xcite at the kekb asymmetric energy @xmath3 collider @xcite .",
    "this data sample is more than four times larger than the 0.42  fb@xmath1 dataset collected at the @xmath2(5s ) by the cleo experiment in 2003 @xcite , where first evidence of exclusive @xmath0 decays at the @xmath2(5s ) was found .",
    "we fully reconstruct six modes @xmath4 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which have large reconstruction efficiencies and are mediated by unsuppressed @xmath26 tree diagrams .",
    "charge - conjugate modes are implicitly included everywhere in this paper . to improve the statistical significance of the @xmath0 signal",
    ", these six modes are combined ; the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath11 mesons are determined from a common signal fit .",
    "in addition , we search for several rare @xmath0 decays : the penguin annihilation decay @xmath15 , the electromagnetic @xmath27 penguin decay @xmath16 , and the hadronic @xmath27 penguin decay @xmath17 .",
    "although the branching fractions for these decays are expected to be too small to be observed with this dataset , we can obtain useful upper limits .",
    "to date , only upper limits for the decays @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite have been published . within the standard model",
    "the @xmath15 decay is expected to proceed via a penguin annihilation diagram and to have a branching fraction in the range @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , this decay is sensitive to some beyond - the - standard model ( bsm ) contributions and can be enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude in some bsm models @xcite .",

    "these decay branching fractions are of special interest @xcite .",
    "these modes are expected to be predominantly @xmath37 eigenstates and , because their branching fractions are expected to be large , they should lead to a sizable lifetime difference between the @xmath37-odd and @xmath37-even @xmath0 mesons .",
    "therefore within the sm framework the relative decay - width difference @xmath38 can be obtained from measurement of the @xmath18 branching fractions .",
