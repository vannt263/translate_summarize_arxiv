    "such old low - mass stars should typically have very low metallicites because they were formed from a gas that had not been significantly enriched with heavy elements .",
    "they carry invaluable information on the early chemical evolution of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered a low - mass and extremely metal - deficient star in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "the star has extremely small abundances of carbon and nitrogen .",
    "the upper limit of corresponding metallicity of the star is estimated to be @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the abundances of carbon and oxygen derived from the spectra of the star suggests that the parent cloud from which the star was born had been chemically enriched by core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "it is generally thought that metal - free primordial stars are predominantly massive ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although not extremely massive @xcite .",
    "this is largely because metal - free gas lacks efficient coolants other than hydrogen molecules ; a primordial gas cloud is thermally stable throughout its pre - stellar collapse @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that a trace amount of heavy elements provide efficient cooling in low - metallicity gas , which may then enable the formation of low - mass stars ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "there is another argument that the existence of dust grains in low - metallicity gas is crucial for the low - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "although it is still unclear whether or not gas metallicity is the key quantity to determine the characteristic stellar mass , and whether or not there is `` critical metallicity '' for low - mass star formation , there must be a mechanism for the formation of low - mass stars in extremely low - metallicity gas ] .",

    "the sn shell becomes gravitationally unstable for a certain range of parameters such as explosion energy , ambient gas density , and metallicity .",

    "they show that the jeans mass of the fragment is below the solar mass when the fragment becomes optically thick . however , it remains uncertain whether the gas cloud further fragment or not .    in this paper , we study sn - triggered star formation , using hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we first run one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to follow the thermal evolution of an early sn remnant .",

    "while the gas cloud continues collapsing gravitationally , it cools rapidly by dust thermal emission and eventually fragments to sub - solar mass clumps .",

    "the cooling rate due to inverse compton scattering is also included .    in the lower temperature regime ( @xmath20 ) , we solve the non - equilibrium chemical reactions and radiative processes of the following fifteen species : @xmath21 , h , h@xmath22 , h@xmath23 , d , d@xmath22 , d@xmath23 , he , he@xmath22 , he@xmath23 , h@xmath24 , h@xmath25 , hd , hd@xmath22 , and heh@xmath22 .",

    "we also calculate the fine - structure transition line cooling of heavy elements including c , o , si , and fe .",
    "these species are assumed to be in the form of , , , and , respectively .",
    "the fraction of each species in the gas is derived by multiplying the solar abundance by metallicity ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "we perform one - zone calculations to follow the thermal and chemical evolution of one of such collapsing gas clouds .",
    "we assume that the collapse occurs approximately in a spherically symmetric manner .",

    "the evolution of the sn shell structure is described as follows . in the initial sedov - taylor phase ,",
    "the sn remnant expands adiabatically as long as the radiative cooling time , @xmath77 , is longer than the shell expansion time scale , @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "then , radiative cooling becomes effective and the gas just behind the shock starts to lose its thermal energy . at @xmath79 yr after the sn explosion , the cold shell is pushed by the large pressure of the inner hot gas , forming a very dense shell ( the pressure - driven snowplough phase ) . during the pressure - driven phase ,",
    "the fluid element plotted in figure [ fig : nt1d_l ] enters the shock front , increasing its density and temperature rapidly .",
    "the inner hot region still impacts the cold shell , generating multiple weak shocks behind the shell .",
    "we see this as oscillatory features from epoch ( 3 ) to epoch ( 4 ) in figure [ fig : nt1d_l ] . finally , at epoch ( 4 ) , the shell is decelerated sufficiently to be gravitationally unstable as we shall discuss in  [ subsec : criterion ] .      figure [ fig : prof_s ] shows the structures of the shell for @xmath80 at the time ( 1 ) @xmath81 , ( 2 ) @xmath82 , ( 3 ) @xmath83 , and ( 4 ) @xmath84 yr .",
    "figure [ fig : nt1d_s ] illustrates the evolution of the gas density and temperature for a fluid element initially located at 34.3 pc from the center . in this model ,",
    "the shell is in the sedov - taylor phase around epoch ( 1 ) and then enters the pressure - driven snowplough phase at @xmath85 yr . in this case with low ambient gas density , the transition from the sedov - taylor phase to the pressure - driven phase occurs later than the model with high ambient gas density .",
    "when the shell sweeps up denser ambient medium , radiative cooling of the shell , which is generally proportional to the square of gas density , becomes larger , and the enhanced radiative cooling makes the shell evolve faster . the shell continues to expand even after the pressure inside the shell declines due to radiative cooling , conserving the momentum ( the momentum - conserving snowplough phase ) . in our calculation , the shell enters the momentum - conserving phase by epoch ( 3 ) .",
    "the shell thickness increases because of the pressure in the shell .",
    "the internal energy of the shell remains higher by less effective radiative cooling . around epoch",
    "( 4 ) , the ellapsed time reaches the dynamical timescale for the dark matter halo hosting the progenitor star ( @xmath86 yr for @xmath87 halo at @xmath88 ) .",
    "there are several criteria proposed for the instability of an expanding and decelerating gas shell .",
    "@xcite derive approximate conditions for the collapse of an expanding and decelerating shell by linear analysis of density perturbations under the thin - shell approximation .",
    "then , @xcite and @xcite include the effect of the internal structure of the shell to the result by @xcite . for a shell with average column density over the all solid angle , @xmath89 , shell radius , @xmath90 , and velocity @xmath91 ,",

    "in equation ( [ eq : o_peak ] ) , the first and second terms in the right hand side represent the effect of the shell expansion and the last term represents the effect of the shell internal pressure and self - gravity .",
    "if the peak growth rate , @xmath103 , is positive , perturbations with the corresponding wavenumber have a growing solution , which means the sn - driven shell becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments with scales corresponding to @xmath93 start to grow in the shell .",
    "it is obvious that fast expansion ( large @xmath91 ) tends to smooth out perturbations .",
    "for the gas to become gravitationally unstable , its expansion velocity must be sufficiently small such that @xmath104      in this section , we discuss whether the gravitational instability can be triggered or not .",
    "we apply the criterion by @xcite to our calculations because the internal structure of a shell is taken into account in their analysis . in order to investigate the stability of the shell ,",
    "we calculate the time evolution of the peak growth rate , @xmath103 [ equation ( [ eq : o_peak ] ) ] by using the radius of the shock front , the shock velocity , volume - weighted mean density , mass - weighted mean temperature , and mean molecular weight in the shell . in the snowplough phase ,",
    "the shell is defined by the outer boundary ( shock front ) and the inner boundary .",
    "the outer boundary is determined as position where the density is 1.1 @xmath105 .",

    "if the time for fragmentation is comparable to or larger than the dynamical timescale of the hosting halo , @xmath106 , we do not count such cases as successful fragmentation of the sn shell in the cosmological context .",
    "after the dynamical timescale , it is likely that the halo itself collapses or is incorporated into a large halo , thereby the structure of the entire system would be much different .",
    "applying the fragmentation condition , we find that for the sn model of @xmath107 , the compressed and decelerated shell becomes gravitationally unstable at @xmath108 yr .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath109 , the peak growth rate @xmath103 becomes positive at @xmath110 yr when the shell is about to fall back ( @xmath111 ) by the gravitational potential of the host halo . in this model , since the time @xmath112 is comparable to the dynamical timescale , it is uncertain whether the shell fragments or collapses into the center of the halo .",

    "the results are shown only for @xmath114 because they are almost exactly the same as the results of the @xmath115 models .",
    "it is because the fine - structure cooling of metals such as c and o has little effect on the evolution of the sn remnant in such an extremely metal - poor regime until the shell becomes gravitationally unstable .",
    "also , the time @xmath113 is insensitive to the sn explosion energy . for a radiative remnant , the shock radius increases only as @xmath116 in the pressure - driven phase @xcite .",
    "the time @xmath113 depends on the ambient gas density . as the ambient gas density is larger , denser and colder shell is formed as we discuss in  [ subsubsec : s ] and the growth rate of the perturbations on the shell , @xmath117 becomes positive earlier .",
    "the jeans mass ( typical mass ) of the fragment is shown in the last column of table [ tab : frag ] .",
    "the mass decreases as ambient gas density increases because the density of the shell swept up by the blast wave becomes larger .",

    "<S> we propose a model that early supernova ( sn ) explosions trigger the formation of low - mass stars via shell fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> we first perform one - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of an early sn remnant . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the shocked shell undergoes efficient radiative cooling and then becomes gravitationally unstable to fragment and collapse in about a million years . </S>",
    "<S> we then follow the thermal evolution of the collapsing fragments using a one - zone code . </S>",
    "<S> our one - zone calculation treats chemistry and radiative cooling self - consistently in low - metallicity gas . </S>",
    "<S> the collapsing gas cloud evolves roughly isothermally , until it cools rapidly by dust continuum emission at the density @xmath2@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the cloud core then becomes unstable and fragments again . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that early sne can trigger the formation of low - mass stars in the extremely metal - poor environment as @xcite discovered recently . </S>"
