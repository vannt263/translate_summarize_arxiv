    "the study of quantum groups and quantum algebras has attracted a great interest in recent years and stimulated intense research in several areas of physics @xcite , taking into account a wide spectrum of applications , since cosmic strings and black holes to the fractional quantum hall effect and high - tc superconductors @xcite and theories of rational field , non - commutative geometry , the quantum theory of super - algebras and so on @xcite .",
    "there is no satisfactory universally recognized definition of a quantum group .",
    "the concept of quantum groups was motivated by problems from a large number of physical situations .",
    "the so - called @xmath0-deformed algebra @xcite has been the object of interest in literature both in physics and mathematics over the past years .",
    "a great effort has been devoted to their understanding and development @xcite .",
    "one of its main ingredients is a measure of deformation @xmath0 , introduced in the commutation relations that define the lie algebra of the system with the condition that the original lie algebra , not deformed , is produced at the limit @xmath3 . from the seminal work of biedenharn @xcite and macfarlane @xcite ,",
    "it is clear that the q - calculation initially introduced at the beginning of the last century by jackson @xcite based on the study of the hypergeometric function @xcite , plays a central role in the quantum group representations with a deep physical significance .",
    "indeed , it was shown that the @xmath0-deformed oscillators using the jackson derivative ( jd ) or the so - called @xmath0-derivative operators @xcite define a generalized @xmath0-deformed dynamic of the @xmath0-commutative phase space .",
    "thus , it appeared recently a great interest in investigating the @xmath0-deformed thermodynamical systems @xcite .",
    "one possible mechanism capable of generating a deformed version of classical statistical mechanics is to replace the gibbs - boltzmann distribution , by postulating a deformed entropy involving a generalized thermodynamic theory .",
    "thus , some generalizations of statistical mechanics were proposed @xcite . it has also been demonstrated in @xcite that a natural realization of thermodynamics of @xmath0-deformed bosons and fermions can be found in the formalism of @xmath0-calculus .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the q - integration is related to the free energy of spin systems @xcite  see also @xcite .    in a more specific case ,",
    "we focus our attention to studying of the landau diamagnetism problem .",
    "the landau diamagnetism problem continues to raise issues that have strong relevance today .",
    "these issues are related to the inherent quantum nature of the problem .",
    "it can be used as a phenomenon to illustrate the essential role of quantum mechanics in the surface and perimeter corrections , the dissipation of statistical mechanics of non - equilibrium , and others .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we present the q - deformed algebra and jackson derivative . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we develop the q - deformed landau diamagnetism . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we make our final comments .",
    "the @xmath0-deformed algebraic symmetry of the quantum oscillator is defined by the @xmath0-deformed heisenberg algebra in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 as @xcite @xmath6_k = [ c^{\\dagger},c^{\\dagger}]_k = 0\\quad,\\qquad\\qquad\\ cc^{\\dagger } -kqc^{\\dagger}c = q^{-n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath7 = -c , \\ ] ] where the deformation parameter @xmath0 is real , being the constant @xmath8 for @xmath0-bosons ( with commutators ) and @xmath9 for @xmath0-fermions ( with anticommutators ) .",

    "therefore , jd naturally occurs in quantum deformed structures .",
    "it turns out to be a crucial role in @xmath0-generalization of thermodynamical relations @xcite .",
    "to explain the phenomenon of diamagnetism , we have to take into account the interaction between the external magnetic field and the orbital motion of electrons . disregarding the spin , the hamiltonian of a particle of mass @xmath29 and charge @xmath30 in the presence of a magnetic field * h * ,",
    "is given by the expression @xmath31 where * a * is the vector potential associated with the magnetic field @xmath32 and c is the speed of light .",
    "let us start to formalize the statistical mechanical problem by using the grand partition function in the form @xmath33\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 . recall that @xmath35 for bosons and fermions , respectively . here , we have generalized the landau diamagnetism problem , usually embedded in three dimensions , to embed it in @xmath36dimensions , i.e. , we have now @xmath37 transversal dimensions .",
    "below , we further generalize this result by also applying the jackson derivative .",
    "however , our study is focused on the analysis of diamagnetism in the limit of high temperatures @xmath38 where we apply the @xmath0-deformed algebra .",
    "thus , the partition function is written as follows @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fugacity , @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 is the thermal wavelength . for the sake of simplicity , in our calculations we simply use @xmath43 , where @xmath44 . with these substitutions we can rewrite the equation ( [ eq ] ) as @xmath45",
    "now we are ready to applying the @xmath0-deformed algebra via the introduction of jd , which is a key factor of @xmath0-deformed thermodynamics .",
    "this is achieved through the modification of the ordinary thermodynamical derivatives as follows @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the jd s .",
    "the @xmath0-deformed algebra earlier discussed leads to @xmath0-deformed statistical mechanics of the quantum oscillator whose deformation is encoded in the occupation number @xmath49 , say for bosons @xcite @xmath50 with the @xmath0-deformed number now defined as @xmath51    because we are working with @xmath52 in our previous partition function we also apply this limit to @xmath49 to find the leading term @xmath53 such that @xmath54 the same reasoning applies to the internal energy so that we can use eqs .",
    "( [ eqi ] ) and ( [ eqii ] ) to establish the following relations @xmath55    we shall now apply these results to our specific example . as one knows the internal energy",
    "is defined in the form @xmath56 thus , to implement the jd is necessary first to change the basis as follows @xmath57 such that @xmath58 @xmath59 so using the jd definition in eq .",
    "( [ jd0 ] ) and its approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ jd ] ) we find @xmath60 now performing the summation we find the following @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "therefore the internal energy is written as @xmath63 to calculate the number of particles we have @xmath64 now applying into eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the jd , using the jd definition in eq .",
    "( [ jd0 ] ) and its approximation given in eq .",
    "( [ jd ] ) , just as we did for the internal energy case , we get @xmath65      to determine the specific heat , we first make use of the jacobian @xmath66 @xmath67 using the derivatives above , we find @xmath68 applying the equation ( [ eq4 ] ) in the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) and substituting @xmath5 obtained in the equation ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , we arrive at the specific heat @xmath69 recall that @xmath70 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this coincides with the usual result .      for determining the magnetization we carried out the thermodynamical derivative @xmath71 where the grand potential @xmath72 is determined as @xmath73 however , to implement the jd we have to make the change as follows @xmath74 thus we find @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 we can also eliminate the chemical potential through the number of particles @xmath5 and rewrite the magnetization as @xmath79 or in terms of the langevin function given by @xmath80 we get to @xmath81 which is formally the same as the usual magnetization , with @xmath5 playing the role of @xmath0-deformed number of particles .",
    "let us now make the analysis in the weak field limit @xmath82 as follows .",
    "the use of this limit into the equation ( [ eq5 ] ) give us @xmath83 now computing the susceptibility reads @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath86 one can find a relation between @xmath0 and the number of extra dimensions @xmath87 as follows .",
    "consider @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "if the size of the extra dimensions is not necessarily the same as the size of the three spatial dimensions of the visible universe , e.g. , @xmath90 such that @xmath91 , then we can write @xmath92 as @xmath93 where @xmath94 measures the new ` strength ' of the susceptibility . for a fixed value found @xmath95 one allows us to write the relations",
    "@xmath96 it is expected that for @xmath97 one may find @xmath98 ( when @xmath2 ) and for @xmath99 one has @xmath100 which may change with the size @xmath101 of a sample of a material in a way that goes like @xmath102 .",
    "notice that @xmath103 can play the role of a scale that brings the size of extra dimensions higher even if @xmath95 approaches unit .    in summary , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq - chi ] ) and ( [ eq - n0 ] ) we see that for @xmath104 ( the usual case ) the susceptibility varies with the material size according to the power law @xmath105 , such that deviations to a power law @xmath102 may reveal a signature of extra dimensions .",
    "one may find in the literature experimental results for susceptibility changing with the size of a material sample , see for instance @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figur2 ] is depicted the behavior of the @xmath0-deformed magnetization for @xmath104 and some values for @xmath0 .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ figur3 ] shows the behavior of @xmath106 as a function of the number of @xmath1-dimensions for @xmath2 .",
    "we apply the @xmath0-deformed quantum algebra in the landau diamagnetism problem embedded in @xmath1-dimensions , in the limit of high temperatures .",
    "we obtain @xmath0-deformed values @xmath107 for internal energy , number of particles , magnetization , susceptibility and specific heat .",
    "we see that the q - deformed thermodynamical quantities change , except the specific ones , i.e. , those quantities per particles , such as specific heat .",
    "that means that all effect of the q - deformation is completely stored into the number of particles @xmath5 .",
    "it seems to be related to _",
    "impurities _ in a sample of a diamagnetic material .",
    "as expected , in the limit @xmath28 we see that the results are identical to those in the literature @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamical quantities also depend on the number of @xmath1-dimensions since it is present in the constant @xmath86  see fig .",
    "[ figur3 ] .",
    "note that for @xmath108 this constant decreases as the number of dimensions @xmath1 increases . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath106 increases with @xmath1 as @xmath109 , and has no changes as @xmath110 . an interesting phenomenon , for instance ,",
    "can be achieved in the second case ( the bulk sample is larger than the thermal wavelength @xmath111 ) , where the the magnetization is minimized for @xmath104 ( we are assuming all times @xmath112 ) . on the other hand , in the first case ( the bulk sample is smaller than the thermal wavelength @xmath111 ) the magnetization is minimized just for a large number of dimensions .",
    "this suggests a mechanism that can be used to select the maximal number of dimensions of the spacetime with minimal diamagnetism , as in our universe .",
    "this fact may find some applications in extra - dimensional physics such as modern cosmology , particle physics and string theory .",
