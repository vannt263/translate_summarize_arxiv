    "the field of hetterostructures , has seen tremendous interest in recent times both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",
    "heterostructures fabricated out of strongly correlated systems , in particular have shown very novel properties .",
    "these emergent properties are sometimes very different from the properties of the individual constituent materials . for example",
    "the heterostructure of a mott insulator and a band insulator has been shown to have metallic behaviour@xcite .",
    "this is due to aggregation of delocalized electrons at the interface of such a heterostructure .",
    "on lowering the temperature , the system can even become superconducting@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a metal - disordered mott insulator heterostructure .",
    "the corresponding clean case system has recently received lot of theoretical attention and has been variously claimed to be a fragile fermi liquid@xcite which shows metallic character at any finite correlation strength , and a `` de facto impenetrable mott insulator '' @xcite , with highly decaying spectral weight at the fermi energy . in a recent work we@xcite have shown that the clean system is insulating for all finite values of correlation that we could work with .",
    "the system was also found to have multiple gaps in the energy spectrum , as a result of charge reconstruction on varying correlations .",
    "an interesting relevant question in this context is the role of disorder on the whole phenomenon .",
    "experimentally heterostructures are fabricated with a certain degree of disorder present in them .",
    "the disorder can arise dueto non trivial local atomic and electronic structure due to the presence of dangling bonds and incomplete atomic coordination . with these fundamental issues in mind ,",
    "we have investigated a heterostructure comprising of a metal - disordered mott insulator - metal sandwich . very interestingly , we find that the introduction of disorder can generate a metal insulator transition in the region where the corresponding clean system was gapped .",
    "this is because disorder is able to nullify the effect of correlation in a certain range of values and also delocalize the wave functions .",
    "the route to metallicity has very close connection to the metallic phase that is stabilised by increasing disorder from a clean mott insulator , due to the closing of the mott gap as shown by aguiar et .",
    "al @xcite , using generalized dmft methods .    in the system we study here",
    ", there is charge reconstruction between the planes and consequent inhomogenity in the underlying charge landscape .",
    "this inhomogenity was found to be sufficient to render the system insulating even in the gapless state of the clean system .",
    "here we show that disorder is able to negate the effect of correlation over a small range of values and generates a metallic phase .",
    "we work with correlated disorder of the thue - morse and fibonacci type .",
    "correlated disorder has been studied extensively before@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the quasi - periodic systems have shown that in the non - interacting limit the wave function shows a power law localization both in one@xcite and two@xcite dimensions .",
    "a very recent experiment in a 1d quasi - periodic optical lattice@xcite , where the system was described by an aubry - andre hamiltonian , has shown exponentially localized states(anderson localization ) in the large disorder limit .",
    "a theoretical explanantion of the above result has been attempted using fibonacci sequence in 1d @xcite    correlated disorder introduces a certain type of disorder which does not depend on the realisation , but still breaks translational sysmmetry .",
    "its relevance in capturing the effect of interplay between correlation and disorder has been shown recently by us@xcite .",
    "the two chosen sequences have been wrapped over the quasi 2d system in the mott layers .",
    "we use unrestricted hartree fock to study the problem as it is able to capture the role of disorder exactly and the effect of spatial variation in the order parameters both in plane and perpendicular to them .",
    "the effect of correlation is captured in a fully self consistent manner .",
    "it works very well in higher dimensions at half filling and even in 2d @xcite and 1d @xcite gives results comparable to qmc and real space renormalization calculations .",
    "it can not however capture the effect of large effective mass renormalization and the evolution of the sharp metallic peak in the spectral function at the fermi energy .",
    "we now present and discuss our work .",
    "we take the barrier of our metal - barrier - metal sandwich to be described by the single - orbital disordered hubbard model , and the metallic planes by the tight - binding model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is    @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the site index.the operator @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron of spin @xmath4 at site @xmath5 .",
    "we set both the in - plane and the inter plane hopping to be nearest neighbor only , and equal to @xmath6 .",
    "the lattice structure is that of a simple cubic lattice .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the site potential at the ith site which follows either a thue - morse or a fibonacci sequence in the barrier planes and are zero in the metallic planes .",
    "a thue - morse sequence is generated by following the rule : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the two different sites . in our case site @xmath11 has a higher site potential than site @xmath10 ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , being the disorder strength ) .",
    "thue - morse chain in a particular generation looks like : @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 sites are found in equal numbers in any thue morse sequence of even entries .",
    "the generating scheme of fibonacci sequence is @xmath8 and @xmath15 .",
    "a typical fibonacci chain in a particular generation looks like : @xmath16 . here",
    "sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 follows a golden mean ratio .",
    "these two sequences correspond to two different impurity site concentration in the system . in thue",
    "morse 50% of the barrier sites are @xmath11 type , while in fibonacci the corresponding number is 38% . it is therefore expected that the effect of disorder would be more strong for the thue morse disorder compared to the fibonacci disorder .",
    "these sequences have been wrapped over the quasi 2d lattice in the barrier planes .",
    "the interaction term is written in a particle - hole symmetric fashion .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath17 is calculated by demanding that there be exactly n electrons in the problem and is calculated by taking the average of the n/2 th and the ( n/2 + 1 ) th energy level .",
    "we label the planes by @xmath18 with @xmath19 or @xmath20 corresponding to the metallic layers .",
    "all the other @xmath18 values in between correspond to the barrier planes . thus @xmath21",
    "= @xmath22 = 0 , while for all other @xmath18 , @xmath23 = @xmath24 .",
