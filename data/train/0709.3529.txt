    "theoretical and experimental investigations of motor proteins , or molecular motors , have recently become a subject of considerable attention because of importance of these molecules for fundamental understanding of non - equilibrium processes in chemistry and biology @xcite .",
    "motor proteins are active enzymatic molecules that consume a chemical energy and transform it into mechanical work , while moving at the same time along linear molecular tracks .",
    "they play a critical role in many biological processes @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional molecular motors powered by the hydrolysis of atp or related compounds , a recently discovered molecular motor called collagenase fuels its motion along collagen fibrils by using a significantly different mechanism that utilizes asymmetric collagen proteolysis @xcite . the biased diffusion of this motor protein along the molecular track results from the fact that the motor protein molecule after cutting the bond at the specific site of the collagen fiber is always found on one side of the reaction site , and it is unable to cross the broken link after the cleavage .",
    "analysis of collagenase transport suggests that a successful description of this motor protein s dynamics can be obtained by utilizing so - called `` burnt - bridge models '' ( bbm ) @xcite .",
    "according to bbm , the molecular motor is described as a random walker hopping along the one - dimensional lattice composed of two kinds of links : strong and weak .",
    "the walker does not affect the strong links when crossing them , while the weak links ( `` bridges '' ) might be destroyed ( `` burnt '' ) with a probability @xmath3 when crossed by the walker ; the walker can not pass over the destroyed links again . in refs .",
    "@xcite we developed a new analytical approach that allowed us to obtain exact expressions for motor protein velocity @xmath4 and dispersion @xmath5 for different sets of parameters and for different burnt - bridge models , and it was shown that the analytical predictions are in full agreement with monte - carlo computer simulations .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations of collagenase dynamics @xcite conclude that this motor protein is rather weak : at standard conditions it exerts a stall force of @xmath6 0.02 pn , which is 100 times smaller than other conventional motor proteins @xcite , and thermodynamic efficiency of this motor protein is between 6 and 15@xmath7 , although it has a significantly larger processivity than conventional motor proteins @xcite .",
    "meantime , experimental studies of several collagenases capable of breaking collagen fibers @xcite indicate that in cells these enzymes are probably clustered together .",
    "computer simulations of the motion of rigidly bound dimers @xcite of collagenase molecules produced stall forces of the order of 5 pn , 10 - 100 times larger than the single motor protein , and it was suggested that cell surface - anchored clusters of collagenases might play an important role in cell motility .",
    "coupling of motor proteins can produce very efficient molecular motors and it can lead to interesting dynamic phenomena @xcite . however , the motion of dimer particles in the context of bbm has not been studied yet .",
    "the goal of the present work is to investigate theoretically the dynamics of dimer molecular motors in bbm using previously developed exact analytical approaches @xcite .",
    "we consider a molecular motor dimer as two particles connected by a rigid bond that move along two parallel infinite one - dimensional lattices ( a bond between the particles is perpendicular to the linear molecular tracks ) , with transition rates in both directions and the lattice spacing assumed to be equal to one , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the links connecting consecutive binding sites on the lattices fall in two categories . while the random walkers have no effect on the strong links , each of them destroys the weak ones with the probability @xmath0 when passing over them .",
    "after the weak link is broken , the particle is always assumed to be to the right of it , and all weak links are intact at @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the dimer can not be trapped between two burnt bridges , and it continuously moves to the right .",
    "lattice spacings . ]",
    "the bridge can be burnt according to one of the two scenarios . in the first mechanism ,",
    "the bridge burns only when the random walker crosses it from left to right , however it always remains intact if crossed from right to left .",
    "we term this model a forward bbm . according to the second model ,",
    "the weak link gets broken if crossed in either direction , although the particle is always found to the right of the broken bond .",
    "this is a forward - backward bbm .",
    "the physics of the driven motion is similar for both mechanisms , and both models are even identical for @xmath9 , however for @xmath10 the walker s dynamics in two cases are different @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider only forward bbm because theoretical analysis is simpler in this case .",
    "however , our approach can be easily extended to more complex forward - backward bbm .",
    "the dynamics of the dimer in bbm depends on two parameters : the burning probability @xmath0 and the concentration of bridges @xmath1 .",
    "the properties of the system are also strongly influenced by the distribution of bridges , periodic or random @xcite . in the case of the periodic distribution , which will be analyzed in detail in the present paper ,",
    "the bridges on each of two parallel one - dimensional lattices are positioned equidistantly , with a constant distance @xmath11 lattice spacings separating them .",
    "this distribution is more suited for the analysis of the transport of collagenases since the sites that can be destroyed by enzymes on collagen fibers are found to be at equal distances from each other @xcite .",
    "all the models presented below will be studied in the continuous - time description that better corresponds to the real biological systems with motor proteins @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the bridges on two parallel tracks are shifted by @xmath12 lattice spacings ( @xmath13 ) : see fig . 1 .",
    ") along the effective single linear track .",
    "]    let us consider first a special case of bbm with @xmath9 , i.e. , when a bridge burns every time when crossed by the walker .",
    "it can be easily seen that in this case the motion of a molecular motor dimer along two parallel tracks is equivalent to the motion of a single random walker on a single track but with increased concentration of bridges @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "the distribution of bridges on this effective track is again periodic but generally non - uniform , with two weak links in each period : between the sites @xmath14 and @xmath12 , and between the sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 : see fig.2 .",
    "the dynamics of this system can be mapped into a random single - particle hopping model on periodic lattices that was solved by derrida @xcite , in which the explicit expressions for the dynamic properties are obtained .",
    "we define the forward and backward transition rates for the random walker at site @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , correspondingly .",

    "the fluctuations of the particle in bbm are reduced near the already burned bridges because the particle can not cross them . in the case of the dimer",

    "the motion of the dimer on two parallel lattices can be viewed as the motion of the effective particle on a single lattice with larger concentration of bridges - as shown in fig .",

    "thus our analysis suggests that the dimer collagenases , in contrast with earlier claims @xcite , probably can not produce stall forces comparable to atp - driven motor proteins .",
    "the dynamics of rigid dimer particles moving along parallel molecular tracks in bbm is investigated theoretically using several analytical methods . when the probability of burning is equal to 1 , we utilized derrida s method @xcite for calculating explicitly dynamic properties of the system , and it allowed us to compute the effective forces exerted by the dimer molecular motor .",
    "for @xmath10 the situation when the bridges on the parallel tracks are shifted by half of the period , i.e. , @xmath102 , is also investigated in detail by mapping the system with two tracks into the motion along the single lattice with the distance between bridges being @xmath103 .",
    "more generally , for @xmath277 and arbitrary shifts between the tracks , our analysis produced exact analytical expressions for the velocity of the dimer .",
    "the dynamic properties and the force generated by the dimer are compared with corresponding properties for the monomer molecular motor . in all cases",
    "it was found that the ratio of the dimer s and the monomer s velocities can never exceed 2 ( which is the limit in case of small concentration of bridges @xmath1 or large values of the shift @xmath12 ) .",
    "we found that the force generated by the dimer is substantially larger than that generated by the monomer only for a special case of @xmath2 and @xmath88 .",
    "for other sets of parameters the force exerted by the dimer is at most only slightly more than twice as large as that exerted by the monomer .",
    "this occurs for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( with @xmath102 ) , in the latter case the significant difference between the forces generated by the dimer and the monomer at @xmath2 is present only if the burning probability @xmath0 is close to 1 .",
    "this result is in contradiction with earlier theoretical claims based on monte carlo computer simulations @xcite .",
    "these theoretical predictions are explained by the increase in the effective concentration of bridges .",
    "although our theoretical approach provides exact and explicit expressions for dynamic properties of dimer molecular motors in bbm , there are several features of the system that should be included in order to obtain more realistic description of dynamics of motor proteins that interact with their tracks .",
    "it was assumed that two motor proteins are tightly bound in the dimer , while in the cell the enzymes must have some flexibility .",
    "in addition , the interaction between motor proteins in the cluster was neglected , although it might lead to the increased dynamic efficiency , as was discussed earlier for different motor protein systems @xcite . also , it is not clear what effect on the dynamics of molecular motors will have random or non - uniform distributions of bridges .",
