    "it has been recognized for some time now that qso absorption line systems are particularly effective probes of large  scale structure in the universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the absorbers trace matter lying on the qso line of sight , which can extend over a sizable redshift interval out to high redshifts .",
    "thus , the absorbers trace both the large  scale structure ( on scales out to hundreds of mpc ) _ and _ its evolution in time , since the clustering pattern can be examined as a function of redshift out to @xmath17 .",
    "the evolution of large  scale structure is of great interest , since , in the gravitational instability picture , it depends sensitively on the mean mass density @xmath15 ( @xcite , 1993 ) .",
    "we are not concerned here with the relationship between the absorbers and galaxy haloes , or with small  scale structure . however , in another paper ( @xcite ) we discuss the small  scale clustering of absorbers and relate it to galaxy clustering .    in this letter , we present results of an analysis of line  of  sight correlations of  absorption line systems , using a new and extensive catalog of absorbers ( @xcite ) .",
    "this catalog contains data on all qso heavy  element absorption lines in the literature , complete up to december 1995 , with some additional entries since then .",
    "it is an updated version of the catalog of york  ( 1991 ) , but is more than twice the size , with over 2200 absorbers listed over 500 qsos , and is the largest sample of heavy  element absorbers compiled to date .",
    "more details can be found in the earlier version of the catalog , as well as in our recent paper ( @xcite ) in which we find that the number of absorbers is correlated with the intrinsic brightness of the qso , suggesting that qsos are lensed by matter associated with the absorbers .",
    "a preliminary study suggests that the absorber correlation function is not strongly dependent on the intrinsic brightness of the qso .",
    "we describe the correlation analysis in  2 , present our results in  3 , and discuss the implications of these in  4 .",
    "here we briefly describe our procedure for calculating the line  of  sight correlation function , @xmath18 . unless otherwise noted , we take @xmath3 and @xmath19 .",
    "we follow the usual convention and take @xmath20 to be the hubble constant in units of 100 km  s@xmath21  mpc@xmath21 .    to produce a more uniform set of absorbers from the inhomogeneous catalog , we have applied the following selection criteria to the qso spectra and absorbers .",
    "the ly@xmath22 forest region of each spectrum was excluded because identification of heavy ",
    "element lines there is problematic .",
    "this means we examine absorbers within about 60,000 km  s@xmath21 , or about 400 , of the qso .",
    "the so  called associated region within 5000 km s@xmath21 of each qso emission redshift has also been excluded , since the number density of absorbers there may not be representative of that for absorbers farther removed in redshift from their qsos ( @xcite ) . thus a typical redshift range for a line of sight",
    "is @xmath23 .",
    "all of the selected absorption systems must at least have an identified  doublet , and if no other line was identified , the equivalent width ratio of the 1548  component to the 1551  component must be @xmath24 within the listed measurement errors .",
    "in addition , the equivalent width of the 1548  component must have been detected at more than the @xmath25 level , and have a rest value of at least @xmath26  . in order to avoid aliasing of power ( @xcite ) on the large scales of interest because of the very pronounced peak in the correlation function on small scales ( @xcite )",
    ", we have combined all absorbers lying within 3.5 comoving of each other ( @xmath27 km s@xmath21 ) into a single system with redshift equal to the average redshift of the components and with equivalent width equal to that of the strongest component .",
    "because of this , we have included only spectra with resolutions that allow absorber comoving separations @xmath28  to be resolved .",
    "these selection criteria leave a total of 360 absorption systems , with redshifts from 1.2 to 4.5 , scattered among 373 qso lines of sight .",
    "the distribution in the total number of absorbers over the line of sight is consistent with that from a uniform distribution . for number of absorbers per line of sight 0 through 7 , the observed versus expected number of lines of sight are ( 207 , 190.34 ) , ( 67 , 82.52 ) , ( 49 , 52.23 ) , ( 22 , 28.24 ) , ( 16 , 12.92 ) , ( 9 , 4.61 ) , ( 1 , 1.60 ) , and ( 2 , 0.39 ) .",
    "a ks  test shows that the two distributions are consistent with each other ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this shows that the average distribution of absorbers on 400  scales is uniform .",
    "to study the distribution on smaller scales , we use the  line  of  sight correlation function , @xmath18 , which is calculated by binning the comoving separation , @xmath30 , of absorber pairs and comparing the number of real pairs , @xmath31 , in a bin to the average number of pairs , @xmath32 , generated from 100 monte carlo simulations ; namely , @xmath33 .",
    "the simulated absorber samples are generated by randomly redistributing all of the real absorbers among the qso spectra , subject to the condition that the absorbers could have been detected in both redshift and equivalent width in their randomly selected qso spectra .",
    "this technique is possible because the catalog of absorbers lists the wavelength limits and equivalent width limits for each of the listed qso spectra .",
    "this technique has the virtue that the redshift and equivalent width number densities of all the simulated data sets are exactly the same as for the real data set , so that the real and simulated data sets have the same evolution of physical properties as a function of redshift .",
    "the @xmath34 region of scatter around the null hypothesis of no clustering ( @xmath35 ) is given by the standard deviation of @xmath18 in the 100 random simulations , whereas the @xmath34 error in the estimator of @xmath36 in each @xmath30 bin is @xmath37 ( @xcite ) .",
    "when clustering is present , these errors will be different .",
    "the size and extent of the absorber catalog of vanden berk   ( 1996a ) permits exploration of clustering over an unprecedented range in scale ( from about 1 to over 300 ) _ and _ redshift ( @xmath0 from 1.2 to 4.5 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the line  of  sight correlation function of absorbers , @xmath38 , as a function of absorber comoving separation , @xmath30 , for the entire sample of absorbers .",
    "the results are shown for both a @xmath3 ( _ top panel _ , 25  bins ) and a @xmath13 ( _ bottom panel _ , 60  bins ) cosmology . because , at high redshift , a larger comoving separation @xmath30 arises from a fixed redshift interval @xmath39 . ]",
    "the vertical error bars through the data points are @xmath34 errors in the estimator for @xmath18 , which differ from the @xmath34 region of scatter ( _ dashed line _ , calculated by monte carlo using the bootstrap technique described above ) around the no  clustering null hypothesis .",
    "remarkably , there appears to be significant clustering in the first four bins of figure  1 : the mean correlation for those bins is @xmath5 ( @xmath3 ) or @xmath40 ( @xmath13 ) . here",
    "the errors quoted are the @xmath34 errors in the estimate of the correlation function ( corresponding to the error bars in figure 1 ) . in assessing the significance of these results , however , the appropriate measure of departure from uniformity is the @xmath34 region of scatter around the null hypothesis ( corresponding to the dashed lines in figure 1 ) , which equals 0.085 ( @xmath3 ) or 0.082 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , the positive correlation seen in the first four bins of figure  1 has a significance of @xmath41 , if @xmath3 , and @xmath42 if @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , there is significant evidence of clustering of matter traced by  absorbers on scales up to 100  ( @xmath3 ) or 240   ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "there is no evidence from figure  1 for clustering on comoving scales greater than these .",
    "the mean correlation of the last six bins in figure  1 is @xmath43 ( @xmath3 or 0.1 ) , which is consistent with zero .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of the superclustering by dividing the absorber sample into three approximately equal redshift sub  samples .",
    "figure  2 shows @xmath38 , as a function of absorber comoving separation , @xmath30 ( @xmath3 ) , for low ( @xmath44 , _ top panel _ ) , medium ( @xmath45 , _ middle panel _ ) , and high ( @xmath46 , _ bottom panel _ ) redshift absorber sub  samples .",
    "larger bins for the comoving separation were used in figure  2 because of the smaller number of absorbers in each sub  sample .",
    "the error bars are as in figure  1 .",
    "the correlation function estimator is positive in the first two bins ( corresponding to scales of 100  and less , like the first four bins in figure  1 , _ top panel _ ) in all three panels of figure  2 : the mean correlation ( @xmath3 ) is @xmath47 for the low redshift sub  sample , @xmath48 for the medium redshift sub  sample , and @xmath49 for the high redshift sub  sample .",
    "the values for @xmath13 are essentially the same as these .    thus , the significant superclustering seen in figure  1 is present in all three redshift sub ",
    "samples in figure  2 , so that the superclustering is present even at redshift @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , it does not appear that the superclustering scale , in comoving coordinates , has changed significantly since then .",
    "we have found evidence for the existence of large  scale superclustering that has existed since redshift @xmath51 and has a comoving scale @xmath52  ( @xmath3 ) or 240  ( @xmath13 ) that has not changed much since then .",
    "we have examined the clustering signal more closely and find that a large portion comes from 7 qso lines of sight that have groups of 4 or more  absorbers within a 100  interval ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "( from monte carlo simulations , we expect only @xmath53 qsos with such groups . ) when these are removed , the mean correlation function on scales of 100  and less ( @xmath3 ) is @xmath54 .",
    "table 1 lists these 7 qsos , along with the properties of their groups of  absorbers .",
    "several of the groups in table 1 have been previously identified as potential superclusters ( @xcite ) ; indeed , superclustering has been suggested because of an unusual concentration of absorbers , within several tens of megaparsecs , in the lines of sight of 10372704 and 10382712 ( @xcite ) , and 0237233 ( @xcite ) . however , there was concern that any inferred superclustering might be overestimated because of aliasing of small  scale power .",
    "like dinshaw & impey ( 1996 ) , we find that superclustering is _ not _ caused by aliasing , since it remains after combining all absorbers lying within 3.5  of each other into a single system .",
    "( for example , we count the 11 absorbers of 0237233 in a 100 interval as being 4 independent systems . )",
    "we have found two potential superclusters in the spectra of qsos 2126158 and 2359 + 068 , at redshift @xmath12 .",
    "the superclustering is indicative of generic large ",
    "scale clustering in the universe , out to high redshift @xmath50 , on a scale frozen in comoving coordinates that is  if @xmath3  similar to the size of the voids and walls in galaxy redshift surveys of the local universe ( @xmath4 ) , such as the cfa survey ( @xcite ) and others ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also appears consistent with the general finding of broadhurst  ( 1990 ) that galaxies are clustered on very large scales , although we have not confirmed that there is quasi  periodic clustering with power peaked at 128 .",
    "it may also have been found in quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "our estimate of the superclustering scale increases to 240  if @xmath13 ( see figure  1 ) , which is larger than the largest scales of clustering known at present .",
    "if the structures traced by  absorbers are of the same nature as those seen locally in galaxy redshift surveys , the superclustering scale should have a value closer to 100  .",
    "this may be indicative of a larger value of @xmath14 , and hence @xmath15 .    in figure  3",
    ", we show the mean correlation function , @xmath55 , on scales of 50  and less , as a function of redshift @xmath0 , for the entire data set of absorbers ( _ solid symbols _ ) , and for strong  absorbers ( @xcite , _ open symbol _ ) , with @xmath3 . also shown",
    "is its expected dependence on redshift , calculated from the growth factor ( @xcite , 1993 ) , normalized to the sample mean correlation of 0.48 at the sample median redshift of @xmath56 , for @xmath57 ( _ solid line _ ) and @xmath58 ( _ dashed line _ ) . while the evolution of the correlation function on 50  scales is consistent with that expected in cosmologies with density parameter ranging from @xmath16 0.1 to 1 , the sloan digital sky survey should give better estimates for @xmath55 ( see the typical error bar at the upper right of figure  3 ) and will be able to constrain @xmath15 to 20% .",
    "it is possible that structures of size @xmath52 may have arisen through the zeldovich `` pancake '' scenario ( @xcite ) , and that this particular scale has deep significance because it is of order the horizon size at decoupling , and is the scale on which an `` acoustic peak '' is expected in the initial power spectrum of many cosmologies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of clustering on scales greater than 100 has implications on the peak and turn  over scale of the power spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "we acknowledge helpful discussions with don lamb , paul ricker , bob rosner , and alex szalay , and statistical comments by carlo graziani .",
