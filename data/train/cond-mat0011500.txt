    "one of the most striking phenomena in high temperature superconductors @xcite is the pseudogap observed in the single - particle spectral density and other quantities way above the critical temperature for underdoped samples.@xcite a natural explanation of the pseudogap invokes pairing tendencies above the pair condensation scale .",
    "the reduced dimensionality of the cuprate planes and the short coherence length of cooper pairs in the cuprate superconductors both favor an enhanced influence of pairing fluctuations .",
    "a popular model allowing the investigation of pairing in two dimensions without complications coming from other , especially magnetic , fluctuations is the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model.@xcite at low temperatures this model has a superconducting phase with s - wave pairing .",
    "the existence of a pseudogap for single - particle and spin excitations in the normal phase of the attractive hubbard model has been established at intermediate to strong coupling by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations.@xcite for very strong coupling the pseudogap is a natural consequence of binding of fermions in almost local pairs , but the pseudogap has been shown to appear also at more moderate coupling strengths , where the momentum distribution function still resembles a fermi distribution .",
    "pseudogap behavior in single - particle spectra of the attractive hubbard model has also been obtained within the selfconsistent t - matrix approximation ( tma ) at very low densities.@xcite in the low density limit two - particle bound states form already at weak coupling in two dimensions,@xcite and the chemical potential can move into the gap between the energy of a bound state and the single - particle band . at a band - filling of about ten percent and intermediate coupling only some weak tendencies towards gap formation appear within the self - consistent tma,@xcite and at larger densities standard fermi liquid behavior seems to be restored completely at weak and moderate coupling.@xcite    in this work we analyze how pairing fluctuations affect the spectral function for single - particle excitations in the attractive hubbard model at _ weak coupling _ and intermediate ( not very small ) densities . to this end",
    ", we compute the self - energy and the spectral function within the _ non - selfconsistent _ t - matrix approximation . using a real - frequency formulation of the t - matrix equations @xcite and exploiting kramers - kronig relations we calculate the resulting spectral function with unprecedented accuracy and energy resolution . in this way we are able to detect a dramatic drop of spectral weight at the fermi level for temperatures close to the superconducting transition temperature even at weak coupling .",
    "this pseudogap behavior is caused exclusively by strong pairing fluctuations with small center - of - mass momenta precursing the superconducting instability .",
    "it can therefore be captured qualitatively within a time - dependent ginzburg - landau expansion of these fluctuations.@xcite the gap is not related to two - particle bound states with large center - of - mass momenta .",
    "our results are in complete agreement with a classical ( i.e.   thermal ) pairing fluctuation scenario which has been proposed recently as an explanation for pseudogap behavior in the two - dimensional hubbard model at intermediate coupling strength.@xcite",

    "it can clearly be seen that upon decreasing @xmath48 a sharp peak develops in @xmath49 at @xmath50 .",

    "the gap width increases obviously faster than linearly with @xmath24 .    for other wave vectors on the fermi surface",
    "the behavior does not change much .",
    "the pseudogap is however less pronounced for @xmath66 on the diagonal in the brillouin zone , compared to wave vectors on the axes ( for fixed parameters ) .",

    "this peak is due to the contribution of poles in the vertex function at large momenta associated with two - particle bound states .",
    "satellite peaks in the spectral function caused by bound states have also been obtained earlier within the self - consistent t - matrix approximation.@xcite at quarter - filling the bound states contribute to the spectral function at an energy which lies within the energy range of the much larger contribution from scattering states , and is therefore hidden by the latter .",
    "a pseudogap in the single - particle excitation spectrum of the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model at finite ( not very small ) density has been found previously only at intermediate and strong coupling strengths , namely by quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite and within a renormalized t - matrix approximation.@xcite at weak coupling the temperature window for pseudogap behavior is very small , and @xmath19 has to be very close to the fermi surface for a gap to appear in the spectral function @xmath69 .",

    "thermal pairing fluctuations have already been invoked by vilk et al .",

    "these authors showed that classical pairing fluctuations can lead to pseudogaps if the correlation length @xmath70 of these fluctuations is not only large , but also larger than the thermal de broglie wave length @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the fermi velocity .",
    "indeed , we observed at quarter - filling , where the fermi velocity varies already considerably along the fermi line , that the pseudogap is more pronounced at fermi points with a smaller @xmath72 .",
    "the dominant long - range part of the pairing fluctuations can be described effectively using a ginzburg - landau expansion of the ( diverging ) vertex function .",
    "capezzali and beck @xcite have recently shown that such an expansion captures the singular self - energy contributions which lead to a pseudogap in the spectral function in two dimensions .",
    "we have investigated one - particle spectral properties of the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model at weak coupling in the normal phase close to the superconducting transition temperature , using the non - selfconsistent t - matrix approximation . for temperatures sufficiently close to the transition temperature",

    "@xcite works also at weak coupling .",
    "they agree qualitatively with results obtained recently within a ginzburg - landau treatment of such fluctuations.@xcite hence , the spectral properties of the two - dimensional attractive hubbard model seem to evolve smoothly when moving from weak to strong coupling , that is there seems to be no critical coupling strength at which the behavior changes _",
    "qualitatively_. the size of the energy window where pairing fluctuations are important becomes of course very small at weak coupling , such that a high numerical accuracy is required to see the effect . in two dimensions",
    "the behavior is thus different than in three - dimensional @xcite and infinite - dimensional @xcite systems , where gaps open in the normal state only for a sufficiently strong attraction .",
    "it is clear that the non - selfconsistent t - matrix approximation breaks down in the limit @xmath73 , since the propagator is dramatically renormalized at the fermi level .",
    "contributions not contained in the tma may modify the shape of the pseudogap in the limit @xmath73 , even at weak coupling .",
    "the selfconsistent tma will hardly provide a better approximation since vertex corrections are likely to become important as soon as self - energy insertions contribute significantly.@xcite none of the tma versions captures the kosterlitz - thouless physics of the true superconducting phase transition .",
    "improved theories should take vertex and self - energy corrections into account on an equal footing .",
    "an improvement of the tma which agrees better with qmc results for the attractive hubbard model at intermediate coupling strengths has been proposed very recently by allen and tremblay @xcite and evaluated in detail by kyung et al.@xcite the bare interaction is replaced by a renormalized interaction which is determined by consistency requirements in this approach .",
    "an advantage of this renormalized scheme compared to the standard t - matrix is that the temperature window for normal state pseudogap behavior becomes larger , in agreement with qmc results at intermediate coupling .",
    "however , @xmath24 is suppressed too much by fluctuations in this approach , namely down to zero in two dimensions , and the expected kosterlitz - thouless behavior ( at densities @xmath74 ) is not captured .",
    "the true @xmath24 indeed vanishes only in the half - filled limit ( @xmath75 ) , where superconductivity would have to break a larger @xmath76 symmetry , which leads to stronger order parameter fluctuations and thus to a further enhancement of the pseudogap regime.@xcite by contrast , in the standard t - matrix approximation ( self - consistent or not ) the order parameter fluctuations are always underestimated since the phase transition is mean - field like , and the pseudogap regime appears thus too small",
    ".    functional renormalization group methods , where vertex corrections are automatically included , should provide another promising approach to pseudogap physics .",
