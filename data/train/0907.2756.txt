    "more recently , a critical behavior was observed in dc tunneling experiments @xcite , which had also been predicted @xcite but failed to appear in all prior experiments .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to elucidate on the requirements to observe such a critical behavior .",
    "our studies demonstrate that the coherent tunneling not only intensifies with the size of the sample but more importantly that the critical current grows linearly with the @xmath3 area . in order to deliver a thorough picture of the critical tunneling behavior",
    "we first briefly address those experimental conditions which can easily be manipulated , such as effective layer separation @xmath6 , temperature and filling factor , before discussing the more relevant size dependence .",
    "our data are obtained from samples of two different wafers grown in two different molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) machines ( hereby referred to as wafer @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) , both with a net barrier thickness of 9.6  nm , consisting of alternating alas ( 1.70  nm ) and gaas ( 0.28  nm ) layers .",

    "as the interlayer phase coherence at @xmath3 allows to easily transfer charges between the layers , the tunnel conductance becomes enormously enhanced which is tantamount to a very small tunnel resistance .",
    "consequently , even if there is a finite bias @xmath21 applied , the interlayer voltage probes a and b ( located close to source and drain ) may read a value for @xmath22 of close to zero ( figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "however , this coherent tunneling can be destroyed if the current ( figure [ fig1 ] ( c ) ) exceeds a critical value @xmath23 .",

    "the data here are presented in a scatter plot which show a discontinuity in the measured current and voltage characteristics when the system moves from the coherent strong tunneling regime into the weak tunneling regime .",
    "the origin of this negative differential conductance is the sudden change in the total impedance @xmath27 , when a tunneling resistance @xmath28 of almost zero is replaced by a resistance much larger than the series resistance @xmath29 of the ( uncorrelated ) quantum hall systems , i.e. , @xmath30 .",

    "are exchanged between two individual two - dimensional electron systems , a process which now requires a finite amount of energy to overcome the coulomb repulsion between the electrons .",

    "while drifting to either side of @xmath3 , the critical tunneling behavior is getting progressively suppressed around zero bias .",
    "our data suggest that moving toward higher fields suppresses the tunneling slightly more rapidly than in the opposite low field direction as the coulomb exchange increases with @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] ( b ) gives a quantitative analysis of the maximum ( critical ) current as a function of the total filling factor .",
    "note that only the eight plots in the center of figure [ fig4 ] ( a ) allowed the determination of a maximal current .",

    "iv is thus to outline the effects of manipulating temperature and effective layer separation @xmath6 which largely influence the magnitude of the critical current as well .",
    "the latter is achieved experimentally by increasing the electron densities in both layers simultaneously and adjusting the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] ( a ) shows the positive and negative critical currents as a function of @xmath6 for a hall bar sample of 0.88  @xmath15  0.08  mm@xmath16 ( wafer @xmath8 ) at below 20  mk .",
    "for @xmath37 the current appears to saturate at 2  na , even to decrease .",
    "this however is related to the effect of the sample s very low electron density , which begins to suppress the transport current altogether ( the single layer density is roughly 1.65  @xmath15  10@xmath38  m@xmath39 ) . for intermediate @xmath6 on the other hand",
    "the trend is clearly linear . for @xmath40",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition and the critical tunneling behavior ( and the @xmath3 qh state ) disappears .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with those found in magneto - transport @xcite or tunneling - spectroscopy experiments @xcite .",
    "generally , if the onset of the @xmath3 state is observed at @xmath41 , its origin is a pure many - body effect , and in weakly tunneling samples ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) the phase - coherence would develop spontaneously @xcite .",
    "the smooth phase transition we observed supports a `` puddle model '' as suggested by a. stern and b. i. halperin @xcite where the @xmath3 phase breaks up into domains near the phase boundary . in this model",

    "the expected phase transition for correlated bilayers occurring at finite temperatures is not a regular second order phase transition such as for normal superconductors at zero field or ferromagnets but a kosterlitz - thouless type of phase transition .",
    "however , standard transport experiments are not able to judge type and form of the occurring phase transition .",
    "nevertheless , what we see experimentally in transport ( i.e. , tunneling ) at finite temperatures is summarized in figure [ fig3 ] ( b ) . there we plot the critical current as a function of the inverse temperature for a fixed @xmath33 measured on a hall bar sample of 0.88  @xmath15  0.08  mm@xmath16 ( wafer @xmath7 ) .",

    "extrapolation of the data in this region indicates the suppression of the critical behavior for temperatures above 250  mk .",
    "the @xmath3 qh state as observed in magneto - transport is very weak at 250  mk and disappears entirely at temperatures exceeding approximately 350  mk @xcite .",
    "the exact type of this phase transition is unknown to us .",
    "spielman @xcite found similar overall trends on the temperature and @xmath6 in tunneling spectroscopy measurements using samples which display very small critical currents .",
    "the following study of the size dependence was motivated by magneto - transport and tunneling measurements performed on a corbino ring @xcite .",
    "these experiments had shown a vanishing conductance across the annulus , suggesting that the bulk of the @xmath3 phase is incompressible .",
    "as any interedge charge transfer is suppressed , tunneling would then ( generally ) only occur in the vicinity of the edges of the coherent @xmath3 system and its magnitude would have to scale with the circumference of the sample .",
    "tunneling spectroscopy measurements on hall bar samples on the other hand indicated that the zero bias tunneling conductance may be related to the area of the sample instead @xcite . to obtain a better understanding and trying to solve this contradiction we compared the critical currents , rather the properties of the tsm tunneling peak , in terms of the circumference and area . comparing different samples of course may introduce a systematic error , yet we still found that the effect of different sample sizes had much more dramatic consequences as we will see next .",

    "our data clearly indicates that the critical current @xmath23 grows as the sample increases in size .",
    "when we apply a linear fit in the @xmath49 diagram , we find that the trend is best described by 1.04@xmath50 for the area and 2.11@xmath51 for the circumference .",
    "based on these data we propose that the parameter that determines coherent tunneling at @xmath3 is the sample area with a linear dependence and not the circumference .",

    "the situation and the absolute values are reversed , i.e. , @xmath53 and @xmath54(upsweep)=@xmath55(downsweep ) .",
    "for that reason , the fits in figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) ignore the error bar of these data points .    for comparison we extracted a critical current of 17  pa at @xmath44  1.6 from @xcite .",
    "this value originates from the dc part of a tsm on a 250  @xmath15  250  @xmath14m@xmath16 sample .",
    "we believe that the disagreement between our data and this value is related to a different single particle tunneling splitting @xmath13 , which is determined by the height and width of the tunneling barrier , and to the large enhancement of the tunneling amplitude at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "their double quantum well is differently designed , with 18 nm gaas quantum wells separated by a 9.9  nm barrier layer .",
    "the center - to - center separation @xmath4 , however , is nearly identical to ours .    our studies indicate that the initial notion of a length dependence on tunneling as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter is a misinterpretation due to the astonishing properties of the coherent phase .",
    "coherent inter - edge tunneling in a corbino topology is suppressed because injected electrons do not become part of the @xmath3 state . in the excitonic condensate picture",
    "this can be understood as it is impossible for the condensate to create an interlayer exciton by placing a hole at the site of the injected electron , when the drain lead where the hole has to originate from is far away on the other side of the bulk .",
    "true coherent tunneling on the other hand occurs when new interlayer excitons are created or existing ones are annihilated .",
    "these processes appear to be bulk phenomena after all .",
    "however , as the @xmath3 phase could break up into domains near the phase boundary @xcite , it is possible that certain physical conditions may arise which yield a different dependence on the area ( and circumference ) than the one presented here .",
    "generally , the observation of a critical behavior requires - vaguely speaking - `` sufficiently large samples '' .",
    "the tangible sample size depends on the underlying design of the double quantum well and the sample structure , but may also be influenced by other unknown factors .",
    "more specifically , our studies identify the area rather than the circumference as the determining parameter for coherent tunneling at @xmath3 .",
    "a tunneling experiment in the general sense of charge transfer between two electron reservoirs through a sufficiently thin barrier is an inappropriate interpretation for the peculiar case of the total filling factor one state . instead ,",
    "as the two layers are considered to be indistinguishable , correlated interlayer tunneling is a direct signature of interlayer phase coherence .",
    "the model of indistinguishable layers also implies that the critical behavior and its dependence on the parameters we discussed in this paper have several implications for magneto - transport experiments performed in the regime of the total filling factor one state @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the leakage or tunneling current in the counterflow configuration @xcite depends on whether the driving current in the system is larger or smaller than the critical current for a given condition @xcite , i.e. , @xmath6 , temperature and sample size .",
    "the observed gap in magneto - transport on the other hand is only slightly altered .",
    "it nevertheless implies that temperature - activation measurements at a total filling factor of one @xcite require a much more careful interpretation of the gap energy .",
    "what makes matters experimentally complicated is the strong dependence of the critical current @xmath23 on the size of the sample , meaning that for samples of certain dimensions the transport current may already be much larger than the critical current , even when the system is at base temperature .",
    "this fact could be able to account for several unsettled observations such as finite dissipation in counterflow experiments for example @xcite .",
    "future magneto - transport experiments in the regime of the coherent total filling factor one state need to take the relevance of the driving current into account .",
    "in summary , we discussed the relevant parameters necessary for the observation of a critical behavior in the coherent @xmath3 state .",
    "we find a linear dependence of the value of the critical tunneling current @xmath23 on the @xmath3 area of the sample .",
    "@xmath23 will decrease when the system is brought toward the phase boundary by increasing @xmath6 or the temperature .",
