    "clustering is a useful technique to detect the underlying cluster structure of the data set .",
    "the goal of clustering is to partition a set of objects @xmath2 into @xmath1 small subgroups @xmath3 based on a well defined measure of similarities between patterns . to measure the similarities ( or dissimilarities ) , the objects are described by either object data or relational data .",
    "object data are described explicitly by a feature vector , while relational data arise from the pairwise similarities or dissimilarities . among the existing approaches to clustering ,",
    "the objective function - driven or prototype - based clustering such as @xmath0-means ( cm ) and fuzzy @xmath0-means ( fcm ) is one of the most widely applied paradigms in statistical pattern recognition .",
    "these methods are based on a fundamentally very simple , but nevertheless very effective idea , namely to describe the data under consideration by a set of prototypes .",
    "they capture the characteristics of the data distribution ( like location , size , and shape ) , and classify the data set based on the similarities ( or dissimilarities ) of the objects to their prototypes .",
    "the above mentioned clustering algorithms , cm and fcm are for object data .",
    "the prototype of each class in these methods is the center of gravity of all the included patterns .",
    "but for relational data set , it is difficult to determine the centers of objects . in this case ,",
    "one of the objects which is most similar to the center could be the most rational choice to be setting as the prototype .",
    "this is the idea of clustering using medoids .",
    "some clustering methods , such as partitioning around medoids ( pam ) @xcite and fuzzy @xmath0-medoids ( fcmdd ) @xcite , produce hard and soft clusters where each of them is represented by a representative object ( medoid ) .",
    "belief functions have already been applied in many fields , such as data classification @xcite , data clustering @xcite , social network analysis @xcite and statistical estimation @xcite .",
    "evidential @xmath0-means ( ecm ) @xcite is a newly proposed clustering method to get credal partitions for object data .",
    "the credal partition is a general extension of the crisp ( hard ) and fuzzy ones and it allows the object to belong to not only single clusters , but also any subsets of the set of clusters @xmath4 by allocating a mass of belief for each object in @xmath5 over the power set @xmath6 .",
    "the additional flexibility brought by the power set provides more refined partitioning results than those by the other techniques allowing us to gain a deeper insight into the data @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we introduce an extension of fcmdd on the framework of belief functions . the evidential clustering algorithm for relational data sets , named ecmdd , using a medoid which is assumed to belong to the original data set to represent a class",
    "are proposed to produce the optimal credal partition .",
    "the experimental results show the effectiveness of the methods and illustrate the advantages of credal partitions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , some basic knowledge and the rationale of our method are briefly introduced . in section",
    "iii the proposed ecmdd clustering approach is presented in detail . in section",
    "iv we test ecmdd using various data sets and compare it with several other classical methods . finally , we conclude and present some perspectives in section v.",
    "let @xmath7 be the finite domain of @xmath5 , called the discernment frame .",
    "the belief functions are defined on the power set @xmath8 .    the function @xmath9 $ ]",
    "is said to be the basic belief assignment ( bba ) on @xmath6 , if it satisfies : @xmath10 every @xmath11 such that @xmath12 is called a focal element .",
    "the credibility and plausibility functions are defined as in eq.@xmath13 and eq.@xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15    @xmath16    each quantity @xmath17 measures the total support given to @xmath18 , while @xmath19 represents potential amount of support to @xmath18 .",
    "a belief function on the credal level can be transformed into a probability function by smets method @xcite . in this algorithm ,",
    "each mass of belief @xmath20 is equally distributed among the elements of @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to the concept of pignistic probability , @xmath21 , defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of elements of @xmath24 in @xmath18 .",
    "evidential @xmath1-means @xcite is a direct generalization of fcm in the framework of belief functions based on the concept of credal partitions .",
    "the credal partition takes advantage of imprecise ( meta ) classes to express partial knowledge of class memberships . in ecm",
    ", the evidential membership of an object @xmath25 is represented by a bba @xmath26 @xmath27 over the given frame of discernment @xmath24 .",
    "the set @xmath28 contains all the focal elements .",
    "the optimal credal partition is obtained by minimizing the following objective function : @xmath29 constrained on @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the bba of @xmath25 given to the nonempty set @xmath33 , while @xmath34 is the bba of @xmath25 assigned to the empty set .",
    "parameter @xmath35 is a tuning parameter allowing to control the degree of penalization for subsets with high cardinality , parameter @xmath36 is a weighting exponent and @xmath37 is an adjustable threshold for detecting the outliers . here",

    "let @xmath59 , @xmath60 represent a subset of @xmath61 .",
    "the objective function of fcmdd is given as @xmath62 subject to @xmath63 and @xmath64 in fact , the objective function of fcmdd is similar to that of fcm .",
    "the main difference lies in that the prototype of a class in fcmdd is defined as the medoid , _",
    "i.e. , _ one of the object in the original data set , instead of the centroid ( the average point in a continues space ) for fcm .",
    "fcmdd is preformed by the following alternating update steps :    * assignment update : @xmath65 * prototype update : the new prototype of cluster @xmath66 is set to be @xmath67 with @xmath68",
    "here we introduce evidential @xmath1-medoids clustering algorithm using medoids in order to take advantages of both medoid - based clustering and credal partitions .",
    "this partitioning evidential clustering algorithm is mainly related to fuzzy @xmath1-medoids .",
    "like all the prototype - based clustering methods , for ecmdd , an objective function should first be found to provide an immediate measure of the quality of partitions .",
    "hence our goal can be characterized as the optimization of the objective function to get the best credal partition .",
    "as before , let @xmath55 be the set of @xmath56 objects and @xmath57 denote the dissimilarity between objects @xmath25 and @xmath58 . the pairwise dissimilarity is the only information required for the analyzed data set .",
    "the objective function of ecmdd is similar to that in ecm : @xmath69 constrained on @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the bba of @xmath25 given to the nonempty set @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the bba of @xmath25 assigned to the empty set , and @xmath74 is the dissimilarity between @xmath25 and focal set @xmath72 .",
    "parameters @xmath75 are adjustable with the same meanings as those in ecm . note that @xmath76 depends on the credal partition @xmath77 and the set @xmath78 of all prototypes .",
    "let @xmath79 be the prototype of specific cluster ( whose focal element is a singleton ) @xmath80 @xmath81 and assume that it must be one of the objects in @xmath5 .",
    "the dissimilarity between object @xmath25 and cluster ( focal set ) @xmath72 can be defined as follows . if @xmath82 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath72 is associated with one of the singleton clusters in @xmath24 ( suppose to be @xmath83 with prototype @xmath79 , _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath80 ) , then the dissimilarity between @xmath25 and @xmath72 is defined by @xmath84 when @xmath85 , it represents an imprecise ( meta ) cluster .",
    "if object @xmath25 is to be partitioned into a meta cluster , two conditions should be satisfied @xcite .",
    "one condition is the dissimilarity values between @xmath25 and the included singleton classes prototypes are small .",
    "the other condition is the object should be close to the prototypes of all these specific clusters .",
    "the former measures the degree of uncertainty , while the latter is to avoid the pitfall of partitioning two data objects irrelevant to any included specific clusters into the corresponding imprecise classes . therefore , the medoid ( prototype ) of an imprecise class @xmath72 could be set to be one of the objects locating with similar dissimilarities to all the prototypes of the specific classes @xmath86 included in @xmath72 . the variance of the dissimilarities of object @xmath25 to the medoids of all the included specific classes of @xmath72 could be taken into account to express the degree of uncertainty .",
    "the smaller the variance is , the higher uncertainty we have for object @xmath25 .",
    "meanwhile the medoid should be close to all the prototypes of the specific classes .",
    "this is to distinguish the outliers , which may have equal dissimilarities to the prototypes of some specific classes , but obviously not a good choice for representing the associated imprecise classes .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the medoid of class @xmath72 denotes the prototype of specific class @xmath83 , thus it is in the framework of @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , @xmath87 is defined on the power set @xmath88 , representing the prototype of the focal set @xmath72 @xmath89 .",
    "it is easy to see @xmath90 . ] .",
    "based on the above analysis , the medoid of @xmath72 should set to @xmath91 with @xmath92 where @xmath83 is the element of @xmath72 , @xmath79 is its corresponding prototype and @xmath93 denotes the function describing the variance among the corresponding dissimilarity values .",
    "the variance function could be used directly : @xmath94 ^ 2.\\ ] ] in this paper , we use the following function to describe the variance @xmath95 of the dissimilarities between object @xmath25 and the medoids of the involved specific classes in @xmath72 : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of combinations of the given @xmath98 elements taken @xmath99 at a time .",
    "the dissimilarity between objects @xmath25 and class @xmath72 can be defined as @xmath100 as we can see from the above equation , the dissimilarity between object @xmath25 and meta class @xmath72 ( @xmath85 ) is the weighted average of dissimilarities of @xmath25 to the all involved singleton cluster medoids and to the prototype of the imprecise class @xmath72 with a tuning factor @xmath101 .",
    "if @xmath72 is a specific class with @xmath80 ( @xmath102 ) , the dissimilarity between @xmath58 and @xmath72 degrades to the dissimilarity between @xmath25 and @xmath103 as defined in eq .  , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath104 . and",
    "if @xmath85 , its medoid is decided by eq .  .",
    "it is remarkable that although ecmdd is similar to median evidential @xmath0-means ( mecm ) @xcite algorithm in principle , but they are very different in dealing with the imprecise classes and the way of calculating the dissimilarities between objects and imprecise classes .",
    "although both mecm and ecmdd consider the dissimilarities of objects to the prototypes for specific clusters , the strategy adopted by ecmdd is more simple and intuitive .",
    "moreover , there is no representative medoid for imprecise classes in mecm .      to minimize @xmath76 , an optimization scheme via an expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm can be designed , and the alternate update steps are as follows :    step 1 .",
    "credal partition ( @xmath77 ) update .",
    "the bbas of objects class membership for any subset @xmath105 and the empty set @xmath106 representing the outliers are updated identically to ecm @xcite :    * @xmath107 , @xmath108 * if @xmath109 , @xmath110    step 2 .",
    "prototype ( @xmath78 ) update .",
    "the prototype @xmath111 of a specific ( singleton ) cluster @xmath112 @xmath113 can be updated first and then the prototypes of imprecise ( meta ) classes could be determined by eq .  .",
    "for singleton clusters @xmath83 @xmath81 , the corresponding new prototype @xmath79 @xmath81 could be set to @xmath114 such that @xmath115 the dissimilarity between object @xmath25 and cluster @xmath72 , @xmath116 , is a function of @xmath117 , which is the potential prototype of class @xmath83 .",
    "the bbas of the objects class assignment are updated identically to ecm @xcite , but it is worth noting that @xmath116 has different meanings as that in ecm although in both cases it measures the dissimilarity between object @xmath25 and class @xmath72 . in ecm @xmath116",
    "is the distance between object @xmath118 and the centroid point of @xmath72 , while in ecmdd , it is the dissimilarity between @xmath25 and the most  possible \" medoid . for the prototype updating process",
    "the fact that the prototypes are assumed to be one of the data objects is taken into consideration .",
    "therefore , when the credal partition matrix @xmath77 is fixed , the new prototype of each cluster can be obtained in a simpler manner than in the case of ecm application . the ecmdd algorithm is summarized as algorithm [ alg : method ] .",
    "we discuss here about the convergence of ecmdd .",
    "the assignment update process will not increase @xmath76 since the new mass matrix is determined by differentiating of the respective lagrangian of the cost function with respect to @xmath77 .",
    "also @xmath76 will not increase through the medoid - searching scheme for prototypes of specific classes .",
    "if the prototypes of specific classes are fixed , the medoids of imprecise classes determined by eq .",
    "are likely to locate near to the  centroid \" of all the prototypes of the included specific classes",
    ". if the objects are in euclidean space , the medoids of imprecise classes are near to the centroids found in ecm .",
    "thus it will not increase the value of the objective function also .",
    "moreover , the bba @xmath77 is a function of the prototypes @xmath78 and for given @xmath78 the assignment @xmath77 is unique . because ecmdd assumes that the prototypes are original object data in @xmath61 , so there is a finite number of different prototype vectors @xmath78 and so is the number of corresponding credal partitions @xmath77 .",
    "consequently we can conclude that the ecmdd algorithm converges in a finite number of steps .      as in ecm , before running ecmdd",
    ", the values of the parameters have to be set .",
    "parameters @xmath119 and @xmath37 have the same meanings as those in ecm .",
    "the value @xmath36 can be set to be @xmath120 in all experiments for which it is a usual choice .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 aims to penalize the subsets with high cardinality and control the amount of points assigned to imprecise clusters for credal partitions .",
    "the higher @xmath35 is , the less mass belief is assigned to the meta clusters and the less imprecise will be the resulting partition .",
    "however , the decrease of imprecision may result in high risk of errors .",
    "for instance , in the case of hard partitions , the clustering results are completely precise but there is much more intendancy to partition an object to an unrelated group . as suggested in @xcite , a value can be used as a starting default one but it can be modified according to what is expected from the user .",
    "the choice @xmath37 is more difficult and is strongly data dependent @xcite . in ecmdd",
    ", parameter @xmath101 weighs the contribution of uncertainty to the dissimilarity between objects and imprecise clusters .",
    "parameter @xmath121 is used to distinguish the outliers from the possible medoids when determining the prototypes of meta classes .",
    "it could be set 1 by default and it has little effect on the final partition results .    for determining the number of clusters , the validity index of a credal partition defined by @xcite could be utilised : @xmath122 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 .",
    "this index has to be minimized to get the optimal number of clusters .",
    "in this section some experiments on various data sets will be performed to show the effectiveness of ecmdd .",
    "the results are compared with fcmdd and mecm to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method .",
    "the @xmath1-means type clustering algorithms are sensitive to the initial prototypes . in this work ,",
    "we follow the initialization procedure as the one used in @xcite and @xcite to generate a set of @xmath1 initial prototypes one by one .",
    "the first medoid , @xmath124 , is randomly picked from the data set . the rest of medoids are selected successively one by one in such a way that each one is most dissimilar to all the medoids that have already been picked .",
    "suppose @xmath125 is the set of the first chosen @xmath66 ( @xmath126 ) medoids .",
    "then the @xmath127 medoid , @xmath128 , is set to the object @xmath129 with @xmath130 this selection process makes the initial prototypes evenly distributed and locate as far away from each other as possible .",
    "the popular measures , precision ( p ) , recall ( r ) and rand index ( ri ) , which are typically used to evaluate the performance of hard clusterings are also used here .",
    "precision is the fraction of relevant instances ( pairs in identical groups in the clustering benchmark ) out of those retrieved instances ( pairs in identical groups of the discovered clusters ) , while recall is the fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved .",
    "then precision and recall can be calculated by @xmath131 respectively , where @xmath98 ( respectively , @xmath99 ) be the number of pairs of objects simultaneously assigned to identical classes ( respectively , different classes ) by the stand reference partition and the obtained one .",
    "similarly , values @xmath1 and @xmath132 are the numbers of dissimilar pairs partitioned into the same cluster , and the number of similar object pairs clustered into different clusters respectively .",
    "the rand index measures the percentage of correct decisions and it can be defined as @xmath133 where @xmath56 is the number of data objects .    for fuzzy and evidential clusterings , objects may be partitioned into multiple clusters with different degrees . in such cases precision",
    "would be consequently low @xcite .",
    "usually the fuzzy and evidential clusters are made crisp before calculating the measures , using for instance the maximum membership criterion @xcite and pignistic probabilities @xcite .",
    "thus in this work we will harden the fuzzy and credal clusters by maximizing the corresponding membership and pignistic probabilities and calculate precision , recall and ri for each case .",
    "the introduced imprecise clusters can avoid the risk to group a data into a specific class without strong belief .",
    "in other words , a data pair can be clustered into the same specific group only when we are quite confident and thus the misclassification rate will be reduced . however , partitioning too many data into imprecise clusters may cause that many objects are not identified for their precise groups . in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in these aspects , we use the indices for evaluating credal partitions , evidential precision ( ep ) , evidential recall ( er ) and evidential rank index ( eri ) @xcite defined as : @xmath134 in eq .",
    ", the notation @xmath135 denotes the number of pairs partitioned into the same specific group by evidential clusterings , and @xmath136 is the number of relevant instance pairs out of these specifically clustered pairs .",
    "the value @xmath137 denotes the number of pairs in the same group of the clustering benchmark , and er is the fraction of specifically retrieved instances ( grouped into an identical specific cluster ) out of these relevant pairs .",
    "value @xmath138 ( respectively , @xmath139 ) is the number of pairs of objects simultaneously clustered to the same specific class ( _ i.e. _ , singleton class , respectively , different classes ) by the stand reference partition and the obtained credal one .",
    "when the partition degrades to a crisp one , ep , er and eri equal to the classical precision , recall and rand index measures respectively .",
    "ep and er reflect the accuracy of the credal partition from different points of view , but we could not evaluate the clusterings from one single term .",
    "for example , if all the objects are partitioned into imprecise clusters except two relevant data object grouped into a specific class , @xmath140 in this case .",
    "but we could not say this is a good partition since it does not provide us with any information of great value . in this case @xmath141 .",
    "thus er could be used to express the efficiency of the method for providing valuable partitions .",
    "eri is like the combination of ep and er describing the accuracy of the clustering results .",
    "note that for evidential clusterings , precision , recall and ri measures are calculated after the corresponding hard partitions are got , while ep , er and eri are based on hard credal partitions @xcite .",
    "graph visualization is commonly used to visually model relations in many areas . for graphs such as social networks ,",
    "the prototype of one group is likely to be one of the persons ( _ i.e. , _ nodes in the graph ) playing the leader role in the community .",
    "moreover , a graph ( network ) of vertices and edges usually describes the interactions between different agents of the complex system and the pair - wise relationships between nodes are often implied in the graph data sets .",
    "thus medoids - based relational clustering algorithms could be directly applied . in this section",
    "we will evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods applied on community detection problems . here",
    "we test on a widely used benchmark in detecting community structures ,  karate club \" , studied by wayne zachary .",
    "the network consists of 34 nodes and 78 edges representing the friendship among the members of the club ( see figure [ karate].a ) .",
    "there are many similarity and dissimilarity indices for networks , using local or global information of graph structure . in this experiment ,",
    "different similarity metrics will be compared first .",
    "the similarity indices considered here are listed in table [ indices ] .",
    "it is notable that the similarities by these measures are from 0 to 1 , thus they could be converted into dissimilarities simply by @xmath142 .",
    "the comparison results for different dissimilarity indices by fcmdd and ecmdd are shown in table [ comindicesfcmdd ] and table [ comindicesecmdd ] respectively .",
    "as we can see , for all the dissimilarity indices , for ecmdd , the value of evidential precision is higher than that of precision .",
    "this can be attributed to the introduced imprecise classes which enable us not to make a hard decision for the nodes that we are uncertain and consequently guarantee the accuracy of the specific clustering results . from the table we can also see that the performance using the dissimilarity measure based on signal prorogation is better than those using local similarities in the application of both fcmdd and ecmdd .",
    "this reflects that global dissimilarity metric is better than the local ones for community detection .",
    "thus in the following experiments , we only consider the signal dissimilarity index .",
    ".different local and global similarity indices . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ countriestable ]    the results of fcmdd and ecmdd are given in table [ coufcmdd ] and table [ couecmdd ] respectively .",
    "it can be seen that fcmdd is very sensitive to initializations . when the initial prototypes are well set ( the case of @xmath143 )",
    ", the obtained partition is reasonable .",
    "however , the clustering results become worse when the initial medoids are not ideal ( the case of @xmath144 ) .",
    "in fact two of the three medoids are not changed during the update process of fcmdd when using initial prototype set @xmath144 .",
    "this example illustrates that fcmdd is quite easy to be stuck in a local minimum . for ecmdd ,",
    "the credal partitions are the same with different initializations .",
    "the pignistic probabilities are also displayed in table [ couecmdd ] , which could be regarded as membership values in fuzzy partitions .",
    "the country egypt is clustered into imprecise class \\{1 , 2 } , which indicating that egypt is not so well belongs to developing or western alone , but belongs to both categories .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact shown from the dissimilarity matrix : egypt is similar to both usa and india , but has the largest dissimilarity to china . from this experiment",
    "we could conclude that ecmdd is more robust to the initializations than fcmdd .",
