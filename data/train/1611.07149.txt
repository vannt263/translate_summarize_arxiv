    "the radiation from agns is believed to be powered by accreting the surrounding matter onto the supermassive black hole .",
    "observations indicate that different types of agns may have different accretion modes . for the low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) , roughly @xmath5 , due to the low radiative efficiency ,",
    "the radiation is generally believed to be dominated by a faint , radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ; e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ; quataert et al .",

    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of luminous agns can be characterized by different components : a ` big blue bump ' in optical - to - ultraviolet ( uv ) band , which is often explained by a geometrically thin , optically thick , accretion disk extending down to the innermost stable circular orbits ( isco ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; shields 1978 ; malkan & sargent 1982 ; elvis et al .",

    "the formation of coronas in agns is still unclear .",
    "previous works have revealed that a corona can be fed by the evaporation of matter from an underlying cool disk ( e.g. , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ; meyer et al .",

    "if the mass accretion rate transferred from the outermost region of the disk is less than a predictive critical mass accretion rate @xmath13 , the disk will be truncated at a radius from the black hole . however ,",
    "if the mass accretion rate transferred from the outmost region of the disk is greater than @xmath14 , the disk can not be completely evaporated into the corona and extends down to the isco of the black hole . in this model ,",
    "generally , the corona is presumed to be heated by the viscous heating of the corona itself .",
    "meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "( 2012 ) studied the strength of the corona for strong mass flow in the disk and found that the strong compton cooling of the corona by the soft photons from the disk makes the corona quickly condense onto the disk .",
    "for a typical mass accretion rate of @xmath15 transferred from the mostouter region of the disk , the accretion rate in the corona fed by disk evaporation is very low , i.e. , less than @xmath16 , which is inconsistent with the observed strong x - ray emission in most of the luminous agns .    in order to resolve the energy - deficiency problem , liu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) set the ratio ( @xmath2 ) of the corona heating to the total gravitational energy to be a free parameter and found that a relatively large value of @xmath2 is needed for luminous agns .",
    "the more energy is released in the corona , i.e. , the larger @xmath2 , the harder the x - ray emits from the corona . for the corona heating ,",
    "one of the possible mechanisms might be magnetic reconnection .",
    "the magnetic field is generated by dynamo action in the accretion disk . due to the buoyancy instability",
    ", the magnetic flux loop emerges from the disk and reconnects with other loops in the corona , thereby releasing the magnetic energy to heat the coronal plasma .",

    "liu et al . ( 2002a , 2003 ) constructed a disk - corona model with the corona heated by the magnetic reconnection and calculated the corresponding emergent spectra .",
    "the magnetic field strength is characterized by a parameter @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 , i.e. , the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure at the midplane of the disk ) . in their work ,",
    "the disk is divided into two types , i.e. , the gas - pressure - dominated case and radiation - pressure - dominated case .",
    "they found two types of solutions corresponding to hard spectrum and soft spectrum . in the hard - spectrum solution ,",
    "the energy fraction @xmath2 is nearly @xmath19 , and the hard x - ray spectrum index with @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) does not change with mass accretion rate . while , in the soft - spectrum solution , the energy fraction @xmath2 is nearly @xmath22 , implying that the x - ray emission is also nearly @xmath22 .",
    "these two solutions only correspond to the two end points in the observed relation of the hard x - ray spectrum becoming softer at higher accretion rate in luminous agns .",
    "even though there are composed solutions for moderate - luminosity , e.g. , @xmath23 shown in the right panel of fig.1 in liu et al.(2003 ) , the thin disk abruptly changes from being radiation pressure dominated to being gas pressure dominated at a radius , and the energy fraction also directly increases to 1 from 0 .",
    "the distribution of the parameters in the corona , such as electron temperature , density , and the optical depth , are not continuous . however , the observed hard x - ray spectrum is softer at higher accretion rate , which means that the energy fraction smoothly decreases with the accretion rate .",
    "obviously , the previous model can not smoothly reproduce the observed fraction of the x - ray luminosity to the bolometric luminosity .    in the present work , in order to obtain a more self - consistent solution , we improve the model in liu et al.(2002b , 2003 ) and investigate the effect of magnetic field on the structure and spectrum of such a disk - corona model .",
    "the disk is not divided into two types , and the magnetic pressure is assumed to be proportional to the sum of gas pressure and radiation pressure as characterized by magnetic parameter @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) . besides , both the intrinsic disk radiation and the backward corona compton emission are always included for the corona compton cooling .",
    "these improvements will help us to investigate the properties of the accretion flows when it is not clear whether the radiation pressure or gas pressure dominates in the disk .",
    "these are crucial for smoothly changing of the energy fraction from 0 to 1 and predicting the observed hard x - ray emission in luminous agns . in order to constrain the magnetic field for certain viscous coefficient @xmath25",
    ", we calculate the emergent spectrum of the model for different @xmath0 and compare the derived relation between hard x - ray bolometric correction and accretion rate with the observed relation in a sample of luminous agns .",
    "we suggest that the spectrum of the model with @xmath26 for viscous coefficient @xmath3 is consistent with the observed result .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : the model is presented in section 2 .",
    "the numerical results for the structure and the emergent spectrum of the model are in section 3 .",
    "the discussion and the conclusion are in section 4 and section 5 respectively .",
    "we adopt a geometrically thin and optically thick disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . the gravitational power dissipated in an accretion disk through a viscous process per unit surface area",

    "the equation of state of the accretion disk is @xmath29 where magnetic pressure @xmath30 is characterized by the magnetic parameter @xmath0 , i.e. , the ratio of the sum of gas pressure and radiation pressure to magnetic pressure .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is continually generated in the disk by dynamo action . because of the buoyancy instability , the magnetic flux loops can emerge into the corona and reconnect with other loops . in this process , a fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the gravitational energy stored in the magnetic field is transferred into the corona , i.e. , @xmath31 where alfvn speed @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the number density of electrons in the corona . here",
    ", we take the mean molecular weight @xmath34 to be 0.5 , which is case of the chemical composition of pure hydrogen .",
    "as shown in former works , the energy equilibrium of the disk is determined by the accretion energy released in the disk and irradiation by the corona ( haardt & maraschi 1991 , 1993 , cao 2009 ) . in our present work , it is assumed that some parts of the seed photons from the disk are upward scattered as the emergent spectrum , and parts of them are scattered backward .",
    "the backward photons are reprocessed in the disk surface layer and emitted as blackbody .",
    "this means that the irradiation by the corona can only affect the disk blackbody temperature rather than the internal structure of the disk ( tuchman et al .",
    "1990 ; liu et al .",
    "thus , the energy equation for the cold disk is , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the optical depth in the vertical direction of the disk . the height of the disk is @xmath37 .",
    "the opacity @xmath38 is contributed by the scattering opacity @xmath39 and free - free opacity @xmath40 .",
    "we take @xmath41 for the chemical composition of pure hydrogen and @xmath42 .    a fraction ( @xmath2 ) of angular momentum",
    "is carried into the corona along the magnetic loops , and the remaining fraction ( @xmath43 ) of it is maintained in the disk , which is shown in the following equation : @xmath44(1-f)=4\\pi h_{\\rm d}\\tau_{\\rm r\\varphi } , \\label{angular momentum}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the viscosity stress .",
    "the energy transferred from the disk is released in the corona and eventually radiated away mainly via inverse compton scattering .",
    "the density of the corona is determined by the energy balance between the downward thermal conduction and the mass evaporation in the chromospheric layer .",
    "so the energy equations for the corona can be summarized as @xmath46    @xmath47    in equation ( [ corona energy ] ) , the energy density of soft photons is @xmath48 , which includes both the intrinsic disk radiation and the reprocessed radiation of backward compton emission ( with albedo always being assumed to be zero in our calculations ) . in equation([corona energy ] ) , @xmath49 is the effective optical depth , with an initial value of @xmath50 . in our model , we also set @xmath51 as did in previous works ( e.g. , liu et al . 2002b , 2003 ; qiao & liu 2015 ) , since it is found that the emergent spectrum is weakly dependent on @xmath52 .",

    "if no , we set new @xmath68 and @xmath69 and then repeat the structure calculation and monte carlo simulation until the consistent conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 are fulfilled .",
    "given the black hole mass @xmath72 and viscous coefficient @xmath3 as others ( as in , e.g. , king et al .",
    "2013 ) , we numerically solve equations ( [ q_vis])-([e : evap ] ) to obtain the radial structure of the disk corona .",
    "since we aim to investigate the x - ray spectrum properties of luminous agns , the accretion rate @xmath73 in this work .",

    "both the reprocessed corona photons and the intrinsic disk photons are included for the inverse compton scattering .",
    "even though nearly all of the gravitational energy is carried into the corona , the continuous accretion disk absorbs the backward inverse compton emission , and the gas in the chromosphere is efficiently heated , which results in sufficient soft photons for the compton cooling in the corona . while for the clumpy cold gas or the condensation model",
    ", the weak disk only contributes a few soft photons to cool the corona , which in turn leads to harder x - ray spectrum .",
    "the jet is a very common feature in agns .",
    "however , the formation of jets is still a debated issue .",
    "ballantyne ( 2007 ) investigated the accretion geometry of the radio - loud agns and suggested that there are three conditions affecting the jet launching : `` a rapidly spinning black hole , an accretion flow with a large `` h / r '' ratio , and a favorable magnetic field geometry '' . in recent years",
    ", the observational work on the correlation index @xmath138 between the radio - luminosity @xmath139 and hard x - ray luminosity @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) has provided more clues on the relation between the jet and the accretion flows ( merloni et al .",
    "2003 ; falcke et al .",
    "2004 ; wu et al .",
    "it is found that the formation of a jet is related to the hot plasma in the vicinity of the black hole , in the form of either adaf at low accretion rates or a disk corona at high accretion rates ( e.g. , yuan et al .",

    "these hot accretion flows are always geometrically thick with @xmath142 . in our model , since the detailed configuration of the magnetic field is not clear , we neglect the jet / outflow escaping from the corona .",
    "if a rapidly spinning black hole exists in the center , we can suspect that this magnetic - energy - sustained corona might help in launching the jet in luminous agns .",
    "the jet formation may also help reduce the downward reprocessing in the cool disk , which will also affect the x - ray emission of the corona .",
    "this issue will be studied in the future work .",
    "we revisit the structure and the emergent spectrum of a disk corona heated by the reconnection of magnetic field generated in the disk by dynamo action and emerges into the corona .",
    "we studied the effect of the magnetic field on the structure and spectrum of the model with various @xmath0 for @xmath117 .",
    "it is found that the thin disk changes from being radiation pressure dominated to being gas pressure dominated as the magnetic field increases , which smoothly join the two types of solutions together in liu et al .",
    "( 2002b , 2003 ) .",
    "we find that the energy fraction gradually decreases from 0.95 to 0.3 when the accretion rate increases from 0.03 to 0.5 for @xmath143 .",
    "correspondingly , the hard x - ray spectrum becomes softer at higher accretion rate , which is consistent with the observed results .",
    "however , the disk is dominated by the radiation pressure , and the corona is still energy inadequate for the hard x - ray emission with @xmath144 . for @xmath145 , the disk is absolutely dominated by gas pressure and the energy fraction @xmath146 .",
    "the spectrum hardly changes with accretion rate , which is the same as the hard spectrum found in liu et al.(2003 ) .",

    "<S> liu et al . investigated the spectrum of the corona heated by the reconnection of the magnetic field generated by dynamo action in the thin disk and emerging into the corona as a result of buoyancy instability . in the present paper , we improve this model to interpret the observed relation of the hard x - ray spectrum becoming softer at higher accretion rate in luminous agns . the magnetic field is characterized by @xmath0 , i.e. , the ratio of the sum of gas pressure and radiation pressure to magnetic pressure in the disk ( @xmath1 ) . besides , both the intrinsic disk photons and reprocessed photons by the disk are included as the seed photons for inverse compton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> these improvements are crucial for investigating the effect of magnetic field on the accretion disk - corona when it is not clear whether the radiation pressure or gas pressure dominates in thin disk . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the energy fraction released in the corona ( @xmath2 ) gradually increases with the decrease of @xmath0 for the same accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 decreases to less than 50 , the structure and spectrum of the disk - corona is independent on accretion rate , which is similar to the hard spectrum found in liu et al.(2003 ) . comparing with the observational results of the hard x - ray bolometric correction factor in a sample of luminous agns , we suggest that the value of @xmath0 is about 100 - 200 for @xmath3 and the energy fraction @xmath2 should be larger than @xmath4 for hard x - ray emission . </S>"
