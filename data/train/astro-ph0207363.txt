    "many massive binary systems are known , and almost all present high - energy fluxes , not originated in the stars , but around them , indicating the presence of colliding winds .",
    "the source of observed x - rays high fluxes should be a hot and dense gas , generated by shocks around these objects ( zhekov & skinner 2000 ) . at high temperature and density , free - free emission in x - rays becomes highly important ( usov 1992 ; ishibashi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "x - ray emissions associated with interacting winds were observed on many objects ( corcoran et al .",
    "2001 ; thaller et al . 2001 ) .",
    "grains also may be formed and grow on post - shocked gases ( monnier , tuthill , & danchi 2001 ) when the heated gas loses high amount of energy , mainly by _ bremsstrahlung _ , cools and becomes denser .",
    "recent observations in ir supply this idea , showing episodic dust formation events in these regions ( marchenko , moffat , & grosdidier 1999 ; harries , babler , & fox 2000 ) .",
    "some binary systems present , periodically , a sudden decrease of x - ray emission ( ishibashi et al .",
    "a fast dust formation and growth event in these regions due to the shocked winds might provoke a considerable increase in extinction explaining these features of the light curves .",
    "this could cause the temporary reduction on x - rays and uv fluxes , which may increase _ a posteriori _ with the evaporation of the particles , or even by the expansion of the dust shell .",
    "the model assumes the colliding winds of two massive stars a and b , which have mass loss rates @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and wind velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , orbiting each other with period @xmath5 , eccentricity @xmath6 and distance @xmath7 at _ periastron_. we divide the shock evolution in four parts : i ) the instantaneous collision , neglecting radiative losses , ii ) the gas cooling at post - shock , iii ) the formation of dust and its growth and iv ) the evolution of the dust shell , and its consequence to the light curve observed . the basic physics of the shock is very well known , and described by the hydrodynamics equations of : mass continuity , fluid momentum and energy .",
    "the growth and evaporation rates of the dust particles are given by the classic nucleation theory .",
    "@xmath0car is a super massive star , supposed to be a lbv class star , and also is supposed to have a companion , probably another massive wr or ob star ( damineli et al .",
    "the system total mass , inferred by luminosity is @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is responsible for major of this mass and @xmath10 should have typical wr stellar winds , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "observations indicate that @xmath9 should have @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( hillier 2001 ; damineli et al . 2000 ) . for the above parameters and @xmath15 and @xmath16 , it was possible to reproduce its observed light curve .",
    "in this work we present a model for colliding winds where we determined the changes in physical parameters , like density , temperature and pressure in the post - shock .",
    "this gas , cooled and denser after shock , can be the site for grains formation .",
    "the model was applied to @xmath17 which could explain : i- ) the rapid decline on fluxes observed periodically ; and ii- ) the slightly decrease in opacity considering the expansion of the dust with the wind .",
    "this model agrees better with observations for @xmath16 , and a mass loss rate of the primary star of @xmath18 .",
