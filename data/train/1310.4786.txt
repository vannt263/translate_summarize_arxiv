    "dipsc ( hd217352 ) is a rapidly rotating ( @xmath0 days ) single k - giant , a new candidate for the small group of li - rich k - giant stars .",
    "the extreme li - abundance is related to a short evolutionary episode , the helium flash , when different ( partly unknown ) processes activate li - production and propagation ( * ? ? ? * ( charbonnel & balachandran 2000 ) ) . moreover ,",
    "the role of rotation and magnetic activity in these processes is also unclear .",
    "surface li - abundance and the position of dipsc on the hrd was determined in our recent doppler imaging study ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kvri et al .",
    "2013 ) ) . in this paper",
    "we aim to investigate the time evolution of the surface by doppler imaging , as well as the li - distribution on the surface .",
    "15 time series spectra of exceptionally high signal - to - noise ratio were taken with + narval@tbl in nov - dec 2012 , covering 40 days ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) .",

    "combined ( fe+ca+li ) images , as well as their cross - correlation is plotted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the best fit correlation pattern suggests antisolar - type surface differential rotation with a shear of @xmath2 .",
    "this result should be regarded as a preliminary one , since unexpected rearrangements in spot configuration ( e.g. , emerging new flux ) can disturb seriously the pure differential rotation pattern , thus yielding false observation .",
    "we note , however , that antisolar - type differential rotation was reported also for dpcvn , which is another li - rich k - giant , the twin of dipsc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( kvri et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "high li - abundance might be related to strong meridional circulation ( i.e. , extra mixing ) , which , on the other hand , can eventuate antisolar - type differential rotation ( cf .",
    "* kitchatinov & rdiger 2004 ) ) .",
    "non - uniform surface li - abundance would affect the doppler maps by altering the strength of the local line profiles ( the temperature inversion code assumes constant abundance , therefore a higher li equivalent width is fitted with a lower temperature causing a false cool spot on the map ) . in order to investigate this behaviour",
    "we subtract the li - maps from the combined ( fe+ca+li ) ones .",
    "the resulting difference maps are plotted in fig.[fig2 ] top , where signs of similar non - uniformity can be marked in both rotation cycles .",
    "this is supported by the longitudinal distribution of the mean latitudinal temperature values , as well as by the rotational modulation of the lii-6708 equivalent width ( middle and bottom panels of fig.[fig2 ] , respectively ) .",
