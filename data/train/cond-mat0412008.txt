    "the survival probability @xmath9 that a stochastic process @xmath10 does not cross zero upto time @xmath11 is a quantity of long standing interest in probability theory and with many practical applications@xcite .",
    "the derivative @xmath12 is called the first - passage probability@xcite .",
    "this subject has seen a resurgent interest over the last decade in the context of many body nonequilibrium systems where the stochastic process @xmath10 denotes a local time dependent field in a spatially extended evolving system .",
    "for example , in the case of the ising model evolving under the glauber dynamics , the relevant stochastic process @xmath10 is the spin @xmath13 at a fixed site @xmath14 as a function of time @xmath11 and @xmath9 then denotes the probability that the spin @xmath15 does not flip upto time @xmath11@xcite . in this context",
    ", the survival probability @xmath9 thus measures the ` persistence ' of a local field to remain in its initial state .",
    "in many of these nonequilibrium systems , the persistence has been found to decay as a power law at late times , @xmath16 .",
    "the exponent @xmath17 is called the persistence exponent and has been a subject of much theoretical , numerical and experimental studies in recent times@xcite . the exponent",
    "@xmath17 is very hard to calculate analytically even in simple systems such as the linear diffusion equation starting from random initial conditions@xcite .",
    "the reason for this difficulty can be traced back to the fact that the spatial interactions in these extended systems makes the local stochastic field @xmath10 a ` non - markovian ' process in time@xcite .",
    "apart from these pure systems , persistence has also been studied in systems with quenched disorder@xcite . in presence of disorder ,",
    "the exact calculation of persistence @xmath9 is nontrivial even for a single particle without any spatial interaction , though some analytical results have been obtained recently .",
    "for example , the asymptotic results for the persistence of a particle moving in a random sinai potential in one dimension have been obtained both in the case of a vanishing external field@xcite and also for nonzero external field@xcite .",
    "another solvable example is the persistence of a single particle advected by a layered random velocity field@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present analytical results for the persistence @xmath9 in a system with both spatial interaction and disorder .",
    "our system consists of two growing @xmath18-dimensional interfaces where @xmath2 refers to the dimension of the substrate on which the surfaces grow and @xmath19 refers to the time @xmath11 .",
    "the two interfaces are characterized by their heights @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . in our model , while the height @xmath0 of the first interface evolves independently of @xmath1 , the evolution of @xmath1 is driven by a velocity that is a random quenched function of @xmath0 .",
    "this random velocity represents the disorder in the system .",
    "the model is detailed in section ii .",
    "there are two motivations for studying this model :    \\(i ) we will show later in section iii that our model corresponds to different well known physical systems for different values of the spatial dimension @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in the limit @xmath3 , our model reduces to the matheron - de marsily model where one studies the motion of a single brownian particle in a @xmath22-dimensional plane in presence of a transverse random velocity field@xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath4",
    ", we will show that our model describes the evolution of a rouse polymer chain@xcite ( a rouse chain consists of a set of beads or monomers connected by harmonic springs ) moving in a @xmath22-dimensional plane and advected by a transverse random velocity field .",
    "while the transport properties in this latter model are well understood@xcite , the persistence properties have not been studied before .",
    "the analytical results obtained in this paper for the persistence in our model for general @xmath2 will apply to these models in the limiting cases @xmath23 and @xmath4 .",
    "\\(ii ) the persistence properties of a single interface have been studied extensively both theoretically@xcite and more recently they have been measured experimentally in a system of fluctuating steps on crystal surfaces@xcite . in the experimental system , there are many step edges , each corresponding to a single interface . if the step edges are sufficiently separated from each other , they can be considered as independently growing interfaces . however , in general , there will always be an interaction , albeit weak , between two step edges and their motions will be coupled .",
    "hence it is important to study persistence in models where the interface heights are coupled .",
    "motivated by this observation , we study here the persistence in a simple model of coupled interfaces .",
    "while this model , by no means , is a true representative of the actual experimental situation , the advantage is that it represents a minimal model with coupling for which one can calculate the persistence properties analytically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the model precisely and state our main results . in section iii",
    "we consider the two limiting cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 where our model reduces to two well known models . in section",
    "iv we point out our strategy to compute the persistence exponents analytically . in section v , we map the relevant stochastic process into a fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) and then using a well known first - passage property of fbm , we calculate the persistence exponents analytically .",
