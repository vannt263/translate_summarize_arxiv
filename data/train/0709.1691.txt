    "superconducting materials , because of their low surface resistance , are recommended for manufacturing many passive _ mw _ devices  @xcite . among the various devices ,",
    "the superconducting resonant cavity is one of the most important application in the systems requiring high selectivity in the signal frequency , such as filters for communication systems @xcite , particle accelerators @xcite , equipment for material characterization at _ mw _ frequencies @xcite .    since the discovery of the high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) ,",
    "several attempts have been done to assemble _ mw _ cavities made of bulk hts  @xcite ; however , limitations in their performance were encountered .",
    "firstly , grain boundaries in these materials are weakly coupled giving rise to reduction of the critical current and/or nonlinear effects , which worsen the device performance  @xcite ; furthermore , the process necessary to obtain bulk hts in a performing textured form is very elaborated . for these reasons , in several applications , most of the superconducting cavities are still manufactured with nb , requiring liquid he as refrigerator @xcite .    since the discovery of superconductivity at 39  k in mgb@xmath0  @xcite",
    ", several authors have indicated this material as promising for technological applications  @xcite .",
    "the advantages of using mgb@xmath0 for this purpose are several .",
    "the simple chemical composition makes the synthesis process easy , reducing the production cost in comparison with hts .",
    "the relatively high critical temperature allows to maintain the compound in the superconducting state by using modern closed - cycle cryocoolers , not requiring liquid he as thermal bath .",
    "a further interesting property of mgb@xmath0  bulk samples is the high connectivity of the superconducting grains .",
    "indeed , contrary to oxide hts , bulk mgb@xmath0can be used in the polycrystalline form without a significant degradation of its critical current @xcite .",
    "this property has been ascribed to the large coherence length , which makes the material less susceptible to structural defects like grain boundaries  @xcite . due to these amazing properties ,",
    "mgb@xmath0 has been recommended for manufacturing _ mw _ cavities  @xcite , and investigation is carried out to test the potential of different mgb@xmath0 materials for this purpose .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the _ mw _ properties of the first cylindrical cavity made of bulk mgb@xmath0",
    "the material has been produced by the reactive liquid mg infiltration technology  @xcite ; it exhibits a critical temperature @xmath5  k. the frequency response of the cavity has been measured in the range @xmath1  ghz .",
    "the quality factor of the cavity for the te@xmath2 mode has been investigated as a function of the temperature , from @xmath6  k up to @xmath7  k. from the @xmath8 values , we have determined the temperature dependence of the _ mw _ surface resistance of the mgb@xmath0  material ; these results have been compared with those independently obtained in a small plate - like sample of mgb@xmath0extracted from the same specimen used for the cavity .",
    "as it is well known , an important valuation index to determine the performance of a resonant cavity is the quality factor @xmath8 , defined as @xmath9 in an empty resonant cavity , essentially two causes contribute to the energy losses : conductor losses , associated to the conduction currents in the cavity walls ; radiation losses , due to power that leaves the cavity through the holes for the coupling between the resonator and the external circuit .",
    "therefore , the overall or loaded @xmath8 , denoted by @xmath10 , can be defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is due to the radiative losses and @xmath13 , the so - called unloaded @xmath8 , includes only the conductor losses .",
    "+ @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the surface resistance of the material ; @xmath16 is the geometry factor , it depends on the shape and dimensions of the cavity and the specific resonant mode .    for a cavity coupled to the external circuit through two lines ,",
    "@xmath13 can be deduced , from the measured @xmath10 , by taking into account the coupling coefficients , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for both the coupling lines ; these coefficients can be calculated by directly measuring the reflected power at each line , as described in chap .",
    "iv of ref .",
    "thus , @xmath13 can be calculated as @xmath19 it is worth noting that @xmath12 can be made large by weakly coupling the excitation and detection lines . in this case ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "as it is well known , resonant cylindrical cavities can support both te@xmath22 and tm@xmath22 modes ; the subscripts _",
    "l _ , _ m _ and _ n _ refer to the number of half - wavelength variations in the standing - wave pattern in @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions , respectively .",
    "the resonant frequencies of a cylindrical cavity resonating in the te@xmath22 or tm@xmath22 modes are given by  @xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the permeability and dielectric constant of the medium filling the cavity ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 the radius and length of the cavity ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the _ _",
    "m__th zeros of the bessel function of order _",
    "l _ and of its first derivative , respectively .    among the various resonant modes ,",
    "the ones more extensively used are the te@xmath34 , which give a reasonably high quality factor . in the te@xmath34 modes ,",
    "the wall currents are purely circumferential and no currents flow between the end plates and the cylinder .",
    "this implies that no electrical contact between plates and cylinder is required , making the cavity assembly easy .",
    "the te@xmath34 modes are degenerate in frequency with the tm@xmath35 modes and this should be avoided to have a well defined field configuration ; however , this degeneracy can be removed introducing a small gap between cylinder and lids .",
    "this shifts the resonant frequency of the tm@xmath35 modes downwards , leaving the te@xmath34 modes nearly unperturbed .",
    "the unloaded quality factor of a cylindrical cavity resonating in the te@xmath34 mode is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37^{3/2}}{2(z_{01}^{\\prime})^2 d^3 + 4 n^2\\pi^2 a^3}\\,,\\;\\;\\ ; z_{01}^{\\prime } = 3.83170\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "the material from which the cavity is made has been produced by the reactive liquid mgb@xmath0  infiltration technology ( rli )  @xcite .",
    "the rli process consists in the reaction of pure liquid mg and boron powder , sealed in a stainless steel container with a weight ratio mg / b over the stoichiometric value ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the reaction between liquid mg and b powder produces a more stable material , with respect to the hot pressing technique , at temperatures of a few hundred k above the mg melting point and at moderate pressure .",
    "this procedure allows one to obtain specimens of high density and dimensions of the order of tens on centimeters , showing very high mechanical strength  @xcite .    as the first attempt to apply the mgb@xmath0 produced by rli to the cavity - filter technology ,",
    "we have manufactured a simple cylindrical cavity and have investigated its microwave response in a wide range of frequencies .",
    "all the parts of the cavity , cylinder and lids , are made of bulk mgb@xmath0 material with @xmath39  k and density @xmath40 .",
    "the material has been obtained using commercial crystalline b powder ( starck h. c. , germany , 99.5% purity ) and pure mg ; in order to get the b powder to be used in the synthesis process , the original chunks were mechanically crushed and filtered through a 100 micron sieve . in particular , the present cylindrical cavity ( inner diameter 40 mm , outer diameter 48 mm , height 42.5 mm ) was cut by electroerosion from a thicker bulk mgb@xmath0 cylinder , previously prepared as described in sec .  4.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , internally polished to a surface roughness of about 300  nm .    a photograph of the parts , cylinder and lids , composing the superconducting cavity is shown in fig .  [ fig - cavity ] .",
    "the holes in one of the lids have been used to insert two small loop antennas which couple the cavity with the excitation and detection lines .",
    "the loop antenna was constructed on the end of each line , soldering the central conductor to the outer shielding of the semirigid cable . in order to remove the degeneracy between te@xmath34 and tm@xmath35 modes , we have incorporated a  mode trap \" in the form of circular grooves ( 1 mm thick , 2 mm wide ) inside the cylinder at the outer edges .",

    "_ surface resistance of a small plate - like sample of mgb@xmath0  extracted from the same specimen from which the cavity has been obtained .",

    "[ fig : rvst - cavity ] shows a comparison between the @xmath57 values deduced from @xmath58 ( full symbols ) and those obtained in the sample ( open symbols ) .",
    "as one can see , when the cavity is in the superconducting state , the @xmath57 curves obtained by the two different techniques are consistent , while for @xmath59 they differ by @xmath60 .",
    "this disagreement may be ascribed to the difficulty of measuring with high sensitivity the quality factor of the mgb@xmath0  cavity at @xmath59 , due to its small value . on the contrary",

    "[ fig : te - curve]b , the resonant curve for the te@xmath42 mode is not very well described by a lorentzian function ; this problem becomes more significant on increasing the temperature , making inaccurate the determination of the quality factor at temperatures higher that @xmath61  k. for these reason , we have not reported here the temperature dependence of @xmath62 .",
    "however , we have verified that , also for the te@xmath63 mode , the quality factor takes on values of the order of @xmath3 up to @xmath64  k and reduced by a factor of @xmath54 when the material goes to the normal state .",
    "it is well known that one of the most important application of superconducting materials is the implementation of _ mw _ resonant cavities , which can be used in a large variety of devices  @xcite .",
    "although several studies have been devoted to build _ mw _ cavities using hts , actually most of the superconducting cavities are still manufactured with nb , requiring liquid he as refrigerator .",
    "the main problem encountered in using bulk hts , for this purpose , is due to the weak coupling of grain boundaries in these materials , which act as weak links . on the contrary",
    ", it has widely been shown that in bulk mgb@xmath0  samples only a small amount of grain boundaries act as weak links  @xcite , hindering the strong suppression of the critical current with magnetic field and the generation of nonlinear effects at high input power .",
    "for these reasons , as well as for the relatively high @xmath65 , several authors have recommended mgb@xmath0  as a convenient material to build _ mw _ cavity .",
    "recently , we have investigated the _",
    "mw _ response of small plate - like samples of mgb@xmath0 prepared by rli process , in the linear and nonlinear regimes  @xcite .",
    "these studies have highlighted a weak nonlinear response , as well as relatively small values of the residual surface resistance .",
    "in particular , we have found that the _ mw _ properties of such samples improve on decreasing the size of the b powder used in the synthesis process .",
    "furthermore , bulk samples produced by rli maintain the surface staining unchanged for years , without controlled - atmosphere protection .",
    "this useful property is most likely related to the high density , and consequently high grain connectivity , achieved with the rli process , as well as to the small and controlled amount of impurity phases @xcite .",
    "prompted by these interesting results , we have built the _",
    "mw _ resonant cavity using mgb@xmath0 produced by the rli process  @xcite .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : qvst - cavity ] show that @xmath8 takes on values of the order of @xmath3 from @xmath6  k up to @xmath66  k , a temperature easily reachable by modern closed - cycle cryocoolers . to our knowledge ,",
    "these @xmath8 values are higher than those reported in the literature for _ mw _ cylindrical cavities manufactured with hts , both bulk and films @xcite .",
    "so , our results show that mgb@xmath0 produced by rli is a very promising material for building _",
    "mw _ resonant cavities .",
    "we would remark that this is the first attempt to realize a superconducting cavity made of bulk mgb@xmath0 .",
    "in particular , this investigation has been carried out with the aim to explore the potential of bulk mgb@xmath0 materials prepared by rli to the _ mw_-cavity technology .",
    "the mgb@xmath0 material from which the present cavity is made has been obtained using crystalline b powder with grain mean size @xmath67 m .",
    "our previous studies on bulk mgb@xmath0 samples , obtained by the rli method , have shown that samples prepared using microcrystalline b powder ( @xmath68 m in size ) exhibit smaller residual surface resistance ( @xmath69 )  @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : rvst - cavity ] , one can see that the residual surface resistance of the cavity is @xmath70 .",
    "so , we infer that one could improve the quality factor by one order of magnitude manufacturing the cavity with material produced by liquid mg infiltration in micrometric b powder .",
    "because of the shorter length of percolation of the liquid mg into very fine b powder , the production of massive mgb@xmath0 samples by rli using b powder with size @xmath68 m turns out to be more elaborate . however , work is in progress to improve the preparation process in order to manufacture large specimens using microcrystalline b powder . considering that the _ mw _ fields penetrate in a surface layer of the material of the order of the penetration depth , a more performing",
    "_ resonant cavity can be obtained designing a composite structure ; in particular , one can use microcrystalline b powder for the inner part of the cavity and larger grain - size b powder for the outer part .    in conclusion , we have shown that the rli process provides a useful method for assembling high - performance _",
    "_ cavities , which may have large scale application .",
    "we have obtained quality factors of the order of @xmath3 , larger than those reported in the literature for cavities made of hts , both bulk and films , in the same temperature range .",
    "although higher quality factors have been reported for superconducting cavities made of pure nb and nb alloys  @xcite , nb cavities must be kept in liquid - he bath ; on the contrary , cavity made of mgb@xmath0 can be maintained in the superconducting state by using close - cycle cryocoolers that can easily work at temperature of the order of 10  k.",
