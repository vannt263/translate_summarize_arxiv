    "this behavior confirms the proportionality of the electron concentration to the gate voltage in our samples .",
    "the data points appear only at @xmath46  t in low fields in fig .",
    "[ fan ] , because the 2deg mobility decreases strongly at lower 2deg concentrations  @xcite .",
    "the experimental fan chart in fig .",
    "[ fan ] has three peculiarities .",
    "first , it depends only on the normal field component at low tilt angles ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is in good correspondence with results of ref .  , where the influence of the in - plane component was only observed at the highest ( @xmath56 ) tilt angles .",
    "second , there are no data points around @xmath43  t for @xmath1 , demonstrating the absence of the @xmath1 qh state in this region .",
    "third , the data points for @xmath0 deviate from the expected fan line .",
    "they are concentrated along two overlapping branches .",
    "since these data are obtained in the same @xmath31 range as for @xmath1 , the electron density in fact follows the gate bias .",
    "we have to conclude , that the two overlapping branches indicate  @xcite a competition between two qh states at @xmath0 around the critical field @xmath44",
    "t.    landau fan charts only qualitatively reflect the presence of an energy gap at the fermi level at some @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath25 quantum wells are characterized by a long - range in concentration modulation  @xcite .",
    "this results in long - range potential fluctuations in the well , which can also be seen  @xcite from wide minimum / maximum structures in the insets to fig .",
    "for this reason , standard bulk quantitative measurements of the gap  @xcite will give the gap values averaged over the sample plane .",
    "instead , we perform _ local _ measurements of the energy gap at the fermi level at @xmath45 by means of the edge transport .",
    "curves for transport across @xmath57 incompressible stripe at the sample edge .",
    "the evolution of the curves is shown along the @xmath1 fan line in fig .  [ fan ] by approaching @xmath43  t from low @xmath58 ( a ) or high @xmath59 ( b ) magnetic fields .",
    "far from the critical region , @xmath60 curves are strongly non - linear , the significant current appears only above some threshold voltage @xmath61 .",
    "the threshold value @xmath61 characterizes  @xcite the energy gap @xmath62 within the @xmath57 incompressible stripe : @xmath63 .",
    "it tends to zero by approaching @xmath20 , which indicates closing of the energy gap at the fermi level at @xmath20 .",
    "[ iv32 ] ]    the quasi - corbino sample geometry is specially designed for local intra - edge transport investigations within the narrow gate - gap region at the mesa edge  @xcite . in particular , it allows to obtain the energy gap @xmath62 within the incompressible stripe at the sample edge from the analysis of @xmath60 curves  @xcite .    since we know the fan chart in fig .",

    "the fig .",
    "[ sample ] is drawn for both integer filling factors @xmath32 and @xmath0 .",
    "approaching the mesa edge in the gate - gap , the edge potential diminishes the 2deg concentration in a so - called compressible region at the mesa edge  @xcite . since the potential of the etched edge is smooth  @xcite , the local filling factor @xmath67 is diminishing smoothly from the bulk @xmath66 value to zero at the edge  @xcite .",
    "incompressible stripes of finite width are formed  @xcite along the edge near the integer local filling factors @xmath68 , e.g. at @xmath57 and 1 for @xmath69 . in particular , there is an incompressible stripe at @xmath70 .",

    "<S> the observed reconstruction is of different character at these filling factors : it is characterized by zeroing of the energy gap at the levels crossing point at @xmath1 , while the reconstruction at @xmath0 goes through the coexistence of two @xmath0 quantum hall phases with different spin projections . </S>",
