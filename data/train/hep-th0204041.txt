    "notice that our findings are quite model - independent since they depend only upon the total number of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets in the bulk .",
    "some comments are now in order .",
    "the first one refers to radius stabilization .",
    "as one can see from ( [ potencial ] ) the one - loop potential does not stabilize the value of @xmath92 , related to the radion field .",
    "in fact the behaviour is runaway : in particular for @xmath87 , we obtain at the global minimum of the effective potential the asymptotic behaviour @xmath93 .",
    "however we expect the radion to be stabilized by some other mechanism that does not affect the present results .",
    "massive fields in the bulk seem to be required for radion stabilization  @xcite .",
    "the second comment concerns the appearence of a non - vanishing vacuum energy at the minimum of the effective potential of order @xmath94 .",
    "this fact is a generic feature of many models with flat potential , or zero cosmological constant , at the tree - level .",
    "we expect on general grounds that the non - vanishing energy will disturb our original assumption of flat space - time .",
    "we are not computing the back reaction on the space - time metrics but expect its modification to be suppressed as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the planck scale of the higher dimensional theory .",
    "the last comment refers to the quality of the supersymmetry breaking solution @xmath97 we have found .",
    "since all the supersymmetric spectrum depends on the actual value of @xmath11  @xcite the value @xmath97 is very constraining for electroweak symmetry breaking in the different considered models . in the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all matter fields were localized on the branes while higgs and vector multiplets live in the bulk , the case @xmath97 is phenomenologically problematic because the theory does not allow for an @xmath98 higgs mixing and therefore the vev of @xmath99 is zero .",
    "the same happens for the alternative model  @xcite where gauge multiplets and @xmath100 singlets live and the bulk and @xmath100 doublets are localized on the brane .",
    "this problem is however avoided in models with a single higgs hypermultiplet , as those based on @xmath101  @xcite , although these models develop a fayet - iliopoulos quadratic divergence  @xcite .",
    "we have checked as well that in models with @xmath87 the stability of the minimum at @xmath97 is not lifted by two - loop corrections",
    ". then it would be desirable to introduce an extra mechanism that would lead to an effective potential with a minimum at @xmath102 .",
    "since the orbifold @xmath0 has branes at the fixed points , a hidden sector at one of the fixed points ( say at @xmath103 ) can break spontaneously supersymmetry by some brane - localized dynamics , as _",
    "e.g. _ gaugino condensation . in this case",
    "there will be an interplay between the mechanism that we have discussed up to now and the brane dynamics",
    ". this will be the object of study in the next section .",
    "the couplings of the minimal and tensor multiplet to the branes have been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the gauge ( [ gfix ] ) they lead to the total lagrangian , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a constant superpotential left out when some brane fields in the hidden sector are integrated out and @xmath106 where we have fixed the vev of the auxiliary fields that do not play any role in the mass spectrum of @xmath5 doublets .",
    "we are assuming the hidden sector in the brane located at @xmath103 and therefore the observable brane ( where any localized matter fields should be located ) at @xmath107  .",
    "notice that the gauge fixing condition ( [ gfix ] ) breaks @xmath5 in the bulk to the @xmath1 generated by @xmath25 , and to nothing in the branes since only the auxiliary gauge field @xmath108 is even ( see table  [ paritymin ] ) . the bulk @xmath1 will drop out by elimination of the auxiliary field @xmath32 from the @xmath52 field equation ( [ solucion2 ] ) .",
    "however the presence of the brane lagrangian ( [ lagbrana ] ) will provide a brane mass contribution to the 5d gravitino and will alter the field equations of @xmath31 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 with respect to the bulk solution ( [ solucion1 ] ) .",
    "this in turn will modify the spectrum of mass eigenvalues of gauginos and hyperscalars as we will see in this section .",

    "we have checked that these singular terms cancel leading to a zero cosmological constant at the tree - level .",
    "this latter property is expected to be spoiled by radiative corrections as we have discussed in the previous section .",
    "the presence of the gravitino brane mass term in ( [ lagbrana ] ) as well as the non - trivial solution for the field @xmath31 in ( [ solucionb ] ) will alter the mass spectrum for gravitinos , gauginos and hyperscalars , whose mass eigenvalues will departure from the calculated values in ( [ masa32 ] ) and ( [ masa120 ] ) , and need to be recalculated .",
    "the kaluza - klein spectrum of bulk vector multiplets , hyperscalars and gravitinos in the presence of the auxiliary fields @xmath111 and @xmath112 can be computed in different ways .",
