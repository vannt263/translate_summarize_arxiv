    "many papers were published in order to explain the problems raised by the separation , i.e. , the apparent lack of strength in the longitudinal response and the apparent excess of strength in the transverse one . among them , the more recent ones are concerned with the contribution to the inclusive cross section of meson exchange currents and isobar excitations @xcite , with the effect of correlations @xcite , and the use of a relativistic framework in the calculations @xcite .    at present , however , a consistent and simultaneous description of the longitudinal and transverse response functions is not available",

    "a peculiar problem of inclusive electron scattering is the treatment of final state interactions ( fsi ) , since they are essential to explain the exclusive reaction with one - nucleon emission , which is the dominant process contributing to the inclusive reaction in the quasielastic region .",
    "the large absorption due , e.g. , to the imaginary part of the optical potential , produces a loss of flux that is appropriate for the exclusive process , but inconsistent for the inclusive one , where the total flux must be conserved .",
    "this conservation is preserved in the green s function approach considered here .",

    "green s function , based on a biorthogonal expansion in terms of the eigenfunctions of the nonhermitian optical potential , allows one to perform explicit calculations and to treat fsi consistently in the inclusive and in the exclusive reactions . in previous papers @xcite the green s function approach",
    "was used both in a nonrelativistic and in a relativistic framework to perform explicit calculations of the inclusive response functions .",
    "two issues are the main goal of this paper : a completely antisymmetrized presentation of the green s function approach , and the effect of nuclear correlations , which are included in the model through the use of a realistic one - body density matrix ( odm ) . in the previous application of the method",
