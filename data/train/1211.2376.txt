    "the final ingredient is a non - negative function , or _ observable _ , @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 is also easily computable for each @xmath5 .",
    "our goal is to compute the _ average _ of  @xmath14 with respect to  @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 as illustration we present two classical examples , both of which we will develop extensively in our later results .    _",
    "example  1 : the ferromagnetic ising model .",
    "_ here the configurations are assignments of spin values @xmath17 to the vertices of  @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the weight of a configuration  @xmath9 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of _ disagreements _ in  @xmath9 ( i.e. , the number of edges @xmath21 with @xmath22 ) , and @xmath23 is the number of vertices @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the model has two parameters : the _ edge potential _",
    "@xmath26 , satisfying @xmath27 , which governs the strength of the interaction between neighboring spins ; and the _ vertex activity _",
    "@xmath28 , which specifies the tendency for spins to be  @xmath29 .",

    "similarly , the distribution favors ` @xmath29 ' ( respectively , ` @xmath33 ' ) spins when @xmath34 ( respectively , when @xmath35 ) .",
    "an important observable here is the _ magnetization _",
    "@xmath23 , which is just the number of @xmath29-spins in  @xmath9 .",
    "its average , the _",
    "mean magnetization _ , is a fundamental quantity in statistical physics : @xmath36 other widely studied averages include the _ mean energy _",
    "@xmath37 ( the average size of the cut between @xmath29-spins and @xmath33-spins ) and the _ susceptibility _ @xmath38 ( the variance of the magnetization ) .    _",
    "example  2 : matchings , or the monomer - dimer model . _",
    "the configurations  @xmath11 are all matchings ( independent sets of edges ) in  @xmath2 .",
    "the weight of a matching  @xmath9 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of unmatched vertices ( _ monomers _ ) in  @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is the vertex weight ( or _ monomer activity _ ) , while for each edge @xmath41 , @xmath42 is an edge weight ( or _ dimer activity _ ) .",
    "the gibbs distribution @xmath43 is a natural weighted distribution on matchings , and the partition function @xmath44 is the weighted matching polynomial of  @xmath2 .",
    "a natural observable here is @xmath40 , the number of unmatched vertices ( or monomers ) .",
    "note that @xmath45 is just the average size of a ( weighted ) matching in  @xmath2 ( or equivalently , the average number of dimers ) .",
    "observe that the ising model partition function  @xmath46 may be written as a polynomial in  @xmath47 ( actually a bivariate polynomial in  @xmath47 and  @xmath26 ) : @xmath48 the mean magnetization then becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the differential operator @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , the mean energy and susceptibility @xmath52 can be written @xmath53 for matchings , the partition function  @xmath54 is nothing other than the matching polynomial @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a weighted sum over matchings with @xmath3 unmatched vertices .",
    "the average number of monomers is then @xmath57 where @xmath50 again denotes the differential operator @xmath51 .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : magratio])([eq : matchratio ] ) , which express averages as the ratio of some derivative of the partition function to the partition function itself , are in fact no accident ; they are a consequence of the fact that the gibbs distribution takes the form @xmath58 , where the _ hamiltonian _ @xmath59 is a sum of natural observables .",
    "the subject of this paper is the computational complexity of computing natural averages such as ( [ eq : magratio])([eq : matchratio ] ) . while the complexity of computing partition functions has been widely studied in the framework of valiant s class # p of counting problems for details . ]",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we are not aware of any corresponding results for the exact computation of averages . in the approximate",
    "setting , by contrast , it is well known that ( at least for the wide class of self - reducible problems , which includes all the examples above ) approximate computation of the partition function is polynomial time equivalent to sampling ( approximately ) from the gibbs distribution  @xmath15  @xcite ; and sampling from  @xmath15 clearly allows us to approximate averages to any desired accuracy ( this is because the observables one is concerned with in these situations admit _ a priori _ absolute bounds which are polynomial in the input size ) .",
    "what if we are interested in exact computation ?",
    "it is tempting to argue that computing an average as in , say , ( [ eq : magratio ] ) is at least as hard as computing the partition function  @xmath46 , because ( [ eq : magratio ] ) is a rational function and thus by evaluating it at a small number of points we could recover the numerator and denominator polynomials by rational interpolation .",
    "since the partition function is # p - hard for details . ] in almost all cases of interest ( including @xmath46 and @xmath54 above at all but trivial values of the parameters ) , we would be done .",
    "the problem with this argument is that , viewed as polynomials in the variable  @xmath47 , @xmath46 and its derivative @xmath60 may have common factors ( equivalently , viewed as polynomials in the complex variable @xmath47 , they might have common zeros ) ; and in this case we are clearly not able to recover  @xmath46 by rational interpolation .",
    "indeed it seems hard _ a priori _ to rule out the possibility that non - trivial interactions between @xmath46 and its derivative could conspire to make the average much easier to compute than  @xmath46 itself .",
    "thus we are naturally led to the following question :    * question : * _ is it possible for the partition function  @xmath10 and its derivative to have common zeros ? _ and @xmath61 corresponds to a repeated zero of  @xmath10 , so this question is equivalent to the question of whether @xmath10 may have repeated zeros . ]    if the answer is no , then we will be able to conclude that computing the average is as hard as computing  @xmath10 itself , and thus # p - hard in all interesting cases .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to carry through this program using resolutions of the above question in several interesting cases . before proceeding",
    ", we mention a possible alternative approach to deal with the issue of repeated zeros .",
    "since a generic polynomial does not have repeated zeros , one could try to argue that any given graph @xmath2 can be perturbed so that its partition function has distinct zeros , and so that the magnetization of the perturbed graph is close to the magnetization of the original graph .",
    "one could then perform the interpolation operations with respect to the perturbed graph , and hope that if the perturbations are small enough , then the reduction still goes through .",
    "indeed , this is our intuition for why the magnetization ( and other averages ) should be hard to compute .",
    "however , it is not clear how to convert this intuition into a formal proof : in addition to a rather involved error analysis , this would require showing that the partition function of a `` perturbed '' ising model behaves like a generic polynomial with respect to the structure of its zeros , which seems no easier than answering the question above .",
    "our approach sidesteps this issue by tackling the question directly , and in addition establishes a non - trivial property of the zeros of the partition function that may be of independent interest .",
    "the question of common zeros actually turns out to be a deeper issue of wider interest in statistical physics and complex analysis .",
    "the study of the zeros of the partition function dates back to the work of lee and yang in 1952 : the famous _ lee - yang circle theorem _",
    "@xcite proves the remarkable fact that the zeros of the ferromagnetic ising partition function  @xmath46 always lie on the unit circle in the complex plane .",
    "this classical theorem , which has since been re - proved many times in different ways  @xcite , was developed initially as an approach to studying phase transitions , but has since spawned a more global theory connected with the laguerre - plya - schur theory of linear operators preserving stability of polynomials .",
    "( see the related work section below . )",
    "somewhat surprisingly , despite much activity in this area , the question of the location of the zeros of the derivative @xmath60 ( or equivalently , of repeated zeros of  @xmath46 itself ) remains open .",
    "the main technical contribution of this paper is to resolve this question as follows .",
    "[ thm : lee - yang - ext ] let @xmath62 be a connected graph , and suppose @xmath63 . then the zeros of the polynomial @xmath64 ( in @xmath47 ) satisfy @xmath65 .",
    "since the lee - yang theorem says that all zeros of  @xmath46 satisfy @xmath66 , theorem  [ thm : lee - yang - ext ] immediately implies that @xmath46 and @xmath60 have no common zeros .",
    "the restriction that @xmath2 be connected is needed : there exist disconnected graphs for which the conclusion of the theorem does not hold .",
    "a simple example is a graph consisting of two isomorphic disconnected subgraphs .",
    "for the same reason we require @xmath67 .",
    "we also note that standard facts from complex analysis ( in particular , the gauss - lucas theorem ) imply that the zeros of  @xmath60 lie in the convex hull of those of  @xmath46 , and hence within the closed unit circle .",
    "the content of theorem  [ thm : lee - yang - ext ] is that they must lie in the _ interior _ of the circle .",
    "this refinement is of course crucial for our application .    before moving on ,",
    "let us briefly mention our approach to the proof .",
    "we actually prove a more general result concerning the zeros of the multivariate partition function @xmath68 ; see theorem  [ thm : wsglp ] in section  [ sec : an - extended - lee ] .",
    "( the lee - yang theorem itself is also often stated in multivariate form . )",
    "our proof is based on a delightful combinatorial proof of the lee - yang theorem due to asano  @xcite , which begins with the empty graph ( which trivially satisfies the theorem ) and builds the desired graph  @xmath2 by repeatedly adding edges one at a time ; by a careful induction one can show that the lee - yang property is preserved under each edge addition .",
    "our proof follows a similar induction , but the argument is more delicate because we are working with the more complicated polynomial  @xmath60 rather than  @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , in the inductive step we need to evoke a non - trivial correlation inequality due to newman  @xcite .",
    "our first computational complexity result follows as an almost immediate corollary of theorem  [ thm : lee - yang - ext ] .",
    "[ thm : ising - main ] for any fixed @xmath69 and any fixed @xmath70 , the problem of computing the mean magnetization of the ising model on connected graphs is # p - hard .",
    "moreover , the problem remains # p - hard even when the input is restricted to graphs of maximum degree at most @xmath71 , for any fixed @xmath72 .",
    "note that in the case @xmath73 the mean magnetization is trivially @xmath74 by symmetry .",
    "theorem  [ thm : ising - main ] confirms that in all non - trivial cases , the problem of computing the fundamental average quantity associated with the ising model is as hard as it could possibly be .",
    "furthermore , the result also holds for bounded degree graphs , which are relevant in the statistical physics setting .",
    "the result can also be extended to arbitrary ferromagnetic two - spin systems and to planar graphs : the details can be found in .    we also prove a similar ( but slightly weaker ) result for the _ susceptibility _ of the ising model .",
    "[ thm : ising - main - suscpet ] for any fixed @xmath69 , the problem of computing the susceptibility of the ising model on connected graphs , when @xmath47 is specified in unary , is # p - hard .",
    "moreover , the problem remains # p - hard even when the input is restricted to graphs of maximum degree at most @xmath71 for any @xmath75 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath47 be part of the input seems to be an artifact of the rational interpolation operations we use in our proof . in particular , our proof of theorem  [ thm : ising - main ] shows hardness for _ fixed _",
    "@xmath47 by `` simulating '' different values of @xmath47 by suitably modifying the graph . to adapt this reduction approach to prove hardness for susceptibility ( at fixed values of @xmath47 ) seems to require the polynomial time computation of magnetization as a subroutine . however , we conjecture that computing the susceptibility should be hard even for fixed values of @xmath47 ( including @xmath76 ) .",
    "we then proceed beyond the ising model , and ask about the hardness of computing averages in the monomer - dimer model ( i.e. , weighted matchings ) . a classical result of heilmann and lieb  @xcite establishes an analog of the lee - yang theorem for the zeros of the monomer - dimer partition function  @xmath54 ; however , heilmann and lieb also present examples of ( connected ) graphs  @xmath2 for which  @xmath54 has repeated zeros , so we can not hope to prove an analog of theorem  [ thm : lee - yang - ext ] in this case . on the other hand , heilmann and lieb show that if @xmath2 contains a hamiltonian path then all the zeros of  @xmath54 are simple .",
    "we are able to capitalize on this fact by adapting existing # p - hardness reductions for @xmath54 in such a way that the instances of  @xmath54 that appear in the reduction always contain a hamiltonian path .",
    "specifically , we present a reduction from the problem monotone 2-sat  of counting satisfying assignments of a monotone 2-cnf formula to computing  @xmath54 in hamiltonian graphs  @xmath2 .",
    "the reduction is an elaboration of valiant s original # p - completeness proof for the permanent  @xcite .",
    "this leads to our third computational complexity result .",
    "[ thm : monomer - dimer - main ] for any fixed @xmath28 , the problem of computing the average number of dimers ( equivalently , average size of a matching ) in the monomer - dimer model on connected graphs with edge weights in the set @xmath77 is # p - hard .",
    "moreover , the problem remains # p - hard even when the input is restricted to graphs of maximum degree at most @xmath71 , for any @xmath78 .",
    "note that our hardness result requires a small finite number ( three ) of different values for the edge weights .",
    "however , this requirement can be removed if @xmath2 is allowed to have parallel edges ; the theorem then holds for any single fixed non - zero edge weight ( including the uniform case in which all edge weights are @xmath79 ) .",
    "the study of the location of zeros of the partition function was initiated by yang and lee  @xcite in connection with the analysis of phase transitions . in the follow - up paper",
    "@xcite , they instantiated this approach for the ferromagnetic ising model by proving the celebrated lee - yang theorem on the location of zeros of the partition function and using it to conclude that the ferromagnetic ising model can have at most one phase transition .",
    "the lee - yang approach has since become a cornerstone of the study of phase transitions , and has been used extensively in the statistical physics literature : see , e.g. , @xcite for specific examples , and ruelle s book  @xcite for background . in a slightly different line of work ,",
    "biskup _ et al _",
    "@xcite studied a novel approach to lee - yang theorems for a general class of spin systems on lattice graphs using asymptotic expansions of the partition function .",
    "zeros of partition functions have also been studied in a purely combinatorial setting without reference to the physical interpretation : see , for example , choe _ et al _",
    "@xcite for a collection of such results about zeros of a general class of partition functions .",
    "another important example is the work of chudnovsky and seymour  @xcite , who show that the zeros of the independence polynomial of claw - free graphs lie on the real line .",
    "there have also been attempts to relate the lee - yang program to the riemann hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "lee - yang theorems have also been studied in mathematics in connection with the theory of _ stability preserving _ operators .",
    "the main problem underlying this area is the characterization of linear operators that preserve the class of polynomials , called _",
    "@xmath11-stable _ polynomials , whose zeros lie in some fixed closed set @xmath11 .",
    "this research area has its origins in the work of laguerre  @xcite and of plya and schur  @xcite , and also has connections to control theory  @xcite and to electrical circuit theory  @xcite .",
    "it has also seen considerable recent activity , especially through the breakthrough results of borcea and brndn , who completely characterize stability preserving operators for multivariate polynomials in various important settings  @xcite .",
    "although the study of stability preserving operators is closely related to our problem , there is a crucial difference in that we require our linear differential operator to not only preserve the stability of the partition function , but in fact to _ improve _ it , by restricting the possible locus of the zeros of the derivative to the _ open _ interior of the locus of the zeros of the partition function itself .    in the statistical physics literature , we are aware of only two works which consider the multiplicity of the zeros of the ising partition function : heilmann and lieb  @xcite and biskup _ et al _  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "a theorem similar to our theorem  [ thm : lee - yang - ext ] is proven in the special case when the underlying graph @xmath2 has a hamiltonian path and @xmath26 is close enough to @xmath79 ( depending upon the graph @xmath2 ) .",
    "similarly , in the special case of the ising model , the results of @xcite imply our result but only when @xmath26 is close to @xmath80 , and only in the special case of lattice graphs  @xcite .",
    "note that neither of these results appears to be sufficient for the purposes of our hardness result .",
    "the classification of counting problems associated with partition functions ( via so - called _ dichotomy theorems _ ) has also recently been a very active area of research . for several interesting general classes of partition functions , these theorems characterize the partition function as being either computable in polynomial time or # p - hard  @xcite . however , there appear to be no analogous results on the complexity of averages such as the magnetization .",
    "a related area that we do not deal with in this work is the problem of approximate counting .",
    "recent progress in this area has shown that the complexity of approximating the partition function , as well as that of the related problem of approximate sampling , is closely related to the phase transition phenomenon  @xcite",
    ". however , it is not clear whether hardness results analogous to @xcite can be proven for the approximate computation of the magnetization .",
    "let @xmath62 be an undirected graph .",

    "recall that given a monotone 2-sat formula @xmath281 , the reduction needs to produce in polynomial time a directed graph @xmath2 such that the number of satisfying assignments of @xmath281 can be easily determined from the total weight of cycle covers of @xmath2 , and such that @xmath309 has a hamiltonian path .",
    "our first step is to introduce a shared variable in all the clauses of @xmath281 : this shared variable will be useful later in showing the existence of a hamiltonian path through the gadget .",

    "( see figure  [ fig:3-clause - gadget - m ] ) for each clause in @xmath314 .",
    "each clause gadget has one external dotted edge for each literal in the clause , and is designed so that no cycle cover can include all the dotted edges ; and so that for any other subset of the dotted edges , there is exactly one cycle cover including all the edges in the subset and no others . for each clause gadget",
    ", we label each of the three dotted edges in the gadget with one of the three literals appearing in the clause .",
    "however , in this step , we ensure that in each gadget the @xmath320 dotted edge is the one labeled with the literal @xmath312 , since this is needed to show that the final construction has a hamiltonian path .",
    "we now `` pair '' each dotted edge appearing in a clause gadget with a dotted edge corresponding to the same literal in a variable gadget , so that each dotted edge appears in exactly one pair .",
    "we first consider cycle covers which obey the constraint that they must choose _ exactly _ one edge from each such pair .",
    "we claim that the number of cycle covers satisfying this `` pairing '' constraint equals the number of satisfying assignments of @xmath314 .",
    "to see this , we associate a truth assignment with every cycle cover by setting the variable @xmath90 to _ true _ if the cycle cover uses all the dotted edges in the variable gadget for @xmath90 , and to _ false _ if it uses none of the dotted edges .",
    "notice that because of the pairing constraint , a cycle cover is uniquely determined by specifying its assignment .",
    "further , given the above properties of the clause gadget , exactly those cycle covers are permitted whose associated assignments are satisfying assignments of @xmath314 .",
    "we now enforce the `` pairing '' constraint referred to above using a gadget similar to valiant s _ xor - gadget_. the xor - gadget has two _ ports _ ( labeled @xmath200 and @xmath321 ) , each of which admits one incoming and one outgoing edge ( see figure  [ fig : xor - gadget - main ] ) . to ensure the `` pairing '' constraint for a pair of dotted edges @xmath322 and @xmath323 , we replace them by the incoming - outgoing pair of a single xor - gadget ( see figure  [ fig : use - xor - gadget ] ) .",
    "the gadget has the property that after the replacement , the weight of every cycle cover which would have included exactly one of the two dotted edges @xmath324 and @xmath323 in the original graph gets multiplied by a factor of @xmath325 ( for each replacement made ) , while the weight of any cycle covers not satisfying the pairing constraint becomes @xmath80 ( see for a proof ) .",
    "the total weight of all cycle covers in the final graph so obtained is therefore @xmath326 , where @xmath327 is the number of satisfying assignments and @xmath328 is the total number of literals in @xmath314 ( since one xor - gadget is needed to replace the pair of dotted edges for each literal ) .",
    "further , replacing a pair of edges by a xor gadget does not change the in - degree or out - degree of any vertex already present .",
    "note that the xor - gadget has edges of weight @xmath329 , which are not permitted in the monomer - dimer model .",
    "this can be remedied by replacing the @xmath329 weight edges by a large chain of edges ( of length , say , @xmath330 where @xmath187 is the number of edges in the original graph ) of weight 2 , with individual vertices in the chain having self loops ( of weight 1 ) .",
    "the total weight of cycle covers in the new graph modulo @xmath331 then gives the total weight of cycle covers in the original graph .",
    "this last step of replacing the @xmath329 edge by a long chain presents a challenge since we will need to include all the vertices in the chain in our hamiltonian path ( equivalently , all @xmath329 weight edges must appear in the hamiltonian path ) .",
    "for this reason , we can not use valiant s xor - gadget directly .",
    "our xor - gadget , on the other hand , is such that the @xmath329 weight edges can always be included in our hamiltonian path .",
    "however , we have to be careful in the orientation of the xor - gadgets : when replacing a pair of dotted edges one of which belongs to @xmath312 s variable gadget , we orient the xor - gadget so that the incoming edge at vertex @xmath200 in the xor - gadget comes from the variable gadget . at all other pairs ,",
    "we orient the xor - gadgets so that the incoming edge at the vertex @xmath200 comes from a clause gadget .    0.4    0.4",

    "the conventional notion of efficiency in complexity theory is computability in time polynomial in the size of the input .",
    "for example , the problem of finding the shortest path between two specified vertices in a graph ( presented as an adjacency matrix ) can be solved in `` polynomial time '' , e.g. , using djikstra s algorithm .",
    "this notion of efficiency is captured by the complexity class p. for technical reasons we consider _ decision problems _ , where the answer is either ` yes ' or ` no ' .",
    "for example , the decision version of the shortest path problem would be to determine , given an integer @xmath333 , if there is a path of length at most @xmath333 between the two specified vertices .",
    "a decision problem is said to be in the class p if there is an algorithm for it that runs in time polynomial in the size of the input .",
    "examples of problems known to be in @xmath334 include deciding if a graph has an eulerian tour , deciding whether an integer ( presented in binary ) is prime  @xcite , etc .",
    "the class np is the class of decision problems for which a polynomial time algorithm can verify the correctness of a ` yes ' answer given a _",
    "certificate _ of correctness .",
    "for example , we consider sat , the problem of deciding whether a given boolean formula has a satisfying assignment . while this problem is conjectured to not belong in the class p , it is clearly in np : the certificate for a formula being satisfiable is just a satisfying assignment , if any , of the formula .",
    "formally , a problem is said to be in np if there is an algorithm @xmath263 and a polynomial @xmath137 such that for any instance @xmath335 of the problem :    1 .",
    "if @xmath335 is a ` yes ' instance , then there exists a certificate @xmath210 such that on input @xmath336 , @xmath263 runs in time at most @xmath337 and outputs ` yes ' .",
    "if @xmath335 is a ` no ' instance , then for any certificate @xmath210 , on input @xmath336 , @xmath263 runs in time at most @xmath337 and outputs ` no ' .",
    "another example of a problem in np is deciding whether a graph @xmath2 has a hamiltonian cycle ( where the certificate is a hamiltonian cycle , if any , in the graph ) .",
    "both of the above examples are also _ np - hard _ , that is , if there is a polynomial time algorithm for either of them , then there are polynomial time algorithms for all problems in np .",
    "it is clear that p @xmath338 np , but it is a long standing conjecture in complexity theory that p @xmath339 np . np - hardness has long been the standard notion of intractability for decision problems , since the pioneering work of cook  @xcite , levin  @xcite and karp  @xcite .",
    "the class # p , introduced by valiant  @xcite , is a counting analog of np : any problem in # p involves counting the number of certificates ( possibly zero ) that would make an algorithm for an np - problem accept .",
    "an example of a problem in # p is counting the number of satisfying assignments of a given sat formula .",
    "as in the case of np - hardness , a counting problem is called _",
    "# p - hard _ if a polynomial time algorithm for the problem implies the existence of polynomial time algorithms for all problems in # p.    counting versions of most np - complete problems ( such as counting the number of satisfying assignments of a boolean formula ) can be shown to be # p - hard . however , there are decision problems in p whose counting analogs are still # p - hard , and it is this fact that makes the theory of # p - hardness a non - trivial extension of the theory of np - hardness .",
    "a famous example is counting the number of dimer coverings ( perfect matchings ) of a given graph : edmonds  @xcite showed that there is a polynomial time algorithm for checking whether a graph has a dimer covering ; however , counting the number of such coverings in general graphs is # p - hard  @xcite .",
    "# p - hardness has since become the standard notion of intractability for counting problems and for the computation of partition functions in statistical physics : indeed , almost all interesting classes of partition functions are known to be # p - hard to compute ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath321-regular graph @xmath2 in the reduction , and use theorem  [ thm : cai - kowalczyk - planar ] instead of theorem  [ thm : hardness - regular ] as our starting hardness result . since @xmath2 is planar ,",
