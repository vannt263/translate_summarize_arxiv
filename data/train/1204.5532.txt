    "it is well known that in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , a clumpy low - temperature phase [ cold neutral medium ( cnm ) ] and a diffuse high - temperature phase [ warm neutral medium ( wnm ) ] can coexist in pressure equilibrium as a result of the balance of radiative cooling and heating owing to external radiation fields and cosmic rays @xcite .",

    "these two phases are thermally stable . on the other hand , the thermal instability ( ti )",
    "arises in the temperature range between these two phases .",
    "thus , the ism in atomic phase can be interpreted as bistable fluid .",
    "pioneering work on the ti has been done by @xcite who performed a linear analysis of the thermal equilibrium gas and derived a simple criterion for the ti .",

    "the thickness of the transition front is characterized by the field length below which the ti is stabilized by heat conduction @xcite .",
    "they found that a static solution is obtained at a so - called saturation pressure .",
    "the transition front becomes a condensation ( evaporation ) front if surrounding pressure is larger ( less ) than the saturation pressure .",
    "these properties of the transition front depend on its geometry . in the spherical symmetric geometry , @xcite investigated isobaric flows .",
    "they found that spherical clouds have a minimum size below which they inevitably evaporate ( more general description is found in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "linear stability of the transition layers has been investigated by @xcite in the plane - parallel geometry , and they found that the evaporation front is unstable against corrugation type fluctuation , while the condensation front is stable . @xcite have considered the effect of magnetic field on the instability .",
    "the physical mechanism of the corrugation instability is analogous to the darriues - landau instability @xcite .",
    "taking into account magnetic field perpendicular to the normal of the front , @xcite investigated linear stability of transition layers .    in the above - mentioned theoretical works with respect to the bistable fluid , the phase transition proceeds in a quasi - static manner through the heat conduction",
    "however , recent multidimensional numerical simulations show more a dynamical turbulent structure . @xcite",
    "have investigated the non - linear development of the ti in the three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with periodic boundary condition without any external forcing .",
    "as the initial condition , they set the hot ionized medium ( @xmath3 k ) where cooling dominates heating . the gas is quickly decomposed into two stable phases ( cnm and wnm ) and the intermediate unstable phase . in the multiphase medium , the supersonic turbulence",
    "is developed by conversion from the thermal energy to the kinetic energy .",

    "the influence of the magnetic field on the development of the ti has been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    although physics of the bistable fluid is developing , the physical mechanism of driving turbulence is not fully understood . as mentioned above",
    ", recent numerical simulations have found that the turbulence involving the ti is dynamical compared with the zp69 picture that predicts very slow transition between cnm and wnm through the heat conduction .",
    "moreover , in the shock compressed region , because of its high pressure , the bistable fluid can not exist . the zp69 picture can not be applied directly to the ti in the shock compressed region .    in this paper , as a first step to understand the dynamical turbulent structure , we develop the works of zp69 into a more dynamical transition front . in the steady solutions , there are two parameters , the pressure of the cnm and the mass flux across the front . zp69 considered solutions only on a line in the parameter space .",

    ", physics of shock waves and high temperature hydrodynamic phenomena ( new york : academic )",
    "in this appendix , we present steady solutions with shock front . here",
    ", we assume that preshock gas is in thermal equilibrium state . the physical variables in preshock gas",
    "are denoted by using the subscript of `` e '' .",
    "the position of the shock front @xmath137 is determined so that the rankine - hugoniot relation is satisfied between the solutions and the thermal equilibrium state by the following method .",
    "given @xmath137 , the specific energy flux is given by @xmath138 where the subscript of `` sh '' denotes physical variables at @xmath137 , and @xmath139 is the effective sound speed .",
    "the simple relation among @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 is given by @xmath143 from equation ( [ v ] ) , one can get @xmath141 , and the mach number @xmath144 is obtained . from the rankine - hugoniot relations , the physical variables in the preshock gas ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) are obtained . in general , the preshock gas is not in thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the position of the shock front @xmath147 is determined iteratively until @xmath148 is satisfied by using the bisection method .    as examples , we consider two cases of @xmath149 and 24@xmath107 for @xmath150k @xmath1 . for @xmath151 case ,",
    "the corresponding physical quantities of the preshock gas are @xmath152 @xmath1 and @xmath153 . for @xmath154",
    ", they are @xmath155 @xmath1 and @xmath156 .",
    "thus , the preshock gases belong to the wnm for @xmath151 and cnm for @xmath157 .",
    "the upper panels of figures [ fig : mesh]a and [ fig : mesh]b show the density , temperature , and pressure distribution for @xmath158 and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "the lower panels of figure [ fig : mesh ] show the trajectories of obtained solutions in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "in addition , we perform one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulation in order to confirm the steady state solutions with shock front are realized .",
    "we consider colliding wall problem where the gas flows collide at @xmath159 with @xmath160 from @xmath161 .",
    "two shock wave propagates from @xmath159 outward .",
    "shock heated gas quickly cools until the gas reaches the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "after that , the cold layer forms and its thickness grows by gas accretion .",
    "the thick gray line in each panel of figure [ fig : mesh ] indicate the results of one - dimensional simulations in the growing phase of the cold layer .",
    "one can see that the results of one - dimensional simulations are well described by the steady - state solutions ."

    "<S> in this paper , we investigate the structure of condensation fronts from warm diffuse gas to cold neutral medium ( cnm ) under the plane parallel geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions have two parameters , the pressure of the cnm and the mass flux across the transition front , and their ranges are much wider than previously thought . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the pressure range where the three phases , the cnm , the unstable phase , and the warm neutral medium , can coexist in the pressure equilibrium . in a wide range of the mass flux , we find solutions connecting the cnm and the unstable phase . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find solutions in larger pressure range where there is only one thermal equilibrium state or the cnm . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions can be realized in shock - compressed regions that are promising sites of molecular cloud formation . </S>",
    "<S> we also find remarkable properties in our solutions . </S>",
    "<S> heat conduction becomes less important with increasing mass flux , and the thickness of the transition layer is characterized by the cooling length instead of the field length .    </S>",
