    "this suggests that only a small fraction of the volume in these galaxies occupied by gas is associated with dense regions . also , these model parameters suggest that the low - excitation gas components fill a dominant fraction of the area over which the sources are resolved in these observations .",
    "the physical properties of the low - excitation gas components in these models are comparable to those of the gas in nearby spiral galaxies and ` normal ' high-@xmath0 star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , dannerbauer @xcite ) and the low - excitation components found in other smgs ( e.g. , carilli et al .",

    "@xcite ) , we can also estimate the dynamical masses of our targets . assuming fwhm radii of 3kpc for  h6 and h7 , we find @xmath54=9.7 and 28.3@xmath510@xmath9@xmath47 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to gas mass fractions @xmath55=@xmath8/@xmath56=0.210.45 and 0.160.45 for h6 and h7 , where the spread of values represents the use of different conversion factors as outlined above .",

    "the emission in  is spread over an area with a characteristic radius of 7.9kpc .",

    "the co emission centroids in h6 and h7 are offset by @xmath11.5kpc ( 0.2@xmath23 ) from the centers of the optical emission , but are clearly associated with fainter , potentially more obscured regions in the galaxies .",
    "the optical emission in  appears to be associated with one of the co peaks in the central region , and thus , potentially with one component of a major merger ( or a region of low dust obscuration ) .",

    "emission in  is detected toward both radio / millimeter continuum sources h6 and h7 , which have been detected in higher-@xmath6 co lines in earlier work .",
    "there is marginal evidence for additional  emission in between the two sources , which are separated by @xmath130kpc in projection .",
    "this , and their proximity in redshift ( d@xmath0@xmath330.01 ) is consistent with the picture that this smg is undergoing an early stage massive , gas - rich merger ( see also engel et al.@xcite ) . the  line in h7 , the more co - luminous component , appears to show a @xmath150% larger line width and size relative to what is measured in higher-@xmath6 co lines , but the values are marginally consistent within the relative uncertainties .",
    "the  emission in  shows a bright central peak that appears to be associated with the emission that dominates the flux in higher-@xmath6 co lines .",
    "it also shows @xmath112@xmath5 broader emission ( as also seen in single - dish observations at low spatial resolution ; hainline et al.@xcite ) distributed over several peaks that extends out to @xmath1115kpc scales , but appears to be faint in higher-@xmath6 co lines .",
    "thus , the evla  observations reveal a spatially resolved co excitation gradient in this smg .",
    "this may suggest that this smg is in an advanced stage of a merger , where the warm and dense , highly excited gas component predominantly arises from a starburst in the `` overlap '' region of two gas - rich galaxies , and the broader , more extended , less highly excited gas is associated with tidal structure redistributed by the merger .",
    "more sensitive observations are required to study the dynamical structure of this complex system in more detail .",
    "the  properties of  contrast those of high-@xmath0 quasars , which appear to be dominated by less extended ( @xmath15kpc ) , highly excited molecular gas reservoirs , with only little evidence for low - excitation gas ( e.g. , riechers et al .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; wei  et al.@xcite ) .",
    "they also contrast those of lensed @xmath0@xmath13 lyman - break galaxies , which typically have an order of magnitude less massive , compact ( @xmath112kpc )  reservoirs ( riechers et al.@xcite ; see also higher-@xmath6 co observations by baker et al .",
    "@xcite ; coppin et al .",
    "massive , gas - rich star - forming galaxies can host gas reservoirs comparable in extent to those found in our target smgs , but their spatial and velocity structure typically appears more symmetric and ordered ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "@xcite ) . also , their overall co excitation appears to be lower ( dannerbauer et al .",
    "@xcite ; aravena et al .",
    "low co excitation was also found in the @xmath0=1.44 smg hr10 , which was initially selected as an extremely red object ( ero ; andreani et al .",
    "@xcite ; papadopoulos & ivison @xcite ; greve et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the new  observations of the @xmath0@xmath13.4 smgs and  provide supporting evidence that they represent early and advanced stage , gas - rich major mergers .",
    "recent , lower resolution  studies of the @xmath120kpc separation merger smmj123707 + 6214 ( @xmath0=2.488 ; ivison et al .  @xcite ; riechers et al .",
    "@xcite ) may suggest an intermediate merger stage ( with two separated components , but closer in projected distance and redshift than in ) , in between those observed in these two targets .",
    "these evla observations thus may be a first step toward establishing a molecular gas - based `` merger sequence '' for gas - rich starburst galaxies at high redshift , which may crucially constrain formation models of smgs ( e.g. , dav et al.@xcite ; hayward et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if the  properties of the @xmath0@xmath13.4 systems studied here are representative of their parent population , smgs in advanced merger stages exhibit substantially more extended , broader low-@xmath6 co line emission than in earlier merger stages .",
    "observations of high-@xmath6 co line emission alone will underestimate the gas content and extent of the tidal structure in advanced - stage mergers , yielding an incomplete picture of the processes that drive the gas dynamics in such systems .",
    "the observations presented here thus show the key importance of spatially and dynamically resolved  observations of smgs to understand the gas physics that drive star formation in these luminous , massive gas - rich high redshift galaxies . in combination with higher-@xmath6 co line observations with shorter wavelength interferometers such as the upcoming atacama large ( sub)millimeter array ( alma ) ,",
    "this makes the evla a uniquely powerful tool to distinguish different high-@xmath0 galaxy populations based on their molecular gas content .",

    "<S> we derive  line luminosities of @xmath2kpc@xmath3 for h6 and h7 , and @xmath4kpc@xmath3 for smmj13120 + 4242 . </S>",
    "<S> these are @xmath11.54.5@xmath5 higher than what is expected from simple excitation modeling of higher-@xmath6 co lines , suggesting the presence of copious amounts of low - excitation gas . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the finding that the  line in smmj13120 + 4242 , the system with lowest co excitation , appears to have a broader profile and more extended spatial structure than seen in higher-@xmath6 co lines ( which is less prominently seen in smmj09431 + 4700 ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on @xmath7 and excitation modeling , we find @xmath8=2.04.3 and 4.712.7@xmath510@xmath9  for h6 and h7 , and @xmath10=18.769.4@xmath510@xmath9  for smmj13120 + 4242 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed  properties are consistent with the picture that smmj09431 + 4700 represents an early - stage , gas - rich major merger , and that smmj13120 + 4242 represents such a system in an advanced stage . </S>",
    "<S> this study thus highlights the importance of spatially and dynamically resolved  observations of smgs to further understand the gas physics that drive star formation in these distant galaxies , which becomes possible only now that the evla rises to its full capabilities . </S>"
