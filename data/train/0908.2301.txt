    "studies of the regge limit for scattering amplitudes go back to the 1960ies when experiments started to explore the high energy regime of quantum field theories . in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the weak coupling limit of the regge limit turned out to be dominated by the bfkl pomeron @xcite which represents a bound state of two reggeized gluons .",
    "more general , high energy scattering amplitudes in qcd can be written in terms of reggeon field theory with  reggeized gluons @xcite as the fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "the bfkl pomeron is an intriguing starting point for analyzing both the nlo corrections @xcite to the bfkl kernel and for generalizing the bfkl equation to the more complex bkp states in the @xmath2 channel @xcite . in the context of large-@xmath3 limits",
    ", the bfkl pomeron represents the leading approximation of the elastic scattering amplitude ( color singlet exchange ) .",
    "the bkp states have been found to be integrable for large @xmath3 @xcite , and these links of high energy qcd with integrable models have raised hopes for at least partial solutions .",
    "investigations of the planar regge limit were mostly performed perturbatively , i.e.  for small t hooft coupling @xmath4 . up until 1997 , strongly coupled gauge theory has remained largely inaccessible , at least with analytical tools .",
    "the situation has changed through the discovery of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "it relates many interesting superconformal gauge theories to string theories in anti - de sitter backgrounds .",
    "the simplest example of such a correspondence involves @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in four space - time dimensions .",
    "this theory is an attractive toy model .",
    "while being severely constrained by its symmetries , the leading regge asymptotics is identical to that of qcd .",
    "the dual description is given by type iib string theory on @xmath5 .",
    "even though the latter is very difficult to solve completely , calculations may be performed for large radius @xmath0 of @xmath6 using the approximate description through classical supergravity . according to the ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "the supergravity limit of string theory is dual to gauge theory at strong coupling @xmath7 .    in quantum chromodynamics",
    ", the scattering of electromagnetic currents provides a reliable environment for studying the pomeron @xcite : at large virtuality of the external photons , the qcd coupling constant is small , and the use of perturbation theory is justified . @xmath8",
    "super yang - mills theory contains close relatives of electromagnetic current @xcite , namely the @xmath0-currents which belong to the global @xmath9 group .",
    "therefore , is seems natural to further explore the pomeron , within the ads / cft correspondence , by investigating four - point correlators of @xmath0-currents in @xmath10 super yang - mills theory . in the weakly coupled regime ,",
    "the relevant correlation functions have been investigated @xcite .",
    "similar to the qcd case , in the high energy limit the scattering amplitude has the form of a convolution of the two @xmath0-current impact factors _",
    "p_ap_b(s , t)=is _ p_a(q_a^2;,- ) _",
    "p_b(q_b^2;,- ) , [ eq:2gluon ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are two - dimensional transverse momentum vectors with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the virtualities of the two incoming @xmath0-currents ( for simplicity we take the virtualities of the outgoing currents to be identical to the incoming ones ) .",
    "helicity is conserved , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote the polarizations of the two incoming external currents ( transverse or longitudinal ) .",
    "the impact factors @xmath18 , @xmath19 for the @xmath0-currents in @xmath1 have been calculated explicitly  @xcite . when including higher order corrections in the leading logarithmic approximation the two gluon propagators are replaced by the bfkl green s function _",

    "p_a(q_a^2;,- ) g(,-;,- ; ) _ p_b(q_b^2 ; ,- ) , [ bfkl ] and the leading singularity in the @xmath20 plane is located at @xmath21 .",
    "it may be worthwhile to recall that the high energy behavior ( [ bfkl ] ) also allows to address the short distance behavior of the operator product of the @xmath0-currents : by considering the limit @xmath22 ( like in deep inelastic electron proton scattering ) , the bfkl green s function can be used to derive , in particular , the anomalous dimension of the leading twist two gluon operator expanded around the point @xmath23 .    as we recalled in the previous paragraph , the limit of strong coupling is determined by classical supergravity .",
    "techniques for the relevant supergravity computations were developed starting from @xcite .",
    "they have been applied to calculate many two- and three - point correlation functions @xcite as well as four - point correlators @xcite . just as in the case of weak coupling ,",
    "most of the supergravity amplitudes possess unpleasant divergencies which must be renormalized @xcite . in evaluating the regge limit of four - point amplitudes",
    "we actually meet a pleasant surprise .",
    "it turns out that uv - divergent terms do not contribute to the high energy regge limit of scattering amplitudes .",
    "the main reason is that , in the regge limit , the coordinates of the @xmath0-currents on the boundaries are well separated from each other , thus avoiding the ultraviolet divergencies .",
    "therefore , none of the calculations performed below requires holographic renormalization .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the high energy limit for the four - point correlation function of @xmath0-currents at strong coupling , restricting ourselves to the leading term , i.e. in the supergravity regime .",
    "we evaluate contributions from graviton and gauge boson exchange in the bulk and show that the leading regge asymptotics is determined entirely by the t - channel exchange of bulk gravitons .",
    "all other amplitudes , including those from s- and u - channel exchange of gravitons and of gauge bosons , are suppressed by at least one power of the energy .",
    "let us mention that there exist a variety of other approaches to high energy scattering at strong coupling @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our work has a somewhat different take in that is focuses on @xmath0-currents .",
    "furthermore , the results are obtained by thoroughly analyzing the underlying witten diagrams , without any shortcuts or additional assumptions .",
    "let us briefly describe the content of the following sections .",
    "we shall begin with a more expository part in which some of the relevant background material is presented . in order to define the high energy limit in section [ sc : ft ] all relevant propagators",
    "must be transformed to momentum space .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a rather detailed calculation of the graviton exchange .",
    "the corresponding scattering amplitude is proportional to the square of the total energy , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the properties of the amplitude are investigated in some detail .",
    "in particular , after performing an inverse fourier transform on the transverse momenta of the process , we find a simple closed expression in configuration space .",
    "the resulting expression for the regge limit of the graviton exchange can be written rather compactly in terms of a scalar propagator of @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , we determine the expansion coefficients for the amplitude written as a series in the exchanged momentum .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of the forward scattering amplitude on the virtualities of the process . in section [ sc : be ] we calculate the regge limit of gauge boson exchange for general values of the exchanged momentum . as expected for the exchange of a vector boson ,",
    "the amplitude is proportional to the total energy @xmath26 .",
