    "simulations also suggest that the evolution of this dark matter imprints a signature on much smaller scales .",
    "in fact , it is expected that cdm will cluster gravitationally on subgalactic scales . within the framework of hierarchical formation scenarios ( searle & zinn 1978 ) , it is the merging and accretion of these subhalos that is thought to build up massive galaxies such as the milky way and our neighbor the andromeda spiral galaxy ( m31 ) .",
    "the cores of the cdm subhalos that fall into massive potentials to form large galaxies are expected to remain intact , even after experiencing strong tides through several orbital timescales around the host galaxy ( hayashi et  al.2003 ) .",

    "the final extracted spectra are next processed through the * spec1d * software pipeline , also developed by the deep2 team at ucb .",
    "this software cross - correlates the observed spectrum with a large database of both template stellar spectra ( multiple a , b , f , g , k , l , m type , and carbon star ) and template emission- and absorption - line galaxy spectra to determine the red / blueshift for all objects .",

    "in addition to the radial velocity measurements , which are based on the cross - correlation of all features in the spectrum , we also assign a spectral quality index to each object based on what spectral features are obvious / visible relative to the noise .",

    "such a stream has not been detected in star - count maps of m31 .",

    "the predicted velocity of the stream during its fall back is estimated to be @xmath106  km  s@xmath2 near the projected location of h13s on the north - south plane as defined by ibata et  al .",
    "however , such an orbit ( see figure  4(d ) of ibata et  al .",
    "2004 ) predicts that the secondary population would lie almost 2 degrees east of the giant southern stream and therefore can not explain these data .",
    "we note that the stream s very small pericenter distance makes the post - pericentric portion of the orbit strongly dependent on the ( uncertain ) details of m31 s inner potential ( geehan et  al .",
    "the test particle orbit approximation used in the simulations above is clearly an oversimplification .",
    "more realistic modelling using @xmath107-body satellites ( e.g. , fardal et  al .",
    "2005 ) shows that although the secondary peak in these data can not be reproduced by the stream s orbit , reasonable orbits can be derived that connect several other prominent features / satellites of m31 with the stream : northern spur , m32 , and  ne , and a concentration in the planetary nebulae system discovered by merrett et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) . connecting these features with the stream is possible given that the phase of the progenitor is unknown ( i.e. , m32 has an inconsistent radial velocity with stream stars in its present location , however , its present location could be one radial orbit ahead of the visible debris ) .",
    "better orbital calculations to narrow down the progenitor and orbit of the stream require more observational constraints , especially in the locations close to m31 where the stream s orbit is not well constrained .",
    "we can also address the nature of the secondary peak in our velocity histogram , and whether or not it may be related to the stream , by investigating the chemical composition of stars in the peak . in figure",
    "[ fig : streammet ] , we present a three - panel view of the velocity histogram ( top ) , photometric [ fe / h ] estimate vs.  radial velocity ( middle ) , and spectroscopic [ fe / h ] estimate vs.  radial velocity ( bottom ) for the stream field h13s .",
    "the middle and bottom panel of this diagram indicate that the mean metallicity , and metallicity dispersion , of the populations in the primary and secondary peaks are very similar .",
    "the only difference in the photometric metallicity distribution of stars in the two peaks is a small tail with higher metallicities in the secondary population that is lacking in the primary .",
    "this difference is subtle , constrained by only a few stars in the photometric metallicity diagram and is not seen in the spectroscopic metallicity distribution .    in figure",
    "[ fig : photmet ] , we fit the metallicity distributions of these two kinematically distinct populations to gaussians and find that indeed the distributions are very similar .",

    "although the similar nature of the metallicity distributions in these two peaks naively suggests a similar origin for the stars , we note that the mean metallicity and metallicity dispersion of stars in the disk of m31 are also similar to those of the stream ( reitzel et  al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "therefore , from these data alone , it is equally likely that the secondary peak represents some component of the disk of m31 ( e.g. , a warp or an overdensity induced by satellite interaction  see  [ interpdisk ] ) .",
    "another possible variation could be that the observed secondary velocity peak does not necessarily represent a different part of the orbit of the giant stream , but rather some unbound debris that is orbiting differentially from the main body of the stream .",
    "future simulations with added constraints from these data and future observations ( see  [ future ] ) will explore these possibilities and likely shed light on any relation of this population to the giant southern stream .",
    "we noted earlier that the metallicity distribution of stars in the secondary peak are similar to the disk field h13d ( although they are at odds with the metallicity reported for the extended disk of m31 by ibata et  al .  2005 ) .",
    "the ibata et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) star - count map ( see their fig .",

    "in fact , the expected blueshift of stars in m31 s disk at the location of h13s agrees well with the location of the secondary peak in the velocity histogram .",
    "the fits of sawa & sofue ( 1981 ) to the hi contours of cram , roberts , & whitehurst ( 1980 ) also suggest that the disk velocity at this location is similar to that measured in the secondary peak .",
    "if the secondary peak does represent disk stars this would be an important constraint on determining the extent to which the stellar disk of m31 dominates over the spheroid / halo ( worthey et  al .",
    "2005 ) .    to test the hypothesis that the secondary cold component represents the smooth disk of m31 ,",
    "we have computed the @xmath35-band surface brightness that corresponds to the stars in the secondary peak of our data ( 29  stars with @xmath108  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the surface brightness computation is based on first using the results of  [ cleansample ] to isolate both confirmed m31 rgb stars and confirmed milky way dwarf stars .",
    "we note that the sampling rate and the degree of incompleteness between these two populations is similar in our field",
    ". the observed ratio of these stars , m31 rgb to foreground galactic dwarfs , is then multiplied by the surface density of milky way stars predicted by a galactic star - count model ( ratnatunga & bahcall 1985 ) .",
    "this surface density only enters our final surface brightness estimate in a relative sense as we will be comparing the stream field to other fields , such as the h13d disk measurement .",
    "therefore , any absolute mismatch between the galactic star count model and the data is not important - only variations in the degree of mismatch across the fields being considered . finally , we normalized the measurements to the @xmath35-band surface brightness estimates obtained by ostheimer ( 2002 ) using a @xmath67-selected photometric sample of m31 rgb candidates .",

    "since the apparent brightness and metallicity ranges of stars in both peaks is virtually identical , taking the ratio also eliminates any possible biases ( e.g. , there may be variations in the degree of completeness from one study to another , but this should affect both primary and secondary peak populations equally ) .",

    "this second cold population has never been reported before .",
    "a close look at previous spectroscopic observations reveals evidence that this second group of stars is not associated with the smooth disk of m31 , but rather may represent a new satellite debris trail , a wrapped around component of the giant southern stream , or a tidally - disrupted population of disk stars .",
    "future observations of the inner regions of the stream will help constrain models for its orbit and put better limits on which , if any , of m31 s satellites may be the progenitor .",
