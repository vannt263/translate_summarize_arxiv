    "various studies have been devoted to quantum propagation in disordered lattices , including site and hopping disorder . here",
    "we study time dependent hopping : in general the adiabatic motion of a particle in a `` hot '' background .",
    "the motion of a charge in a rapidly fluctuating effective magnetic field belongs to this class : here we give a lattice version of the problem .",
    "time - dependent fluctuations of the magnetic field have been considered by aronov and wolfle in studying the behavior of doped high-@xmath0 materials , close to the metal - insulator transition @xcite : their analysis was motivated by magnetoresistence measurements @xcite in bi 2:2:0:1 compounds .",
    "tight binding hamiltonians were also considered for the dynamics of flux lines in superconductors , a widely investigated topic , both at the experimental and at the theoretical level : see , e.g.,@xcite,@xcite and references therein .",
    "columnar defects , artificially produced by energetic heavy ion radiation , have been used in order to pin flux lines and reduce dissipation .",
    "greatly enhanced pinning has been obtained , e.g. , in @xmath1 crystals with aligned columnar defects , produced by @xmath2-ion radiation @xcite,@xcite . in the corresponding path",
    "integral description , the euclidean time is the the vortex line parameter and    the horizontal coordinates of the columnar defects @xcite define the lattice nodes . in a hollow cylindrical superconductor the longitudinal current creates a transverse magnetic field which forces the flux lines to tilt with respect to the vertical alignment . in the hamiltonian",
    "this translates into a term , linear in the momentum @xcite@xcite , and antihermitean .",
    "it can obviously be read as originating from an imaginary vector potential .",
    "this term explicitly breaks the space inversion symmetry : in fact the particle has different left and right hopping amplitudes ( in a given direction ) .",
    "this is not to be confused with a chiral particle , characterized by single - sided but unitary propagation .",
    "motion with a preferred orientation arises in various non - quantum mechanical contexts , e.g. in population dynamics@xcite , in the transport of passive scalars in fluids @xcite , in directed percolation .",
    "the nonhermitean hopping term has the effect of depinning the vortex lines , as shown by various authors : @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "here we first consider time - dependent hopping with no bias . due to",
    "the averaging , the appropriate object to be studied , rather than the wave function , is the density matrix . in terms of it",
    "one reconstructs every transition probability .",
    "our approach relies on a second quantization formalism , which proved to be very efficient in describing edge states in quantum hall systems @xcite . in the limit of fast fluctuations memory effects",
    "are canceled and the effective dynamics is described by a liouvillian operator ( see section 2 ) .",
    "we find that the quantum particle undergoes classical diffusion . in section 3",
    "we add the deterministic bias : the liouvillian , in the second quantization formalism , takes then the form of the so - called pair hopping model hamiltonian @xcite,@xcite .",
    "pure diffusion is now always frustrated ; we find excitonic states , propagating with a nontrivial dispersion law . in section 4",
    "we summarize our results and compare them with related work . in appendix 1",
    "we derive a property for averages of time - ordered exponential operators ; in appendix 2 we show that the transition probability , in the hermitean case , can be obtained by resumming the ladder diagrams , i.e. that it coincides with the diffuson amplitude .",
    "we start with a lattice hamiltonian with time - dependent hopping disorder , including an antihermitean term : @xmath3\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 , d is the lattice dimension . we assume zero average gaussian coefficients ; the various amplitudes are mutually independent , with correlators : @xmath5 as previously announced , we deal with the density operator in the second quantization formalism .",
    "we introduce two , mutually commuting , fermi ( or equivalently bose ) operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 , related with two independent copies of the system . before averaging ,",
    "they are associated with the retarded and advanced particle , and evolve independently with evolutors @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we define the operator @xmath10 , as the second - quantized evolution operator : its matrix elements in the 1 + 1 particle sector are : @xmath11    @xmath10 is associated with the following two - particle hamiltonian : @xmath12\\nonumber\\\\ % + \\sum_{x}v(x;t)\\cdot { \\hat q}(x)\\nonumber\\\\ { \\hat c}(x , \\mu ) & = & { \\hat a}^{+}(x)\\cdot { \\hat a}(x+e_{\\mu } )   - { \\hat b}^{+}(x+e_{\\mu})\\cdot { \\hat b}(x)\\nonumber\\\\ { \\hat b}(x , \\mu ) & = & { \\hat a}^{+}(x)\\cdot { \\hat a}(x+e_{\\mu } )   + { \\hat b}^{+}(x+e_{\\mu})\\cdot { \\hat b}(x)\\nonumber\\\\ { \\hat q}(x)&= & { \\hat a}^{+}(x)\\cdot{\\hat a}(x)- { \\hat b}^{+}(x)\\cdot{\\hat b}(x)\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the fact that the disorder is @xmath13-correlated in time , one can exactly perform the average of the neumann series and reexponentiate the result , thus obtaining : @xmath14\\ ] ] the effective liouvillian @xmath15 has the form : @xmath16 , % & + & { 1 \\over 2 } \\sum_{x}a(x;t)\\cdot{\\hat q}^{2}(x),\\ ] ] here @xmath17 denotes the anticommutator .",
    "the average has generated a quartic term , which couples the particle and the antiparticle .",
    "the nonlinearity can be easily handled in this case : in fact @xmath15 can be written as a quantum spin hamiltonian @xcite , if one starts with the fermionic representation .",
    "one verifies that an angular momentum algebra is obtained from @xmath6 and @xmath18 .",
    "the angular momentum is given by : @xmath19 if we define @xmath20 ; the liouvillian turns into : @xmath21\\nonumber % & + & { 1 \\over 2 } \\sum_{x } a(x;t)\\cdot{\\hat q}^{2}(x)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the planar term , which describes pair hopping , is ferromagnetic . the vertical term , which counts the particles , turns from ferro to antiferromagnetic as the antihermitean disorder overcomes the hermitean one .",
    "the angular momentum operators commute with the charge operators @xmath22 .",
    "similarly the total number @xmath23 of @xmath24-type particles , @xmath25 , and @xmath22 commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "obviously , as long as we are concerned with the density matrix , we are only involved in the @xmath26 sector , as made explicit in the matrix elements written in eq.[uu1 ] . in a first class of eigenstates",
    "the particles are separated and do not propagate , since the hopping term acts only on doubly - occupied sites , i.e. on pure states of the form @xmath27 .",
    "let us denote such eigenstates as localized .",
    "a second class is given by plane wave superpositions ( magnons ) of doubly - occupied sites ( in the case of homogeneous disorder ) :",
    "@xmath28    with eigenvalues : @xmath29\\ ] ]    the site transition probability is then decomposed in plane wave contributions : @xmath30.\\ ] ]    the magnons are insensitive to any site potential : this rather unintuitive result depends on the delta - correlation of the hopping amplitudes as shown in appendix a3 .",
    "hence , with time - independent correlators and hermitean disorder , the liouvillian reduces to a lattice laplacian : it is no surprise then that diffusive ( long range order ) modes are the outcome of averaging over fast time - fluctuations . if the disorder has an antihermitean part , hopping rates locally break space inversion invariance , and make some diffusive modes unstable .",
    "in fact , the spectrum of the liouvillian is no longer positive definite : from the minus sign in the exponent in eq .",
    "[ ff ] , one has that the portion of the brillouin zone inside the surface @xmath31 becomes unstable .",
    "let us comment on the connection with the problem of a d=2 particle in a magnetic field .",
    "in two dimensions , a fluctuating magnetic field orthogonal to the plane would be described by an hopping coefficient of the form : @xmath32 with @xmath33 gaussian ; in our model instead @xmath34 is gaussian . in spite of this major difference",
    ", the present solution confirms a previous result on the motion in a fluctuating magnetic field , obtained in the continuum case @xcite .",
    "the effective motion of the quantum particle is in both cases classical diffusion .",
    "we are not able to understand wether this is a mere coincidence or is related with some general property shared by both approaches .",
    "we add now a deterministic asymmetric hopping , which describes a biased transport in a preferred direction@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian , for the particle - antiparticle system , becomes : @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\sum_{x,\\mu}\\delta_{\\mu,\\overline{\\mu } } \\alpha [ exp(-k ) { \\hat b}^{+}(x+e_{\\mu})\\cdot { \\hat b}(x)+exp(k ) { \\hat b}^{+}(x)\\cdot { \\hat b}(x+e_{\\mu})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are real .",
    "since in the perturbative series one can isolate the deterministic term and expand in the disorder term ( see appendix a1 ) , the total effective liouvillian @xmath38 is simply : @xmath39,where @xmath15 is given in eq .",
    "if we consider homogeneous hopping disorder , we recover a non - hermitean version of the so - called pair hopping model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "notice that here the pair hopping term is intrinsically dissipative .",
    "neither the magnons nor the eigenstates of the bias term ( free - particle states ) are eigenstates .",
    "it is nonetheless possible to determine two families of solutions , which can be regarded as the natural extension of the previously determined ones ( localized and diffusive , respectively ) .",
    "the wave function @xmath40 , in the two - particle sector @xmath41 , satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath42 \\\\ + & i & \\sum_{\\mu}{d_{+}(\\mu ) \\delta_{x , y } [ f(x+e_{\\mu},y+e_{\\mu})+f(x - e_{\\mu},y - e_{\\mu})]-2 d_{-}(\\mu)f(x , y)}=\\mathcal{e } \\cdot f(x , y),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , with respect to the previous section s notation , we have @xmath43 . since the pair - hopping term vanishes on singly - occupied sites , two - particle states , separated in every other direction but the bias one , will only be acted by the single hopping term .",
    "this first class of solutions is the obvious extension of the formerly localized ones . in the second class",
    "there is no longer separation orthogonal to the bias .",
    "let us proceed to the details of the solution .",
    "upon writing @xmath44 as a function of the baricentric coordinate @xmath45 and of the relative coordinate @xmath46 , one easily identifies the eigenspace @xmath47 , which can be spanned in terms of the eigenfunctions : @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are(d-1)-dimensional vectors , playing the role of degeneracy indexes .",
    "they are the projection of the baricentric and relative coordinates on the space @xmath50 , orthogonal to the bias .",
    "the eigenvalues then , up to a constant , coincide with the eigenvalues of @xmath51 : @xmath52   \\cdot   sin [ q_{\\overline{\\mu } } ] -2i \\sum_{\\mu}d_{-}(\\mu).\\ ] ]    one verifies that @xmath47 is eigenspace also upon adding a static disordered potential @xmath53 . spectrum and eigenfunctions will then reproduce the features discussed by hatano and nelson @xcite . to go over to the second class of solutions we first fourier transform the equation : @xmath54 + 2 \\alpha\\cdot   cos[(p/2 + q)_{\\overline{\\mu } } -ik])f(p , q)=\\\\ = -2i \\sum_{\\mu}d_{-}(\\mu)f(p , q ) + 2i \\sum_{\\mu}d_{+}(\\mu)cos ( p_{\\mu } ) { 1 \\over ( 2\\pi)^{d } }   \\int_{-\\pi}^{+\\pi } d \\overline{q } f(p,\\overline{q})\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after integrating over @xmath55 ,",

    "the function @xmath44 is divergent as @xmath67 , but when computing the transition probability between two sites one only needs @xmath68 both in @xmath44 and in the solution of the transpose equation .",
    "we finally examine the case with @xmath69 lying on the unit circle .",
    "the condition @xmath70 implies @xmath71 real , with absolute value smaller than one : this is verified only in the absence of asymmetry in the deterministic term ( @xmath72 ) , or when @xmath73 .",

[ spectrum ] ) in d=2 , with bias in the @xmath79 direction , and with hermitean , isotropic disorder ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) , is exhibited in the figures .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath82 of @xmath78 describes the reversible motion , with drift velocity @xmath83 .",
    "the real part @xmath84 describes the irreversible motion : for @xmath85 a region of instability at the center of the brillouin zone appears .",
    "when @xmath86 is small enough , i.e. when disorder dominates , drift is found along the bragg lines @xmath87 ( see fig.1 ) ; out of such lines @xmath82 is practically zero and the exciton predominantly undergoes diffusion . upon increasing @xmath37 , the bias exponent @xmath36 tilts the plane @xmath82 in the @xmath88 direction , thus enforcing the drift also at the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "this is exibited in fig.2 at very strong bias ( @xmath36 large ) one would expect the single - sided hopping to dominate .",
    "the situation is rather different ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "one easily verifies that @xmath89 \\cdot ( \\alpha \\cdot exp(k ) ) \\cdot   ( cos(p_{1}/2 ) + i \\cdot sin(p_{1}/2)$ ] , where the last factor is indeed the eigenvalue of the bias operator in the single - sided hopping limit .",
    "the effect of disorder is in the first factor : an abrupt change in sign of both the dissipative and reversible part of the spectrum ay the bragg lines .",
    "let us finally discuss the case @xmath90 , which describes a particle with deterministic anisotropic diffusion plus disorder . on qualitative grounds , everything goes as in fig.1 , but now @xmath84 is always positive ( no instability occurs ) .",
    "reversible and irreversible motion are now completely separated , in dependence on @xmath91 . around the bragg lines ,",
    "we have only drift , apart from a constant damping factor ; in the complementary region we find pure diffusion , with @xmath92 ( no drift ) .",
    "the drift region tends to broaden as @xmath37 is increased .",
    "we have discussed the motion of a particle over a lattice with fastly fluctuating hopping amplitudes : the model describes a massive quantum object coupled with a high temperature background . in our formalism the transition probability is written as a transition amplitude for a two - particle quantum system .",
    "this makes simpler the operation of averaging the probability over classical fluctuations . before averaging ,",
    "the two particles evolve independently , respectively forward and backward in time ; after averaging , they interact and their motion becomes irreversible .",
    "their effective hamiltonian , which is simply the liouvillian of the density matrix for the original system , has a quartic interaction , which can be readily put in the form of an heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "we determined the steady states of the liouvillian : with them one computes the density matrix and any single - particle transition probability ( see eqs.1,8 ) .",
    "a first class of steady states has the two particles physically separated and localized .",
    "the site transition probability depends on double occupancy states : it is a sum of plane waves , evolving in time with a diffusive law .",
    "the generic behavior of such quantum systems is then diffusion , and this holds true even in the presence of a disordered potential , as shown in appendix 3 : since the hopping amplitudes are delta - correlated in time , they destroy the phase coherence of the wave function .",
    "quantum interference effects , essential for localization , are thus absent .",
    "diffusion in a quantum - mechanical system was found in the harper model at its critical point @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the present result , obtained from a lattice model , confirms a previous one , on the motion of a particle in a rapidly fluctuating magnetic field , derived in the continuum case @xcite , . in section 3",
    "we added a deterministic , anisotropic bias , enforcing a favoured orientation along a given direction ; as already illustrated , this term arises quite naturally in describing tilted vortex motion in superconductors .",
    "the liouvillian takes then the form of the so - called pair - hopping model hamiltonian ( i.e. it includes both single - particle and pair hopping , and the two terms do not commute ) . in our context",
    "the coupling constants are complex , since we are mixing reversible and irreversible motion .",
    "two classes of steady states can be found . in the first class",
    "the two particles do not interact , provided that their wave packets do not overlap in the plane orthogonal to the bias . on such states the hopping disorder has practically no effect , and the interesting physics is the depinning transition , as described by hatano and nelson . in the second class the two particles form an exciton , extended along the bias direction .",
    "the dispersion law is a nontrivial function of the exciton momentum . for small enough bias ,",
    "the brillouin zone splits into a diffusion - dominated and a drift - dominated part , the latter lying around the bragg lines .",
    "the site transition probability , which adds over the the exciton contributions , is the sum of two parts : essentially reversible evolution around the bragg lines , and irreversible diffusion with no drift in the complementary region .",
    "notice that this is different from a mere sum of the two types of motion , since the separation involves different regions of momenta .",
    "for very large bias the dispersion law reduces to the one - way hopping form @xmath93 , but multiplied by the sign of @xmath94 : this is the signature of the hopping disorder , which translates into a singular behavior along the bragg lines .",
    "it is seen then that a perturbative approach fails also in the extremal regimes .",
    "we first point out here a relevant property of gaussian averages of time - ordered exponential operators , holding for perturbations delta - correlated in time .",
    "let us consider the operator @xmath95 , where the perturbation term is given through its correlator @xmath96 .",
    "one has , by definition : @xmath97   = \\sum_{l=0,p=\\pm}^{\\infty}p^{l}\\int_{t_{l+1}=t ' } \\big [ \\prod_{m=1}^{l } dt_{m}\\cdot \\theta(p(t_{m}-t_{m+1 } ) ) \\cdot { \\hat h}(t_{m})\\big]\\cdot \\theta(p(t - t_{1}))\\ ] ] the average leads to : @xmath98 > & = & texp\\big[\\int_{t'}^{t } d \\tau \\cdot [ { \\hat h}_{0}(\\tau ) + sign(t - t')\\cdot { \\hat v}_{eff}(\\tau)]\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ < { \\hat v}(t)\\cdot { \\hat v}(t')>&=&2\\cdot \\delta(t - t ' ) \\cdot { \\hat v}_{eff}(t)\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the calculation of the averaged transition probability ( eq . [ u2 ] ) , in the hermitean case , can be performed also by means of an exact resummation of ladder diagrams ; the probability then coincides with the diffuson amplitude .",
    "the retarded and advanced green s functions are : @xmath99\\cdot { \\hat g}^{\\pm}(t , t ' )   & = & \\delta(t - t')\\nonumber\\\\ { \\hat g}^{\\pm}(t , t')&= & \\pm i \\theta(\\pm(t - t'))\\cdot { \\hat u}(t , t')\\nonumber\\\\ { \\hat g}^{+}(t , t')&=&[{\\hat g}^{-}(t',t)]^{+}\\nonumber\\\\     the @xmath8 operator is performed first , obtaining an effective single particle generator @xmath100 : @xmath101 \\nonumber\\\\ { \\hat h}_{eff}(t)&= & \\sum_{\\mu , x}d(\\mu;t)|x><x|\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us consider now the perturbative expansion for the average of @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the perturbation .",
    "one can show that the expansion can be written as the sum of particle - antiparticle diagrams where the free propagator lines are substituted with the exact averaged green s functions @xmath104 , and the contractions are made only between particle and antiparticle disorder vertices .",
    "in fact , when contracting particle - particle vertices one is computing contributions to the averaged propagator .",
    "due to causality and to delta correlation in time , crossed diagrams are zero ; one is left with the sum of ladder diagrams , i.e. only the diffuson survives . the basic contribution to the ladder",
