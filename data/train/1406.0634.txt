    "this offers a picture of how lorentz contraction is attained in a physically realistic setting .",

    "this situation is dual to that of a semi - infinite rod colliding with an unmovable wall ( section  [ section1 ] ) , and a similar analysis leads to the initial - boundary value problem @xmath121 whose solution is @xmath122 the worldlines of the particles in the string ( level sets of @xmath3 ) are depicted in figure  [ pull ] .",

    "this is a simplified instance of the celebrated bell paradox @xcite , where two identical spaceships connected by a string start moving simultaneously with the same acceleration profile , thus keeping their separation distance constant .",
    "the ( apparent ) paradox is that the string will stretch , unlike what may be expected at first sight . in the spaceships initial rest frame , this is because it must compensate the decrease in length due to lorentz contraction ; in the spaceships final rest frame , this is because the spaceship at the rear is still moving backwards when the spaceship at the front stops moving .",
    "figure  [ bell2 ] , however , shows that things are not so simple ( at least for this model ) : the string initially becomes stretched at the front and compressed at the rear , until it reaches a state where it is half stretched and half compressed , and is never completely stretched .",
    "moreover , the periodicity of its motion guarantees that it eventually becomes momentarily relaxed and at rest in the spaceships initial rest frame .",

    "the velocity of the points in the rod is piecewise constant and jumps discontinuously ( by small increments under ordinary conditions ) as compression and rarefaction waves reflect back and forth along the rod at the speed of light .",
    "an even more complicated pattern of compression and rarefaction waves occurs when the endpoints of a rigid string are simultaneously set in motion ( which can be seen as a particular case of bell s spaceships paradox ) . in this case , unlike what might be expected , the string is never completely stretched , and in fact it even becomes momentarily relaxed .",
    "finally , we analyzed a radial rigid string that had partially crossed the event horizon of a schwarzschild black hole while still being held from the outside .",
