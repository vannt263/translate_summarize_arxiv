    "multiplex networks are tools for modeling networked systems in which units have heterogeneous types of interaction , making them members of distinct networks simultaneously .",
    "the multiplex framework envisages different layers to model different types of relationships between the same set of nodes .",
    "for example , we can take a sample of individuals and constitute a social media layer , in which links represent interaction on social media , a kinship layer , a geographical proximity layer , and so on .",
    "examples of real systems that have been conceptualized so far using the multiplex framework include citation networks , online social media , airline networks , scientific collaboration networks , and online games  @xcite",
    ".    theoretical analysis of multiplex networks was initiated by the seminal papers  @xcite that invented and introduced theoretical measures for quantifying multiplex networks .",
    "consequently , multiplex networks were utilized for the theoretical study of phenomena such as epidemics  @xcite , pathogen - awareness interplay  @xcite , percolation processes  @xcite , evolution of cooperation  @xcite , diffusion processes  @xcite and social contagion  @xcite . for a thorough review ,",
    "see  @xcite .    in the present paper we focus on the problem of growing multiplex networks . in  @xcite , the case where two layers are homogeneously growing ( that is , the number of links that each newly - born node establishes is the same for both layers ) according to preferential attachment",
    "is considered , and it is shown that @xmath1 ( which is the average layer-2 degree of nodes whose layer-1 degree is @xmath0 ) is a function of @xmath0 .",
    "previous results on growing multiplex networks are confined to homogeneously - growing layers  @xcite . in the present paper , we consider heterogeneously - growing layers : each incoming node establishes @xmath2 links in layer 1 and @xmath3 links in layer 2 .",
    "we also solve the problem for the case where growth is uniform , rather than preferential .",
    "we demonstrate that , surprisingly , the expression for @xmath1 is identical to that of the preferential case .",
    "we verify the theoretical findings with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the two - layer multiplex network we consider in the present paper possesses one set of nodes and two distinct sets of links .",
    "the network comprises two layers , corresponding to the two sets of links .",
    "each node resides in both layers .",
    "the degree of node @xmath4 in layer 1 is denoted by @xmath5 , and its degree in layer 2 is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the number of nodes at time @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 and the number of links at layer @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the number of nodes that have degrees @xmath0 and @xmath12 at time @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the fraction of these nodes by @xmath13 .",
    "each incoming node establishes @xmath2 links in layer 1 and @xmath3 links in layer 2 .    at the inception",
    ", there are @xmath14 links in the first layer and @xmath15 links in the second layer .",
    "the network grows by the successive addition of new nodes .",
    "each node establishes @xmath16 links in each layer .",
    "so the number of links in layer @xmath9 at time @xmath7 is @xmath17 .",
    "in the first model , incoming nodes choose their destinations according to the preferential attachment mechanism posited in  @xcite .",
    "the probability that an existing node ( call it @xmath4 ) receives a layer-1 link from the newly - born node is proportional to @xmath18 , and similarly , the probability for it to receive a layer-2 link is proportional to @xmath19 . note that to obtain the normalized link - reception probabilities at time @xmath7 , the former should be divided by @xmath20 and the latter should be divided by @xmath21the number of links in the first and second layers , respectively .",
    "the addition of a new node at time @xmath7 can alter the values of @xmath22 . if a node with layer-1 degree @xmath23 and layer-2 degree @xmath12 receives a layer-1 link , its layer-1 degree increments to @xmath0 , and @xmath24 increments as a consequence .",
    "if a node with layer-1 degree @xmath0 and layer-2 degree @xmath25 receives a link , its layer-2 degree increments and consequently , @xmath22 increments .",
    "there are two events which would result in a decrease in @xmath22 : if a node with layer-1 degree @xmath0 and layer-2 degree @xmath12 receives a link in either layer .",
    "finally , each incoming node has an initial layer-1 degree and layer-2 degree of @xmath26 , and increments @xmath27 when it is introduced .",
    "the following rate equation quantifies the evolution of the expected value of @xmath28 upon the introduction of a single node by addressing the aforementioned events with their corresponding probabilities of occurrence : @xmath29    alternatively , we can write the rate equation for @xmath30 . using the substitution @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath32",

    "the solution is @xmath38    this is depicted in figure  [ fig_3 ] . as a measure of correlation between the two layers ,",
    "we find the average layer-2 degree of the nodes whose layer-1 degree is @xmath0 .",
    "let us denote this quantity by @xmath39 . to calculate @xmath39",
    ", we need to perform the following summation : @xmath40    in appendix  [ app : nk_1 ] , we perform this summation .",
    "the answer is @xmath41 in the special case of @xmath42 , this reduces to @xmath43 , which is consistent with the previous result in the literature  @xcite .",
    "note that   if we take the expected value of  , we obtain @xmath44 which coincides with the mean degree in layer 2 .",
    "now let us analyze how adding a layer affects inequality in degrees .",
    "we ask , what is the probability that a node has higher degree in layer 2 than in layer 1 ( on average ) ?",
    "that is , we seek @xmath45 . analyzing the inequality @xmath46 , we observe that if @xmath47 , then for every @xmath0 the inequality holds , if @xmath48 , then @xmath0 must be less than @xmath49 .",
    "so a node with degree below @xmath50 is on average more connected in layer 2 than in layer 1 .",
    "note that since the minimum degree in layer 1 is @xmath2 , we should impose an additional constraint on @xmath50 , namely , @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to @xmath52 . since @xmath2 and @xmath3 can only take integer values , since yields @xmath47 .",
    "so in order for a node with degree @xmath0 to have greater expected degree in layer 2 than its given degree in layer 1 , first we should have @xmath47 , and second , @xmath53 . in short , there are three distinct cases to discern : * ( a ) * if @xmath48 , the inequality holds for all @xmath0 , that is , on average , every node is more connected in layer 2 than in layer 1 . * ( b ) * if @xmath54 , then the inequality never holds .",
    "that is , everyone is on average more connected in layer 1 . *",
    "( c ) * if @xmath42 , then for nodes whose degree in layer 1 is smaller than @xmath55 ( which coincides with @xmath56 ) , the inequality holds , and for others it does not .",
    "so in the case of homogeneous growth , nodes whose degree in one layer is below the mean degree are on average more connected in the other layer , and nodes with degree higher @xmath55 are on average less connected in the other layer .",
    "these three cases are depicted in figure  [ fig_4 ] .",
    "the purple area pertains to case ( a ) , where curves are @xmath1 are always below @xmath0 , regardless of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the green area corresponds to case ( c ) , where @xmath0 is always above @xmath1 .",
