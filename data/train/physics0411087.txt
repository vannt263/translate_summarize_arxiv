    "the change with time in the size of the interval between two consecutive heartbeats is called heart rate variability ( hrv )",
    ". there are many ( not necessarily independent ) sources of hrv in people  @xcite@xcite , but the variations are largely controlled by the autonomic nervous system through the action of both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic branches , while the main mechanical influences are respiration and blood pressure .    it has been found that long  term hrv shows @xmath0 noise  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is found in many dynamical systems and draw attention to long  term hrv . the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa )",
    "was introduced by peng et al .",
    "@xcite to study the long  range correlations found in hrv  @xcite . a cross  over was identified around a scale of 10 beats in all healthy subjects , signalling a change of dynamics when going from short to long time scales .",
    "since then dfa has been used to characterise hrv in healthy conditions and in the presence of heart disease  @xcite@xcite .",
    "another promising approach is the analysis of hrv using wavelets , which is a mathematical technique specifically suited to analyse non  stationary series .",
    "the wavelet transform extracts the cumulative amplitudes of fluctuations of data at each point in time for a given scale  @xcite .",
    "ivanov et al .",
    "@xcite presented the cumulative variation amplitude analysis ( cvaa ) , where the inter  beat series were treated with consecutive wavelet and hilbert transforms and an instantaneous amplitude is assigned to each inter  beat interval .",
    "it was found that the same gamma distribution describes the distributions of instantaneous amplitudes at all scales and for all the healthy subjects in the study .",
    "further studies using wavelets on long  term recordings have explored the possibility to define methods which could be used as markers of heart disease  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the dfa and cvaa results suggest that there are intrinsic unknown dynamics underlying the long  term behaviour of the healthy human heart .",
    "it has been shown by hausdorff and peng  @xcite that it is extremely unlikely that the emergence of these complex patterns is due to having a system of many different independent influences each with their own timescale .",
    "the question of the origin of the universal long  term behaviour of hrv remains open .    in this article we present dfa and cvaa studies of long  term hrv in the eastern oyster in conditions resembling those of their natural habitat  @xcite . in the first section ,",
    "the circulatory system of the oyster is briefly described .",
    "the basic components of the system designed for the monitoring and acquisition of the heartbeat data are also presented . in the second section ,",
    "the mathematical principles of dfa and cvaa are reviewed and then applied to the analysis of the oyster s heartbeat data . in the last section , the conclusions and some general remarks are given .",
    "the eastern oyster is a fairly well studied mollusk  @xcite which lives in coastal waters and lagoons from canada to mexico .",
    "it has an open circulatory system , i.e. , the blood moves not only in the arteries and veins but also throughout the tissues .",
    "there are two accessory hearts which beat a couple of times per minute , independently from the principal heart .",
    "the main heart has three chambers .",
    "the two auricles receive the blood from the gills and send it , about half a second later , to the ventricle .",
    "the automatism of the heart is of a diffuse nature and contractions originate at any point of the ventricle .",
    "contractions are not induced by impulses from the central nervous system and it is not known if there are any localised pacemakers .",
    "two types of vesicles are found in the nerve endings of the myocardium , but it is not clear if they correspond to a rudimentary version of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems  @xcite .",
    "the main external influences on the heart rhythm are the temperature , the level of oxygen and the salinity of water , while the main mechanical influences are the movement of the shell valves and the gills .",
    "when compared with people there is a factor of hundred in the size of the hearts , the period of respiration in the eastern oyster is two to three times longer and the heart beats about two times slower .",
    "the heartbeat receives perturbations from the shell valves and from the accessory hearts , which are not present in the case of the human heart . in summary",
    "all the suspected leading causes of the variability of the heart rate in people are not present or are quite different in the case of the eastern oyster .      the experimental set ",
    "up was composed of a low  power laser diode , a fibre optic bundle , a photo  diode and the data acquisition and monitoring systems  @xcite .",
    "we have used a laser diode of 4 mw and 632 nm .",
    "the radius of the laser beam was 1 mm . the fibre optic bundle had a length of 1.3 m and a cross section of 38 mm@xmath1 with a transmittance of approximately 60 percent at this wavelength .",
    "the active size of the eg&g judson j165sp  r03m  sc germanium photo ",
    "diode was 3x3 mm@xmath1 .",
    "the voltage signal was recorded with an at  mio 16 data acquisition card connected through a bnc2080 multiple channel interface board .",
    "the system was controlled with a labview program written by us .",
    "a sketch of the technique is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "we have studied a set of six oysters with a uniform size of 7 cm and with a relatively thin section of the shell on top of the heart .",
    "some of the oysters were measured several times , having as a result a set of 15 time series .",
    "there were at least 12 hours between measurements on the same mollusk .",
    "the oysters were kept in a big water tank under conditions resembling those of their natural habitat .",
    "a short time before the measurements , they were transfered to a small recipient on the focus of the optical set up .",
    "a system of pumps kept the water circulating and passing through other containers where the water was filtered and where the salinity , and temperature were controlled .",
    "the analyses shown below were performed on each of the inter  beat time series of the oyster s heartbeat .",
    "the laser light was pointed onto the beating heart .",
    "the intensity of the reflected light increases as the thickness of the walls increases in each systole of the ventricle .",
    "hence , the inter  beat of a cardiac signal measured with our laser technique corresponds to the time between two consecutive peaks ( see fig .",
    "1b ) . the monitored signals of the oyster s heartbeat are : i ) highly non  stationary , ii ) non periodic , and iii ) irregular .",
    "further physiological perturbations on the cardiac signals such as gills and valves movements are clearly identified in the long  term .",
    "this set of special characteristics of our cardiac signals exclude the application of algorithms currently used to calculate the inter  beats in ecgs of humans .",
    "the most popular , are based on the qrs complex identification  @xcite , which does not apply to the cardiac signals from the oyster .    to find the inter ",
    "beat intervals produced by the systole we have used the following method ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : ( i ) a set of boxes of the same width @xmath2 is used to find the maximum in each interval .",
    "( ii ) a secondary box of width @xmath3 centred at the limit of two contiguous boxes is used as a range of confidence because the inter  beat period is not constant .",
    "( iii ) the value of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are fixed visually such that the efficiency for finding the peaks is optimal .",
    "( iv ) furthermore , after the calculation of the inter  beat intervals ,",
    "the outliers are filtered with a similar procedure as suggested in ref .",
    "we obtained as a result of applying the algorithm , 15 time series with lengths varying from 10403 to 25802 inter  beats .",
    "the detrended fluctuation analysis is a technique that permits to identify long  range correlations in non  stationary time series . as commented in ref .",
    "@xcite , dfa has been applied to the study of a broad range of systems , such as the human gait , dna sequences , the heartbeat dynamics , the weather , and even in economics .",
    "specially , in the analysis of natural inter  beat heartbeat fluctuation , dfa has helped to discriminate healthy from heart diseased humans .",
    "it has provided also , a quantitative difference between old and young people .",
    "several works show the robustness of dfa , although improvements are still being done  @xcite .",
    "dfa is a simple yet powerful tool for studying physiological data .",
    "the dfa is as follows  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be a time series .",
    "then ( i ) integrate @xmath4 , ( ii ) divide the time series in @xmath5 equal amplitude intervals , ( iii ) in each box of width @xmath5 do a polynomial fit of order @xmath6 ( it defines dfa@xmath6 analysis ) : @xmath7 , ( iv ) eliminate the polynomial trend in each box , ( v ) calculate the root mean squared fluctuation @xmath8 as a function of the @xmath5 intervals , and ( vi ) do steps ( i)(v ) for several box widths to find the functional relation between @xmath9 and @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of scaling in the original signal produces a straight line in a double log plot of @xmath9 versus @xmath5 .",
    "if the slope , @xmath10 , is 0.5 , the data is uncorrelated and corresponds to a random walk  @xcite . a slope between 0.5 and 1 signals the presence of a long  range power law , where @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath0 noise  @xcite .",
    "for a slope bigger than 1 , the correlations no longer correspond to a power law .",
    "a value of 1.5 indicates brownian noise  @xcite .",
    "healthy people have a slope of 1.5 for values of @xmath5 less than 10 beats , and a slope of 1 for time scales between 100 and 10000 beats  @xcite .    using dfa1 we found ( fig .",
    "3 ) that all the oysters in our study present @xmath0 noise behaviour for scales above @xmath12 , corresponding to @xmath13 beats .",
    "the average slope in this region is @xmath14 where the error is the standard deviation of all the samples . for shorter time scales , between 10 and 100 beats ,",
    "a slope @xmath15 is found .",
    "the slope at even shorter scales ( @xmath16 ) is also close to 1 in all cases , but the dfa method has potentially large intrinsic systematic effects in this range  @xcite , making it difficult to extract reliable information .",
    "we found the same variation in the results from measurement to measurement when comparing different sets from the same oyster and sets of data from different oysters ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the respiration and the accessory hearts have independent oscillations with periods around 20 to 40 beats . in contrast , the shell valves present intermittent activity but , when active , the period is also in the 2030 beats range .",
    "these complex perturbations on the oyster s heartbeat could be the source of the @xmath17 slope at short time scales  @xcite . to discard the possibility that polynomial trends could be the source of the cross  over  @xcite obtained in this work , we performed analyses of oyster s heartbeat using dfa@xmath6 for @xmath18 , and found in each case a cross  over approximately in the same region indicated by dfa1 , although @xmath19 decreased down to 20% while @xmath17 keeping its same value .",
    "we also analysed our measurements using cvaa .",
    "this technique that is based on consecutive wavelet and hilbert transforms was applied for the first time in the study of natural heartbeat fluctuation .",
    "it was found that a common gamma distribution characterises a group of healthy people . on the other hand , in the case of a group of people suffering sleep apnea",
    ", it was found that such data collapse does not happens .",
    "even more , in some cases it was not possible to get a gamma distribution  @xcite . in general , a gamma distribution is characteristic of physical systems out of equilibrium .",
    "hence , the results previously commented suggest that the heartbeat in healthy people owns an intrinsic underlying dynamics .",
    "mathematically , cvaa consists of the next steps : ( i ) choose adequate scales to analyse the data , ( ii ) from the original series , a set of /eries each at a different scale is obtained using a continuous wavelet transform .",
    "there are many wavelet families to choose to perform this step and several have been tried .",
    "each family eliminates local polynomial trends from the signal in a different way .",
    "the coefficients @xmath20 of the wavelet transformation in each scale reflect the cumulative variation of the signal .",
    "( iii ) then , each of the new time series is processed with a hilbert transform to extract the instantaneous amplitudes @xmath21 of the variations at each point in the series .",
    "( iv ) construct the time series @xmath22 and calculate the amplitudes @xmath23 , ( v ) finally , the histogram of these amplitudes is normalised to 1 to form a probability distribution , @xmath24 , which is then re - scaled such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "remarkably , we found that each distribution of instantaneous amplitudes is fitted by a gamma distribution  @xcite ( fig .",
    "4a ) . furthermore , as in the case of healthy people , the distributions for all the oysters in the study are well described by the same gamma distribution ( fig .",
    "4b ) , i.e. , there is a common parameter @xmath27  @xcite which describes the normalised distribution of instantaneous amplitudes from any oyster .",
    "this behaviour is found at scales @xmath28 and for all the wavelets analysed  @xcite : daubechies ( moments 310 ) , gaussian ( moments 310 ) , meyer , morlet , and b  spline biorthogonals ( decomposition moments 1 and 3 ) .",
    "the results obtained for the parameters of the gamma distributions were all very similar . as an example of the robustness of our results , in table 2",
    "are shown the values of the parameters of the fits to the gamma distributions performed with orthogonal , biorthogonal , and non  orthogonal wavelets .",
    "the numerical value for the @xmath27 parameter in the eastern oyster is @xmath29 which is slightly lower than the value of @xmath30 found for healthy people during sleep hours by ivanov et al . using gaussian wavelets  @xcite .",
    "using the dfa and cvaa methods we find long  range correlations and scaling in the long  term hrv of the eastern oyster .",
    "dfa shows @xmath0 noise behaviour at large scales and a cross  over to a smaller slope for scales of the order of 300 beats for all oysters in the study .",
    "the cross  over happens at a scale well above the region where dfa presents some bias .",
    "the source of the cross  over seems to be the result of the complex interactions between the components of the circulatory system of the eastern oyster .",
    "models of this phenomena such as polynomial trends added linearly to a correlated signal do not seem to apply to the case of the eastern oyster .",
    "with cvaa we find that all oyster records collapse to a gamma distribution with the same numerical value of the @xmath27 parameter , @xmath31 , for a wide variety of wavelets and scales .",
    "these results are remarkably similar to those previously reported in the study of healthy people , in spite of the fact that the circulatory system of the eastern oyster and the influences it is exposed to are dramatically different from those in the case of people , pointing thus to an intrinsic origin of these complex patterns .",
    "characterisations of long  term hrv are promising candidates for clinical prognostic tools making it vital to understand its origin in order to exploit fully this type of techniques .",
    "our results pose stringent constrains and offer new hints and challenges to models attempting to describe the long  term dynamics of the heart .",
    "we thank d. vera and j. bante for their technical assistance and g. oskam for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by conacyt grant 28387e .",

    "the stars show the peaks found by our algorithm .",
    "this is a schematic representation of the way our algorithm for finding heartbeat peaks works .",
