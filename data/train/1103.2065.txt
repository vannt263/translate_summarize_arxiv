    "in particular , there usually is no need to invoke quark degrees of freedom to understand their internal structures since the internal dynamics of baryons can be described very well in terms of baryonic and mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "one very successful , quite fundamental way of dealing with these degrees of freedom is the effective field - theory framework of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",

    "one usually must rely on effective lagrangian formulations that offer a more direct avenue to the actual meson and baryon degrees of freedom that manifest themselves in the experiments .",
    "it is important , therefore , to understand the nature of the electromagnetic interaction with mesons and baryons in a more detailed picture .",

    "we will show here how this formalism can be reformulated equivalently in a manner that makes it directly amenable to physically motivated approximation schemes , thus rendering the approach practically manageable . of decisive importance in this respect will be the fact that the internal dressing effects of the nucleon current and the dynamics of pion photoproduction are very closely related .",

    "in addition , to ensure microscopic consistency among all associated reaction mechanisms , we suggest to approximate @xmath90 similar to what was discussed for photoproduction in sec .  [ sec : makegip ] . for the present application to the nucleon current ,",
    "however , we also must make sure that the current reproduces the anomalous magnetic moments for its on - shell matrix element [ cf.eq .",
    "( [ eq : jmudirpau ] ) ] .",

    "ensure that @xmath133 is dimensionless . in practice",
    ", the actual on - shell matrix elements of the nucleon current usually never enter the calculations , and one may then use @xmath133 as an additional fit parameter that accounts for the current being partially off - shell . as an example of such a case",
    ", we discuss pion photoproduction in the following section .      inserting the ( exact ) nucleon current ( [ eq : ncurrent3 ] ) into the @xmath16-channel term of the photoproduction current ( [ eq : mmusplit1 ] ) and using the splitting ( [ eq : txsplit ] ) of @xmath14 into its pole and non - pole contributions",
    ", we immediately find @xmath134 which expresses the final - state interaction in terms of the full @xmath15 @xmath14 matrix instead of just its non - polar part @xmath17 .",
    "this equation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwithbox](b ) .",
    "this reformulation is exact if neither @xmath130 nor @xmath90 are approximated . in practice",
    ", however , one employs the approximations ( [ eq : jmuphen ] ) and ( [ eq : wticontactamended ] ) to render the equations manageable .",
    "the corresponding calculations of pion photoproduction are already underway  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this reformulation is twofold .",
    "first , undesirable numerical artifacts that may arise from the _ non - unique _ splitting of @xmath14 into its pole part and @xmath17 can be avoided since @xmath14 is closer to the actual observables than @xmath17 . and second , and most importantly , the expression ( [ eq : mmut ] ) only requires the half on - shell expression of @xmath135 for which we can employ the result ( [ eq : jsronshellj ] ) when we make the approximation @xmath136 . in actual calculations , one may then use the two coefficient functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 appearing in the auxiliary currents of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : auxcurrent ] ) as fit parameters , which is an excellent approximation of the dressing effects inherent in the product @xmath139 when taken half on - shell .",
    "this assertion is corroborated by the preliminary numerical results of ref .",
    "based on the field - theory approach of haberzettl  @xcite , we have presented here a formulation of the dressed electromagnetic current of the nucleon that is microscopically consistent with the reaction mechanisms inherent in meson photoproduction . the goal was to equivalently rewrite the original expressions of the full formalism in a manner that retains as much as possible of its original dynamical structure while at the same time presenting options for meaningful approximations which in practice are necessary to render the equations manageable .",
    "the consistency requirement , in particular , led to a novel approximation scheme for pion photoproduction , different from what was proposed in ref .",
    "the resulting expressions are summarized diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwithbox ] for pion photoproduction and in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncurrentall ] for the dressed nucleon current .",
    "the full theory is exact .",
    "the guiding principle for the construction of the corresponding equations was the consistent and complete implementation of local gauge invariance at all levels of the reaction mechanisms in a manner that lends itself to transparent approximation schemes .",
    "in doing so we followed the basic strategy of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , with one important and essential difference . instead of choosing the optional transverse current @xmath86 as zero , as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we now choose it so that the resulting expression ( [ eq : ncurrent3 ] ) for the dressed nucleon current exhibits a clean separation of transverse and longitudinal contributions that makes it straightforward to implement a phenomenological description of the dressing effects which preserves gauge invariance through the use of the minimal current @xmath59 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jsdefined ] ) .",
    "the phenomenological use of @xmath59 for the nucleon current makes the description of pion photoproduction particularly simple when the fsi loop of the production current @xmath37 is written in terms of the full @xmath15 @xmath14 matrix ( instead of with its non - pole part @xmath17 ) because the resulting @xmath16-channel term ( [ eq : jsronshellj ] ) then admits a very simple approximation by utilizing the effective dressing functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 as two fit parameters .",
    "another obvious advantage of the present scheme is that for real photons , in particular , the effective structure of the resulting photoproduction current remains very close to the full formalism even if the loops over the five - point - current contributions @xmath82 are approximated with the phenomenological contact current of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wticontactamended ] ) since for real photons the longitudinal contributions that make up the structural difference between the currents @xmath37 of fig .",
    "[ fig : mcurrent ] and of fig .",
    "[ fig : mwithbox ] are irrelevant .    the approximations discussed here in detail concern replacing the current @xmath140 by the minimal current @xmath59 and the contact current @xmath90 of ( [ eq : mceq2 ] ) by the phenomenological gip expression ( [ eq : wticontactamended ] ) .",
    "it should be clear , however , that this still leaves a formidable self - consistency problem because , as can read off fig .",
    "[ fig : ncurrentall](a ) , the nucleon current @xmath1 also appears in one of the loops on the right - hand side . in practice , therefore , instead of solving this self - consistency problem iteratively , one might truncate it at the lowest level by employing the usual simplified on - shell expression ( [ eq : jmudirpau ] ) for the current in the loop .",
    "the obvious first application of the present dressing formalism for the nucleon current is pion photoproduction , of course , since it was the consistency requirement with this process that inspired the formalism in the first place .",
    "as mentioned , this application is underway already  @xcite , and the preliminary results obtained so far are very encouraging . in other words ,",
    "the present approach is not just formally correct but the approximations suggested by its formal structure indeed lead to an excellent description of the data .",
    "other possible applications include any process that may benefit from a detailed microscopic description of the nucleon current .",
    "obvious candidates are other meson production processes with both real and virtual photons off the nucleon , compton scattering off the nucleon , and @xmath141 bremsstrahlung . for virtual photons , in particular , the present formalism may also be helpful in extracting the functional behavior of electromagnetic form factors from the data .",
