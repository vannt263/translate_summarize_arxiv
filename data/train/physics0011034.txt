    "the synthesis of phase - coherent ( sub)harmonic optical radiation ( @xmath4 ) is useful in high precision optical measurements , such as optical frequency metrology @xcite , @xcite . in frequency metrology , a phase - coherent optical _ by - n _ divider allows to reduce the absolute measurement of an optical frequency @xmath5 ( e.g , couting cycles in the hundreds of thz range ) to the measurement of a smaller frequency interval @xmath6 by use of a femtosecond laser comb generator whose radio - frequency intermode spacing is phase - locked to a primary microwave clock @xcite",
    ". the generation of a comb of phase - locked harmonic radiation can also be the starting basis for the generation of attosecond pulse train by fourier synthesis @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "indeed , the superposition ( fourier synthesis@xcite,@xcite ) of a comb of _ n _ equal amplitude optical harmonic fields with a controllable relative phase relationship can lead to a temporal train of ultra - short pulses with a sub - optical cycle duration ( @xmath7 ) and a repetition rate equal to the fundamental harmonic @xmath1 .",
    "phase - locked optical harmonic generators are often based on many lasers linked via nonlinear upconversion parametric processes @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "phase coherence among the harmonic waves is usually achieved by use of complex electronic phase - locking loops .",
    "the high conversion efficiencies of optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) combined with the engineering flexibility offered by periodically poled ( pp ) nonlinear materials may allow a compact implementation of such optical subharmonic generators or attosecond pulse generator .",
    "the study of opos as by-@xmath8 dividers ( @xmath9 ) of a pump frequency @xmath10 is motivated by their capacity to perform the phase - coherent division of a pump photon into two highly phase - correlated subharmonic photons . in precision measurement setups ,",
    "subharmonic generation leads to a subsequent phase noise reduction ( @xmath11 ) compared to harmonic generation ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "graham and haken have first demonstrated that the phase sum @xmath13 of the idler and signal waves from an opo follows adiabatically the phase noise @xmath14 of the pump laser , while their phase difference @xmath15 undergoes a phase diffusion process stemming from the interaction of both modes with the vacuum fluctuations@xcite . to act as pertinent phase - coherent dividers ,",
    "the idler and signal waves have thus to be phase - locked , for instance by use of an electronic servo control that forces @xmath15 to copy the phase of an external rf oscillator referenced to a primary clock .",
    "such an electronic servo technique has been implemented to develop phase - coherent divide - by-2 ( 2:1)@xcite , and divide - by-3 ( 3:1 ) opos for high resolution optical metrology @xcite , @xcite with corresponding residual phase difference variance well below @xmath16 rad@xmath17 .",
    "electronic phase - locking loops are however subject to limited response time bandwidth and require fast opo cavity length actuators . as an alternative , all - optical self phase - locking ( spl )",
    "methods are currently being investigated @xcite,@xcite to by - pass the bandwidth limitation of electronic servos and simplify the implementation of phase - locked dividers .",
    "these methods are based on the self injection - locking of the subharmonic waves , similarly to the injection locking process of a slave laser oscillator by a master laser which possesses a better spectral purity and frequency stability @xcite,@xcite . in injection - locked systems ,",
    "the phase of the slave oscillator , @xmath18 , is a perfect copy of the phase of the injecting master oscillator .",
    "phase locking can occur only when the two frequencies are close enough , e.g. within a certain _ locking range _ @xmath19",
    "whose extent is proportional to the squared ratio @xmath20 of the injecting master power to the slave power .",
    "it is thus expected that the self - locking range in an opo divider should depend on whether the opo is configured as a doubly - resonant ( dro ) , a triply - resonant ( tro ) or a pump - enhanced singly resonant oscillator ( prsro ) .",
    "strong self injection - locking regime occurs only when the signal and idler waves are simultaneously resonant .    for divide - by-2 opos based on a type - i nonlinear process (",
    "the signal and idler are identically polarized ) , self - injection locking occurs naturally when the opo is tuned close enough to the frequency - degeneracy@xcite .",
    "recently a type - ii self phase - locked 2:1 dro was demonstrated , in which a small mixing of the two orthogonally polarized signal and idler waves , performed by an intracavity wave plate , induces the injection locking @xcite . in both cases",
    "the evidence of self phase locking was provided by the high level of phase - coherence between the frequency degenerate signal and idler waves . following the experiment in ref @xcite , the theory of _ linearly _ coupled type - ii 2:1 spl - dros has been reported@xcite . in the case of 3:1 opo dividers ,",
    "obviously such a linear coupling can not be implemented , and one must use a nonlinear coupling via @xmath21 cascading processes ( for instance by introducing inside the opo cavity a second nonlinear material phase - matched for the shg of the idler wave ) .",
    "the first implementation of such a self  phase - locked ( spl ) opo was recently reported , and used a dual - grating periodically poled lithium niobate chip carrying the opo and shg sections in a pump - resonant idler - resonant configuration ( prsro ) @xcite .",
    "an extremely small locking range of @xmath22500 khz , corresponding to a fraction of the idler cavity linewidth , was reported due to the weak ( non resonant ) doubled idler power .",
    "a different situation should occur when both the signal and idler waves are resonant , as in a dro or a tro .",
    "because of the enhanced energy flow exchange between the @xmath23 and @xmath1 modes , the dynamics of such a self - phase locked opo ( spl - opo ) is expected to differ significantly from that of a conventional opo .",
    "strictly speaking the 3:1 spl - dro or tro can be regarded as a degenerate sub / second harmonic generator ( @xmath24 ) internally pumped by the signal wave of a non - degenerate opo ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "while theories of opo devices containing additional up or down conversion of the signal and idler waves have been investigated in the past with the aim of generating new frequencies @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , or revealing the quantum noise signature of competing @xmath26 nonlinearities @xcite,@xcite such a subharmonically resonant configuration of competing nonlinearities in opos has never been theoretically investigated in detail . a 3:1 dro - shg rough rate equation analysis based on photon flux conservation , but neglecting the role of cavity detunings and field phase coherence , was previously given by zhang _",
    "et al _ @xcite with the conclusion that self - phase locking should manifest through an imbalance of the signal and idler intensities at exact 3:1 division .",
    "actually our in - depth analysis shows that such an imbalance holds only for zero detunings : when the nonlinear phase shift due to cascading is compensated by a non - zero optimal cavity detuning , one can obtain the same output intensities as in a conventional dro .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a detailed plane - wave description of the dynamics of divide - by-3 spl - opos that encompasses all the three cavity configurations ( only the main results are summarized in the conclusion for the prsro , which will be detailed elsewhere ) .",
    "the dynamics of the nonlinearly coupled opo is shown to differ substancially from the linear coupling case of a type - ii 2:1 spl - dro @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nonlinear coupling gives rise to a subcrital bifurcation for any non - zero cavity detuning while conventional opos undergo subcritical bifurcations only for the case of largely pump - detuned tros @xcite , @xcite . as a consequence of the nonlinear phase shifts due to the cascading processes , spl - dros or tros",
    "will be shown to display large - intensity stable stationary states that would correspond to non - lasing detuning domains in conventional opos , extending thus the phase - locking detuning range up to a few cavity linewidths .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the basic plane - wave ring cavity model leading to the meanfield solutions that will be compared with the full propagation solutions . in section iii , we first treat in detail the dro configuration case .",
    "we then extend the theory to the case of a tro in section iv .",
    "main results on the prsro configurations will be also summarized in the conclusion .",
    "section v discusses the practical implementation of such spl - opos on the basis of the theoretical findings and section vi concludes with some prospective studies aroused by this first theoretical approach .",

    "though the drawing depicts the case of a dual - grating pp material , phase - matched for an ( @xmath29 ) interaction , the model is valid also for any separate birefringent material sections , or a single material phase - matched for both interactions . in the case of birefringent phase - matching however , the opo should be of type - ii kind ( e.g. @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) and the shg of type - i kind ( resp .",

    "periodic oscillations occur , with a period varying in a very complex way when the input pump is increased .",
    "nevertheless no chaotic regime is observed in the range of considered input pump .    in many practical experiments , one can not avoid a weak pump resonance in dros due to the multiwavelength coatings of the mirrors .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate how a moderate pump resonance would affect the ( @xmath281 ) self - locking domain of figs.5 .",
    "the input  external pump intensity is kept equal to @xmath282 to provide a comparison with figs.5 ( @xmath165 @xmath205 ) .",

    "10 , the pump reflectivity is @xmath285 with @xmath261 .",
    "apart from the slight enlargement of the self - locking domains , as compared to fig.5 , which is mainly attributed to the high pumping rate , the intensities are smaller than for the dro , also the intensity distributions are strongly modified , with off - diagonal maxima .    in summary , the only improvement due to a moderate pump resonance is the stabilization effect respective to the onset of temporal dynamics .",
    "the extended self - phase locking range is paid back with lower output intensities .",
    "in order to avoid spurious cavity loss , the use of a dual - grating quasi - phase matched periodically poled crystal is particularly well suited to the implementation of spl - opos .",
    "however , the grating period should be accurately designed so as to phase - matched simultaneously both interactions for the same chip temperature , even though the theoretical analysis predicts a minor influence of shg phase mismatch .    from an experimental point of view , it is desirable to implement 3:1 spl - opos using the least constraining opo configuration . diagnosis methods to check the high phase coherence between the subharmonics under spl have to be implemented . in the frequency domain , this can be achieved by monitoring the beatnote between the signal wave and the externally frequency - doubled idler wave ( or between the summed subharmonics and the pump ) . because under spl operation these two waves are frequency degenerate ,",
    "the output signal wave must be preliminary frequency - shifted by a suitable rf frequency @xmath286 using , e.g. , an acousto - optic modulator .",
    "when the opo operates within the locking range , the beatnote frequency should be fixed to @xmath287 and its power spectral density should approach a dirac function .",
    "another equivalent method to check the phase coherence is to perform an interferometric fringe pattern measurement by overlapping the two beams on a slow detector@xcite . in the following ,",
    "other indirect methods , based on the theoretical analysis will be outlined .    as a starting point of the analysis , we have assumed perfect 3:2:1 frequency ratios for the pump , signal and idler waves . in practical devices",
    ", such a situation will be unlikely met at once .",
    "the major difficulty will come from the fine ( continuous ) tuning of the signal and idler frequencies close enough to the 2:1 degeneracy , in order to fall within the capture range of the self - phase locking . for a fixed pump frequency ,",
    "such a fine tuning is usually performed via the temperature or angle tuning of the phase - matching .",
    "singly resonant devices ( prsros ) offer an easy and relaxed mode - hop free frequency tuning because only one subhamonic wave is resonant , especially in a dual - arm cavity configuration to control independently the pump and signal resonances @xcite .",
    "however from our analysis of the spl - prsro with a resonant signal wave , which also displays subcriticality , extremely small self - locking ranges are predicted due to the weak coupling between the injecting frequency - doubled idler and the resonant signal . while in a conventional prsro the signal field",
    "is constrained to oscillate with a nil cavity detuning , the nonlinear coupling is found to allow oscillation over a small detuning range not exceeding the cavity linewidth .",
    "the increase of the locking range versus the coupling parameter ( e.g. the shg crystal length ) is only moderate , even with @xmath288 ( which would correspond to a shg crystal @xmath289 1.5 times longer than the opo crystal supposing that both opo and shg interactions have the same nonlinearity magnitude ) . due to this limited capture range ,",
    "experimentally confirmed in ref @xcite , 3:1 spl - prsros  would probably require an additional electronic servo on the cavity length to operate as a stable divider device . a convenient criterion for the assessment of spl in prsros would be the slight enhancement of the signal intensity when the nonlinear coupling is switched on , compared to the slight decrease predicted for the spl - dro ( fig.3 ) . a possible way to realize",
    "such a switching is to have an opo - only grating section patterned beside the opo / shg dual - grating section on the periodically - poled wafer .    from our theoretical study , the widest spl range ( a few cavity linewidths )",
    "is obtained with the doubly resonant configuration ( spl - dro ) due to the strong self - injection regime , with eventually a weak pump resonance ( spl - tro ) to stabilize the device .",
    "even though the amount of nonlinear coupling required can be extremely small ( @xmath290 ) - and such low level doubled idler can even be spontaneously generated via non - phase matched or higher - order quasi - phase matching in pp single - grating nonlinear opo crystals - a coupling strength corresponding to @xmath291 will ensure a robust self - phase locking of the subharmonic wave .",
    "preliminary single mode - pair operation of dro / tros usually require an intensity sidelock servo to control the stability of the cavity length .",
    "this sidelock servo compares the output signal ( or idler ) intensity to a stable electronic voltage reference which sets the operating ( usually non - zero ) signal and idler cavity detuning values .",
    "when a linear cavity is used , the signal and idler ( plus eventually the pump ) detunings can not be independently controlled via the cavity length .",
    "it is then probable that the oscillating mode pair will have equal normalized detunings ( condition ( 12a ) ) that satisfy the minimum threshold .  under sidelock servo",
    "the transition from conventional to spl states is accompanied necessarily by a detuning transition ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "it is then important to set the sidelock reference voltage as close as to the maximum fringe intensity in order that the new detuning value does not exceed the allowed subthreshold range . in the case of a well resolved dro mode pair cluster , the observation of these subthreshold states , and the associated broadened mode pair fringe ,",
    "should be made possible via adiabatic cavity length tuning .",
    "such an observation would be an indirect diagnosis of spl .",
    "but it is necessary to have an independent control of the signal and idler detunings to explore the full allowed range of ( @xmath203 ) detunings depicted in figs.5 and 10 .",
    "a dual - cavity dro / tro design would then be appropriate .",
    "the control of these detunings allows the control of the relative phase between the pump , signal and idler . the output subharmonic intensity ratio @xmath292 ( see eq.19 )",
    "can be used as an error signal for the relative phase control .",
    "we have theoretically demonstrated that resonant @xmath293 nonlinear cascaded opo / shg processes induce a self injection - locking between the subharmonic waves of an opo leading to the self - phase locking of the three interacting waves , unlike in a conventional opo for which the absolute phases of the signal and idler are undetermined .",
    "the theoretical treatment encompasses the meanfield model as well as a full propagation model .",
    "the doubly and triply resonant oscillator configurations lead to the widest self phase - locking ranges .",
    "the main conclusions are : a ) the minimum threshold of oscillation of these devices are identical to the conventional devices ; b ) the nonlinear cascading leads to a subcritical behaviour , even in the case of a dro or a pr - sro , and can lead to the occurrence of self - pulsing instabilitities .",
    "this subcriticality is different from the standard subcriticality reported in pump detuned conventional tros .",
    "the nonlinear coupling removes the detuning constraints of conventional systems , allowing for a potentially accurate control of the relative phase between the subharmonic waves .",
    "the range of allowable detunings over which the field phases are locked depends on the magnitude of the nonlinear coupling and on the self - injection regime . while this range is smaller than the cavity linewidth for prsros ( weak injection regime ) , it spans over several cavity linewidths under strong injection - locking regime obtained in signal / idler resonant devices ( dro / tros ) .",
    "the spl - dro / tro give rise to a richer dynamics than the singly resonant prsro for which no occurence of a hopf bifurcation is found in the whole range of the system parameters .",
    "it is thus interesting to extend the theoretical model by including diffraction effects in order to investigate the possible occurrence of new spatio - temporal dynamics , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these self - phase locked opos will be useful tools for applications requiring a high degree of optical phase coherence between optical harmonic waves , such as precision optical measurements in the mid - ir or fourier synthesis of ultra - short optical pulses .",
    "the model developed can be easily extended to the study of divide - by-4 spl - opos based on the cascading opo / opo processes @xmath294 which has the potential to generate up to 8 phase - locked harmonic waves by additional up - conversion processes .",
    "such a strong nonlinearly coupled system can be viewed as a secondary degenerate opo ( dopo ) embedded in a primary dopo .",
    "our future work will be directed to the theoretical investigation of the stability of 4:1 opo dividers .",
    "a classical signature of the system , derived from the meanfield analysis , is the clamping of the secondary pump @xmath23 to the threshold power for the fundamental oscillation .",
    "the present study of 3:1 opo dividers , which makes the simplest assumption of exact 3:2:1 frequency ratios , arouses another interrogation .",
    "an interesting situation not considered regards the behaviour of the nearly 3:1 opo / shg system when the frequency ratios slightly departs from the perfect 3:2:1 division ratio by a radio - frequency quantity @xmath295 , e.g. when @xmath296 .",
    "the frequency difference beween the signal wave and the doubled idler is then @xmath297 .",
    "when the doubled idler frequency does not match one of the cavity eigenmode frequencies , the operation of the opo would be merely that of a conventional dro .",
    "but if the opo is tuned such that @xmath298 @xmath299 being the signal free spectral range of the cavity , then the doubled idler will be enhanced to a point where it may lead to the creation of a new mode pair with frequencies ( @xmath300 ) and so on .",
    "the parametric gain bandwidth of opos extending usually over several thz or several tens of thz ( in case of a wavelength non - critical phase matching ) , a multitude of self - phase locked mode pairs equally spaced by @xmath301 may potentially oscillate , provided that the pumping level is sufficiently high .",
    "such a complex system opens the prospect of building a mode - locked , dual - band opo frequency comb generator using cascaded second - order nonlinearities as the passive mode - locking mechanism .",
    "in the time domain , the output of such a system would consist of a train of short optical pulses with a repetion rate set by the @xmath299 intermode spacing , provided that the relative phase between adjacent mode pairs is preserved and group velocity dispersion is compensated .",
    "we note that a similar cw - dro running near frequency degeneracy with thousands of mode pairs actively locked by an intracavity electro - optic phase modulator has been recently reported , with a striking passive output stability feature compared to a conventional quasi - degenerate single - mode pair dro@xcite .",
