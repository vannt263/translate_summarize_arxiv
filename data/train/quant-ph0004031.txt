    "quantum mechanics attaches physical significance to representations of the rotation group which differ substantially from those studied in classical geometry .",
    "much of the mystery surrounding it is due to this fact .",
    "the enormous interest recently generated by proposals to build a _ quantum computer _",
    "@xcite has focussed attention on the simplest possible quantum system : a two - state system or _",
    "qubit_. our understanding of qubits is based on two distinct geometric models of their states and transformations :    * a complex projective line under the action of @xmath0 . * a euclidean unit @xmath1-sphere under the action of @xmath2 .",
    "the first is used almost exclusively in fundamental quantum physics , while the second ( `` classical '' ) model is used extensively in certain applications , e.g.  nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy @xcite . in particular , in quantum computing",
    "a qubit represents a binary @xmath3 or @xmath4 as its state corresponds to one of a pair of conjugate ( orthogonal ) projective points @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "these in turn correspond to a pair of diametrical points on the unit sphere , which determine the alignment of the qubit with or against the corresponding axis of quantization .",
    "formally , these two models are related by stereographic projection of the riemann ( unit ) sphere onto the argand plane , the points of which are the ratios of the homogeneous coordinates of points on the projective line ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "while this elegant construction describes the mapping between the two representations in a geometric fashion , it does not unite them in a single mathematical structure .",
    "this paper provides an informal account of how this is done by geometric ( aka clifford ) algebra ; in addition , it describes an extension of this formalism to multi - qubit systems , and shows that it provides a concise and lucid means of describing the operations of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "significantly , this extension is most naturally derived via the geometric algebra of minkowski space - time @xcite , which has also been shown to be an efficient formalism within which to study a very wide range of problems in classical , relativistic @xcite and fundamental quantum @xcite physics .",
    "more complete and rigorous accounts may be found in these references , and in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be a three - dimensional euclidean vector space whose inner product is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the clifford or _ geometric algebra _ of @xmath7 is the associative algebra generated by @xmath7 over @xmath9 such that @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "this algebra will be referred to in the following as the _ pauli algebra _ , and denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the interesting thing about this algebra is its geometric interpretation , which will now be described .    to begin , note that every nonzero vector @xmath13 has an inverse @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , a simple application of the law of cosines shows that the inner product of @xmath15 with any other vector @xmath16 is given by the symmetric part of the geometric product : @xmath17 the antisymmetric part , by way of contrast , is called the _ outer product _ , and denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "since the outer product of two vectors @xmath19 is invariant under inversion in the origin , it can not itself be a vector .",
    "the space @xmath20 therefore carries an inequivalent representation of the orthogonal group @xmath21 , and its elements are accordingly called _",
    "bivectors_. these are most naturally interpreted as oriented plane segments , instead of oriented line segments like vectors in @xmath22 .",
    "if we similarly define the outer product of a vector with a bivector and require it to be associative , i.e. @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , then it can be shown via straightforward though somewhat lengthy calculations that this product of three vectors is totally antisymmetric , meaning that the outer product generates the well - known exterior algebra @xmath25 ( cf .  ) .",
    "the outer product of three vectors is called a _ trivector _ , and ( since it changes sign under inversion ) is most appropriately interpreted as an oriented space segment or volume element .",
    "the general properties of inner and outer products in the geometric algebras of arbitrary metric vector spaces can be worked out along these lines in a coordinate - free fashion @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this section will focus on how the pauli algebra is used to describe the quantum mechanics of qubits . in this application",
    "it is more common to work with a fixed orthonormal basis @xmath26 .",
    "quantum mechanics , however , views these basis vectors in a very different way from that taken above , in that they are regarded as _ operators _ on a two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath27 ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". these operators , in turn , are usually identified with the pauli matrices @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an imaginary unit ( @xmath30 ) , the underline signifies that the associated symbol is a matrix , and throughout this paper the symbol `` @xmath31 '' should be read as `` is represented by '' or `` is equivalent to '' .",
    "the connection between the two viewpoints lies the fact that these matrices satisfy the defining relations of the _ abstract _ pauli algebra @xmath12 , namely @xmath32 and hence constitute a faithful matrix representation of it .",
    "this shows , in particular , that @xmath12 is @xmath33-dimensional as a _ real _ linear space .",
    "is often used for @xmath34 . because @xmath15 is geometrically just a vector in @xmath7 ( _ not _ a matrix for it in a basis - dependent representation of @xmath35 )",
    ", this is an abuse of the dot - notation for the euclidean inner product , which is otherwise perhaps the most consistently used notation in all of science .",
    "this abuse of notation will not be perpetrated in this paper . ]    in most physical situations , these operators ( times @xmath36 ) represent measurements of the intrinsic angular momentum of the qubits , and hence are regarded as generators of rotations in the lie algebra @xmath37 over @xmath38 satisfying the commutator relation @xmath39 ~=~ \\imath { { { \\boldsymbol}\\sigma\\!}}_{{\\mathsf{z } } } ~,\\ ] ] and its cyclic permutations . in terms of geometric algebra ,",
    "the left - hand side is just the outer product of the vectors .",
    "the right - hand side is somewhat harder to interpret , because the pauli algebra is defined over the real numbers .",
    "the trick is to observe that , in terms of the matrix representation , @xmath40 .",
    "thus by interpreting the abstract imaginary @xmath29 as the trivector @xmath41 , the angular momentum relations become a triviality : @xmath42 more generally , the vector cross product is related to the outer product by @xmath43 from which it may be seen that multiplication by the unit trivector @xmath44 maps vectors to orthogonal bivectors and vice versa .",
    "since they span a one - dimensional space but change sign under inversion in the origin , trivectors can also be regarded as _ pseudo - scalars_. perhaps the most important thing which geometric algebra contributes to physics are geometric interpretations for the imaginary units which it otherwise uses blindly .    if we denote the induced bivector basis by @xmath45 it is readily seen that these basis bivectors likewise square to @xmath46 .",
    "on multiplying the angular momentum generating relations through by @xmath47 , we obtain @xmath48 this shows that these basis bivectors generate a subalgebra of @xmath12 isomorphic to hamilton s quaternions @xcite , which is also known as the _ even subalgebra _ @xmath49 ( since it is generated by the products of even numbers of vectors ) .",
    "it is well - known that the quaternions multiplicative group is @xmath50 , which implies that the even subalgebra should be closely related to rotations .",
    "this relationship will now be worked out explicitly .",
    "consider the result of conjugating a vector @xmath51 by a vector @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath52 where we have split @xmath53 into its parts parallel and perpendicular to @xmath15 .",
    "this shows that @xmath54 is the _ reflection _ of @xmath51 in the plane orthogonal to @xmath15 . from the well - known fact that the composition of two reflections is a rotation by _",
    "twice _ the lessor angle between their planes and about these planes line of intersection , it follows that conjugating a vector by an element of the even subalgebra just rotates it accordingly : @xmath55 let @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 be the corresponding _ unit _ quaternion .",
    "then @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , the inverse @xmath62 is now simply the _ reverse _ @xmath63 , which in turn corresponds to the _ conjugate _ quaternion @xmath64 .",
    "this reversal operation on @xmath49 extends to a well - defined anti - automorphism of @xmath65 , which corresponds to hermitian conjugation in its representation by pauli matrices . on splitting @xmath51 into its parts parallel @xmath66 and perpendicular @xmath67 to @xmath68 as above",

    "note , however , that this parametrization does not include rotations by @xmath83 .",
    "another two - to - one parametrization of rotations is given by the _ cayley - klein _",

    "spinor_. in particular , the spinors @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 $ ] are those commonly used in quantum computing to store binary information .",
    "since the cayley - klein parameters uniquely determine the @xmath0 matrix , however , we can just as well regard spinors as entities _ in _",
    "@xmath0 , e.g.  @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "the representation of @xmath0 used above depends upon the choice of coordinate system : changing to a different the coordinate system gives a different ( though equivalent ) representation . recalling that @xmath0 is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of unit elements ( quaternions ) in the even subalgebra @xmath49 , a coordinate - free or _ geometric _ interpretation of spinors is obtained by regarding them as elements of @xmath49 itself .",
    "this interpretation of spinors as entities in ordinary euclidean geometry was first pointed out by hestenes over thirty years ago @xcite , but physicists persist in putting operators and operands into separate spaces , and in working with a matrix representation instead of directly with the geometric entities themselves .",
    "the perceived nonintuitive nature of quantum mechanics is due in large part to the resulting confusion over the geometric meaning of the objects with which it deals , which is spelled out explicitly in geometric algebra .    as another example , consider how the _ density operator _ of an `` ensemble '' of qubits can be interpreted in geometric algebra .",
    "this operator @xmath92 is usually defined via a matrix representation as @xmath93 , where the overline denotes the average over the ensemble . as first observed by von neumann",
    ", this matrix contains all the information needed to compute the ensemble average expectation values of the qubit observables , since @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) . to translate this into geometric algebra",
    ", we set the second column of @xmath96 to zero by right - multiplying it by the idempotent matrix @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath98 this corresponds to projecting @xmath99 onto a _",
    "left - ideal _ in @xmath65 , and allows the dyadic product @xmath100 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho1_obs ] ) to be written as : @xmath101 thus the interpretation of the density operator in geometric algebra is @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "the vector part @xmath103 is called the _ polarization vector _ ( in optics , its components are known as the _ stokes parameters _",
    "@xcite , while in nmr it is known as the _ bloch vector _ after the pioneer of nmr who rediscovered it @xcite ) .",
    "its length is @xmath104 with equality if and only if all members of the ensemble are in the same state @xmath105 . in this case",
    "the ensemble is said to be in a _",
    "pure _ state , and the density operator is itself an idempotent @xmath106 , where @xmath107 . for an ensemble in a general _ mixed _ state , the length of the ensemble - average polarization vector measures the degree of alignment among the ( unit length ) polarization vectors of the individual members of the ensemble , and is called the _ polarization _ of the ensemble .    in many physical situations",
    "there is a natural reference direction ; for example , in nmr computing the qubits are spin @xmath108 atomic nuclei whose intrinsic magnetic dipoles have been polarized by the application of a strong magnetic field @xcite . from a geometric perspective , however , the density operator is just the sum of a scalar and a vector , which for a pure state is related to the corresponding `` spinor '' by rotation of a fixed reference vector ( conventionally taken to be @xmath109 as above ) by @xmath105 .",
    "since the trace in the standard matrix representation is simply twice the scalar part @xmath110 of the corresponding expression in geometric algebra , the ensemble - average expectation value @xmath111 is just the component of the polarization vector along the @xmath112-th axis . unlike the _ strong _ measurements usually considered in quantum texts , where measurement of @xmath113 yields one of the random outcomes @xmath114 with probabilities @xmath115 and leaves the system in the corresponding state @xmath116 , _ weak _ measurements of ensemble - average expectation values can be made with only negligible perturbations to the ensemble as a whole @xcite",
    "this is in fact how quantum mechanical systems are usually manifest at the macroscopic level !    to see how all this relates to conventional wisdom , observe that the polarization vector of a pure state may be written in terms of the cayley - klein parameters as @xmath117 its stereographic projection from @xmath118 onto the @xmath119 plane is therefore @xmath120 multiplying by @xmath121 and simplifying the denominator using @xmath122 yields @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a square - root of @xmath46 .",
    "this is the same as the ratio @xmath125 save for the use of @xmath29 instead of @xmath126 as the imaginary unit , which explains formally why @xmath2 acts on the polarization vector in the same way that @xmath0 acts on the ratio of the cayley - klein parameters @xcite .",
    "the above interpretations apply only to single qubits ( or to ensembles consisting of noninteracting and identical qubits ) . extending them to systems of interacting and distinguishable qubits",
    "may be done in a physically significant fashion by considering the geometric algebra of _ space - time _ ( or minkowski space ) @xmath127 .",

    "the important point for our purposes is that the even subalgebra of the dirac algebra @xmath135 is isomorphic to the pauli algebra @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this isomorphism may be constructed by choosing bases @xmath136 and @xmath137 , and defining an invertible linear mapping by @xmath138 these so - called _ relative spatial vectors _ @xmath139 satisfy the relations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pauli_def ] ) , since @xmath140 and hence generate an algebra isomorphic to @xmath12 . as bivectors in @xmath128 , however , they also generate @xmath135 , since @xmath141 ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) , and similarly @xmath144 thus @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) induces an algebra isomorphism as claimed , and when the bases are understood we may identify @xmath147 .",
    "the choice of time - like vector @xmath148 in fact determines an inertial frame up to spatial rotation , in which the _ time _ @xmath149 and _ place _ @xmath150 of an event @xmath151 in that frame are given by @xmath152 ( note that upright case is used for the space - time vector @xmath153 ) .",
    "thus the invariant interval between events separated by the space - time vector @xmath151 is @xmath154 as usual , while the relative velocity between events whose space - time velocities are @xmath155 and @xmath156 is @xmath157 so that @xmath158 lies on an affine hyperplane in space - time .",
    "a great deal of physics can be done in a manifestly lorentz covariant fashion using the dirac algebra .",
    "for example , the electromagnetic field at a given point in space - time corresponds to an arbitrary bivector @xmath159 , called the _",
    "faraday bivector _ , and the covariant form of the lorentz force equation is @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the rest mass , @xmath162 the charge and @xmath163 the space - time velocity .",
    "( this is another example of the general rule that , in geometric algebra , the generators of motion are bivectors @xcite . ) the usual frame - dependent form is recovered by splitting the quantities in this equation by @xmath155 as above @xcite ; in particular , the faraday bivector splits into an electric and a magnetic field as @xmath164 , where @xmath165 the space - time reverse will be denoted by a tilde , e.g.  in the present case @xmath166 .",
    "this is related to the spatial ( or pauli ) reverse by @xmath167 .",
    "both operations agree on the pauli - even subalgebra , but the spatial reverse _ not _ lorentz coveriant since it depends on a particular @xmath168 .",
    "returning to our previous discussion of the density operator , we observe that the space - time form of the density operator of a single qubit polarized along @xmath169 can be written as @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the polarization and @xmath155 determines the local inertial frame .",
    "it follows that the lorentz covariant form of the density operator is a time - like vector @xmath172 . under a lorentz boost @xmath173 along @xmath174 , therefore , the relativistic density operator @xmath175 transforms to @xmath176 @xmath177 this implies that in the unaccelerated frame ( with renormalization by @xmath178 ) , @xmath179 it follows that the polarization itself transforms as @xmath180 if we assume the qubit is at equilibrium with a heat bath , statistical mechanics tells us that @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the inverse temperature and @xmath183 is the energy difference between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states @xcite .",
    "then the addition formulae for @xmath184 and @xmath185 give @xmath186 so the apparent equilibrium polarization depends on velocity .",
    "these results are not to be found in the classic treatise on relativistic thermodynamics @xcite",
    ".    we will now construct a lorentz covariant _ multiparticle theory _ of qubit systems in the simplest possible way , by taking a direct sum of copies of space - time ( regarded as a vector space , rather than an algebra ) , one for each of the @xmath187 qubits , i.e. @xmath188 and considering the associated geometric algebra @xmath189 .",
    "then the even subalgebras of different particle spaces @xmath190 _ commute _ , since ( in any given bases ) @xmath191 for all @xmath142 , so that the algebra generated by the even subalgebras is isomorphic to a tensor product of these algebras , written as @xmath192 this construction of the tensor product was first used by clifford as a means of studying the tensor products of quaternion algebras @xcite ; van der waerden has in fact called it a clifford algebra of the second kind @xcite . as a means of justifying the tensor product of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in terms of the underlying geometry of space - time , however , it is a much more recent development @xcite .",
    "a key feature of quantum mechanics , which is needed for quantum computers to be able to solve problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts , is an exponential growth in the dimension of the hilbert space of a multi - qubit system with the number of particles involved .",
