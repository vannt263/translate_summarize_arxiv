    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory collected more than 2000 gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in its 9-year activity .",
    "the analysis of such a large sample has deeply characterized the temporal and spectral properties of grbs ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) . despite the multitude and complexity of the light curves observed , the burst duration , typically defined by @xmath6 as the time interval during which 90% of the fluence is accumulated ( kouvelitou et al . 1993 ) , indicates the existence of two main classes : short ( @xmath7 s ) and long ( @xmath7 s ) bursts .",
    "this distinction is also reinforced by the associated spectral shape since short bursts are typically harder than long ones ( fishman & meegan 1995 ; mitrofanov et al .",
    "1998 ) . at present , it is not known if this dichotomy is produced by different progenitors or by different physical mechanisms originating from the same object or , again , from different observing conditions . nonetheless , it has been suggested ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) that long bursts might be produced by the core collapse of a single massive stars ( the collapsar model ",
    "woosley 1993 ; paczynski 1998 ) whereas short bursts might be more efficiently generated by double compact object mergers ( goodman 1997 ; narayan , piran & kumar 2001 ) or double neutron star heating ( salmonson & wilson 2002 ) .",
    "a distinctive feature of these two scenarios is the expected grb distance : compact object mergers should have a lower median redshift than collapsars ( fryer , woosley & hartmann 1999 ) which would be tracers of the high redshift universe ( lamb 2001 ) .    a cosmological origin of long bursts was first suggested by the isotropic sky distribution observed by batse ( briggs 1993 ; meegan et al .",
    "1992 ; paczynski 1995 ) but the definitive proof came with the first redshift measurement for grb 970508 ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) at @xmath8 . at present",
    ", the distribution of known redshifts extends up to z=4.5 with a mean @xmath9 ( andersen et al . 2000 ; djorgovski et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however very little is presently known about short grbs because no radio , optical or x - ray counterpart has been associated with any burst lasting less than 2 s ( hurley et al .",
    "2002 ) , although the possible existence of short burst afterglows has been suggested ( lazzati , ramirez - ruiz & ghisellini 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the distance scale of short grbs is still an open issue and its solution would have important implications for the understanding of their progenitors .",
    "the aim of this letter is to investigate the nature of short grbs by means of statistical techniques such as the angular two - point correlation function , since different hypotheses are expected to leave different imprints on their distribution on the sky .",
    "in particular we will concentrate on the two distinct possibilities of burst repetition and large - scale structure",
    ". + in order to do so , we have considered sources from the public batse on line catalogue which contains 2702 bursts from grb 910421 to grb 000526 . for our analysis ,",
    "a key ingredient is the estimate of the duration @xmath6 , which has been derived only for 2041 events of this catalogue . also , the flux and fluence are only available for 2135 events .",
    "the maximum number of bursts that we could extract with measured durations and fluences is 2035 , of which 497 are short events with @xmath7 s.    our work is presented as follows : in section 2 we briefly recall the results of previous works examining evidence for grb anisotropies , while in section 3 we introduce the method and show the results on the angular correlation function .",
    "section 4 discusses some possible models for the observed distribution of short grbs and summarizes our conclusions .",
    "first studies on the angular distribution of grbs by hartmann & blumenthal ( 1989 ) including 80 grbs detected by the ipn and 160 grbs collected by konus , showed a possible deviation from isotropy on scales @xmath10 . a more refined analysis ( quashnock & lamb 1993 ) based on the first batse ( 1b ) catalogue ( 260 bursts ) confirmed this evidence but with a cut on the burst positional errors @xmath11 ( but see cautions in narayan & piran 1993 ; brainerd 1996 ) .    the analysis of joint spatial and temporal clustering of the bursts in the 1b catalog ( wang & lingenfelter 1995 ) showed an excess of bursts with angular separation lower than @xmath12 within 4 days with a small probability ( @xmath13 ) of random occurrence .",
    "however , less significant results are claimed by petrosian & efron ( 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , the need of larger samples for investigation of the possible burst repetition by means of the two  point correlation function is discussed by brainerd ( 1996 ) .",
    "evidence of possible burst clustering was recently claimed for both the populations of short and intermediate grbs from the analysis of larger samples ( balazs et al .",
    "1998 ; meszaros et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the possible different nature of the short and long events , in fact suggests the separate analysis and comparison of their clustering properties .",
    "one of the possible statistical tests for the detection of anisotropy is provided by the two - point angular correlation function @xmath0 , which gives the excess probability , with respect to a random poisson distribution , of finding two sources in the solid angles @xmath14 @xmath15 separated by an angle @xmath16 we applied this technique to the distinct samples of long and short grbs in order to investigate for possible deviations from isotropy in their spatial distribution .    given the large uncertainties affecting the determination of the positions of grbs , especially in the case of short - lived ones ( see figure 1 ) , we have decided to only consider those objects which have angular coordinates with associated errors @xmath17 . the choice for this value results as the best compromise between the requirements of precision - position measurements and large - enough datasets to allow for sensible statistical analysis .",
    "by applying the above cut , we end up respectively with @xmath18 ( out of 1538 ) and @xmath19 ( out of 497 ) sources in the case of long - lived and short - lived grbs .",
    "random catalogues have subsequently been generated for each of the two subsets , with positions of the objects uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere . in order to minimize poisson fluctuations due to the limited number of sources in the original datasets , random catalogues were required to include @xmath20 objects in the case of long - lived grbs and @xmath21 objects in the case of short - lived grbs .",
    "we then counted the number of distinct data - data pairs ( @xmath22 ) , data - random pairs ( @xmath23 , and distinct random - random pairs ( @xmath24 ) as a function of angular separation , and calculated the two - point angular correlation function @xmath0 using the estimator ( hamilton 1993 ) @xmath25 on the angular scales @xmath26 degrees .    the open dots in figs .",
    "2 and 3 illustrate the results respectively for the population of long - lived and short - lived grbs ; the error bars indicate poisson estimates for the points .",
    "we note that , while in the first case values of @xmath0 at all angular scales seem to be consistent with an isotropic distribution , the angular correlation function of short - lived grbs shows a significant excess of power on scales @xmath27 degrees .    in order to test the significance of this result ,",
    "we have furtherly examined two reduced datasets , obtained from the original one by only considering those sources with positions known to better than @xmath28 ( 1239 long and 196 short grbs ) .",
    "solid squares in both figs .",
    "2 and 3 illustrate the values of @xmath0 obtained in this case .",
    "once again , measurements of the angular correlation function for long - lived grbs are entirely consistent with absence of intrinsic non - randomness , in agreement with earlier results ( e.g. meegan et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; bennett & rhie 1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1996 ) obtained for samples which mainly included this population of gamma - ray emitters , and with more recent findings ( e.g. balazs et al . 1998 ; meszaros et al . 2000 ) concerning the population of long - lived grbs alone .",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of short - lived , @xmath29 grbs  even though with larger errors due to the small number of objects considered in the analysis  shows a departure from isotropy on small angular scales even stronger than it was for the previously - analysed @xmath30 subsample .",
    "we can then conclude that the distribution of short - lived gamma - ray bursts exhibits a @xmath12@xmath2 deviation from isotropy on scales @xmath31 degrees .",
    "given the above result on the anisotropic distribution of short - lived grbs , it is worthwhile investigating ( and possibly excluding ) all the systematics which could produce a non - zero signal in the angular correlation function .",
    "+ one of the possible causes for systematic deviations from isotropy is related to the non - uniform sky - exposure of batse ( fishman et al .",
    "1994 ; band 1996 ) , which in principle could lead to measurements of anisotropy even for randomly distributed sources .",
    "we note however that such an effect would affect the observed distribution of both long and short grbs in a similar fashion , since there is no _ a priori _ reason why different sub - classes should be observed by the instrument in different ways .",
    "the fact that long - lived sources exhibit a @xmath0 which is highly consistent with the hypothesis of isotropy at all the angular scales probed by our analysis then tends to exclude responsibility from instrumental effects on the observed anisotropy of short - lived grbs ( see also balazs et al . 1998 ; meszaros et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "another possible cause for the observed anisotropic distribution can be attributed to intrinsic poissonian fluctuations of short - lived grbs due to their small number .",
    "such an effect would however produce random fluctuations of the measured correlation function at all angular scales , while the data in our case show that an appreciable deviation from zero values is only obtained on small distances ; measurements of @xmath0 at all @xmath32 are remarkably consistent with a null clustering signal . as a further test , we have re - binned sources belonging to the sub - class of short - lived grbs and evaluated the two - point correlation function by means of equation ( [ eqn : wtheta_ests ] ) in the angular range @xmath33 degrees .",
    "+ results from this analysis are presented in figure 4 : once again a marked deviation from isotropy is only detected on scales @xmath34 degrees , in full agreement with the findings of the previous section .",
    "having excluded the effects of systematics on the detected anisotropy , we are then left with intrinsic non - randomness in the distribution of short - lived grbs . this intrinsic anisotropic distribution would arise if e.g. some of the sources were repeating bursts , as indeed expected in several grb models ( quashnock & lamb 1993 ; wang & lingenfelter 1995 ; meegan et al .",
    "1995 ; bennett & rie 1996 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "if we define @xmath35 as the fraction of observed bursts that can be labeled as repeaters and @xmath36 as the average number of observed events per repeating source ( @xmath37 ) then , for positional errors drawn from a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , see figure 1 ) , the correlation signal arising from the repeating - burst assumption can be written as ( see meegan et al .",
    "1995 ) @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq : w ] ) was used to fit the data presented in figure 4 for different values of the product @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that the best - fit value is given by @xmath42 , result which rejects the hypothesis of non - repetitivity at the @xmath43 confidence level .",
    "+ by then fixing the average number of repeating events , we obtain the following constraints on the fraction of sources expected to repeat : @xmath44 in other words , the data indicate that up to 13 per cent of short grbs may have burst on average twice during the years corresponding to the lifetime of batse .",
    "this fraction obviously decreases for an increasing number of repetitions , going down to a more negligible @xmath45 per cent in the case of @xmath46 .",
    "the above explanation is however not the only one capable to account for the observed anisotropy on a few degrees scale .",
    "another alternative which needs to be taken into account is the presence of large - scale structure , arising under the hypothesis that short grbs trace the distribution of the galaxies in which they reside ( note that here we are explicitly assuming grbs to be extragalactic sources ) . in this framework ,",
    "the angular correlation function can be modeled ( to a first approximation ) as the power - law @xmath47 ( see e.g. peebles 1980 )",
    ".    fits to the data presented in figure 4 give values for the amplitude of the correlation function @xmath48 , independent ( within the errors ) of the different values for the slope @xmath49 , chosen so to mimic the clustering properties respectively of star - forming and early - type galaxies , and of a mixture of both . the case for @xmath50",
    "is illustrated in figure 4 by the dotted line . despite the large errors associated to its determination , the allowed range of values for @xmath51 is in good agreement with results e.g. from the apm survey ( loveday et al .",
    "1995 ) based on samples of @xmath52 galaxies divided by morphological type . on the other hand , clustering analyses performed at higher redshifts find amplitudes which are much smaller than the values indicated by the grb data ( @xmath53 for @xmath54 eros , roche et al . 2002 ; @xmath55 for @xmath56 lyman break galaxies , porciani & giavalisco 2002 ; @xmath57 for @xmath58 galaxies found in the hubble deep field , magliocchetti & maddox 1999 ) . if we then use large - scale structure to explain the clustering measurements presented in this work",
    ", we can conclude that  if confirmed  they imply short - lived grbs to be hosted by relatively ( possibly @xmath59 ) local galaxies , in agreement with the median redshift 0.50.8 predicted by neutron star / neutron star or black hole / neutron star merger models ( fryer et al .",
    "in fact ( see e.g. macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , the alternative to produce short bursts in the context of the collapsar model would meet some difficulties at @xmath60 since the intense mass loss from the progenitor - due to a higher metallicity with respect to that of stars at higher redshifts - could prevent the collapse of the helium core .",
    "obviously , one would like to discern between an anisotropic signal caused by burst repetition and one due to large - scale structure .",
    "unfortunately , the still small number of detected sources does not allow to probe angular scales @xmath61 degrees where these two effects would greatly differentiate from one another .",
    "the solution to this problem is however within reach , since the goal of collecting hundreds of grbs per year will be soon achieved by swift ( burrows et al .",
    "2002 ) , which will also allow for precise position measurements in order to perform optical to x - ray spectrophotometry , with the aim to determine the origin of grbs and their afterglows and to use bursts to investigate the early universe . moreover , the likely detection of several short bursts ( which was severely limited in the batse experiment due to its lower sensitivity to extremely fast transients ) by integral and their location with sufficient accuracy through the ipn system will lead to a better understanding of the still mysterious population of short bursts .",
