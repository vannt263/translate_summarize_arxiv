    "<S> a new constraint is obtained on the cp - violating flavor mixing between the left - handed top scalar quark @xmath0 and charm scalar quark @xmath1 , by considering a chargino loop contribution to chromo - electric dipole moment of strange quark , which is limited by the electric dipole moment of the @xmath2hg atom . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the flavor mixing should be suppressed to the level of @xmath3 for the cp phase of order unity , when @xmath4 is relatively large and sparticle masses lie in a few hundred gev range . </S>",
    "<S> although it is much stronger than the known constraint from the chargino loop contribution to @xmath5 , the moderate constraint we obtain here is argued to leave room for sizable supersymmetric contribution to the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> although low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is thought to be one of the most promising solutions to the naturalness problem on the electroweak scale inherent in the standard model @xcite , a random choice of supersymmetry breaking parameters would lead to phenomenological disaster . </S>",
    "<S> contributions from superparticle loops would induce too large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetric contributions to electric dipole moments ( edms ) would also exceed experimental upper bounds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these two problems are referred to as the susy flavor problem and the susy cp problem , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry breaking and its mediation to the standard model sector must therefore be well controlled to avoid the aforementioned disaster . </S>",
    "<S> one way to escape from the susy flavor problem is to invoke hypothetical degeneracy of masses of squarks and sleptons among different generations . </S>",
    "<S> this approach includes minimal supergravity @xcite , gauge mediation @xcite , anomaly mediation @xcite and gaugino mediation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another way is an alignment mechanism @xcite of generation mixing of sfermion mass terms with their fermion counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> this requires understanding not only sfermion mass generation but also fermion mass generation mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> though appealing , it is rather non - trivial to construct convincing models of flavor . to see what kind of mediation mechanism really works , it is important to explore possible constraints coming from experimental data . as for the constraints on the mixing of the first two generations , </S>",
    "<S> this issue has been studied extensively in the literature ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the constraints involving the third generation are still under study and this is the subject of the present paper .    a remarkable observation has recently been made by hisano and shimizu , who have pointed out that supersymmetric contribution to the chromo - electric dipole moment ( cedm ) of the strange quark is strongly constrained by the edm of the @xmath2hg atom @xcite . in particular they have found that a product of left- and right - handed squark mixings suffers from a stringent constraint . </S>",
    "<S> this is very interesting because the flavor conserving process ( edm ) constrains the flavor mixing of squarks . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the tight constraint on the squark flavor mixings puts an important impact on susy contribution to the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the bound implies that the contribution from @xmath7 mixing should be extremely small , giving a severe restriction on an interesting scenario where large contribution comes from renormalization group effects of right - handed neutrino yukawa interaction in grand unified susy models @xcite .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we shall point out that the bound on the edm of the @xmath2hg atom gives a new constraint on the up - type left - handed squark mixing when one considers chargino - loop processes . </S>",
    "<S> we will compare this constraint with that from @xmath8 and also argue implications to the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first clarify some notations on the squark masses and mixing used in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to define @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an @xmath11 element of the left - handed ( right - handed ) squark mass squared matrix for up - type squarks in the superckm basis , in which the yukawa coupling matrices are in the diagonal form , and @xmath12 is an average squark mass . a similar notation will be used for the down - type squarks .    </S>",
    "<S> next we would like to briefly review the cedm for quarks and its contribution to the edm of the @xmath2hg atom . </S>",
    "<S> we follow ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian for the cedm for quarks is written @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath15 represents the gluon field strength with @xmath16 generator index @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the cedm of the quark @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the edm of the @xmath2hg atom is dominated by the t - odd nuclear force in @xmath20 and @xmath21 couplings to nucleons , which is generated by the cedms of the constituent quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the edm of the mercury atom was evaluated as @xmath22 which is constrained by the existing experimental data , @xmath23 at 95% c.l . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . despite the small numerical coefficient in front of @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> , the strange quark contribution can be important since @xmath24 itself is enhanced by a heavier quark mass in the second ( and sometimes third ) generation . </S>",
    "<S> when the contributions from the up and down quarks are absent , the constraint on the edm of the atom gives the bound to the cedm of the strange quark as @xmath25 the chromo - dipole moment may also be constrained by the neutron edm . </S>",
    "<S> however the computation of the latter is more model - dependenthg atom . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued , however , that it is likely to be an overestimate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more conservative estimation shows the neutron edm provides a similar limit with the @xmath2hg edm , though it is model - dependent . ] </S>",
    "<S> and thus we do not consider the constraint coming from the neutron edm .    </S>",
    "<S> since edms are flavor conserving processes , contributions from the ( flavor conserving ) cp phases of @xmath17 and @xmath26 parameters have been extensively discussed in the framework of susy models . by imposing the experimental bounds of the edms of the electron , neutron and mercury atom on edm operators generated by flavor diagonal interactions , we obtain @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite . here we do not discuss possible mechanisms to suppress </S>",
    "<S> the cp phases of the @xmath17 and @xmath26 parameters , and simply assume that they satisfy the bounds given above .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , hisano and shimizu have found that the bound eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bound - on - cedm - of - s ] ) gives a very stringent constraint on squark flavor mixing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically they have pointed out that the cp violating part of the product of @xmath29 and @xmath30 is strongly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that in the presence of sizable @xmath31 and @xmath32 mixing the dominant contribution to the cedm of the strange quark arises from the gluino - loop diagram with the @xmath33 mixing , which is proportional to @xmath34 , and thus is enhanced by @xmath35 over the usual contribution induced by the @xmath36 mixing .    </S>",
    "<S> although their constraint is only for the product of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , it practically restricts the phase of @xmath30 in most models with high energy susy breaking . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath29 is expected to emerge inevitably at low energy scales due to renormalization group effects even if it is absent at the cutoff scale , say , the planck scale . at the electroweak scale it is evaluated as @xmath37 at least unless there is accidental cancellation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the bound of the @xmath2hg edm constrains the @xmath38 mixing in the right - right ( rr ) sector as @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this has an important implication to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the wilson coefficient from the gluino penguin diagrams which contribute to the @xmath40 strongly correlates with that for the @xmath2hg edm . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 which originates from the @xmath32 mixing should be generically suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this argument leaves @xmath31 mixing as a possible source of large cp asymmetry in @xmath41 transition . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is important to investigate to what extent large @xmath31 mixing is allowed .    </S>",
    "<S> we now point out that the ll mixing is also constrained by the @xmath2hg edm bound . </S>",
    "<S> we first emphasize that chargino - mediated processes can also provide large contributions to the cedm of the strange quark @xmath24 because there are diagrams which are enhanced by the top yukawa coupling constant ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] ) . in the presence of @xmath38 mixing in the ll sector , @xmath42 is induced by the double mass insertion diagram in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram](a ) and is evaluated as ) from the weak scale to the hadronic scale is small @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the enhancement factor is calculated as @xmath43 , and thus we neglect it in our analysis . ] </S>",

    "<S> the loop function @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the function @xmath45 is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mab ] . </S>",
    "<S> here the mass insertion parameter @xmath51 is given as @xmath52 and the term proportional to @xmath53 can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 parameterizes the cp violating phase as @xmath55 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath24 from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram](a ) is estimated as @xmath56 compared with the experimental upper limit eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bound - on - cedm - of - s ] ) , we obtain @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we conclude that the @xmath61 mixing angle or the cp violating phase must be suppressed at the level of @xmath62 when @xmath4 is large , in the light of the result of the @xmath2hg edm experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that @xmath63 mixing is induced by a combination of @xmath64 and @xmath61 mixing through the double mass insertion diagram : @xmath65 based on this observation , it is manifest that @xmath66 is also constrained considering the diagram in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 from this contribution is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mab ] ) and @xmath69 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> following the same procedures , the @xmath63 mixing parameter is found to be constrained as @xmath70 for the same susy parameters as in the @xmath61 case .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the constraint on the mixing parameter @xmath71 given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : constraint_on_ll ] ) is severer than that obtained from the branching fraction of the process @xmath5 . so far the limit on @xmath5 was considered to give the strongest bound on @xmath71 taking chargino - loop diagrams into consideration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however we find that the @xmath2hg edm generically provides severer constraint on @xmath71 by about one or two orders of magnitude depending on mass spectra of superparticles , provided that the cp phase is of order unity . </S>",
    "<S> the same argument is also applied to @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have dealt with the diagrams shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagram ] exclusively . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider other possible diagrams producing the cedm of the strange quark . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the constraint on the mixing @xmath73 is turned out to be weakened by the cabibbo angle and that on the rr mixing @xmath74 by about @xmath75 compared with that on @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we find that the ll mixing @xmath76 most considerably enhances the chargino - origin dipole moment of the strange quark among off - diagonal elements of the scaler quarks and thus should be bounded most stringently .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath77 and @xmath78 are related to each other because of the @xmath79 symmetry . in the superckm basis </S>",
    "<S> , one finds that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath82 component can be expanded as @xmath83 in terms of the wolfenstein parameter @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the absence of accidental cancellation or hierarchy among the parameters the bound on @xmath85 is translated into that on @xmath76 , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the severest bound on @xmath85 comes from gluino - mediated @xmath5 via a double mass insertion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the constraint on the @xmath38 mixing in the ll sector from the @xmath2hg edm is generically as strict as that in this @xmath5 process , though detailed comparison is sensitive to the susy mass spectra .. on the other hand , the constraint on the mixing of the up - type squarks eq.([eq : constraint_on_ll ] ) obtained in a previous paragraph is very general . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss the @xmath6 process , which is known to be one of the most interesting modes . </S>",
    "<S> the belle collaboration @xcite has reported the deviation of the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 from the sm prediction , while the latest result from the babar collaboration @xcite is consistent with the sm prediction . from the theoretical side , cp violation additional to the sm </S>",
    "<S> is expected to manifest itself in this process because the tree - level sm contribution is absent . </S>",
    "<S> although it is shown that both @xmath31 and @xmath32 mixing should be suppressed because of the @xmath5 and the @xmath2hg edm constraints , there still remains some room to cause a sizable effect on the indirect cp - violation parameter @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the bound on the @xmath31 mixing parameter is not as tight as that on @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the prediction of @xmath86 can be considerably affected since @xmath31 mixing combines with @xmath87 mixing to induce significant @xmath88 mixing for large @xmath4 @xcite . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the mass difference between @xmath89 and @xmath90 would not deviate considerably from its sm prediction under the circumstance and is expected to be measured at tevatron run ii @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the contribution from the induced @xmath88 mixing is enhanced in the dipole operators and thus considerably affects @xmath5 and @xmath91 processes , box diagrams which involve the induced @xmath88 mixing are sub - dominant in @xmath92 mixing .    here </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss loopholes that escape the new bound given above , namely possibilities of cancellation or suppression of the contributions to the @xmath2hg edm : ( i ) as masses of superparticles increase , the contribution to the dipole moment becomes suppressed ; ( ii ) there might be the case where various contributions to the @xmath2hg edm cancel out each other . the gluino - loop contribution may cancel out the chargino contribution discussed above . also , </S>",
    "<S> though we have considered the contribution only from the strange quark , it may be possible that the contributions from the up and down quarks compensate it and that the resulting mercury edm becomes negligible ; ( iii ) the phase of @xmath93 may align with that of @xmath71 by some mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the imaginary part of @xmath93 is less constrained by edm experiments ; ( iv ) there remains theoretical uncertainty in evaluating the edm of @xmath2hg atom , which relies on calculations on nuclear and hadron dynamics .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to emphasize the importance of constraining the cp - violating @xmath38 mixing in the ll sector . given the minimal supergravity boundary condition , @xmath85 emerges from renormalization group running and becomes proportional to @xmath94 , and thus its imaginary part is naturally suppressed since there arises no new cp - violating phase except for the ckm matrix . </S>",
    "<S> however in the case where the solution of the susy flavor problem is attributed to some alignment mechanism based on flavor symmetries generation mixing is expected to be accompanied by large cp - violating phases independent of the ckm matrix . </S>",
    "<S> therefore our new constraint on cp - violating mixing may offer a crucial hint in building models of flavor , which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite . </S>"
