    "in a previous paper ( carney et al .  2003 hereafter c2003 ) , we discussed results from over two thousand high - resolution ( r = 32,000 ) , low signal - to - noise ( 10 to 50 per resolution element ) spectra of 91 field metal - poor red giant branch ( rgb ) and red horizontal branch ( rhb ) stars .",
    "radial velocities were obtained by cross - correlating each observed spectrum with a synthetic spectrum that closely matched the adopted temperature , gravity , and metallicity for the star .",
    "sixteen stars were found to be single - lined spectroscopic binaries , and orbital solutions were presented for 14 of them . excluding those 14 stars , observations of the stars covered spans from 2956 days to 6670 days , roughly from 8 to 18 years , with an average of 13.7 years .",
    "the use of synthetic spectra enabled us to measure line broadening as well as radial velocities .",
    "we found some anticipated results as well as some surprises .",
    "for example , studies of rgb stars in globular clusters ( gunn & griffin 1979 ; mayor & mermilliod 1984 ; lupton et al .",
    "1987 ; pryor et al .",
    "1988 ; ct et al .  1996 , 2002 ; brown & wallerstein 1992 ; kraft et al .  1997 ; mayor et al .  1997 ) have shown that the most luminous stars , generally with @xmath4 , show velocity variability that is unlikely to be associated with orbital motion .",
    "about half of the stars studied by c2003 with estimated @xmath1 values more luminous than @xmath5 also showed such velocity variability , which is often referred to as  jitter \" . the term s ambiguity describes the absence of a well - understood cause of the velocity variability .",
    "as expected , the spectroscopic binary frequency , for periods less than 6000 days , was very similar to that found for metal - poor dwarfs and subgiants ( latham et al .  2002 ; goldberg et al .",
    "there was some evidence for a dearth of short - period binaries among the rgb and rhb stars , which is not too surprising .",
    "most short period systems are expected to undergo mass transfer when the more massive star begins to expand and fills its roche lobe .",
    "the period does shorten initially , until the donor star s mass becomes less than that of the original secondary star , following which the orbital separation widens and the period increases . among the fourteen spectroscopic binaries in c2003 with orbital solutions , two systems with small ratios of orbital semi - major axis to estimated primary stellar radius",
    "have circular orbits , presumably the result of tidal interactions .",
    "these two stars also had higher line broadenings than other rgb stars , presumably due to higher rotational velocities , a consequence of tidally - induced locking of the rotational and orbital periods rather than @xmath6  sin  @xmath7 . ] .",
    "the most unexpected result involved the dependence of the measured line broadening on the stars evolutionary state . for most of the rgb stars ,",
    "the line broadening was generally smaller than our instrumental resolution ( about 8.5 ) .",
    "but at the highest luminosities , the mean line broadening rose to values as high as about 12  at @xmath8 , and perhaps as high as 15  if our interpretation of the apparent periodicity in the velocity jitter of two stars was interpreted correctly as due to the rotational period .",
    "these very high levels of line broadening seemed to rule out macroturbulence .",
    "we also discounted transfer of core rotational angular momentum to the surface of the rgb stars because we should have seen significant increases in line broadening where internal mixing manifests itself by changes in atmospheric abundances .",
    "having ruled out alternative explanations , we speculated that a  spin up \" in outer envelope rotational velocities could have been caused by the absorption of giant planets .",
    "this would imply that metal - poor stars might have such planets _ and _ that they exist at larger orbital distances from the host stars than have been found to date in many metal - rich disk stars .",
    "we also observed significant line broadening in the rhb stars .",
    "to first order , this makes sense . if the much larger stars near the tip of the rgb stars rotate , then so should their descendents . but perhaps their descendents should be stars whose enhanced rotation helps them shed their outer envelopes , which should lead to core helium - burning stars blueward of the instability strip , known as blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars .",
    "soker ( 1998 ) and siess & livio ( 1999 ) argued that absorption of a planet by a luminous red giant could explain the high rotation velocities often found among field bhb stars ( kinman et al .",
    "2000 ; behr 2003 ) and cluster bhb stars ( peterson et al .  1983",
    "; peterson 1985a ; peterson et al .",
    "1995 ; cohen & mccarthy 1997 ; behr et al .",
    "2000a , b ; recio - blanco et al .  2002 ) .",
    "more generally , theorists have struggled to explain the presence of both rhb and bhb stars in clusters whose stars share the same metallicity .",
    "some  second parameter \" must be at work , presumably leading to either larger ( rhb ) envelope masses or smaller ones ( bhb stars ) . if rotation is the second parameter , then why do rhb stars in the field appear to have rotational velocities comparable to bhb stars , when allowance is made for their different radii ?",
    "c2003 suggested four follow - up studies .",
    "first , expand the sample to ascertain if our original sample was unusual in some manner .",
    "this paper reports on the results of a  hasty \" study of 45 additional metal - poor field stars .",
    "we also sought to obtain line broadening measures for giants in globular clusters , and initial data for four clusters are in hand .",
    "results will be published later .",
    "if planets do exist around metal - poor stars , this would suggest that disk instability is a viable mechanism for planet formation , and a high - precision radial velocity survey of roughly two hundred metal - poor field stars was begun ( see sozzetti et al .",
    "finally , we have to ask if the line broadening is due to rotation or to macroturbulence .",
    "this can be determined with very high - resolution , high - s / n spectra that enable fourier transform studies of line profiles , following gray ( 1982 ; 1984 ) and gray & toner ( 1986 ; 1987 ) .",
    "we have completed acquisition and analysis of such spectra and will report on the results in a future paper ( carney et al .",
    "c2003 discussed in detail the criteria by which they assembled their list of rgb and rhb field stars for study .",
    "these followed mostly the earlier study of carney & latham ( 1986 ) , which in turn relied on the kinematically - unbiased metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath9  @xmath10 ) samples identified by bond ( 1980 ) .",
    "he identifield weak - lined stars using objective prism spectroscopy as well as follow - up @xmath11 photometry .",
    "norris , bessell , & pickles ( 1985 ) undertook a large program of additional ddo and @xmath12 photometry .",
    "most of the stars in the c2003 sample had been classified as metal - poor red giants by anthony - twarog & twarog ( 1994 ; hereafter att ) , who supplied estimated reddening and @xmath1 values .",
    "all but one of the 45 stars discussed in this paper come from att , and most of them were identified originally by bond ( 1980 ) .",
    "the stars in this study represent most of the stars in att with [ fe / h ] @xmath13 not studied by c2003 but within reach of the telescopes employed in that program . to make certain that the stars are all luminous ,",
    "we have employed the hipparcos database , which includes 44 of the stars ( only bd+25  3410 lacks a measured trigonometric parallax ) .",
    "the parallaxes are all very small and consistent with high luminosities .",
    "the spectra of our new program stars have been obtained in the same fashion as those studied by c2003 , using the center for astrophysics digital speedometers ( latham 1985 , 1992 ) , primarily with the 1.5-m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory in harvard , massachusetts , as well as the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector and the mmt instruments atop mt .",
    "hopkins in arizona .",
    "the tillinghast reflector was especially important for the stars south of @xmath14  and north of @xmath15  in declination .",
    "also as before , the wavelength coverage is 45   , centered near 5187  , with a resolution of 8.5  .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio varied from 10 to 50 per resolution element , with a typical value of about 15 .",
    "c2003 described in detail the measurement of the radial velocities .",
    "a grid of model atmospheres , defined by @xmath16 , log  @xmath17 , and [ fe / h ] values , was computed .",
    "the grid spacing in temperature was 250  k , 0.5 dex in log  @xmath17 , and 0.5 dex in metallicity for [ fe / h ] @xmath18 .",
    "functions and elemental abundances in which all the  @xmath19 \" elements ( o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , and ti ) were enhanced by 0.4 dex relative to the solar abundances .",
    "more details may be found in nrdstrom et al.(1994 ) and c2003 .",
    "the program synthe was used to compute synthetic spectra in the wavelength range 5146 - 5229  . in the case of the sun",
    ", we obtained an excellent line - by - line match between the kurucz solar model and _ synthetic _ spectrum compared with the _ observed _ solar flux spectrum ( kurucz et al .",
    "synthe computes specific intensity at 17 different emergent angles across the stellar disk , and integration over the disk , including the effects of stellar rotation , yields the synthetic flux spectrum .",
    "synthe enables us to include the effects of instrumental resolution , which we chose to be a gaussian with a fwhm of 8.5  , which is appropriate to the instrumentation we employed .",
    "the adopted microturbulent velocities were 2  , and macroturbulent velocities were 3 . at each combination of temperature , gravity , and metallicity in our grid we computed synthetic spectra employing a wide range of rotational broadening profiles , with @xmath6  =   0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 , 120 , and 140  .    once the stellar parameters , @xmath16 , log  @xmath17 , and [ fe / h ] had been estimated , we relied on the model atmosphere grid point closest in these variables , paying special attention to the primary variable , temperature .",
    "in the case of more than one close match , we employed the template that gave the highest value for the peak correlation , averaged over all the observed spectra .",
    "estimation of stellar atmospheric parameters follows the procedures described by c2003 .",
    "we make use of photometric methods to compute effective temperatures and bolometric corrections , and we require , therefore , good estimates of the interstellar extinction .",
    "we adopted the @xmath1 and e(@xmath20 ) values directly from att , except for hd  6833 , for which att did not derive such parameters , and hde  232078 , which att did not study .",
    "both stars lie at low galactic latitude ( @xmath21 = @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ) , and are quite distant , so reddening is a special problem .",
    "table  1 summarizes the photometry employed in our work .",
    "the @xmath24 photometry is on the cousins system .",
    "thanks to the 2mass point source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , we were able to find @xmath25 photometry for all of our new program stars , although we transformed the 2mass @xmath26 magnitudes to the  cit \" system following the prescription given in the explanatory supplement to the 2mass second incremental data release , followed by a transformation to the  tcs \" systems as described by alonso et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "temperature estimates were obtained using the color-@xmath16 relations derived by alonso , arribas , & martinez roger ( 1999 , 2001 ) , based on infrared flux method determinations .",
    "the published relations employ the  tcs \" system @xmath25 colors , and johnson @xmath24 colors , so we transformed the ( @xmath24)@xmath27 values of table  1 into the johnson system , using the relations given by fernie ( 1983 ) .",
    "when more than one temperature estimate was available , as was most often the case , we employed a simple mean .",
    "the average rms scatter when three or more temperatures estimates are available is 45  k.    we assumed stellar masses of 0.8 , appropriate for stars at the main sequence turn - off in globular clusters .",
    "calculation of gravities then followed from the @xmath28 values , transformed to @xmath29 after addition of the bolometric correction ( alonso et al .",
    "table  2 summarizes the resultant atmospheric parameters for our program stars .      to estimate the interstellar extinction to hd  6833",
    ", we exploited the spectroscopic study by fulbright ( 2000 ) , who derived @xmath16 = 4450  k , log  @xmath17 = 1.4 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath30 .",
    "the star has @xmath31 = 6.75 and @xmath32 = 1.17 , and its metallicity is a near - perfect match for that of ngc  6723 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath33 kraft & ivans 2003 ) . to obtain the same effective temperature from the alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) calibrations requires e(@xmath32 ) = 0.11 [ e(@xmath20 ) = 0.076 ] , so ( @xmath32)@xmath34 = 1.06 .",
    "the available color - magnitude diagram of the cluster reveals that m@xmath35 at that color , which we adopt .",
    "note that as a result , our photometric estimate of log  @xmath17 is 1.6 , quite similar to that obtained by fulbright ( 2000 ) , who derived a value of 1.4 .    in the case of hde  232078 , we relied on the analysis by burris et al .",
    "they determined the temperature and metallicity using spectroscopic methods , but employed photometry to estimate the gravity , finding @xmath36 , log  @xmath17 = + 0.3 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath37 .",
    "these values enable us to determine the interstellar extinction , under the assumption that the alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) color - temperature calibration should yield the same temperature if we have estimated the reddening correctly .",
    "the globular cluster m3 has nearly identical metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath38 ; kraft et al .",
    "1992 ) , and a very low reddening [ e(@xmath32 ) = 0.01 mag ] , so in principle we only need to use the alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) relations between @xmath25 and @xmath16 to estimate temperatures of its red giants",
    ". then we simply identify ( @xmath25)@xmath34 for stars with the same effective temperature as hde  232078 . using available unpublished m3",
    "@xmath39 photometry and 2mass @xmath26 magnitudes , we obtain e(@xmath32 ) = 0.56 mag for hde  232078 , as well as @xmath1 = @xmath40 .",
    "our photometric estimate for the gravity is log  @xmath17 = + 0.6 , somewhat higher than that estimated by burris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we rely on the photometric estimation of @xmath1 values and bolometric corrections to estimate the gravities of our program stars , so we must ask how accurate such estimates are , especially given the relatively large distances to our program stars .",
    "we have two methods available : trigonometric parallaxes from hipparcos , and spectroscopic gravities derived during the course of metallicity determinations .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] plots @xmath1 values estimated by att and , in the special cases here and in c2003 , by us , against those derived directly from trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the 1@xmath41 error bars are almost all very large , since typical parallaxes are only one to two milli - arcseconds , and the uncertainties are often comparable to or even larger than the parallaxes , so that the formal error encompasses physically unrealistic negative parallaxes .",
    "we have not plotted the 16 stars with negative parallaxes , nor the 9 stars whose resultant @xmath1 values are brigher than @xmath42 mag since those stars are more luminous than the red giant branch tip stars in globular clusters .",
    "all 9 stars have very large errors in @xmath1 , the smallest value being 4.85 mag .",
    "for the remaining stars whose error bars result in negative parallaxes , we have applied very large error bars so that they run off the left edge of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we acknowledge that the figure is not particularly helpful , but does merit some scrutiny .",
    "for example , there are a number of stars for which the parallaxes predict much fainter absolute magnitudes and , therefore , much higher gravities .",
    "we have identified three such stars in particular : bd+3  2782 ( @xmath43 = @xmath44 ;",
    "@xmath45 = @xmath46 ) ; hd  85773 ( @xmath43 = @xmath47 ; @xmath45 = @xmath48 ) ; and hd  184711 ( @xmath43 = @xmath49 ; @xmath45 = @xmath50 ) . for these three stars , gratton et al .  ( 1996 ) employed ionization balance to estimate gravities from high - resolution , high - s / n spectra . our photometry - based gravities for these three stars are , respectively , log  @xmath17 = + 1.3 , + 0.90 , and + 0.59 , consistent with high luminosity .",
    "gratton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtained + 1.28 , + 0.48 , and + 0.15 , even lower gravities , implying even higher luminosities for hd  85773 and hd  184711 than we have estimated .",
    "we believe the few disagreements between our derived @xmath1 values and those obtained from parallaxes reflect the uncertainties at the limit of the hipparcos mission capabilities .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] continues the comparisons of spectroscopic and photometric gravities , relying on gratton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as well as fulbright ( 2000 ) .",
    "the figure reveals that the gravities derived by gratton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are lower than the photometric estimates for almost all of the lowest gravity , highest luminosity stars .",
    "agreement with fulbright ( 2000 ) , however , is much better .",
    "a least squares fit results in a slope of almost unity ( 0.92 ) and modest offset ( 0.04 dex ) , and , in particular , a small scatter ( @xmath51  dex ) .",
    "that level of scatter is very satisfying given the difficulties of estimating @xmath1 and , similarly , in determining spectroscopic gravities .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows how our adopted [ fe / h ] values , based primarily on the strmgren photometry calibrations from att , compare with results obtained from classical fine analyses of high - s / n , high - resolution spectra of gratton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and fulbright ( 2002 ) .",
    "the mean offset in [ fe / h ] between our adopted values and the 26 stars in common with gratton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for our entire survey ( carney et al .",
    "2003 and this paper ) is @xmath52 dex , with @xmath53 dex , in the sense our results minus those of gratton et al . for fulbright ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the offset for 23 stars in common is @xmath54 dex , @xmath55 dex .",
    "both of these results are comparable to the mean difference between the 12 stars in our program that are common to both gratton et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and fulbright ( 2000 ) : @xmath56[fe / h]@xmath57 - [ fe / h]@xmath58 = @xmath59 , @xmath60 dex .    figures  [ fig1 ] through [ fig3 ] give us confidence that our gravity , luminosity , and metallicity estimations are , in general , quite good .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] plots the derived temperatures and gravities for our program stars vs.  the 14 gyr model isochrones of straniero & chieffi ( 1991 ) .",
    "the two panels show the stars discussed in this paper , and the combined results from this paper plus those stars studied by c2003 .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the data points and the isochrones on the rgb , suggesting again that our derived atmospheric parameters are quite plausible .",
    "the reader may have noted ( as did the referee ) that the match to the isochrones in figure  [ fig4 ] is not perfect , with stars whose gravities are only slightly lower than those of horizontal branch hovering nearer the hotter , more metal - poor isochrones than are most of the lowest - gravity stars .",
    "there are several potential contributing factors at work .",
    "for one , the two sets of stars have slightly different metallicities .",
    "the 25 stars with log  @xmath61 have @xmath56[fe / h]@xmath62 = @xmath63 ( @xmath41 = 0.31 ) , while the 35 stars with 1.6 @xmath9 log  @xmath17 @xmath64 have @xmath56[fe / h]@xmath62 = @xmath65 ( @xmath41 = 0.57 ) .",
    "so a modest shift to more metal - poor isochrones is expected .",
    "but there are subtle systematic effects that may also contribute .",
    "for example , the lower gravity stars are more luminous and intrinsically rarer , and , hence , more distant .",
    "reddenings may be more susceptible to systematic errors . and the color - temperature transformations may not be as well calibrated in one gravity domain compared to another .",
    "we judge the overall agreement between our estimated gravities and temperatures compared to the model isochrones to satisfy the basic test that , on balance , we have reliable stellar atmospheric parameters for our stars .",
    "we used these derived atmospheric parameters to select the optimum synthetic spectrum to derive both the radial velocities and the line broadening .",
    "the average correlation value was computed for all the observed spectra of each star using all available rotationally - broadened templates with the adopted values of temperature , gravity and metallicity . the template with rotational broadening that yielded the highest average correlation",
    "was chosen for final use in all the radial velocity measures .",
    "the final column of table  2 includes @xmath16 , log  @xmath17 , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath66 for the synthetic spectrum employed .",
    "table  3 provides the individual heliocentric radial velocity results derived for each star using the tool * rvsao * ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) running inside the iraf environment .",
    "the electronic version of the table includes _ all _ the radial velocities from c2003 as well as those obtained from this survey .",
    "we do this primarily for the convenience of the reader , and to assure ourselves that all the data have been treated consistently .",
    "the results quoted in table  3 reflect only the internal errors .",
    "the reader should also be aware that the velocities are on the  native cfa \" system defined by our grid of synthetic spectra and nightly observations of the dawn and dusk sky . to transfer these values to an absolute system defined by observations of minor planets ,",
    "0.139  should be added to these values ( stefanik 1999 ) .",
    "gravitational redshifts have also been neglected .",
    "table  4 summarizes the new results for the 11 stars from c2003 which we have continued to observe , while table  5 does the same for the new program stars . in both cases",
    ", we list the number of observations , the span of the observations in days , the mean radial velocity , and the uncertainty of the mean velocity .",
    "note that for the binary stars , the mean radial velocity is not as appropriate as the systemic velocity that emerges from the orbital solution . for stars with orbital solutions , we therefore list here the systemic velocity and its uncertainty .",
    "we also list the measured rms external error , e , and i , the mean of the internal errors , @xmath67 , of the velocity measurements ( see kurtz & mink 1998 ) .",
    "we also show the ratio , e / i , since large values of e / i ( @xmath68 ) are suggestive of radial - velocity variability .",
    "as discussed by c2003 , another powerful indicator of radial velocity variability is the probability , p(@xmath69 ) , that the @xmath69 value could be larger than observed due to gaussian errors for a star that actually has constant velocity .",
    "we employ the internal error estimate , @xmath67 , for each of @xmath70 exposures when calculating @xmath71 : @xmath72 the values of @xmath73 are computed by * rvsao*. if these internal error estimates are correct and the actual errors are gaussian , then the distribution of p(@xmath69 ) should be constant from 0 to 1 , except for the velocity variables occupying the region near zero probability . however , we found that use of the internal error estimates led to a distribution of p(@xmath69 ) values that was not flat for p(@xmath69)@xmath74 . since a flat distribution is expected , we found it necessary to add in quadrature a  floor error \" of 0.25  to each internal error estimate .",

    "three stars , hd  97 , hd  3179 , and hd  213467 , continue to have low p(@xmath69 ) values , but other than one or two deviant velocities , appear to have stable velocities , and it is therefore hard to ascribe the apparent variability as due to either orbital motion or velocity jitter .",

    "hd  6833 , hd  29574 , bd+1  2916 ,",
    "hd  165195 , and hde  232078 all have good velocity coverage and 14 or more measured velocities , and all have very low p(@xmath69 ) values ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "none show any signs of periodicity in their velocities .",
    "all of them , except hd  6833 , are judged to be luminous , with @xmath84 , so velocity jitter seems to be the best explanation .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] is an update of figure  8 in c2003 , with the stars from table  5 added .",
    "binary stars are shown as triangles ; non - binary stars as circles .",
    "all stars with p(@xmath69 ) @xmath85 are plotted as filled triangles or circles .",
    "we have not included hd  4306 because it is uncertain if the very low p(@xmath69 ) value is due to its orbital motion , jitter , or both .",
    "its low luminosity ( @xmath86 ) and its velocity vs.  time behavior ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) suggest that only orbital motion is at work , but until we have a reliable orbital solution , we can not say for certain .",
    "the most striking feature of figure  [ fig8 ] is that the lowest p(@xmath69 ) values , @xmath87 , are restricted to the most luminous stars , those with @xmath4 .",
    "the second striking feature is that not all stars with such luminosities manifest velocity jitter .",
    "we have included binary stars with orbital solutions , and their p(@xmath69 ) were recomputed following application of the orbital solution ( see the discussion in c2003 ) .",
    "thus the p(@xmath69 ) values are a measure of non - orbital sources of velocity variability .",
    "we find that only 3 of the 14 stars with estimated @xmath88 show p(@xmath69 ) values of less than @xmath89 .",
    "but _ all seven _ of the stars with estimated @xmath1 values of less than @xmath2 do show jitter .",
    "our estimated @xmath1 values do not have sufficient precision to ascertain if velocity jitter  turns on \" at a particular luminosity or gravity , but that is a reasonable speculation .",
    "finally , we note the remaining challenge presented by the three lower luminosity / higher gravity stars with p(@xmath69 ) @xmath90 . as noted previously , hd  97 and hd  213467 ( @xmath1 = + 1.4 and + 1.7 , respectively ) may have low p(@xmath69 ) values due to one or two poor radial velocity measures .",
    "hd  6833 , however , does appear to be a legitimate low - luminosity star with variable velocity that has not , as yet , been coupled with orbital motion .",
    "our estimated gravity , log  @xmath17 = @xmath91 , agrees well with that obtained spectroscopically by fulbright ( 2006 ) , log  @xmath17 = 1.4 .",
    "perhaps additional radial velocity monitoring would reveal the star to be a binary .",
    "we have estimated the line broadening , @xmath66 , following the procedures described by c2003 . for each star we selected the synthetic spectrum for use as a template that best matches the derived temperature , gravity , and metallicity parameters , and then chose the rotational broadening value which produced the highest average correlation value .",
    "we interpolated the derived correlation values for the two velocities adjacent to the preferred value using a quadratic fit .",
    "the derived @xmath66 values are listed in the final column of tables  4 and 5 .",
    "the typical standard error in these values derived from the individual spectra ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 , so the mean values are well determined , at least internally .",
    "the systematic effects were also discussed by c2003 .",
    "basically , changes of 250  k in temperature , 0.5 dex in gravity , or 0.5 dex in metallicity , individually led to velocity sensitivities of 3.0 , 3.2 , and 3.3 , independent of the derived line broadening .",
    "the synthetic spectra were all computed using a macroturbulent velocity of 3  , but low gravity stars may have higher turbulent velocities ( see gray 1982 ; gray & pallavicini 1989 ) .",
    "the line broadening values for more luminous stars would be expected to be affected more strongly by macroturbulence at the higher luminosities .",
    "values that are well below our instrumental resolution are more vulnerable to these uncertain systematic effects .",
    "the referee has inquired about observing conditions when the star underfills the spectrograph s slit , which may lead to a higher instrumental resolving power than we have assumed .",
    "for spectra obtained in massachusetts , ( identified by  w \" in the detailed velocity summary ) , the seeing always overfilled the slit by a factor of two or more . in arizona ( identified by ",
    "t \" or  m \" ) , there were occasional times when the slit was underfilled .",
    "we compared line broadening results for those stars with spectra obtained in both arizona and massachusetts and found no discernible differences .",
    "the first question we ask is whether our results are in reasonable agreement with other studies , especially those obtained using higher spectral resolution and higher s / n .",
    "we have made comparisons with three such studies .",
    "we have fifteen stars in common with behr ( 2003 ) , with a span in @xmath66 from about 3 to 21 .",
    "behr s observations included higher resolving power , 60,000 ( about 5.0 ) , higher s / n ( for the stars in common , his cumulative s / n for the stars ranged from 40 to 200 , with 60 being a typical value ) , and greater wavelength coverage ( 1000 to 1500  ) .",
    "nonetheless , despite our limited wavelength coverage , lower resolving power , and lower s / n observations , a linear least squares bissector analysis results in @xmath92 the scatter about this relation is only 1.2 .",
    "taking the 15 stars in a star - to - star comparison shows a mean difference in the values of only 0.6 , again , a scatter of 1.2 .",
    "( the sense is cfa results minus those of behr 2003 . )",
    "if we restrict the comparison to only the 7 stars for which our results suggest @xmath6  sin  @xmath7 @xmath93 , the mean offset is only 0.3 , with @xmath94 .",
    "we compare the results from this paper and from c2003 with the sample of 20 stars for which we obtained spectra with very high resolving power ( 150,000 , or 2.0 ) and very high s /",
    "n ( generally over 200 ) using the gecko spectrograph on the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "details may be found in another paper ( carney et al .",

    "combined \" measure of line broadening , @xmath66 , we treat both values as gaussians , which is not strictly correct , since the macroturbulent dispersion , @xmath95 , does not behave as a gaussian .",

    "( 2007 ) , and as in their study , our value of @xmath97 was determined empirically , such that the mean offset between the @xmath98 and @xmath99 values was minimized .",
    "we found the best agreement when @xmath97 is 0.95 , at least for the current sample of metal - poor giants .",
    "for the seven stars with @xmath100 , the mean offset is @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "for the eight stars with @xmath103 , the mean offset is @xmath104 , with @xmath105 , and for all fifteen stars , the mean offset is @xmath106 , @xmath94 .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig9 ] compares the results from behr ( 2003 ) and our cfht program with those of this paper and c2003 . for the cfht sample",
    ", we have eliminated the five variable stars since the temperatures and gravities derived from photometry may be less reliable . for three stars , hd  25532 , hd  184266 , and hd  195636",
    ", line broadening was determined by both behr ( 2003 ) and from our cfht data , and we have drawn lines connecting the two sets of results .",
    "agreement is excellent , even well below our instrumental resolution of 8.5 .",
    "another recent study is that of de  medeiros et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who measured @xmath6  sin  @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) values at a typical resolving power of 50,000 ( 6.0 ) , s / n @xmath107 , and wavelength coverage spanning @xmath1083500 - 9200 .",
    "their work had 22 stars in common with c2003 , and with the results from the present paper , there are 35 stars in common .",
    "the range in  rotational velocities \" is more limited , despite the larger sample size . for only three of the stars in common",
    "have we obtained a @xmath66 value larger than our resolving power , and the largest of those is only 11.7 .",

    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig9 ] shows the comparison graphically .",
    "as the quantitative comparisons found , the scatter appears to be larger in the bottom panel than in the top panel , although most of these comparisons are for stars whose line broadening values are comparable to or smaller than either our instrumental resolution or that of de  medeiros et al .  ( 2006 ) .",
    "we note that de  medeiros et al .",
    "( 2006 ) compared their results with those of behr ( 2003 ) .",
    "taking straight differences , we find a mean difference , in the sense of de  medeiros et al .",
    "( 2006 ) minus behr ( 2003 ) , of @xmath112 , with @xmath113 , for the eight stars common to both programs .",
    "the scatter somewhat larger than the value of 1.4 that de  medeiros et al .  quoted for comparisons of all the stars common to c2003 , behr ( 2003 ) , and peterson ( 1983 ) .",
    "we conclude that our results are in good agreement with all of the above other studies , although perhaps somewhat better with behr ( 2003 ) than with de  medeiros et al .",
    "considering that our spectra have much lower resolution , much lower s / n , and much smaller wavelength coverage , the power of synthetic spectrum templates is apparent .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows the line broadening for the stars from table  5 ( left ) , and those stars plus the results from c2003 ( right ) .",
    "the 45 stars for which we have obtained new results behave the same as the 91 stars studied by c2003 .",
    "specifically , stars with @xmath114 show systematically higher levels of line broadening than the fainter stars . as noted earlier , c2003 speculated that while some of the cases might be due to tidal locking in a binary system37  14010 , with @xmath1 = @xmath115 , @xmath66 = 19.4 , and an orbital period of 65.55 days . ] , some of the apparently elevated line broadening might be due to increased rotation due to the absorption of a giant planet that had an orbital separation of about one au .",
    "this idea was also consistent with the generally high levels of line broadening seen in the rhb stars , which are , of course , the direct descendents of some of the rgb tip stars .",
    "the significant line broadening of many of the rhb stars in our program is also apparent in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "line broadening may also be due to macroturbulence .",
    "c2003 dismissed this as a cause because the levels of macroturbulence necessary to provide a total line broadening of 9 to 10  and higher seemed improbable .",
    "gray ( 1982 ) and gray & pallavicini ( 1989 ) reported macroturbulent velocities for k giants ( luminosity class iii ) , and all values were smaller than 6.5 . even considering luminosity classes ii - iii and ii , gray & toner ( 1986 ) found macroturbulent velocities to be smaller than 8 .",
    "however , these results were derived from studies of metal - rich disk stars .",
    "an obvious question is whether lower - mass , older , more metal - poor halo giants have elevated levels of macroturbulence compared to disk giants .",
    "carney et al .  (",
    "2007 ) do not , in fact , find significant differences in @xmath95 between metal - rich disk and metal - poor halo red giants .",
    "what about velocity jitter ?",
    "let us consider only the rgb stars and exclude the known binary systems , where tidal interactions may have contributed to the rotation and line broadening .",
    "we have noted that velocity jitter begins to appear at only the highest luminosities , @xmath4 , and especially for @xmath116 .",
    "these are also the luminosity levels for which line broadening measures are highest . in figure  [ fig11 ]",
    "we replace luminosity with log  p(@xmath69 ) and compare directly with @xmath66 .",
    "open red circles are stars with @xmath117 . filled red circles are stars with @xmath118 .",
    "as the figure shows , some of the luminous rgb stars have normal p(@xmath69 ) and modest but typical line broadening .",
    "however , a significant number of the most luminous stars have very low values of p(@xmath69 ) , and they also tend to have much higher than average values of @xmath66 . in other words , it appears that there is a strong correlation between velocity jitter and line broadening .",
    "this is not a matter of  velocity smearing \" during individual observations .",
    "the exposure times are far too short , typically a few minutes , compared to the physical timescales for major atmospheric changes in very large red giant stars ( with timescales of days to months ) .",
    "this figure suggests that velocity jitter and line broadening share a common cause .",
    "how do we explain the significant line broadening measured for the rhb stars ?",
    "rotation may play a significant role , but we suspect the macroturbulence contributes to the broadening .",
    "gray ( 1982 ) first noted the correlation between macroturbulent velocities and effective temperature in giant stars , with @xmath95 rising from around 4  for k2  iii stars to 7  for g2  iii stars .",
    "gray & toner ( 1986 ) found similar behavior for bright giants , luminosity classes ii and ii - iii .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows our measured line broadening for rhb stars as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "qualitatively , the trend matches the expected increase in @xmath95 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "there are quantitative difficulties , however , since the line broadening seen among the rhb stars is much larger than the macroturbulent velocities seen in metal - rich disk giants .",
    "rotation should certainly not be ruled out , either .",
    "if the most luminous rgb stars have only very modest levels of rotation , their smaller descendents should have significant rotation .",
    "very high - resolution , high - s / n spectra of such stars will enable us to explore the roles of rotation and macroturbulence in both rgb and rhb stars .",
    "we have obtained 349 new radial velocities and line broadening measures for 45 metal - poor rgb and rhb stars , as well as 57 such measures for 11 of the stars we studied previously ( c2003 ) . a comparison of our derived values for line broadening with results from behr ( 2003 ) and de  medeiros et al .",
    "( 2006 ) shows that our lower - resolution , lower - s / n , and limited wavelength coverage spectra yield excellent results .",
    "we believe the good agreement testifies to the power of high - resolution synthetic spectra as templates .",
    "we have identified one new spectroscopic binary , hd  4306 , and a possible second one , hd  184711 , although we note that the latter s radial velocity variability may be due to velocity jitter rather than orbital motion .",
    "we draw attention to the observed correlation between variable radial velocity (  jitter \" ) and line broadening .",
    "the significant line broadening seen in the metal - poor field rhb stars is hard to explain : it may be a combination of  spin up \" when a slowly rotating luminous rgb star settles on to the horizontal branch , or temperature - dependent macroturbulence may be involved .",
    "very high - resolution and very high - s / n spectroscopy should reveal the relative balance of rotation and macroturbulence in rgb and rhb stars .",
