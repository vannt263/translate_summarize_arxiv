    "recently there is a growing evidence of the supermagnetized neutron stars with the magnetic fields of @xmath2 g , the so - called magnetars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although such stars are estimated to be only a subclass ( @xmath3 ) of the canonical neutron stars with @xmath4 g @xcite , much attention has been paid to this objects because there remain many astrophysically exciting but unresolved problems .",
    "giant flaring activities observed during the past @xmath520 years have given us good opportunities to study the coupling of the interior to the magnetospheric structures of magnetars @xcite , but the relationship between the crustal fraction and the subsequent starquarks has not yet been clarified ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the large magnetic field is also a big problem , whether generated at post - collapse in the rapidly neutron star @xcite or descend from the main sequence stars @xcite . assuming the large magnetic fields before core - collapse , extensive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) stellar collapse simulations have been done recently @xcite in order to understand the formation mechanism of magnetars with the different levels of the sophistication in the treatment of the equations of state ( eoss ) , the neutrino transport , and the general relativity ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "here it is worth mentioning that the gravitational waves from magnetars could be a useful tool giving us an information about the magnetar interiors @xcite . while in a microscopic point of view , the effects of magnetic field larger than the so - called qed limit of @xmath6 , on the eoss ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the radiation processes have been also extensively investigated ( see @xcite for a review ) . for the understanding of the formation and evolution of the magnetars ,",
    "it is indispensable to unify these macroscopic and microscopic studies together , albeit not an easy job .",
    "when one tries to study the above interesting issues , the construction of an equilibrium configuration of magnetars may be one of the most fundamental problems , thus has been extensively investigated since the pioneering study by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied the equilibrium configurations of an incompressible star with the poloidal fields .",
    "@xcite then succeeded to take into account the toroidal fields .",
    "@xcite extended prendergast s work to the compressible one .",
    "@xcite and @xcite improved a boundary condition of the poloidal fields .",
    "note that all these works mentioned above were based on the perturbation approach in which one assumes the magnetic field is sufficiently weak . @xcite and @xcite developed techniques to treat a strong magnetic field beyond the perturbative approach with the newtonian gravity .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite developed the scheme with the general relativistic framework .",
    "here it should be noted that the studies mentioned above have contained two drawbacks to be modified . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the magnetic fields are assumed to vanish at the stellar surface and such a condition may be somewhat unrealistic . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "only poloidal fields have been considered .",
    "it has been pointed out that such a purely poloidal field will be unstable and will decay within several alfvn times @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite recently find by the 3d numerical simulations that the pure poloidal fields certainly decay within several alfvn times and the configurations consisted both of poloidal and toroidal ones with comparable strength can be only stable .",
    "recently , @xcite established a new non - perturbative method , which has conquered the above drawbacks . in the scheme ,",
    "one can obtain a solution with a natural boundary condition , in which the magnetic field vanishes at the infinity .",
    "moreover , one can treat both poloidal and toroidal fields simultaneously .",
    "more recently , @xcite calculated a number of sequences of magnetized rotating star and discussed their basic properties .",
    "extending the tomimura - eriguchi scheme to treat the differential rotation , @xcite found that the magnetic fields can be in a twisted - torus equilibrium structure and discussed the universality of such structures .",
    "there may still remain a room to be sophisticated in their studies @xcite that the polytropic eoss have been used for simplicity .",
    "in general , the central density of the neutron stars is considered to be higher than the nuclear density @xcite . since we still do not have an answer about the eos in such a higher regime ,",
    "many kinds of the nuclear eoss have been proposed ( e.g. , @xcite ) depending on the descriptions of the nuclear forces and the possible appearance of the exotic physics ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the stiffness of the polytropic eos has been treated to be globally constant inside the star",
    ", it should depend on the density in the realistic eoss .",
    "remembering that the equilibrium configurations are achieved by the subtle and local balance of the gravitational force , centrifugal force , the lorentz force , and the pressure gradient , it is a nontrivial problem how the equilibrium configurations change for the realistic eoss .",
    "therefore the first purpose in this paper is to extend the studies of @xcite and @xcite to incorporate the realistic eoss and discuss the equilibrium properties .",
    "four kinds of eoss of sly @xcite , fps @xcite , shen @xcite , and lattimer - swesty @xcite are adopted , which are often employed in the recent literatures of the mhd studies mentioned above .",
    "in contrast to the case of the polytropic eos , a maximum density enters as a new parameter . at first , we set this value as comparable as the nuclear density of @xmath7 , because the general relativistic ( gr ) corrections are rather small at this density regime as will be mentioned .",
    "if a maximum density of star is much larger than the nuclear density , we must take account into a gr effect .",
    "however , the fully gr approach to the magnetized equilibrium configuration has not been established yet except for the purely poloidal fields @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider here a new approach to take into account a gr effect approximately and see their effects on the equilibrium configurations .",
    "this is the second purpose of this paper . applying this method",
    ", we furthermore compute equilibrium sequences at finite temperature , which should serve as an initial condition for the hydrodynamic evolutionary studies of newly - born magnetars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ basic ]",
    ", we shall briefly summarize the basic equations , the numerical scheme and the employed equations of state .",
    "numerical results and their analysis are presented in section  [ result ] .",
    "summary and discussion follow in section  [ conc ] .",
    "the basic equations describing an equilibrium state of a perfect conductive fluid are summarized according to @xcite : +   + 1 .",
    "maxwell s equations : @xmath8 where we use gaussian units , with the charge and current densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 both measured in electrostatic units .",

    "poisson equation for the gravitational potential : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gravitational constant .    in order to obtain stationary states of magnetized stars ,",
    "the following assumptions are adopted in this frame work:(1 ) the magnetic axis and the rotation axis are aligned .",
    "( 2 ) the matter and the magnetic field distributions are axisymmetric about this axis .",
    "( 3 ) the sources of the magnetic fields , i.e. , the current distributions are confined to within the stars . for the sake of simplicity we require two additional conditions that are not necessary to have stationary solutions .",
    "( 4 ) the meridional circulation of the fluid is neglected .",
    "consequently , the fluid flow can be described by the angular velocity @xmath26 only , which is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 stands for the rotational killing vector . due to this assumptions and the axisymmetric assumption , the mass conservation equation  ( [ eq6 ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "( 5 ) the barotropic equation of state , @xmath29 , is adopted .",
    "although we employ realistic equations of state in this paper , this barotropic condition can be maintained as explained in subsection [ eos ] .    under these assumptions ,",

    "concerning the functions characterizing the magnetic field distributions , we choose the following forms : @xmath54 where @xmath45 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are arbitrary constants and @xmath57 is the maximum value of @xmath30 in the vacuum region . here",

    "the parameter @xmath83 is directly involved in the bernoulli equation  ( [ eq22 ] ) and plays a role to determine the matter distribution .",
    "increasing of @xmath55 enhances magnitude of magnetic field @xmath30 through the generalized grad - shafranov equation ( [ eq21 ] ) .",

    "note that @xmath84 means that the magnetic field has the poloidal component only , however @xmath85 _ does not mean _ that there exists only toroidal component ( see equation  ( [ eq11 ] ) , ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) ) .      as mentioned in section",
    "[ intro ] , equation of state ( eos ) is an important ingredient for determining the equilibrium configurations . before conducting an extensive study as done before for the studies of rotating equilibrium configurations in which more variety of eoss were employed ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , we adopt here four kinds of eoss of sly @xcite , fps @xcite , shen @xcite , and lattimer - swesty @xcite which are often employed in the recent mhd studies relevant for magnetars .    in the study of cold neutron stars ,",
    "the @xmath65-equilibrium condition with respect to beta decays of the form @xmath86 and @xmath87 , can be well validated as for the static properties . since neutrinos and antineutrinos escape from the star their chemical potentials vanish at zero - temperature @xmath88 with @xmath69 being the temperature , and",
    "the equilibrium condition is @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 being the chemical potentials of neutron , electron , and proton , respectively . with the charge neutrality condition",
    ", we can determine the three independent thermodynamic variables , ( for example the pressure as @xmath93 with @xmath94 being the electron fraction ) , can only be determined by a single variable , which we take to be the density , namely @xmath95 @xcite , noting here that @xmath88 is assumed for the case of the cold neutron stars . thanks to this , we can use the formalism mentioned in section 2 without violating the barotropic condition of the eoss . at the maximum densities",
    "higher than @xmath96 , muons can appear , and higher than @xmath97 @xcite , one may take into possible appearance of hyperons @xcite .",
    "however , since the muon contribution to pressure at the higher density has been pointed to be very small @xcite , and we still do not have detailed knowledge of the hyperon interactions , we prefer to employ the above neutron star matter , namely @xmath98 , model to higher densities . in the following ,",
    "we shortly summarize features of the eoss employed here .",
    "lattimer - swesty eos @xcite is the one which has been used these years as a standard in the research field of core - collapse supernova explosions and the subsequent neutron star formations ( see references in @xcite ) , which is based on the compressible drop model for nuclei together with dripped nucleons .",
    "the values of nuclear parameters are chosen according to nuclear mass formulae and other theoretical studies with the skyrme interaction .",
    "shen eos @xcite is the rather modern one currently often used in the research field , which is based on the relativistic mean field theory with a local density approximations , which has been constructed to reproduce the experimental data of masses and radii of stable and unstable nuclei ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "fps are modern version of an earlier microscopic eos calculations by @xcite , which employs both two body ( u14 ) and three - body interactions ( tni ) . in the sly eos @xcite , neutron - excess dependence",
    "is added to the fps eos , which is more suitable for the neutron star interiors . as for the fps and sly eoss",
    ", we use the fitting formulae presented in @xcite . in the upper panel of figure [ adindex ]",
    ", we plot the pressure @xmath99 as a function of the rest - mass density @xmath19 for the eoss .",
    "in the bottom panel , we plot the adiabatic index , defined by @xmath100 which can be a useful tool not only to characterize the stiffness but also to see their effects on the equilibrium configurations .",
    "as seen , the adiabatic index as a function of the density is far away from constant as in the case of the polytropic eos , showing an increasing ( but sometimes zigzag ) trend up to the several nuclear density ( for example @xmath101 of sly ) and decreases slowly at higher densities due to the interplay of the density dependence of the nuclear interactions and of increasing proton fractions .",
    "note that the relatively large discrepancies of the pressure below @xmath102 and the zigzag features of the adiabatic indices are due to the difference in the treatment of the inhomogeneous matter consisted of electrons , protons , free nucleons , and a species of heavy nuclei , and these are pointed out to have little effects on determining the equilibrium configurations which predominantly determined by the behavior of the eoss at higher densities @xcite .",
    "( bottom ) as a function of rest - mass density for sly @xcite , fps @xcite , shen @xcite , and ls @xcite ( ls ) eoss , respectively .",

    "as mentioned , the first purpose of this study is to investigate the basic properties of magnetized rotating stars with the four kinds of eoss in newtonian gravity . in all the calculations ,",
    "the value of @xmath56 ( equation  ( [ eq26 ] ) ) is set to be @xmath105 because this choice makes the maximum toroidal fields to be comparable to the poloidal ones @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that one should specify the maximum density when using the realistic eoss , while the degree of freedom of this choice can be eliminated in case of the polytropic eoss because one can choose the polytropic constant freely .",
    "we actually fix its value as @xmath106 close to the nuclear density .        for clarity",
    ", we categorize the equilibrium configurations to two types of non - rotating type and rotating one . for non - rotating sequence , the parameters , axis ratio @xmath75 and @xmath55 , are input and kept fixed during calculation and then the parameters , @xmath65 , @xmath107 , and @xmath83 are obtained as output . for rotating sequence , @xmath75 , @xmath55 , and @xmath83",
    "are input and kept fixed , then @xmath65 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 are obtained as outcome .",
    "we first concentrate on the non - rotating sequences , in which the anisotropic magnetic stress is only the agent to deform the stars . in table",
    "[ real - non - rot - mix ] , various physical quantities corresponding to the previous studies @xcite are given for the four kinds of eoss .",
    "as a model parameter , we set @xmath109 because we are interested in the combination effects of poloidal and toroidal fields .",
    "note again that the choice of @xmath84 leads to the unstable pure poloidal configurations as mentioned .    as shown in the table , the values of @xmath110 for",
    "the sequences become large enough to be @xmath105 when the stars sufficiently deform typically @xmath75 of the axis ratio to be @xmath111 .",
    "in such a region , the perturbative approach may break down and a non - perturbative taken here is valid . lowering the axis ratio , it can be seen that all sequences can achieve nearly toroidal density configuration , @xmath112 due to the strong lorentz forces .",
    "in fact , @xmath110 increases as the axis ratio @xmath75 decreases as shown in figure [ q - h ] .",
    "this feature does not depend on the eoss .",
    "furthermore we find the values of @xmath110 for sly or fps sequences is greater than the those for shen or ls sequences for any axis ratio .",
    "this tendency is explained with respect to the stiffness of the eoss . as seen from the bottom panel of figure 1 , shen or ls eoss",

    ", we can see clearly the effects of stronger magnetic field . from the tables , it can be seen that there exist maximum ( @xmath120 ) and minimum ( @xmath121 ) values in the axis ratio @xmath75 .",
    "this feature does not appear in the sequence only with the magnetic fields ( see subsection [ smc ] ) , in which we can find the physical solutions for any values of @xmath75 ( see table  [ real - non - rot - mix ] ) .",
    "equilibrium configurations which have larger axis ratio than @xmath120 have @xmath122 and such configurations are of course unphysical .",
    "too strong magnetic field causes such a configuration , in which ",
    "anti-centrifugal force is needed . on the other hand ,",
    "configurations with smaller @xmath75 than @xmath121 belong to following two types : ( 1 ) due to too strong lorentz forces , the converged solutions have @xmath123 as explained above .",
    "( 2 ) the mass of the star sheds from the equatorial surface because the centrifugal forces are too strong ( ms in the table indicates the so - called mass - shedding ) .",
    "following @xcite , we call the sequence ending in the former and the latter type as magnetic - field - dominated ( * md * ) and rotation - dominated ( * rd * ) sequence , respectively .",
    "it is noted that larger values of @xmath83 make @xmath120 smaller ( compare table [ real - rot - mix ] with [ real - mag - mix ] ) because @xmath120 is determined by the magnetic field strength .",
    "so , all the sequences shown in table  [ real - rot - mix ] belong to the rd sequence regardless of the eoss , but not for the sequences in table  [ real - mag - mix ] . the sequences with sly or fps eoss",
    "belong to rd type and those with shen or ls eoss belong to md type . as like this",
    ", even if we set the same parameter of @xmath55 and @xmath83 , it is found that the type of the sequence depends on the eoss .    in order to see this feature more clearly",
    ", we perform a parameter search in @xmath124 parameter space and classify the sequences . in figure",
    "[ phase ] , we show a set of phase diagrams on @xmath124 plane with different eoss . in the figure , the region with @xmath123 shows that we can not obtain any solutions except one with negative angular velocity .",
    "`` @xmath125 '' indicates a parameter region in which nearly toroidal configurations exist .",
    "so we find the equilibrium sequences with sly or fps eoss are classified into either rd or md type .",
    "however , the sequences with shen or ls has another type of sequence , in which nearly toroidal configurations @xmath126 exits as in the case of magnetized configurations without rotation ( see section [ smc ] ) .",
    "such a configuration never appears in the model with sly or fps eoss .",
    "looking at the stiffness of eoss in figure  [ adindex ] again , it can be seen that the shen and ls eoss are stiffer than sly and fps eoss near the central density adopted here ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "thus the sequence with a nearly toroidal configuration is found to appear for the stiffer eoss .",
    "this qualitative feature was also noticed in the polytropic studies  @xcite .",
    "then we move on to investigate the structures of the equilibrium configurations .",
    "figures  [ slynew]-[lsnew ] show the distributions of density , and toroidal / poloidal magnetic fields of models characterized by @xmath128 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 for sly , fps , shen , and ls eoss , respectively .",
    "the reason why these values of the parameters are chosen is that we want to fix @xmath75 for the different eos models .",
    "for example , there does not exist the common value of @xmath75 if we set the value of @xmath83 as @xmath129 ( see table  [ real - mag - mix ] ) .",
    "@xmath128 taken here is the smallest common value in the sequences with @xmath118 ( see table  [ real - rot - mix ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the density distributions of stars with sly or fps eoss are more concentrated at the center than those of the stars with shen or ls eoss .",
    "these feature are due to the stiffness of eoss as mentioned above .",
    "we also find the toroidal fields for sly or fps eoss distribute in relatively wider regions in the vicinity of the equatorial plane than for shen or ls eoss , in which the toroidal fields concentrate near the stellar surfaces .",
    "it is noted that the toroidal fields only exist in the interior of the stars , which is due to the choice of the functional form of @xmath53 ( see equation ( [ eq27 ] ) ) .",
    "near the rotational axis , the poloidal magnetic field behaves like a dipole field , where the toroidal fields are weak .",
    "however in the vicinity of the equatorial plane where the toroidal fields become strong , the poloidal fields become distorted .",
    "the region where the magnetic field is mixed depends on the eoss .",
    "the stars with the softer eos ( sly or fps ) tend to have wider mixed region than those with the stiffer eos ( shen or ls ) .",
    "the magnetic field lines @xmath30 may be good a tool to see the structures , showing the tori of twisted field lines around the symmetry axis inside the star and the untwisted poloidal field lines , which penetrate the stellar surface to continue to the vacuum .",
    "it is noted that this universality of the twisted - torus structures of the magnetic fields was seen also in the polytropic stars @xcite . therefore our results for the realistic eoss may be regarded as a further generalization of their results .",

    "<S> , we analyze this tendency in detail . in the general relativistic stars , we find that the difference due to the eoss becomes small because all the employed eoss become sufficiently stiff for the large maximum density , typically greater than @xmath0 . </S>",
