    "they also report that at high frequencies ( above @xmath6  hz ) , the soft excess and continuum are highly variable , but the soft excess is not strongly correlated to the 410  kev emission on these time scales .",

    "we propose now a new model ( fig .",

    "we reiterate that this is not a unique solution , but does explain why there is a strong soft excess , but no soft lag .",
    "as the fe  k lag is interpreted as reverberation between the continuum emission and the blurred emission off a highly ionised accretion disc , we use a relativistic reflection component to fit the fe  k line ( red dotted line ) .",
    "the model is relconv_lp@xmath60reflionx @xcite . while the reflection continuum contributes to the soft excess , it is not the dominant component .",
    "below @xmath92  kev , the spectrum is dominated by a steep power - law component ( green dashed line ) , describing the emission from a jet component that is largely uncorrelated to the emission from small radii .",

    "we find a source height @xmath62 , suggesting that the innermost radii are well illuminated @xcite , and therefore the finding of a small inner radius is robust . in this model the inner radius is assumed to be the inner most stable circular orbit , and therefore the parameters @xmath63 and spin @xmath30 are not independent .",
    "an additional narrow fe  k line does not improve the fit .",
    "the equivalent width of such a line is @xmath64  ev , suggesting that there is little irradiation of cold gas at large radii .",
    "finally , we fit the lag - energy spectrum of fig .",
    "[ totlagen ] with the general relativistic ray - tracing transfer functions from @xcite , similar to the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the profile of the fe  k lag is dependent on the frequency of the fe  k lag , the black hole mass and spin , the inclination of the disc , the height of the source above the corona , and the dilution factor .",
    "the dilution factor is the scaling due to the relative contribution of the variable reflection and variable power - law components in the chosen energy bands .    for a lag at the frequency range specified in fig .",
    "[ totlagen ] , we find for a maximally spinning black hole at a disc inclination , @xmath65 and a point source height , @xmath66 above the disc , the best fit mass is @xmath67 with a dilution factor of 3.5 ( fig .",
    "[ lagen_mo ] ) .",
    "this gives a @xmath68 = 8.41 for 13 degrees of freedom .",
    "we obtain similarly good @xmath68 values for inclinations from @xmath69 . with more data , we will be able to better measure the blue wing of the fe  k lag , which will allow us to better constrain the disc inclination .",
    "the fe  k lag is sensitive to the height of the coronal source , and fits with larger heights give significantly worse results .",
    "we note that the source height is strictly not a free parameter , as we only fit models with source heights of @xmath70 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 40 @xmath71 .",
    "as we can not set a confidence limit on the source height from lag fitting , we can not statistically compare with the height found from spectral fitting , but we note that the two are roughly consistent , and both suggest a small source height .",
    "the fe  k lag fit gives an estimate of a black hole mass of @xmath4 , consistent to previous independent measurements .",
    "the fitted disc inclination and source height are roughly the same as those derived from fitting the mean spectrum in section  [ spec_sec ] .",
    "the dilution factor of 3.5 is high , though it is quite possible given that the power law in the mean energy spectrum likely contributes at frequencies outside of the frequency range of the fe  k lag .",
    "the discovery of the fe  k lag presented here is a strong indication that there is relativistic reflection off a highly ionised accretion disc in this object .",
    "x - ray reverberation gives the scale of the x - ray source and accretion disc in physical units ( e.g. in kilometres rather than gravitational units ) , and so , if we understand the geometry of the system , we can use the amplitude of the lag as an indicator of the black hole mass ( see fig .",
    "12 of * ? ? ?",
    "* , which shows the linear scaling relationship between fe  k lag amplitude and black hole mass for the seven sources with known fe  k lags ) .",
    "we find that for pg  1244 + 026 , the amplitude of the fe  k lag scales with black hole mass , as well , though we note that independent mass estimates can vary by an order of magnitude in this source .",
    "we briefly outline other mass estimates of pg  1244 + 026 , but direct the reader to section  6.3 of @xcite for a more detailed discussion . in that work ,",
    "the mass obtained from fitting the spectral energy distribution is @xmath72 .",
    "optical reverberation measurements put it at a lower black hole mass of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "however , taking into account the effects of radiation pressure increase the mass estimate to @xmath74 @xcite . using the hard x - ray variance and",
    "black hole mass correlation suggests a black hole mass of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "our general relativistic ray - tracing fits find a mass of @xmath76 , which is at the high end of previous estimates , though is entirely consistent .",
    "we note that in most sources , we see a hard lag at low frequencies , which we can not constrain here with the data available .",
    "the hard lag shows a largely featureless lag - energy spectrum ( see fig .",
    "4 in kara et al , 2013c for an example in ark  564 . )",
    "this lag is interpreted as being due to fluctuations in the disc accretion rate .",
    "fluctuations propagate inwards on the viscous timescale , and get transferred up to the corona ( presumably by magnetic fields ) .",
    "this causes the coronal emission at larger radii to respond before the coronal emission at smaller radii @xcite . if the harder emission is produced at the smaller radii ( i.e. because of higher electron temperature closer to the core ) , then the hard emission will lag behind the soft emission produced further out .",
    "it is clear from the lag - energy spectrum in fig .",
    "[ totlagen ] that the lag is not due to the propagation lag because of the sharp drop above 6.5  kev , indicative of a strong broad fe  k reflection feature at these frequencies . furthermore ,",
    "if we were probing a propagation lag that was being diluted by some smaller scale reflection , then the reflection component would have to be nonphysically large to cancel out the large amplitude propagation lag .",
    "this diluting reflection lag would have to be very narrow , and we would expect to see dilution effects at lower energies ( from the red wing of the line ) as well .",
    "all this strongly supports a reverberation interpretation for the lags at these frequencies .",
    "the fe  k lag in pg  1244 + 026 also shows frequency dependence . at lower frequencies , where the timescale of variability indicates a larger emitting region ,",
    "the longest lag is at the line centroid of the fe  k lag .",
    "this is expected as the larger emitting region irradiates larger radii of the accretion disc . at higher frequencies , from a more compact emitting region , the peak of the lag is at @xmath77  kev , the red wing of the line .",
    "the compact emitting region will irradiate the smallest radii , where the gravitational redshift will be greatest .",
    "the amplitude of the lag is smaller , as the light travel time is less .",
    "fe  k lags have been seen in eight seyfert galaxies thus far , and we over - plot four of those in the contours of fig .",
    "[ lagen_stack ] ( as in fig .",
    "11 of * ? ? ?",
    "we over - plot in black points the lag - energy spectrum of pg  1244 + 026 for comparison .",
    "the shape of the fe  k lag is similar , but the soft energy lags have a very different behaviour .",
    "the soft excess does not lag behind the continuum as seen in the other four sources .",
    "the lag - energy spectrum provides us with an additional dimension  time  with which to interpret the mean spectrum .",
    "pg  1244 + 026 has a strong soft excess above the continuum , but , as noted , that soft excess shows no time delay with respect to the continuum .",
    "naively , we expect that if the soft excess was predominantly caused by broadened emission lines from the irradiated accretion disc , then there should be time delays corresponding to the light - travel time from the x - ray source .",
    "pg  1244 + 026 shows a clear broad fe  k lag , a strong signature of relativistic reflection , which is , for some reason , not seen at soft energies .",
    "there are several possibilities for this lack of soft lag .",
    "it could be that the accretion disc in this source has a lower ionisation parameter , which means that most of the photons are not absorbed , and therefore we only see emission from the strongest line , the fe  k line .",
    "another possibility , which we have modelled in fig .",
    "[ spec ] , is that the soft excess is dominated by emission from a jet . in this scenario ,",
    "we see the synchrotron tail of the jet , which we model phenomonologically as a steep power law .",
    "the corona ( or base of the jet ) is responsible for irradiating the accretion disc .",
    "therefore , some of the jetted emission is correlated with the reflected emission , while some of it is correlated only with itself .",
    "this explains the result by @xcite , that the 410  kev band is not strongly correlated with the soft excess at frequencies above @xmath78  hz , where reflection contributes more .",
    "if the majority of the soft excess is caused by emission from the jet , then the majority of the soft excess at this frequency has zero lag with respect to the full reference band .",
    "there is some non - zero lag caused by reflection in the soft excess , but it is diluted by this dominating jetted , zero - lag component .    at high energies , however , where the bulk of the continuum comes from the base of the jet , which has a harder spectrum , the accretion disc is irradiated , and we measure the fe  k lag .",
    "statistically , this model gives a good fit to the time - integrated energy spectrum , and could be possible as this source has some radio emission @xcite .",
    "there is much work to be done in understanding the origin of the soft excess , and we offer this model for pg  1244 + 026 as a possible explanation that is consistent with the spectral - timing results .",
    "we emphasise that all of this work has been done with one orbit of _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "similar analyses in other objects have required much more data ( i.e. 500  ks in ark 564 , 1.3  ms in 1h0707 - 495 ) .",
    "pg  1244 + 026 is a remarkable source with a high count rate , and its clear fe  k lag signature allows us to probe the relativistic effects close to the central black hole .",
    "after submission , we discovered that x - ray time lags in pg  1244 + 026 were simultaneously studied by @xcite . that submitted paper focuses on the lags associated with the soft excess , whereas this paper focuses on the fe  k reverberation lag .",
    "the results in these two papers are consistent , with the only difference being in the choice of reference band . in this paper",
    ", we use a large reference band from 0.310  kev , so as to maximize the signal - to - noise at the fe  k band , whereas in @xcite , they choose the 1.24  kev band , in order to track changes in the soft excess with frequency . the results from these papers show that both relativistic reflection and propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations are important effects in understanding the time lags .",
    "these papers also show the complexities of the soft excess , and the importance of looking at the fe  k band for probing strong gravity ."
