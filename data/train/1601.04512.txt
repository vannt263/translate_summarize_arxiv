    "the @xmath65-function is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) ( note @xmath58 in place of the first argument ) .",
    "if the discrepancy exceeds the preset threshold value , which is set as an external input parameter , the fit is rejected .",
    "central to the scaling of @xmath57 is the pulse height @xmath66 determined directly from the highest point of the baseline - corrected signal ; not from the height of the fitted pulse shape . as opposed to @xmath35 , the discrepancy has the following advantages :    * due to the pulse height @xmath66 replacing the signal baseline rms , the high pulses  which are well discriminated from the baseline  are clearly favored by the lower discrepancy values , while the fits to the lower pulses are more susceptible to rejection . * in case of any systematic difference between the given pulse shape and the pulses in the signal , the terms @xmath67 from eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) scale with the pulse height @xmath66 ; scaling the discrepancy by the same factor compensates for this effect , canceling the negative bias towards the higher pulses .    in addition , adopting the condition expressed through the @xmath68 term helps in rejecting the exaggerated fits to severely saturated pulses , such as the ones caused by an intense @xmath69-flash .",
    "when such pulse is saturated for a longer time than a regular pulse would be , only the steep leading edge of the pulse is fitted , due to the exclusion of the saturated points . by rejecting these fits , a subtraction of the overscaled pulse tails is avoided during the pileup correction procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows an example of the powerful pulse rejection capabilities , based only on the properly set discrepancy threshold .",
    "the single fitted pulse is clearly meaningful , since it significantly deviates from the envelope of the noise .",
    "initially , each of the signal oscillations within a beat is recognized as a potential pulse . since the shape of these false pulses is incompatible with the given pulse shape , the calculated discrepancy is large and the fit is rejected .",
    "the most prominent features of the new pulse shape analysis framework developed for the n_tof - phase3 have been described , including the pulse recognition , the baseline calculation and the pulse shape fitting procedures .",
    "the pulse recognition relies on the calculation of a custom derivative , as a difference between the signal integrals from both sides of a given point .",
    "a supporting procedure for defining the derivative crossing threshold was also described , which isolates the approximate root mean square of the derivative baseline , effectively rejecting the contribution from the beats and actual pulses , while avoiding the dependence on the well defined number of clear presamples .",
    "three different baseline calculation procedures have been adopted .",
    "the simplest one is the constant baseline , which requires a single pass through a signal , without any need for iterative techniques .",
    "one of two adaptive baseline options relies on the weighted averaging of the signal , being appropriate when clear portions of the baseline are indeed at hand .",
    "the second option is appropriate when this condition is not met  due to persistent pileup of pulses , completely concealing the baseline  and no _ a priori _ knowledge about the baseline is available . in this case",
    "the baseline is found as the upper signal envelope , since all regular pulses are treated as negative . in case",
    "some _ a priori _ knowledge of the baseline is available  coming from a consistent detector response to an intense @xmath69-flash  the baseline distortion may be identified in a form of an appropriate pulse shape and may be subtracted from the signal , but only after correcting for the primary baseline offset .",
    "the most basic implementations of previous procedures are of @xmath70 computational complexity , with @xmath12 as the total number of points in a digitized signal waveform and @xmath14 as a characteristic filter width of arbitrary size .",
    "single waveforms recorded by the digital data acquisition system at n_tof may , at present , reach the order of magnitude of @xmath71 points . hence , the @xmath70 complexity constitutes a significant performance issue that had no alternative but to be resolved . therefore , for all such procedures",
    "fast recursive algorithms were implemented , bringing the computational complexity to the @xmath17 , or at least to the approximate @xmath17 level . for the reasons of computational efficiency",
    "the pulse shape fitting routine was also described , though the procedure itself is well established . by the virtue of a complete _ a priori _ knowledge of the pulses ,",
    "the pulse shape fitting procedure allows to subtract the adjusted pulse shapes from the signal , thus correcting for pileup effects and restoring both the energy and timing resolution of the detectors which are considerably affected by pileup .",

    "<S> a pulse shape analysis framework is described , which was developed for n_tof - phase3 , the third phase in the operation of the n_tof facility at cern . </S>",
    "<S> the most notable feature of this new framework is the adoption of generic pulse shape analysis routines , characterized by a minimal number of explicit assumptions about the nature of pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of these routines is to be applicable to a wide variety of detectors , thus facilitating the introduction of the new detectors or types of detectors into the analysis framework . </S>",
    "<S> the operational details of the routines are suited to the specific requirements of particular detectors by adjusting the set of external input parameters . </S>",
    "<S> pulse recognition , baseline calculation and the pulse shape fitting procedure are described . </S>",
    "<S> special emphasis is put on their computational efficiency , since the most basic implementations of these conceptually simple methods are often computationally inefficient .    </S>",
