    "the first indications of qso clustering came from the observations of possible physical pairs of quasars around 1980 ( hazard 1979 , oort 1981 , margon 1981 , webster 1982 ) .",
    "although the individual cases were of tantalizing interest , it was difficult to gain an appreciation of their true significance from a - posteriori statistics .",
    "systematic searches began with the pioneering work of osmer ( 1981 ) and the first detection was obtained by shaver ( 1984 ) , using a large , inhomogeneous qso catalog .",
    "the surveys carried out to investigate the qso luminosity function ( lf ) before long provided statistically - well - defined samples with sufficient surface density and size for a study of the clustering on scales of a few tens of mpc ( shanks 1983 , 1987 ) .",
    "the two - point correlation function ( tpcf ) and its fourier transform , the power - spectrum , have been applied as a standard approach to investigate the qso clustering , but other techniques have also been explored , such as counts in cells ( andreani 1994 , carrera 1998 ) , the minimal spanning tree ( graham 1995 ) , fractal analysis ( andreani 1991 ) and the friend - of - friend algorithm ( komberg 1996 ) .",
    "notwithstanding all the caveats due to their exotic nature , qsos display a number of appealing properties when compared to galaxies as cosmological probes of the intermediate - linear regime of clustering , on distances @xmath5 mpc : they show a rather flat redshift distribution , make it possible to define samples which are in practice locally volume limited , their point - like images are less prone to the surface - brightness biases typical of galaxies and they sparse - sample the environment .    in recent times complete samples totaling about 2000 qsos have been assembled , providing a @xmath6 detection of the qso clustering on scales of the order of @xmath7 comoving mpc ( andreani & cristiani 1992 , mo & fang 1993 , croom & shanks 1996 ) , an amplitude which appears to be consistent with or slightly larger than what is observed for present - day galaxies and definitely lower than the clustering of clusters .",
    "the evolution of the qso clustering with redshift is still a matter of debate .",
    "an amplitude constant in comoving coordinates or marginally decreasing with increasing redshift has been the standard claim till recently .",
    "however , a number of indications currently point the opposite direction .",
    "the data of the palomar transit grism survey ( kundi 1997 , stephens 1997 ) make it possible to measure the amplitude of the tpcf at redshifts higher than 2.7 and the result , @xmath8 mpc , is suggestively higher than what is observed at lower redshifts .",
    "la franca ( 1998 ) have observed a sample of 388 qsos with @xmath9 and @xmath10 over a _ connected _ area of 25 square degrees in the south galactic pole ( sgp ) .",
    "the tpcf analysis gives an amplitude @xmath11 mpc , in agreement with previous results .",
    "but when the evolution of the clustering with redshift is analyzed , evidence is found for an _ increase _ of the clustering with increasing z , although only at a @xmath12 level .",
    "boyle & mo ( 1993 ) measured the clustering of low - z qsos in the emss and georgantopoulos & shanks ( 1994 ) used the iras point source catalog to measure the clustering of seyferts . altogether a low value of the average tpcf within 15 mpc and z=0.05 is obtained , @xmath13 .    on the other hand , carrera ( 1998 ) , on the basis of 235 x - ray selected agns from the rixos and drs surveys , do not support an increase of the clustering amplitude with redshift .",
    "it is also worth noting that the clustering measured by carrera ( 1998 ) for these x - ray selected objects , @xmath14 ( with the non - crucial assumption of stable evolution ) , is significantly smaller than what is observed for optically - uv - selected qsos .",
    "this opens the interesting possibility of having a contribution of agns to the xrb larger than the standardly quoted 50% , without violating the limits imposed by the angular auto - correlation - function ( carrera & barcons 1992 , carrera 1993 , georgantopoulos 1993 , danese 1993 , chen 1994 , sotan & hasinger 1994 ) .",
    "the customary appeal `` more data are needed '' arises naturally in this context : hidden correlations , for example with the absolute luminosity , as observed for galaxies ( park 1994 ) , although undetected or undetectable in the present data , might confuse our perspective on the issue of clustering evolution .",
    "hopefully we will not wait long , thanks to the 2df qso redshift survey ( cf .",
    "croom , these proceedings ) .    at the moment , if we limit the analysis to the optical data and parameterize the evolving correlation function in a standard way : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an arbitrary ( and not very physical ) fitting parameter , we obtain @xmath17 , which appears inconsistent with the @xmath18 observed for faint galaxies at lower redshifts ( le fvre 1996 , carlberg 1997 , villumsen 1997 , postman 1998 ) .",
    "great care should be exercised however when carrying out this comparison .",
    "quasars could be more significantly related to the population of lyman - break galaxies , which show substantial clustering at @xmath19 ( steidel 1998 ) and can be interpreted as progenitors of massive galaxies at the present epoch or precursors of present day cluster galaxies ( governato 1998 ) .    as mentioned",
    ", the standard parameterization of the clustering may not be a sensible description .",
    "the observed clustering is the result of an interplay between the clustering of mass , decreasing with increasing redshift , and the bias , increasing with redshift , convolved with the redshift distribution of the objects ( moscardini 1998 , bagla 1998 ) and obviously is critically linked to the physics of qso formation and evolution .",
    "let us consider here as an archetypical scenario the one outlined by cavaliere ( 1997 ) , modeling the _ rise and fall _ of the qso lf as the effect of two components : the newly formed black holes , which are dominant at @xmath20 and the reactivated black holes , which dominate at @xmath21 .",
    "the reactivation is triggered by interactions taking place preferentially in groups of galaxies of typical halo mass @xmath22 m@xmath23 .    in this way",
    "the clustering properties of qsos are related to those of transient , short - lived , objects ( matarrese 1997 ) .",
    "this is markedly different from the situation with respect to galaxies , which in turn can be associated with a merging or object - conserving paradigm of long - lived objects . at high redshifts qsos",
    "correspond to larger ( rarer ) mass over - densities collapsing early and cluster very strongly .",
    "then the clustering amplitude decreases till the mass scale typical of a qso reaches the value of the average collapsing peaks , after which clustering may grow again .",
    "if we think of qsos as objects sparsely sampling halos with @xmath24 , an @xmath25 would provide the desired amount _ and _ evolution of the clustering .",
    "the ideas presented in the previous section are corroborated by the study of qso environments . over the years , starting with the pioneering observations of stockton ( 1978 , 1982 ) , evidence has been accumulating that qsos are associated with enhancements in the galaxy distribution . at low redshifts ( @xmath26 )",
    "quasars reside in small to moderate groups of galaxies , rather than in rich clusters ( yee & green 1984 , haymann 1990 , smith & heckman 1990 ) .",
    "the qso / galaxy correlation function has been measured to be @xmath27 times stronger than the galaxy / galaxy correlation function ( fisher et al .",
    "1996 ) . at higher redshifts ,",
    "there is a marked difference in the environments of radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos ( yee & green 1987 , yee & ellingson 1993 ) .",
    "radio - loud qsos are often found in association with rich clusters ( abell richness @xmath28 ) , at least on scales larger than @xmath29 ( hall & green 1998 ) , while radio - quiet quasars appear to remain in smaller groups .",
    "an indirect confirmation comes from the observations of close line - of - sight ( los ) qso pairs . in their absorption spectra lines",
    "are often seen in the spectrum of the more distant qso at a redshift corresponding to that of the foreground qso - the so - called _ associated absorption _ - showing that qsos are located in higher - than - average galaxy density regions ( shaver & robertson 1983 , phillips 1986 , cristiani & shaver 1988 ) .",
    "the study of the qso clustering on scales larger than a few tens of mpc is a much less beaten path . on the one hand",
    "the familiar tpcf is known to be inefficient for detecting structures on scales comparable with the dimension of the sample ( e.g. pando & fang 1996 ) and other approaches , such as the wavelet analysis or counts - in - cells , may represent better tools . on the other hand observational biases",
    "may be extremely dangerous in this situation : for example modulations of the sensitivity on scales of the order of the size of a schmidt plate may introduce spurious power on scales of the order of 100 mpc . in the present absence of proper systematic surveys on these large scales",
    "one should therefore take with the classical grain of salt the several examples of qso super - structures , derived mostly from inhomogeneous catalogues , being aware of the pitfalls of a - posteriori statistics .",
    "for the large scales we are in many respects in a situation similar to that of the early eighties for the small scales .",
    "nonetheless there are at least two known cases which appear as outstanding examples of large quasar groups :    1 .",
    "a group of 23 quasars within @xmath30 at @xmath31 , found by crampton , cowley & hartwick ( 1989 ) 2 .",
    "a group of 14 quasars within @xmath32 at @xmath33 , found by komberg in the sgp . in the sgp , thanks to the large number of deep surveys carried out by various authors , at least a couple of other possible super - structures , although of less compelling evidence , have been identified ( clowes and campusano 1991 , graham 1995 ) .",
    "such large groups appear as possible progenitors of the present - epoch great attractors ( i.e. regions in the local universe with over - densities @xmath34 on scales @xmath35 ) : and their spatial comoving density can be estimated to be comparable to local super - clusters . pinpointing the qso clustering on these large scales would immediately provide another challenge to cosmological models , but for this a systematization of the field is needed .",
    "great advances are expected from the wide - field facilities which have come recently into operation : sdss , the 2df qso survey and also from large - area follow - up spectroscopy of radio surveys like first .",
    "inspired by the paradigm unifying radio - loud qsos and frii radio - sources it is interesting to check whether the observations of radio - galaxies measure clustering properties consistent with those of qsos .    historically , the long debate on the spatial distribution of radio galaxies led to the widely - accepted view that radio sources were isotropically distributed , at least on large scales ( webster 1976 ) . + the problem with radio surveys is that in general they lack the redshift information and the clustering analysis has to resort to the angular correlation function .",
    "the large range in intrinsic luminosity of radio sources leads then to a wide convolution that dilutes dramatically any clustering signal .",
    "in fact , when the studies of the radio sources have been limited to nearby objects as seldner & peebles ( 1981 ) did for 4c sources at @xmath36 or shaver & pierre ( 1989 ) for molonglo sources at @xmath37 , structures were found , including the super - galactic plane .",
    "peacock & nicholson in 1991 used an all - sky sample of radio - galaxies at @xmath36 to measure their 3d tpcf , @xmath38mpc . in recent times kooiman ( 1995 ) and loan , wall & lahav ( 1997 ) analyzed the 4.85 ghz green bank and the parkes - mit - nrao surveys with the tpcf , showing that radio objects appear to be more strongly clustered than local optically - selected galaxies .",
    "+ magliocchetti ( this conference ) reports on the studies carried out on the first database ( magliocchetti 1998a , b , cress et al 1996,1998 ) , which provide indeed an estimate of the correlation amplitude , @xmath39mpc , for objects typically at @xmath40 , consistent with the qso result . to gain more robust insight",
    "it is however mandatory to obtain redshifts and radio morphologies at least for a training subsample of these databases in order to remove the basic statistical uncertainties concerning the redshift distribution and the multi - component nature of many sources .",
    "the environments of radio - galaxies at redshifts @xmath41 also appear to be remarkably similar to those of qsos , that is _ on average _ not richer than abell class 0 clusters ( roche 1998 ) , with a correlation function significantly stronger ( @xmath42mpc ) and steeper ( @xmath43 ) than what is observed for `` normal '' galaxies , but consistent with the estimates for local early - type galaxies of guzzo ( 1997 ) .",
    "a complementary view of the lss is provided by the study of qso absorption spectra , which sensitively probe , in a luminosity unbiased way , the spatial distribution of baryons in the universe .",
    "historically , the so - called sharp metal - lines have been the first class of absorbers recognized to cluster significantly .",
    "already in 1982 young , sargent & boksenberg indicated that the peak observed in the tpcf of civ doublets could be due to galaxy - galaxy clustering at @xmath1 rather than to multiple clouds in individual galaxies .",
    "this was reiterated in 1988 by sargent , steidel & boksenberg on the basis of a sample of 55 qsos observed at @xmath44 km / s resolution , measuring a correlation function @xmath45 for los velocity differences @xmath46 km / s . in recent times",
    "petitjean & bergeron ( 1994 ) , songaila & cowie ( 1996 ) and dodorico ( 1998a ) , using higher - resolution , smaller samples , have measured a @xmath47 at @xmath48 km / s .",
    "quashnock & vanden berk ( 1998 ) have used a compilation of heavy - element qso absorbers to estimate the civ tpcf from 200 up to about 3000 km / s .",
    "the various authors unanimously remark that on small scales the velocity structure must to a certain extent reflect relative motions of clouds within individual halos , a circumstance confirmed by the relative weakness of the correlation observed in the transverse direction on the adjacent lines - of - sight of a qso triplet ( crotts 1997 ) .",
    "however , we can see from fig .",
    "2 that , taken at face value , the results by dodorico on small scales and by quashnock & vanden berk together define with remarkable accuracy a civ cf at @xmath49 of the canonical power - law form , with an @xmath50 mpc and @xmath51 . + an evolution of the cf as a function of @xmath52 is also detected and can be described in the standard parameterization of  1 by an @xmath53 .",
    "this evolutionary pattern is apparently followed also by the mgii systems , which , as shown by petitjean & bergeron ( 1990 , 1994 ) and caulet ( 1989 ) , in spite of the different ionization phase are similar to civ systems in terms of cross sections .",
    "there is also evidence for a dependence ( increase ) of the clustering strength on the ( increasing ) column density of the systems ( dodorico 1998a , quashnock & vanden berk 1998 ) , which suggests , together with the large correlation scale found , that the civ absorbers are biased tracers of relatively high density regions .",
    "it also cautions us that the agreement with the standard @xmath54 power - law behavior of the cf shown in fig.2 may be `` too - good - to - be - true '' , since the lines of the sample by dodorico et al .",
    "have on average lower @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) than the ones in the quashnock & vanden berk sample ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "again , plenty of data are needed to disentangle the various dependences , including the evolutionary rates as a function of the column density .",
    "the search for clustering of the lyman-@xmath58 lines has produced disparate results over the years .",
    "systematic studies of the redshift distribution in the qso lyman-@xmath58 forest began in the early 80 s with the work by sargent ( 1980 ) who concluded that no structures could be identified .",
    "almost all the subsequent results have failed to detect any significant correlation on velocity scales @xmath59 km s@xmath60 ( sargent 1982 , webb & barcons 1991 ) . on smaller scales",
    "( @xmath61 km s@xmath60 ) there have been indications of weak clustering ( webb 1987 , crotts 1989 , rauch 1992 , chernomordik 1995 , cristiani 1995 , kim 1997 ) together with relevant non - detections ( pettini 1990 , stangler & webb 1993 , kirkman & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "the absence of power in the tpcf has been claimed as a striking characteristic of the lyman-@xmath58 forest and has been used , together with the observed low metallicity , as a basic argument to develop a scenario of the lyman-@xmath58 absorbers as a totally distinct population with respect to metal systems and therefore galaxies .    in recent times a large database of high - resolution ( @xmath62 km / s ) , high - s / n spectra of the lyman forest has become available , allowing a detailed investigation , especially at high redshift , where the density of lines provides particular sensitivity .",
    "cristiani ( 1997 ) have used more than 1600 lines to detect a weak but significant signal , with @xmath63 on scales of 100 km s@xmath60 at a @xmath64 level .    exploring the variations of the clustering as a function of the column density no evidence for clustering",
    "is found for lines with @xmath65 . on the contrary , for lines with @xmath66 , the correlation function at @xmath67 km s@xmath60 shows a remarkable increase in amplitude ( @xmath68 ) and significance ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "no relevant feature other than the peak at small velocity separations is observed .",
    "in particular previous claims for anti - clustering on scales @xmath70 km s@xmath60 are not confirmed .",
    "[ figclustew ] shows more in detail the variation of the amplitude of the tpcf as a function of the column density .",
    "a trend of increasing amplitude with increasing column density is apparent all the way up to the two points in the upper right that represent the clustering of metal systems .",
    "the tricky part in the otherwise trivial computation of the tpcf in the velocity space @xmath71 is the correct estimation of @xmath72 , the number of pairs expected in a given velocity bin from a random distribution in redshift .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the particular cosmological evolution ( @xmath73 ) adopted , but the effects of the intrinsic blending , line blanketing of weak lines due to strong complexes and finite spectral resolution have to be carefully reproduced .",
    "fernndez - soto ( 1996 ) have investigated the clustering properties of the lyman-@xmath58 clouds on the basis of the corresponding civ absorptions .",
    "they measure in this way a strong clustering for lines with @xmath74 @xmath75 , suggesting that civ may resolve better the small - scale velocity structure .",
    "a caveat however has to be filed , about the different behavior of high and low - ionization species and in general of and metal systems ( see also below the observations of qso gravitational lenses ,  3.3 )",
    ".    of course , rather than just correlating lines regardless of their properties , increasingly more refined approaches are possible : from the correlation of ew or @xmath76 weighting ( webb & barcons 1991 , zuo 1992 ) , to the correlation of optical depths or pixel intensities ( press 1993 , cen 1998 ) , to the full recovery of the density field ( haehnelt & nusser , this conference ) and much is being learnt from simulations ( weinberg , this conference ) .",
    "the study of the evolution of the tpcf with the redshift in the optical range ( @xmath77 ) suggests that for lyman-@xmath58 lines with column densities @xmath78 the amplitude of the correlation at @xmath44 km s@xmath60 decreases with increasing redshift ( cristiani 1997 ) .",
    "unfortunately , hst data are still at too low - resolution or are too scanty ( bahcall 1996 , brandt 1995 ) to allow a meaningful comparison . nonetheless , the result by ulmer ( 1996 ) , who measured with fos data a @xmath79 , on scales of @xmath80 km / s at @xmath81 , suggests that the trend persists at lower redshifts .    if we add to this observation the following pieces of evidence :    1 .   at low redshift a significant fraction of the lyman-@xmath58 lines has been observed to be associated with luminous galaxies and the local large - scale structure ( le brun 1996 , chen 1998 ,  4 ) ; 2 .",
    "metallicities of the order @xmath82 , i.e. similar to the ones derived for the heavy - element absorptions originated in galactic halos , are observed for lyman-@xmath58 clouds with @xmath83 ( cowie 1995 , songaila & cowie 1996 ) ; 3 .",
    "the volume density and cosmological evolution of the same @xmath84 clouds are similar to those of the damped systems ( giallongo 1996 ) ;    all together this suggests a physical association between the lyman-@xmath58 clouds with @xmath83 and the halos of protogalactic systems .",
    "the typical column density above which the clustering is observed ( @xmath85 ) corresponds to the position of the break in their column density distribution ( petitjean 1993 , giallongo 1996 ) and we should not be surprised that below that no clustering is observed since the weaker lines are recognized to probe under - dense regions of the universe .      on large scales observations show the existence of significant over- and under - densities of lines on scales of a few tens of mpc .",
    "a typical case is the occurrence of the so - called voids for which a few interesting claims exist : crotts ( 1987 , 1989 ) was the first to suggest the presence of a @xmath86 gap of absorption lines in the lyman forest of the qso 0420 - 388 , dobrzycki & bechtold ( 1991a , 1991b ) found a void of @xmath87 in q0302 - 003 and cristiani ( 1995 , 1997 ) two of about @xmath88 in q0055 - 269 .",
    "the systematical analysis of the same sample of lines described in the previous subsection corroborates the idea that voids of a few tens of mpc occur occasionally in qso absorption spectra : the filling factor is low , a few percent of the available los path - length .",
    "regions corresponding to the voids are not completely devoid of lines : weak absorptions are observed within the voids .",
    "this agrees with low - redshift observations ( shull 1996 ) showing that in the local universe voids are not entirely devoid of matter .    over densities on scales",
    "again of a few tens of mpc ( never more than that ) have been found at @xmath89 , roughly with the same frequency observed for under - densities .",
    "the most remarkable ones remain q0237 - 233 ( sargent 1988 , heisler , hogan & white 1989 ) and the pair 1037/1038 - 27 ( jakobsen 1986 , 1988 , cristiani 1987 , sargent & steidel 1987 , lespine & petitjean 1997 ) , which display clumps of metal - lines on scales of the order of 10000 km / s .",
    "francis & hewett found an interesting coincidence ( within 300 km / s ) of two pairs damped systems at z=2.38 and 2.85 in the spectra of two qsos whose los are separated by @xmath90 .",
    "great care should be exercised before interpreting these structures in terms of gravitational instabilities since other phenomena , also of great interest , may be acting : proximity effects , i.e. excess ionization caused by a nearby qso , and any ionization inhomogeneity in the uv background which becomes more and more important with increasing redshift ( haardt and madau 1996 , reimers 1998 ) .",
    "an unfortunate shortcoming of clustering studies based on absorption lines is the 2-d nature of the information , typically confined to the analysis along the los .",
    "pairs and groups of qsos offer an invaluable insight in this respect and the advent of 8-m class telescopes will certainly boost the field , allowing a systematic detailed 3-d mapping of absorbers and galaxies at the same time up to the highest redshifts .",
    "historically , quasar pairs have provided information about _ a ) _ the size of the absorbers , which turned out to be much larger than the few tens of kpc scale thought a decade ago , _",
    "b ) _ the existence of superclusters at high redshift ( see  3.3 ) , _ c ) _ the association of qsos with moderate overdensities (  1.3 ) .    where do we stand now ?",
    "on small scales ( @xmath91 kpc ) gravitational lenses have shown that the forest of lines in the spectra of the two images of a lens can be amazingly similar with differences less than a few percent on scales of a few hundred pc ( rauch , this conference ) .",
    "this is very important because it tells us that in the case of - not metal lines - the medium is quite homogeneous on such scales and therefore an empirical limit is provided for the critical issue of the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations ( cf .",
    "theuns , this conference ) .    at the intermediate ( @xmath92 ) scales progress",
    "has been slow in the last decade , due to the scarcity of suitably bright pairs and groups for 4m - class telescopes .",
    "dodorico ( 1998b ) have recently re - observed the qso pair 0307 - 195 and re - discussed this and the other 7 pairs in the literature with data of comparable quality .",
    "a typical size of the absorbers - with the assumption of spherical geometry - of @xmath93 kpc is inferred ( fig.4 ) . besides , remarkably quiet velocity fields are observed with differences between coincident lines within 100 km / s ( dinshaw 1994 ) .",
    "the present data are not sufficient to support a correlation of the typical inferred size with the proper separation or with the redshift of the pairs , which was claimed in the past .",
    "it may be argued then whether such dimensions can really be considered cloud radii or are rather correlation lengths , a distinction which tends to be blurred in view of the present hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "it is also debatable whether flattened disk - like geometries tend to be favored ( dinshaw 1997 ) , or spherical clouds with an @xmath94 column density profile and a power - law distribution of radii can give a satisfactory representation of the observations , too . certainly the empirical evidence points to large ionization fractions and consequently large masses .",
    "on the basis of the inferred sizes and the uv background measured at @xmath95 by giallongo ( 1996 ) the optically thin absorbers probed in qso pairs are expected to have a neutral fraction @xmath96 and their contribution to the mean intergalactic density is close to conflict with the baryon limit from nucleosynthesis .    on the large scales , after the studies of tol1037/1038 , there has been disappointingly little progress .",
    "the most remarkable recent result has been produced by williger ( 1996 ) who observed metal systems in 25 los spanning @xmath97 , spread over about 1 sq .",
    "degree in the south galactic pole . in spite of the praiseworthy effort ,",
    "the final sample of civ systems collected by williger makes it possible to compute the tpcf by cross - correlating a maximum of 22 absorbers and is just sufficient to reject the null hypothesis of a random distribution .",
    "the reason is again the same : the surface density of qsos accessible to 4-m telescopes for this type of work is simply too small .",
    "future prospects , however , look really exciting . starting at the end of 1999 , the echelle spectrograph uves will be available on the ut2 of vlt , extending , with respect to hires at keck , the possibility of high - resolution ( @xmath98 ) observations down to at least @xmath99 and to a shorter wavelength range ( i.e. to more numerous , lower - redshift qsos ) .",
    "then ( by 2001 ) the flames facility ( see http://http.hq.eso.org/instrumen + ts / flames/ ) will allow observation with uves of up to 8 qsos at the same time in a field of 25 arcmin diameter and/or 130 targets in the same area with an intermediate / high resolution spectrograph , giraffe .",
    "this opens up enormous possibilities : for example the alcock - paczinsky test applied to qso groups to investigate the cosmological geometry ( hui , this conference ) would require few observing nights .",
    "this test , based on the comparison between the clustering properties of the ( ) absorbers , namely the tpcf , observed along the los and the corresponding estimate in the transverse direction , is especially sensitive to @xmath100 and should be able to discriminate between an ( @xmath101 ) and an ( @xmath102 ) universe at a @xmath103 level by observing @xmath104 qso pairs ( hui 1998 ) .",
    "at lower redshift , after the pioneering work on the identification of galaxies giving origin to metal absorbers ( bergeron & boiss 1991 , bergeron 1992 ) , the more recent activity on systems , triggered by the hst observations , is fueling a lively debate . a number of authors ( morris 1993 , lanzetta 1995 , le brun , bergeron & boiss 1996 , van gorkom 1996 , chen 1998 , weymann et al .",
    "1998 ) have argued whether the low - redshift absorption systems have a direct physical connection with galaxies or a significant fraction of them is caused by a truly intergalactic medium .",
    "a central point in this debate is the anti - correlation between the equivalent width and the impact parameter of the los from the center of the galaxies measured by some authors ( lanzetta 1995 , cen 1998 ) and not fully confirmed by others ( le brun 1996 , bowen 1996 ) .    at the moment it appears possible to reconcile the various observations _",
    "if _ the presence of well defined galactic envelopes is invoked only for the relatively strong absorption lines .",
    "the covering factor around each galaxy for this class of absorbers is high at impact parameters @xmath105 kpc , dropping rapidly at larger separations",
    ". the weaker lines , which also display a significantly slower redshift evolution ( weymann 1998 ) , occur then in filaments up to several mpc away from the nearest galaxy .",
    "the zoo of interpretations for the low - z ly@xmath58 systems includes : tidal tails ( morris & van den berg 1994 ) , galactic winds ( wang 1995 ) , outer parts of disk and irregular galaxies ( maloney 1992 ) , clouds that are pressure confined by a hotter gas in extended galactic halos ( mo 1994 ) , extended low redshift disk galaxies which , in a short burst of star formation , blow out their denser centers and disappear from view , while their gas cross - section remains ( the `` cheshire cat model '' : salpeter 1993 ) , galaxy clusters ( lanzetta et al 1996 ) .",
    "possibly , more than one population will have to be invoked in order to fully account for all the observations .",
