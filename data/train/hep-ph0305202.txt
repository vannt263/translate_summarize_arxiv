    "the baryogenesis is a very important subject in particle physics and cosmology . in most of the baryogenesis scenarios including those of leptogenesis ,",

    "then , for @xmath256 the ad - flatons @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 together move gradually toward the minimum @xmath177 due to the effect of the negative thermal - log term .    if the hubble parameter decreases further to @xmath257 , the mass term @xmath258 dominates over the quartic terms @xmath254 and @xmath55 @xmath259 to link @xmath9 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "then , @xmath9 begins to oscillate toward the origin with redshift faster as @xmath0 rather than @xmath260 , so that the ad - flatons turn to move from the minimum @xmath177 to the minimum @xmath172 with @xmath261 .",
    "since the negative thermal - log term dominates much earlier than the mass terms with @xmath142 , the ad - flatons do not get significant angular momenta until @xmath257 .",

    "this would imply that @xmath9 is not liberated fully from @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the presence of the @xmath173 term and the phase - dependent quartic terms @xmath254 and @xmath55 .    particularly due to this complicated behavior of @xmath9 linked to @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the case of @xmath249 ,",
    "the lepton number asymmetry @xmath195 oscillates violently for @xmath264 .",
    "its mean maginitude , on the other hand , tends to be saturated to some large value @xmath265 for @xmath266 after the epoch of transition from @xmath177 to @xmath172 , as seen by numerical calculations . after the reheating ,",
    "the plasma temperature @xmath155 decreases faster as @xmath267 rather than @xmath268 , so that @xmath7 and @xmath8 trapped by the minimum @xmath172 also decrease faster as @xmath269 .",
    "then , by considering the rate equation it would be expected that the lepton number asymmetry is fixed , providing a significant amount of @xmath2 in eq .",

    "in summary , we have investigated the leptogenesis with the supersymmetric higgs triplets in the light of experimental verification in the tev region .",
    "the lepton number asymmetry really appears after the inflation via multiscalar coherent evolution of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 on the flat manifold .",
    "if the higgs triplet mass terms dominate over the negative thermal - log term for @xmath144 , the asymmetry is fixed readily to some significant value by the redshift and rotation of the ad - flatons , providing the sufficient lepton - to - entroy ratio @xmath2",

    "on the other hand , if the negative thermal - log term dominates first , the evolution of the ad - flatons appears different substantially . even in this case",
