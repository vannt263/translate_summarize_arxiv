    "the values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 have already been obtained from the neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite , so that the rest four unknown neutrino parameters are the three cp phases , @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath37 , and the lightest neutrino mass , @xmath5 .",
    "note that only the absolute value @xmath38 has been acquired , which leaves us two possible orderings : the normal ordering for @xmath39 with @xmath40 , and the inverted one for @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath16 can have some special approximate texture - zero forms when it is generated by some high dimensional lnv operators .",
    "for example , if @xmath43 gives the leading contribution to neutrino masses , then @xmath44 should be approximately proportional to the sum of charged lepton masses , @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
