    "k - shell spectra ( generally refers to the helium - like ) shows a powerful diagnostic potential for the electron density . since the work of @xcite , which defines a ratio between the _ forbidden @xmath9 _ line ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) and the _ intercombination lines @xmath12 _ line ( @xmath13@xmath11 ) , many literatures reported the ratio by consideration of effects of radiation field  @xcite , dielectronic and radiative recombinations  @xcite .",

    ", the ratio of helium - like spectra has been extensively adopted to derived the electron density and further estimations of the stellar structure and the heating mechanism in x - ray emitting regions  @xcite . moreover , spatial information of coronae could be assessed indirectly using correlation ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 refers to an emission measure ) between the electron density and the emission measure .",
    "besides the k - shell emission lines , many l - shell emission lines from highly charged oxygen , neon , silicon , sulphur , calcium , iron and nickel ions have been detected in stellar coronal spectra .",
    "for inactive stars , m - shell transition lines were also identified  @xcite .",
    "the diagnostic potential of the l - shell emission lines has been investigated by many authors , such as the ratio @xmath16(50.524)/@xmath16(50.691 ) of si  x , @xmath16(52.306)/@xmath16(43.743 ) , @xmath16(52.306)/@xmath16(46.391 ) of si  xi addressed in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "similar characteristics were explored for si  viii , s  x , ar  xiv and ca xvi etc .",
    "@xcite .    for boron - like extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) spectra from transitions of @xmath172 , @xcite studied density - sensitive line ratios of si  x and ar  xiv by using accurate excitation data from @xmath18matrix method . for @xmath0 transition lines spanned in the soft x - ray region ,",
    "line intensity ratios of highly charged silicon ions were investigated in our previous work  @xcite , which shows a @xmath8-sensitivity in the range of @xmath19  @xmath2 . by laboratory measurements in the electron beam ion trap ( ebit ) , @xcite test the density - sensitive line ratios of ar  xiv and fe  xxii in ranges of @xmath20  @xmath2 and low - density limit around 1.0@xmath21  @xmath2 , respectively . in that work ,",
    "the actual electron density was constrained from k - shell n vi spectrum .",

    "we make a systematically analyses for the @xmath0 density - sensitive transition lines of boron - like spectra including si  x , s  xii , ar  xiv and fe  xxii based on the collisional - radiative model as given in sec .  2 .",
    "in sec .  3 , we explore the @xmath0 transition lines of s  xii at 36.398 and 36.564   in the stellar coronal spectra observed by the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) spectrometer on board the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. furthermore , the electron densities of stellar corona and laboratory plasmas produced in the ebit are estimated as illustrated in sec .  4 , followed by conclusions outlined in sec .  5",
    "the line intensity ratio between the @xmath24@xmath25 transition and the @xmath26@xmath27 transition lines are known to be sensitive to the electron density but on the other hand rather insensitive to the electron temperature .",
    "this feature follows from the fact that the upper level is populated mainly by collisional excitation from the density - sensitive lower metastable level . in the following paragraph",
    ", we take s  xii to explain this property .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ leveldiagram ] , the levels of the configuration @xmath28 have the largest excitation rate from the levels of the ground configuration , whereas the decaying lines span in the euv wavelength region . here",
    "we pay special attention on the x - ray emission lines .",
    "the @xmath24 level has a high excitation rate from and decay rate to the metastable @xmath25 level , which is forbidden to decay to the ground state . by increasing the electron density ,",
    "a significant fraction of the @xmath29 population can be re - excited to the @xmath30 state , from where it relaxes to the @xmath29 state and , therefore , the line intensity at 36.564   increases . on the other hand , by the depopulation of the ground state @xmath31 due to the shelving of electrons in the metastable level , the excitation of the resonance line ( @xmath26@xmath27 ) at 36.398   of s  xii decreases at high densities .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath32 level can also decay to the metastable @xmath29 level with a low branching ratio .",
    "however , as this tranistion line ( at 36.573   for s  xii ) can not be resolved from the 36.564   line due to the limited spectral resolution in the present space missions , we have to take into account this blend effect .",
    "since the @xmath26 is directly populated from the ground state , the intensity of 36.573   has a similar dependence on @xmath8 as the 36.398   resonance line and it relative contribution to the blended 36.564   line becomes dominant at low electron density .      adopting a collisional - radiative model , we calculated the line ratio [ _ i_(@xmath33)+_i_(@xmath34)]/_i_(@xmath35 ) of si  x , s  xii , ar  xiv and fe  xxii , as a function of the electron density for a maxwellian electron distribution at temperatures of peak fraction of these ions in the work of  @xcite .",
    "the transition wavelengths are listed in table  [ wavelength ] . for si  x and ar  xiv ,",
    "the atomic data including energy levels , radiative decay rates and impact excitation rates are from our detailed calculation .",
    "some excitation data within @xmath36 transitions are replaced by more accurate calculation with @xmath18matrix method as explained in previous literatures  @xcite . for s",

    "the atomic data is updated recently as depicted by  @xcite . for s xii , the electron impact excitation data of  @xcite has been adopted , in which small errors found by later have been corrected by authors in the present version of the chianti .",
    "resonance effects for excitations among the lowest 15 fine - structure levels have been included by the _",
    "r_-matrix method . for fe xxii ,",
    "the electron excitation data between the lowest 204 levels are from the work of  @xcite who adopted close - coupling _ r_-matrix method and in conjunction with intermediate - coupling frame transformation method .",
    "the electron excitation data between higher 205 - 513 levels adopts the calculation of  @xcite , in which the resonance effects were considered by an isolated - resonance approximation . above the ionization energy ,",
    "the calculation of  @xcite with the breit - pauli _ r_-matrix method was used .",
    "additionally , proton excitations between the fine - structure states of the ground configuration and @xmath37 term were also included  @xcite in the chianti . in this work",

    "this demonstrates that the ratio is sensitive to the electron density in ranges @xmath19  @xmath2 , @xmath3  @xmath2 , @xmath4  @xmath2 and @xmath5  @xmath2 for si  x , s  xii , ar  xiv and fe  xxii , respectively .",

    "the properties of our sample , along with obsid and exposure time are summarized in table  [ stars ] .",

    "however only one observation is available from _ chandra data archival center _ for our sample .",
    "another goal of analysis for the acis - s spectrum of capella is to validate whether there is significant contamination from high - order ( refer to @xmath41 ) spectra around the selected lines ( 36.398 and 36.564   ) .",
    "if line fluxes derived from the two different observations are comparable , no contamination from high - order spectra can be concluded .",

    "[ acisspectra ] .",
    "it is clear that the line - width in hrc - s observation is wider than acis - s observation , which is due to its lower resolution .",
    "additionally , for the line at 36.398   , the derived line flux from hrc - s observation is higher than the value from acis - s observation by a factor of @xmath432.8 ( see table  [ lineflux ] ) .",
    "this is due to the contamination from third - order diffraction of emission line at @xmath4312.136   with flux of 11.04@xmath44  photons  @xmath45s@xmath46 ( see 7-th column in table  [ lineflux ] ) , resulting from ne  x ly@xmath39 ( 12.134   ) and fe  xvii ( 12.124   ) .",
