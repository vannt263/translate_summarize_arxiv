    "in august 2004 for the first time using the cosy11  @xcite facility we have conducted a measurement of the @xmath2 meson production in the proton - neutron collision  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the experiment is the determination of the total cross section of the @xmath3 reaction near the kinematical threshold .",
    "we expect that the comparison of the @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath5 total cross sections will help to understand the production of the @xmath2 meson in different isospin channels and to investigate aspects of the gluonium component of this meson . in the framework of the quark model",
    "the @xmath0 meson is predominantly a flavour - singlet combination of quark - antiquark pairs , and it is expected to mix with purely gluonic states .",
    "therefore , additionally to the production mechanisms associated with meson exchange  @xcite it is also possible that the @xmath0 meson is produced from excited glue in the interaction region of the colliding nucleons , which couple to the @xmath0 meson directly via its gluonic component or through its su(3)-flavour - singlet admixture  @xcite .",
    "in order to investigate the isospin dependence of the meson production in hadronic interactions  @xcite , the cosy11 facility has been extended by a neutral  particle  detector .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0 meson production in the proton - neutron collision  @xcite has been conducted using a proton beam of the cooler synchrotron cosy  @xcite and a cluster jet deuteron target  @xcite .",
    "more details concerning functioning of the particular detectors and method of the measurement of the quasi - free reaction can be found in references  @xcite . in this article",
    "we will concentrate on the neutral particle detector  @xcite which has been designed to deliver the time at which the registered neutron or gamma quantum induced a hadronic or electromagnetic reaction , respectively .",
    "this information combined with the time of the reaction at the target place  deduced using other detectors  enables to calculate the time - of - flight between the target and the neutron detector and to determine the absolute momentum of registered paricles , provided that they could have been identified .",
    "+        the neutron detector consists of 24 modules .",
    "each module is built out of eleven plates of scintillator material with dimensions of 240  mm @xmath6 90  mm @xmath6 4  mm interlaced with eleven plates of lead with the same dimensions .",
    "the scintillators are read out at both edges of the module via light guides  made of plexiglass  whose shape changes from rectangular to cylindrical , in order to accumulate the produced light on the circular photocathode of a photomultiplier .",
    "the neutron detector is positioned at a distance of 7.36  m from the target with the configuration of modules schematically depicted in figure  [ neut_3d ] .",
    "the detector covers the neutron laboratory angular range of @xmath7 in x and @xmath8 in y direction .",
    "figure  [ neut ] ( left ) shows the distribution of the time  of ",
    "flight for all detection units .",
    "one can see a clear enhancement of events originating from gamma quanta . as expected from the known absorption coefficients  @xcite , gamma quanta",
    "are predominantly registered in the first row of the detector whereas interactions points of neutrons are distributed more homogeneously .",
    "+ the efficiency of the cosy11 neutral particle detector  which is an important factor for determining the absolute values of cross sections  was determined using two independent simulation programs .",
    "one of these programs is based on the geant-3 ( * ge*ometry * an*d * t*racking ) code  @xcite used for simulation of the hadronic cascades induced in matter by neutrons . in the other program the fluka ( * flu*ktuierende * ka*skade )",
    "simulation package is used  @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the simulated distributions of the total deposited energy in the neutron detector using fluka-2008 and the geant-3 packages , is presented in fig .",
    "the simulation was performed for neutrons with kinetic energy equal to 300 mev . as can be seen",
    ", the range of deposited energy is the same for both cases , however , geant simulations yield on the average higher energy response of the neutron detector . the efficiency of the neutron detector is given by the ratio of the number of generated neutrons to the number of events , for which the energy deposited in the scintillator material was larger than the threshold value in at least one of 24 detection units . the calculated efficiency as a function of the kinetic energy of neutrons is shown in fig .  [ fluka_geant ] ( left ) . in this figure",
    "open squares denote results obtained using the geant-3 package , and the outcome of simulations using the fluka-2008 is presented as black circles .",
    "the kinetic energy of neutrons from the @xmath9 reaction varies from 300  mev up to 700  mev for the 3.35  gev / c beam momentum , and as can be inspected from fig .",
    "[ fluka_geant ] ( left ) the efficiency is fairly constant in this range .",
    "it is worth to stress that two independent simulation tools leads to fairly good ( @xmath10 ) agreement for the values of the efficiency in the energy range relevant for the studies of the @xmath9 reaction .",
    "+ we have also conducted studies of the efficiency dependency on the threshold . in the experiment",
    "the threshold was set to about 0.1 mev and therefore we scanned the values from 0 up to 0.6  mev .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fluka_geant ] ( right ) .",
    "for both the geant and fluka-2008 simulations the values of the efficiency change by about 10% over the scanned threshold range of 0.6  mev .      having all outgoing nucleons from @xmath11 reaction registered , we apply the missing mass technique in order to identify the @xmath0 meson . due to the smaller efficiency and lower resolution for the registration of the quasi - free @xmath12 reaction in comparison to the measurements of the proton - proton reactions , the elaboration of the data encounters problems of low statistics .",
    "therefore , the excess energy range for @xmath13 has been divided only into four intervals of 8  mev width . for each interval",
    "we have calculated the missing mass .",
    "next , from events with negative q value the corresponding background missing mass spectrum was constructed , shifted to the kinematical limit and normalized to the experimental distribution at low mass values where no events of the @xmath0 meson production are expected . a detailed description of the method used for the background subtraction can be found in a dedicated article  @xcite . after subtracting missing mass distributions for the negative values of q from spectra for q values larger than 0  due to the very low signal  to  background ratio  at the present stage of the data analysis , the signal from the @xmath0 meson was found to be statistically insignificant .",
    "reaction as a function of the excess energy ( open symbols ) .",
    "upper limit for the total cross section for the @xmath11 reaction as a function of the excess energy ( closed symbols ) . ]    nevertheless , having the luminosity   established from the number of the quasi - free proton - proton elastic scattering events  @xcite   and the detection efficiency of the cosy-11 system we have estimated upper limits of the total cross section for the quasi - free @xmath9 reaction .",
    "the preliminary result is shown in fig .",
    "[ result ] .",
    "as already mentioned based on the @xmath14 reaction channel only it is not possible to determine the reaction machanism responsible for the @xmath0 production . to put more constrains on the theoretical models  @xcite and",
    "to learn more about the structure of the @xmath0 meson  @xcite we began investigations aiming at the determination of the dependence of the @xmath0 meson production on the isospin of the colliding nucleons .",
    "after the measurement of the @xmath15 reaction , we have extended our experimental studies to a pure isospin zero state of the interacting nucleons by the measurement of the quasi - free @xmath16 reaction .",
    "this experiment was conducted using a proton beam with a momentum of 3.365  gev / c and a deuteron target .",
    "assuming that the ratio of the cross sections for the @xmath16 and @xmath14 reactions will be at the same order as the ratio already established  @xcite for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 reactions we expect to identify about 1000 @xmath16 events in the available data sample  @xcite .",
    "+ an additional outcome of this measurement will be an increase of the statistics for the @xmath15 channel and a consistency check of the obtained results . + together with the previous results on @xmath14 and @xmath15 we would then complete the study of the @xmath0 meson production cross section in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the results obtained in different isospin channels can then be compared with theoretical models for the production of mesons .",
    "this will reduce significantly the ambiguities of such models and will lead to a better understanding of the production mechanism of the @xmath0 meson in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the result will be also of importance in rate estimates for studying the @xmath0 meson decays with the wasa - at - cosy facility  @xcite .",
