    "<S> we note the modulation of @xmath13 is about 40% , the @xmath6 range being set to avoid leakage across the lao layer . for back gate voltages @xmath10 , a large history dependent behavior manifests in @xmath12 when @xmath10 is first swept upwards and then downwards . </S>",
    "<S> in this geometry , from the as - grown state , @xmath12 first decreases and then saturates for a wide range of @xmath10 ( red curve in panel ( b ) ) . if we stop increasing @xmath10 ( at @xmath14 = 50v as in panel ( b ) ) and reverse the sweeping direction , we observe that the resistance increases strongly ( blue curve ) , deviating from the upward sweep . </S>",

    "<S> extremely high resistance states can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath10 exceeds @xmath14 , the resistance remains constant in the upward sweep ( green curve ) ; however , the new reversible behavior is shifted to higher voltages ( purple curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> this `` forming process '' of the resistance state suggests that many added electrons spill out of the quantum well and go into trapped states.@xcite    to build a more comprehensive understanding of the different effects of @xmath6 and @xmath10 , we investigate the magneto - transport properties of the 2del using both gates . </S>",
    "<S> the data are displayed in figure [ figure3 ] : in the left panels , the measurements are performed at various @xmath6 while @xmath10 is maintained fixed , and vice versa for the right panels . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the changes in @xmath13 induced by sweeping @xmath6 or @xmath10 are quite comparable , but on a completely different voltage range . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ figure3](c ) - [ figure3](f ) display the hall resistance @xmath11 as a function of magnetic field for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath10 : we observe an evolution from linear to non - linear behavior pointing to a transition from single to multiple band conduction.@xcite since correctly extracting the total carrier density @xmath15 from a non - linear @xmath11 is generally difficult , the modulation of the total carrier density @xmath16 is calculated using a parallel plate capacitor model . for the top gate , using @xmath5 = 12 , we obtain a change in @xmath15 that agrees with the estimation from the variation of the hall coefficient with @xmath6 when @xmath11 is linear in field ( see figure [ figure3](c ) ) . for the back gate , @xmath16 is obtained by the capacitor measurement as a function of @xmath10.@xcite these @xmath16 modulations are plotted as top axes in panels ( a ) and ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> now comparing the change in @xmath13 versus @xmath16 for the two gates , we see that the same @xmath13 modulation is achieved by top gate with a variation in @xmath15 that is roughly twice that obtained with the back gate .    </S>",
    "<S> this different response of @xmath13 to the top and back gates , as well as the evolution of the hall effect , may suggest distinct effects of the two gates on the confining potential and hence on the sub - band structure . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent calculations using a schr@xmath17dinger - poisson approach show that a pure increase in carrier density results in a stronger confinement.@xcite modeling of back gate transistors @xcite and analysis of back gate voltage sweeps @xcite indicate that positive voltages increase the confinement width ( weaker confinement ) of the 2del ; as a consequence , the energy splitting between the lower energy @xmath1 - and lower mobility - and higher energy @xmath2/@xmath3 - and higher mobility - bands should be reduced .     </S>",

    "<S> @xmath15 is estimated from the linear hall effect and the carrier change induced by the capacitor effect , and @xmath4 is defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the electron charge and @xmath19 is the zero - field conductance ; @xmath4 calculated in this fashion is therefore an effective mobility . in the same graphs </S>",
    "<S> , we use a color code to indicate the degree of non - linearity observed in the hall resistance @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the derivative @xmath24 at a given field . for single band conduction , @xmath25 is zero ( represented as blue ) while for multi - band conduction , it becomes non - zero ( represented as yellow / red ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mobility curves in figure [ figure4](a ) show that top gate sweeps result in a strong modulation of @xmath15 and a smaller change in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> when we change the back gate voltage , we notice a sharp increase in the carrier mobility : this is more evident in panel ( b ) where mobility is strongly enhanced by back gate voltages for a small variation in the carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that , concomitant with the increase in @xmath4 , the hall resistance becomes non - linear , suggesting that a second band with high mobility comes into play . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    a possible scenario to understand the response of the transport properties to the field - effect tuning relates the effect of the two gates to the confining potential . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , a deconfinement of the 2del would reduce the @xmath1 versus @xmath2/@xmath3 band splitting , this energy becoming negative in bulk sto . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite along with this effect , carriers could be transferred to the more mobile band , resulting in higher mobility and non - linear hall resistance . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if electrons are more confined , the energy splitting should increase , and a shift in the fermi level would mainly induce an increase in @xmath15 with little change in @xmath4 .     and spin - orbit @xmath26 characteristic fields as a function of the 2d carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> for each @xmath6 value , @xmath10 was swept typically between 35 and 60v ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the evolution of @xmath26 as a function of @xmath10 at three fixed carrier densities obtained with several combinations of @xmath6 and @xmath10 . </S>",

    "<S> we finally explore the effect of top and back gates on the spin - orbit interaction of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the magneto - conductance curves using the maekawa - fukuyama formula @xcite and extract the inelastic field @xmath30 and the spin - orbit field @xmath26 for different sets of @xmath6 and @xmath10.@xcite figure [ figure5 ] shows the evolution of @xmath31 and @xmath26 as a function of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that for each @xmath6 the back - gate tuning results in an effective modulation of @xmath26 , in agreement with previous studies on the spin - orbit interaction.@xcite while @xmath30 seems to be determined mainly by @xmath15 , @xmath26 should be more sensitive to the modification of the confining potential . to get further insight into the evolution of @xmath26 upon gate tuning , in the inset of figure [ figure5 ] , we plot @xmath26 versus @xmath10 for the three carrier densities indicated by the shaded areas in the main panel of the figure . for the plot , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is chosen as the  tuning parameter \" as it should affect the electron confining potential most and hence the strength of the spin - orbit interaction , although probably in a complex way.@xcite the data plotted in the inset show that the spin - orbit coupling can be tuned at constant @xmath15 and suggest that @xmath10 is indeed modifying the confinement of the 2del .    to conclude , we present a systematic study of the effects of top and back gate on lao / sto heterostructures </S>",
    "<S> . the detailed characterization reveals differences between the evolution of @xmath13 , @xmath11 and magneto - conductance using the two approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the observation for the back gate of a forming process and the strong enhancement of the electron mobility suggest that positive back gate deconfines the 2del : on one side some electrons are trapped deep in the sto ; on the other side , the contribution from @xmath2/@xmath3 states becomes more significant . </S>",
    "<S> the control of the electronic properties of the 2del using both gates , as demonstrated here , allows the spin - orbit strength to be tuned at fixed carrier densities and opens new opportunities to realize transistors where mobility and carrier density are tuned independently .    </S>",
