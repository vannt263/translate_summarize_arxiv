    "surveys of molecular clouds indicate that 60% of young stars form in clusters @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to study star formation in clusters to understand the influence of the cluster environment in the process of star and planet formation . of fundamental importance",
    "is the understanding of the spatial structure of clusters , and of the evolution of that structure .",
    "observations with the _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ space telescopes are of great importance in the study of cluster structure as they provide the means to identify young stellar objects from the protostellar to pre - main sequence phases , and to categorize these objects into the canonical evolutionary classes ( class 0/i , ii and iii @xcite ) .",
    "the number and distribution of sources in each of these classes provides unique information on the distribution of star formation sites , the motion of the stars after they form , and the dynamical state of the cluster at large . from these studies",
    ", we can better understand the physical processes that govern the fragmentation of molecular clouds , the ensuing trajectories that the resulting young stars make through the cluster , and the eventual fate of the embedded cluster .",
    "clusters also serve as laboratories for the evolution of young stellar objects , and can be used to study the evolution of disks around young stars and the evolution of hot x - ray emitting plasma commonly found around such stars ( see for example : @xcite )    in this paper , we describe a detailed study of the population of young stellar objects in the serpens cluster identified by observations with _ spitzer _ and _ chandra_. the serpens region is an example of a very young , deeply embedded cluster , containing a number of protostars @xcite . the embedded cluster is heavily extinguished , with a peak extinction exceeding 40 magnitudes in the visual . at a distance of @xmath0260",
    "pc , the serpens cloud core is one of the nearest regions of clustered star - formation to the sun ( see @xcite for a discussion of the distance to serpens ) .",
    "this makes it an excellent candidate for study with _",
    "spitzer _ as it is close enough to both resolve the individual members and to detect the lowest mass members to below the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "furthermore , the serpens cluster is rich in protostars .",
    "sub - millimetre and millimetre observations of the region , at 450  @xmath1 , 850  @xmath1 and 3  mm , identify at least 14 objects in the serpens cloud core @xcite . in this paper , we extend the sample of known young stellar objects in serpens using the high sensitivity of _ spitzer _ and _ chandra_. we then discuss three topics : the mid - ir spectral energy distributions of protostellar objects detected in the sub - millimeter , the spatial distribution of the serpens cluster members , and finally , the x - ray properties of the young stellar objects as a function of their evolutionary class .",
    "we have obtained _ spitzer _ images of the serpens cloud core in six wavelength bands : the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath3 m bands of the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) and the 24  @xmath3 m and 70  @xmath3 m bands of the multi - band imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; @xcite ) .",
    "the photometry extracted from these data was supplemented by @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11-band photometry from the 2mass point source catalog @xcite , resulting in data in nine photometric bands spanning 1 - 70  @xmath3 m .",
    "the uncertainties for the point sources as a function of magnitude are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the following analysis ,",
    "only data with uncertainties @xmath12  magnitudes were used .",
    "below , we describe the observations , image reduction and photometry for the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "the _ spitzer _ space telescope has observed the serpens cluster with the irac instrument at two different epochs .",
    "the first epoch was on 1st april 2004 ; these observations were part of the guaranteed time observation program pid 6 , _ the structure and incidence of embedded clusters_. the second epoch was on 5th april 2004 , during which _ spitzer _ executed observations from pid 174 from the _ cores to disks _ ( c2d ) legacy program .",
    "the mosaicked regions cover a @xmath13 field in all four of the irac wavelength bands ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the field is centered on the main serpens cluster in the northern cloud core .",
    "the observations were taken in the high dynamic range mode with a 12 second frame time . in each epoch , two dithered 10.4 second frames and two dithered 0.4 second frames were obtained at each map position .",
    "the analysis used the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) fits images from the s11.4 pipeline of the _ spitzer _ science center .",
    "these data were combined into mosaics using the mopex program .",
    "the 3.6  @xmath3 m and 4.5  @xmath3 m images were pre - processed by using the idl - based pulldown corrector by lexi moustakas , and then additional interactive processing steps were applied to locate and remove the remaining column pulldown and mux bleed artifacts in the 3.6  @xmath3 m and 4.5  @xmath3 m images , and banding effects in the 5.8  @xmath3 m and 8.0  @xmath3 m images @xcite .",
    "the overlap correction module was used to minimize instrumental offsets between adjacent frames , and the mosaics were constructed on a pixel scale of 0.8627 @xmath14/pixel , or @xmath15 the irac pixel size .",
    "the typical total integration time is 41.6 seconds per pixel , although in some regions near the edges of the mosaic , the integration time is 20.8 seconds .",
    "the calibration uncertainty across the irac bands is estimated at @xmath16  mag @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath05% position dependent variations in the calibration of point sources in the flat - fielded bcd data ; these have not been corrected for in our data .",
    "furthermore , these systematic uncertainties have not been added into the random photometric uncertainties reported in this paper .",
    "we used a custom idl program for point source finding ; this program was a heavily modified version of the daofind program in the idlphot package @xcite .",
    "this program first creates a smoothed version of the mosaic by convolving with a gaussian with @xmath17  pixels , approximately double the fwhm of the point sources , and then subtracts the smoothed version from the mosaic to filter out the extended nebulosity .",
    "the noise in a @xmath18 pixel region around the source was calculated to assess the combined instrumental noise , shot noise and noise from the spatially varying extended nebulosity .",
    "point sources with peak values more than 5 @xmath19 above the background were considered candidate detections .",
    "after the point sources were identified , aperture photometry then was obtained using the aper.pro program in the idlphot package .",
    "an aperture radius of 2.8 pixels ( @xmath20 ) was used , and a sky annulus from 4.2 to 8.4 pixels ( @xmath21 to @xmath22 ) was used to measure the contribution from extended emission in the aperture .",
    "the zero points for these apertures were , 17.8204 , 17.3025 , 16.7408 , and 15.9440  mag for the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath3 m bands , respectively , in the native bcd image units of mjy pixels sr@xmath23 .",
    "there were 25853 , 22703 , 6595 , and 3946 detections in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath1 respectively , with uncertainties less than 0.2  mag , with 2758 of these detected in all four irac bands .",
    "the sensitivity of the 8.0  @xmath1 band is the limiting factor in four band detections : it suffers from lower photospheric fluxes , higher background emission , and the presence of bright , structured nebulosity in some parts of the image .",
    "the detection threshold in the 3.6  @xmath1 band was 17 magnitudes - far below the hydrogen burning limit for a 1  myr old star at the distance of serpens ( @xmath012  mag at 3.6  @xmath3 m @xcite ) .",

    "the medium scan rate was used . for the first epoch ,",
    "part of the guaranteed time observation program pid 6 , taken on the 6th april 2004 , six 0.5 degree scan legs with full - array cross - scan offsets were used . for the second epoch observations ( pid 174 ) , 12th april 2005 , 12 scan legs of length 0.5",
    "degrees and half - array cross - scan offsets were used . in both epochs ,",
    "the total map size was approximately 0.5 x 1.5 degrees including the overscan region .",
    "all three mips bands are taken simultaneously in this mode ; because the data at 160 micron are saturated , we do not consider it in our subsequent analysis .",
    "the 2nd epoch map had full 70  @xmath3 m coverage , while the first epoch mapped only six @xmath24 wide bands , covering half of the map .",
    "both epochs were combined to form the final maps .",
    "the typical effective exposure time per pixel is about 80 seconds at 24  @xmath3 m and 40 seconds at 70  @xmath3 m .",
    "the mips images were processed using the mips instrument team data analysis tool , which calibrates the data and applies a distortion correction to each individual exposure before combining into a final mosaic @xcite .",
    "the data were further processed using various median filters to remove saturation effects and column - dependent background structure .",
    "the resulting mosaics have a pixel size of @xmath25 at 24  @xmath3 m and @xmath26 at 70  @xmath3 m .",
    "stars in the 24  @xmath3 m mosaic were then identified using photvis @xcite , which searched for all point sources with peaks 5 times the rms noise .",
    "aperture photometry in a 5 pixel aperture was performed on these sources with photvis and the photometry was corrected to a 12 pixel aperture radius , with a sky annulus from 12 - 15 pixels .",
    "adopting a conversion of 6.711 jy per @xmath27 , multiplying by @xmath28 to correct for the smaller mosaic pixels and by 1.146 to correct from a 12 mosaic pixel aperture to an infinite aperture , and using a zero magnitude flux of 7.3 jy , the aperture photometry was converted to magnitudes . due to the larger @xmath29 fwhm of the mips 24  @xmath3 m point spread function ( psf ) , we performed psf fitting photometry on all the detected sources using the idl version of daophot in the idlphot package .",
    "the psf was generated from six bright ( 3 - 6 magnitude ) stars in the image ; these stars were chosen to be bright and uncontaminated by nebulosity .",
    "psf fitting photometry was then performed on the point source detections using the nstar.pro routine in idlphot .",
    "the nstar routine requires the input of aperture photometry .",
    "sky values were taken from an annulus from 12 to 15 pixels .",
    "these photometry are then adjusted by fitting the psf to the image data and scaling accordingly .",
    "a total of 269 sources were extracted with uncertainties less than 0.2  mag .",
    "three of the sources , numbers 11 , 35 , and 36 , were saturated at 24  @xmath3 m .",
    "the fits of these data were adjusted by scaling the point spread function manually , subtracing the psf from the image , and visually inspecting the residual in the wings of the psf .",
    "the tabulated magnitudes produced the lowest apparent residual .",
    "since raising / lowering the magnitudes by 0.1  mag would produce a distinct over / undersubtraction in the residual image , we adopted an uncertainty of 0.1 magnitude for these values .",
    "the 70  @xmath3 m photometry was extracted from the mosaic using a similar procedure to the 24  @xmath3 m photometry .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on the sources in a 3.66 pixel aperature , with a sky annulus from 3.66 - 7.92 pixels .",
    "the conversion used was 0.675 jy per @xmath27 , with a factor of 1.927 correcting from a 3.66 pixel to an infinite aperture , and a zero magnitude flux of 0.775 jy .",
    "psf photometry was not performed on the point sources as there were not enough detections uncontaminated by nebulosity to generate the psf .",
    "the fwhm of the psf at 70  @xmath3 m is 18@xmath14 .",
    "the typical uncertainty on the 70  @xmath3 m flux is 15% .",
    "the x - ray data were taken from the @xmath30 anchors ( an archive of chandra observations of regions of star formation ) archive , obsid 4479 .",
    "the raw x - ray data are dominated by events of non - astrophysical origin . to remove these ,",

    "file , a gain correction ( conversion from pulse heights to x - ray energy ) is applied from caldb 2.21 .",
    "the cti correction for pulse heights distorted by charge transfer inefficiency and vfaint background cleaning to remove soft cosmic rays were also applied .",
    "next an energy filter was applied to remove photons above 8  kev and below 300  ev which are typically not of stellar origin .",
    "finally events with bad grades and bad status ( grades 1 , 5 and 7 , status @xmath320 indicative of x - ray signals ) and bad time intervals were filtered using the ciao tool _",

    "the serpens field contains 19,181 sources with a detection in at least one band with photometric uncertainty @xmath44 in the ir - field ( 122 having detections in all five bands ) ; however , only a small fraction of these are bona fide ysos .",
    "three methods were applied to these data to identify possible young stellar objects : selection of stars with ir excesses on ir color - color diagrams , identification of x - ray luminous ysos by comparison of x - ray sources with ir detections , and finally , a search for extremely red mid - ir sources among the detections .",
    "young stellar objects can be identified by their excess emission at ir wavelengths .",
    "this emission arises from reprocessed stellar radiation in the dusty material of their natal envelopes or circumstellar disks .",
    "the infrared identification of ysos is carried out by identifying sources that possess colors indicative of ir excess and distinguishing them from reddened and/or cool stars @xcite .",
    "the main limitation of this method is the contamination from extragalactic sources such as pah - rich star - forming galaxies and agn ; both of these have colors similar to young stellar objects .",
    "four color - color diagrams were used to determine the color excess of the sources : an irac [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] vs. [ 5.8 ] - [ 8.0 ] diagram , an irac - mips [ 3.6 ] - [ 4.5 ] vs. [ 8.0 ] - [ 24 ] diagram , and two irac-2mass diagrams j - h vs. h - [ 4.5 ] and h - k vs. k - [ 4.5 ] , fig.[fig7 ] . in the following analysis we required all photometry to have uncertainties @xmath44  mags in all bands used for a _",
    "particular _ color - color diagram .",
    "the numbers of sources for each diagram which satisfy this criteria are 2417 , 122 , 3748 , and 4251 , respectively .      to identify sources with true ir excesses , it is necessary to distinguish between reddened or cool stars and those with excess emission arising from heated dust grains .",
    "a reddening law in the irac bands was determined by flaherty et al.(2006 ) , which shows the [ 5.8 ] - [ 8.0 ] color to be particularly insensitive to reddening and stellar temperature , and is thus a reliable measure of excess emission due to dust .",
    "sources with a color @xmath45 beyond @xmath46 - [ 8.0 ] > 0.2 $ ] mag are likely to possess excesses and not to be reddened or cool stars ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "extragalactic sources such as pah rich star - forming galaxies and agn will also satisfy this criteria @xcite .",
    "sources with a color more than @xmath47 below @xmath48 - [ 4.5 ] < 0.1 $ ] were considered galaxies and were removed ; those with a 24  @xmath1 detection are reconsidered separately .",
    "gutermuth et al.(submitted ) have recently developed a method for substantially reducing extragalactic contamination built on the bootes shallow survey data @xcite and the _ spitzer cores to disks _ legacy program methods @xcite .",
    "the galaxies are eliminated either by their colors , which unlike ysos are often dominated by pah features in the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 bands , or by their faintness .",
    "agn are typically much fainter than the ysos found in nearby star - forming regions and are removed by this criterion .",
    "it should be noted that very faint or embedded flat spectrum sources may be erroneously filtered by this method also .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams used to identify star - forming galaxies with strong pah emission and agn .",
    "nebulosity may also result in the misidentification of sources .",

    "these sources appear to have their 8.0  @xmath1 photometry contaminated by the nebulosity and were removed from the sample . in general",
    ", all sources with [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] excesses which do not show an excess at 24  @xmath1 excess or a @xmath48-[4.5 ] > 0.1 $ ] are removed .    in total , 146 potential ysos were identified in the irac color - color diagram . of these , 62 are likely to be contaminants and have been removed from the source list .      the shorter wavelength 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 irac bands are much more sensitive to stellar photospheres than the longer wavelength 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 bands ; where the shorter wavelength bands have 17,385 and 15,539 detections with @xmath49 , respectively , the longer wavelength bands having 4,670 and 2721 detections .",
    "hence many sources can not be characterized with the irac color - color diagram .",
    "for this reason , it is important to develop methods to identify sources with infrared excesses that rely only on the shorter wavelength bands . since we can not distinguish between reddening and infrared excess from circumstellar dust with only two bands , we combine the near - ir data from the 2mass point source catalog with the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath1 band photometry @xcite .",
    "this provides the ability to detect objects which are too faint for detection in the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 bands .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on the @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 $ ] diagram and the @xmath52 vs @xmath51 $ ] diagram . these diagrams take advantage of the excellent sensitivity of _ spitzer _ in the 4.5  @xmath3 m band and the stronger infrared excess emission at 4.5  @xmath3 m compared to that at shorter wavelength @xcite . for highly reddened sources which are not detected in the @xmath9-band",

    "the observed gas densities range from @xmath112  @xmath114 to @xmath113  @xmath114 @xcite .",

    ", competitive accretion remains a viable process for the formation of stars in the serpens cluster .    finally , the close spacing and velocities of the protostars in the northern group suggest that their envelopes could impinge on one another .",
    "we note that the 3  mm continuum observations ( @xmath130 beamsize ) of @xcite did not resolve the the sizes of the protostars in the northern group of serpens .",
    "this does not rule out our previous estimates that the accretion volumes extend 5000 to 10,000 au ; the bima measurements may only be sensivite to dense inner regions of the protostars .",
    "however , for the present analysis , we use a size of 1000  au , assuming that the protostars are spheres with diameters just below the angular resolution of the bima observations .",
    "we follow the analysis in @xcite , adopting a mass of 0.5  m@xmath127 , a velocity of 0.26  km  s@xmath23 and a peak density for the northern group of seven protostars in a volume 0.1  pc in diameter .",
    "the resulting time between collisions for a given object is 200,000 years , less than the protostellar lifetime .",
    "consequently , if the objects in this group remain in bound orbits within this region for 300,000 years , the typical protostellar lifetime @xcite , all of the protostars could experience collisions between their envelopes and the envelopes of other protostars in the group .    in summary , jean s length ,",
    "bonner - ebert sphere and simple volumetric arguments all suggest that the accreting envelopes around the protostars in serpens are often tightly packed , if not overlapping .",
    "we find that for the conditions present in the northern group , the protostars may accrete a significant amount of their mass through bondi - hoyle accretion from a common envelope , and competitive accretion may occur within the group .",
    "furthemore , collisions between the sources are likely . in total , our analysis suggests that the interactions between protostars can play an important role in the formation of stars within the dense groups observed in serpens .      using the models of @xcite we calculate the magnitude of the hydrogen burning limit at k - band to be 12.5 mag for an assumed 1  myr old cluster at a distance of 260  pc to serpens .",
    "of the 138 sources in serpens , 34 have k - band detections fainter than 12.5 magnitudes , 2 of which are class 0/i and one flat spectrum . since we can not measure the dereddened photospheric luminosities of the class 0/i and flat spectrum objects , these sources are discounted , leaving 31 candidate ( 23 class ii and 8 class iii ) brown dwarfs members .",
    "@xcite has also identified numerous substellar candidates in the serpens b cluster to the south of the core .",
    "we can not rule out that these sources are older objects or objects that appear underluminous for other reasons @xcite .",
    "searches for brown dwarfs in other regions have shown that infrared spectroscopy is essential to confirm that faint objects are protostellar in nature @xcite .",
    "assuming that the 23 class ii objects were to be positively identified as substellar , this would lead to an upper limit of 23/138 or 17% of the total yso population being substellar .",
    "this would be somewhat higher than the substellar fractions found in chameleon 1 ( 5% ) and ic348 ( 8% ) @xcite , though in agreement with @xcite , who estimate 20% of serpens sources are substellar .",
    "interestingly , the spatial distribution of the @xmath131 12.5 class ii objects appears more extended that the brighter class ii ( fig .",
    "[ figbdc ] ) .",
    "in particular , although smaller in number , the most distant objects north , west , and east of the core of the cluster have @xmath131 12.5 .",

    "this photometry allows us to accurately ascertain the evolutionary class of each object , and study the dependence of the x - ray properties with evolutionary state .",
    "only those detections with x - ray count in excess of 100 were considered when examining emission properties to ensure reliable estimates .    of the 138 identified members , 60",

    "since we can not identify class iii sources without x - ray emission , we can not establish the fraction of class iii sources detected in x - rays . as we will argue subsequently ,",
    "the x - ray properties of the class ii and lii objects appear to be indistinguishable . assuming that this similarity holds for the fraction of detected sources , then the fraction of classs iii sources detected is the same as that for the class ii objects , and we estimate the total number of class iii objects to be @xmath136 . if , further , we take into account that the irx - field contains only 71% of the class ii population , and we assume that the class iii sources show a similar spatial distribution , then the total population of class iii objects may be as high as 65 .",

    "the colors of the class ii objects can be affected by both absorption and scattering of the light from the central source by a flared disk ; the extent of this effect would be determined , predominantly , by the inclination of the disk and the sizes of grains in the disk @xcite .",
    "for example , the colors of an edge - on disk system , where the central star is highly obscured by the disk , would be dominated by scattered light .",
    "in such a case , the disk absorbs both the infrared and the x - ray emission from the star , but the scattered infrared light reduces the observed reddening of the star and hence the inferred value of @xmath6 . to eliminate the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath6 due to circumstellar material , we fit only the class iii objects .",

    "the collision time between grains is @xcite @xmath186 v_d [ km~s^{-1}])^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a @xmath187 and a velocity of 0.1  km  s@xmath23 @xcite , the collision timescale is 30,000 years .",
    "thus it is likely that a dust grain in the serpens cloud would have had multiple collisions with other grains .",
    "alternatively , the growth can be through the accretion of mantles of volatiles such as h@xmath188o , nh@xmath189 , o@xmath188 , n@xmath188 and co. the accretion timescale is given by @xmath190 where s is the specific density of the mantle , @xmath191 is the change in the size of the dust grain due to the mantle , @xmath192 is the sticking coefficient ( @xmath193 ) , @xmath194 is the temperature of the gas , @xmath195 is the density of the molecule forming the mantle , and @xmath183 is the mass of the molecule forming the mantle @xcite .",
    "thus the rate of mantle accretion is proportional to the density of the gas ; again , the high density of the gas in the serpens cloud would accelerate the rate of mantle accretion .",
    "a detailed calculation of the rate requires consideration of the gas phase abundances of the different possible volatiles , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "self consistent modeling of the extinction over multiple wavelength bands is needed to study the impact of grain growth on both the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath6 and the shape of extinction law with which @xmath6 is derived .",
    "further observational work is also needed to confirm our observed @xmath175 slope using a larger number of class iii objects from multiple star forming regions . however",
    ", this study demonstrates the value of using combined chandra , near - ir , and spitzer observations to identify deeply embedded class iii objects and search for variations in the extinction law within molecular clouds .",
    "we have undertaken an intensive study of the serpens cloud core in the mid - ir with _",
    "spitzer _ and in the near - ir with 2mass .",
    "we have merged these data with _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations and investigated various x - ray properties of protostars and pre - main sequence stars .",
    "these data provide perhaps the most complete census to date of the young stellar objects in one of the nearest embedded clusters to the sun .",
    "* we identify 138 young stellar objects , after removing contamination .",
    "these include 38 protostars ( 22 class 0/i , 16 flat spectrum ) and 100 pre - main sequence stars ( 62 class ii , 17 transition disks , and 21 class iii ) . the ratio of protostellar objects ( class 0/i and flat spectrum ) to pre - main sequence stars ( class ii , transition disk , and class iii ) is 38:100 or 29% of the total number of identified members .",
    "the ratio of protostars to pre - main sequence stars with disks is 48% .",
    "these high numbers indicate that serpens is unusually rich in protostars .",
    "we estimate that as many as 44 class iii sources may be missing , implying a total membership of 182 .",
    "* we have searched for _ spitzer _ counterparts to 14 ( sub)mm sources in the serpens cluster .",
    "seven are detected as point sources at 3.6 - 8.0  @xmath1 , a total of 10 have been detected at 24  @xmath1 , and an additional two show nebulosities at @xmath196  @xmath1 .",
    "all but one are coincident with 70  @xmath1 emission , although for many of the protostars , the low angular resolution of the 70  @xmath1 data precludes accurate photometry of the sources . *",
    "we find that the spatial distribution of the protostars is distinctly different than the pre - main sequence stars . while the class 0/i sources and most of the flat spectrum sources are concentrated in the central molecular gas filament , the class ii , transition disk and class iii sources are distributed over a much more extended region .",
    "the median projected spacing of the class 0/i sources is only 5000  au ; these sources are highly clustered .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of the remaining classes are statistically indistinguishable from a random distribution . *",
    "the protostars are concentrated in two groups coincident with the two dominant molecular gas clumps , as has been previously reported .",
    "the density of protostars in these groups suggest that the volumes of gas from which these protostars accrete may touch or overlap .",
    "the spacing is also similar to both the jean s length and the radii of critical bonner ebert spheres .",
    "based on published ambient gas densities and velocities of the protostars in the northern group , we find that competitive accretion could be occurring in this groups .",
    "furthermore , collisions between protostellar envelopes may be common .",
    "* of the 138 sources , 60 exhibit detectable x - ray emission .",
    "nine of the detections are associated with class i sources ( 43% of members in class ) , a further eight with flat spectrum members ( 56% ) .",
    "twenty - one detections have class ii counterparts ( 45% ) , while only two of the transition disks are detected in x - rays ( 25% ) . twenty class iii sources were identified solely by their x - ray emission .",
    "there appears to be no evidence of a trend in the detection rate of sources by evolutionary class .",
    "the fraction of x - ray detected pre - main sequence stars ( i.e. class ii , transition disks and class iii sources ) with disks is 51% .",
    "* we find no evidence for a dependence of the temperature of the x - ray emitting plasma on the evolutionary class , and find no difference in the x - ray luminosity of detected class ii and classs iii objects .",
    "consequently , there is no evidence that the generation mechanism of the x - ray emission depends on the presence of an infalling envelope or circumstellar disk .",
    "* we find an observed relationship of @xmath165 , which is much shallower than found in other studies .",
    "the most likely explanation for this is a change in the near - ir reddening law that would affect the shape and magnitude of the reddening law .",
    "such changes could result from grain coagulation and/or grain growth from the accretion of mantles of volatiles ; both such processes may occur relatively quickly due to the high gas ( and presumably dust grain ) densities in the serpens cloud core .",
