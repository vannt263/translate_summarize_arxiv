    "an extremely cold spot ( cs ) , apparently inconsistent with the assumption of statistically homogeneous gaussian fluctuations , was detected in a wavelet analysis ( vielva et al .",
    "2004 ; cruz et al . 2005 ; cayon , jin and treaster 2005 ; cruz et al . 2006 ) of the first - year data release from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) .",
    "more recently , the existence of this spot has been confirmed by cruz et al .",
    "( 2007a ) the wmap third year data release ( hinshaw et al . 2007 ; spergel et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the wmap cs is centered at the position @xmath9 in galactic coordinates and has a characteristic scale about @xmath10 . as was pointed out by cruz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the frequency dependence of the signal in the spot area is extremely flat .",
    "this fact has been used by the authors mentioned above to argue that the wmap cs belongs to the cmb signal , rather than any form of foreground emission .",
    "cruz et al . ( 2006 ) pointed out that the reason the cs was not been detected in real space before the wavelet analysis was that it was hidden amongst structures at different scales .",
    "as an apparent example of non - gaussian behaviour in the wmap cmb signal , the cs has attracted very serious attention from the theoretical point of view .",
    "tomita ( 2005 ) suggested that the cs can be related to second - order gravitational effects .",
    "inoue and silk ( 2007 ) proposed a model involving local compensated voids .",
    "the origin of the cs in connection to the brightness and number of counts of the nvss sources ( smoothed on the scale of a few degrees ) was recently discussed by rudnick , brown and williams ( 2007 ) .",
    "they have detected a 20 - 45@xmath11 dip in the smoothed nvss source counts which can be interpreted , they argue , as a manifestation of the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , seen for a single region of the cmb sky .",
    "jaffe et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , cayon et al . ( 2006 ) , and mcewen et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) have investigated the bianchi vii@xmath12 anisotropic cosmological model as a possible explanation of the cs and other features of the wmap low multipoles .",
    "recently , cruz et al . (",
    "2007b ) have pointed out that the cs could be produced by a cosmic texture , assuming that the cmb signal is a combination of the gaussian and non - gaussian parts .",
    "the present status of the problem of existence of the cs remains uncertain , despite the presence of a vast collection of theoretical suggestions .",
    "nevertheless , if we believe that one particular part of the wmap cmb signal contains non - gaussian features , it would be necessary to seek corroborating evidence of non - gaussianity elsewhere in order to understand their properties more fully .",
    "in this paper we therefore present a detailed investigation of the properties of the cs , focusing attention on the following topics .",
    "first , in section 2 , we show how the cs can be easily detected in the pixels domain not only in the derived cmb signal , but even in the wmap maps for k - w bands before separation of the signal into cmb and foreground components .",
    "second , we will demonstrate that the cs belongs to a cluster of local minima , the spatial distribution of which is modulated by the large - angle modes of the cmb signal outside the galactic plane . for",
    "that we use the internal linear combination ( ilc ) iii map and the co - added wcm map with @xmath13 in the healpix format , converted to glesp format ( doroshkevich et al .",
    "2003 ) , where each iso - latitude ring has the same number of pixels @xmath14 in azimuthal direction @xmath15 in polar coordinates .",
    "after that we perform a cluster analysis ( novikov and jorgensen 1996 ) of the positive and negative peaks for selected rings in the area outside the kp0 mask , mostly concentrating our attention on the ring crossing the cs at its extremum @xmath0 and @xmath16 . taking into consideration the signal for each ring with the latitude @xmath17 , we can investigate the morphology of the cmb signal at each latitude for the whole range of @xmath15 . this approach allows to connect the morphology of the cs to the signal outside the cs for the same latitude @xmath0 .",
    "we will show that the cluster contained the cs , is not a unique feature of the @xmath0 iso - latitude ring .",
    "for example , close to the cs there are two significant clusters of maxima , but these peaks have lower amplitude that the cs .",
    "next , since the origin of large clusters of extrema is related to the angular modulation of the signal on large scales ( see novikov and jorgensen 1996 ) , we split the cmb signal into two parts . to do that we use the skewness and the kurtosis of the signal for selected rings , including the @xmath0 ring .",
    "then by using a simple linear smoothing filter with characteristic scale @xmath6 we separate the signal into a smoothed component and to a difference between initial signal and the smoothed component . for the smoothed signal",
    "we define the skewness @xmath18 and the kurtosis @xmath19 as a functions of @xmath6 and find the scale of filtering which maximize both these characteristics @xmath20 . by using this scale @xmath21 we separate the initial cmb signal in two parts , one of them ( the smoothed one ) contain a maximally non - gaussian signal , and the another one ( initial signal minus the smoothed one ) the maximally gaussian signal .",
    "the non - gaussian part is mainly formed by the signal localized at the range of multipoles @xmath22 and the other one belongs to the @xmath23 multipoles .",
    "our analysis clearly demonstrates that the pronounced non - gaussianity of the cs reflects directly the existence of a large - scale angular modulation of the cmb signal with @xmath7",
    ".    finally , using cluster analysis in combination with skewness and kurtosis statistics , we are able to detect a few additional cold and hot spots on the same @xmath0 ring as the famous one . to show that the effect on clustering of the peak by low multipoles of the cmb is very common",
    ", we took into consideration the north galactic hemisphere with deficit of the power and have found a few cold and hot spots .",
    "the idea of implementing of cluster analysis in combination with skewness and kurtosis statistics was stimulated by vielva et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , cruz et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 , 2007a ) , cayon , jin and treaster ( 2005 ) , and especially eriksen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and larson and wandelt ( 2005 ) . in our analysis",
    "we use both the wcm map and the ilc third year map , which are very similar outside the @xmath24 cut of the galactic plane . for our analysis",
    "we use the high resolution ilc iii map as a guide map to mark possible zones of the cmb sky in which the enhanced clustering of the peaks is expected to be considerable .",
    "= 0.6 = 0.6    as was pointed out in the introduction , historically the cs was detected in the wmap data as one of the deepest minima of the cmb signal , using method based on wavelets .",
    "our first aim is to show that this cs can actually be detected quite straightforwardly in the pixel domain using simple thresholding techniques . in fig.[f1 ] we take two thresholds of the ilc iii signal at the range of temperatures @xmath25 and @xmath26 and map them with a color scale @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "= 0.6 = 0.6 = 0.6    from this figure one can immediately see the difference in statistical properties of the positive and negative thresholds of the map .",
    "first of all , it is important to note that a majority of the positive peaks are associated with the area around @xmath29 ( see the bottom plot ) , while the negative peaks are present well outside this region of the map .",
    "secondly , the amplitude of the highest positive peaks is limited by @xmath30 , while for the negative peaks it is about @xmath31 . for the cs",
    "the temperature of the negative peak is in agreement with the estimate of cruz et al .",
    "( 2007a ) . in fig.[f2 ] , by using the sky viewer , we map the ilc iii k and ka maps , in which the cs is located in the center of the area marked by the black circle ( the blue cluster of peaks inside the black circle ) . from the k and ka maps",
    "one can clearly see that the cs is clearly observed even without subtraction of the cmb signal . in agreement with rudnick , brown and williams ( 2007 )",
    "we note that there is a cluster of negative peaks , rather than one single peak .    to show the local structure of the zone containing the cs , in fig.[f3 ] we plot high resolution ( @xmath32 ) images of the inner structure of the cs zone , including the haslam et al .",
    "( 1982 ) map .",
    "= 0.36 = 0.36 = 0.36 = 0.36    from fig.[f2 ] and fig.[f3 ] one can draw the important conclusion that the zone of the cs is surrounded by zones of hot spots , clearly seen in fig.[f2 ] just on the right and left hand side of the cs .",
    "if the origin of the cs is related to large - angular modulation of the cmb map and possible anisotropy of the power distribution across the sky , it would be naturally to expect that additionally to the wmap cs detected by vielva et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and others , we could find other cold and hot spots similar or even equal morphological properties . to show that this is the case for wcm and the ilc iii maps , in the next section we will use a cluster analysis of these maps in order to mark possible zones of peculiar distribution ( clusters ) in the signal .",
    "the main idea behind our implementation of cluster analysis is to divide the cmb sky above and below the kp0 mask into iso - latitude rings and then to analyze the properties of the signal for each ring separately .",
    "first , let us briefly describe the statistical properties of the signal @xmath33 for fixed latitude @xmath17 .",
    "let us take under consideration the distribution of peaks above and below some given threshold @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the square root of the variance @xmath36 for each ring .",
    "for a one - dimensional cross - section of the cmb map we introduce a definition of a cluster of maxima considering , for example , two points , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) from the ring . if for all the points in the interval @xmath40 we have @xmath41 , we call these points @xmath42 connected to each other with respect to the threshold @xmath43",
    ". a collection of maxima of @xmath44 located at the points @xmath45 we will call a cluster of length @xmath46 if all the points @xmath47 are connected to each other when the threshold @xmath43 is applied .. ] the length of the cluster @xmath48 is an analogue of the definition of the two - dimensional area ( cruz et al .",
    "2007a ) , but in a one - dimensional case .",
    "for a random gaussian field the statistic of length of the clusters ( one - dimensional ) and the area ( two - dimensional ) are similarly sensitive to the spectral parameters of the random field , as described by by bardeen et al .",
    "however , the difference between cluster analysis and area statistics becomes obvious in application to non - gaussian random fields .",
    "let us assume for a moment that some zone of the signal is characterized by the area statistic , and that this has a very non - gaussian value . to characterize the properties of the non - gaussian field it seems to be very important to know , if this area is related to a uniform structure with one single peak , or formed from a cluster of peaks with the same area .",
    "this is why for our analysis of the wcm and the ilc iii statistical properties we prefer to use cluster analysis ( ca ) . in our analysis , in addidition to the length of cluster @xmath46 , we will use its size @xmath3 which we define as the number of maxima ( or minima ) above ( or below ) the threshold @xmath43 within the interval length @xmath48 .      to describe the statistical properties of equal latitude rings",
    "we will use the approach proposed by chiang and naselsky ( 2007 ) .",
    "the standard treatment for a full - sky cmb signal @xmath49 is via spherical harmonic decomposition : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the polar and azimuthal angle , respectively , and @xmath53 are the spherical harmonic coefficients . here",
    "@xmath54 are the spherical harmonics , defined in terms of legendre polynomials and plane waves : @xmath55 where @xmath56 for a random gaussian cmb sky the properties of the statistical ensemble of realizations are completely specify by the power spectrum @xmath57 while for each single realization we expect to find some deviation from @xmath58 due to the `` cosmic variance '' effect . below we will use a polar coordinate system in which the galactic plane ( @xmath59 ) is associated with @xmath60 .",
    "let us analyse the signal @xmath61 from the equal - latitude ring at @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a one - dimensional signal , for which we can construct a fourier transform with coefficients @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 we can then relate the ring to the full - sky signal via eq.([eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) and get @xmath67 that is to say that the fourier coefficients @xmath64 of the ring can be expressed as a combination of the full - sky @xmath53 . defining the variance of the signal for equal latitude ring as @xmath68 ^ 2,\\hspace{0.05 cm } \\langle t\\rangle=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\varphi t(\\varphi ) \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] and after substitution of eq.([eq6 ] ) into eq.([eq8 ] ) we have @xmath69    for a random gaussian field ( grf ) , after average over realizations , the combinations of the @xmath53 coefficients in eq.([eq9 ] ) satisfy the following conditions : @xmath70 and then @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the window function of the ring .",
    "our approach here is a special case for a well known theoretical prediction : any @xmath73 dimensional cross sections of @xmath74 dimensional gaussian random signal produce a gaussian signal as well .",
    "however , this general theory tells us about the grf , represented as a sets of realizations .",
    "for one single realization of the cmb sky , as the wmap signal does ,",
    "the eq.([eq11 ] ) is no longer available .",
    "more general , instead of eq.([eq11 ] ) we have @xmath75 thus , @xmath76 the matrix @xmath77 describes the coupling between different modes @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the random process @xmath80 , which leads to variations of the variance @xmath81 for different rings ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "one can see that integration of eq.([eq14 ] ) over @xmath51 preserves spontaneous correlations ( @xmath83 ) even for the whole sky .",
    "however , for a particular ring we will have an additional modulation of these correlations depending on the @xmath51 through the window function @xmath84 . in fig.[ff ] we show the dependence of @xmath85 on the galactic latitude for the wcm and the ilc iii maps .",
    "= 0.8    first of all , we stress the remarkable similarity of these maps outside the region of the kp0 mask .",
    "moreover , the variance of the wcm map per each ring matches the variance of the ilc iii almost exactly for all latitudes , except for the @xmath86 zone .",
    "secondly , note that the @xmath0 ring lies near to the local maxima of the variance .",
    "the width of this zone is about @xmath87 .",
    "thirdly , from fig.[ff ] one can clearly see the asymmetry of the variance for the rings located at the north and the south hemispheres .",
    "no special analysis is required to observe that the variance of the southern hemisphere is higher than for the north .",
    "this result is in agreement with eriksen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) investigations of the asymmetry of the power per @xmath10 patches of the sky , and larson and wandelt et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analysis of peak statistics .",
    "furthermore , looking at fig.[ff ] at @xmath88 one can find the global maxima of the variance outside the kp0 mask .",
    "this zone is clearly seen in fig.[f1 ] just below the galactic plane as a large cluster of minima .",
    "could the origin of this cluster be the same as for the cluster around the cs  ? to answer this question we need to look closely on the properties of the signal for the ring @xmath0 in the azimuthal direction .      in this section",
    "we draw attention to the azimuthal distribution of the signal for the iso - latitude ring with @xmath0 , which contains the cs . in fig.[f4 ] we plot @xmath89 for wcm and the ilc iii maps smoothed by the angle @xmath90 .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that there are no significant differences of morphology of the cs in the ilc iii and wcm maps . in the following analysis we change the reference system of coordinate from the galactic one to one in which @xmath91 is associated with the galactic center and then all the values of @xmath15",
    "are counted clockwise up to @xmath92 .",
    "the glesp pixelization allow us to fix the same number of pixels for each iso - latitude ring ( @xmath93 ) and consequently the location of each pixel @xmath94 is related to the angle @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "= 0.8    in fig.[f4 ] the cs is clearly seen at @xmath97 as a cluster of minima ( c10 , n=10 ) of the signal in the wcm and ilc iii maps . moreover , there are no significant differences between these two signals either for the whole ring , or for the zone of the cs .",
    "fig.[f5 ] shows the distribution of the length of the clusters versus the number of cluster .",
    "clusters of maxima are shown in black , minima in red .",
    "as one can see from fig.[f5 ] there are about 17 clusters of maxima and 17 clusters of minima .",
    "the mean length of the ilc and wcm clusters of maxima @xmath98 , while for the clusters of minima we get @xmath99 . for comparison , after taking 1000 realizations for the grf with the wmap best fit @xmath100cdm power spectrum we have found @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the cluster c10 containing the cs has length @xmath103 and its dimension is @xmath104 at @xmath105 . at the same time",
    "@xmath106 at @xmath105 .",
    "these ratios tell us that this cluster looks like an `` ordinary '' cluster defined by the threshold @xmath105 without any significant deviation from the statistical properties of a random gaussian field .",
    "however , the extraordinary properties of this cluster become obvious when we take into consideration other thresholds , @xmath107 . from fig.[f5 ] we see that even for this range of @xmath43 the cluster still appears as a cluster of minima at the level @xmath108 , and local maxima at @xmath109 .",
    "novikov and jorgensen ( 1996 ) have pointed out that for the cluster of minima with @xmath110 the conditional probability @xmath111 to find two negative peaks located at the points @xmath112 and @xmath113 in this cluster is less than the conditional probability to find one maxima in between these points with height above @xmath43 . in out case",
    "this threshold is @xmath114 and @xmath115    however , this cluster is not a unique feature of the @xmath0 ring .",
    "there are two clusters of maxima ( see fig.[f4 ] ) , namely the cluster c9 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 and the cluster c11 with @xmath119 , and @xmath120 . here",

    "however , these peculiarities are not so specific . to show that `` over - clustering '' of the cmb sky is a typical feature of the signal",
    "let us examine , for example , the ring with @xmath123 , located symmetrically to the @xmath0 ring in respect to the galactic plane . in fig.[ff5a ] we show @xmath124 , and the distribution of clusters versus their length for the ring with @xmath125 .",
    "this signal reveals a remarkable similarity of the morphology to the ring @xmath0 . as for the ring with cs ,",
    "the ring @xmath125 is characterized by very high level of clusterisation , the existence of the @xmath126 minima , as a member of the cluster with @xmath127 , and the existence of the positive cluster with @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , one can see that the cluster of maxima c7 at @xmath129 has a structure similar to the structure of the signal in the cs , but now for the maxima .    at the end of this section we would like to point out that the existence of clusters with the length @xmath130 is a quite rare event for the grf .",
    "the presence of three clusters with @xmath131 for single iso - latitude ring at @xmath125 , and two clusters with @xmath132 for @xmath0 , as the cs as well , allow us to conclude that the ilc iii and wcm maps are generally `` over - clustered '' .",
    "attention on the cs was focused mainly because of the _ amplitude _ of the signal in that position .",
    "a more specific feature of the cs is not this , but that it is really a cluster of peaks with nearly the same amplitude , and there is a very large cluster near to it .",
    "= 0.8 = 0.8",
    "in this section we re - examine an idea of cruz et al ( 2007a ) , that the origin of the cs can be explained if the wmap cmb signal contains non - gaussian components in combination with the gaussian ones .",
    "this idea seems to be quite natural since the low multipole part of the wmap ilc iii map reveals significant peculiarities of the signal : alignment between quadrupole and octupole , coupling with the galactic foregrounds , low power of the quadrupole , and so on .",
    "note that the wmap team performed the analysis of gaussianity of the cmb signal by subtracting the ten multipole components of lowest order from the map and claimed that the rest of the signal is in agreement with gaussian statistics",

    "( 2004 ) , the existence of the cs and another peculiarities , mentioned in lasenby et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and mcewen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , raise the question of whether there is some mark imprint non - gaussian features of the cmb , mainly localised in the low multipole range of the power spectrum .",
    "if the wmap cmb outside the galactic mask @xmath133 is the sum of gaussian and non - gaussian components , it seems natural to guess that these two signals would have different characteristic scales .",
    "the idea , which we will develop below , is to use a linear filter of the cmb signal for each ring of the map with variable scale of filtration @xmath6 , which can divide the cmb signal in two parts : @xmath134 , where @xmath135 corresponds to gaussian component and @xmath136 corresponds to non - gaussian one .",

    "( 2007 ) use the wavelet approach to perform this analysis .",

    "= 0.8 = 0.8 = 0.8    = 0.45 = 0.45    however , from the middle plot of fig.[dem ] we can see that the cs , as well as all the large clusters come from the smoothed signal , which preserves all the non - gaussian features mentioned in the previous section including the cs . the bottom plot of fig.[dem ] show one more significant peculiarity of the cs zone . just at the edge of the cs",

    "this question seems to be one of the most important question of the entire analysis of the origin of the cs .",
    "do we have the only one single peculiar zone in the cmb map , or are there more zones with non - gaussian properties of the signal  ? to answer this question , we suggest using the distribution of the variance of the cmb signal versus the latitude , shown in fig.5 .",

    "we can see the following coordinates of the points of maxima : @xmath147 . for these rings we performed the same analysis as for the ring at @xmath0 .",

    "let us look closely at the skewness and kurtosis for that ring and find out the characteristic scale of non - gaussianity .",
    "what is interesting is that for the @xmath125 ring the skewness and kurtosis shown in fig.[dem57 ] are very close to the gaussian characteristics , while for the zone @xmath156 with clusters @xmath157 and @xmath158 we can clearly see two minima for the demodulated signal , one at @xmath159 and another at @xmath155 .",
    "= 0.8 = 0.8    = .8 = 0.8    = 0.8 = 0.8    however , we stress that for the whole ring at @xmath125 even without filtering , the skewness and kurtosis are close to the grf , unlike , for example @xmath0 ring .",

    "the wavelet approach gives us the azimuthal coordinate of the non - gaussian spot @xmath164 . from the top",
    "left plot , we can see that this point corresponds to a relatively small negative peak .",
    "the same morphology of the peaks is clearly observed at @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "both peaks are very similar to the cs zone , but with smaller amplitudes .",
    "these two peaks probably contribute to the overall non - gaussianity of the signal more significantly than the @xmath164 peak ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the next zone , which was not detected by cluster analysis at @xmath105 , is zone 7 shown on the top right plot . according to the wavelet analysis ,",
    "the azimuthal coordinate for this zone is @xmath167 . once again",
    ", here we have a negative peak , but the peak at @xmath168 reveals a more significant departure from gaussianity , it being a member of the cluster with number of minima @xmath169 .    for zone 8 ,",
    "the wavelets analysis gives us @xmath170 .",
    "we show the corresponding ring in fig.[fcf ] ( second from the top left plot ) .",
    "the detected zones manifest themselves as points of maxima , while the negative peaks detected by cluster analysis , listed in table1 reveal significant departure from gaussianity .",
    "for example , the cluster of minima at @xmath171 can be detected not only for @xmath105 threshold , but even for @xmath109 , as a cluster of maxima and minima .",
    "roughly speaking , all the pictures , shown in fig.[fcf ] clearly demonstrate that implementation of cluster analysis with different thresholds @xmath43 allow us to detect not only single non - gaussian zones , but also clusters of these zones which have non - local structure . to illustrate this tendency",
    ", we would like to draw attention to the bottom right picture belonging to the zone 18 . according to table1",
    ", the non - gaussian zone is located at @xmath172 being the member of the cluster and detected both by wavelet and by cluster analysis .",
    "however , there is another zone at @xmath173 with a morphology similar to the morphology of the cs .",
    "moreover , looking at the shape of the signal at @xmath174 one can see the modulation of the signal by low frequency harmonics .",
    "this type of non - gaussianity is an argument in favor of hypothesis that low multipoles of the cmb signal are highly non - gaussian .",
    "we have re - examined the properties of the internal linear combination wmap cmb map and the co - added wcm map by an analysis of the properties of the signal in the vicinity of the cs .",
    "these two maps of the cmb signal display remarkably similar structures on equal latitude rings at @xmath2 .",
    "we have re - examined the properties of the cs at the galactic latitude @xmath0 and longitude @xmath1 and shown that it is associated with the cluster with length @xmath175 .",
    "in addition to the cs , we have also found a few more zones of the cmb signal with almost the same morphology , at @xmath125 , @xmath176 , @xmath154 .    from an analysis of the ilc iii map",
    "we have shown that the shape of the cs is formed primarily by the cmb signal localized in multipoles between @xmath177 ( corresponding to angular scales about @xmath8 ) , in agreement with cruz et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2007 ) results . taking into account that the same modes lead to a modulation of the whole cmb sky , we subtracted these modes from the cmb signal .",
    "the demodulated cmb signal looks like a random one without significant over - clustering .",
    "we have investigated the asymmetry of the variance for iso - latitude rings in respect to the galactic plane .",
    "the south hemisphere has excess variance in comparison to the north hemisphere .",
    "this is why local defects and large clusters , including the cs and its associated cluster , are mainly concentrated in the southern hemisphere .",
    "taking all these investigations together , we believe that the mystery of the wmap cs directly reflects directly the peculiarities of the low - multipole tail of the cmb signal , rather than a single local ( isolated ) defect or a manifestation of a globally anisotropic model . this interpretation does not preclude the possibility of an exotic origin of the cs and related phenomena , but it does specify more precisely what properties such explanations must generate .",
    "a satisfactory model of the cs must explain the entire range of its behaviour rather than only one aspect .",
    "our final remark is related to the definition of significance of the cs detection by different methods , based on the assumption that gaussian statistics apply to the observed cmb sky .",
    "ever since eriksen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , showed that the distribution of the power of the cmb across the sky is very anisotropic at the scales about @xmath10 , it has been clear that gaussian statistics are no longer a valid reference for determining the significance of this feature .",
    "our approach to the large - scale angular modulation of the cmb is a possible alternative approach to this issue .",
    "we acknowledge the use of the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) .",
    "we also acknowledge the use of package ( grski et al . 2005 ) to produce @xmath53 .",
    "the package ( doroshkevich et al . 2005 ) was used in this work ."
