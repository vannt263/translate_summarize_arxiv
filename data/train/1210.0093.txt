    "+ in the case of low contact resistances the spin transport is influenced both at the injector and at the detector electrodes .",
    "when diffusing through the channel the low resistive detector has a high probability of detecting the spins as soon as they are near the contact as it acts as a spin sink ( fig .  [",
    "fig : figi ] ( b ) ) . therefore the effective traveling time",
    "is reduced and the measured diffusion coefficient enhanced as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the diffusion time for the length @xmath11 . at the same time",
