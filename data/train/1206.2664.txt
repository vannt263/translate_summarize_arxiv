    "negative differential conductance ( ndc ) is a fundamental property of two terminal devices since the discovery of the first tunnel diode @xcite .",
    "the realization of ndc within an atomic scale device @xcite can consequently be regarded as a milestone in the process of miniaturization which drives the information technology .",
    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments have played an important role in this research field giving several examples of ndc observed with a variety of nanojunctions .",
    "a number of physical scenarios have been proposed for the explanation of the experimental findings : among others the existence of sharp resonances on both electrodes @xcite , the voltage dependent increase in the tunneling barrier height @xcite , the orbital matching between molecule and tip @xcite or even just the symmetry matching between surface states in the substrate and molecular states @xcite .",
    "last but not least vibrational mediated ndc has also been observed in single molecule devices @xcite and proposed to test position dependent franck - condon factors in suspended carbon nanotubes @xcite .    recently also interference phenomena in single molecule junctions have attracted intense theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigations . these junctions allow to tackle the fundamental question of the quantum mechanical nature of the electronic transport at the nanoscale and exhibit dramatic modulations of the current desirable for applications .",
    "the quest of specific fingerprints of the electronic interference which go beyond the bare current or conductance suppression @xcite remains , though , a crucial issue .",
    "we establish in this article a criterion to identify the interference blocking scenario by correlating the spectral and the topographical information achievable in an stm single molecule measurement .    in a recent publication",
    "we have predicted the occurrence of ndc due to interference blocking @xcite in an stm single benzene junction on thin insulating film@xcite .",
    "benzene , however is not easily accessible in stm experiments and it is not obvious to which extent the findings of [ ] apply to larger , experimentally relevant molecules , see _ e.g. _ [ ] . a major result of this article is an analytical expression for the current as a function of the applied bias voltage encompassing various transport regimes , see eq . and , which provides both the criteria for the occurrence of interference blocking ndc and the interpretation of its topographical fingerprints .",
    "specifically , interference ndc is expected to occur in molecules which exhibit an electron affinity ( ionization potential ) @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) very close to the work function @xmath2 of the substrate and , due to their rotational symmetry , have an orbitally degenerate anion ( cation ) many - body eigenstate ( here @xmath3 , @xmath4 denote the many - body ground state energy of the neutral molecule and of the anion or cation ) .",
    "the necessary decoupling from the substrate , originally obtained through a thin insulating layer @xcite , can also be achieved by combining two different molecules in a monolayer directly adsorbed on a metal surface @xcite .",
    "recently , this set - up has been used to demonstrate position dependent local gating @xcite , thus suggesting an alternative possibility to achieve the mentioned interference conditions .",
    "topographical fingerprints to identify the interference blocking scenario are predicted both for the constant height and constant current scanning modes .",
    "interference is associated in the first case to a flattening of the current map in the molecule region with a corresponding loss of the characteristic nodal plane pattern ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : current_maps ] ) ; in the second case to an enhanced sensitivity of the apparent height of the molecule to the operating current ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : height_cuts ] ) . as we will prove later , both phenomena have the same origin _",
    "i.e. _ , in the interference blocking regime , the bottleneck process defining the current pattern is a _ substrate _ and not a tip tunneling event .",
    "the analytical results apply to a wide class of molecular junctions . in particular , we present simulations concerning a cupc junction .",
    "we describe the stm single molecule junction as a system - bath model : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian for the isolated molecule , in which , to fix the ideas , we distinguish a single particle component @xmath7 and a two particle component @xmath8 , both expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath9 for the atomic orbitals @xmath10 where @xmath11 indicates both the site and the atomic species . @xmath12 and @xmath13 account for the substrate and the tip , respectively , which we assume as reservoirs of non interacting electrons with different spatial confinement .",
    "finally @xmath14 describes the tunneling coupling between the metallic leads and the molecule : @xmath15 where @xmath16 indicates the substrate or the tip , @xmath17 the momentum and @xmath18 the spin of the electron in the lead .",
    "due to their rotational symmetry , the molecular orbitals are classified using the projection @xmath19 of the angular momentum along the principal rotation axis of the molecule .",
    "a further quantum number @xmath20 is introduced to account for possible degeneracies in the spectrum of the angular momentum . finally , the tunneling amplitudes @xmath21 take the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the energy eigenvalue of the single particle hamiltonian @xmath7 associated to the state @xmath24 . for the substrate and tip states we assume the model described in [ ] :",
    "a three dimensional momentum is necessary for the extended substrate states while only the momentum in the transport direction characterizes the tip states which are confined in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 direction around the tip position .    .",
    "our method of choice to treat the dynamics in the regime of weak coupling between system and leads is the liouville equation method .",
    "we start from the liouville equation for the total density operator @xmath27 of the whole system consisting of the molecule , the tip and the substrate .",
    "we focus on the time evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath28 , formally obtained by taking the trace over the unobserved degrees of freedom of the tip and the substrate . a detailed discussion and derivation of the equation of motion for the reduced density operator of the system can be found _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite and in @xcite its adaptation to the stm set - up on thin insulating films . for a general discussion about the reduced density matrix and related equations of motion see also @xcite    let us now consider a molecule deposited on a substrate having a non degenerate neutral ground state @xmath29 and an orbitally degenerate anion ground state @xmath30 .",

    "the rate matrices acquire the form : @xmath50 where we did not write for simplicity the energy dependence of @xmath51 and the energy and tip position dependence of @xmath52 and of the phase @xmath53 .",

    "the basis transformation , within each spin sector of the anionic ground state , reads @xmath55 and it depends on the position of the tip via the phase @xmath53 . due to the diagonal form of the rate matrices , in this basis",

    "[ fig : iv_stability ] we report the iv characteristics calculated for a cu - phthalocyanine on a metal - insulator substrate ( a 7  thick insulator with relative dielectric constant @xmath70 ) with an effective work function @xmath71 .",
    "we set up the single particle hamiltonian for the molecule in the tight binding approximation and calculate the hopping terms following the slater - koster scheme @xcite .",
    "moreover , we adopt the constant interaction approximation and assume a charging energy that fits the experimentally evaluated electron affinity @xmath0 of cupc of @xmath72 .    at low bias",
    "the current is suppressed by coulomb blockade . as the bias increases on the positive side ( conventionally under this condition electrons flow from the tip to the substrate ) the current undergoes a sudden jump corresponding to the opening of the neutral - anion transition at the tip - molecule interface ( @xmath73 ) . on the negative bias side the coulomb blockade",
    "is also lifted , but this time at the substrate resonance point ( @xmath74 ) and the current shows a sharp peak whose width scales with the temperature ( @xmath75 in all presented plots ) . at higher negative biases the current",
    "is blocked due to interference and the decoupled anionic state is the sink of the system .",
    "a crucial condition for the interference blocking to occur is that @xmath76 , ensuring that the substrate - molecule anion resonance anticipates the tip - molecule cation one which would otherwise dominate the transport characteristics .",
    "analogous interference blocking involving degenerate manybody states has been encountered in a variety of systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the stm set up described here uniquely allows to correlate the interference current blocking with specific topographical fingerprints . in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_maps ] we present different constant height current maps ( the tip is positioned always 7  above the molecular plane ) corresponding to the different points labeled in the right panel of fig .",

    "striking is the flattening of the current map obtained in the interference case ( map 4 ) if compared to all other regimes .",
    "signatures of interference can be clearly seen also in the current vs. tip - molecule distance represented in fig .",

    "the four traces correspond to the four different biases conditions indicated with the numbers @xmath77 to @xmath78 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iv_stability ] and the tip is in the same @xmath79 position . at large tip - molecule distances all traces show the exponentially decaying behaviour typical of the stm measurements ( roughly 1 order of magnitude decay per  ) . at shorter distances , all curves saturates due to the form of the @xmath80 orbitals .",
    "contrary to the others , though , the curve corresponding to the interference blockade regime ( case 4 ) saturates at larger distances and shows a wide plateau .",
    "for this reason it even crosses the coulomb blockade trace ( case 2 ) at @xmath81 , consistently with the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : iv_stability ] .    finally , we also present in fig .",
    "[ fig : height_cuts ] several constant current topographic maps simulated for different biases and different working currents .",
    "the surfaces presented in the upper panel correspond to the coulomb blockade regime , while the ones in the lower panel to the interference blockade . due to the particular choice of the biases ,",
    "the apparent height of the molecule is exactly the same if we choose 3 pa as a working current .",
    "the shape of the molecule is not modified in the interference blockade regime , as it is for the constant height current maps ( see fig.[fig : current_maps ] ) . yet , striking it is , in this regime , the enhanced sensitivity of the apparent height of the molecule with respect to the variation of the working current , if compared with the same measurement in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the surfaces presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : height_cuts ] correspond in fact , for both cases , to working currents in the range 2.85 - 3.15 pa .",
    "all the results presented in the previous section can be understood by analyzing the different limits of eq .  .",
    "let us first consider the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the latter is defined , for @xmath82 , by the inequality @xmath83 which in turn implies @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in this limit and under the asymmetry relation",
    "@xmath86 typical of an stm experiment , it is not difficult to prove that    @xmath87    the current is thus proportional to the tip rate . the equality in eq .",
    "has also a precise physical interpretation .",
    "the charge fluctuations at the substrate lead represent the fastest phenomenon ( @xmath88 due to the asymmetric potential drop at tip - molecule and substrate - molecule contacts ) which sets the ratio between the populations of the states to be the thermal average , @xmath89 .",
    "finally , the trace sum rule implies :    @xmath90    the current is determined instead by the slowest process : the tunnelling event @xmath91 towards the tip .",
    "equation follows due to the presence of @xmath92 spin channels and that the tip rate for the coupled state is @xmath93 .",
    "analogously , for @xmath94 , the coulomb blockade condition reads @xmath95 and the current is again proportional to the tip rate , namely @xmath96 .",
    "thus , the constant height current map reproduces the shape of the moelcular orbital encoded in @xmath52 .",
    "the interference blockade regime is confined to the negative bias and it is defined by the inequality @xmath97 which implies @xmath98 and @xmath99 . under these conditions",
    "the current , eq .   , reduces to    @xmath100    equation tells us , even more clearly if cast into the form @xmath101 , that the current is the result of two competing processes happening _ in series _ : the thermal unblocking of the decoupled state @xmath102 towards the substrate and the tip tunnelling event @xmath103 . notice",
    "that in the system dynamics the two tunnelling events are not independent : one can not happen if the other did not happen before . in the interference blocking regime @xmath104 , but , in an stm set up , it typically also holds @xmath86 . to fix the ideas",
    "let us first fix the tip position ( thus , the ratio @xmath105 ) and lower the bias , deep in the interference blockade , such to fulfill the condition @xmath106 .",
    "the current is thus proportional to @xmath51 and independent of the tip position .",
    "this fact explains the flattening of the constant height currnet map in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_maps ] and the wide plateau of the current versus tip molecule distance in fig .",
    "[ fig : current_z ] . nevertheless , as the tip moves far of the molecule , the tip rate drops and , as the condition @xmath107 is fulfilled , the position dependence of the current is recovered ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the cross over between the two regimes is estimated by the relation : @xmath109 with @xmath110 . for completeness",
    "we add that the interference blockade is the only regime in which the current looses its canonical dependence on the tip position : the current saturates in fact to @xmath111 for large positive biases , it is @xmath112 at the tip - molecule resonance and @xmath113 at the substrate - molecule resonance .",
    "the summary of these results and their extension to the work function and bias voltage plane is presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : iv_stability ] where the letters t and s indicate regions where the current is proportional respectively to the tip or substrate rate .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity of the apparent molecular height to the value of the working current of a constant current scan performed in the interference blocking regime can also be explained by analyzing eqs . and .",
    "let us consider a certain value for the working current @xmath114 .",
    "starting from eqs .",
    "and we can extract the equations for the constant current isosurfaces :    @xmath115    respectively for the coulomb blockade and interference blockade regimes .",
    "if , for a given choice of the parameters @xmath114 and @xmath116 , it holds @xmath117 the two associated contant current isosurfaces coincide .",
    "this is indeed , by construction , the case for the bias corresponding to the points @xmath92 and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig : iv_stability ] if the working current is chosen exactly as the one in the iv characteristics .",
    "nevertheless , for the same choice of the biases , very different sensitivity of the constant current isosurface to the value of the working current is shown in the interference blockade and in the coulomb blockade cases ( compare upper to lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : height_cuts ] ) . by analyzing the second equation in",
    "we can see that @xmath118 diverges for @xmath114 in the vicinity of the interference current @xmath119 while @xmath120 shows a completely regular behaviour .",
    "as @xmath121 the corresponding isosurface shrinks rapidly as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : height_cuts ]",
    ". moreover , the interference current also represents in the vicinity of the interference blockade regime , an upper limit for the working current accessible to a constant current stm scan .",
    "in fact , for @xmath122 the constant @xmath118 turns negative and the second equation in can not be fulfilled for whatever position of the tip .",
    "special consideration should be given to the robustness of the presented effect .",
    "indeed we have presented so far the idealized situation in which the rotational symmetry of the cupc is assumed to be unperturbed with a consequently perfect degeneracy of the anion ground states .",
    "nevertheless this perfect degeneracy is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of the many - body interference effect described in the manuscript . as we have already explicitly shown in a previous publication @xcite the interference blocking scenario persists as far as the quasi - degeneracy is present _",
    "i.e. _ the splitting of the interfering energy levels is smaller than the tunneling coupling .",
    "in fact , if the tunneling coupling is strong enough , the indetermination principle does not allow to distinguish between the two quasi - degenerate states in the tunneling event and interference takes place .",
    "moreover , since the tip tunneling coupling is controlled , in an stm experiment , by the tip position , the interference between quasi - degenerate states could be controlled by the tip position .",
    "the result would be the tuning , with the tip - molecule distance , of the negative differential conductance at negative bias voltages associated to the interference blocking .",
    "finally , for what concerns the effect of the substrate on the molecular symmetry we would like to mention that strong experimental sensitivity to molecular symmetry has been proven for derivatives of cupc molecules on thin insulating films ( see sonnleitner et al . [ ] ) suggesting that an almost complete decoupling of the molecular states is indeed a good approximation for these systems .",
    "finally , the results presented so far for the cupc apply in general to the class of planar molecules belonging to the @xmath123 symmetry group , i.e. invariant under the set of rotations of angles @xmath124 around a principal rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and to a set of @xmath125 vertical planes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : set - up ] ) . their many body - states , like the single particle ones , can be classified using the projection @xmath19 of the angular momentum in the direction of the main rotational axis ( conventionally the @xmath126 axis ) that we introduced in eq .  .",
    "the generic many body eigenstates of @xmath127 can thus be written in the form @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the particle number , @xmath130 the energy , @xmath131 and @xmath19 respectively the projections of the total spin and of the angular momentum in the @xmath126 direction in units of @xmath132 .",
    "the state @xmath128 transforms under a rotation of an angle @xmath133 around the main rotation axis as : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the rotation operator .",
    "consequently it is not difficult to prove that @xmath19 is an integer number and @xmath136 for @xmath123 molecules with even @xmath125 and @xmath137 when @xmath125 is odd .",
    "since @xmath138 admits at maximum bidimensional irreducible representations , we conclude that the states with opposite @xmath19 , connected by the reflection operation through the @xmath125 vertical planes , have symmetry protected degeneracy and only states with @xmath139 ( for even or odd @xmath125 ) or @xmath140 ( for even @xmath125 ) are non degenerate .",
    "by studying the transport characteristics of an stm single molecule junction on a thin insulating film we identify in this article a class of molecules that should present strong ndc and interference blocking features .",
    "moreover we establish a criterion to identify the interference blocking scenario based on topographical fingerprints .",
    "in particular , for biases in the vicinity of the interference blocking regime , a flattening of the molecular image in constant height and an enhanced sensitivity of the apparent height to the working current in the constant current mode are expected .",
    "the robustness of the effect is ensured by the observation that quasi - degeneracy and not exact degeneracy of the interfering many - body states is the necessary condition for the persistence of the phenomenon .",
