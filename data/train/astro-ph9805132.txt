    "the theory of particle acceleration in pulsar magnetospheres has been under development for almost three decades .",
    "although it was well known that rotating magnetic dipoles would induce electric fields in vacuum ( deutsch 1955 ) , it took several years after the discovery of pulsars to realize that the huge vacuum fields could not in practice be available for particle acceleration .",
    "the electric field parallel to the magnetic field is at least partly screened by particles supplied from the stellar surface ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) or by electron - positron avalanches ( sturrock 1971 ) . the true accelerating voltage of a pulsar must be determined by departures from the corotation , or goldreich - julian charge density , that could completely screen the parallel electric field .",
    "several types of models have studied pulsar acceleration due to charge deficits at different locations in the magnetosphere .",
    "polar cap ( pc ) models consider the formation of a parallel electric field in the open field region near the magnetic poles , while outer gap models consider accceleration in the outer magnetosphere , near the null charge surface ( see mestel 1998 for the most recent and comprehensive review of pulsar electrodynamics ) .",
    "ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ; hereafter rs75 ) introduced a pc model invoking a vacuum gap due to the trapping of ions in the neutron star ( ns ) crust .",
    "the calculations by jones ( 1985 , 1986 ) , and neuhauser et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1987 ) seem to favor a low value for the work function ( at least a factor of 10 less than it was thought earlier ) in the ns surface with a strong magnetic field . the important implication of this study is that the possibility of free ejection of charges ( actually of both signs ) from the ns surface can be now , at least theoretically , justified . in this paper , we concentrate on a space - charge limited flow model ( implying very low work function in the ns surface ) based originally on the work of arons & scharlemann ( 1979 ; hereafter as79 ) , who determined the electric field produced by the small deparature from the goldreich - julian charge that grows above the surface due to the geometry of the open dipole field .",
    "the electric field accelerating electrons in this model developed along only field lines that curved toward the rotation axis (  favorably \" curved field lines ) , so that acceleration occurred over half of the pc .",
    "the parallel field is shorted - out at a height above the surface where the @xmath0-rays from accelerated particles produce sufficient electron - positron pairs in the strong magnetic field .",
    "the accelerating potential is thus limited by such a pair formation front ( pff ) .",
    "these initial calculations of electron - positron pffs assumed that the primary electrons began accelerating at the ns surface and that curvature radiation ( cr ) was the only mechanism for providing pair - producing photons ( arons 1983 ; hereafter a83 ) . in recent years , it has become clear that inverse - compton scattering ( ics ) of soft thermal x - ray photons from the hot ns surface by the primary electrons is also an important mechanism above the pc . as well as being a significant energy loss ( kardashv et al .",
    "1984 , xia et al . 1985 , daugherty & harding 1989 , sturner 1995 ; hereafter s95 ) and radiation ( sturner & dermer 1994 ) mechanism , ics can also provide photons capable of producing pairs .",
    "pulsed x - rays have been detected from a number of pulsars which are consistent with blackbody spectra at temperatures around @xmath2 k ( ogelman 1995 ) .",
    "zhang & qiao ( 1996 ) and zhang et al . ( 1997 ; hereafter zqlh97 ) first explored the effect of the pairs from inverse - compton photons on the acceleration in a ruderman - sutherland type model .",
    "they found that ics photons may produce a pff sooner ( at a lower altitude ) than the cr photons would from the same accelerating electrons .",
    "in fact in this case , the electrons will stop accelerating before they can emit significant cr .",
    "the standard models of pc acceleration thus need substantial revision .",
    "another effect which has never been included in pc acceleration models is the formation of a lower pff due to the positrons that are turned around and accelerated downward from the electron pff .",
    "although the number of positrons which are accelerated downward is small compared to the number of primary electrons and even to the charge deficit near the upper pff , the multiplicity of the downward cascades is quite large ( as we will discuss in section 3.1 ) .",
    "thus , the amount of charge produced by only a small number of downward moving positrons may be sufficient to establish a second pff . although downward going cascades have been discussed in previous papers ( see e.g. as79 ) , their effect on the acceleration of primaries has not been investigated .",
    "daugherty & harding ( 1996 , hereafter dh96 ) qualitatively discussed the effects of pair cascades by returning positrons , their creation of pairs within the acceleration zone and the need for a self - consistent model of pc acceleration .    in this paper , we present a detailed study of the acceleration of primary electrons and secondary ( downward - moving ) positrons above a pulsar pc , assuming space - charge limited flow ( free emission ) of particles from the ns surface ( see harding & muslimov 1998 , for a review ) . we include the general relativistic effect of inertial frame - dragging , which induces a much larger electric field than that expected in the flat spacetime and is not limited to favorably - curved field lines ( section [ sec : ell ] ) .",
    "this is important because , as has been concluded earlier in papers by fawley , arons & scharlemann ( 1977 ) and a83 , the potential drops ( derived for flat space - time ) are not sufficient to account for oberved pulsar @xmath0-rays .",
    "both electrons and positrons suffer energy loss and emit photons from cr and ics .",
    "the treatment of ics of both upward and downward moving particles requires revisions from previous studies of only upward moving particles ( dermer 1990 ; hereafter d90 ; s95 ) , which are presented in section [ sec : ic ] .",
    "we then compute the location of both electron and positron pffs due to one - photon pair production as a function of magnetic colatitude and height of the lower pff .",
    "we also discuss in section [ sec : pfraction ] the fraction of positrons that are turned around at the upper pff .",
    "when the electrons are assumed to accelerate from the ns surface , we find that ics photons produce the pffs ( section 3.1 ) , in agreement with the results of zqlh97 .",
    "however , we also find that there is substantial difference between the scattering of upward - going electrons and downward - going positrons by the same thermal x - ray photons : the electrons scatter these photons at angles less than @xmath3 , while the positrons scatter the photons head - on .",
    "electrons produce pairs through resonant scattering , while positrons produce pairs by scattering above the cyclotron resonance .",
    "the photons scattered by positrons are therefore more energetic and produce pairs in a shorter distance .",
    "these pairs may screen the accelerating field up to some distance above the surface .",
    "we find that stable , double pffs can form only when cr photons produce them , i.e. at a height where cr losses overtake ics losses .",
    "we compute the height of these stable pffs as a function of pulsar period and surface field strength ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "one interesting result is that the acceleration voltage limited by cr - controlled pffs is only a function of magnetic colatitude ( i.e. geometry of the open field lines ) , ranging between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and is insensitive to pulsar parameters such as period and surface value of the magnetic field strength and even to the height of the acceleration .",
    "the stable location of the lower pff depends primarily on surface magnetic field , temperature and size of the hot polar cap , ranging between 0.5 and 1.0 stellar radius , but is insensitive to period",
    ". implications of these results for high - energy pulsar emission are discussed in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "we consider a test particle approach to the determination of pff locations .",
    "the test particles in this case are electrons or positrons that gain energy through electrostatic acceleration and lose energy through radiative losses .",
    "photons are created by cr and ics and destroyed by magnetic pair creation .",
    "we assume that the electric field is completely screened at the point where the first pair is produced .",
    "this is a good assumption for several reasons .",
    "first , as discussed in more detail below , the electric field arises due to a small imbalance between the actual charge density and the local , rotation - induced , goldreich - julian charge density .",
    "it therefore does not require much additional charge to short - out this field .",
    "second , the onset of pair cascading occurs very quickly ( dh96 ) , so that the number of pairs produced per primary particle increases rapidly over small distances .",
    "thus , as found in a83 , the width of the pff ( the screening distance of the electric field ) is very small compared to other dimensions of the problem .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the geometry of the calculation .",
    "suppose that the pff results from pairs produced by @xmath0-rays of energy @xmath6 ( in units of @xmath7 ) radiated by particles of energy @xmath8 .",
    "the distance of the pff from the starting point of the particle acceleration at @xmath9 is then : [ sc ] s_c = min[s_a(_min ) + s_p(_min ) ] where @xmath10 is the distance required to accelerate the particle until it can radiate a photon of energy @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the pair attenuation length of the photon .",
    "the acceleration distance , @xmath10 , is determined by first integrating the equation of motion of the particle to determine its energy as a function of its pathlength @xmath13 : [ dgamma ] cdds = emce _ - _ _ ic - _ _ cr , where @xmath14 is the electric field induced parallel to the magnetic field , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the loss rates for ics and cr .",
    "discussion of these processes will be given in sections [ sec : ell ] and [ sec : rloss ] .",
    "the pair production attenuation length of photons radiated by the particle through either ics or cr is then determined .",
    "this attenuation length @xmath17 , defined to be the path length over which the optical depth is unity , is given by [ tau ] ( ) = _ 0^s_p ( ) t_pp(_kb , ) ds = 1 , where is the pathlength differential along the photon momentum vector , @xmath18 is the attenuation coefficient for one - photon pair production and @xmath19 is the angle between and the local magnetic field direction .",
    "computation of @xmath17 will be discussed in section [ sec : pair ] . as we will discuss in section [ sec : numres ] , when ics causes the pff@xmath20 and pff@xmath21 , @xmath22 is smaller than @xmath23 , due to different modes of ics .",
    "the pff@xmath20 will then not coincide with the start of the electron acceleration at @xmath9 .",
    "we use the electric field due to inertial frame dragging above the ns surface , first calculated by muslimov & tsygan ( 1990 , 1992 ; hereafter mt90 , 92 ) .",
    "the regime under which the generation of this field occurs is actually the same as implied in the electric field computations in flat spacetime by as79 , that of space - charge limited flow .",
    "an electric field must be present above the ns surface because as charges flow along open magnetic field lines , the corotation , or goldreich - julian charge density @xmath24 , can not be maintained .",
    "even though @xmath25 and therefore @xmath26 at the surface , the curvature of the field lines causes the area of the open field region , through which the particles flow , to increase faster than @xmath24 , and a charge deficit grows with distance .",
    "thus , the @xmath14 grows with height up to about one stellar radius above the surface , and then drops off .",
    "it is important that for a nearly aligned ns in flat spacetime , the space - charge density of the outflowing particles ( electrons ) proved to be almost exactly compensated by the effective goldreich - julian charge density , thus resulting in the substantial suppression of the electric field in the region of open field lines .",
    "general relativity causes a significant modification of the mechanism of the electric field induction , through the effect of dragging of inertial frames , a consequence of the distortion of spacetime by a rotating gravitating body .",
    "an observer near a rotating mass experiences a force and must corotate to remain in an inertial frame , with an angular velocity that decreases with distance from the rotating mass .",
    "the charge density above a ns surface must be computed in a local inertial frame that is rotating with respect both to the ns and to an observer at infinity .",
    "thus the goldreich - julian charge density , which is the charge density required to make magnetospheric particles drift in corotation with the star , will differ from that in flat spacetime .",
    "this charge difference enhances @xmath14 over what it would be in flat spacetime , by a factor of 50 - 100 for a typical 1 s pulsar . the frame - dragging contribution to @xmath14 that signifies the striking difference between the general relativistic and classical treatments of ns electrodynamics is proportional to @xmath27 ( see equation [ [ ell_1 ] ] below ) , where @xmath28 is the angle between the magnetic and spin axes of the pulsar .",
    "[ obviously , there is also a frame - dragging contribution to @xmath14 which is proportional to @xmath29 , but it is comparable to that produced in a flat spacetime limit . ]",
    "particle acceleration may therefore occur throughout the entire open field line region , with the relative contribution of the frame dragging component to @xmath14 being strongest for pulsars with small obliquities .",
    "muslimov & harding ( 1997 ; hereafter mh97 ) derived expressions for the @xmath14 due to frame dragging in two limits : close enough to the ns surface such that @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the pc half - angle , and far from the surface such that @xmath32 .",
    "these expressions were derived from solutions to poisson s equations assuming boundary conditions @xmath26 , as well as the potential @xmath33 at the stellar surface and along the last open field line . we have adapted these solutions for use in this paper by incorporating the screening effect of an upper boundary at @xmath34 , i.e. of the pair formation front , where @xmath35 .",
    "although this approach is not fully self - consistent , in section 2.1.1 we discuss how the screening of the electric field at the upper boundary could be included in our calculations in a self - consistent way . in this paper",
    "we also explore the situation where the positrons flowing back to the pc surface initiate electron - positron cascades .",
    "although this possibility has been discussed since the very first papers on pulsar electrodynamics ( see e.g. as79 ) , it has never been addressed at an appropriate quantitative level . here",
    "we attempt to approach this and some other related problems from the quantitative point of view which , we believe , can advance our understanding of the pc electrodynamics and its relevance to the modeling of @xmath36-ray emission from pulsars .",
    "we note that the derivation of formulae for the electric field ( potential ) we exploit in the present analysis implies that the angle @xmath31 ( magnetic colatitude of the polar field line ) is small , which is a very good approximation for the region of open magnetic field lines in most pulsars .",
    "however , it is instructive to look at the general - relativistic expression for the goldreich - julian charge density that contains a contribution of order of @xmath37 to the main term .",
    "this expression reads _",
    "gj = - b_0 f ( ) \\ { + 32 h ( ) } , where @xmath38 is the ns rotation frequency , @xmath39 is the surface value of the magnetic field strength at the magnetic pole , @xmath40 is the red - shift function , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the gravitational radius of the ns , r is the stellar radius , @xmath43 is the dimensionless radial coordinate , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the moment of inertia and mass of the ns , respectively , and the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined below ( see equations [ 8 ] , [ 16 ] ) . in formula ( 4 ) the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 should be evaluated at @xmath43 and @xmath51 . in our derivation of the general - relativistic electrodynamic equations we neglect the contribution to the electric field produced by the flaring of the magnetic field lines , which is a factor of @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the pulsar spin period ) smaller than that produced by the frame dragging .",
    "this contribution results from the second - order terms like that in the square bracket of equation [ 4 ] .",
    "[ in section 2.4 we will refer to this equation to clarify yet another important issue .",
    "] the small - angle approximation may not be accurate enough for the millisecond pulsars , for which @xmath54 .",
    "we also note that the effect of the electric field generation by the frame dragging does not depend on the particular configuration of the stellar magnetic field , simply because while the distribution of the real space charge in the acceleration region is mainly determined by the flaring of the magnetic field lines , the effect of frame dragging on the goldreich - julian charge density is independent of the geometry of the polar field lines .",
    "this means that one can not mimic the frame dragging effect simply by distorting the polar magnetic flux tube .",
    "the possibility of electron - positron cascades near the stellar surface initiated by the backflowing positrons unavoidably implies that the bottom of the polar magnetic flux tube should be treated as a highly - conducting layer of an electron - positron plasma on the top of the pc surface , rather than as a regular ns surface made of iron or hydrogen atoms in the strong magnetic field . in a more extreme case",
    "( see e.g. wang et al .",
    "1998 ) , which seems to be less justified at the moment , the whole ns surface may be covered by a thin electron - positron plasma layer .",
    "note that the presence of such a layer even on the top of the pc should substantially affect the electrodynamics and therefore the acceleration of charged particles in the region of open magnetic field lines .",
    "it will allow the free supply of charges into the acceleration region , a requirement for space - charge limited flow .",
    "also , we shall discuss in section 3 , a self - consistent regime with double pffs that may significantly differ from the standard one implying a single pff above the stellar surface .    in this section and",
    "the next , we discuss the principal modifications one must introduce into the treatment of the acceleration region to incorporate the effects resulting from the occurrence of double pffs .",
    "first of all , the appropriate distance variables in @xmath14 should be rescaled by an  effective \" ns radius @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "fig 1 ) , which is now assumed to be the lower boundary of the acceleration , such that @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the dimensionless altitude above the effective surface .",
    "the expressions for the electric field are thus symmetric between the lower and upper boundaries , in the sense that they allow the proper treatment of e.g. both primary electron and secondary positron acceleration , which is an essential requirement for the theory .    to clarify our analytic solutions ( see section 2.1.2 ) for the rescaled electric potential ( accelerating electric field ) produced between the lower and upper pair fronts , let us consider the expression for the electric potential in terms of the difference between the actual and goldreich - julian charge densities @xmath58 . because @xmath59 and @xmath24 are just linear combinations of @xmath29 and @xmath27 , we can write the potential @xmath60 in the simple form ( at distances from the stellar surface greater than the pc size ) as [ phi ] = s ( r ) ( 1-^2 ) , where @xmath61 ^ 2 $ ] is the cross - sectional area of the polar magnetic flux tube at the radial distance @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the coefficients of @xmath27 and @xmath29 in the expression for @xmath65 ( see equations  [ [ rho ] ] and [ [ rhogj ] ] )",
    ". it also says that the local value of the electric potential is of order of the local value of the effective space charge ( equal to the difference between the real space charge and induced goldreich - julian space charge ) divided by the characteristic longitudinal length scale .",
    "the expression ( [ phi ] ) does not incorporate the effect of the screening of the electric field at the upper boundary ( pff ) .",
    "this effect is included in the corresponding expressions we discuss later in section [ sec : epff ] . the relation ( [ phi ] )",
    "gives the correct solution for the electric potential and longitudinal component of the electric field for altitudes greater than the pc size and satisfying the @xmath33 and @xmath66 boundary conditions at the ( effective ) stellar surface , where @xmath67 .",
    "this expression is very useful for illustrating the modification of the potential and longitudinal component of the electric field resulted from the redefining of the position of the lower zero - electric field boundary ( set e.g. by the lower pff produced by the backflowing positrons ) .",
    "it explains the physical meaning of such a modification , which is simply a readjustment of the true charge outflow ( in the regime of self - limitation ) to the local value of the goldreich - julian charge density at the effective surface , and allows us to better understand the corresponding exact analytic solution .",
    "we introduce the radial coordinate scaled by effective radius @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and transverse coordinate @xmath70 , the magnetic colatitude scaled by the half - opening angle of the polar magnetic flux tube , ( ) = _ 0 ^ 1/2 at radius @xmath71 , where _ 0 = ^1/2 is the pc half - angle at the effective surface @xmath72 , and [ f ] f ( ) = -3()^3is the correction factor for the dipole component of the magnetic flux through the magnetic hemisphere of radius @xmath62 in a schwarzchild metric ( mh97 ) .",

    "soon after the concept of electron - positron pair production had been introduced into pulsar models ( sturrock 1971 ) , it became clear that the precipitation of positrons ( or , in some models , electrons ) onto the stellar surface may have some important effects .",
    "for example , sturrock has noticed that ( see p. 531 ) `` if the positrons were all returned to the surface , the resulting space charge would reverse the sign of the electric field at the surface , cutting off the flux of primary electrons '' .",
    "then he added that `` one possibility is that the configuration so adjusts itself that the primary flux is never quite cut off , so that the flow is steady , and another possibility is that the flow is oscillatory '' .",
    "thus , he drew attention to the existence of an intrinsic feedback between the pair formation and the electric field accelerating primary particles . later on ,",
    "several authors ( see e.g. rs75 , jones 1978 , as79 , and arons 1981 ) have discussed similar ideas focusing on the possibility of pc heating by the flow of energetic positrons ( electrons ) .",
    "dh96 discussed the effect of downward moving positrons on the particle acceleration and the possibility of a lower pff .",
    "the most detailed study has been performed by as79 who calculated the fraction of returning positrons , structure of the pff with positron trapping near but below the lower boundary of the pff , and briefly discussed the positron - initiated cascade very near the stellar surface .",
    "they estimated the fraction of returning positrons as @xmath180 ( @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the half - opening angle of the polar flux tube at the stellar surface ) of the goldreich - julian charge density . the main argument underlying",
    "this estimate is that the contribution of the second term in the square bracket in equation ( 4 ) increases with altitude ( due to the flaring of the magnetic field lines emanating from the pc ) , and that ( see as79 , p. 867 ) `` the additional negative charge density needed to achieve @xmath66 , over and above that of the electron beam , is therefore a fraction @xmath183 of the negative charge density already present in the electron stream '' . and , `` as the pairs begin to form near but below some height ( at which the electric field shuts off ) , the residual @xmath184 of the diode causes the secondary electron - positron plasma to polarize and shield these `` external '' charges .",
    "the formation of this polarization charge requires a dynamical response which , under most conditions , leads to the formation of the downward directed positron stream whose flux at the stellar surface is @xmath185 '' .",
    "however , the main problem with this reasoning is that if we assume the zero - electric field boundary condition at the stellar surface , then `` the additional negative charge density '' is nothing else but the imbalance between the real and goldreich - julian charge densities that produces the electric field above the stellar surface in the first place .",
    "this imbalance ( or charge deficit ) increases with altitude and reaches some maximum value .",
    "thus , if the backflowing positrons shield these `` external '' charges at some height , then they will also screen the electric field all the way down to the stellar surface , and we should unavoidably come up with the situation envisaged by sturrock , where the returning positrons cut off the flux of primary electrons , thus resulting in the oscillatory regime .    in this section ,",
    "we explore the possibility of occurrence of a steady regime of positron backflow that is not capable of disrupting the current of primary electrons .",
    "we also discuss the efficiency of pc heating produced by the precipitating relativistic positrons and high - energy quanta .",
    "we also discuss the accounting of the feedback between the returning positron flux and electric potential distribution in the acceleration region in the self - limiting regime of particle flow .",
    "the primary ( electron ) traversing the region of the electric potential drop emits a @xmath186ray photon that produces an electron - positron pair at the altitude @xmath187 above the stellar surface .",
    "the electron - positron pairs keep moving forward , with some positrons of these pairs decelerating and eventually reversing the direction of their motion at some altitude @xmath188 .",
    "it is very likely that the same effect tends to occur with the positrons from both additional photons emitted by the same electron or from a second generation of pairs .",
    "an accurate determination of the fraction of backflowing positrons would require a self - consistent calculation of the screening of @xmath184 by the cascade pairs and the modification of the pair energy and spatial distribution by the screened @xmath184 .",
    "short of carrying out such a detailed calculation here , we shall derive an upper limit on the fraction of returning positrons .",
    "however , since the cascades develop very fast and the number density of particles increases in an avalanche , the altitudes at which the positrons from the higher - order cascades get decelerated should be very close to but slightly above @xmath189 .",
    "the deceleration of positrons results in a charge separation in the initially quasi - neutral electron - positron beam , thus effectively shielding the electric field where the bulk of the pair front is produced .",
    "we can justifiably assume that @xmath66 at @xmath190 .",
    "the backflowing positrons slightly suppress the voltage all the way down to the bottom of the polar magnetic flux tube , so that the electric field @xmath184 ( and also potential @xmath191 ) vanishes at a height greater than the start - off height of the primary electrons .",
    "this occurs because the flux of backflowing positrons is equivalent to a corresponding enhancement of the total electron current and therefore of the maximum number of electrons per second to be ejected into the acceleration region .",
    "thus , in compliance with the zero - electric field boundary condition , the ejection radius should fix itself at the larger value corresponding to a higher effective `` rate of supply of goldreich - julian charge '' ( see also expressions [ 4 ] and [ [ ietae ] ] proving this statement ) .",
    "let us introduce the goldreich - julian current ( associated with the corresponding charge density ) or the rate of ejection of charges per element of the solid angle into the region of open magnetic field lines = c | _ gj | ( r)^2 , where @xmath192 , and @xmath193 is an element of the solid angle in the pc region . in the rest of this section we present our estimate of the maximum power carried by the backflowing positrons .",
    "using the general - relativistic expression for @xmath74 ( equation [ [ rhogj ] ] ) we can write [ ietae ] di_gj(__e ) = i_0 , where @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "the zero - electric field boundary condition at @xmath196 requires the magnitude of the primary electron current flowing from the pc surface to be equal to @xmath197 .",
    "this expression implies ( compare with expression [ 4 ] ) that an enhanced electron current is ejected from the effective radius in the regime of self - limitation or , equivalently , allows for the additional current of positrons flowing from the upper pff downward .",
    "it is important that in the steady - state regime the total current of actual charges ( electrons and positrons ) remains constant along the field lines , and is fixed by the goldreich - julian current at the zero - electric field boundary ( i.e. , in our case , at the effective radius @xmath68 ) .",
    "the electric field above @xmath68 ( in the regime of self - limitation ) is produced by the imbalance between the actual current and the local value of the goldreich - julian current . at distances greater than the effective radius @xmath68 for the goldreich - julian current we can write [ ieta ] di_gj ( > _ e ) .",
    "let us consider the situation when the fraction of positrons returning from the upper pff is not only sufficient to produce a lower pff , but is also big enough to affect the electric field accelerating the primary electrons .",
    "for example , the backflowing positrons tend to reduce the accelerating electric field above the effective surface of radius @xmath68 , simply because the positron current is equivalent to the enhanced electron current which unavoidably requires the electrons to be ejected from the greater heights above the effective surface .",
    "thus , the returning positrons may eventually screen the accelerating electric field and trigger an oscillating regime with alternating phases of developing and collapsing of double pair fronts .",
    "as has been mentioned above , the oscillatory regime akin to that we discuss here was anticipated in his classical paper by sturrock ( 1971 ) , even though he did not discuss the lower pff .",
    "the occurrence of the oscillatory regime depends on the fraction of backflowing positrons , which is determined by the particle kinematics within the upper pff and the penetration depth of the electrostatic field into the electron - positron plasma cloud . a quantitative description of this process would be possible through a detailed analysis of the electron - positron cascades and their feedback on the electrodynamics of the pair formation region .",
    "we can now estimate the maximum positron current needed to screen the electric field accelerating the primary electrons .",
    "for this purpose we assume that the bulk of the lower pair front sets up at the effective radius @xmath68 , and that the upper pair front establishes at the radial distance @xmath198 .",
    "then , for the maximum positron current we can write , using equations ( [ ietae ] ) and ( [ ieta ] ) , @xmath199 = \\nonumber \\\\ & & { { { \\cal i}_0}\\over { 2\\pi } }   \\left [ \\kappa \\eta _ { \\ast } ^3 \\cos \\chi +   { 3\\over 2 } h(\\eta ) \\theta ( \\eta ) \\xi \\sin \\chi \\cos \\phi \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath200 . the maximum value of the electric potential can be estimated as ( cf .",

    "given @xmath205 ( see section [ sec : numres ] ) , equation ( [ lam+max ] ) yields [ lam+num ] \\ { _ + } _ max ( 310 ^ -4 - 210 ^ -2 ) ( 0.15 ) ^2 .",
    "this estimate combined with the recently observed x - ray luminosities ( that include both pulsed and non - pulsed components and imply isotropic emission ) of pulsars ( see becker & trmper 1997 ) may have rather interesting implications .",
    "if the x - ray fluxes in some of these pulsars are dominated by the photons from the heated ( e.g. by the backflowing positrons ) pc , then luminosities higher than given by equation ( [ lam+num ] ) would indicate that these pulsars operate in the oscillatory regime discussed above .",
    "according to the estimates by becker & trmper the pulsed x - ray luminosities ( for the case of isotropic emission ) , @xmath206 , for e.g. crab , vela , geminga , and psr 0656 + 14 are , respectively , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 ( where @xmath211 , @xmath38 and @xmath212 are the pulsar spin frequency and its time derivative , respectively ) .",
    "although some of these pulsars have x - ray luminosities that lie above @xmath213 , the x - ray emission may not be isotropic ( see zavlin et al .",
    "if we assume that at least for vela , geminga , and psr 0656 + 14 ( see e.g. harding & muslimov 1998 for the modeling of the soft x - ray and @xmath214ray emission for these pulsars ) the x - ray emission is beamed into a solid angle of @xmath215 1 steradian , then for these pulsars we can estimate that @xmath216 , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding pc temperature for these pulsars can be estimated as t_pc ~(0.6 - 1 ) 10 ^ 6 ( 10 ^ 5  \\{_x^p}_anis ) ^1/4 ( b_0 ) ^1/2 ( r ) ^3/4 ( p ) ^-3/4  k. thus , the estimated value of @xmath219 may indicate that the backflowing positrons precipitate onto the effective area smaller than that of the standard pc ( e.g. the returning positrons focus toward the magnetic axis as discussed below ) , and/or that the fraction of the returning positrons is well below the maximum possible one . then the latter would support the quasi - steady state ( mh97 ) rather than the oscillatory ( sturrock 1971 ) regime of pulsar operation .",
    "the energetics of the pc heating is mainly determined by the energetics of the backflowing ( primary ) positrons .",
    "their energy is eventually redistributed between the high - energy photons they emit and electron - positron pairs created by photons in the magnetic field .",
    "let us consider the last open field line of the dipole magnetic field .",
    "the photons emitted by backflowing positrons produce pairs on adjacent innermost field lines , which may reduce the effective area of the pc subject to the heating . here",
    "we shall present very rough estimate of the geometrical filling factor for the pc heating qualitatively illustrating this effect .",
    "the photons emitted by backflowing positron ( moving along the last open field line ) at height @xmath220 above the effective radius @xmath68 produces a pair at the effective radius and at the angular distance from the magnetic axis r^ = ( r_e+s_c^+)- s_c^+ , where @xmath221 is the magnetic colatitude of the point at which the photon is emitted , and @xmath222 is the angle between the tangent to the field line at the point of photon emission and the normal to the stellar surface ( here we may justifiably neglect the surface curvature ) . in a flat space limit elementary geometrical consideration yields the relationship @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the angle between the tangent to the field line and the radius - vector of the point on the field line with the magnetic colatitude @xmath221 . for a dipole field , @xmath225 , so that @xmath226 , and we get r^ = r_e ( 1-s_c^+ ) .",

    "the above estimate can be additionally justified by the fact that @xmath220 increases toward the pc rim , while @xmath68 remains practically constant .",
    "we thus suggest that for some pulsars this effect may be worthy of discussion .",
    "following the procedure outlined in sections [ sec : ell]-[sec : pair ] , we have made numerical calculations of the pffs and the total acceleration length , @xmath232 , from equation ( [ sc ] ) , for both upward moving electrons and downward moving positrons .",
    "the parameters of the thermal radiation from the ns surface are somewhat uncertain .",

    "other possibilities , and how they might affect these results will be discussed in section [ sec : dis ] . an electron is started at height @xmath9 above the ns surface with @xmath236 . for a given value of @xmath9 and thus , @xmath237 , a ",

    "the pair attenuation length , and thus the value of @xmath23 , also computed at every step , is initially infinite , because the energy of the photons is small , but decreases with distance as the energy of the radiated photons increases .",

    "it this case , however , the larger angles between the thermal x - ray photons and the positrons allow them to accelerate through the resonant part of the ics losses at lower energies , and non - resonant ics of photons above the cyclotron energy produce the pff . since at pulsar field strengths , scattering above the cyclotron energy occurs in the kn regime , the scattered photon energies are much larger than those of photons scattered in the resonance .",

    "because cr is much less efficient than ics , the particles must accelerate to higher energies to produce pairs and the total acceleration length @xmath232 is longer .",
    "we first explore the solutions for the electron pff , as a function of pulsar parameters , for acceleration from the surface .",

    "these results can be directly compared with fig .",
    "5 of a83 , who computed the pff due only to curvature photons .",
    "figure [ fig : pcacch ] shows the strong effect of obliquity @xmath28 on the shape of the electron pff and on the acceleration voltage , due primarily to the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath28 . since the frame - dragging component of @xmath14 proportional to @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "equation [ [ ell_1 ] ] ) is much stronger near the surface than the component proportional to @xmath29 , it dominates at small and intermediate values of @xmath28 .",
    "the frame - dragging electric field becomes comparable to that in a flat space for orthogonal rotators ( @xmath245 ) , where our solutions match very well with those of a83 s fig .",
    "5 . the height of the cr - controlled pff ( @xmath23 ) increases and @xmath243 decreases with increasing @xmath28 , as @xmath14 decreases .",
    "the height of the pff increases sharply ( and in fact goes to infinity ) both at the magnetic pole ( @xmath246 ) and at the pc rim ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "these features , referred to as slot gaps by arons , form at the pole and equator due to different effects .",
    "the gap at the pole occurs because the radius of curvature of the magnetic field lines is infinite there , causing the pair attenuation length to go to infinity .",
    "the electrons keep accelerating to high altitudes and thus reach high energies . at the pc rim ,",
    "the boundary condition on the potential ( @xmath33 ) , screens @xmath14 close to the rim , preventing electron acceleration to high enough energy to produce any pairs .",
    "thus , @xmath243 also goes to zero at the rim .",
    "figure [ fig : pffxb ] shows the dependence of the pff height and acceleration voltage on surface magnetic field strength @xmath248 . while the height of the pff decreases with increasing @xmath248 , due both to an increase in @xmath14 and a decrease in pair attenuation length , @xmath243 is roughly constant even though @xmath248 varies over two decades .",
    "this is because the longer total acceleration distance for lower field strengths compensates for the lower rate of acceleration .",
    "figure [ fig : pffsx ] shows examples of ics - controlled pffs near the ns surface .",
    "we find that both the height of the pff and the acceleration voltage is much lower than for the cr - controlled pffs .",
    "this is due to the higher efficiency of ics in producing photons of pair - producing energy .",
    "zqlh97 obtained a similar result for ics - controlled pffs using the electric field of rs95 .",
    "electrons having lorentz factors of only @xmath249 , depending on @xmath244 , are capable of radiating photons of about @xmath250 to almost @xmath251 of their energy , and these photons will produce pairs .",
    "again , the maximum lorentz factor , @xmath252 , is a very weak function of field strength .",
    "the ics - controlled pff height , however , behaves very differently near the magnetic pole . instead of forming a slot gap , like the cr - controlled pffs",
    ", the height of the pff actually decreases near the pole .",
    "ics photons are radiated at much larger angles to the field and thus have shorter pair attenuation lengths than curvature photons .",
    "the above determinations of the electron pff are not fully self - consistent in that they have neglected pairs produced by the positrons that slow down to screen @xmath14 and accelerate down toward the stellar surface .",
    "even if the number of returning positrons is small compared to the number of primary electrons , the multiplicity of the downward cascades is high ( dh96 ) , due to the increasing field strength . from our simulations of downward going cascades using the code of dh96",
    ", we find that the multiplicity of a positron accelerated toward the pc from a height of one stellar radius at the pc rim is @xmath253 . if the fraction of positrons that are accelerated downward from the electron pff is @xmath254 ( see equations [ [ lam- ] ] and [ [ lam+ ] ] ) , then there are @xmath255 pairs produced by downward cascades for each primary electron .",
    "this would seem to be sufficient to screen @xmath14 and form a lower pff .    to compute the location of the lower pff ,",
    "a test positron is started at the upper ( electron ) pff with an energy of @xmath256 . in reality",
    ", there is a spread in energies of the pairs created near the electron pff , so that the most energetic ones will decelerate but not turn - around , while the less energetic ones will decelerate before they reach the pff and accelerate downward with varying initial energies .",
    "we have thus neglected the detailed kinematics of this turn - around process .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is then integrated to follow the downward acceleration of the positron and its energy losses due to both ics and cr , in the same manner as for the electron . likewise ,",
    "the attenuation lengths of the photons and the total acceleration length of the positron are computed .",
    "although the pffs of the positrons , like the electrons , are produced by pairs from the ics process near the ns surface in the presence of thermal radiation from a hot pc , we find that the positron pff is always above the start of the electron acceleration .",
    "that is , pair front formation by the ics process is not symmetric for upward and downward going particles .",
    "this is because the positrons scatter the thermal photons at much larger angles than the electrons . while the ics photons producing the electron pff scatter in the cyclotron resonance to an energy of @xmath257 , photons producing the positron pff scatter above the cyclotron resonance , in the kn regime ( see fig . [",
    "fig : prim1 ] ) , where the scattered energy is @xmath258 .",
    "this asymmetery will occur for field strengths @xmath259 , above which positrons will form pffs through resonant ics .",
    "as discussed further in section [ sec : analres ] , stable ics - controlled double pffs may exist for high - field pulsars because the scattered energy for resonant scattering is independent of incident angle .",
    "figure [ fig : epsmin ] shows the difference between the electron , @xmath260 , and positron , @xmath261 , energies that produce scattered photons of energy @xmath262 and @xmath263 that form the minimum pffs , as a function of @xmath9 . since their ics is more inefficient , the electrons must accelerate to much higher energies in order to produce scattered photons that pair - produce .",
    "the efficiency of electron scattering , @xmath264 , decreases with height , @xmath9 , above the surface , while the efficiency of positron scattering increases .",
    "therefore , the positrons are able to radiate pair - producing photons after traveling a shorter acceleration path . since the scattered energies of the positrons , at a given height , are greater that those of the electrons , these photons have shorter pair attenuation lengths .",
    "thus , the total positron acceleration length , @xmath265 is less than the total electron acceleration length , @xmath266 .",
    "figure [ fig : pffep ] shows total positron and electron acceleration lengths , @xmath266 and @xmath267 as a function of the electron starting height @xmath9 , for both ics- and cr - controlled pffs . in these calculations , we have allowed the self - consistent pffs of electrons and positrons to form with only one of the radiation mechanisms operating .",
    "when only ics produces pairs , @xmath266 is always significantly less than @xmath267 and the difference increases with height .",
    "however , when ics is suppressed and only cr is allowed to operate , @xmath266 and @xmath267 are equal .",
    "that is because cr for electrons and positrons is the same , the only difference being in radius of curvature between the radiation points , which is negligible since @xmath268 . while ics can not provide self - consistent solutions to the double pffs , cr can .",
    "we suggest that stable , self - consistent double pffs can only exist when they are formed by cr . since ics will dominate near the surfaces of nss radiating thermal soft x - rays , evidence of which has been observed in many pulsars , stable pffs can only form at a height above the surface where cr becomes dominant .",
    "we take a rough estimate for the height of cr - control of the electron and positron pffs to be where cr energy loss of the electrons dominates over ics energy loss .",
    "if electrons of energy @xmath269 radiate more curvature photons than ics photons , then the ics pff will disappear , and the electrons will continue accelerating until a curvature pff is established . when the positrons accelerating downward from the electron curvature pff also establish curvature photon pffs , then stable acceleration can occur . in reality , the pffs will switch from ics to cr control when the number of pairs produced by ics photons becomes too small to screen @xmath14 . but to determine the number of pairs necessary for establishing a lower pff , we would need to know the number of returning positrons .",
    "figure [ fig : gdot ] shows an example of the electron energy loss rates due to ics and cr at energy @xmath269 as a function of height of the lower pff . at low altitudes , ics losses dominate by many orders of magnitude , but decrease with @xmath9 mostly due to the decrease in the thermal photon density ( cf . equation [ [ n_ph ] ) .",
    "the energy @xmath269 of electrons that are forming the ics pff increase with altitude due to the decreasing efficiency of ics .",
    "their cr losses , which are a strong function of energy , therefore increase .",
    "the height at which electron ics and cr losses are equal , which roughly set the location of stable acceleration , will depend on the pc thermal temperature and radius ( cf .",
    "equation [ [ h_0 ] ] ) .    we have computed the height of the stable acceleration zones where cr losses dominate control of pffs for various pulsar parameters .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : pffh0 ] , the location of the lower ( positron ) pffs @xmath9 are at higher altitudes for higher surface magnetic field strengths , because the ics losses are proportional to @xmath270 for resonant scattering .",
    "the height of the lower pff decreases for increasing pulsar rotation period , @xmath53 , because at a given colatitude @xmath244 the radius of curvature increases , but the electron energy @xmath269 increases so that cr can dominate at a lower altitude .",
    "figure [ fig : pffp ] shows the width of the cr - controlled acceleration zone , @xmath267 ( i.e. the distance between the lower and upper curvature pffs ) and the maximum voltage drop , @xmath243 , as a function of pulsar period and surface field strength .",
    "the maximum particle energy is again remarkably insensitive to pulsar parameters , even though the acceleration zone width shows substantial variation .",
    "the width @xmath267 tends to be smaller for larger fields because both the acceleration length and the pair attenuation length are shorter .",
    "it has a large increase at long periods , where the pair attenuation lengths become large due to the increase in the pc radius of curvature .",
    "in fact , there will be a maximum period for which electron pffs can form at a given colatitude .",
    "figure [ fig : pffx ] shows solutions for the width and maximum lorentz factor of the self - consistent , stable acceleration zones that are controlled by cr double pffs .",
    "the width of these zones , located nearly a stellar radius above the surface , are larger than cr - controlled zones at the surface ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : pcacch ] and [ fig : pffxb ] ) , because the magnetic field has fallen from its surface value , so that @xmath14 is lower , and the radius of curvature is larger .",
    "however , the maximum lorentz factor of the higher altitude acceleration zones is roughly the same as that at the surface .",
    "again , the size of the acceleration path has adjusted itself to maintain the same maximum energy , which depends only on the geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "it is difficult to derive accurate analytic expressions for the acceleration zone parameters we have computed numerically , such as height and width of the stable accleration zone .",
    "the form of the electric field changes as a function of acceleration length ( see appendix ) , starting as a linear function and then saturating at @xmath271 to become a constant . consequently",
    ", there are no simple expressions for the processes that apply for altitudes from the surface to several stellar radii .",
    "nevertheless , we can characterize the behavior of the solutions in different regions .",
    "an estimate for @xmath9 , the height at which control of the pff formation switches from ics to cr , can be obtained by finding the height at which the loss rates for cr and ics of positrons with energy @xmath8 are equal : _ _",
    "ic(_min ) = _ _ cr(_min ) . we can obtain an estimate of @xmath8 by solving equation ( [ sc ] ) . for @xmath272 , we can use the expression for @xmath14 given in equation ( a3 ) of the appendix , which is linear in @xmath273 and thus gives a quadratic energy increase in particle energy with @xmath13 .",
    "the particle acceleration length is then : s_a ( ) = ( /a_)^1/2 where a _ ( 3e2mc^2 ) ( rc ) b_0 ( r_e ) ( rr_e)^2 .",
    "note that we have rescaled equation ( a3 ) to the effective radius @xmath274 , at which the acceleration begins .",
    "the pair attenuation length can be approximated as the mean free path s_p ( ) ( 0.2 _ c b ) valid for @xmath275 . equation ( [ sc ] ) may then be written , [ sceq ] s_c = min\\ { ( /a_)^1/2 + 0.2_cb } , where _ c r_e^1/2(c)^1/2 and b ( b_0b_cr)(r_er)^-3 .",
    "we wish to estimate @xmath8 when ics produces the pffs . for nearly all pulsar field strengths ( @xmath276 ) the photons which produce the positron pffs",
    "have been blue - shifted above the resonance and scatter in the kn regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : prim1 ] ) . in this case , we can approximate the scattered photon energy as @xmath277 . inserting this value of @xmath278 into equation ( [ sceq ] ) ,",
    "we then obtain @xmath8 giving the minimum @xmath232 by setting the derivative of @xmath232 with respect to @xmath0 to zero : [ gmin_kn ] ^kn_min = ( 0.4_ca_^1/2b)^2/3 = 3.4 10 ^ 5b_12 ^ -1/3(r_er ) ( ) ^1/3 . where @xmath126 is the surface field strength .",
    "thus , the particle energy required to radiate pair - producing photons increases with altitude , as was found in our numerical results ( cf .",
    "[ fig : epsmin ] ) .",
    "we can obtain an estimate for the width of the ics controlled acceleration zones by substituting @xmath279 from equation ( [ gmin_kn ] ) into equation ( [ sceq ] ) for the minimum value of @xmath232 , s^kn_c 5.3 10 ^ 3b_12 ^ -2/3 p^1/2r_6 ^ 1/2(r_er)^5/2()^-1/3 cm . we can estimate the height @xmath9 above the surface at which cr energy loss exceeds ics losses for the downward moving positrons of energy @xmath8 . from our numerical results",
    ", we found that at the altitudes where cr begins to dominate the particle energy loss , the ics is in the k - n regime above the resonance .",
    "we will therefore equate the curvature loss rate to the k - n loss rate to obtain an estimate for @xmath9 .",
    "substituting @xmath8 from equation ( [ gmin_kn ] ) in equation([gdot_cr ] ) for the cr energy loss , we have _ _ cr(^kn_min ) = 1.6 10 ^ 4 b_12 ^ -4/3r_6 ^ -1p^-1(r_er)^3 ( ) ^4/3s^-1 which sharply increases with altitude , @xmath237 .",
    "we approximate the k - n loss rate , modifying blumenthal & gould s ( 1970 ) formula for scattering of isotropic thermal photons of temperature @xmath280 , from a hot polar cap of radius @xmath119 , with a dilution factor that accounts for the fall - off in photon density with height @xmath281 : _ _ kn(^kn_min ) ( 4_min ktmc^2 ) r_t^2 h^2+r_t^2 7.6 10 ^ 8s^-1 t_6 ^ 2r_t^2h^2 for @xmath282 and ignoring the slowly varying @xmath283 factor . setting @xmath284 and assuming @xmath285 , [ h_0 ] ( h_0r)_kn 8.6b_12 ^ 4/15p^1/5r_6 ^ 1/5 t_6 ^ 2/5(r_tr)^2/5()^-4/15 .",
    "although the above expression involves a number of approximations , it does seem to roughly reproduce our numerical results .",
    "for example , taking the parameters @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xmath288 , @xmath289 and @xmath290 gives @xmath291 , fairly close to the value shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pffp ] .    at the altitude @xmath9 , where cr losses are dominant and",
    "curvature photons produce the pffs , the width of the acceleration zone can be calculated in a similar manner to that of the ics controlled acceleration zones . using the cr critical frequency , @xmath292 in equation ( [ sceq ] )",
    ", we can solve for the particle energy @xmath293 which produces the minimum acceleration zone width @xmath232 , [ gmin_cr ] ^cr_min = ( 6 c_p a_^1/2)^2/7= 4.710 ^ 7 b_12 ^ -1/7p^1/7 ( r_er ) ^4/7 r_6 ^ 1/7 ( ) ^1/7 , where c_p = ( 0.2_cb_cr ) .",
    "then substituting the expression for @xmath293 back into equation ( [ sceq ] ) for @xmath232 , we have [ sc_cr ] s^cr_c 4.8 10 ^ 4b_12 ^ -4/7 p^4/7r_6 ^ 4/7(r_er)^16/7 ( ) ^-3/7 cm . the expression for @xmath293 above is also a very good estimate of @xmath294 , the maximum lorentz factor of the cr - controlled accleration zone , because @xmath295 for cr photons ( i.e. the pff is very close to where the first pairs are produced ) .",
    "for very high field strengths ( @xmath296 ) both electron and positron ics operate in the resonant scattering regime .",
    "the incident soft photons scatter in the cyclotron resonance and their scattered energies are approximately @xmath297 . in the thomson limit of resonant scattering ,",
    "the energy of the scattered photons is independent of incident photon angle .",
    "this means that @xmath298 , pff@xmath20 will coincide with @xmath9 , and stable ics - controlled acceleration zones are thus possible for high - field pulsars .",
    "however , in the relatively high fields where resonant ics controls the positron pffs , relativistic effects on the resonant scattering cross section as well as photon splitting will become important ( as will be discussed in section [ sec : dis ] ) and our calculation of pffs is incomplete .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the effect of cascades from downward - accelerated positrons on the electrodynamics of the pc particle acceleration .",
    "we find that when ics produces pairs in the acceleration zone , the positron cascades may screen the accelerating electric field and disrupt particle acceleration near the ns surface .",
    "thus , if lower pffs can develop , the picture of steady particle acceleration from the pc surface must undergo major revision .",
    "we suggest that a stable acceleration zone may exist at an altitude of about one stellar radius above the pc , in which pairs from cr limit the electrostatic acceleration of primaries by screening the electric field near the upper pff .",
    "the calculations presented here are only a first attempt to describe the physics of what is a very complicated process .",
    "we have made many assumptions and approximations to obtain our results .",
    "while we believe that the gross qualitative results of our study are correct , there are a number of aspects which should be treated more accurately to achieve more solid quantitative results .",
    "we have assumed that the screening of the @xmath14 occurs over the short distance determined by the upper boundary condition of poisson s equation , not by the dynamics of the pair screening .",
    "the details of the pair screening also determine the fraction of pairs that return to the pc and we have briefly outlined in section ( [ sec : pfraction ] ) how such a calculation can be done within the electrodynamic framework set up in this paper .",
    "a determination of the returning positron fraction would answer some interesting questions , such as whether pc heating is important relative to cooling in setting the pc temperature and if so , whether there is a feedback loop between the formation of the upper pff and the pc heating .",
    "the characteristics of the downward cascades need further study and modeling .",
    "while we have done preliminary modeling of these cascades near the pc rim , there will be significant variation in pair yields with magnetic colatitude .",
    "near the magnetic pole , the pair multiplicity will drop , allowing the lower pff height to decrease or even disappear .",
    "we have found that the nature of the pc acceleration depends strongly on the characteristics of the radiation from the hot pc .",
    "thus , to solidify the quantitative aspects of our results , it is important to treat the thermal pc radiation and the ics process as accurately as possible .",
    "for example , we have assumed in this paper , that the thermal radiation is uniformly emitted over a pc of size @xmath299 with an isotropic flux distribution .",
    "however , studies of thermal radiation propagating through a strongly magnetized ns atmosphere ( pavlov et al . 1994 ) will not be isotropic , due to the anisotropy of the magnetized scattering cross section .",
    "the expected radiation pattern consists of a pencil component , beamed along the magnetic field and a fan component perpendicular to the field .",
    "such a beam pattern has been found to be consistent with observed thermal x - rays pulse fractions and pulse profiles for several pulsars ( shibanov et al .",
    "1995 , hm98 ) .",
    "in addition , our treatment of ics uses a combination of the ( non - relativistic ) magnetized cross section in the thomson limit for scattering near the fundamental cyclotron resonance , and the ( non - magnetic ) klein - nishina cross section to describe relativistic effects above the resonance . while this hybrid treatment is somewhat inaccurate for @xmath300 and therefore not completely satisfactory , the fully relativistic qed magnetic scattering cross section ( e.g. dh86 ) is too complicated for use in this type of calculation .",
    "in particular , the quantization of the electron momentum perpendicular to the field limits the number of landau states contributing to the cross section for each incident photon energy . the magnetic qed cross section for scattering just above the fundamental cyclotron resonance , and therefore the loss rate , could therefore be substantially lower than the klein - nishina cross section we have used here .",
    "unfortunately , there exists no simplified , approximate expression for the qed scattering cross section , which smoothly bridges , and allows a unified treatment of , the relativistic resonant and non - resonant regimes of ics .    a physical process which we have neglected in this study , photon splitting , is not expected to be significant for the magnetic fields we have considered , but will be very important for pulsars having surface @xmath301 .",
    "photon splitting , a third - order qed process in which one photon splits into two , operates only in very high magnetic fields and competes as an attenuation process with one - photon pair production ( harding et al .",
    "1997 ) because it can occur below pair threshold .",
    "the implications of photon splitting for pc pffs is profound .",
    "pulsars having @xmath301 will produce fewer pairs , especially near the surface , so that the cascades from downward - moving positrons may not produce a lower pff .",
    "this is about the same field strength where we found that double pffs controlled by resonant ics at the ns surface become possible .",
    "thus , the stable , cr - controlled double pff structure we have studied in this paper , which we found to move to higher altitudes with increasing surface field strength , will eventually collapse back to the surface at very high @xmath39 .",
    "a single pff will then form , controlled by ics , and the acceleration zone will have characteristics similar to that shown in figure [ fig : pffsx ] . at extremely high surface fields",
    ", @xmath302 photon splitting will suppress pair creation completely at this single pff , and the pulsar may be radio quiet ( baring & harding 1998 ) .",
    "however , the particle acceleration in these pulsars will operate very efficiently , free of any screening of @xmath14 , so they are expected to be observable at high energies .",
    "bound - state pair production , where photons convert to positronium just below pair threshold rather than converting to free pairs ( usov & melrose 1995 ) , may also come into play at higher field strengths .",
    "some of the main results that we have presented in this paper have some important implications for pulsar high - energy emission .",
    "one of these results is the insensitivity of the acceleration voltage ( maximum particle energy ) @xmath243 to any pulsar parameters such as period , surface magnetic field strength , obliquity ( except for nearly orthogonal rotators ) , and even height .",
    "this result showed up many times in the course of our calculations ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : pcacch ] , [ fig : pffxb ] , [ fig : pffsx ] , [ fig : pffp ] and [ fig : pffx ] , and equation [ [ gmin_cr ] ] ) , and seems to be a robust characteristic of this type of pc acceleration model .",
    "the maximum particle acceleration energy varies only within each pulsar , as a function of magnetic colatitude .",
    "this energy , between @xmath303 ev and @xmath304 ev for cr - controlled acceleration zones , is about two to three times higher than that without frame - dragging ( e.g. a83 ) , and is consistent with the primary particle energy required in cr - initiated pc cascade models of @xmath0-ray pulsars ( e.g. dh96 ) .",
    "the acceleration energy is very high near the magnetic poles , where the radius of curvature goes to infinity , allowing for the possibility of a narrowly beamed , hard component in @xmath0-ray pulses .",
    "however , the radiation power emitted by these high - energy particles will be small , because the curvature radiation loss rate is proportional to @xmath305 .",
    "the insensitivity of @xmath243 to pulsar parameters implies that the primary particles in all pulsars are accelerated to the same energy , and that the luminosity of the high - energy emission should depend only of the flux of primary particles .",
    "this is consistent with trends in the observed @xmath0-ray pulsar luminosities ( thompson et al .",
    "the @xmath0-rays will originate within a stellar radius of the upper stable pff , at height @xmath306 . from our results of figs .",
    "[ fig : pffh0 ] and [ fig : pffp ] , and equations ( [ h_0 ] ) and ( [ sc_cr ] ) , the height of the @xmath0-ray production increases with period , roughly as @xmath307 .",
    "the standard pc half - angle at height @xmath308 will be @xmath309 .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-ray emission solid angle @xmath310 , which is expected to be , @xmath311 $ ] , will be very weakly dependent on period and field strength .",
    "our conclusion that stable acceleration may occur in most pulsars at some altitude above the surface will have consequences not only for high - energy emission , but for radio emission as well .",
    "if electron - positron pairs are necessary for coherent radio emission , then the dependence of the pff altitude on pulsar parameters should be taken into account when determining the radio pulsar  death line \" , the line on the period - period derivative diagram beyond which pulsars are incapable of producing pairs .",
    "our calulcations in this paper suggest that pulsars with long periods do not produce pffs , and that there will be a  death line \" at periods below where there are observed radio pulsars .",
    "but this is a long - standing problem of pc acceleration , most recently discussed by arons ( 1998 ) , and one that should be addressed in future studies .",
    "our principal findings can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "lower pffs may form by positrons returning to the ns surface from the upper pff .",
    "pair creation by the ics process dominates near the stellar surface , but is not symmetric for upward and downward going particles , so that stable , double pff formation is very unlikely .",
    "stable , self - consistent double pffs can only exist when they are formed by cr .",
    "they can only form at a height above the surface where cr becomes dominant .",
    "the maximum particle energy is insensitive to any pulsar parameters such as period , surface magnetic field strength , obliquity , even height , and is sufficient to power @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that the cascades from positrons returning to the pc may have a significant effect on the primary particle acceleration in pulsars and should not be neglected .",
    "it is possible that lower pffs do not form for all pulsars , and may not form over the entire pc .",
    "a detailed study of the screening of the accelerating electric field by the returning positron cascades is beyond the scope of this paper , but will ultimately be necessary to understand pc acceleration .",
    "these studies are needed to address the questions of the returning positron fraction and the multiplicity of downward cascades .",
    "if we can show that the returning positrons do not screen @xmath14 , then the present assumption of acceleration right from the ns surface is valid .",
    "but if these studies show that screening at a lower pff is effective , then the possibility of acceleration above the ns surface must be incorporated in pc models .",
    "we thank the referee bing zhang for his very careful review and insightful comments .",
    "we are also grateful to joe daugherty , for help in the downward cascade simulations , to steve sturner for discussions on inverse - compton scattering and matthew baring for comments on the manuscript .",

    "<S> gamma - rays radiated by electrons accelerated from the stellar surface produce pairs in the strong magnetic field , which screen the electric field beyond a pair formation front ( pff ) . </S>",
    "<S> some of the created positrons can be accelerated back toward the surface and produce @xmath0-rays and pairs that create another pff above the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ics photons control pff formation near the surface , but due to the different angles at which the electron and positron scatter the soft photons , positron initiated cascades develop above the surface and screen the accelerating electric field . </S>",
    "<S> stable acceleration from the ns surface is therefore not possible in the presence of dominant ics energy losses . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that stable acceleration zones may occur at some distance above the surface , where cr dominates the electron and positron energy losses , and there is up - down symmetry between the electron and positron pffs . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the dependence of cr - controlled acceleration zone voltage , width and height above the surface on parameters of the pulsar and its soft x - ray emission . for most pulsars </S>",
    "<S> , we find that acceleration will start at a height of 0.5 - 1 stellar radii above the ns surface .    </S>",
