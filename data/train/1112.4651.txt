    "<S> the wind termination shock or reverse shock dramatically reduces the expansion speed of the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the period during which matter remains at relatively high temperatures and is exposed to high neutrino fluxes , thus allowing for further @xmath3 and @xmath4 reactions to occur and to synthesize elements beyond iron . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath0-process starts to efficiently produce heavy elements only when the temperature drops below @xmath5  gk . at higher temperatures , due to the low alpha separation energy of @xmath6zn ( @xmath7  mev ) </S>",
    "<S> the reaction @xmath8cu@xmath9@xmath10ni is faster than the reaction @xmath8cu@xmath3@xmath6zn . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the closed nicu cycle that we identify and discuss here for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the late phase of the @xmath0-process when the temperatures become too low to maintain proton captures . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the late neutron density , the evolution to stability is dominated by @xmath1 decays or by @xmath11 reactions . in the latter case , the matter flow can even reach the neutron - rich side of stability and the isotopic composition of a given element is then dominated by neutron - rich isotopes . </S>"
