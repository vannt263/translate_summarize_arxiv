    "it was found in @xcite that a curve in the virasoro - bott group is a geodesic for the right invariant @xmath0-metric if and only if its right logarithmic derivative is a solution of the korteweg - de vries equation , see ! 2.3 .",
    "vanishing geodesic distance for weak riemannian metrics on infinite dimensional manifolds was first noticed on shape space @xmath1 for the @xmath0-metric in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this result was shown to hold for the general shape space @xmath2 for any compact manifold @xmath3 and riemannian manifold @xmath4 , and also for the right invariant @xmath0-metric on each full diffeomorphism group with compact support @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , burgers equation is related to the geodesic equation of the right invariant @xmath0-metric on @xmath6 or @xmath7 and it thus also has vanishing geodesic distance .",
    "we even have    @xcite the weak riemannian @xmath0-metric on each connected component of the total space @xmath8 for a compact manifold @xmath3 and a riemannian manifold @xmath9 has vanishing geodesic distance .",
    "this result is not spelled out in @xcite but it follows from there : given two immersions @xmath10 in the same connected component , we first connect their shapes @xmath11 and @xmath12 by a curve of length @xmath13 in the shape space @xmath2 and take the horizontal lift to get a curve of length @xmath13 from @xmath14 to an immersion @xmath15 in the connected component of the orbit through @xmath16 .",
    "now we use the induced metric @xmath17 on @xmath3 and the right invariant @xmath0-metric induced on @xmath18 to get a curve in @xmath19 of length @xmath13 connecting @xmath20 with @xmath21 . evaluating at @xmath16 we get curve in @xmath8 of length @xmath13 connecting @xmath22 with @xmath16 .    in this article",
    "we show that the right invariant @xmath0-metric on the virasoro - bott groups ( see ! 2.1 ) has vanishing geodesic distance .",
    "this might be related to the fact that the riemannian exponential mapping is not a diffeomorphism near @xmath23 , see @xcite for @xmath6 and @xcite for the virasoro group over @xmath24 .",
    "see @xcite for information on conjugate points along geodesics .",
    "let @xmath25 be the group of diffeomorphisms of @xmath26 which rapidly fall to the identity .",
    "this is a regular lie group , see @xcite .",
    "the mapping @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and is a smooth group cocycle , called the bott cocycle : @xmath31    the corresponding central extension group @xmath32 , called the virasoro - bott group , is a trivial @xmath26-bundle @xmath33 that becomes a regular lie group relative to the operations @xmath34 other versions of the virasoro - bott group are the following : @xmath35 where @xmath7 is the group of all diffeomorphisms with compact support , or the periodic case @xmath36 .",
    "one can also apply the homomorphism @xmath37 to the center and replace it by @xmath24 . to be specific",
    ", we shall treat the most difficult case @xmath25 in this article .",
    "all other cases require only obvious minor changes in the proofs .",
    "the lie algebra of the virasoro - bott group @xmath38 is @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 ) with the lie bracket @xmath41 = \\binom{-[x , y]}{\\om(x , y ) } = \\binom{x'y - xy'}{\\om(x , y)}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 , which is a bounded skew - symmetric bilinear mapping satisfying the cocycle condition @xmath44,z)+\\om([y , z],x)+\\om([z , x],y)=0.\\ ] ] it is a generator of the 1-dimensional bounded chevalley cohomology @xmath45 for any of the lie algebras @xmath46 , @xmath47 , or @xmath48 .",
    "the lie algebra of the virasoro - bott lie group is thus the central extension @xmath49 induced by this cocycle .",
    "we have @xmath50 for each finite dimensional manifold of dimension @xmath51 ( see @xcite ) , which blocks the way to find a higher dimensional analog of the korteweg - de vries equation in a way similar to that sketched below .    to complete the description , we add the adjoint action : @xmath52 where the @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 which measures the deviation of @xmath20 from being a mbius transformation : @xmath55 the schwartzian derivative of a composition and an inverse follow from the action property : @xmath56      we shall use the @xmath0-inner product on @xmath57 : @xmath58 we use the induced right invariant weak riemannian metric on the virasoro group .",
    "according to @xcite , see @xcite for a proof in the notation and setup used here , a curve @xmath59 in the virasoro - bott group is a geodesic if and only if @xmath60 since we have @xmath61    thus @xmath62 is a constant in time and the geodesic equation is hence the _ korteweg - de  vries equation _ @xmath63 with its natural companions @xmath64    to be complete , we add the invariant momentum mapping @xmath65 with values in the virasoro algebra ( via the weak riemannian metric ) .",
    "we need the transpose of the adjoint action : @xmath66 thus , the invariant momentum mapping is given by @xmath67 along a geodesic @xmath68 , the momentum @xmath69 is constant in @xmath70 .",
    "we consider the extension @xmath71 then @xmath72 is a riemannian submersion for the right invariant @xmath0-metric on @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 is an isometry on the orthogonal complements of the fibers .",
    "these complements are not integrable ; in fact , the curvature of the corresponding principal connection is given by the gelfand - fuks cocycle .",
    "for any curve @xmath75 in @xmath73 its horizontal lift is given by @xmath76 since the right translation to @xmath77 of its velocity should have zero vertical component , see !",
    "the horizontal lift has the same length and energy as @xmath20 .",
    ".3.1 on all virasoro - bott groups mentioned in ! 2.1 geodesic distance for the right invariant @xmath0-metric vanishes .",
    "in @xcite for @xmath7 it was first shown that there exists one non - trivial diffeomorphism which can be connected to @xmath79 with arbitrarily small length .",
    "then , it was shown that the diffeomorphisms with this property form a normal subgroup . since @xmath7 is a simple group this concluded the proof .",
    "but @xmath73 is not a simple group since @xmath7 is a normal subgroup .",
    "so , we have to elaborate on the proof of @xcite as follows .",
    "proof we show that any rapidly decreasing diffeomorphism can be connected to the identity by an arbitrarily short path .",
    "we will write this diffeomorphism as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a rapidly decreasing function with @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath83 we define @xmath84 this is a ( non - smooth ) path defined for @xmath85 connecting the identity in @xmath73 with the diffeomorphism @xmath86 .",
    "we define @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a smoothing kernel with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus @xmath91 is a smooth path defined on the finite interval @xmath92 connecting the identity in @xmath93 with a diffeomorphism arbitrarily close to @xmath86 for @xmath94 small .",
    "( compare figure  [ fig ] for an illustration . )      * claim . * the mappings @xmath101 and @xmath102 are continuous into each @xmath103 with @xmath72 even .",
    "( the proofs are simpler when @xmath72 is even because there are no absolute values to be taken care of . ) to prove the claim , we calculate @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a polynomial without constant term in @xmath106 with coefficients also powers of @xmath107 .",
    "integrals of the form @xmath108 with @xmath109 are finite and continuous in @xmath110 since @xmath111 is rapidly decreasing .",
    "this shows that @xmath112 depends continuously on @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore the sequence @xmath113 converges almost everywhere for @xmath114 , thus it also converges in measure . by the theorem of vitali , this implies convergence in @xmath103 ,",
    "see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  16.6 ) .",
    "convolution with @xmath115 acts as approximate unit in each @xmath103 , which proves the claim for @xmath116 .",
    "for @xmath117 it follows similarly .",
    "the above claim implies that @xmath118 viewed as a mapping on @xmath119 ( first summand ) and on @xmath120 ( second summand ) is continuous in @xmath94 .",
    "it also vanishes at @xmath121 since then @xmath122 and @xmath116 have disjoint support .",
    "the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath123 implies that @xmath124 goes to zero as well .",
    "ultimately , @xmath125 is arbitrarily close to @xmath80 .",
    "proof the aim of the following argument is to construct a family of paths in the diffeomorphism group , parametrized by @xmath94 , with the following properties : all paths in the family start and end at the identity and their length in the diffeomorphism group with respect to the @xmath0 metric tends to @xmath23 as @xmath130 . by letting @xmath94 be time - dependent , we are able to control the endpoint @xmath131 of the horizontal lift for certain diffeomorphisms .",

    ", @xmath139 is constant .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we consider the function @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a function with @xmath142 $ ] and @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath144 $ ] be a function with compact support contained in @xmath145 and @xmath82 , so that @xmath146 is a diffeomorphism . for @xmath147 and @xmath148 $ ] let @xmath149 be the path going away from the identity ( since @xmath150 , see also figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "for given @xmath151 , let @xmath152 the path leading back again .",
    "the only difference to @xcite is that the parameter @xmath94 may vary along the path .",
    "we shall need some derivatives of @xmath20 and @xmath153 : @xmath154 * claim 1 . * the path @xmath20 followed by @xmath91 still has arbitrarily small length for the @xmath0-metric .",
    "we are working with a fixed time interval @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "thus arbitrarily small length is equivalent to arbitrarily small energy .",
    "the energy is given by @xmath156 looking at the formula for @xmath157 we see that @xmath158 is bounded on a domain with bounded @xmath62 .",
    "thus @xmath159 can be achieved by choosing @xmath94 , such that @xmath160 .",
    "we will see later that this is possible . inspecting @xmath161 and looking at the formulas for @xmath162 and @xmath153 we see that for @xmath163 and for @xmath164 we have @xmath165 .",
    "thus the domain of integration is contained in the compact set @xmath166\\times[-\\frac{t   + \\|g\\|_{\\infty}+2\\|\\ep\\|_{\\infty}}{\\lambda},\\frac{t   + \\|\\ep\\|_{\\infty}}{\\lambda}].\\ ] ] therefore , it is enough to show that the @xmath167-norm of the integrand in goes to zero as @xmath168 goes to zero .",
    "for all terms involving @xmath169 this is true by the above assumption since @xmath170 and @xmath158 are bounded . for the remaining parts @xmath171 and @xmath172 we follow the argumentation of @xcite . for @xmath70",
    "fixed and @xmath173 close to @xmath174 , the function @xmath175 , when restricted to the support of @xmath162 , is bigger than @xmath176 only on an interval of length @xmath177 .",
    "hence we have @xmath178 for the last part , we note that the support of @xmath179 is contained in the set @xmath180 .",
    "now we define @xmath181 by @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "then @xmath184 the estimate for @xmath91 is similar and easier .",
    "this proves claim 1 .    * claim 2 . * for every @xmath185 and @xmath186 we may choose @xmath176 with @xmath187 such that @xmath188 we will subject @xmath94 and @xmath111 to several assumptions .",
    "first , we partition the interval @xmath189 $ ] equidistantly into @xmath190 and the @xmath191-domain into two parts , namely @xmath192 \\cup [ t_e , t ] ) \\times \\mathbb r$ ] and @xmath193   \\times \\mathbb r$ ] .",
    "we want @xmath194 on a neighborhood of the interval @xmath195 $ ] .",
    "we choose @xmath176 to be constant @xmath196 on @xmath197 \\cup [ t_e , t]$ ] and to be symmetric in the sense , that @xmath198 .",
    "in addition , we want @xmath176 small enough , such that @xmath194 on @xmath199.$ ]      let @xmath193   \\times \\mathbb r$ ] be the region , where @xmath176 is not constant . in the interior , where @xmath206 we have by assumption @xmath207 .",
    "therefore , one has in this region : @xmath208 we divide the integral over @xmath209 into two symmetric parts @xmath210 and apply the following variable substitution to the second integral @xmath211 thus @xmath212 .",
    "together with @xmath213 this implies @xmath214 since @xmath215 changes sign , the term containing @xmath216 cancels out and leaves only @xmath217 a simple calculation shows that the integration limits transform @xmath218 to those of the first integral .",
    "therefore , the sum of the integrals gives @xmath219 from formula we see : @xmath220 we can use this to rewrite the above integral : @xmath221 looking at the formula for @xmath222 @xmath223 we see that @xmath224 is non - zero only on the intervals @xmath225 and @xmath226 . for small @xmath94 , these are two disjoint regions .",
    "therefore , the above integral equals @xmath227 for @xmath228 bounded and sufficiently small @xmath176 , the functions under the integral do not depend on @xmath176 any more as can be seen from the definitions of @xmath162 and @xmath222 .",
    "thus @xmath229 is independent of @xmath70 and we have @xmath230    the same calculations can be repeated for the return path @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is constant in time : @xmath233 note that the sign is positive now , which comes from the @xmath70-derivative . putting everything together gives us @xmath234 let @xmath235 where @xmath236 is a bump function with height @xmath174 and @xmath237 is a small constant .",
    "note that @xmath176 satisfies @xmath238 .",
