    "no physical system is ever in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "when we apply thermodynamics or statistical mechanics , we idealize the situation by assuming that `` fast '' processes have taken place , and `` slow '' ones will not : hence , we define an observation time scale which distinguishes these two kinds of processes  @xcite .",
    "it follows that the same system can be at equilibrium on one scale , and out of equilibrium on another , and , more strikingly , that it can be at equilibrium , but exhibiting different properties , on two scales at once .",
    "since the assumption of thermal equilibrium lies at the heart of statistical mechanics , it is usually hard to make these considerations without a strong appeal to one s intuition .",
    "we show in the following that they can be made in fact quite precise for a class of systems characterized by very slow energy flows .",
    "these systems are out of equilibrium , either because they are very gently `` stirred '' , i.e. , work is constantly made on them , or because they have undergone a quench from higher temperatures a long time ago .",
    "the most typical example of such a system is a piece of glass that has been in a room at constant temperature for several months .",
    "since the glass itself is not in equilibrium , we have in principle no right of talking about `` the temperature of the glass '' , but only about the temperature of the room .",
    "however , we may legitimately ask what temperature would indicate a thermometer brought into contact with the glass and , again , we would be very surprised if it did not coincide with the room temperature",
    ". we would be even more surprised if , putting two points of the glass in contact with both ends of a copper wire , a heat flow were established through it .",
    "in other words , although we know that equilibrium thermodynamics does not apply for the glass , we implicitly assume that some concepts that apply for equilibrium are still relevant for it .",
    "this is not because the glass is `` near equilibrium '' but rather because it has been relaxing for a long time , and therefore thermal flows are small .",
    "many attempts have been done to extend the concepts of thermodynamics to nonequilibrium systems  such as systems exhibiting spatiotemporal chaos or weak turbulence@xcite . in this context , hohenberg and shraiman @xcite",
    "have defined an effective `` temperature '' for stationary nonequilibrium systems through an expression involving the response , the correlation and the temperature of the bath .",
    "a closely related expression appears naturally in the theory of nonstationary systems exhibiting aging @xcite , such as glasses .",
    "we show here that this expression indeed deserves the name of temperature , because ( i ) the effective temperature associated with a time scale is the one measured on the system by a thermometer , in contact with the system , whose reaction time is equal to the time scale , ( ii ) it determines the direction of heat flows within a time scale and ( iii ) it acts as a criterion for thermalization .",
    "we shall here consider simultaneously two different conditions in which a regime with small flows of energy exists :    1 .",
    "ordinary thermodynamical systems in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath0 that are slowly driven ( `` stirred '' ) mechanically .",
    "the driving force is proportional to a small number which we shall denote @xmath1 .",
    "+ the observation time and the manner of the stirring are such that , for long enough times , the system enters a _ stationary _ , time - translational invariant ( tti ) regime @xcite : one - time average quantities are independent of time , two - time quantities depend only upon time - differences , etc .",
    "stationarity is a weaker condition than thermodynamical equilibrium , since it implies loss of memory of the initial condition but not all other properties that are linked with the gibbs - boltzmann distribution .",
    "purely relaxational systems that have been prepared through some cooling procedure ending at time @xmath2 and are kept in contact with a heat bath at a constant temperature @xmath0 up to a ( long ) waiting time @xmath3 ( as in the example of the glass ) .",
    "@xmath3 is also usually called `` annealing time '' in the glass literature . in this case",
    "physical quantities need not be tti , and in interesting cases they will keep a dependence upon @xmath3 ( and also , in many cases , upon the cooling procedure ) for all later times @xmath4 .",
    "we shall treat in parallel the `` weak stirring '' ( @xmath5 ) and the `` old age '' ( @xmath6 ) limits : both taken _ after the thermodynamical limit of infinite number of degrees of freedom_. we show that they lead to the same behavior , from the point of view of thermalization and effective temperatures , provided that one expresses time dependences in terms of the correlations of the system @xcite .    as a test of our ideas , we discuss thermalization in the context of the mean field theory of disordered systems , or the low - temperature generalization of the mode coupling equations , but the nature of our results makes us confident that they have a much wider range of validity .    in section",
    "ii we recall the generalization of the fluctuation - dissipation relation to the nonequilibrium case .",
    "in section iii we consider the reading of a thermometer coupled to a system : when the system is in equilibrium we show that the thermometer measures the temperature of the heat bath , while when it is out of equilibrium it measures different effective temperatures depending on the observation time scale .",
    "these effective temperatures are equal or higher than the one of the bath and are closely related to the fdt violation factor @xcite introduced to describe the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of glassy systems . in section",
    "iv we recall how time scales or correlation scales are defined in systems with slow dynamics .",
    "we then argue that , if the fdt violation factor is well defined within a time scale , a single degree of freedom thermalizes within that time scale to the corresponding effective temperature . in section v we extend this analysis to several degrees of freedom and show that the effective temperature determines the direction of heat flows , and can be used as a thermalization criterion . in section vi we discuss various phenomenological `` fictive temperature '' ideas that have been used for a long time in the theory of structural glasses .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section vii , where some experimental implications of our work are suggested .",
    "let us consider a system with @xmath7 degrees of freedom @xmath8 , whose dynamics is described by langevin equations of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gaussian thermal noise . for _ unstirred _ systems , we consider purely relaxational dynamics , where the average velocity @xmath11 is proportional to the gradient of the hamiltonian @xmath12 : @xmath13 the symmetric matrix @xmath14 is related to the correlation function of the noise @xmath15 by the einstein relations @xmath16 where @xmath0 is the temperature of the heat bath .",
    "averages over the thermal history , i.e. , averages over many realizations of the same experiment with different realizations of the heat bath , will be denoted by angular brackets .",
    "we assume of course @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "we have chosen the temperature units so that boltzmann s constant is equal to 1 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution is then proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath19 .    for _ stirred _ systems",
    ", we add to @xmath20 a perturbation proportional to @xmath1 , that can not be represented as the gradient of a function ( i.e. , is not purely relaxational ) , but is otherwise generic .",
    "we then have @xmath21 at stationarity , meaning that work is being made on the system @xcite .",
    "we denote the observables ( energy , density , magnetization , etc . ) by @xmath22 . throughout this work",
    "we shall denote by @xmath3 or @xmath23 the earliest time ( to be related to the waiting time ) , @xmath24 the latest time , and @xmath25 the relative time @xmath26 .",
    "these times are measured , in the case of the unstirred systems which exhibit aging , from the end of the cooling procedure .    given two observables @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we define their correlations @xmath29 , and their mutual response @xmath30 where @xmath31 appears in a perturbation of the hamiltonian of the form @xmath32 .",
    "obviously , causality implies @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "it is also useful to introduce the integrated response ( susceptibility ) @xmath35 let us now make a parametric plot  @xcite of @xmath36 vs.  @xmath37 for several increasing values of @xmath3 .",
    "we thus obtain a limit curve @xmath38 . in the case of a weakly driven system ,",
    "we wait for stationarity and plot @xmath39 vs.  @xmath40 for several decreasing values of the driving @xmath1 .",
    "we thus obtain the curve @xmath41 .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) relates the response and correlation function at equilibrium .",
    "one has    [ fdt1 ] @xmath42    if the equilibrium distribution is asymptotically reached for @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 in the case of strirred systems ) the fdt implies that the limit curve @xmath45 is a straight line of slope @xmath46 .",
    "however , there is a family of systems for which the limiting curve @xmath45 _ does not _ approach a straight line ( see figs .",
    "[ figp3chialpha ] and [ figp3chitfinite ] ) . for driven systems",
    "this means that the slightest stirring is sufficient to produce a large departure from equilibrium _ even at stationarity _",
    "[ figp3chialpha ] ) , while in the case of a relaxational system it means that the system is unable to equilibrate within experimental times ( fig .",
    "[ figp3chitfinite ] ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath47 the slope of the curve @xmath45 : @xmath48 this corresponds to @xmath49 where the derivative is taken with respect to the earlier time .",
    "we have thus defined @xmath50 , the fdt violation factor @xcite , for nonequilibrium systems with slow dynamics .",
    "when fdt holds , for @xmath44 ( or @xmath51 respectively ) we can treat the system as being in equilibrium and @xmath52 tends to 1 in the limit .",
    "when this does not happen , we may inquire about the physical meaning of @xmath50 . in order to answer this question ,",
    "let us first recall the relationship there is between the fdt and the equipartition of energy .",
    "we use a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath53 to measure the `` temperature '' of a degree of freedom @xmath22 ( @xmath22 may be the energy , or some spatial fourier component of the magnetization ) . at the waiting time",
    "@xmath3 we weakly couple the oscillator to the system via @xmath22 , while we keep the system in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "we wait for a short time until the average energy of the oscillator has stabilized .",
    "if the system were in equilibrium , by the principle of equipartition of energy we would have @xmath54 .    assuming linear coupling , the hamiltonian reads :",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 the equation of motion of the oscillator reads @xmath57    in the presence of the coupling , if @xmath58 is sufficiently small ( an assumption we have to verify _ a posteriori _ ) , we can use linear response theory to calculate the action on @xmath59 of the oscillator : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fluctuating term and where the response function @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63 we assume moreover that the average @xmath64 exists ( we set it to zero by a suitable shift of @xmath65 ) and that the fluctuations of @xmath66 ( in the absence of coupling ) are correlated as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a quantity of @xmath69 .",
    "the equation for @xmath65 then reads @xmath70 thus the oscillator takes up energy from the fluctuations of @xmath59 , and dissipates it through the response of the system .",
    "equation ( [ osc ] ) is linear and easy to solve in the limit of small @xmath71 by fourier - laplace transform .",
    "one thus obtains the following results , whose proof is sketched in appendix [ appthermo1 ] .",
    "consider first the case of stirred systems at stationarity , in which both the correlation and the response are tti .",
    "the average potential energy of the oscillator reaches the limit @xmath72 after a time @xmath73 given by @xmath74 we have defined @xmath75    if we now define the temperature @xmath76 as follows : @xmath77 we obtain @xmath78 this is precisely the temperature defined by hohenberg and shraiman @xcite for the case of weak turbulence ( the spatial dependence is encoded in @xmath22 ) .",
    "let us now turn to the case of relaxational dynamics where tti is violated .",
    "here we have to take into account the time @xmath3 at which the measurement is performed , and consider @xmath79 .",
    "then , a similar calculation yields for the energy of the oscillator @xmath80 where the average @xmath81 is taken on a comparatively short time stretch after @xmath3 .",
    "this definition of the frequency- and waiting - time - dependent correlation @xmath82 and out - of - phase susceptibility @xmath83 closely follows the actual experimental procedure for their measure : one considers a time window around @xmath3 consisting of a few cycles ( so that phase and amplitude can be defined ) and small enough respect to @xmath3 so that the measure is `` as local as possible in time '' . in fact , these two quantities are standard in the experimental investigation of aging phenomena in spin - glasses @xcite .",
    "the natural definition of the frequency- and time - dependent temperature of @xmath59 is then @xmath84 if equilibrium is achieved , then the temperature is independent of @xmath3 , of the frequency @xmath53 and of the observable @xmath59 , and coincides with that of the heat bath .",
    "the index @xmath59 recalls that the effective temperature may depend on the observable .",
    "the frequency - dependent temperature defined by either ( [ hohenberg ] ) or ( [ effectt ] ) is compatible with the fourier transformed expression of the fdt violation factor ( [ qfdt ] ) provided that it does not vary too fast with @xmath53 .",
    "we show later that this is indeed the case for systems with slow dynamics .    for this definition",
    "we have chosen somehow arbitrarily an oscillator as our thermometer .",
    "however , we show in appendix [ appthermo2 ] that the same role can be played by any small but macroscopic thermometer , weakly coupled to the system .",
    "the role of the characteristic frequency @xmath53 is then played by the inverse of the typical response time of the thermometer .",
    "now @xmath85 only deserves to be called a `` temperature '' if it controls the direction of heat flow . a first way to check whether this is the case is to consider an experiment in which we connect the oscillator to an observable @xmath27 and",
    "let it equilibrate at the temperature @xmath86 .",
    "we then disconnect it and connect it to another observable @xmath28 and let it equilibrate at the temperature @xmath87 .",
    "this is not like a maxwell demon , since the times of connection and disconnection are unrelated to the microscopic behavior of the system .",
    "the net result is that an amount of energy @xmath88 has been transferred from the degrees of freedom associated with @xmath27 to those associated with @xmath28 : therefore the flow goes from high to low temperatures .",
    "this is an actual realization of the idea of `` touching two points of the glass with a copper wire '' described in the introduction .",
    "this observation also suggests a possible explanation of the fact that all fdt violation factors which we know of are smaller than one : if @xmath89 were smaller than the temperature of the heat bath , it could be possible , in principle , to extract energy from the bath by connecting between it and our system a small carnot engine .",
    "the argument can be made sharper by considering a stationary situation in a weakly stirred system : but to argue that this situation would lead to a violation of the second principle one needs to prove that the equilibration times of the carnot engine are short enough to make the power it produces larger than the dissipated one .",
    "before discussing the effective temperature as an equilibration factor we need to introduce some general features of the time - evolution of systems with slow dynamics .",
    "we first define the time - correlation scales and we then argue that , if the fdt violation factor is well defined within a time scale , a single degree of freedom thermalizes within that time scale at the corresponding effective temperature .",
    "systems having a long - time out - of - equilibrium dynamics tend to have different behaviours in different time - scales .",
    "let us start by describing them for long - time dynamics in the purely relaxational case . in appendix [ appscales ] we give a formal definition of correlation scale , following ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider first , as an example , the dynamics of domain growth @xcite for the ising model at low but non - zero temperatures . the autocorrelation function @xmath90 exhibits two regimes :    * at long times @xmath91 , such that @xmath92 , the correlation function shows a fast decay from @xmath93 ( at equal times ) to @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the magnetization .",
    "this regime describes the fast relaxation of the spins within the bulk of each domain .",
    "* at long and well separated times ( @xmath96 ) , the correlation behaves as a function of @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is some measure of the typical domain size at time @xmath24 .",
    "we refer to these two scales as `` quasiequilibrium '' and `` coarsening '' ( or `` aging '' ) , respectively . after a given time",
    ", the correlation rapidly decays to a plateau value @xmath94 , and the speed with which it falls below that value becomes smaller and smaller as @xmath3 grows .",
    "this example helps to stress the fact that different scales are defined as a function of both times ( in this case @xmath26 finite , @xmath97 finite ) and are well separated only in the limit where both times are large .    in fourier space ,",
    "this separation of scales is achieved by considering several frequencies @xmath99 and increasing times @xmath3 .",
    "then , if we consider @xmath100 for increasing @xmath3 , we probe the quasiequilibrium scale , while if we want to probe the aging or coarsening scale we have to consider smaller and smaller @xmath99 , keeping @xmath101 .    if we now consider two frequencies @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and keep @xmath104 we shall probe , as @xmath105 , the _ same _ scale : it will be the quasiequilibrium scale if they both remain finite , or the coarsening ( aging ) one if we keep @xmath106    these considerations can be generalized to other systems with slow dynamics .",
    "in general there may be more than two relevant scales @xcite , for example @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , etc . in any case",
    ", the condition for looking into the same scale via two successions of frequencies remains eq .",
    "( [ scales ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figp3ctwa1 ] we show the numerical solution of our test model , defined in appendix [ appmodel ] .",
    "the auto - correlation function @xmath37 is plotted vs.  the time difference @xmath26 for several waiting times in log - log scale .",
    "these plots ( which are standard in the montecarlo simulations of spin - glasses @xcite ) , show ( i ) that the system is out of equilibrium , since we have an explicit dependence on @xmath3 , and ( ii ) that there are at least two time - correlation scales . for short time differences",
    "@xmath26 the decay is fast , the auto - correlation function is tti and it falls from 1 to @xmath110 .",
    "it then decays further from @xmath110 to zero , more and more slowly as the waiting time increases .",
    "the quantity @xmath110 is known in the language of spin - glasses as the edwards - anderson order parameter and in mode coupling theory ( mct ) as the non - ergodicity parameter : it measures the strength of the fast correlations ( @xmath111 in domain growth ) .",
    "quasiequilibrium and aging regimes are experimentally observed in real spin - glasses and polymer glasses@xcite .",
    "let us now turn to a similar analysis for driven systems in the limit of weak driving energy @xmath5 . in that case ,",
    "even if the system reaches a tti regime provided we wait long enough ( the amount of waiting increases when the stirring rate @xmath1 decreases ) , it sometimes happens that some correlations and responses acquire a non - trivial low frequency behaviour in the limit @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ figp3ctwalpha ] we show the same plot as in fig .  [ figp3ctwa1 ] , i.e. , @xmath40 vs.  @xmath26 , for different , but small , stirring rates .",
    "we see that there are at least two time scales : one , for short time differences , where the correlation decays rapidly from 1 to @xmath110 and one , for long time differences , in which it slowly decays from @xmath110 to zero . the smaller the stirring , the slower the decay of @xmath112 from @xmath110 to zero .",
    "it is useful to consider , in these cases , frequencies that go to zero as some function of @xmath1 .",
    "the condition that two sequences of frequencies @xmath113 correspond to the same scale now reads @xmath114      let us now consider a system at a given waiting time @xmath3 or stirring rate @xmath1 .",
    "heat flows tend to zero as @xmath105 or @xmath44 respectively .",
    "it is the reasonable to assume that , in these limits , the _ effective temperatures _ associated with any given observable @xmath59 on a given time scale tend to equalize , provided that their limit is finite .",
    "we thus have , for example in the case of relaxational dynamics , for @xmath115 , @xmath116 similarly , we expect that each fixed frequency sooner or later thermalizes with the bath : @xmath117 in some important cases the effective temperatures defined by eqs .",
    "( [ hohenberg]),([effectt ] ) diverge in the limit @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) . in these cases",
    "the effective temperature @xmath89 should diverge for the whole time scale .",
    "we shall dwell on this problem in sec .  c.    equations ( [ univ ] ) and ( [ univ1 ] ) are trivially true in a system that reaches thermal equilibrium , where all effective temperatures eventually reach the temperature of the reservoir .",
    "however , they also describe the situation in which smaller frequencies take longer to reach the temperature of the heat bath , in such a way that at each given ( long ) waiting time there are low enough frequencies that have a temperature substantially different ( in all cases we know , higher ) from that of the bath .",
    "in particular , eq .",
    "( [ univ1 ] ) allows us to answer a question we asked at the beginning : if a piece of glass has been kept at room temperature for several months , a thermometer whose response time is of order of a few seconds would measure the room temperature , but it would read a higher temperature if its response time is of the order of weeks .",
    "in fact , with the appropriate handling of time - scales @xcite ( see appendix [ appscales ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ univ ] ) and ( [ univ1 ] ) make it possible to calculate the out - of - equilibrium relaxation of mean - field spin - glasses , and also the low temperature generalization of the mode - coupling equations for one single mode .",
    "we thus obtain a solvable example where eqs .",
    "( [ univ ] ) and ( [ univ1 ] ) hold .    for the case of stirred systems",
    ", the @xmath44 limit plays the same role as the @xmath105 limit in relaxational systems , provided that the time scales are suitably redefined as in eq .",
    "( [ scales1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , at each fixed value of @xmath99 one has @xmath118 , and , for @xmath115 one has @xmath119 provided that the limits are finite .",
    "if one looks into a time scale within which the temperature is almost constant , one can indifferently use a temperature defined in terms of a frequency or a time . in the relaxational case one",
    "has @xmath120 provided that @xmath121 . in the same situation",
    "one has @xmath122 similar relations hold for the driven case .",
    "if , on the contrary , one considers values of frequency or time for which the temperature defined by eq .",
    "( [ ttt ] ) is not constant , one can not directly relate it with the reading of a thermometer coupled to the system .",
    "an important physical situation which deserves a special discussion is that of domain growth . in this case",
    "the effective temperature ( associated , say , with the total magnetization ) in the `` coarsening scale '' , @xmath123 , tends to infinity as @xmath105 .",
    "the curve @xmath124 ( magnetic susceptibility ) vs.  @xmath112 ( magnetization correlation ) looks like in fig .",
    "[ figp2chitfinite ] .",
    "this figure shows the results for a model that is equivalent to the @xmath69 ferromagnetic coarsening in three dimensions .",
    "the integrated response @xmath124 becomes flat , as @xmath6 , in the aging regime .",
    "in other words , the long - term memory _ tends to disappear_.    because experimental measures of aging are in general related to the response , this kind of system is sometimes referred to as exhibiting aging `` in the correlations '' ( correlations are not tti ) but not in the response .",
    "one should stress , however , that the divergence of the effective temperature in the aging time scale can be extremely slow : for example , in the fisher - huse model for spin - glasses @xcite @xmath89 grows like a power of @xmath125 .",
    "the fact that the effective temperature in the aging regime tends to infinity means that if we measure it at @xmath99 small and fixed , the temperature @xmath126 grows with @xmath3 ( while we are still probing the aging regime ) and then starts falling , finally reaching the temperature of the bath .",
    "if we repeat the experiment with a smaller @xmath99 , the overall behaviour is the same , but the highest temperature reached will be higher ; and so on without an upper limit .",
    "the situation is similar , but experimentally more subtle , for `` stirred '' systems for which the effective temperatures diverge as @xmath44 . in such cases",
    "we measure a system that has a given ( small ) driving @xmath1 . if the system is such that for @xmath5 the effective temperature of all but the fastest scale tend to infinity , we may never realize that this is the case in an experimental situation , as long as we are not able to repeat the experiment with smaller and smaller stirring .",
    "we show one such case in fig .",
    "[ figp2chialpha ] , which represents the same coarsening problem as before , but made stationary by a `` stirring '' term in the equation of motion proportional to @xmath1 . if one had performed an experiment on such a system for a fixed @xmath1 , one would have observed high effective temperatures for separated times , and no evidence of thermalization . only by letting @xmath1",
    "take smaller and smaller values one can notice that in fact these temperatures tend to infinity .      in mean - field models",
    "one can close the schwinger - dyson equations into a set of dynamical equations involving only the correlation and response functions .",
    "this allows us to solve them analytically for large times , and also to obtain their full solution , via a numerical integration , starting from a pair of initial times @xmath127 .",
    "we thus obtain the curve @xmath45 by integrating the response function and plotting it vs.@xmath112 .",
    "two cases in which there are only two time - correlation scales are the test model @xcite considered here ( cf . appendix [ appmodel ] ) and the case of a particle moving in an infinite - dimensional random medium with short - range correlations @xcite .",
    "both the analytical and the numerical results exhibit thermalization within the aging regime .    in the sherrington - kirkpatrick spin - glass model",
    "there is a full hierarchy of time scales and effective temperatures , a fact also confirmed numerically @xcite and by monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "another model with infinite many scales and with a full hierarchy of effective temperatures is that of a particle moving in an infinite - dimensional random medium with long - range correlations @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the monte - carlo simulation of the `` realistic '' 3d edwards - anderson model for a spin - glasses was used to obtain the @xmath45 curves , which seem to approach a non - trivial curve for increasing @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests the existence of a hierarchy of time - correlation scales .",
    "the `` trap model '' for spin - glass dynamics @xcite violates eq.([univ ] ) when an unusual choice of a parameter ( @xmath128 ) is made .",
    "however , it is difficult to interpret the model , with this choice of parameter , as a phenomenological model stemming from a reasonable microscopic dynamics .",
    "as we remarked in section iii , a _ bona fide _ temperature should control heat flow and thermalization .",
    "it is the aim of this section to show that this is indeed the case for the effective temperature we have defined .",
    "if this were not the case , it would be possible to use our small oscillator to transfer heat from some degrees of freedom to others : in other words , by decorating our copper wire with a suitable frequency filter , we would observe heat flowing through it when it touches the two end of the glass",
    ".    we shall argue that if different degrees of freedom _ effectively interact _ on a given time scale , then they thermalize on that scale .",
    "a useful  though not universal  criterion for `` effective interaction '' is that their mutual response ( the response of one of the degrees of freedom to an oscillating field of the given frequency conjugate to the other degree of freedom ) is of the same order as their self - response on that time scale .",
    "the argument is essentially the same both for relaxational systems that have evolved for a long time , or in stationary driven systems in the limit of small driving energy .",
    "we shall thus focus on the relaxational case only .",
    "we emphasize again that the thermalization of different degrees of freedom is well defined only in the limit of vanishing heat flow , i.e. , long waiting times or vanishing stirring rates respectively .",
    "this is witnessed by the appearance of one ( or more ) well separated plateaus in the decay of the two - time correlation functions .",
    "let us consider @xmath129 modes ( labelled by @xmath130 ) .",

    "[ figtwosystasym ] the corresponding plot for two weakly coupled systems in the limit of small stirring .",
    "let us briefly discuss what would happen in the presence of many scales , each one with its own temperature .",

    "actually , ( [ superthermo ] ) was obtained as an ansatz for the dynamics of a manifold in a random medium within the hartree approximation @xcite , where the role of different observables is played by the displacements at different spatial wavelengths : @xmath190 in this case , the modes at different @xmath191 thermalize at the same effective temperature , although their mutual responses vanish , as implied by translational symmetry in mean .",
    "the idea of `` fictive temperatures ''  @xcite @xmath192 in glasses goes back to the 40s and it has developed since @xcite . here",
    "we recall it briefly , for the sake of comparison with the effective temperature that we have discussed .",
    "when cooling a liquid the time needed to establish equilibrium grows and , eventually , the structural change can not keep pace with the rate of cooling : the system falls out of equilibrium and enters the glass transition region .",
    "it is then said that `` the structure is frozen '' at a temperature characterized by a fictive temperature @xmath192 . the fictive temperature defined in terms of different quantities of interest , e.g. , the enthalpy , the thermal expansion coefficient , etc .",
    ", do not necessarily coincide .",
    "furthermore , it has been experimentally observed that glasses with the same fictive temperatures arrived at through different preparation paths may have different molecular structures .",
    "the fictive temperature is hence a phenomenological convenience and should not be associated with a definite molecular structure @xcite .",
    "the fictive temperature is a function of the temperature of the bath @xmath0 . at high temperature , when the sample is in the liquid phase , @xmath193 .",
    "when the liquid enters the transition range @xmath192 departs from @xmath0 and @xmath194 ; and , finally , deep below the transition range , where the relaxation is fully stopped , @xmath195 .",
    "the detailed bath - temperature dependence of the fictive temperature in the region of interest is usually expressed by  @xcite @xmath196 where the characteristic time @xmath197 depends both upon @xmath198 and upon the thermal history of the sample given by @xmath199 . at equilibrium @xmath193 and @xmath200 .",
    "this nonlinear differential equation determines @xmath198 once one _ chooses _ @xmath197 .",

    "all the information about the dynamics of the system enters into @xmath192 through these constants .    in order to obtain the time relaxation of the quantity of interest , the picture is completed by proposing a given relaxation function , like the stretched exponential , the davidson - cole function , etc . , and by introducing the fictive temperature through the characteristic time @xmath197 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive discussion about the applications of @xmath192 to the description of experimental data .",
    "one may wonder whether is a relation between this _ fictive _ temperature of glass phenomenology and the _ effective _ temperature we have been discussing in this paper .",
    "first of all , one notes that the fictive temperatures are defined through the relaxation of the observables , unlike the one we consider here which are defined rather in terms of fluctuations and responses .",
    "both temperatures may depend upon the observable and upon the thermal history of the sample .",
    "the dependence of the effective temperature defined in eq .",
    "( [ figp3ctwa1 ] ) upon @xmath0 depends on the model . in all cases",
    "fdt holds in the high temperature phase and @xmath205 , the effective temperature is equal to the bath temperature . when entering the low temperature phase , the temperature dependence of the effective temperature observed at fixed low frequency depends on the model . in certain simple mean - field ( or low - temperature mode - coupling )",
    "models whose dynamics following a quench into the glass phase can be solved , one can compute @xmath89 explicitly .",
    "three different behaviours are found :    * in the simple model we have been using as a test example in the previous sections @xcite , @xmath89 starts from @xmath206 at @xmath207 and slightly _ increases _ when the bath temperature decreases below @xmath208 .",
    "one would instead expect a fictive temperature to remain stuck to @xmath208 in a ( mean - field ) model in which the glass transition is sharp .",
    "* there are other mean - field models such as the sherrington - kirkpatrick spin - glass model in which there are infinitely many different effective temperatures .",
    "the lowest aging - regime temperature appears discontinuously ( @xmath209 ) as one crosses @xmath208 and can be shown @xcite to _ decrease _ with decreasing temperature .",
    "another example of this kind is the model of a particle moving in a random potential with long - range correlations @xcite .",
    "* in all cases we know of domain growth models @xcite one obtains @xmath210 for @xmath144 , in the whole low temperature phase .",
    "hence @xmath211 in the aging ( coarsening ) regime for all heat bath temperatures below the ordering transition .",
    "this behaviour also holds for certain extremely simple disordered systems such as the spherical sherrington - kirkpatrick spin - glass @xcite , the toy domain growth model we used in this paper .",
    "it is important to remark that these simple examples have the ( sometimes unrealistic ) feature that nothing depends permanently upon the cooling procedure .",
    "one expects , however , that more refined models that go beyond the mean - field approximation will capture a cooling rate dependence that will also become manifest in the effective temperature .",
    "another attempt to identify and relate a microscopic effective temperature to the fictive temperature of glasses was put forward by baschnagel , binder and wittmann @xcite in the context of a lattice model for polymer melts .",
    "they have pointed out that in this model the usual fdt relation between the specific heat with the energy fluctuations is broken at low temperatures and have tried to identify the fdt violation factor with an expression they propose for an _ internal temperature_. the internal temperature defined in ref .",
    "@xcite has , however , the unpleasant property of not reducing to the bath temperature in the high temperature phase .    in ref .",
    "@xcite franz and ritort have also discussed the possibility of relating the fdt ratio with an effective temperature , in the particular case of the backgammonn model .",
    "they have compared the the value of @xmath212 for finite times @xmath91 with the temperature arising from an adiabatic approximation they used to solve the model .",
    "the result is negative , in the sense that @xmath213 does not coincide with the `` adiabatic temperature '' .",
    "these examples suggest that the phenomenological fictive temperatures act essentially as parameters for describing an out - of - equilibrium `` equation of state '' while the effective temperature we have discussed plays a role closer to the thermodynamical one .",
    "although our discussion has been biased by the models we can solve at present , we feel that the concept of the effective temperature that we discussed should be relevant for many systems _ with small energy flows_. indeed , the key observation we make is that this temperature actually controls thermalization and heat flows within a time - scale .",
    "therefore , the effective temperature can be a starting point for the investigation of the thermology and , hopefully , the thermodynamics of out - of - equilibrium systems with small energy flows .    in order to use this idea as a guiding concept for the planning of experiments , one has to take some care : obviously , waiting times can be large but not infinite in experiments , and stirring rates can be small but not infinitesimal . moreover , the models that we have explicitly discussed do not exhibit dependence on the cooling history of the sample .",
    "now , one would expect in general the effective temperature to depend on @xmath24 , @xmath3 and , e.g. , on the cooling rate .",
    "one can hope to catch this aspect in more refined models .",
    "one should also pay attention to the equilibration times .",
    "the effective temperature measured by a small oscillator is related to the fdt violation factor provided that the equilibration time @xmath214 ( eq.([tc ] ) ) remains much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "it sometimes happens that an observable @xmath59 which should thermalize at an effective temperature @xmath215 exhibits so small fluctuations at this frequency that this time becomes unbearably long .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of high @xmath191 modes in the aging time scale for a manifold in a random potential .",
    "therefore , although all @xmath191 modes nominally thermalize at the same effective temperature , only low enough @xmath191 modes can be effectively used to measure it . how low @xmath191 must be will depend on the time scale one is looking at .",
    "several numerical and real experiments in structural glasses can be envisaged .",
    "for example , one can compare density - fluctuations and compressibility in different length scales in order to check if they are equilibrated within a time - scale . since the low - temperature extension of the mct makes definite predictions on the value of the first non - trivial effective temperature appearing as one crosses the transition ( see section vi )",
    ", this provides a concrete ground for a experimental testing of mct .",
    "we close by considering the following ( slightly _ gedanken _ ) spin - glass experiment of fig . [ figdibu ] : currents are induced in the coil by the magnetization noise of the spin - glass , which is in contact with a heat bath .",
    "apart from the interaction with the sample , the l - c circuit of coil and capacitor is without losses .",
    "this is exactly a realization of the oscillator as a thermometer of section ii . from what we know from the time - scales of real spin - glasses",
    "@xcite , if the time after the quench is of the order of 10 minutes , and the period of the l - c circuit is of the order of the second , we are probing ( at least partially ) the aging regime : the temperature ( defined as the average energy of the capacitor ) should be different from the bath temperature .",
    "we believe that it would be interesting to return to the magnetization noise experiments @xcite with the purpose of measuring the effective temperature : this would give us , for instance , useful insights into the nature of the spin - glass transition .    [ coil ]",
