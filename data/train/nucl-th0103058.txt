    "@xcite the authors recently presented an application of the kohn variational principle ( kvp ) in its complex form to calculate the elastic observables in p - d scattering for energies above the deuteron breakup threshold ( dbt ) .",
    "the kvp was implemented to describe continuum states of three outgoing particles including the distortion due to the coulomb interaction in the asymptotic region .",
    "only two energies were considered , @xmath2 and @xmath3 mev .",
    "the validity of the kvp for the elastic @xmath1-matrix describing the @xmath4 process in p - d scattering for energies above the dbt has been extensively discussed in ref",
    ".  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "the analysis of the elastic p - d reaction is extended up to @xmath5 mev , covering the region where coulomb effects are expected to be important .",
    "the large amount of accurate experimental data allows for interesting comparisons .",
    "it should be noted that , at present , the analysis of the polarization data at energies above the dbt has been done mainly by comparing n - d calculations to p - d data  @xcite .",
    "differential cross section and vector analyzing power data exist for both n - d and p - d scattering , allowing for an estimate of the coulomb effects .",
    "conversely , no n - d data are available for the deuteron analyzing powers @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "these quantities are evaluated from experiments using a polarized deuteron beam on unpolarized proton targets .",
    "the inverse experiment of unpolarized proton or neutron beams on a polarized deuteron target seems to be extremely difficult at low energies and has not yet been done .",
    "experiments using charged particles are certainly easier to perform and show smaller error bars than those using a neutral beam . on the other hand , the theoretical description of collisions with more than one charged particle in the final state has represented a difficult problem for many years . in a recent work a complete solution of the reaction e@xmath10 + h @xmath11 h@xmath12 + e@xmath10 + e@xmath10 has been obtained by rescigno _",
    "_  @xcite by transforming the schrdinger equation using the so - called exterior complex scaling and making use of supercomputers to solve the associated equations numerically .",
    "this was the first complete solution of a three - body collision with all the charged particles moving away from each other in the final state . regarding the p - d reaction ,",
    "different techniques have been applied so far .",
    "the faddeev equations in momentum space have been adapted to take into account the long - range coulomb interaction using the screening and renormalization approach  @xcite .",
    "recently , a detailed comparison between the solutions of the faddeev equations in configuration space and the kvp has been performed , though restricted to energies below the dbt  @xcite . in the present work we turn our attention to describing p - d elastic observables above the dbt . in this case",
    "the application of the kvp is feasible and the calculation of the elastic @xmath1-matrix does not require large computational devices .",
    "the study of the three - nucleon ( 3n ) continuum provides important information about the capability of modern nn potentials to describe the three - nucleon dynamics . at present",
    ", a few realistic nn potentials are available that reproduce a large set of two - nucleon ( 2n ) data with @xmath13 ( per datum ) .",
    "they are substantially equivalent in reproducing all the details of the nn scattering , but in the description of nuclear systems with @xmath14 differences appear .",
    "in addition , the three - nucleon system is the simplest one in which three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) effects can be studied . the first signal for the necessity of a 3nf comes from the underbinding of the triton when",
    "only nn forces are used .",
    "widely used 3nf models are based on the exchange of two pions with an intermediate @xmath15 excitation . in general these models",
    "include a certain numbers of parameters which are not precisely determined by theory , so some of them can be taken as free parameters in order to reproduce , for example , the triton or @xmath16he binding energy . as a consequence , other observables which scale with the three - nucleon binding energy",
    "improve as well .",
    "examples are the bound state r.m.s radii and the zero energy total cross section in n - d and n-@xmath16h scattering . on the contrary",
    ", vector and tensor n - d analyzing powers do not present such a scaling .",
    "accurate measurements of p - d observables below the dbt , have been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the theoretical predictions to these data shows an underprediction of the deuteron vector analyzing power @xmath6 by @xmath17%  @xcite .",
    "a similar discrepancy had been observed earlier in the neutron analyzing power @xmath18 , a problem which is usually known as the @xmath18 puzzle  @xcite . as the energy increases the observed discrepancies in @xmath18 and @xmath6",
    "reduce and tend to disappear , though not completely , above @xmath19 mev  @xcite . accordingly , the study of these observables over the energy region considered here is important for understanding such a behavior .",
    "accurate 3n and 4n scattering wave functions are necessary for calculating a number of nuclear reactions .",
    "the technique used in the present work is based on the expansion of the wave function in terms of jastrow type correlated hyperspherical harmonic ( chh ) basis functions .",
    "when the correlation factor reduces to a pair correlation function the pair correlated hyperspherical harmonic ( phh ) basis is obtained .",
    "the chh and phh bases have been used to calculate the bound states of the @xmath20 nuclei  @xcite , n - d scattering  @xcite , and p-@xmath16he and n-@xmath16h scattering  @xcite at energies below the three - body fragmentation .",
    "moreover , wave functions obtained through those expansions have recently been used to study the radiative capture @xmath21 below the dbt  @xcite and the hep process , namely the weak capture @xmath22 at the gamow peak  @xcite .",
    "these two reactions have considerable astrophysical relevance .",
    "the former is the second reaction in the @xmath23 solar chain and has a prominent role in the evolution of protostars whereas the hep process plays an important role in the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the calculation of the p - d wave functions above the dbt will provide the input for further studies of radiative capture and photo and electrodisintegration of @xmath16he .",
    "in the present paper we present the results obtained for the differential and total breakup cross sections , nucleon analyzing powers @xmath18 and deuteron analyzing powers @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for n - d scattering at different energies .",
    "the calculations have been done using the two - nucleon av18 potential  @xcite with and without the three - nucleon urix force  @xcite .",

    "the highest energy considered here is @xmath31 mev ( @xmath5 mev ) at which the deuteron analyzing powers are available  @xcite . just above the dbt , deuteron vector and tensor analyzing powers are available at @xmath2 mev  @xcite .",

    "in the literature several investigations regarding the validity of the kvp above the dbt can be found , starting with the works of nuttall  @xcite and merkuriev  @xcite , where the discussion , however , was limited to the n - d reaction .",
    "the first extensive demonstration of the applicability of the principle to the p - d collision has been given in ref .",
    "the main result derived in  @xcite is that the effect of the coulomb interaction can be taken into account in such a way that the form of the principle remains unchanged when the energy goes from below to above the dbt . below the dbt",

    "both the real and imaginary parts are shown .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the splitting in the real part of the phases with equal spin @xmath1 and angular momentum @xmath63 but different @xmath77 , increases with energy .",
    "conversely , the imaginary parts of the phases , which are related to the inelasticity of a state with a given value of @xmath77 , reveal a tiny splitting . after summing all the contributions ,",
    "the total breakup cross section can be obtained , as is discussed in the next section .",
    "the calculation of scattering observables using the present variational technique is based on the estimate of the elastic @xmath1-matrix for all states with @xmath200 . each observable",
    "is obtained from a trace operation after the evaluation of the transition matrix , following the formalism of seyler  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath201 has been chosen by requiring that partial waves with @xmath202 give negligible contributions to all the observables considered . in the present work results for cross sections , vector and tensor analyzing powers up to @xmath5 mev are presented , and correspondingly the value @xmath203 has been found to be appropriate .",
    "let us start with the analysis of the p - d cross sections . for p - d scattering the total breakup cross section accounts for all possible configurations in which all three particles are moving away from each other .",
    "its expression can be given in terms of the elastic @xmath1-matrix  @xcite ,    @xmath204    where @xmath205 ( @xmath141 is the nucleon - deuteron reduced mass ) and @xmath206 is the @xmath207 identity matrix , except for @xmath208 which is the @xmath209 identity matrix .",
    "the quantity @xmath210 is the elastic @xmath1-matrix for the state @xmath77 .",
    "the sum runs over all possible values of @xmath77 and parity ( the sum over the two parities is implied ) . in principle",
    "the sum runs from @xmath211 to infinity , but there is a rapid convergence since each @xmath210 matrix becomes closer to unitary as @xmath77 increases . in fig.2 the theoretical prediction for @xmath212 is given together with the two sets of data available in the literature .",
    "the first data set corresponds to energies just above the dbt  @xcite whereas the second starts at 20 mev  @xcite .",
    "the solid line is the av18 prediction and is found to be in reasonable agreement with both sets of data .",
    "the inclusion of the urix potential does not produce appreciable modifications and both results , with and without the inclusion of the 3nf , nearly coincide .",
    "the low sensitivity to the 3nf can be understood by noticing that the contribution to @xmath213 comes from a balance between the spin factor @xmath214 and the quantity @xmath215 which can be considered as a measurement of the inelasticity of the state ( divided by @xmath216 ) . above @xmath24 mev the state @xmath217 gives by far the main contribution to the observable  @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath192 , which is appreciably modified by the 3nf , has the largest inelasticity , but due to a small spin factor it gives a contribution of the same order as other states that are much less `` inelastic '' and modified slightly by the 3nf . the final result after summing up all these contributions is that the small ( but sizeable ) effect of the 3nf on @xmath218 has no impact in @xmath213 .    regarding the elastic p - d differential cross section ,",
    "a huge amount of high quality data has been collected during the past years .",
    "low energy measurements have been taken recently at tunl at different energy values below @xmath219 mev  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the quality in the description of these data has been performed using the av18 and the av18+urix interactions  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that 3nf effects can be revealed through a @xmath220 analysis of the data .",
    "essentially these effects are related to a correct description of the @xmath16he binding energy .",
    "in fact , using the av18+urix interaction it is possible to describe the p - d differential cross section at @xmath219 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 mev with a @xmath220 per datum ( @xmath223 ) close to one .",
    "this value increases significantly when the av18 potential is considered alone .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical and experimental differential cross section worsens , though not dramatically , as the energy increases .",
    "for example , at @xmath224 mev a value of @xmath225 @xmath226 was recently obtained with ( without ) the inclusion of a 3nf  @xcite .",
    "again the inclusion of a 3nf reduces the @xmath220 per datum considerably .",
    "the results obtained for the p - d differential cross section are given in fig.3 for nine values of the energy , @xmath227 mev .",
    "for each energy three curves are shown corresponding to calculations using the av18 potential ( solid line ) , the av18+urix potential ( dotted line ) , and calculations for n - d scattering using the av18 potential ( dashed line ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions are compared to the experimental data of refs .",
    "@xcite , with the exception of the calculations at @xmath187 mev which are compared to data obtained at a slightly different energy ( @xmath228 mev ) .",
    "the analysis of the results at the different energies shows that 3nf effects are small in this energy range and the av18 and av18+urix curves practically overlap each other .",
    "a more quantitative analysis at @xmath229 mev gives @xmath230 using the av18 interaction and nearly the same value for av18+urix .",
    "coulomb effects are mainly observed at forward and backward angles whilst they are strongly reduced at the minimum .",
    "tiny coulomb effects at the minimum are confirmed by comparing n - d to p - d data , as can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as far as the agreement between theory and experiment is concerned , the situation for the differential cross section above the dbt is different when compared to what has been observed below the dbt .",
    "as mentioned before , at very low energies the differential cross section can be described with @xmath231 using av18+urix , while when the av18 is used alone a substantially worse result , @xmath232 , is obtained .",
    "in fact , the av18 curve remains above the data points all over the angular distribution .",
    "as the energy increases the tendency for the av18 curve is to go below the data at the minimum .",
    "this problem is appreciable already at @xmath233 mev , as can be seen in the last panel of fig.3 .",
    "around 20 mev the av18+urix curve starts to rise above the av18 curve and closer to the data .",
    "this effect is clearly shown in ref .",
    "faddeev calculations using several nn and 3nf interactions have been compared to the data at @xmath222 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 mev . in the energy range analyzed here",
    "we observe that there is one energy , around 18 mev , where the av18 and av18+urix curves mostly overlap . in order to analyze further this behavior , in table",
    "ii , the values at the minimum of the p - d cross section calculated with av18 and av18+urix are compared to the data .",
    "the corresponding values of the av18 n - d cross section are also given in order to have a quantitative idea of the size of the coulomb effects .",
    "the vector and tensor analyzing powers are examples of polarization observables .",
    "there is a large amount of p - d and d - p data for the vector analyzing powers @xmath18 and @xmath6 as well as for the tensor analyzing powers @xmath237 .",
    "the study of these observables is important because they are sensible to the non - central terms of the nuclear interaction .",
    "these terms are responsible for small components in the wave function which in general are less known .",
    "therefore , the accuracy shown by the modern interactions when reproducing the vector and tensor analyzing powers in the three - nucleon system gives important information about parts of the nuclear interaction not completely under control .",
    "as is well known , in the low energy region the vector analyzing powers are heavily underpredicted by all modern nn interactions and the origin of this discrepancy is not yet completely understood .",
    "possible ways for solving this puzzle have recently been investigated , based on the inclusion of new terms in the three - nucleon potential  @xcite or on a new nn potential obtained from chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "these studies represent only a first step in the understanding of the puzzle and further investigations and refinements of the models are needed .",
    "a similar underprediction of the proton analyzing power @xmath18 has been found in calculations on p-@xmath16he scattering , as was recently pointed out  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a solution to the puzzle should concern both the 3n and 4n systems .    in the present paper",
    ", we will discuss the quality of the description of the vector and tensor polarization observables achieved by the av18 and the av18+urix interactions in p - d scattering up to @xmath233 mev . in fig.4",
    "the results for @xmath18 are given for the same nine energy values given in fig.3 .",
    "the three curves correspond to the p - d @xmath18 calculated using av18 ( solid line ) and av18+urix ( dotted line ) , and the n - d @xmath18 calculated using av18 ( dashed line ) .",

    "the order of magnitude of these effects is @xmath241% . instead",
    ", 3nf effects are not so important .",
    "this is a characteristic of the urbana potential that modifies the quartet @xmath193-waves ( which produces the main contribution to @xmath18 below @xmath19 mev ) in such a way that there is a cancellation among the different contributions , so the global effect on the observable is small .",
    "a similar analysis holds for @xmath6 , shown in fig.5 , since these two observables have rather similar structures .",

    ", we observed that coulomb and 3nf effects are of the same size at the minimum of @xmath6 above @xmath187 mev .    in figs.6 - 8 the tensor observables @xmath237",
    "are given , respectively .",
    "as before , the three curves correspond to the p - d @xmath244 calculated using av18 ( solid line ) and av18+urix ( dotted line ) , and the n - d @xmath244 calculated using av18 ( dashed line ) .",

    "@xcite at @xmath242 mev , from ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath243 mev and from ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath5 mev . as a general trend ,",
    "the agreement with the data for the tensor observables is better than for the vector observables .",
    "coulomb effects are appreciable in the three observables at low energies .",
    "as the energy increases the inclusion of the coulomb interaction in the analysis of the tensor observables is less important , mostly for @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "the case of @xmath8 is of particular interest since coulomb effects are still appreciable at @xmath233 mev .",
    "this observation suggests that comparisons of d - p data to calculations where the coulomb interaction has been neglected should be done with caution .",
    "the effect of the 3nf is somehow contradictory since in some cases its inclusion improves the description of the observables but in other cases it does not .",
    "for example , a net improvement is obtained in the description of the minimum of @xmath9 below 12 mev .",
    "also the maximum of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is better described with the av18+ur potential .",
    "conversely the description of the minimum of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is better described by the av18 potential alone .",
    "the case of @xmath8 is again of interest since 3nf effects seem to be bigger in this tensor observable than in the others .",
    "unfortunately experimental data for @xmath8 are not available at all the energies .    in order to give a quantitative estimation of the agreement between the theoretical calculations and the measurements ,",
    "the @xmath223 for the polarization observables is presented in table iii . in the first row of the table ,",
    "the @xmath223 is given with respect to a recent measurement performed at 1 mev  @xcite and in the second row with respect to the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath245 mev .",
    "these two energies are below the dbt and are useful for analyzing the trend of @xmath220 starting at low energies . by inspection of the table ,",
    "the manifestation of the @xmath18 puzzle is evident since the @xmath223 for the vector observables is a few hundreds at low energy .",
    "above @xmath240 mev @xmath18 and @xmath6 change shape being closer to the shape of @xmath8 with a pronounced minimum followed by a maximum .",
    "after that energy the values of @xmath223 decrease in such a way that , at the last energy , vector and tensor observables have similar values which are of the order of one tenth .",
    "these final values are comparable to those ones obtained recently in ref .",
    "@xcite at 135 mev .",
    "in the present paper we have studied p - d elastic scattering above the dbt , up to @xmath5 mev . the differential cross section and the total breakup cross section as well as the vector and tensor analyzing powers have been calculated using one of the modern nn interactions , namely the av18 potential . in order to evaluate 3nf effects",
    "the three - nucleon potential of urbana has been taken into account .",
    "the effects of the coulomb interaction has been considered in the framework of the complex kohn variational principle .",
    "the internal part of the p - d scattering wave function has been expanded in terms of the phh basis .",
    "the kvp has been applied to obtain a set of differential equations for the hyperradial functions .",
    "the set has been solved imposing outgoing boundary conditions at a certain value of the hyperradius @xmath148 and expanding the hyperradial functions in the region @xmath246 $ ] in laguerre polynomials plus an auxiliary oscillating function .",
    "the solution should not depend on the value of @xmath147 providing that for @xmath167 the asymptotic behavior has been reached .",
    "such a technique has proved to be adequate since the results from ref .",
    "@xcite has been reproduced as well as the benchmark of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculations have been extended to all states and parities with @xmath247 , corresponding to nine energies up to @xmath5 mev .",
    "the elastic @xmath1-matrix has then been used to calculate the observables of interest and compare them to the data . moreover",
    ", the corresponding observables for n - d scattering , where the coulomb interaction is absent , have been calculated too . from the analysis of the results",
    "some conclusions can be drawn about the capability of the av18 and av18+urix interactions to reproduce the data .",
    "a quantitative measure of the agreement achieved by the theory in the description of the data has been given through a @xmath220 analysis .",
    "no appreciable 3nf effects have been observed in the total breakup cross section and small effects appear in the differential cross section .",
    "however , results using the av18+urix model produce a lower @xmath223 value than those where the av18 interaction has been used alone . at low energies",
    "this is a manifestation of the correct description of the @xmath16he binding energy by the av18+urix interaction .",
    "but as the energy increases , there is a different sensitivity to the 3nf . in particular , at the highest energy considered , @xmath5 mev , the av18+urix differential cross section is above the av18 differential cross section , reversing the order observed at lower energies .",
    "this situation becomes much more evident for example at @xmath248 mev  @xcite . in order to further analyze this behavior in table ii the minimum of the av18 and av18+urix cross sections",
    "are compared to the data .",
    "the minimum of the n - d differential cross section calculated with the av18 potential is also given in order to estimate coulomb effects .",
    "the results of the table are useful for analyzing what has been called the `` sagara discrepancy ''  @xcite .    in the case of vector and tensor",
    "analyzing powers the urbana 3nf has little impact below @xmath19 mev .",
    "the centrifugal barrier is still strong and there is not too much sensitivity to the short range part of the interaction .",
    "conversely there are important coulomb effects . in order to improve the description of the vector analyzing powers new terms",
    "could be considered in the three - nucleon potential .",
    "in such a case both the vector and the tensor analyzing powers should improve as well .",
    "the present picture of the 3n scattering from the theoretical point of view is the following . at low energies",
    "there is a large underprediction of the vector analyzing powers whereas the differential cross section and tensor analyzing powers are well described . up to @xmath19 mev",
    "we see an improvement in @xmath18 and @xmath6 indicating that the @xmath18 puzzle is a low energy problem . on the other hand , a progressive deterioration in the description of the cross section and tensor observables",
    "is revealed through a @xmath220 analysis . for energies above @xmath19",
    "mev we can refer to the very recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite and we see that this picture remains essentially the same up to very high energies ( around @xmath235 mev ) . above this energy",
    "a number of new conflicts appears .    at present",
    "a few realistic local and non - local nn interactions have been determined by accurately fitting the two nucleon scattering observables .",
    "all of them give rise to the @xmath18 puzzle in the three - nucleon system .",
    "it seems difficult to derive a new nn interaction , which still accurately fits the two - nucleon scattering , and correctly describes the n - d @xmath18 at low energies  @xcite .",
    "so , if this is the case , a possible solution to the puzzle should come from an improvement of the currently used 3nf models .",
    "indeed , in accordance with chiral perturbation theory , these 3nf s include those terms of larger magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath18 puzzle can be solved by rather small changes in certain p - wave phase - shifts , which can be obtained by adding a small term to the three - nucleon potential  @xcite . however , as the energy increases other discrepancies arise in the polarization observables that could have different origins .",
    "hence , since the three - nucleon continuum can be calculated at present with great accuracy , it is reasonable to expect that the actual 3nf models can be adjusted to describe the 3n data .",
    "the necessary calculations will require large computing time , but is our opinion that this project will certainly help to understand the long unsolved problems in low energy nuclear physics .",
