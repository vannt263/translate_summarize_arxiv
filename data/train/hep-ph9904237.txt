    "in recent years , there has been a renaissance of interest in diffractive scattering .",
    "these diffractive processes are described by the regge theory in terms of the pomeron ( @xmath0 ) exchange@xcite .",
    "the pomeron carries quantum numbers of the vacuum , so it is a colorless entity in qcd language , which may lead to the  rapidity gap \" events in experiments .",
    "however , the nature of pomeron and its reaction with hadrons remain a mystery . for a long time",
    "it had been understood that the dynamics of the `` soft pomeron '' is deeply tied to confinement .",
    "however , it has been realized now that how much can be learned about qcd from the wide variety of small-@xmath1 and hard diffractive processes , which are now under study experimentally . in refs.@xcite , the diffractive @xmath2 and @xmath3 production cross section",
    "have been formulated in photoproduction processes and in dis processes in perturbative qcd . in the framework of perturbative qcd the pomeron",
    "is represented by a pair of gluon in the color - singlet sate .",
    "this two - gluon exchange model can successfully describe the experimental results from hera@xcite .    on the other hand , as we know that there exist nonfactorization effects in the hard diffractive processes at hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "first , there is the so - called spectator effect@xcite , which can change the probability of the diffractive hadron emerging from collisions intact .",
    "practically , a suppression factor ( or survive factor ) ",
    "@xmath4 \" is used to describe this effect@xcite .",
    "obviously , this suppression factor can not be calculated in perturbative qcd , which is now viewed as a nonperturbative parameter .",
    "typically , the suppression factor @xmath4 is determined to be about @xmath5 at the energy scale of the fermilab tevatron@xcite .",
    "another nonfactorization effect discussed in literature is associated with the coherent diffractive processes at hadron colliders@xcite , in which the whole pomeron is induced in the hard scattering .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that the existence of the leading twist coherent diffractive processes is associated with a breakdown of the qcd factorization theorem .",
    "based on the success of the two - gluon exchange parametrization of the pomeron model in the description of the diffractive photoproduction processes at @xmath6 colliders@xcite , we may extend the applications of this model to calculate the diffractive processes at hadron colliders in perturbative qcd . under this context",
    ", the pomeron represented by a color - singlet two - gluon system emits from one hadron and interacts with another hadron in hard process , in which the two gluons are both involved ( as shown in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the partonic process is plotted in fig.2 , where there are nine diagrams in the leading order of perturbative qcd .",
    "therefore , these processes calculated in the two - gluon exchange model are just belong to the coherent diffractive processes in hadron collisions .",
    "another important feature of the calculations of the diffractive processes in this model recently demonstrated is the sensitivity to the off - diagonal parton distribution function in the proton@xcite .    using this two - gluon exchange model ,",
    "we have calculated the diffractive @xmath2 production @xcite , charm jet production@xcite , massive muon pair and @xmath7 boson productions@xcite in hadron collisions .",
    "these calculations show that we can explore much low @xmath1 ( off - diagonal ) gluon distribution function and study the coherent diffractive processes at hadron colliders through these processes . in this paper",
    ", we will calculate the light quark ( massless ) jet production at large transverse momentum in the coherent diffractive processes at hadron colliders by using the two - gluon exchange model . in the calculations of refs.@xcite",
    ", there always is a large mass scale associated with the production process . that is @xmath8 for @xmath2 production , @xmath9 for the charm jet production , @xmath10 for the massive muon production ( @xmath10 is the invariant mass of the muon pair ) and @xmath11 for @xmath7 boson production .",
    "however , in the light quark jet production process , there is no large mass scale .",
    "so , for the light quark jet production , the large transverse momentum is needed to guarantee the application of the perturbative qcd .",
    "furthermore , the experience on the calculations of the diffractive di - quark photoproduction@xcite shows that the light quark jet production in the two - gluon exchange model has a distinctive feature that there is no contribution from the small @xmath12 region ( @xmath13 ) in the integration of the amplitude over @xmath12 .",
    "so , the expansion ( in terms of @xmath14 ) method used in refs.@xcite can not be applied to the calculations of light quark jet production . in the following calculations",
    ", we will employ the helicity amplitude method to calculate the amplitude of the diffractive light quark jet production in hadron collisions .",
    "we will show that the production cross section is related to the differential ( off - diagonal ) gluon distribution function in the proton as that in the diffractive di - quark jet photoprodution process@xcite .",
    "( on the other hand , we note that the cross sections of the processes calculated in refs.@xcite are related to the integrated gluon distribution function in the proton ) .",
    "the diffractive production of heavy quark jet at hadron colliders has also been studied by using the two - gluon exchange model in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , their calculation method is very different from ours . in their calculations , they separated their diagrams into two parts , and called one part the coherent diffractive contribution to the heavy quark production .",
    "however , this separation can not guarantee the gauge invariance@xcite . in our approach ,",
    "we follow the definition of ref.@xcite , i.e. , we call the process in which the whole pomeron participants in the hard scattering process as the coherent diffractive process . under this definition , all of the diagrams plotted in fig.2 for the partonic process @xmath15 contribute to the coherent diffractive production .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we will give the cross section formula for the partonic process @xmath16 in the leading order of perturbative qcd , where we employ the helicity amplitude method to calculate the amplitude for this process . in sec.iii",
    ", we use this helicity amplitude method to recalculate the diffractive charm jet production process @xmath17 , by which we will reproduce the leading logarithmic approximation result for this process previously calculated in ref.@xcite . in sec.iv",
    ", we will estimate the production rate of diffractive light quark jet at the fermilab tevatron by approximating the off - diagonal gluon distribution function by the usual diagonal gluon distribution function in the proton . and",
    "the conclusions will be given in sec.v .",
    "for the partonic process @xmath15 , in the leading order of perturbative qcd , there are nine diagrams shown in fig.2 .",
    "the two - gluon system coupled to the proton ( antiproton ) in fig.2 is in a color - singlet state , which characterizes the diffractive processes in perturbative qcd . due to the positive signature of these diagrams ( color - singlet exchange ) , we know that the real part of the amplitude cancels out in the leading logarithmic approximation . to get the imaginary part of the amplitude",
    ", we must calculate the discontinuity represented by the crosses in each diagram of fig.2 .",
    "the first four diagrams of fig.2 are the same as those calculated in the diffractive photoproduction processes .",
    "but , due to the existence of gluon - gluon interaction vertex in qcd , in the partonic process @xmath16 , there are additional five diagrams ( fig.2(5)-(9 ) ) .",
    "these five diagrams are needed for complete calculations in this order of qcd .    in our calculations ,",
    "we express the formulas in terms of the sudakov variables .",
    "that is , every four - momenta @xmath18 are decomposed as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the momenta of the incident gluon and the proton , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the c.m .",
    "energy of the gluon - proton system , i.e. , the invariant mass of the partonic process @xmath16 . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the momentum fractions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "@xmath28 is the transverse momentum , which satisfies @xmath29    all of the sudakov variables for every momentum are determined by using the on - shell conditions of the momenta represented by the external lines and the crossed lines in the diagram .",
    "the calculations of these sudakov variables are similar to those in the diffractive charm jet production process @xmath17 . and all of these sudakov variables for the process @xmath15 of the light quark jet production can take their values from the corresponding formulas in ref.@xcite after taking @xmath30 . for convenience , we list all of the sudakov variables for the diffractive process @xmath15 in the following .    for the momentum @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the invariant mass squared of the diffractive final state including the light quark and antiquark jets . for the high energy diffractive process , we know that @xmath34 , so we have @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) as a small parameter . for the momentum @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the transverse momentum of the out going quark jet . for the loop mentum @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath41    using these sudakov variables , we can give the cross section formula for the partonic process @xmath16 as , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the amplitude of the process @xmath15 .",
    "we know that the real part of the amplitude @xmath43 is zero , and the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath44 for each diagram of fig.2 has the following general form , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the color factor for each diagram , and is the same as that for the @xmath17 process@xcite .",
    "@xmath47 is the color index of the incident gluon .",
    "@xmath48 represents some @xmath49 matrices including one propagator .",
    "@xmath50 in the integral is defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 where the function @xmath53 is the so - called off - diagonal gluon distribution function@xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are the momentum fractions of the proton carried by the two gluons .",
    "it is expected that at small @xmath1 , there is no big difference between the off - diagonal and the usual diagonal gluon densities@xcite .",
    "so , in the following calculations , we estimate the production rate by approximating the off - diagonal gluon density by the usual diagonal gluon density , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .    in ref.@xcite , we calculate the amplitude ( [ i m a ] ) for the heavy quark diffractive production processes by expanding @xmath48 in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "however , in the light quark jet production process @xmath15 , the expansion method is not yet valid . according to the result of @xcite ,",
    "the production cross section is proportional to the heavy quark mass .",
    "if we apply this formula to the light quark jet production , the cross section will be zero .",
    "that is to say , the expansion of the amplitude in terms of @xmath12 , in which the large logarithmic contribution comes from the region of @xmath58 , is not further suitable for the calculation of the cross section for massless light quark jet production .",
    "furthermore , the experience of the calculation of the diffractive light quark jet photoproduction process @xmath59 ( for @xmath60 ) @xcite indicates that there is no contribution from the region of @xmath61 in the integration of the amplitude over @xmath12 . in the hadroproduction process @xmath15",
    ", the situation is the same .",
    "so , the expansion method , in which @xmath12 is taken as a small parameter , is not valid for the calculations of the massless quark production processes .    in the following ,",
    "we employ the helicity amplitude method@xcite to calculate the amplitude eq.([ima ] ) . for the massless quark spinors",
    ", we define @xmath62 for the polarization vector of the incident gluon , which is transversely polarized , we choose , @xmath63 the helicity amplitudes for the processes in which the polarized dirac particles are involved have the following general forms@xcite , @xmath64 }          { 4\\sqrt{(n\\cdot p_i)(n\\cdot p_f)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is an arbitrary massless 4-vector , which is set to be @xmath66 in the following calculations . using this formula ( [ ham ] ) , the calculations of the helicity amplitude @xmath67 for the diffractive process @xmath16 is straightforward . here @xmath68 are the corresponding helicities of the external gluon , quark and antiquark . in our calculations , we only take the leading order contribution , and neglect the higher order contributions which are proportional to @xmath69 because in the high energy diffractive processes we have @xmath70 .    for the first four diagrams , to sum up together ,",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the color factors for diag.1,4 and diag.2,3 respectively , and @xmath75 is defined as @xmath76 the other helicity amplitudes for the first four diagrams have the similar form as ( [ im1 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude expression eq .",
    "( [ im1 ] ) is the same as that for the photoproduction process @xmath77 previously calculated in refs.@xcite except the difference on the color factors . in the diffractive photoproduction process ,",
    "the color factors of these four diagrams are the same ( they are all @xmath73 ) , while in hadroproduction process the color factors are no longer the same for these four diagrams .",
    "it is instructive to see what is the consequence of this difference .",
    "we know that the amplitude of the diffractive process in eq .",
    "( [ i m a ] ) must be zero in the limit @xmath78 .",
    "otherwise , this will lead to a linear singularity when we perform the integration of the amplitude over @xmath12 due to existence of the factor @xmath79 in the integral of eq .",
    "( [ ima])@xcite .",
    "this linear singularity is not proper in qcd calculations .",
    "so , we must first exam the amplitude behavior under the limit of @xmath78 for all the diffractive processes in the calculations using the two - gluon exchange model . from eq .",
    "( [ im1 ] ) , we can see that the amplitude for the diffractive photoproduction of di - quark jet process is exact zero at @xmath78 .",
    "however , for the diffractive hadroproduction process @xmath15 the amplitude for the first four diagrams is not exact zero in the limit @xmath78 due to the inequality of the color factors between them .",
    "so , for @xmath15 process there must be other diagrams in this order of perturbative qcd calculation to cancel out the linear singularity which rises from the first four diagrams .",
    "the last five diagrams of fig.2 are just for this purpose .",
    "for example , the contributions from diags.5 and 8 are @xmath80 and the contributions from diags.6 and 9 are @xmath81 and the contribution from diag.7 is @xmath82 from the above results , we can see that the contributions from diags.5 - 9 just cancel out the linear singularity which rises from the first four diagrams .",
    "their total sum from the nine diagrams of fig.2 is free of linear singularity now .    finally , by adding up all of the nine diagrams of fig.2 , the imaginary parts of the amplitudes for the following helicity sets are , @xmath83 where @xmath84.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the amplitudes for the other helicity sets are zero in the light quark jet production process .",
    "from the above results , we can see that in the integration of the amplitude the linear singularity from different diagrams are canceled out by each other , which will guarantee there is no linear singularity in the total sum .",
    "another feature of the above results for the amplitudes is the relation to the differential off - diagonal gluon distribution function @xmath85 . to get the cross section for the diffractive process",
    ", we must perform the integration of eq .",
    "( [ int2 ] ) . however , as mentioned above that there is no big difference between the off - diagonal gluon distribution function and the usual gluon distribution at small @xmath1 , so we can simplify the integration of ( [ int2 ] ) by approximating the differential off - diagonal gluon distribution function @xmath85 by the usual diagonal differential gluon distribution function @xmath86 .    after integrating over the azimuth angle of @xmath87 , the integration @xmath88",

    "<S> massless quark and antiquark jet production at large transverse momentum in the coherent diffractive processes at hadron colliders is calculated in the two - gluon exchange parametrization of the pomeron model . </S>",
    "<S> we use the helicity amplitude method to calculate the cross section formula . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for the light quark jet production the diffractive process is related to the differential off - diagonal gluon distribution function in the proton . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the production rate for this process at the fermilab tevatron by approximating the off - diagonal gluon distribution function by the usual diagonal gluon distribution in the proton . </S>",
    "<S> and we find that the cross sections for the diffractive light quark jet production and the charm quark jet production are in the same order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the helicity amplitude method to calculate the diffractive charm jet production at hadron colliders , by which we reproduce the leading logarithmic approximation result of this process we previously calculated . </S>"
