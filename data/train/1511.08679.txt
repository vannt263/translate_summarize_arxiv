    "exoplanetary system architectures have revealed numerous surprises since the first exoplanets were discovered .",
    "one of the earliest surprises was the discovery of exoplanets in highly eccentric orbits , for which there is no analog in the solar system .",
    "these eccentric orbits were discovered for giant planets , such as hd  114762b @xcite and 70  vir  b @xcite with eccentricities of 0.33 and 0.40 respectively . since those early discoveries ,",
    "eccentric planets have presented a significant challenge for formation theories to account for the components of planet - planet scattering @xcite and tidal circularization @xcite .",
    "such planets tend to be discovered with the radial velocity ( rv ) technique since the observations are able to sample the entire keplerian planetary orbit .",
    "subsequent investigations of the eccentricity distribution of planetary orbits that take _ kepler _ transiting exoplanet discoveries into account show that small planets in multi - planet systems are more likely to have low eccentricities @xcite .",
    "the discovery and characterization of eccentric orbits is an on - going effort to understand the evolutionary history of these fascinating systems .",
    "a particularly eccentric exoplanet was discovered by @xcite orbiting the star hd  20782 . with a minimum mass",
    "twice that of jupiter and an orbital period of 597  days , the planet is typical of high - eccentricity planets .",
    "the orbit was further revised by @xcite and shown to have an eccentricity as high as 0.97 , making it the highest eccentricity exoplanet yet discovered .",
    "however , data during periastron passage is difficult to obtain for such systems since the rv variation predominantly occurs during a very small fraction of the orbital phase .",
    "the star continued to be monitored by the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) to improve the orbital parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "such orbital refinement may be used to predict and observe events that occur during particular periods of the orbit , such as planetary transits @xcite or phase variations @xcite .    here",
    "we present new results for the hd  20782 system , including rvs that sample several periastron passages and establish the planet as the most eccentric known exoplanet .",
    "follow - up photometry from both ground - based and space - based telescopes rule out a transit of the planet and show evidence of phase variations due to reflected light from the planet close to periastron passage .",
    "section  [ science ] provides background information and discusses the science motivation for studying the system .",
    "section  [ stellarprop ] presents analysis of new chiron spectra and the resulting fundamental parameters of the host star as well as stellar abundances .",
    "new rv data are combined with those published in section  [ orbit ] and a new keplerian orbit for the planet is produced .",
    "section  [ astrometry ] describes the use of _ hipparcos _ astrometry to constrain the orbital inclination of the planet .",
    "section  [ transit ] discusses the transit prospects for the system and the effects of both orbital eccentricity and inclination .",
    "section  [ photometry ] presents the ground - based photometry and an estimate of the stellar rotation period .",
    "data from most are used during the transit / periastron window to rule out a transit and also reveal the potential presence of a reflected light signature of the planet as it passes through periastron passage .",
    "we discuss future observing opportunities and make concluding remarks in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets has a well - defined shape whereby the orbits diverge from circular beyond a semi - major axis of @xmath1  au @xcite , inside of which tidal circularization tends to force low eccentricity @xcite .",
    "the observed eccentricity distribution is a clear indicator of formation processes that are dependent upon initial system architectures , in particular planet - planet scattering .",
    "wide binaries may inadvertantly create a more suitable environment for the formation of highly - eccentric planetary orbits through gravitational perturbations from the companion star and the triggering of planetary ejections @xcite .    .",
    "the orbits of the solar system planets ( dashed lines ) are shown for comparison.,width=321 ]    hd  20782 is part of a wide binary with hd  20781 having a projected separation of 9,000  au , recently described by @xcite .",
    "the known planet orbiting hd  20782 lies at the very top of the exoplanet eccentricity distribution , though rv measurements during the crucial periastron passage were relatively rare .",
    "the extreme nature of the planet s orbital eccentricity may be seen in figure  [ orbitfig ] , where the orbit is described using our expanded dataset ( see section  [ orbit ] ) .",
    "our further investigations of this system are primarily motivated by a better characterization of the planetary orbit and performing follow - up observations at key orbital phases that can help to understand the nature of the planet .",
    "it is also important to establish that the secondary object is indeed a planet since a face - on orbital orientation would make it consistent with the eccentricity distribution of spectroscopic binaries @xcite .",
    "the orbital orientation depicted in figure  [ orbitfig ] shows that the star ",
    "planet separation along the line of sight to the observer is quite small , despite the @xmath218 month orbital period .",
    "this yields a relatively high transit probability equivalent to that of a hot jupiter ( see section  [ transit ] ) .",
    "thus a primary motivation for follow - up observations is the possible detection of a planetary transit for a long - period eccentric planet @xcite .",
    "a previous example of such a system can be seen in the case of hd  80606b @xcite , where the secondary eclipse of the 0.93 eccentricity planet was detected by @xcite and later confirmed to also exhibit a primary transit @xcite .",
    "an additional motivation for obtaining high - precision photometry during the transit window and periastron passage for hd  20782b is the possibility of detecting reflected light from the planet since the small star  planet separation will greatly increase the amplitude of the phase signature @xcite .",
    "such a detection would allow an estimate of the geometric albedo of the planet and place constraints upon the atmospheric properties and the atmosphere s radiative and advective time scales @xcite .",
    "note that since the orbital period is 18 months , an observing opportunity for a particular point in the orbit will only arise every 3 years since the star will be largely inaccessible to ground - based observers for each alternate orbit .",
    "a critical step in quantifying the properties of the planet lies in understanding the host star . here",
    "we provide new fundamental parameters and abundances for hd  20782 .",
    "we acquired a high s / n ( 300 second integration ) spectrum of hd  20782 on the night of july 6th , 2014 .",
    "the data were acquired using chiron , a fiber - fed echelle spectrometer @xcite , installed at the 1.5 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "chiron operates at a fixed wavelength range of 415880  nm and a resolution of @xmath3 .",
    "the spectrum was modeled using the spectroscopy made easy ( sme ) package , described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "sme uses an iterative technique that combines model atmosphere analysis with yonsei - yale model isochrones @xcite that utilize _ hipparcos _ photometry and distances @xcite .",
    "this approach produces a self - consistent convergence with the measured surface gravity @xcite .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in table  [ stellar ] , including values for the surface gravity @xmath4 , rotational velocity @xmath5 , atmospheric abundance [ fe / h ] , effective temperature @xmath6 and stellar isochrone solution ( mass @xmath7 , radius @xmath8 , and age ) .",
    "these parameters are consistent with previous estimates of the stellar properties , such as those calculated by @xcite .",
    "the revised parameters demonstrate that hd  20782 is quite similar to the sun , with the mass and radius being crucial properties for the subsequent analysis of the planetary companion in this paper .",

    "however , due to the difference in size and spectral type , the abundances within hd  20782 are easier to determine . while half as many groups have measured hd  20781 than hd  20782 , there does remain some overlap by some , such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who did a more in - depth comparison of the two stars .    per the analysis in the hypatia catalog @xcite ,",
    "the individual abundances within both stars were renormalized to the @xcite solar scale .",
    "the largest measurement discrepancy between datasets , known as the _ spread _ , was used to better quantify the uniformity , or lack thereof , between measurements .",
    "this technique was implemented in the hypatia catalog to better understand the variation in abundances seen when employing different reduction techniques , due to instances where the _ spread _ between groups was larger than associated error . for the cases where variations between groups were small , the median value was used as the ultimate abundance measurement .",
    "the overall median [ fe / h ] content in hd  20781 was 0.1 dex , as compared to 0.15 dex within hd  20782 , where the spread was 0.03 dex and 0.17 dex , respectively .",
    "in other words , the groups that measured hd  20781 , while fewer in number , were in closer agreement regarding the iron abundance than those that measured hd  20782 .",
    "the [ fe / h ] determinations for both stars are disparate compared to the abundances determined by @xcite , which are not part of the hypatia catalog , who measured 0.04@xmath250.03 and -0.02@xmath250.02 , respectively .",
    "these are consistent with our new [ fe / h ] determination shown in table  [ stellar ] .    a wide variety of @xmath26-elements ( carbon , magnesium , silicon , and titanium ) , odd - z elements ( sodium , aluminum , and scandium ) , and iron - peak elements ( vanadium , chromium , cobalt , and nickel ) have been measured for both stars . for all elements except for [ na / fe ]",
    ", the abundance measurements for hd  20781 and hd  20782 were found to be consistent to within error and markedly sub - solar , or @xmath2 -0.1 dex .",
    "the [ na / fe ] content in hd  20782 was found to be @xmath27 more than in the companion hd  20781 , where [ na / fe ] = -0.09@xmath250.06 dex and -0.22@xmath250.04 dex , respectively .",
    "the highly eccentric planet orbiting hd  20782 was first reported in @xcite and updated in @xcite .",
    "we now present a further six years of radial velocity data from the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) .",

    "calibration of the spectrograph point - spread function is achieved using an iodine absorption cell temperature - controlled at 60.0@xmath250.1@xmath29c .",
    "the iodine cell superimposes a forest of narrow absorption lines from 5000 to 6200 , allowing simultaneous calibration of instrumental drifts as well as a precise wavelength reference @xcite .",

    "this was performed using the rvlin package ; a partially linearized , least - squares fitting procedure @xcite . the uncertainties for the orbital and associated physical parameters",
    "were estimated using the boottran bootstrapping routines described in @xcite . to be sure that known instabilities of the levenberg - marquardt - based rvlin algorithm did not prevent convergence at these high eccentricities",
    ", we reduced the number of nonlinear parameters in the problem by fixing the eccentricity at 100 values evenly spaced between 0.93 and 0.995 and selecting the value that produced the minimum @xmath30 fit .",
    "a fit to the aat and paras data with their instrumental uncertainties was unsatisfactory .",
    "the rms residuals to the paras data are 17  ms@xmath15 , with two excursions at and after rv minimum of over 20  ms@xmath15 , inconsistent with typical instrumental uncertainties of under 6  ms@xmath15 .",

    "some component of the scatter about the best fit is due to intrinsic stellar variability , and some is due to the precision of the measurements ( due to both instrumental / algorithmic imprecision and photon noise ) .",

    "however , in both cases the difference in velocities is over 20  ms@xmath15 , and in different directions .",
    "the combined measurement uncertainties of the two instruments therefore must be of order 20  ms@xmath15 .",
    "we attempted a second fit , but inflated both instrumental uncertainties by adding , in quadrature , 5  ms@xmath15 and 19  ms@xmath15 to the aat and paras velocities , respectively .",

    "the astrometric data covers approximately two orbits for this system , so phase coverage should not inhibit the recovery of any significant orbital signatures .",

    "we perform a permutation test to verify the significance of our result by comparing the semimajor axis of the new solution orbit with 1,000 pseudo orbits generated from random permutations of the astrometric data , similar to @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : hist ] illustrates the calculation of a low significance orbit ( 68.2% , which is almost exactly at the 1@xmath32 level of detection ) , confirming that the hipparcos data contains little or no orbital signature . the new hipparcos reduction has this target flagged as having a good fit with just the 5 astrometric parameters , which is consistent with the fact that adding the 7 rv parameters does not seem to change the solution .",
    "@xcite emphasize that orbital solutions at this significance level are prone to very large biases , and the calculated values and their errors should be considered highly suspect .",
    "we present our full set of orbital parameters here only to facilitate future comparison of analytical methods , and not for direct application .         and length given by the residual of the orbital solution connect the measurements with the predicted location from our model .",
    "this illustrates the difficulty of detecting an orbit with such a small projected semi - major axis , given the median hipparcos single - measurement precision on this target.,width=309 ]    on the other hand , simulations by @xcite show that orbits are always detected at the 3@xmath32 level when the semi - major axis is at least 70% of the hipparcos precision on a target .",
    "any orbital signature above 2.45 mas would have been detectable in this hipparcos dataset , and this helps to set an upper limit on the companion mass . using this assertion , we get a lower limit on inclination ( 1.22@xmath64 ) and an upper limit on the companion mass ( 66  @xmath53 ) . although the consideration of astrometric data does not allow us to put tight constraints on the inclination of the system , the non - detection of an orbit allows us to rule out a stellar binary system .",

    "as described in section  [ science ] , one of the most interesting aspects of hd  20782b is the relatively large transit probability compared with the orbital period .",
    "the transit probability is a function of the stellar and planetary radii and the star ",
    "planet separation along the line of sight @xcite . for hd  20782",
    ", we use the stellar radius shown in table  [ stellar ] and adopt a planetary radius of @xmath81  @xmath82 given the minimum mass of 1.41  @xmath53 ( see table  [ planet ] ) and using the mass - radius relationship described by @xcite .",
    "if the planet were in a circular orbit with the same semi - major axis , the transit probability would be 0.4% .",
    "the extreme eccentricity of the orbit results in star ",
    "planet separation of 0.061  au at periastron and 0.076  au at inferior conjunction where a transit is possible .",
    "such a separation is similar to that of a hot jupiter in a circular orbit .",
    "inferior conjunction occurs when @xmath83 ; in this case , the true anomaly is @xmath84 at the time of mid - transit .",
    "this orbital orientation results in an enhanced transit probability of 7.1%",
    ".    a further influence of the high eccentricity on the transit parameters is the expected transit duration .",
    "since the separation at inferior conjunction is comparable to a hot jupiter , the duration is likewise reduced and has an amplitude of 0.13  days ( 3.1  hours ) for a central transit .",
    "the epoch of mid - transit shown in table  [ planet ] was calculated using the same monte - carlo bootstrap method used to calculate the orbital parameter uncertainties .",
    "the time of mid - transit corresponds to a calendar date of 15 january 2015 and a ut of 7:02 .",
    "the uncertainty on this time is 0.1  days which results in a total 1@xmath32 transit window of 0.33  days ( 7.6  hours ) .",
    "the estimated depth of the transit is 0.96% and so should be readily observable in typical millimag photometry .",
    "however , the infrequent occurrence of such events ( see section  [ science ] ) motivated observations from both ground and space .",
    "the derived physical and orbital properties of hd  20782b described in previous sections motivated photometric monitoring of the host star for stellar variability and planetary transit / phase signatures . here",
    "we describe our photometric observations and results in detail .",
    "we collected a total of 191 nightly photometric observations of hd  20782 during its 201314 , 201415 , and 201516 observing seasons to search for stellar variability .",
    "the observations were acquired with the t8 0.80  m automatic photoelectric telescope ( apt ) , one of several automated telescopes operated by tennessee state university ( tsu ) located at fairborn observatory in southern arizona .",
    "the t8 apt is equipped with a two - channel precision photometer that uses a dichroic filter and two emi 9124qb bi - alkali photomultiplier tubes to measure the strmgren @xmath85 and @xmath86 pass bands simultaneously .",
    "we computed the differential magnitudes of hd  20782 with respect to the mean brightness of its three constant comparison stars . to improve the precision further , we combined the differential @xmath85 and @xmath86 observations into a single @xmath87 `` passband . ''",
    "the tsu apts , their precision photometers , observing strategy , and data reduction techniques are described in detail by @xcite .",

    "the observing seasons are quite short from fairborn observatory , only three months in length , because of the star s southerly declination of @xmath88 .",
    "the observations scatter about their grand mean ( indicated by the horizontal dotted line ) with a standard deviation of 0.00205 mag , as given in the upper right corner of the top panel .",
    "this is essentially the limit of precision for the hd  20782 observations because the star s southerly declination results in all measurements being made at air mass values between 2.0 and 2.4 ( see @xcite , figure  8) .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure  [ aptphot ] show the frequency spectrum of the data set and the phase curve computed with the best frequency , respectively .",
    "our frequency analysis is based on least - squares sine fits with trial frequencies between 0.01 and 0.95 c / d , corresponding to periods between one and 100 days .",
    "the goodness of fit at each frequency is measured as the reduction factor in the variance of the original data , whose value lies between the extremes of 0.0 and 1.0 .",
    "a reduction factor of 0.0 corresponds to the case where the variance in the residuals from a least - squares sine fit to the observational data at some trial frequency have the same value as the variance in the original data , i.e. , no reduction in the variance takes place at that particular frequency .",
    "a reduction factor of 1.0 corresponds to the extreme case where the variance in the residuals of the sine fit is 0.0 , i.e. , the sine curve fits the data perfectly with no residuals .",
    "the frequency spectrum in the middle panel shows several peaks with reduction factors near 0.1 , but no peak stands out above the others to suggest a stellar rotation period .",
    "we ran simulations adding computed sine curves to our data sets and found that coherent variations with peak - to - peak amplitudes of @xmath89 mag or larger would be detectable in our light curves .",
    "this places an upper limit to any periodic modulation for hd  20782 , such as rotational modulation caused by starspots .",
    "this is consistent with the low level of magnetic activity ( logr@xmath90 = -4.91 ) given in the discovery paper of @xcite and demonstrates that our best - fit period of 1.2619 days in the bottom panel is spurious .",
    "in addition to the absense of rotational modulation , we find no evidence for longer - term variability ; the three seasonal means in table  [ aptsum ] scatter about their grand mean with a standard deviation of only 0.00058 mag .",
    "given the size of the transit windows and the relatively infrequent opportunities to observe them ( see sections [ science ] and [ transit ] ) , we elected to make use of the microvariability and oscillations of stars ( most ) satellite to observe hd  20782 during the next scheduled transit window .",
    "most has an aperture of 15  cm and a filter passband covering the range 375675  nm , making it well suited to obtain precision optical photometry of very bright stars @xcite .",
    "observations of hd  20782 commenced at hjd 2457035.3 ( 2015 january 12 19:11 ut ) and concluded 7 days later at hjd 2457042.3 ( 2015 january 19 19:11 ut ) .",
    "the predicted time of mid - transit ( see table  [ planet ] ) was bjd 2457037.794 ( 2015 january 15 07:02 ut ) .",
    "the star is outside of most s continuous viewing zone and so required observations outside of normal operational parameters .",
    "for each 101  min orbit , most was able to acquire the target field for 20  mins .",
    "exposure times were 0.6  secs to allow for both the brightness of the target and scattered light due to the roll angle of the spacecraft with respect to the sun .",
    "this resulted in photometry with a 1@xmath32 rms precision of 0.07% .    during the week of most observations ,",
    "a total of 257 measurements of hd  20782 were acquired .",
    "the resulting relative photometry of the data are shown in figure  [ transitfig ] , along with a solid line that indicates the predicted location and depth of a possible transit .",
    "the 1@xmath32 transit window ( 0.33  days ) was described in section  [ transit ] .",
    "we use the 3@xmath32 transit window ( 0.43  days ) to draw vertical dashed lines in figure  [ transitfig ] . a central transit of the planet ( impact parameter of @xmath91 )",
    "is ruled out for most locations within the transit window .",
    "the cadence of the observations is such that a transit duration half that of a central transit could have been missed within the 1@xmath32 transit window .",
    "such a duration corresponds to an impact parameter of @xmath92 , above which transits can not be ruled out by our photometry .",
    "a further consideration is the detection of the rossiter - mclaughlin ( r - m ) effect during a possible transit .",
    "the amplitude of the r - m effect is shown by @xcite to be @xmath93 using our stellar parameters from table  [ stellar ] and the transit parameters described in section  [ transit ] , the amplitude of the r - m effect for a transit of hd  20782b is predicted to be @xmath215.5  ms@xmath15 .",
    "two of our rv measurements ( one each from aat and paras ) are within the transit window , shown close to 0.5 phase in the bottom panel of figure  [ rv ] .",
    "neither of these measurements show evidence of any significant deviation from our keplerian model .",
    "thus the rv data are consistent with the most photometry leading to the conclusion that the planet does not transit the host star .",
    "the phase variations of a planet as it orbits the host star has become a detectable signature in the era of high - precision photometry .",
    "numerous examples of phase signatures have been detected from the planets detected with the _ kepler _ mission @xcite .",
    "exoplanets that are close to their host stars have generally been found to have low geometric albedos , such as the low geometric albedo of hat - p-7b @xcite and the null detection of phase variations from hd  209458b @xcite .",
    "there are exceptions to the rule , however , such as the case of kepler-7b @xcite , and it is likely that a greater understanding of atmospheric processes is needed to explain this diversity @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed a geometric albedo model that scales the geometric albedo with star ",
    "planet separation .",
    "the implication of the model for planets in eccentric orbits is that the geometric albedo is time dependent , with an assumption that reflective / scattering condensates in the upper atmosphere are removed during periastron passage by the increase in radiative flux from the host star .",
    "the generalized expression for the planet to host flux ratio is given by @xmath94 where @xmath26 is the phase angle , @xmath95 is the geometric albedo , @xmath96 is the phase function , @xmath97 is the planetary radius , and @xmath98 is the star  planet separation .",
    "this separation is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the true anomaly .",
    "the phase angle , @xmath26 , is defined to be zero at superior conjunction .",
    "a model of geometric albedo time - dependence assumes that the planetary atmosphere responds to the change in incident flux on timescales comparable to the duration of the periastron encounter .",
    "this effect has been modeled for the eccentric planet hat - p-2b at infrared wavelengths by @xcite .",
    "thus @xcite predicted that , although the largest phase variations of eccentric planets occur during a relatively short fraction of their orbital phase , the amplitude of the signature would be lowered by the subsequent darkening of their atmospheres during periastron .",
    "+   +   +    for hd  20782b , we calculated the predicted phase variations of the planet with respect to the inferior conjunction ( transit ) and periastron times , shown as a dashed line in the top panel of figure  [ phasefig ] .",
    "these orbital locations are very close to each other ( see figure  [ orbitfig ] ) , separated by only 0.66  days . the location of superior conjunction where @xmath101 occurs 5.63 days after the periastron passage .",
    "all three of these orbital locations are covered by the most observations described in section  [ most ] .",
    "we include the additional effects of ellipsoidal variations @xcite and doppler boosting @xcite in the top panel of figure  [ phasefig ] , shown as dotted and dot - dashed lines respectively .",
    "the combined effect of all three ( phase variations , ellipsoidal variations , and doppler boosting ) is shown as a solid line .",
    "for the ellipsoidal component , we have assumed a gravity darkening exponent of @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "for the doppler boosting coefficient , we calculate a value of @xmath103 using the stellar temperature from table  [ stellar ] and the methodology of @xcite . using the model of a distance - dependent geometric albedo and hilton phase function @xcite",
    ", we determined that the amplitude of the phase variations is comparable to the doppler boosting , whereas the ellipsoidal component is a minor contribution to the total flux variations .",
    "another point worth noting is that this model assumes an orbit that is close to edge - on .",
    "the effect of orbital inclination on the relative amplitudes of the three contributing components is minor except for orbits close to face - on @xcite .",
    "as described in section  [ most ] , the original intent of acquiring the most data was for the purpose of observing a potential transit event .",
    "evidence of phase variations was unexpected due to the low predicted amplitude shown in the top panel of figure  [ phasefig ] . to determine the overall trend in the most data",
    ", we calculated a running mean of the data using 20 data points either side of each measurement to calculate the running mean at that location .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown as a solid line along with the individual measurements ( including error bars ) in the middle panel of figure  [ phasefig ] , where we have adjusted the vertical scale of the plot to the range of the running mean values , using the average of the running mean values as the zero - point .",
    "the apparent brightening of the host star between the truncated dates of 38 and 39 on the plot is where the peak of the phase variations are predicted to occur .",
    "this was diagnosed from an instrumentation point of view , and it was determined that the change in the brightness was not caused by any aspect of the most instrumentation or data reduction issues .",
    "we tested the likelihood whether this could be caused by an alignment between intrinsic stellar variability and the expected periastron passage , by conducting a monte - carlo simulation in which we treat the observed data as representative of possible stellar variability and randomly rearrange the data to see how often a similar chance alignment can occur .",
    "each random permutation of the observed flux values to the times of observation resulted in a new dataset for which the running mean was calculated and then analyzed for significant peaks in the flux .",
    "the percentage of simulations for which a specific criteria was met was taken as the probability that the criteria would have been satisfied by chance . based on 10,000 realizations of this simulation , the probability of a peak occurring in the 3839 date range is @xmath217% , and the probability of that peak being of equal or greater amplitude than the observed peak is @xmath24% .",
    "if indeed the observed peak is related to the close passage of the planet to the star , the flux variations may indicate that the assumption by @xcite that the presence of reflective condensates in a planetary atmosphere changes on timescales comparable with the periastron passage is likely incorrect for highly eccentric orbits .",
    "in fact , the larger the eccentricity , the more inconsistent the assumption becomes with the radiative and advective timescales of the atmosphere .",
    "furthermore , the possible presence of phase variations indicates the companion is not self - luminous , further supporting the claim that the companion is planetary rather than stellar in nature @xcite .    to investigate this further , we binned the most photometry into 15 evenly spaced time intervals . the best - fit model to the binned data",
    "is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ phasefig ] where the model includes ellipsoidal variations and doppler boosting as well as phase variations .",
    "the best - fit inclination of the planetary orbit is @xmath104 .",
    "a fit of the data to both the described model and a constant model resulted in @xmath105 which shows that the phase model is quantitatively favored .",
    "however , the model uses a companion radius of @xmath25 jupiter radii and a geometric albedo of unity , which is a physically unlikely scenario . thus there is",
    "either an additional component missing in our model of the data , or the data may be insufficient to fully characterize the flux variations , or some combination of the two .",
    "as noted above , the most compelling aspects of the variations described here are the timing of the variations with those predicted by the phase model , combined with the extreme eccentricity of the planet .",
    "this system is clearly highly unusual amongst the known exoplanets , and we can not exclude the possibility of unaccounted for physics occuring during the extreme conditions of periastron .    1400  k. the passband boundaries of most are indicated by the vertical dashed lines .",
    "the blackbody calculation assumes zero bond albedo and zero heat redistribution ( hot dayside model ) and thus represents a maximum flux scenario .",
    "of the integrated flux , 0.02% falls within the most passband.,width=309 ]    a possible missing factor is that of thermal emission .",
    "this has been shown to be a significant component at the _ kepler _ passband @xcite .",
    "the _ kepler _ passband however is significantly broader than that used by most ( see section  [ most ] ) .",
    "we calculated this component for our observations by estimating the equilibrium temperature of the planet .",
    "to do so , we assumed the most extreme case of zero heat redistribution ( hot dayside ) and zero bond albedo @xcite .",
    "this produces a peak equilibrium temperature at periastron of @xmath21400  k. the resulting blackbody spectrum is shown in figure  [ blackbody ] along with the passband of most , depicted as vertical dashed lines . of the integrated flux from the thermal emission ,",
    "only 0.02% of the total flux falls within the passband of our observations .",
    "this corresponds to a flux ratio of planet to star thermal emission in the most passband of @xmath106 .",
    "we conclude that any phase variations due to the planet are dominated by the optical component .",
    "further data with higher precision are needed to confirm the presence of the variations and constrain the reflective properties of this fascinating planet as it passes through periastron .",
    "exoplanets in eccentric orbits remain some of the most intriguing discoveries of recent decades .",
    "although the semi - amplitude of their rv variations is systematically higher , the orbits of highly eccentric planets are difficult to characterize due the rapid variation at periastron passage .",
    "we have refit the orbit of hd  20782b , consistent with it being the most extreme of these eccentricity cases and have provided new stellar and planetary parameters .",
    "our rv measurements acquired during the brief duration of periastron passage allow a detailed orbital ephemeris to be constructed , despite the relatively long period of @xmath218 months .",
    "our analysis of the _ hipparcos _ astrometry for hd  20782 constrains the inclination sufficiently such that the companion is likely to be planetary rather than stellar .",
    "the uncertainties associated with our astrometric analysis leave open the possibility that the companion lies within the brown dwarf mass regime .",
    "it is expected that further astrometric data from the gaia mission will significantly improve these constraints @xcite .",
    "even with a relatively high transit probability of @xmath27% , we have shown that the planet does not transit the host star .",
    "the possible phase variations soon after periastron might be induced in part by stellar light reflected off the planet s atmosphere .",
    "although our modeling is incomplete , if this hypothesis is true then it raises interesting questions regarding the conditions to which such an extreme orbit exposes the planet .",
    "in particular , the effects of rotation rate and radiative / advective timescales on atmospheric dynamics may be overwhelmed by the short yet intense conditions that occur at the closest approach of the planet to the star .",
    "it has been further noted by several studies that the brightest region of the planet is shifted westward of the substellar point , caused by a relatively cloudy western hemisphere @xcite .",
    "additionally , it seems likely that , although planets in short - period orbits tend to have relatively low geometric albedos , long - period planets in eccentric orbits retain a high geometric albedo during the periastron passage since the atmosphere does not have time to respond to the change in incident flux .",
    "the result of this is a higher than expected flux ratio of the planet to the star at optical wavelengths .",
    "thus , eccentric planets present a particularly lucrative observing opportunity for the study of planetary atmospheres , provided one is able to accurately predict when the peak flux variations are expected to occur .",
    "further observations of this system at times close to inferior conjunction are highly encouraged .",
    "the next two times of inferior conjunction predicted from our ephemeris are bjd @xmath107 ( 2016 september 3 8:36 ut ) and bjd @xmath108 ( 2018 april 23 10:10 ut ) . in each case , the subsequent superior conjunction occurs @xmath26.29 days after the inferior conjunction .",
    "matching these times to those when the target is most visible is not trivial and the timescale of the periastron passage is best suited to continuous space - based observations .",
    "possibilities for these upcoming windows would be a perfect use for upcoming missions that are optimized for bright star observations , such as the characterizing exoplanet satellite ( cheops ) .",
    "a deeper understanding of the orbits and atmospheres of eccentric planets are key milestones towards unlocking the origin and nature of these mysterious objects .",

    "<S> planets in highly eccentric orbits form a class of objects not seen within our solar system . </S>",
    "<S> the most extreme case known amongst these objects is the planet orbiting hd  20782 , with an orbital period of 597  days and an eccentricity of 0.96 . </S>",
    "<S> here we present new data and analysis for this system as part of the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained chiron spectra to perform an independent estimation of the fundamental stellar parameters . </S>",
    "<S> new radial velocities from aat and paras observations during periastron passage greatly improve our knowledge of the eccentric nature of the orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the combined analysis of our keplerian orbital and hipparcos astrometry show that the inclination of the planetary orbit is @xmath0 , ruling out stellar masses for the companion . </S>",
    "<S> our long - term robotic photometry show that the star is extremely stable over long timescales . </S>",
    "<S> photometric monitoring of the star during predicted transit and periastron times using most rule out a transit of the planet and reveal evidence of phase variations during periastron . </S>",
    "<S> these possible photometric phase variations may be caused by reflected light from the planet s atmosphere and the dramatic change in star  </S>",
