    "deep photometric studies of globular clusters have traditionally been restricted to the less crowded outer regions of these objects .",
    "while surveys of this nature with electronic detectors have permitted the properties of relatively faint main sequence stars in nearby clusters to be studied in detail , it has been difficult to assemble photometry of statistically significant samples of stars in the more advanced stages of evolution using the same instrumentation .",
    "the extent of this problem can be reduced by observing the central regions of clusters , where the high stellar densities simplify efforts to obtain photometry of stars spanning a range of brightnesses and evolutionary phases , including the brightest portions of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "studies of the central regions of clusters also reduce the effects of foreground star contamination and , especially when conducted at infrared wavelengths , differential reddening , both of which frustrate efforts to probe the nature of low latitude clusters  objects that will provide important clues into the early evolution of the inner galaxy . the cost of observing stars in these high - density environments is increased crowding , and angular resolutions approaching the diffraction limits of moderately large telescopes are required to survey all but the brightest stars .    in the current paper , high angular resolution",
    "near - infrared images obtained with the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) adaptive optics bonnette ( aob ) are used to probe the central stellar contents in two metal - poor cluster pairs : ngc5272 ( m3 ) @xmath3 ngc6205 ( m13 ) and ngc6287 @xmath3 ngc6341 ( m92 ) . the clusters in each pair were selected to have similar metallicities and distances to facilitate differential photometric comparisons .",
    "the basic properties of the target clusters , including [ fe / h ] , @xmath4 , distance from the galactic center , r@xmath5 , the @xmath6 brightness of the horizontal branch ( hb ) corrected for reddening , @xmath7 , the central surface brightness in @xmath6 corrected for reddening , @xmath8 , and the integrated cluster brightness , m@xmath9 , are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the data in this table were taken from the may 15 , 1997 version of the harris ( 1996 ) database ; the reddening corrections assume that a@xmath10 .    the clusters ngc5272 and ngc6205 , which are a classic second - parameter pair , have been the subject of numerous photometric and spectroscopic investigations at visible wavelengths .",
    "however , only a modest body of infrared photometric data has previously been obtained for these clusters .",
    "cohen , frogel , & persson ( 1978 ) recorded @xmath0 aperture measurements of selected bright giants in the outer regions of both clusters , while davidge & harris ( 1995 ) used moderately deep @xmath11 and @xmath12 images to investigate the stellar content of giants and main sequence stars in ngc6205 .",
    "ngc6287 and ngc6341 are among the most metal - poor clusters in the galaxy .",
    "ngc6341 has been well - studied at visible wavelengths and is a standard benchmark for constraining the age of the universe ( e.g. salaris , deglinnocenti , & weiss 1997 , bolte & hogan 1995 ) .",
    "et al . _ ( 1978 ) also obtained near - infrared aperture measurements of bright stars in the outer regions of this cluster .",
    "ngc6287 is located in the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "the close proximity to the galactic center , size , and metallicity of ngc6287 lead van den bergh ( 1993 ) to suggest that this cluster may be one of the oldest objects in the galaxy .",
    "efforts to interpret the visible ( stetson & west 1994 ) and near - infrared ( davidge 1998 ) cmds of the outer regions of ngc6287 are complicated by differential reddening and field star contamination . davidge ( 1998 )",
    "derived an age of 12 gyr for ngc6287 based on the @xmath12 lf of sub - giant branch ( sgb ) stars and comparisons with the bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) models .",
    "the data presented in this paper will be used to investigate the photometric characteristics of the cluster stars and assess relative ages within each cluster pair .",
    "the data were recorded with the same instrumental configuration over a period of only two nights and include the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) ; hence , these data are well suited to the task of relative age determination . the observations and reductions are described in  2 , while the photometric measurements , lfs and cmds are discussed in  3 .",
    "this information is used to investigate the relative ages of each pair of clusters in  4 .",
    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  5 .",
    "the data were recorded on the nights of ut march 8/9 ( ngc5272 , ngc6205 , and ngc6287 ) and march 9/10 ( ngc6341 ) 1998 with the cfht aob ( rigaut _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and kir camera .",
    "the latter contains a @xmath13 hg : cd : te array with an angular scale of 0.034 arcsec per pixel , so that the total imaged field is @xmath14 arcsec .",
    "the cfht aob uses natural guide stars as reference beacons for atmospheric compensation .",
    "these were selected at the telescope , and centered on the detector to reduce anisoplanaticism .",
    "data were recorded through @xmath15 , and @xmath12 filters , with a complete observing sequence consisting of 4 exposures per filter .",
    "the exception was ngc5272 , for which 8 exposures per filter were recorded .",
    "the telescope pointing was offset following each exposure to define a @xmath16 arcsec square dither pattern .",
    "additional details of the observations , including right ascension ( @xmath17 ) and declination ( @xmath18 ) , total exposure times , and the fwhm of the central peak in the point spread function ( psf ) , averaged over the entire field , are summarized in table 2 .    with the exception of ngc6205 , which was observed during a brief episode of bad seeing , the fwhm entries for @xmath19 and @xmath12 are close to the telescope diffraction limit .",
    "however , at moderate strehl ratios the fwhm provides an incomplete picture of image quality , as much of the energy in the psf is contained outside of the central peak ( e.g. davidge _ et al . _",
    "1997ab ) ; indeed , the ao - compensated psf was traced out to a radius of at least 1.5 arcsec in observations of moderately bright stars recorded on the same nights as the cluster data .",
    "the diameter of an aperture containing 50% of the psf energy provides a means of quantifying the light distribution , and the 50% encircled energy diameters for the ngc6287 data , which should also be representative of the ngc5272 and ngc6341 observations , are 0.42 ( @xmath11 ) , 0.25 ( @xmath19 ) , and 0.25 arcsec ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the raw images contain signatures introduced by the telescope , instrumentation , and sky that must be removed before making photometric measurements .",
    "some of these signatures are multiplicative in nature ( throughput variations introduced by the optics and pixel - to - pixel differences in detector sensitivity ) , while others are additive ( detector bias and dark current , thermal emission from objects along the optical path , and sky emission ) .",
    "calibration frames monitoring these signatures were either recorded ( darks , flats ) or derived ( thermal emission ) from the observations .",
    "dark frames for each integration time were recorded mid - way through the run , while dome flats were constructed by subtracting exposures of the dome white spot taken with the flat - field lamps ` off ' from those recorded with the lamps ` on ' .",
    "this differencing procedure removes the additive contributions from detector dark current and thermal emission , while preserving the multiplicative flat - field and detector sensitivity variations .",
    "images showing the thermal emission pattern for each filter were constructed by median - combining flat - fielded images of blank sky regions , which were recorded at various times throughout the run .",
    "the data were reduced using the following sequence : ( 1 ) dark subtraction , ( 2 ) division by dome flats , ( 3 ) subtraction of the dc sky level , which was estimated by taking the mode of the pixel intensity distribution in each flat - fielded frame , and ( 4 ) subtraction of the thermal signature .",
    "the results for each field were registered to correct for the offsets introduced while dithering , and then median - combined .",
    "the final @xmath12 images are shown in figures 1  4 .",
    "the photometric measurements were made using the psf - fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) , which is part of the daophot ( stetson 1987 ) photometry package .",
    "anisoplanaticism causes the psf to vary with distance from the ao reference star , and the extent of these variations in the ngc6287 field is illustrated in figure 5 , where the @xmath11 and @xmath12 psfs in two different annuli centered on the reference star are compared .",
    "the effects of anisoplanaticism are greatest in @xmath11 , where the fwhm changes from 0.18 arcsec to 0.28 arcsec between the inner and outer annuli . for comparison , the fwhm changes from 0.12 and 0.14 arcsec in @xmath12 .",
    "psf variations complicate efforts to measure accurate stellar brightnesses . to quantify the affects of psf variations in the current data ,",
    "stellar brightnesses were measured from the ngc6287 @xmath11 and @xmath12 images using psfs constructed from stars ( 1 ) distributed over the entire field , ( 2 ) when r@xmath20 , the distance between a star and the reference source , is @xmath21 arcsec , and ( 3 ) when r@xmath22 arcsec .",
    "the brightnesses of stars with r@xmath22 arcsec measured with the first and third set of psfs are very similar , indicating that the use of a constant psf does not significantly affect photometric measurements at moderately large distances from the reference star .",
    "the mean brightness differences among moderately bright stars when using these psfs are @xmath23 mag ( j ) , and @xmath24 mag ( k ) , where the quoted errors are dominated by uncertainties in the aperture corrections .",
    "the standard deviations about the @xmath25 values provide additional insight into the affects of psf variations , and these are @xmath26 mag ( j ) and 0.001 mag ( k ) .",
    "this comparison indicates that the use of a psf constructed from stars over the entire field affects brightness measurements by @xmath27 mag when @xmath28 arcsec .",
    "roughly 80% of the stars in our sample are located in this region .",
    "psf variations are of greater concern close to the reference source . indeed , the mean brightness differences between measurements made with the first and second set of psfs for stars with @xmath29 arcsec are @xmath30 ( j ) and @xmath31 ( k ) .",
    "the errors reflect the large uncertainties in the aperture corrections for the measurements made using the second set of psfs , as the number of psf stars is small when @xmath29 arcsec , and there is significant crowding , as the reference source is located close to the cluster center .",
    "the standard deviation about the @xmath32 values are @xmath33 mag ( j ) and 0.01 mag ( k ) .",
    "hence , psf variations affect brightness measurements near the reference source by a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "we emphasize that only 20% of the stellar sample is located within 8.5 arcsec of the reference source .",
    "the psf variations introduced by anisoplanaticism depend on a number of environmental ( e.g. wind speed and direction , altitude distribution of turbulence layers , location and brightness of the reference source etc ) and instrumental ( e.g. the alignment of optical components and the detector , order of compensation provided by the ao system etc ) factors and , with the limited environmental information currently available at most telescopes , can only be modelled empirically .",
    "while daophot has the capability of constructing a variable psf , a large number of bright , preferably isolated , stars are required , and efforts to construct a variable psf that produced better photometric measurements than a single psf , constructed from stars over the entire field for each cluster@xmath3filter combination , were confounded by crowding .",
    "given these difficulties , and also considering that the experiments described above indicate that the majority of stars are not affected by the use of a constant psf , we elected to use a single psf to obtain photometric measurements for subsequent analysis .",
    "the photometric calibration was defined using ukirt faint standard stars ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) , which were observed at various times throughout the two night run . the standard star brightnesses were corrected for atmospheric extinction using the coefficients derived by guarnieri , dixon , & longmore ( 1991 ) , and the results were then used to derive photometric zeropoints and first order color terms .",
    "the uncertainties in the photometric zeropoints infered from the scatter in the seven standard star measurements are : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 mag @xmath37 .",
    "the brightnesses at which sample incompleteness becomes significant can be estimated from the turn - over points at the faint end of the lfs .",
    "the @xmath12 lfs of these clusters are plotted in figure 6 , where n@xmath38 is the number of stars per 0.5 mag interval per square arcsec .",
    "it is evident that the data are complete to @xmath39 mag , which is comparable to , or slightly fainter than , the msto in each cluster .",
    "the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 cmds are plotted in figures 7 , 8 , and 9 .",
    "the rgb , sgb , msto , and hb sequences are clearly evident in the @xmath40 and @xmath42 cmds of all four clusters ; an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) component is also apparent in the ngc5272 , ngc6205 , and ngc6287 cmds .",
    "the ngc5272 cmds involving the @xmath11 filter show the largest photometric scatter , as these data have unusually large psf variations . however , the scatter in the other cmds is modest , and this is demonstrated in figure 10 , where the @xmath43 color distributions of stars with @xmath12 between 12 and 14.5 , an interval over which the @xmath41 cmd is practically vertical and contamination from the hb is small , are shown .",
    "the standard deviations of these distributions range from a low of @xmath44 mag for ngc6205 to a high of @xmath45 mag for ngc5272 .",
    "if the random uncertainties in the @xmath19 and @xmath12 measurements are assumed to be equal , then these comparisons suggest that the internal photometric errors in the @xmath19 and @xmath12 measurements of moderately bright stars are @xmath46 mag for ngc6205 and @xmath47 mag for ngc5272 .",
    "two caveats that should be considered when assessing these results are that ( 1 ) the presence of agb stars will broaden the distributions slightly , and ( 2 ) the psf - variation experiments described earlier indicate that the widths of the color distributions are lower limits that apply mainly to stars with @xmath28 arcsec .",
    "comparisons with published infrared photometric measurements verify the color calibration of the aob data .",
    "the open squares in figures 7 , 8 , and 9 are the single element detector measurements published by cohen _",
    "et al . _ ( 1978 ) for bright giants in ngc5272 , ngc6205 , and ngc6341 and the array detector measurements published by davidge ( 1998 ) of bright stars near the center of ngc6287 . crowding and , to a lesser extent , differential reddening cause the scatter in the davidge ( 1998 ) measurements to be larger than in the cohen _",
    "_ measurements , which are restricted to stars in the outer regions of the clusters .",
    "it is evident that the published data are in reasonable agreement with the aob observations .",
    "the brightnesses and colors of key features on the cmds that provide age and distance information at infrared wavelengths have been measured , and the results are listed in table 3 .",
    "the brightness of the hb is the standard means of judging cluster distances at visible wavelengths .",
    "however , the hb is not considered here since ( 1 ) it forms an almost vertical sequence on infrared cmds , and ( 2 ) while relations between rr lyrae infrared brightness and period have been defined ( e.g. carney , storm , & jones 1992 ; longmore _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) , ngc6287 has not yet been extensively surveyed for variable stars .",
    "therefore , the brightness of the rgb - tip is adopted to gauge relative distances .",
    "stochastic effects may compromise rgb - tip brightness measurements since evolution on the upper giant branch proceeds at a rapid pace .",
    "however , numerical simulations indicate that only a modest survey of bright stellar content is required to determine the rgb - tip brightness to an accuracy of @xmath48 mag in a typical globular cluster ( crocker & rood 1984 ) .",
    "stars near the rgb - tip are saturated in the aob data .",
    "therefore , the @xmath11 , @xmath19 and @xmath12 brightnesses of the rgb - tip for ngc5272 , ngc6205 , and ngc6341 were estimated from the brightest stars in the cohen _",
    "et al . _ ( 1978 ) sample .",
    "these same cohen _",
    "et al . _ ( 1978 ) measurements were considered by frogel _",
    "et al . _ ( 1983 ) in their study of the bolometric brightness of the rgb - tip in a much larger sample of globular clusters , and the rgb - tip brightnesses derived for ngc5272 , ngc6205 , and ngc6341 fell within the @xmath48 mag scatter envelop defined by the larger cluster sample , lending confidence to the rgb - tip brightness estimates for these three clusters .",
    "davidge ( 1998 ) measured the @xmath12 brightness of the rgb - tip for ngc6287 , and rgb - tip brightnesses in @xmath11 and @xmath19 were obtained from the data listed in table 3 of that paper .",
    "the rgb - tip brightnesses listed in table 3 of the current paper have an estimated uncertainty of @xmath48 mag .",
    "rgb - tip brightnesses can be used to estimate absolute distances , although the calibration is very uncertain .",
    "the bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) isochrones , when transformed onto the near - infrared observational plane using the color relations given by davidge & harris ( 1995a ) , predict that m@xmath49 for metal - poor clusters , so that the predicted distance moduli for the clusters are 15.1 ( ngc5272 ) , 14.3 ( ngc6205 ) , 14.6 ( ngc6287 ) , and 14.8 ( ngc6341 ) . for comparison , the bertelli _",
    "( 1994 ) models predict an rgb - tip brightness that is 0.2 mag fainter in @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting distance moduli are reasonably consistent with those predicted by the carney _",
    "( 1992 ) rr lyrae calibration , which gives distance moduli of 14.9 ( ngc5272 ) , 14.1 ( ngc6205 ) , and 14.4 ( ngc6341 ) with the cluster properties given in table 1 .",
    "while the brightness of the msto is a prime age indicator , it can not be measured accurately from these data as the cmds are almost vertical at this point .",
    "however , the brightness of the sgb provides age information that is comparable to that of the msto brightness ( chaboyer _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . for this study",
    "the sgb brightness 0.1 mag redward of the msto was measured from the ridgeline of each cmd , and the estimated uncertainty in these measurements is @xmath48 mag .",
    "the @xmath50 and @xmath51 colors of the msto are very well - defined , and the estimated uncertainties in the observed msto colors are @xmath52 mag ,    the de - reddened msto colors for each cluster , derived using the rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) reddening law , are listed in table 4 .",
    "the msto colors for ngc6341 are the smallest of the group , as expected given that this is the most metal - poor cluster . however , the de - reddened msto colors of ngc6287 are abnormally large , especially in @xmath51 .",
    "it is worth noting that the uncertainty in @xmath4 for ngc6287 is relatively large , amounting to @xmath53 mag .",
    "@xmath4 estimates for this cluster derived from data at visible wavelengths favour a value near 0.6 ( zinn 1980 , reed _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 , stetson & west 1994 ) , while far - infrared properties of interstellar dust ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) and the near - infrared colors of giant branch stars ( davidge 1998 ) favour 0.8 . nevertheless , even if @xmath54 ( davidge 1998 ) , then @xmath55 , which is still significantly larger than the other clusters , although @xmath56 in this case .",
    "the msto colors of ngc6287 ostensibly suggest that either ( 1 ) the near - infrared reddening law towards this cluster differs significantly from that given by rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) , or ( 2 ) the spectral - energy distribution ( sed ) of stars in this cluster is somehow peculiar .",
    "the @xmath57 two - color diagram ( tcd ) provides additional insight into these possibilities , and the tcd for each cluster is shown in figure 11 . in an effort to reduce observational scatter , normal points were created by computing the mode of the color distribution in @xmath58 mag ( rgb ) or @xmath48 mag ( sgb , msto ) bins along the @xmath12 axis of the cmds in figures 8 and 9 , and it is the resulting @xmath50 and @xmath43 pairs for each @xmath12 interval which are plotted in figure 11 .",
    "also shown in this figure are the loci of metal - poor giant branch and main sequence stars listed in tables 4 and 5 of davidge & harris ( 1995a ) .",
    "only the aob data were used to compute normal points , so the most evolved giant branch stages are abscent in figure 11 .    the ngc5272 , ngc6205 , and ngc6341 measurements fall close to the fiducial sequences in figure 11 ; however , the ngc6287 points , while having @xmath59 colors similar to those of the other clusters , have relatively red @xmath60 colors .",
    "figure 7 of davidge ( 1998 ) shows a similar tendency for ngc6287 stars , although by an amount that is smaller than what is seen here .",
    "figure 11 suggests either that the @xmath61 m seds of stars in ngc6287 may differ from those in other clusters , or that the reddening law towards ngc6287 is peculiar .",
    "near - infrared spectra would provide a direct means of investigating the seds of stars in ngc6287 and provide further insight into the placement of ngc6287 data points on the tcd .",
    "the hb forms an almost vertical sequence in near - infrared cmds , and so the infrared lf of hb stars provides a means of comparing hb content .",
    "the @xmath12 hb lfs , normalised according to the total number of detected hb stars per cluster , are compared in figure 12 , where @xmath62 refers to the difference in brightness between each point on the hb and the rgb - tip .",
    "it is evident that these clusters define a range of hb contents : the ngc6205 and ngc6341 hbs are dominated by hot stars that are relatively faint in the infrared , while the hb stars in ngc5272 and ngc6287 are distributed over a broader range of near - infrared brightnesses , and hence temperatures .",
    "a kolmogoroff - smirnoff test indicates that the hb lfs of ngc5272 and ngc6205 differ at the 99% confidence level , while the hb lfs of ngc6287 and ngc6341 differ at the 98% confidence level .",
    "it is evident that significant information concerning hb content can be obtained from near - infrared observations , which has important implications for studies of heavily obscured metal - poor clusters .",
    "if age is the dominant parameter defining hb content in these clusters then ngc6205 should be older than ngc5272 , while ngc6341 should be older than ngc6287 .",
    "is there evidence to support this picture ?",
    "vandenberg & durrell ( 1990 ) used the brightness difference between the msto and rgb - tip to investigate the relative ages of clusters in a manner that does not require knowledge of cluster distance or reddening .",
    "a similar statistic , which we refer to as @xmath63 , that relies on the brightness of the sgb rather than the msto , can be constructed from the measurements in table 3 , and the results are listed in table 4 .",
    "the estimated uncertainties in @xmath63 are @xmath64 mag , and the entries for ngc5272 , ngc6287 and ngc6341 agree within these limits . while the @xmath63 values for ngc6205 are systematically larger than those of the other clusters , the significance of this result is not high ; indeed , the @xmath63 values for ngc5272 and ngc6205 in @xmath11 and @xmath19 differ at only slightly more than the @xmath65 level .",
    "the @xmath64 mag uncertainties in @xmath63 correspond to a @xmath66 gyr age sensitivity .",
    "hence , we will not consider these results further when assessing the relative ages of the clusters , and note that extremely high - quality data will be required to obtain interesting age constraints from @xmath63 measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the general agreement between the @xmath63 measurements for the various clusters lends confidence to the rgb - tip and sgb brightnesses .",
    "another way to estimate relative cluster ages independent of reddening and distance is to register the cmds using reference markers near the main sequence and then compare giant branch locations ( e.g. vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1990 , sarajedini & demarque 1990 ) . for the current study the @xmath40 and @xmath42 cmds for each cluster pair , defined using normal points computed by taking the mode of the color distribution within @xmath58 mag ( rgb ) and @xmath48 mag ( sgb , msto ) intervals along the brightness axes of figures 7 and 9 ,",
    "were aligned along the horizontal and vertical axes using the msto colors and sgb brightnesses listed in table 3 , and the results are shown in figures 13 and 14 .",
    "the lower giant branches of ngc5272 and ngc6205 overlap when the @xmath67 and @xmath42 cmds are registered at the msto and sgb .",
    "while there are differences below the msto , these are likely not significant as they occur near the faint limit of the data .",
    "the upper giant branches of ngc5272 and ngc6205 , defined using the cohen",
    "_ et al . _ ( 1978 ) data , are of greater interest , as they diverge on both cmds .",
    "there is no hint of this behaviour when only the aob data are compared , and we suspect that the disagreement is spurious , arising from minor differences in the photometric calibration of the two ngc5272 datasets . indeed ,",
    "if the cohen _ et al .",
    "_ ( 1978 ) ngc5272 measurements in figure 14 are shifted by @xmath68 mag towards smaller @xmath69 values then they give a better match to the aob data for this cluster as well as to the ngc6205 upper giant branch .",
    "the lower giant branches of ngc6287 and ngc6341 also overlap when the @xmath40 cmds of these clusters are registered at the msto and sgb .",
    "however , the cluster sequences show significant differences at the bright end , in that ngc6287 has a steeper upper giant branch than ngc6341 ; davidge ( 1998 ) found that the upper giant branch of ngc6287 is steeper than expected from theoretical models . further differences between the cmds of ngc6287 and ngc6341 are apparent in the right hand panel of figure 14 , where the giant branch of ngc6287 falls consistently to the left of the ngc6341 sequence .",
    "ngc6287 is not the only inner spheroid cluster to show peculiar giant branch properties .",
    "figure 4 of minniti , olszewski , & rieke ( 1995 ) compares the @xmath42 giant branch loci of a number of inner spheroid clusters , and there is little or no evidence for correlations between mean metallicity , giant branch color , and/or slope . moreover , the @xmath42 cmds of the inner spheroid clusters m22 ( davidge & harris 1995b ) and m28 ( davidge _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) show peculiar giant branch morphologies when compared with outer halo clusters .",
    "the error bars in the lower right hand corner of each panel in figures 13 and 14 show the range in relative rgb positions expected for @xmath2 gyr age differences , as predicted from the [ fe / h ] = 2 bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) isochrones , which we transformed onto the near - infrared observational plane using the procedure described by davidge & harris ( 1995a ) .",
    "the lower giant branches of ngc5272 and ngc6205 in figures 13 suggest that the ages of these clusters differ by no more than @xmath1 gyr . however , while the lower giant branches of ngc6287 and ngc6341 in figure 13 are suggestive of a difference in age not exceeding @xmath2 gyr , the comparison in the right hand panel of figure 14 is suggestive of an age difference approaching 4 gyr , in the sense that ngc6287 is older .",
    "the lfs of globular clusters are sensitive to age variations at the brightness of the sgb ( e.g. bergbusch & vandenberg 1992 ; jimenez & padoan 1996 ) , and hence provide an independent means of checking relative ages deduced from cmds . while dynamical effects will alter the mass function , and thereby complicate cluster - to - cluster comparisons , the lf only becomes sensitive to these effects below the main sequence .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath19 , and @xmath12 lfs of each cluster pair , computed with 0.2 mag bins and excluding hb and agb stars identified from the cmds , are compared in figures 15 , 16 , and 17 .",
    "the lfs have been normalized along the vertical axis over a 3 mag interval on the upper giant branch , while the horizontal axis shows brightness measured with respect to the rgb - tip .",
    "the @xmath11 lfs are not suitable for age comparisons , as incompleteness becomes signicant on the sgb .",
    "however , the @xmath19 and @xmath12 lfs extend 0.5  1.0 mag fainter than the msto , and it is evident that the lfs of each cluster pair are not significantly different on the sgb . the effect of a @xmath2 gyr age variation near the faint end of the sgb , derived from the bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) models , is shown in each figure , and the expected deviation is comparable to the uncertainties in each bin .",
    "hence , the @xmath19 and @xmath12 lfs indicate that ngc5272 and ngc6205 are coeval , as are ngc6287 and ngc6341 , to within @xmath2 gyr .",
    "@xmath0 images with angular resolutions approaching the diffraction limit of the 3.6 metre cfht have been obtained of the central regions of four metal - poor globular clusters : ngc5272 , ngc6205 , ngc6287 , and ngc6341 .",
    "the clusters were paired according to metallicity and distance to facilitate differential comparisons of cluster properties , and photometric measurements were made using the psf - fitting routine in allstar .",
    "the crowded nature of the cluster fields necessitated the use of a single psf for each cluster@xmath3filter combination , and it is expected that psf variations will introduce systematic errors of roughly 0.01 mag in the brightnesses of stars more than 8.5 arcsec from the reference star , which account for roughly 80% of stars in the images .",
    "these errors may climb to a few hundredths of a mag for stars within 8.5 arcsec of the reference star .",
    "comparisons with published observations indicate that the photometric calibration is valid to within a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "the hb contents of each cluster pair were investigated using the @xmath12 lf of hb stars .",
    "the ` classical ' second - parameter pair ngc5272 and ngc6205 provides an important test case to determine if differences between hb contents can be detected in the infrared , and the @xmath12 hb lfs of these clusters differ in a way that is consistent with what is seen at optical wavelengths .",
    "the temperature distribution of hb stars in ngc6287 and ngc6341 are also found to be significantly different .",
    "relative cluster ages have been determined using two independent methods : ( 1 ) the color difference between the msto and the giant branch , measured from near - infrared cmds , and ( 2 ) the near - infrared lfs of sgb stars .",
    "a third possible age indicator , the brightness difference between the rgb - tip and a point on the sgb , was too insensitive to age to be of interest with the current data .",
    "the near - infrared cmds of ngc5272 and ngc6205 , when registered near the msto and sgb , indicate that the ages of these clusters agree to within @xmath1 gyr , while the sgb lfs are suggestive of ages that agree to within @xmath2 gyr .",
    "these data thus do not support the notion that age is the second parameter ( e.g. salaris & weiss 1997 , stetson , vandenberg , & bolte 1996 , but see also chaboyer _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 and lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ) .",
    "grundahl ( 1998 ) has obtained high - precision ground - based observations of ngc5272 and ngc6205 in the stromgren filter system , and his data are also consistent with little or no difference in age .",
    "the problems arising from field star contamination and differential reddening that frustrate efforts to study the outer regions of ngc6287 ( e.g. davidge 1998 , stetson & west 1994 ) are largely avoided when the high - density central area of the cluster is studied , and the current data provide insight into the relative ages of ngc6287 and ngc6341 .",
    "the @xmath40 cmds and near - infrared lfs suggest that the ages of these clusters agree to within @xmath2 gyr , and thus do not support the hypothesis that the inner regions of the galaxy formed significantly before the outer halo , contrary to what might be infered from the properties of rr lyraes in baade s window ( lee 1992a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath42 cmds of ngc6287 and ngc6341 ostensibly suggest that the former is 4 gyr older than the latter .",
    "a similar difference in age was found when the @xmath42 cmd of the [ fe / h ] @xmath70 globular cluster m28 ( r@xmath71 kpc ) was compared with cmds of clusters having r@xmath72 kpc ( davidge , ct , & harris 1996 ; davidge & harris 1997 ) .",
    "ngc6287 is thus the second inner spheroid cluster to have an extremely old age infered from the @xmath42 cmd .",
    "however , the significance of this last result is not clear , as the location of ngc6287 stars on the near - infrared tcd suggest that the @xmath61 m photometric properties of metal - poor stars in this cluster differ from those of outer halo objects .",
    "this brings into question the validity of @xmath42 cmd comparisons between inner and outer halo clusters .",
    "the relative ages of ngc6287 and ngc6341 notwithstanding , ngc6287 appears to be a unique object . with a plunging orbit ( van den bergh 1993 ) , and a broadly populated hb (  4 ) , ngc6287 has the characteristics of van den bergh s ( 1993 ) @xmath17 population of globular clusters , the other members of which have r@xmath73 kpc .",
    "the discovery of hb stars spanning a range of temperatures in ngc6287 also challenges lee s ( 1992b ) finding that the hb content of inner spheroid globular clusters can be characterised by a single parameter ",
    "metallicity ; rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reach a similar conclusion for metal - rich globular clusters .",
    "deep photometric surveys of other metal - poor clusters in the inner galaxy will reveal if the hb properties of ngc6287 are truely unique , or representative of a still largely unstudied population of inner spheroid clusters .",
    "if ngc6287 is a bona fide member of the inner spheroid then it is a remnant of what was once a much more populous cluster system , the members of which , especially those that had low masses , low concentrations , and circular orbits , were disrupted by dynamical interactions ( e.g. murali & weinberg 1997 , vesperini 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "if this is the case then the initial properties of ngc6287 were undoubtedly very different from what are observed now .",
    "for example , selective pruning of low mass stars has likely occured , and the current mass may be more than @xmath74 lower than the initial value ( murali & weinberg 1997 ) . studies of the main sequence mass function , especially near the center of ngc6287 , where the signatures of mass segregation are conspicuous ( e.g. weinberg 1994 , pryor , smith , & mcclure 1986 ) , will provide clues into the dynamical history of this cluster .    the discovery of the sgr dwarf spheroidal ( ibata , gilmore , & irwin 1994 ) , which has an entourage of four globular clusters ( ibata _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; da costa & armandroff 1995 ) , suggests that accretion events may play a significant role in the evolution of galaxies , and that the present - day sample of globular clusters in the inner galaxy may contain interlopers that formed in external systems .",
    "in fact , the radius and metallicity of ngc6287 are not inconsistent with a dwarf spheroidal origin .",
    "indeed , van den bergh ( 1994 ) finds that the globular clusters in the fornax dwarf spheroidal have radii comparable to those of globular clusters in the inner halo , so the compact size of ngc6287 is not an unambiguous indicator of an inner spheroid origin .",
    "moreover , the metallicities of globular clusters in the dwarf satellite companions of the galaxy ( da costa & armandroff 1995 ) and m31 ( da costa & mould 1988 ) are typically ( but , as demonstrated by terzan 7 , not exclusively ) very metal - poor , like ngc6287 .",
    "therefore , while the observational characteristics of ngc6287 are ostensibly consistent with membership in the inner spheroid ( van den bergh 1993 ) , the evidence is not ironclad .",
    "sincere thanks are extended to sidney van den bergh and frank grundahl for providing comments on an earlier draft of this paper .",
    "an anonymous referee also made comments that greatly improved the paper .",
