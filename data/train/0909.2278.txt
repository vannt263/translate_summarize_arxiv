    "<S> wavelength - scale , high @xmath0-factor photonic crystal cavities  @xcite have emerged as a platform of choice for on - chip manipulation of optical signals , with applications ranging from low - power optical signal processing  @xcite and cavity quantum electrodynamics  @xcite to biochemical sensing . </S>",
    "<S> many of these applications , however , are limited by the fabrication tolerances and the inability to precisely control the resonant wavelength of fabricated structures . </S>",
    "<S> various techniques for post - fabrication wavelength trimming @xcite and dynamical wavelength control  using , for example , thermal effects  @xcite , free carrier injection  @xcite , low temperature gas condensation  @xcite , and immersion in fluids  @xcite  have been explored . </S>",
    "<S> however , these methods are often limited by small tuning ranges , high power consumption , or the inability to tune continuously or reversibly . in this letter , by combining nano - electro - mechanical systems ( nems ) and nanophotonics , we demonstrate reconfigurable photonic crystal nanobeam cavities that can be continuously and dynamically tuned using electrostatic forces . </S>",
    "<S> a tuning of @xmath1 nm has been demonstrated with less than @xmath2 v of external bias and negligible steady - state power consumption .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been theoretically predicted  @xcite and experimentally verified  @xcite that photonic crystal nanobeam cavities ( phcnb ) can have ultra - high quality factors , on - par with those demonstrated in conventional photonic crystal cavities based on a two - dimensional lattice of holes . </S>",
    "<S> phcnb cavities can be viewed as a doubly clamped nanobeam , the simplest nems device , perforated with a one - dimensional lattice of holes , a textbook example of an optical grating . by introducing an appropriate chirp in the grating </S>",
    "<S> , ultra - high @xmath0 factors and small mode volume optical resonators can be realized  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when two phcnb cavities are placed in each other s near field , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geometry ] , their resonant modes couple , resulting in two supermodes with resonant frequencies that are highly dependent on the spacing between the nanobeams  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be attributed to two major factors . </S>",
    "<S> first , the coupling between the two resonators increases with the reduction in the lateral separation between the nanobeams , which results in greater splitting between the two supermodes . at the same time , as the nanobeams are drawn closer together , the higher order effect of the coupling induced frequency shift  @xcite becomes significant ( especially for separations @xmath3 nm ) and red shifting of both of the supermodes occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the net effect of these two factors is that the even supermode experiences a considerable red shift as the separation is reduced , while the wavelength of the odd supermode stays relatively constant ( the two effects cancel out )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong dependence of the wavelength of the even supermode on the separation between two nanobeams renders coupled - phcnb cavities highly suited for applications in motion and mass sensing . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the strong optical fields that exist in the air region between the coupled - phcnb cavities makes these devices excellent candidates for biochemical sensing applications . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by simultaneously taking advantage of both the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom of such these cavities , a plethora of exciting optomechanical phenomena can be realized  @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we take advantage of the mechanical flexibility of coupled phcnbs to realize reconfigurable optomechanical devices that can be electrostatically actuated  @xcite . by applying a potential difference directly across the nanobeams </S>",
    "<S> , an attractive electrostatic force can be induced between the two nanobeams , resulting in a decrease of the gap between the nanobeams , as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geometry ] b and c. this , in turn , results in the change of the resonant wavelength of the two supermodes . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent optical and mechanical finite - element simulations were used to model the deflection of the nanobeams due to the electrostatic forces , and its influence on the optical eigenfrequencies ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : geometry]c ) . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geometry]d shows the dependence of the nanobeam separation ( red curve ) on the applied voltage , as well as the differential separation change for different bias voltages , in the case of a device with @xmath4 nm initial separation between nanobeams . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that nanobeam separation , measured at the middle of the nanobeams , can be reduced to 50 nm with @xmath5 v of external bias . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the change in the separation per unit of applied voltage strongly depends on the applied bias , and is on the order of 25 nm / v for @xmath6 v. the influence of the electrostatically - controlled nanobeam separation on the resonances of two supermodes is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tuning]a . </S>",
    "<S> we found that , in our system , the even supermode red shifts while the odd supermode experiences very little dispersion ( remaims effectively stationary ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in good agreement with our previous results  @xcite , where the dependence of the supermode eigenfrequencies on lithographically - defined separations ( static tuning ) was studied .    </S>",
    "<S> [ hbtp ]    encouraged by these results , we fabricated our opto - mechanical devices using similar techniques to those reported in our previous work  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the principal difference here is that the two phcnbs are electrically isolated . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in order to make electrical contact to each nanobeam , au contact pads were lithographically patterned onto the substrate ( see methods section ) . </S>",
    "<S> an electron micrograph of a fabricated structure is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geometry]a . </S>",
    "<S> the optical characterization of the fabricated structures was performed using a resonant scattering setup  @xcite ( see methods section ) . </S>",
    "<S> a normally incident tunable laser - beam was focused down onto the cavities and the resonantly back - scattered signal was analyzed after cross - polarizing it with respect to the incoming wave . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tuning]b shows the experimental results for the nanobeam cavities , illustrating the dependence of the even and odd supermode eigenfrequencies on the applied bias voltage . very good agreement with numerical modeling can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally measured resonant wavelengths were within @xmath7 of the simulated ones , and the tuning trend matched very well with the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the slight discrepancy can be attributed to several effects , including the uncertainty in the refractive index of the doped silicon device layer , variations in the layer thickness , and uncertainty in the amount of tensile stress in the device layer of the soi ( @xmath8 mpa , according to soitec ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical @xmath0 factor of the modes was determined by a fano fit  @xcite ( see methods section ) to the scattered waveform . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 factor of the even mode was around @xmath9 while that of the odd mode was around @xmath10 . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we intentionally designed and fabricated cavities with a lower @xmath0 in order to facilitate experimental characterization via the resonant scattering approach . in our previous work , we demonstrated that coupled phcnb cavities can have @xmath0 factors in the @xmath11 range  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that the @xmath0 factors did not change observably across the whole tuning range . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast to tuning via free - carrier injection , which results in significant reduction in the cavity @xmath0 factor due to free - carrier absorption .    in our best devices </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to shift the resonant wavelength of the even supermode up to @xmath12 nm when less than @xmath2 v of external bias voltage was applied ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : semtuning]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this wide tuning range is nearly @xmath13 times larger than the linewidth of the cavity resonance in the present design , and this ratio can be further improved by increasing the @xmath0 factor of the fabricated cavities . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : semtuning]a also shows the sensitivity plot for the measured cavity , defined as the change in the resonant wavelength for a given voltage change . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that by operating the system at @xmath14 v bias voltage , sensitivities as large as @xmath15 nm / v can be measured . in other words , in this regime , as little as a @xmath16 mv change in the bias voltage would result in a wavelength change larger than the full - width at half - maximum ( @xmath17 nm ) of the cavity resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this is advantageous for the realization of applications such as low - power optical switches and reconfigurable filters / routers . </S>",
    "<S> the high sensitivity of our devices can be attributed to two factors : ( i ) the dependence of the wavelength shift on the change in separation is intrinsically nonlinear  @xcite , and much larger shifts are obtained as the nanobeam separation becomes smaller , as in the case of higher voltages ; ( ii ) the electrostatic force experienced by the nanobeams is quadratic with the applied bias voltage as well as inversely - proportional to the nanobeam separation . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that in the steady state , when the system is reconfigured and the nanobeams are deflected to their final position , our system is not drawing any power from the bias source ( beyond what might result from leakage currents through the thick sio@xmath18 layer underneath the si device layer ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is of great practical interest for the realization of reconfigurable devices and systems , as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> the high sensitivities and high @xmath0 factors of coupled - phcnb cavities are also suitable for precision motion measurements in nems devices , since a strong modulation of the optical signal can be achieved , even for tiny displacements of the nanobeams . </S>",
    "<S> finally , coupled - phcnb cavities hold great promise for exciting applications involving the adiabatic wavelength conversion of light trapped in optical cavities  @xcite through mechanical motion .    </S>",
    "<S> [ hbtp ]    by utilizing an electrical feed - through port on a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , we were able to observe the real - time deflection of the devices due to the applied bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : semtuning]b shows sem images of the two nanobeams with increasing voltages applied across them . </S>",
    "<S> the images are shown for nanobeams with a large initial separation ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath20 nm , in order to render the motion of the nanobeams more distinctly . </S>",
    "<S> the bending of the nanobeams at the center of the structure can easily be observed , and matches well with our theoretical predictions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : geometry]c ) . after the pull - in voltage  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is exceeded , the two beams can become permanently stuck together due to van der waals interactions .  </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the difference in steady - state performance of our structures when operated in vacuum ( inside the sem chamber ) and in the atmospheric conditions ( resonant scattering setup ) is negligible , as in either case the structure is operated well below the breakdown voltage .    </S>",
    "<S> the current limitation to the tuning method employed here is the rc ( resistance @xmath21 capacitance ) time constant of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance offered by the silicon nanobeams is on the order of @xmath22 , resulting in time constants in the tens of seconds , despite the small capacitance of the structure . </S>",
    "<S> this could be readily improved by doping the silicon , albeit at the expense of the cavity @xmath0 factors ( due to increased material loss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the system could be further improved by utilizing alternative actuation methods  @xcite that do not depend on the rc time constant of the coupled nanobeams . in that case , the response time would be limited by the mechanical response , which is on the order of @xmath23 ns in the present design .    in summary , we have demonstrated reconfigurable optical filters that can be dynamically and reversibly tuned using electrostatic forces over @xmath24 nm wavelength range when less than 6 v of external bias voltage is applied to the structure . </S>",
    "<S> this work will serve as a basis for exciting applications ranging from ultra - sensitive motion detection to electrically actuated switching in optical circuits . </S>",
    "<S> the tuning method is stable and remarkably reproducible , provided that the voltage is not raised beyond the point of pull - in . by allowing precision wavelength trimming of devices , this method also provides higher tolerances for fabrication errors , enabling diverse applications in optomechanics , cavity quantum electrodynamics , and optical signal processing . </S>"
