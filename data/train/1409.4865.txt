    "quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) is one of the fascinating subjects in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "this is a new state of matter in magnetic insulators , which does not show long - range magnetic ordering down to zero temperature ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "vast experimental efforts have been made to realize this exotic state , and several candidates of qsls were proposed , for instance , in organic salts  @xcite and transition - metal oxides  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have also been performed for many models , e.g. , the heisenberg and hubbard models on geometrically frustrated lattices  @xcite . in spite of these intensive studies ,",
    "it remains controversial whether qsls are realized or not in the theoretical models , mainly because of the difficulty in numerical simulations , such as the negative sign problem in the quantum monte carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "the kitaev model is a quantum spin model consisting of @xmath2 spins  @xcite .",
    "this model is originally defined on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice composed of three types of bonds . on each bond ,",
    "the interaction between the nearest - neighbor spins is of ising type but the spin component of the interaction is different among the three types of bonds .",
    "this bond - dependent interaction brings about frustration ; namely , all the bond energies are not minimized simultaneously . due to the frustration effect",
    ", a magnetic order is suppressed down to zero @xmath1 and a nontrivial magnetic state emerges in the ground state .",
    "indeed , the ground state of the kitaev model is exactly proved to be a qsl  @xcite .",
    "depending on the anisotropy of the exchange interactions , both gapped and gapless qsls appear in the ground state  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this model provides a good starting point to reveal the intrinsic properties of qsls .",
    "in addition , it was proposed that the kitaev model is relevant also experimentally : the kitaev - type interaction may be realized between @xmath3 spins under the strong spin - orbit coupling in iridium oxides with a layered honeycomb lattice  @xcite .",
    "recently , related new iridium compounds , in which the iridium ions form a three - dimensional ( 3d ) network were synthesized in the chemical formula li@xmath4iro@xmath5 : the so - called hyperhoneycomb  @xcite and harmonic - honeycomb compounds  @xcite . in these 3d materials ,",
    "the kitaev - type interaction is also expected to be present .",
    "the discoveries have stimulated theoretical studies of the 3d kitaev physics  @xcite . among them , the authors and their collaborators have clarified the existence of finite-@xmath1 phase transitions between the low-@xmath1 qsls and the high-@xmath1 paramagnet by extensive numerical simulations  @xcite .    in this paper , we address the finite-@xmath1 properties of the kitaev model on a hyperhoneycomb lattice .",
    "this 3d kitaev model was first introduced in ref .",
    "one of the characteristics in the kitaev model is that this model can be exactly solvable at zero @xmath1 by rewriting it as a free majorana fermion system coupled with @xmath0 variables .",
    "we here focus on the effect of thermal fluctuations of the @xmath0 variables on the majorana fermion state .",
    "we calculate the @xmath1 dependence of the density of states ( dos ) of majorana fermions , and compare the results with the @xmath1 dependence of the specific heat of the total system .",
    "we find that the low - energy majorana spectrum exhibits characteristic @xmath1 dependence around the transition temperature between qsl and paramagnet .",
    "we show that the gapless behavior is eroded by thermal fluctuations of the @xmath0 fields above the critical temperature .",
    "we study the kitaev model on a hyperhoneycomb lattice , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are pauli matrices describing a spin-1/2 state at a site @xmath10 ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are exchange constants  @xcite .",
    "the model is defined on the hyperhoneycomb lattice shown in fig .",

    "the ground state of this model is obtained exactly , similarly in the 2d kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice  @xcite ; the phase diagram is completely the same as that of the 2d model , and consists of gapless and gapped qsl phases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_hyperhoneycomb](b )  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq:5 ] ) by an unbiased mc method .",
    "the method is based on the majorana fermion representation of the model , described below .",
    "first , we apply the jordan - wigner transformation by considering the 3d hyperhoneycomb lattice as a set of one - dimensional chains composed of @xmath14 and @xmath15 bonds .",
    "these chains are connected by the @xmath16 bonds with each other .",
    "a site @xmath10 on the hyperhoneycomb lattice can be represented by a pair of integers @xmath25 , where @xmath26 identifies a chain and @xmath27 is the site index on the @xmath26-th chain .",
    "then , by the jordan - wigner transformation , the spin operators are written by spinless fermion operators ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number operator defined by @xmath33 .",
    "the ising - type interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) are written as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . as the hyperhoneycomb lattice is bipartite , we term black ( @xmath37 ) and white ( @xmath38 ) sites so that the smaller-(larger-)@xmath27 site corresponds to the white ( black ) site on each @xmath14 bond as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_hyperhoneycomb](a ) .",

    "in addition , we introduced @xmath0 operators as @xmath48 on each @xmath16 bond @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "since all the @xmath0 operators commute with the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , the eigenstates of the system are characterized by the set of eigenvalues @xmath50 .",
    "note that we take open boundary conditions along the chains for avoiding a subtle boundary problem intrinsic to the jordan - wigner transformation .",

    "since the hamiltonian @xmath56 is given in a quadratic form in terms of the majorana fermion operators , it is easily diagonalized in the form of @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of a spinless fermion and @xmath60 is the number of lattice sites .",

    "the parameter @xmath22 is defined so as to satisfy @xmath23 and @xmath24 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig_hyperhoneycomb](b ) ] ; hence , the results in fig .  [ fig_dos ] are in the region where the ground state is gapless ( @xmath67 is critical ) .",

    "this critical value of @xmath22 is clearly larger than that at @xmath71 , @xmath87 .",
    "these results indicate that the majorana fermion gap opens with increasing @xmath1 in the region of @xmath88 .    in order to clarify how the dos evolves and the gap opens as @xmath1 increases , we calculate the thermal average of the dos in eq .",
