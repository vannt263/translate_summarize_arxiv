    "<S> the significant impact of quantum fluctuations is revealed .    </S>",
    "<S> 2 _ introduction _ escape over a high potential barrier driven by thermal noise is of fundamental interest in physics and chemistry @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> it is meanwhile well understood : after a transient period of time the decay is governed by a rate constant , which in the simplest classical case is of arrhenius type provided the decaying system stays in thermal equilibrium far from the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> what happens if due to additional external forces the system is far from thermal equilibrium ? </S>",
    "<S> this question has recently gained much attention for classical barrier transport in the strong damping limit ( smoluchowski limit ) . </S>",
    "<S> important examples are stochastic resonance @xcite , resonant activation in biochemical reactions and tunnel diodes @xcite , or directed motion in ratchet systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while even the classical physics of such phenomena is in many cases not yet completely explored , much less is known about corresponding quantum systems .    </S>",
    "<S> namely , in contrast to the classical range , tractable equations of motions of quantum dissipative systems also for strong damping and low temperatures do not exist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the path integral representation provides an exact expression for the time dependent density matrix , but even a numerical evaluation is in general prohibitive . </S>",
    "<S> particular progress has been made with the development of master equations @xcite and the quasiadiabtic propagator approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this way , extensive studies exist for bistable systems driven by external periodic forces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these and related techniques require  either to be valid or to be practicable  that energy level broadening due to friction remains sufficiently small ( depending on the approach ) so that for the relevant dynamics the hilbert space of the bare system can be reduced to a few lowest lying eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this condition fails in the domain of very strong friction . </S>",
    "<S> recently we showed @xcite that exactly in this range crucial simplifications arise : as in the classical smoluchowski limit , momentum equilibrates on time scales much faster than any other time scales ; accordingly , an equation of motion  </S>",
    "<S> the so - called quantum smoluchowski equation  can be derived for the position probability distribution from the exact path integral result . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of quantum fluctuations turns out to be substantial . </S>",
    "<S> hence , for the first time we are now in a position to explore driven barrier escape for arbitrary overdamped quantum systems @xcite .    here , we focus on two paradigmatic examples , namely , a bistable potential with a barrier fluctuating randomly in time and a metastable well driven by a periodic monochromatic force . </S>",
    "<S> classically , for the first case the phenomenon of resonant activation is characteristic , while for the second one a substantial rate enhancement by driving is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the significant impact of quantum fluctuations on both processes .    </S>",
    "<S> _ quantum smoluchowski_for a systems coupled to a heat bath environment the reduced density matrix follows from @xmath0 where tr@xmath1 denotes the trace over bath degrees of freedom and @xmath2 is the time dependent density matrix of the system+bath compound . within the path integral </S>",
    "<S> approach a formally exact expression for the position representation @xmath3 can be given @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now , in @xcite it was shown that within the quantum - smoluchowski range ( qsr ) , i.e.   @xmath4 the position distribution @xmath5 is well determined by a simple time evolution equation coined quantum smoluchowski equation ( qse ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 denotes the friction constant , @xmath7 the ground state frequency in a potential @xmath8 , and @xmath9 inverse temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is opposite to the classical smoluchowski range where @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the qse reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 \\label{qmsmolu}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> further , @xmath15 accounts for the dominating impact of quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , the dynamics of an overdamped quantum systems can be seen as a classical smoluchowski dynamics with an effective potential @xmath16 and an effective diffusion term @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> note that quantum fluctuations in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qmsmolu ] ) are of order @xmath18 and thus , are much larger than classical finite friction corrections which are of order @xmath19 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> static barriers_we first recall results for the decay rate in static barrier potentials . </S>",
    "<S> there , adjacent to the barrier at @xmath20 we assume a well region around a minimum at @xmath21 such that the barrier height @xmath22 obeys @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we take smooth potentials for granted . </S>",

    "<S> let us now turn to barrier potentials driven by external forces .    </S>",
    "<S> _ fluctuating barriers_thermally activated diffusion over a potential barrier that fluctuates randomly in time has evoked much interest recently . in the classical smoluchowski limit </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the interplay between relaxation , by thermally activated barrier passage , and fluctuation , by correlated external noise , leads to a strongly enhanced reaction rate in the resonant activation regime @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present the first study to this phenomena for corresponding quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> we look at the process of dichotomous barrier fluctuations with a rate @xmath26 in a symmetric double well and search for the ultimate decay rate @xmath27 of relaxation to equilibrium . since for this problem an analytical classical theory was derived @xcite , we can adapt the general technique . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the case of high barriers considered here , it was shown that rates from the analytical theory are in excellent agreement with numerically exact results @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if the potential flips randomly between two surfaces @xmath28 and @xmath29 at a rate @xmath26 , we need two probability densities @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 [ @xmath33 being the density to find a particle at time @xmath34 at position @xmath35 and the potential in state @xmath28 [ @xmath29 ] . accordingly , the two - dimensional qse reads @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 here , @xmath40 with potentials @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath42 describes the barrier modulations and is assumed to have the following properties : it is symmetric around the barrier top at @xmath20 and monotone decreasing away from it ; outside some finite range around the top it is zero . in particular , @xmath43 around the well minima located at @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> further , its maximum @xmath45 is small compared to the barrier height @xmath46 but not necessarily small compared to @xmath47 . the ultimate decay rate @xmath27 is now defined as the least negative eigenvalue to the operator @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ankerhold1 ]    in the adiabatic range of small @xmath26 , qualitatively , there is no much change to the classical result . </S>",
    "<S> after each flip the system has enough time to relax to equilibrium inside the well regions of the instantaneous potentials . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the rate follows as the least negative eigenvalue of @xmath48 when replacing the operators @xmath49 by the static quantum rates @xmath50 for the individual potentials , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qserate ] ) . hence , similarly to the classical rate we obtain @xmath51^{1/2}. \\label{adia}\\ ] ] as expected @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> more interesting is the region of moderate to fast barrier flippings , i.e. @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> there , the procedure is to solve @xmath56 with the boundary condition @xmath57 so that due to symmetry @xmath58 . this way , we solve the equation for the equilibrium eigenfunction , i.e.  with zero eigenvalue , but under boundary conditions corresponding to the relaxation eigenfunction with the least negative eigenvalue . as long as @xmath27 is the smallest frequency in the system this approximation is justified . </S>",
    "<S> now , in the limit of a high barrier we employ a semiclassical type of ansatz @xmath59 with an effective potential @xmath60 and a prefactor accounting for terms of higher order in @xmath47 . to obtain the dominant exponential contribution </S>",
    "<S> we do the following : the two coupled second order differential equations corresponding to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fluc1e ] ) are transformed to four coupled equations of first order . </S>",
    "<S> this linear system is solved by diagonalizing the coefficient matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant eigenvalue turns out to be @xmath61 and is determined by the solution to the cubic equation @xmath62 obeying @xmath63 . here , we introduced effective potentials which are related to the bare potentials by @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , by formally putting @xmath66 in ( [ cubic ] ) one regains the known classical result @xcite . for the prefactor </S>",
    "<S> we solve perturbatively the differential equations @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> since this scheme works similarly as in the classical case we refer to the literature for further details @xcite .    for the rate one first derives from @xmath68 that @xmath69/\\{m\\gamma\\beta\\int [ p_++p_-]\\}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> then , inserting the results for @xmath70 we gain @xmath71\\ , { \\rm e}^{-\\beta \\phi(q_b)}\\ , { \\rm e}^{\\lambda\\beta [ u''(q_0)-|\\phi''(q_b)|/2]}\\label{flucrate}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath73 coincides with the classical result @xcite and thus , its lengthy expression is omitted here </S>",
    "<S> . however , quantum fluctuations strongly affect the dominant exponential factor . in the limits of very slow and very fast barrier fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74-dependent terms lead basically to a renormalization of temperature . for small @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> we derive from eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> results are displayed in figs .  1 , 2 . </S>",
    "<S> besides an obvious rate increase , the major effects of quantum fluctuations are to _ substantially decrease _ the relative height as well as the width of the resonant activation maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the shrinking relative height @xmath80 is a consequence of effectively reduced barrier modulations @xmath81 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the decreasing width of the plateau range is ascribed for sufficiently large @xmath26 to the fact that then quantum fluctuations on the left hand side in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cubic ] ) lead to an effectively enhanced flipping rate @xmath82 $ ] near the barrier top . for intermediate fluctuation rates </S>",
    "<S> the cubic equation ( [ cubic ] ) gives rise to a nonlinear dependence on @xmath74 leading to an intimate relation between external barrier fluctuations and intrinsic quantum fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> _ oscillating barriers_a prominent example for a system far from equilibrium is a metastable potential driven periodically by an external force . </S>",
    "<S> recently , in the classical smoluchowski limit , decay rates were studied for weak and moderate to strong driving as well @xcite . here , we explore the corresponding quantum problem by calculating numerically the time dependent decay rate @xmath83 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qmsmolu ] ) for long times . </S>",
    "<S> the time dependent potential is chosen as @xmath84 with a static barrier @xmath85 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the static barrier top is located at @xmath86 , the well minimum at @xmath87 , and the static height is @xmath88 . for the driven case ( @xmath89 ) the location of the barrier top moves periodically in time with @xmath90 . consequently , as in the classical case </S>",
    "<S> , the rate @xmath91 with @xmath92 also oscillates in time . </S>",
    "<S> then , from @xmath12 we derive up to negligible corrections @xmath93)\\frac{\\partial_q p[q_b(t),t]}{n(t)}.\\label{oscirate}\\ ] ] note that for high barriers and times @xmath94 one can put @xmath95 if initially one starts from a normalized distribution @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ankerhold3 ]    high precision numerical results based on the qse [ eq .  ( [ qmsmolu ] ) ] are shown in fig .  3 for the time dependent rate @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> apart from a rate enhancement the influence of quantum fluctuation is two - fold : first , @xmath83 tends to be more symmetric around its minima and maxima and second , both extrema are slightly shifted to the left . in @xcite lehmann et al .  </S>",
    "<S> developed a nice theory for the pure classical case ( @xmath66 ) based on an asymptotic expansion for @xmath25 ( for a related theory see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> there , one finds a weak dependence of the location of the extrema on temperature . since locally in position space </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath74 dependence can be partially incorporated in an effective temperature , we attribute the observed shift in the quantum case to a similar kind of process . however , what is not possible is to mimic the numerical data for finite @xmath74 by an effective temperature only .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ankerhold4 ]    the averaged rate @xmath97 as a function either of inverse temperature or driving amplitude is depicted in figs .  4 , 5 . </S>",
    "<S> again the rate enhancement is significant . interestingly , while on a logarithmic scale the classical rate shows a simple linear behavior as a function of @xmath98 for sufficiently low temperatures ( according to the well - known exponential arrhenius law ) , the quantum rate exhibits a weak nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> of course , in the high temperature limit quantum corrections become negligible . as a function of the driving amplitude the difference between quantum and classical rate shrinks with increasing amplitude . as for strong </S>",
    "<S> driving most of the escape happens to occur when the barrier is low and thus , is much less effective in hindering the transport , the effect of a @xmath74 induced rate enhancement due to a smaller barrier height in @xmath99 is diminished .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ankerhold5 ]    what about an analytical theory ? </S>",
    "<S> we think that in principle the classical theory @xcite can be generalized to the quantum case , a detailed analysis , however , still needs substantial work . </S>",
    "<S> even then seems an explicit evaluation in closed analytical form for all realistic potentials prohibitive . </S>",
    "<S> our intention here is to give for a highly non - trivial example a first account about the significant role of quantum fluctuations in the qsr .    to summarize we have studied for two important examples quantum transport over driven barrier potentials in the strong friction limit . for the case of a fluctuating bistable potential </S>",
    "<S> we explored the impact of quantum fluctuations on the resonant activation phenomenon . in a case of a metastable potential driven externally by a periodic force we found a sensitive behavior of the decay rate on the relevant parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these notables findings may stimulate further studies of the quantum smoluchowski equation in physics and chemistry as well . </S>"
