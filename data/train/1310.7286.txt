    "since the number of quanta is conserved in this hybrid system , three mutually exclusive possibilities are involved in the one - quantum subspace : ( 1 ) the particle freely propagates in the two crws ; ( 2 ) the particle is absorbed by the atom , consequently , the atom is populated in its excited state ; ( 3 ) the classical field stimulates the atom into its intermediate state .",

    "these total reflections are caused by the quantum interference between the spontaneous emission from the atom and the propagating modes in the 1d continuum .",
    "the waves emitted by the doubly - dressed states interfere coherently , such that the back - traveling wave is eliminated while the forward wave is constructed , which leads to the perfect transmission of the incident photon .",
    "the transmission spectra at @xmath225 and @xmath226 indicate that the atom is transparent once the classical field is applied .",
    "hence , we can control the reflection and transmission by tuning the rabi frequency and the classical field frequency for waves incident from the bright crw .",
    "hence , we denote the bright channel as the controllable channel .",
    "it should be noted that the propagating states of the bright channel are orthogonal to those of the dark channel .",
    "we have studied the coherent scattering process of single photons in two 1d crws .",
    "the scattering target is a @xmath2-type atom possessing an inversion center , which fulfill the quantum routing of single photons due to quantum interference .",
    "when there is an overlap between two bands of the crws , the resonant tunneling process induces the atom to act as a multi - channel router . when the classical field is absent , one can turn - on the multi - channel routing by adjusting the transition frequency of the atom between the states @xmath9 and @xmath7 to match the desired propagating states of both crws . to turn off the multi - channel routing",
    ", one has to tune the atomic transition energy far away from the energy of the incident photons .",
    "obviously , the closure of the multi - channel routing based on large detuning is not perfect . to perfectly turn off the quantum routing",
    ", one can utilize the autler - townes splitting .",
    "the procedures are as follows : first , applying a classical field to drive the transition between the excited state of the atom and an intermediate level , then adjusting the frequency and the intensity of the classical field .",
    "in addition , the scatter - free and controllable channel are found for waves incident from both crws .",
    "single photons propagate freely in the scatter - free channel . without the classical field ,",
    "the atom acts only as a perfect mirror for incident waves in the controllable channel due to the fano resonance . with the classical field applied , the atom acts not only as a perfect mirror but also as a transparent medium , i.e. , the classical field selects the photon which is transmitted or reflected .    when there is no overlap between the two bands , the coupling between discrete energy levels and a continuum makes the atom act as a single - channel router . when the classical field is absent , the single - channel router is turned on by adjusting the atomic transition frequency between states @xmath9 and @xmath7 , so that the bound state in one crw matches the incident energy of the other crw . to turn off the single - channel router",
    ", one has to adjust the atomic transition frequency @xmath144 so that the bound states of the crw are far away from the other crw .",
    "however , this mechanism for turning - off the single - channel router is not perfect . with the classical field applied",
