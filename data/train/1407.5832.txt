    "the aim of this paper is to study the statistical properties of a natural point process on the sphere where the points exhibit repulsive behavior .",
    "this point process was introduced in @xcite and is known as spherical ensemble ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model was studied earlier in @xcite and @xcite , but without observing the connection to random matrices .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that there exists a connection between this model and the one - component plasma on the sphere for a special value of temperature .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be independent @xmath3 random matrices with independent and identically distributed standard complex gaussian entries , and let @xmath4 denotes the set of eigenvalues of @xmath5 . we can consider these eigenvalues as a ( simple ) random point process on complex plane @xmath6 . the point process @xmath7 can be described using the _ @xmath8-point correlation functions @xmath9 _ , @xmath10 , defined in such a way that @xmath11 for all continuous , compactly supported functions @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the lebesgue measure on the complex plane @xmath6 .",
    "krishnapur @xcite showed that this random point process is a determinantal point process on complex plane with kernel @xmath15 with respect to the background measure @xmath16 , i.e. we have @xmath17_{i , j=1}^{k}\\ ] ] for every @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we note here that a random point process is said to be a _",
    "determinantal point process _ if its @xmath8-point correlation functions have determinantal form similar to ( [ eqn : determinantal form ] ) .",
    "the corresponding kernel @xmath20 is called a correlation kernel of the determinantal point process .",
    "we refer to @xcite or @xcite and references therein for more information on deteminantal point processes .",
    "let @xmath21 be the unit two - dimensional sphere centred at the origin in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath22 .",
    "also we let @xmath23 denotes the lebesgue surface area measure on this sphere with total measure @xmath24 . as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "these eigenvalues are best thought of as points on @xmath0 , using stereographic projection .",
    "let @xmath25 be the stereographic projection of the sphere @xmath0 from the north pole onto the plane @xmath26 .",
    "if we let @xmath27 for @xmath28 then the vector @xmath29 , in uniform random order , has the joint density @xmath30 with respect to lebesgue measure on @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the euclidean distance between two points @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that this density is similar to the circular unitary ensemble case and clearly this point process is invariant in distribution under the isometries of @xmath0 .",
    "consider the point process on @xmath0 , @xmath35 we know that @xmath36 converges almost surely to the uniform measure on the sphere .",
    "in fact , it is also true in the more general case : let @xmath37 and @xmath38 be independent @xmath3 random matrices with i.i.d entries with mean 0 and variance 1 , and let @xmath39 denotes the set of eigenvalues of @xmath40 . based on the results of @xcite , bordenave @xcite shows that @xmath41 converges almost surely to uniform measure on @xmath0 as @xmath42    moreover from the repulsive nature of determinantal point processes we expect that the points of process @xmath43 are typically more evenly distributed than @xmath44 independently chosen uniform points on the sphere .",
    "this repelling property is the common feature of many models in random matrix theory and has been comprehensively studied in some special models such as the gaussian unitary or the circular unitary ensembles .",
    "for example , the distribution or the minimum or the maximum of the gaps between consecutive eigenvalues have been computed and compared to simpler models as a way to measure and understand the repulsive structure .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to do the same computations for the spherical model .",
    "we specially focus on the minimum distance between the points , the area of the largest empty cap , the hole probability and the limiting distribution of the nearest neighbors distances as natural two - dimensional extensions of the so called metrics studied in one dimensional models .",
    "on the other hand we exploit this model and its properties to the classic problem of distributing points on the sphere .",
    "the problem of distributing a given number of points on the surface of a sphere `` uniformly '' , is a challenging and old problem .",
    "contrary to the one dimensional case ( i.e. distributing points on a circle ) where the most uniform arrangement clearly exists and is attained when the points are equidistributed , it seems that there is no arrangement on the sphere that can be considered as completely uniform , and the answer for the best arrangement depends on what criteria do we use to quantify the uniformity of an arrangement . among the mostly used criteria are those related to the electrostatic potential energy and its generalizations where one tries to distribute the points in a way that minimizes some energy function .",
    "another common metric is the discrepancy that measures the maximum deviance between the number of points and the expected number , in some class of regions in the underlying space ( sphere , in our case ) .",
    "both the energy and the discrepancy optimization problems , i.e. finding the most optimum arrangement or even obtaining some relatively sharp upper and lower bounds are open and challenging problems for the sphere .",
    "we study these metrics ( discrepancy and riesz energies ) to measure the uniformity of points of @xmath43 .",
    "for each of these metrics we obtain some bounds and investigate the asymptotic behavior when the number of points tends to infinity .",
    "it is remarkable that though the model is random , because of the repelling property of the points , the behavior can be proved to be as good as the best known constructions ( for discrepancy ) or even better than the best known constructions ( for riesz energies ) .",
    "the main results of the paper are stated in the next subsection , together with definition and some properties of the metrics discussed above .",
    "the geometrically most natural measure for the uniformity of the distribution of an @xmath44-point set on @xmath0 is the _ spherical cap discrepancy_. let @xmath45 be an @xmath44-point set on @xmath0 .",

    "the asymptotic expansion of this variance and the proof of theorem [ thm : discrepancy ] will be presented in section 2 .",
    "given @xmath58 , define the covering radius of @xmath46 as the infimum of the numbers @xmath59 such that every point of @xmath0 is within distance @xmath60 of some @xmath61 .",
    "if we let @xmath62 be the covering radius of @xmath46 , then the area of the largest spherical cap which does not contain any point of @xmath46 in its interior is equal to @xmath63 ( note that , for fixed @xmath64 , the area of the spherical cap @xmath65 is @xmath66 ) . we will be interested in studying the asymptotic behavior of the area of the largest empty cap for the spherical ensemble .",

    "the desired asymptotics of the hole probability will be given in lemma [ prop : hole probability ] .",

    "notice that for independent uniform points on @xmath0 , the area of largest empty cap is of order @xmath71 .",
    "at the end of section 3 we study the nearest neighbour statistics of spherical ensemble and show a connection between the local behavior of this model and the ginibre ensemble .      in section 4 , we compute the expectations of the logarithmic energy and riesz @xmath72-energy of the random point process @xmath43 on @xmath0 .",
