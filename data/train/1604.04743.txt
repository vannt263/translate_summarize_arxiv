    "the dearth of spectrum in the conventional ultra - high frequency ( uhf ) bands coupled with increasing wireless traffic has led industry and academia to consider employing ehf or mmwave as one of the candidate technologies for the next generation of wireless access networks ( or  5 g \" ) @xcite .",
    "given that electromagnetic waves can not travel around obstacles with the dimensions exceeding their wavelength , numerous objects ( like humans , buildings , etc . ) in the environment , which did not affect uhf signals significantly , would lead to propagation losses for mmwave transmissions @xcite . as high wireless traffic demand areas , attractive for deploying mmwave wireless networks , tend to be highly populated too ( e.g. , city square , mall , etc . ) , characterizing the effect of humans around the receiver on the mmwave signal blockage is quite important .",
    "although there has been considerable progress in channel modeling for mmwave @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the investigation on blockage modeling for mmwave has been limited . in @xcite ,",
    "a model was proposed to characterize the blocking of the line of sight ( los ) path by buildings . in the proposed model ,",
    "the receiver dimension was assumed to be infinitesimally - small and the blockers ( those high enough to block los ) were distributed uniformly , without considering alternative deployment patterns .",
    "the derived model was quite similar to the exponential distance dependent decay approaches traditionally used in 3gpp urban outdoor micro - cellular model @xcite and proposed in the context of mmwave in @xcite .",
    "another simple ball based blocking model for buildings was proposed in @xcite .",
    "coverage and capacity obtained from these aforementioned models was compared with that obtained from real building data in @xcite .",
    "compared to uhf , communications in mmwave networks are expected to operate over shorter distances and in crowded urban environments @xcite .",
    "since the height of the transmitter could be much lower than that of traditional base stations ( bs ) , humans surrounding the receiver can act as blockers to signal propagation .",
    "hence , in addition to the heights of the receiver and the transmitter , the distance between them , and the spatial dimensions of blocking objects , the random heights of humans also need to be accounted for .",
    "further , due to much smaller distances between the transmitter and the receiver , and accounting for the possible antenna arrays at the receiver @xcite , the linear dimensions of the receiver may be non - negligible in practice .",
    "none of the prior works address these issues in their models . in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel and tractable model for characterizing the probability of human - body blockage .",
    "the proposed model represents humans as cylinders with arbitrarily distributed heights and radii , whose centers follow the poisson point process ( ppp ) in two dimensions . employing the tools from stochastic geometry and renewal processes , the blockage probability of the los path between transmitter - receiver",
    "is derived as a function of receiver dimension and the transmitter - receiver separation .",
    "the case with infinitesimal receiver dimensions is a special scenario of the developed analysis .",
    "the proposed model is validated by comparing with the blocking probability obtained from detailed mmwave ray - launching simulations , which in turn lends credence to the offered design insights . using our analysis ,",
    "the optimal height of the mmwave transmitter in crowded outdoor environments is derived and shown to be proportional to the transmitter - receiver separation .",
    "consider the scenario illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : analytic](a , b ) .",
    "there is a tx located at a certain height @xmath0 above the ground and a rx located at the height @xmath1 .",
    "the base of the rx is at the distance @xmath2 from the base of the tx .",
    "the potential blockers , humans , are distributed over the landscape .",
    "we model the blockers as cylinders @xcite with a certain height , @xmath3 , and the base diameter of @xmath4 .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are random variables ( rvs ) .",
    "it is known that the distribution of the height for men and women is normal with the mean and the standard deviation provided in @xcite . following @xcite , the mixture of users",
    "is closely approximated by the normal distribution @xmath5 .",
    "generally , any distribution could be used to provide a result based on the current methodology .",
    "the rv @xmath4 is assumed to be uniformly - distributed between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the centers of cylinder bases follow a matern hard - core point process on the plane with the intensity @xmath8 .",
    "the length of the rx is assumed to be @xmath9 m . in summary ,",
    "the main parameters and the description of the employed notation are given in table [ tab : analysis_parameters ] . in",
    "what follows , our main metric of interest is the probability of blockage for both the non - infinitesimal and infinitesimal receiver .      to represent the centers of blockers on the landscape , we employ the matern hard - core process ensuring that the locations of blockers do not overlap . using the results of @xcite",
    ", the matern process can be replaced by the equivalent poisson process for a wide range of intensities @xmath8 .",
    "further , observe that for different values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the distribution of the blocker heights @xmath3 , not all the blockers affect the los between the tx and rx .",
    "the number of blockers should increase as the @xmath10-coordinate grows from @xmath11 to @xmath2 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : analytic_c ] .",
    "the spatially - varying intensity of centers of blockers along the radial lines that may potentially affect the los between the tx and rx is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a function describing the distance between the line @xmath14 and @xmath15 at @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath13 is linear , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the tangent of @xmath13 with respect to the positive direction of @xmath15 , while @xmath18 is the height of a function at @xmath19 .",
    "we thus have    @xmath20    the probability @xmath21 for each @xmath10 is a complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) of @xmath3 .",

    "the resulting process is non - homogeneous , but still poisson , with spatially - varying intensity along the radial lines , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the intensity @xmath26 is minimal at @xmath19 and increases non - linearly as @xmath10 grows .",
    "consider now the projection of the blocker centers along the radial lines , represented by points on the circumference of the circle with radius @xmath2 and center at tx , see fig .",

    "it is easy to prove that the process of projections on the circumference is homogeneous poisson , as it has a poisson distribution of projections in any bounded arc that depends only on the length of an arc and satisfies the independence property of the poisson process .        to establish the intensity of blocker centers at the circumference ,",
    "consider the arc with length @xmath27 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : up ] .",

    "although this integral can not be expressed in elementary functions due to the error function in @xmath25 , it can be easily computed numerically with any required accuracy .    to this end , we have characterized the point process of the centers of blockers .",
    "further , the distribution of a `` shadow '' created by an individual blocker at circumference is given .",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : up1 ] , which shows the top view of our scenario .",
    "observe that for @xmath32 , where @xmath2 is the distance from the base of tx to rx , we could replace the arc @xmath33 by a chord @xmath34 . from the geometric properties ,",
    "we arrive at @xmath35 , that is , a rv denoting the length of a shadow as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath4 are the rvs denoting the distance from the tx to a blocker and the width of a blocker , respectively . recalling the principles of linear transformation of rvs @xcite , the numerator of ( [ eqn:007 ] ) reads as @xmath38       consider now the denominator of ( [ eqn:007 ] ) .",
    "recall that the intensity of blockers increases along the radial lines according to ( [ eqn:001 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the probability to have a blocker increases as we move from @xmath19 to @xmath39 . the density to have a blocker at @xmath10 conditioned on the event that there is a blocker shall increase proportionally to @xmath25 , as obtained in ( [ eqn:004 ] ) , and the only aspect we have to determine calculating the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath37 is the normalization constant , such that the area under @xmath40 over @xmath41 is exactly @xmath42 .",
    "it can be found as @xmath43\\right)dx,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and normalized to obtain @xmath44    now , to determine the pdf of the shadow , we have to find the ratio between the rv @xmath45 and @xmath37 , whose densities are given by ( [ eqn:008 ] ) and ( [ eqn:010 ] ) . since these rvs are independent , the ratio is formally offered by @xcite    @xmath46    the integral ( [ eqn:011 ] ) can not be solved in elementary functions due to the density of @xmath37 in ( [ eqn:010 ] ) .",
    "however , one can compute the distribution of @xmath35 numerically .",
    "consider now the rx of length @xmath9 . in practice",
    ", it corresponds to when more than a single antenna is used at the user equipment and/or the distance between the bases of the tx and rx , @xmath2 , is relatively small . in this case",
    ", we have to take into account the length of the rx explicitly and the task at hand reduces to expressing the probability that an arc of a constant non - zero width @xmath9 is fully covered by arcs of random length , whose center points follow a poisson process with the intensity @xmath47 as found in ( [ eqn:005 ] ) and with the length pdf @xmath48 provided by ( [ eqn:011 ] ) .",
    "consider the projections of blockers on the circumference as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : up ] .",

    "it is easy to show that not only the projections of the centers of blockers , but also their left- and right - hand side projections , form a stationary poisson process on the line with the intensity @xmath47 .",
    "the superposed process of all projections forms a renewal process with the alternating blocked and unblocked parts .",

    "[ fig : plot2 ] demonstrates the blockage probability for the interval rx across different ratios of the rx size and the mean blocker diameter @xmath87 , as well as the distance between the bases of tx and rx @xmath2 .",

    "intuitively , the higher the height is , the smaller the probability of the los blockage should be .",

    "the presence of the los signal path is crucial in determining the ultimate performance of the 5g - grade mmwave wireless communications , especially in highly - crowded outdoor environments . using the ray - launching simulator",
    ", we first demonstrated that the difference between the los and non - los path loss values is at least @xmath89 db .",
    "moreover , due to shorter ranges of mmwave cellular technology , smaller obstacles will affect the corresponding quality of signal propagation .",
    "all of the above leads to the need of having a comprehensive analytical methodology for determining the presence of the los link .",
    "however , existing approaches , such as 3gpp urban outdoor micro - cellular model , do not deliver the desired detalization .",
    "this substantiates the importance of our conducted los - centric analysis .",
    "to this end , we developed a novel framework for capturing the effects of the most important mmwave system parameters on the probability of blockage for both the infinitesimal receiver and the receiver of a fixed non - zero length .",
    "as a result , it was shown that an increase in the ratio between the length of the rx and the blocker sizes leads to a closer match between the two .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated the existence of the optimal tx height , which is an important learning for system designers .",
    "the studied parameters of interest included the distance between the bases of the tx and rx and their heights , as well as the density of blockers on the landscape and their random dimensions .",
