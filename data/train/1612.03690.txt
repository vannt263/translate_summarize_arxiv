    "the theory of open quantum systems allows a description of the open dynamics in terms of the features of the external environment @xcite .",

    "the interaction between the open system and the external environment consists in a frequency dependent linear coupling between each mode and the degrees of freedom of the open system .",
    "the open dynamic is fully characterized by the spectral density ( sd ) of the system . for the sake of clarity we report below a brief description of these quantities and refer to @xcite for details .",
    "the total hamiltomian @xmath0 of the open system and the external environment is usually described by the following form , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the microscopic hamiltonian of the open system that acts on the corresponding hilbert space @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "the spectral density ( sd ) of the system @xmath15 is defined via the coupling constants as follows , @xmath16 this function encodes information about the environment , via the mode frequencies , and about the interaction between open system and environment , via the coupling constants .",
    "the open dynamics is influenced by the temporal correlations among the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "these effects are stored in the bath correlation ( bcf ) .",
    "if the external environment is a thermal bath at temperature @xmath17 , if no correlation exists initially between the open system and the thermal bath , and if the stationarity condition holds , the bcf is expressed in terms of the sd by the following form , @xmath18 in units where the planck constant @xmath19 and boltzmann constant @xmath20 equal unity , @xmath21 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a powerful technique has been developed for the analytical evaluation of the bcf by fitting the sd via a class of simple functions . in this way , the bcf is represented as a sum of damped harmonic oscillations .",
    "this form is useful for the description of the reduced dynamics of open quantum systems .",
    "the method allows the evaluation of the bcf for a large variety of sds that include the ohmic and super - ohmic condition and forms appearing in models of photosynthetic light harvesting complexes , to name a few .    as a continuation of the scenario described above , here , we consider a general class of sds that exhibit at low frequencies logarithmic factors in addition to the ohmic - like structure .",
    "these terms are represented by arbitrarily positive or negative powers of logarithmic functions .",
    "the corresponding logarithmic singularities are removable and provide sds that are arbitrarily shaped at higher frequencies .",
    "we analyze the short and long time behavior of the bcf in dependence on the low and high frequency structured of these sds , that include and continuously depart from the ohmic - like condition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ 3 ] , the short and long time behavior of the bcf is evaluated analytically in terms of the low or high frequency structure and integral properties of the sd .",

    "for the sake of convenience , the sds under study are described via the dimensionless auxiliary function @xmath22 .",
    "this function is defined for every @xmath23 by the following scaling property , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a typical scale frequency of the system . the first class of sds under study is defined by auxiliary functions that are continuous for every @xmath26 and exhibit the following asymptotic behavior @xcite as @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 for every @xmath32 , and @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",

    "the logarithmic singularity in @xmath41 is removed by defining @xmath42 .",
