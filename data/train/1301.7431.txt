    "the search for planets around stars other than the sun has revealed a great diversity of both planet mass and location .",
    "jovian mass planets have been discovered both in very short period orbits ( mayor & queloz 1995 , butler et al .",
    "1997 ) , at distances more characteristic of the planets in our own solar system ( butler & marcy 1996 ; boisse et al .",
    "2012 ) , at great distances from their host stars ( udalski et al . 2005 ; gaudi et al . 2008 ; kalas et al . 2008 ; marois et al . 2008 , 2010 ) and potentially even as free floating objects ( sumi et al .",
    "lower mass planets are harder to detect , but planets in the uranus / neptune mass range ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) have also been found with a range of semimajor axes , both close in ( howard et al .",

    "furthermore , multiple detection techniques are now able to probe below @xmath3 ( wolszczan & frail 1992 ; mcarthur et al .",

    "2009 ; queloz et al .",
    "2009 ; mayor et al . 2009 ; batalha et al . 2011 ) , potentially delving into the regime of true terrestrial planet formation .",
    "indeed , the number of planet candidates emerging from the kepler satellite data suggests that this class may soon dominate the demographics of known extrasolar planets ( borucki et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the origin of these different classes of planet is still a matter of active discussion .",
    "the presence of so - called hot jupiters close to their parent stars was initially held to be securely described within the context of planetary migration ( lin , bodenheimer & richardson 1996 ) , in which giant planets form at distances @xmath5 several  au , and migrate inwards due to torques from the gaseous protoplanetary disk ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; ward 1997 ) . the discovery of significant misalignments between the planetary orbital angular momenta and the stellar star host spin ( winn et al .",
    "2010 and historical references therein ) has cast some doubt on the applicability of this model to at least some of the observed systems , reviving interest in such mechanisms as planetary scattering ( rasio & ford 1996 ; nagasawa & ida 2011 ) or kozai migration ( wu & murray 2003 ; fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ; naoz et al .",
    "another significant problem for the migration paradigm is the fact that both radial velocity and transit methods find neptune mass planets in a part of parameter space that such models predicted to be devoid of planets ( ida & lin 2008 ) .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that migration does not occur , but it does indicate that current models are either not universally applicable or are missing one or more crucial elements .",
    "such advances have spurred new interest in the origin of low mass planets around other stars , and generated alternative proposals .",
    "it is possible that such planets did migrate inwards but were subject to additional perturbations , either from mutual gravitational interactions ( terquem & papaloizou 2007 ; ida & lin 2010 ) or some other , stochastic , forcing ( rein 2012 ) , in order to match the observed period ratio distribution in multiple systems .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that intense stellar irradiation can evaporate the envelopes of hot jupiter planets , leaving behind only the neptune - mass stellar core ( baraffe et al .",
    "however , current estimates of the evaporation rates for known jupiter planets ( ehrenreich & desert 2011 ) suggest that these do not compose a viable progenitor population .    instead",
    ", hansen & murray ( 2011 ) propose that this population is the result of in situ assembly of rocky planets , which may capture substantial , but not dominant , gaseous envelopes if they grow to sufficient size before the gaseous disk disperses .",
    "this proposal has the advantage that it naturally produces multiple planet systems , as are observed , and furthermore matches the statistical properties of the observed multiple planet systems .    the original intent of the hansen & murray ( 2011 ) proposal was to match the planets observed in the radial velocity surveys descibed in howard et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and mayor et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which represent the tip of the iceberg of the low mass planet sample , by virtue of the detection limits inherent in the rv method .",
    "however , the kepler mission ( borucki et al . 2011 ) has begun to expose more of the iceberg , suggesting that there are many systems with lower mass planets , offering the possibility of further testing the in situ assembly model . in particular , these lower mass planets most likely did not substantially increase their masses by accreting gas from the nebula and so should represent a more straightforward test of the model , without uncertainties in the treatment of gas accretion .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we perform a quantitative comparison of in situ assembly models with a planetary candidate sample culled from the kepler satellite data , under the assumption that these are primarily rocky planets and that their organization reflects the conditions that emerge directly from the gravitational assembly of the planetary system .    in   [ sim ]",
    "we describe our model for the original rocky protoplanetary disk , and its assembly into the final planetary configuration .",
    "we also develop statistical descriptions for the distribution of various important quantities , such as planetary masses and mutual inclinations which are then used to simulate the distribution of a large population of planetary systems in a monte carlo fashion , and to quantify their observability when studied in the manner of a search for transits .",
    "these are then compared to a well - defined subset of the kepler candidates in   [ obs ] and the implications",
    "are discussed in ",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "hansen & murray ( 2011 ) , hereafter hm11 , simulated the assembly of planets for a variety of rocky disks , with masses ranging up @xmath6 within 1  au , and accounting for both purely rocky systems and for the accretion of substantial amounts of gas from the surrounding nebula .",
    "this was dictated by a desire to match systems detected in radial velocity surveys , whose masses suggest rock - to - gas ratios of order unity ( and whose existence is born out by a handful of transiting systems , such as hd149026b , hat - p-11 and kepler-9b , c ) . however , statistical analyses of the kepler sample ( e.g. howard et al .",
    "2012 , youdin 2011 ) suggest that this population contains a substantial contribution from bodies whose mass is predominantly rocky , even if their radii are inflated by a minority component ( by mass ) of gas .",
    "therefore , this new sample , by virtue of its size and different detection technique , offers a new test of planetary origin models .",
    "our model for the origin of these planetary systems is that the final assembly stage from planetary embryos to final planets occurred in situ , with the masses and separations of the final planets determined by the gravitational interactions between the assembling bodies . whether the planetary embryos are formed from rocky material that condensed out of the gas in situ or migrated inwards as small bodies is not specified , and may be a function of total disk mass . in hm11 , the disk masses assumed were in excess of 30@xmath7 and most likely did require an enhancement over the heavy element inventory of the original local gas disk .",
    "however , for lower mass disks , such inward migration may not be necessary .",
    "our model for the origin of the observed kepler systems has a surface density profile @xmath8 , normalised to contain @xmath1 of rocky material interior to 1  au , around a 1@xmath9 star .",
    "this is chosen to be a lower mass version of the density profile that best fit the observations in hm11 , and the overall mass normalisation was chosen to be the maximum that would not result in many of the assembling protoplanets crossing the gas capture threshold defined in hm11 within 1  myr .",
    "interestingly , these criteria yield almost exactly the same disk as has been recently derived by chiang & laughlin ( 2012 ) , using an analogue of the minimum mass solar nebula argument , but applied to the observed kepler candidate sample .",
    "this agreement suggests an encouraging self - consistency to our adoption of this as the underlying basis for forming a kepler sample dominated by rocky planets .",
    "our initial conditions are chosen using the formalism of kokubo & ida ( 1998 ) to assign initial masses and semi - major axes for the protoplanetary embryos at the end of the oligarchic accumulation stage , and are integrated forwards using the mercury integrator ( chambers 1999 ) on the ucla hoffman2 shared computing cluster .",
    "we perform 100  realisations of this model .",
    "the inner edge of the original disk is taken to be at 0.05  au , and so the time step for the integrations is only 12  hours , in order to resolve the innermost orbits .",
    "the integrations are run for 10  myr .",
    "this proves sufficient to achieve dynamical stability , as evidenced both by inspection of the individual evolutionary histories and the integration of a subsample of 20 to ages of 100  myr , without further significant change in the overall configuration .",
    "this assembly time scale is shorter than has been found for the solar system terrestrial planets ( e.g. chambers & wetherill 1998 ; chambers 2001 ) because of the higher mass and more compact nature of the disk .",
    "we then examine the ensemble of surviving systems to characterise various properties of the resulting population .",
    "the parameters of the final systems are shown in table  [ outtab ] , including a variety of statistical measures collected together by chambers ( 2001 ) for the purposes of characterising simulations of late stage planet assembly in the solar system .",
    "not surprisingly , the simulations here are both more closely packed ( because of the larger mass in the disks relative to the solar system case studied by chambers ) and have the mass distributed over a greater range of radii ( because we consider disks extending down to 0.05  au ) . furthermore , many of these measures are based on the distribution of mass , a quantity only indirectly accessible for the bulk of the kepler sample . as such",
    ", we will use our simulation results to build a monte carlo model to perform a more direct comparison with the observables of a kepler - style experiment .",
    "one of the most fundamental questions one can ask about the kepler data set is how many planets a given system is likely to hold .",
    "kepler has detected 361 stars ( fabrycky et al .",
    "2012 ) which exhibit multiple transiting planets , with the record for the largest number of transiting planets around a single star currently held by kepler-11 ( lissauer et al .",
    "2011a ) at six .",
    "of course , the mutual inclinations of a set of planets orbiting a star will dictate what fraction transit , and therefore the transiting planets represent only a subsample of the true underlying system .",
    "figure  [ multiplicity ] shows the distribution of true multiplicity for our simulated ensemble , in which we count all planets that survive with semi - major axes @xmath10  au , ( this excludes a handful of surviving embryos on eccentric orbits , scattered out of the original disk ) , irrespective of mass .",
    "the median number of surviving planets , so defined , is four .",
    "statistical analyses of kepler data with pre - defined functions often assume a functional form for the multiplicity that is based on the poisson distribution , ( e.g. fang & margot 2012 ) .",
    "we find that this is not a good fit to our simulations because it is too broad ( i.e. it contains too many systems with either fewer or more planets than the median value ) .",
    "furthermore , the minimum number of planets found in our simulations is three , so that our function should be adopted to describe the number in excess of two . to that end , we find that a better empirical model of the true distribution is to square the poisson function for the number of planets in excess of two , i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12 yields the best fit .    , for planets with @xmath13  au .",
    "the dotted line is a rayleigh distribution , in the scaled variable @xmath14.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ] , , for planets with @xmath13  au .",
    "the dotted line is a rayleigh distribution , in the scaled variable @xmath14.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]    the reason for the minimum multiplicity is related to the requirements of conserving mass , energy and angular momentum while assembling an extended distribution of mass into a handful of planets through mutual gravitational perturbations .",
    "we examine this issue further in   [ assemble ] .",
    "the masses of surviving planets exhibit a trend of increasing mass with semi - major axis .",
    "thus , we fit the mass distribution as a rayleigh distribution with a dispersion that depends on semi - major axis , namely @xmath15 and @xmath16 this resulting fit is shown in figure  [ mdis ] .",
    "for comparison to the kepler sample , we need to convert masses to radii . in the simplest incarnation",
    ", our model assumes that the masses of the planets are dominated by the rocky component .",
    "therefore , we use the mass - radius relation of seager et al . ( 2007 ) , based on the perovskite equation of state , to characterise our planetary radii .",
    "figure  [ mr ] shows the current sample of planets with both mass and radius measurements .",
    "it is clear that many low mass planets have radii in excess of that expected from our no - gas model , suggesting that the observed kepler planet possess atmospheres of lower molecular weight material , either water or gas .",
    "previous authors have attempted to address this issue by interpolating between rocky planets and more massive , gaseous planets .",
    "lissauer et al .",
    "( 2011b ) suggest a mass radius relation @xmath17 , based on an interpolation between the solar system terrestrial planets and ice giants .",
    "tremaine & dong ( 2012 ) , on the other hand , interpolate across the mass range probed by transiting planets .",
    "wu & lithwick ( 2012a ) find an empirical mass - radius relation @xmath18 by placing mass constraints on planetary pairs using transit - timing variations . in each case ,",
    "these relations amount to an implicit , but not well characterized , assumption about the nature of the planetary atmosphere .",
    "we adopt a radius based on the seager et al .",
    "relationship , but allow for a multiplicative radius enhancement factor @xmath19 , to account for a potential gaseous atmosphere .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for the radius of a planet with a rocky core and hydrogen atmosphere of constant mass fraction , at least in the regime ( gas mass fractions @xmath20 or less ) necessary for the known exoplanets with masses @xmath21 .",
    "a pure water planet is also well described in this way , with an enhancement factor @xmath22 .     for the planet pairs with @xmath13au .",

    "we examined a variety of statistics commonly used in assessing models of solar system formation , and found that the in situ assembly model was able to reproduce the properties of the systems observed by howard et al and mayor et al .",
    "table  [ outtab ] shows the same quantities for these simulations .",
    "one of the most common measures for planetary spacing is @xmath27 , the orbital spacing between two planets measured in terms of their average hill radius @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the semi - major axes and masses of the inner and outer planets , and @xmath31 is the mass of the host star .",
    "figure  [ del ] shows the ensemble distribution of @xmath27 in our simulations .",
    "the distribution is broad , peaking at @xmath32 .",
    "various authors have evaluated the lower limit on @xmath27 imposed by dynamical stability , with @xmath33 being the expectation for earth - mass planets on initially circular orbits ( smith & lissauer 2009 ) .",
    "our simulations do show a handful of systems just above this limit , but suggest that the more significant edge to the distribution lies at @xmath34 . at the other end , we find that @xmath35 is rare , suggesting that transiting planet pairs with larger values likely host additional , as yet undetected , planets .",
    "the statistical measures described in hm11 , and also @xmath27 , are based on knowledge of the planetary mass . for most kepler candidates , however , we have only radius measurements .",
    "thus , a more appropriate measure for the compactness of these systems is the distribution of period ratios in neighbouring pairs .",
    "lissauer et al .",
    "( 2011b ) and fabrycky et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have discussed this quantity and demonstrated that the kepler sample shows a broad distribution with additional structure near commensurabilities .",
    "figure  [ pbin ] shows the distribution from our simulations , peaking at ratios just about two .",
    "there is some hint of structure near the 2:1 commensurability , but with neither the strength or the asymmetry seen in the observational sample .",
    "lissauer et al .",

    "figure  [ zbin ] shows the distributions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 for our simulations .",
    "we see that there is some measure of avoidance of first order resonance in the simulations , and no corresponding feature with respect to second order resonance .",
    "however , we again see a symmetric structure rather than the asymmetry observed in lissauer et al or fabrycky et al . nevertheless , the broader features of the distribution are close enough that they may provide the initial basis on top of which additional dynamical structure is created by dissipative effects such as tidal evolution , as proposed by wu & lithwick ( 2012b ) or batygin & morbidelli ( 2013 ) .",
    "we can cast the same information in the direct form of a distribution of separations , which we call @xmath40 ( since it is essentially the un - normalised version of @xmath27 ) , shown in figure  [ deltaprime ] . in this case , we also want to account for a slight trend of @xmath40 with semi - major axis , fitting the distribution about this .",
    "the origin of the trend is the fact that annular spacing is dependant on the amount of mass in the disk , as discussed in   [ assemble ] .",
    "thus , we normalise @xmath40 to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and model the resulting distribution of @xmath43 as @xmath44 this is the function we will use to determine the spacing of our planetary systems .",

    "we see little indication of structure in this instance.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]      it is of interest to understand how the spacing and multiplicity of these systems is determined .",
    "the underlying process is the gravitational assembly of an extended mass distribution , regulated by both the requirements of global mass , energy and angular momentum conservation , as well as the requirement that the assembled bodies are sufficiently massive to perturb and eventually accrete any material nearby .",
    "the global conservation requirements are simple .",
    "although gravitational perturbations can potentially eject material from a planetary system , the systems we simulate are sufficiently deep in their stellar potential wells that the amount of material lost via this mechanism is negligible , and similarly for accretion onto the star .",
    "thus , for a disk with surface density @xmath48 , spread from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , the total mass , energy and angular momentum budgets are    @xmath51    if this were to be incorporated into a single final planet , of mass @xmath52 , then energy conservation dictates that the final semi - major axis is @xmath53 and angular momentum conservation requires that the eccentricity be given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "it proves impossible to satisfy these two conditions unless @xmath56 ( i.e. unless we specify an infinitely narrow ring , i.e. a single planet ) , for @xmath57 .",
    "this is because each annulus of the disk is assumed to be on a circular orbit and therefore carries the maximum angular momentum per unit energy .",
    "the energy integral is a harmonic average , which shifts the final location for the putative single planet inside the median radius of the disk , resulting in an excess of angular momentum per unit energy if one assumes all the mass is accumulated into a single planet .",
    "thus , we require at least two planets to conserve all of the mass , energy and angular momentum simultaneously in the assembly process .",
    "in addition , this assembly requires that the final planets be massive enough to gravitationally perturb and accrete all the material in the annulus into one or other of the final planets .",
    "if the original disk is not sufficiently massive , the final state may naturally consist of additional planets .",
    "we can estimate this , at least for the size of disk we simulate , by noting that our simulations suggest that @xmath58 is an upper limit to the degree of separation of final planets .",
    "if an annulus produces two planets at the inner and outer edges of the annulus , and their mutual @xmath35 , then it is likely that a third , intermediate planet forms from material that is too far from either of the other two planets to be perturbed onto a crossing orbit .",
    "we can express @xmath27 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are now running variables representing the inner edge and width of a particular annulus corresponding to the ` feeding zone ' of a particular final planet .",
    "the number 3.472 represents the quantity @xmath62 for the entire original disk from 0.05  au to 1  au , and @xmath52 represents the mass of the entire disk , normalised by a host star of mass @xmath63 .",
    "we have also assumed @xmath64 for this case .",
    "thus , as an example , assuming that one planet forms at the inner edge of the disk at 0.05  au , the requirement that @xmath65 suggests @xmath66 under these conditions , so that the second planet lies no further than @xmath67  au . using this location",
    "as the inner edge of the next annulus suggests @xmath68 and a third planet at 0.24  au .",
    "similarly , this indicates @xmath69 and a fourth planet at 0.85  au , which is close to the outer edge of our disk .",
    "thus , we expect at least four planets to form from our original disk and the simulations do indeed produce mostly four and five planet systems . if we repeat this exercise with @xmath32 ( closer to the median of the distribution ) , the values of y range from 1.52 , and one can fit 6 planets between 0.05  au and 1  au , and 7 if the outer edge is 1.2  au .",
    "thus , stability considerations suggest that most systems should have between 4 and 7 planets , as is indeed observed .",
    "note that the range of y encompassed by these arguments does allow for the presence of 2:1 period ratios .",
    "even ratios in the 3:2 range are dynamically allowed , although they require @xmath27 values between the median and the stability limit .",
    "one can convert the quantity y into a period ratio for each planet pair .",
    "figure  [ kepdel ] shows the distribution of period ratios as a function of inner planet period for all planets in multiple systems that fall within our sample cuts in   [ obs ] .",
    "also shown are lines of constant @xmath27 using equation  ( [ deltaeq ] ) .",
    "this is another way of representing the distribution shown in figure  [ del ] , and we find that indeed the bulk of the planets cluster in the range @xmath70 and that the limits at 10 and 50 are good delimiters of the edge of the distribution .",

    "figure  [ kepdel ] also shows coloured chains for a handful of confirmed , high multiplicity kepler systems .",
    "we see that the outer pair of the kepler-20 system ( blue ) has a period ratio that puts it in the high @xmath27 wing of the distribution , suggesting that an additional planet may be waiting to be found between kepler-20f and kepler-20d .",
    "although the period spacing between kepler-11f and kepler-11 g deviates somewhat from that of the inner planets in the system , it is still well within the expected distribution , so that we do not necessarily have a strong motivation to expect an additional planet in that gap .",

    "we see that the tail of large eccentricities is somewhat larger than expected for a rayleigh distribution ( the normal assumption for the functional form ) .",

    "we draw planetary separations from the distribution function @xmath87 and planetary masses from @xmath88 ( out to distances of 1  au ) .",
    "we then evaluate the value of @xmath27 for each pair and reject any systems containing a pair that violates @xmath89 or @xmath26 ( this is a small minority of cases because the distribution of @xmath90 is closely related to @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",

    "these prior studies suggest that the kepler database is relatively complete for @xmath95 and @xmath96  days , and so we adopt this as our conservative observational limit criteria .",
    "in order to compare our monte carlo model to the observations , we adopt the following criteria ( following howard et al . 2012 and youdin 2011 ) to define a complete subsample of the publicly released kepler planet candidate catalog as of jan 2013 ( although we also compare to the sample announced in batalha et al .",

    "( 2011b ) noted the potential excess of singles and argued that simple geometric considerations suggest that the ratio of singles to doubles should be higher unless there is an unusual correlation or inclination dispersion . to that end , we paid special attention to modelling the high inclination portion of the distributions in figure  [ ibin ] and to potential correlations in the lines of nodes , but neither of these appears to have materially affected the results .",
    "although other studies such as tremaine & dong ( 2012 ) and fang & margot ( 2012 ) claim consistency in their modelling of all the data , this is because their chosen statistical distributions allow for a substantial population of single transiting systems , something not allowed by our more physically derived model .    we can , of course , simply postulate a second unknown process at work that produces only single tranet systems , which can then be combined with our model .",
    "if we postulate that this second process operates at the same rate as our model , we predict a ratio of singles to doubles @xmath104 , which matches the observations .",

    "indeed , reasonable agreement can be obtained by only circularising orbits within a certain upper semi - major cutoff .",
    "the solid histogram shows the @xmath108 distribution for the case in which this limit is 0.20  au , which defines the @xmath111 level with respect to the fit obtained with full circularisation .",
    "we note that the improvement in the fit is solely due to the reduction in the eccentricity  we do not assume any change in the mutual inclinations as a result of tidal effects .",
    "the comparison of the model period ratio distribution to observations , shown in figure  [ prat ] , is not quite as good as the various measures that depend on inclinations",
    ". some of the structure is reproduced , but the simulations underpredict the number of close pairs relative to the number of more widely separated pairs .",
    "furthermore , although there is a double peaked structure to the distribution between period ratios of 13 , the peaks are shifted to larger values than observed .",
    "indeed , the entire shape of the distribution appears shifted by @xmath112% to larger values .",
    "this suggests that some level of dissipation is required beyond the simple assembly model assumed here .",
    "it has been suggested that such enhancements near commensurabilities , and the slight shift in the observed values , could be the result of tidal evolution ( wu & lithwick 2012b ; batygin & morbidelli 2013 ) .",

    "steffen ( 2013 ) has noted that the period ratio distribution is subtly different between high multiplicity ( four or more tranet candidates ) and low multiplicity ( two tranet candidates ) systems . in figure  [ prat2 ]",
    "we show the corresponding comparison between the same data as in figure  [ prat ] but now with two distributions drawn from the model in the same spirit as steffen ( 2013 ) .",
    "we see that the high multiplicity model systems actually do a much better job of reproducing the data than the lower multiplicity systems .",
    "the mismatch in figure  [ prat ] is clearly the result of the stronger weighting towards the two tranet systems as in figure  [ multistats ] , but the structure here suggests that selection effects that favour more high multiplicity systems could potentially improve the comparison as much as moderate radial migration .",
    "we note also that the distribution from the two - tranet systems is indeed shifted slightly compared to the higher multiplicity systems , as suggested by the comparison by steffen .",
    "we can also compare our simulations to the distribution of absolute periods of detected tranets .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ pdis ] .",
    "we see that the shape of the distribution is well reproduced for @xmath11310  days , but that the simple model overproduces short period tranets by a factor of three near the peak of the distribution .",
    "this is likely a consequence of our rather naive application of a single model realisation to the full population , in the sense that our planetary embryo disks all have an inner edge at 0.05  au and therefore almost always produce a planet with an orbital period @xmath114  days .",
    "if the true underlying model for the planetary initial conditions contains some variation in the location of the inner edge , then this peak will be reduced .",
    "we have kept our default model simple in order to highlight the robustness of the match to the data , but we can also demonstrate that a more comprehensive match to the data is achievable with minor modifications to the model .",
    "one mismatch observed in the previous subsection is the overproduction of tranets with orbital periods @xmath114  days .",
    "this is due in large part to the assumption that all protoplanetary disk have the same inner edge . to demonstrate this",
    ", we consider a modification to our monte carlo model in which we adopt an inner edge to the original disk of 0.08  au , in 55% of cases . in the other 45% of cases , we adopt the original model .",
    "we use the same mass , orbital spacing , eccentricity and inclination distributions as before . in effect , we simply remove those planets that lie inside 0.08  au in 55% of the cases .",
    "we show the results of this model in figure  [ pdis ] .",
    "this modification does not change the quality of the fits to the @xmath108 distribution or the period ratio distribution .",
    "similarly , we have not attempted to directly match the observed distribution of radii , because of the distinct possibility that there may be significant stochastic variation in the mass of hydrogen accreted / retained by planets .",
    "nevertheless , one can match the observed radius distribution with a suitable choice of mass - radius relation .",
    "figure  [ rbin ] shows the observed distribution of tranetary radii for the sample identified in ",
    "[ obs ] , compared to two distributions derived from our monte carlo model .",
    "the dotted histogram shows the results for @xmath102 , which captures the median value of the population but does not match the shape .",
    "the solid histogram shows the result from the same model except that we now adopt @xmath115 .",
    "this provides a good fit to the tail of the distribution at larger radii , and still matches the other observational constraints .",
    "this relation bears some resemblance to both the interpolation of l11 and the linear fit of wu & lithwick ( 2012a ) , although the nature of the fit means it is weighted more by lower mass objects than the higher masses as in the case of wu & lithwick . the effective physical model described by",
    "this relation is one in which planets have hydrogen mass fractions @xmath116 for masses @xmath117 , increasing gradually to roughly 50% at masses @xmath118 .",
    "our study follows on the heels of several previous analyses of the kepler multiple tranet candidate systems ( lissauer et al . 2011b ; fabrycky et al . 2012 ) .",
    "all of these studies agree that the underlying planetary configuration is best modelled by a population that has an inclination dispersion of only a few degrees , and that this is also consistent with the radial velocity sample ( lissauer et al . 2011b ; fabrycky et al .",
    "2012 ; figueira et al .",
    "2011 ; tremaine & dong 2012 ; fang & margot 2012 ) .",
    "our analysis affirms these conclusions with the additional benefit of being drawn directly from a physical model , rather than a set of ad hoc postulates .",
    "our inability to match the single tranet numbers is also foreshadowed either directly ( l11 ) or by best fit models that require a large fraction of low multiplicity systems ( tremaine & dong 2012 ; fang & margot 2012 ) .    the fact that our underlying model always produces three or more final planets brings this issue into stark contrast .",
    "the most convenient explanation is that that the rate of false positives is higher amongst the single tranet sample than the multiples , but this would require that current estimates of the false positive rate are severely in error .",
    "lissauer et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have argued that the rate of false positives amongst the multiple systems is very low , but this necessarily excludes the single candidate systems .",
    "santerne et al .",
    "( 2012 ) has claimed that the false positive rate for jupiter - size candidates is higher ( @xmath119 ) than originally estimated ( morton & johnson 2011 ) , but it is not clear that the same false positive rate will apply to systems with smaller eclipses .",
    "detailed simulations of the kepler detection process suggests a false positive rate in the range 7%-16% for the size of planets in our sample ( fressin et al .",
    "thus , it seems that we require either an entirely separate contribution of single tranet systems or a process that modifies or edits some fraction of the systems that assemble according to our model .    .",
    "it reproduces the average value of the observed distribution but clearly undercounts both the low and high radius tails .",

    "the solid histogram shows the result if we use the mass dependant radius correction @xmath120 , which does a better job of reproducing the observed shape.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]    although we have neglected any effects due to large - scale , post - assembly planetary migration in this calculation , it could potentially be the alternative contributing process we seek , especially if the late - time instability of resonant chains ( terquem & papaloizou 2007 ; ida & lin 2010 ) produces primarily systems of low multiplicity .",
    "however , in that event , it is surprising that both processes produce essentially the same orbital period distribution .",
    "figure  [ pcomp ] shows the cumulative distribution for tranets ( @xmath121 ) in single transit systems ( open circles ) and multiple transit systems ( filled circles ) . there is little evidence of any difference between the two populations that might indicate a different origin scenario for @xmath122 of the single systems .",
    "furthermore , there is also little evidence of any relative incompleteness based on host star magnitude .",
    "figure  [ ratk ] shows the ratio of double to single tranet systems as a function of the kepler magnitude of the host stars .",
    "we see that the ratio remains essentially constant from kepler magnitudes 1216 , well beyond our nominal completeness limit .    .",
    "error bars are dictated by poisson errors on the double tranet systems .",
    "the vertical dashed line is the limit we use to define our sample in",
    "  [ obs ] , and the shaded region shows the range of values we expect , based on our simulations . if some double tranet systems were being identified as only single tranet systems because of low signal - to - noise , we would expect this ratio to decrease.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ] , .",

    "if some double tranet systems were being identified as only single tranet systems because of low signal - to - noise , we would expect this ratio to decrease.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]    alternatively , this could simply indicate that our model is incomplete in the sense that the systems are assembled as we describe , but are then subjected to further dynamical influences that remove some planets from the system and reduce the multiplicity .",
    "indeed , we have simulated systems of terrestrial class planets only , without consideration of the interaction with potential gas giant planets in the same system , despite the fact that we know such planets exist in our own solar system and others .",
    "it is well known that even limited migration by giant planets during the loss of the protoplanetary nebula can cause the frequencies of secular interactions to evolve , potentially resulting in resonant interactions , eccentricity excitation and eventual instability in lower mass planetary components ( ward 1981 ; nagasawa , lin & ida 2003 ; levison & agnor 2003 ; thommes , nagasawa & lin 2008 ) .",
    "alternatively , giant planet secular evolution by gravitational interactions alone may be enough to stimulate dynamical evolution of lower mass systems ( e.g. veras & armitage 2003 ; laskar 2008 ; lithwick & wu 2011 ; matsumura , ida & nagasawa 2012 ) thus , it is possible that some of this dichotomy may simply reflect the role of a more distant component of giant planets in some systems but not in others .",
    "we have demonstrated that a simple in situ assembly model can reproduce the broad distributions of tranetary periods and inclinations observed in the kepler database",
    ". however , this model seems to underpredict the frequency of close pairs ( i.e. pairs with period ratios @xmath123 ) nor does it completely reproduce the observed structure near the 3:2 and 2:1 commensurabilities .",
    "these suggest that , while the broad organisation of the observed planetary systems appears to be consistent with a primarily gravitational process , matching the fine structure will likely require a model that includes some means of additional dissipation .",
    "part of this may be provided by tidal dissipation in the planets .",
    "we have already demonstrated that the fit to the @xmath108 distribution can be improved if we allow for the circularisation of orbits inside @xmath124au ( corresponding to @xmath7950 , depending on planetary mass and radius ) .",
    "this process is promising in that it can reduce the eccentricity while preserving the inclination distribution of the planetary orbits , which seems to fit the observations well .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that there is so little need for migration in fitting these observations .",
    "the rapid movement of planetary mass objects in a gas disk has been a topic of great interest for the last several years .",
    "the strength of this interaction was expected to result in very few planets of the observed mass range at the orbital periods observed , ( e.g. ida & lin 2008 ) .",
    "one way to slow the rate of migration is for strong gravitational interactions between planets to counteract the transfer of angular momentum from orbit to gaseous disk , but this is expected to lead to systems with a large fraction of the systems in or close to resonance ( terquem & papaloizou 2007 ; ida & lin 2010 ) .",
    "although some resonant systems are seen , it appears as though a migration model requires a significant additional stochastic forcing to match the observed period distribution ( rein 2012 ) .",
    "it is possible that this mismatch simply reflects the limitations of current models for how planets interact with the gaseous disk , as the effects of migration depend critically on the interaction between the planetary forcing and the structure of the disk ( e.g. terquem 2003 ; laughlin , steinacker & adams 2004 ; johnson , goodman & menou 2006 ; paardekooper & mellema 2006 ; paardekooper et al .",
    "2010 ; bromley & kenyon 2011 ; hasegawa & pudritz 2011 ; kretke & lin 2012 ) .",
    "this is because the speed and even direction of migration depends on the imperfect cancellation between the torques exerted by the disk interior and exterior to the planet .",
    "one possibility , suggested by several authors ( e.g. masset et al .",
    "2006 ) , is that the torque may reverse sign at particular locations in the disk , leading to ` planet traps '  preferred locations where planets assemble .",
    "it is possible that our power law surface density profile may simply represent an averaged version of a disk with several such preferred locations , and that some disks may have more localised distributions which could contribute to the overabundance of low multiplicity systems .",
    "indeed , this might help to place our solar system in the kepler context , as our own terrestrial planet system is potentially the outcome of a disk with a single localised planet trap ( hansen 2009 ) .",
    "the primary goal of this study is to demonstrate that a simple model of in situ assembly of rocky planets can reproduce the distribution of observed parameters in the kepler multiple tranet sample .",
    "however , given that consistency , it is useful to attempt to outline additional analyses or observations that can further refine the comparison .",
    "some of the consequences are rather obvious .",
    "the fact that neighbouring tranets with large period ratios can harbour additional unseen planets has been noted before ( e.g. l11 ) , but we can provide a prediction of the quantitative threshold for such predictions .",
    "we have seen that our simulations rarely produce neighbouring systems with @xmath26 , suggesting that multiple systems with larger values should harbor planets in these apparent gaps .",
    "our model suggests planetary systems are factors of 23 less densely packed than a ` maximally packed ' system just on the edge of stability , so that the threshold of @xmath58 should mark a change in the frequency of non - transiting companions .",
    "indeed , figure  [ ddis ] shows that the distribution of @xmath27 that emerges from the simulations shows a qualitative break at @xmath58 .",
    "the high @xmath27 tail of this distribution is thus the group that should contain non - transiting interlopers .",
    "we can compare this to the observed distribution of @xmath27 in the observed sample . in this case",
    "we use the catalog of batalha et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in order to use later additions to the catalog to assess any predictive power our model comparison may uncover .",
    "a comparison with the data also requires the adoption of a mass - radius relation . using the mass - radius relation used by l11 and f12 , to maintain consistency with previous analyses , we define our observed @xmath27 as @xmath125 .",
    "the resulting observed distribution shows a very similar feature , but the break occurs at @xmath126 .",
    "the similarity in shape between the two distributions suggests a measure of renormalisation is in order , and that the values of @xmath125 used in l11 and f12 are likely underestimated by @xmath127% , or that the l11 mass - radius relation overestimates the planetary mass , at least in the lower mass regime .",
    "table  [ deltatab ] lists the observed pairs that have @xmath128 in figure  [ ddis ] .",
    "if we estimate masses from orbital periods for the entries in this table with @xmath129 , using equation  ( [ mtrend ] ) , we find a range @xmath130 for 11 systems , with a median of @xmath131 .",
    "thus , it suggests that the renormalisation from @xmath132 to @xmath133 is consistent with the difference in the adopted models for the planetary masses .",
    "as can be seen from the notes to table  [ deltatab ] , there are several systems in which we have strong evidence for the presence of planets in the ostensible gaps .",
    "the systems plotted in figure  [ ddis ] were selected for consistency with our model comparison , namely we restricted our attention to planets with radii @xmath134 . in two of the cases , additional tranets ( koi  70.05 and koi  117.04 ) were already known but not included in the above comparison because their radii fell below the radius cutoff .",
    "the addition of further data beyond the first six quarters has also resulted in the detection of tranets in the gaps in three other ( koi-116 , koi-593 and koi-671 ) systems . in three systems ( koi-316 , koi-341 and koi-582 )",
    "additional observations have cast doubt on either the validity of one of the candidates themselves , or on one of the periods ( which would therefore change the @xmath125 ) .",
    "in addition to directly observing a transit by an additional planet candidate , it is possible to identify the presence of non - transiting companions by observing variations in the timing of transits by known tranets , due to the gravitational perturbation of the unseen companion ( agol et al .",
    "2005 ; holman & murray 2005 ; veras , ford & payne 2011 ) .",
    "ford et al . (",
    "2012 ) identified 1436 systems with potential transit timing variations ( ttvs ) .",
    "if we restrict our attention to systems with two candidate tranets , with the same stellar , planetary and magnitude cuts as before , we are left with 11 potential systems with median deviations from a linear ephemeris that are larger than the quoted dispersions representing transit timing accuracy .",
    "figure  [ ttv ] shows the cumulative distribution of these 11 systems as a function of @xmath125 , along with the same distribution for the full sample of observed double candidate systems ( subject to the same cuts ) .",
    "we see that the systems with potential ttvs are indeed skewed to larger @xmath125 , and that the maximum deviation occurs at @xmath126 , as expected .",
    "the small number of candidate systems means that this result is still statistically weak ( a kolmogorov - smirnov test suggests that the ttv - selected distribution could be drawn from the larger sample with a probability of 7% ) , but this should hopefully improve with longer baselines of observation .",
    "furthermore , steffen et al . (",
    "2012 ) identify candidate pairs which may show anticorrelated ttv signatures , and many of the pairs in table  [ deltatab ] are identified as worthy of further study .",
    "a better comparison may be possible soon as mazeh et al .",
    "( 2013 ) promise an improved catalog will be shortly forthcoming , based on a longer baseline of data .     of the 11 candidate pair systems which pass our stellar and planetary cuts and show ttvs of more than @xmath135 statistical significance .",
    "the dotted histogram shows the same but for the full sample of tranet pairs , selected in the same way except without taking account of ttv signatures.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ] , of the 11 candidate pair systems which pass our stellar and planetary cuts and show ttvs of more than @xmath135 statistical significance .",
    "the dotted histogram shows the same but for the full sample of tranet pairs , selected in the same way except without taking account of ttv signatures.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ]    it is also worth noting that a first prediction of this model , based on multiplicity statistics , was made in hm11 . in that case",
    ", three multiple planet systems were identified in which the detection of additional planets would improve the match with the models .",
    "the recent announcement of additional planets in one of these systems , hd40307 ( tuomi et al .",
    "2012 ) , does indeed improve the agreement with the original models .",
    "although this is hardly a revolutionary prediction ( a linear trend in the radial velocity data was already known at the time of writing ) , it is still encouraging that additional detections improve the agreement between the model and the data .    if the overabundance of single tranet systems is indeed the result of a systemic instability induced by the presence of a giant planet system at larger radii , then it would of interest to study two samples ( one set of multiple candidate systems and another of single candidates of similar radius ) of kepler systems with radial velocities , in order to characterise whether there are any significant differences which may betray divergent dynamical histories .",
    "one possible signature would be if the single short - period candidate systems showed two or more giant planets , while multiple short - period candidate systems showed only zero or one giant planet .",
    "such a difference might point the way to secular evolution and resonance playing a role in the disruption of inner planetary systems .",
    "improved eccentricity constraints would also enable better constraints on the model . as showed above , the fit to the @xmath108 distribution ( figure  [ xiplot ] ) got better for larger @xmath136 ( i.e. stronger tidal damping in the planets ) .",
    "the current constraints on the eccentricities due to transit durations ( moorhead et al .",
    "2011 ) find little evidence for circularisation .",
    "however , their contraint is weakened by uncertainty in the stellar parameters and strictly only applies for cooler stars than our nominal host .",
    "wu & lithwick ( 2012a ) find that a significant fraction of their systems with strong ttvs show very small free eccentricities , consistent with a level of tidal dissipation similar to what we have assumed here ( although there appears to be a minority of systems with significant eccentricities , which are harder to explain ) .",
    "we have studied the assembly of planetary embryos into final planets for a disk of total mass @xmath1 ( interior to 1 au ) around a solar mass star .",
    "we quantify the distribution of final masses , eccentricities and inclinations , as well as the spacings of the final planets , and use these to generate a large population of simulated systems in a monte carlo model .",
    "the output from these simulations is used to quantify their detectability in a transit survey such as that conducted by the kepler mission .",
    "* the relative frequency of multiple transiting systems is well matched by the simulations .",
    "however , our model underpredicts the frequency of single tranet systems .",
    "if this is not due to unquantified selection effects , then it suggests that either an independent process produces mostly low multiplicity systems , or that some fraction of the planetary systems formed by our model undergo additional perturbations which reduce their multiplicity . + * the distribution of mutual inclinations , quantified by the velocity - normalised transit duration ratio @xmath108 ( f12 ) , is well matched by the simulations , especially if we allow for tidal damping of eccentricity for short period orbits .",
    "this is encouraging as it provides a physical basis for the observed inclination distribution of the kepler tranet candidate sample . + * our default model matches the distribution of periods well for periods @xmath137  days , but overpredicts the number of short period tranets .",
    "this deficit can be corrected by allowing for a variation in the inner edge of the initial disk , as demonstrated in   [ edge ] . + * our model underpredicts the number of close tranet pairs .",
    "this is the one observable that suggests that some extra ( non - tidal ) dissipation is required during the planetary assembly . at present",
    "there appear to be at least two possible ways to achieve this .",
    "one would be to cause a moderate amount of radial migration to bring pairs into closer alignment .",
    "alternatively , it appears as though the observed period ratio distribution would be matched better if the relative fraction of high multiplicity to low multiplicity systems were increased in the monte carlo model .",
    "this could potentially be achieved with a moderate amount of inclination damping by interactions with a protoplanetary gas disk . however , too much damping would destroy the agreement with the @xmath108 distribution , so it might be possible to place some interesting constraints on the conditions during planet assembly . + * we suggest that most observed tranet pairs with @xmath138 contain additional non - transiting planets between them , and we find weak statistical evidence ( limited by currently small sample sizes ) that pairs with non - negligible ttv signatures are preferentially found with values above this threshold .",
    "larger and improved data sets can help to refine this test of the model .",
    "our assumption of a universal power law disk of fixed mass , which assembles by purely gravitational interactions , is clearly an oversimplification of what is expected to be a very complex physical problem .",
    "however , the broad distributions of inclination , multiplicity and planetary spacing match well to both observations directly and to prior inferences based on ad hoc models .",
    "the fact that our model has a physical basis places some of the issues into starker contrast .",
    "in particular , the observed excess of single ( or low multiplicity ) tranetary systems suggests that additional processes are needed to provide a complete model .",
    "the fact that a purely gravitational process produces a final distribution that matches the observations places constraints on the amount of dissipation expected from interactions with the protoplanetary disk .",
    "some level of dissipation is required to match the period ratio distribution , but it needs to be weak enough to destroy neither the broad spacing in semi - major axis nor the inclination distribution .    finally , our ability to fruitfully perform such analyses illustrates the value of large scale , homogeneously selected observational datasets .",
    "the requirement that our models match a broad range of observed systems promises to finally allow us to begin to place meaningful constraints on the mechanisms by which planetary systems form and assemble .",
    "is supported in part by nserc of canada and by the canada research chair program .",
    "thanks the group at nasa ames for discussions that stimulated the discussion in   [ assemble ] and both express their enthusiasm for the work done by the kepler team in producing this wonderful data set .",

    "<S> we present a monte carlo model for the structure of low mass ( total mass @xmath0 ) planetary systems that form by the in situ gravitational assembly of planetary embryos into final planets . </S>",
    "<S> our model includes distributions of mass , eccentricity , inclination and period spacing that are based on the simulation of a disk of @xmath1 , forming planets around a solar mass star , and assuming a power law surface density distribution @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the output of the monte carlo model is then subjected to the selection effects that mimic the observations of a transiting planet search such as that performed by the kepler satellite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting comparison of the output to the properties of the observed sample yields an encouraging agreement in terms of the relative frequencies of multiple planet systems and the distribution of the mutual inclinations , when moderate tidal circularisation is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the broad features of the period distribution and radius distribution can also be matched within this framework , although the model underpredicts the distribution of small period ratios . </S>",
    "<S> this likely indicates that some dissipation is still required in the formation process .    </S>",
    "<S> the most striking deviation between model and observations is in the ratio of single to multiple systems , in that there are roughly 50% more single planet candidates observed than are produced in any model population . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that some systems must suffer additional attrition to reduce the number of planets or increase the range of inclinations . </S>"
