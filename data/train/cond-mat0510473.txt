    "in a series of recent papers@xcite , we have presented a comprehensive theoretical study of gas adsorption / desorption in silica aerogels , revealing the microscopic mechanisms that underly the changes in the morphology of the hysteresis loops with temperature and gel porosity . in particular , we have shown that the traditional capillary condensation scenario based on the independent - pore model@xcite does not apply to aerogels , as a consequence of the  open \" nature and interconnectedness of their microstructure .",
    "we have found , on the other hand , that nonequilibrium phase transitions ( that differ on adsorption and desorption ) are at the origin of the very steep isotherms observed with @xmath0he in high porosity gels at low temperature@xcite . in this work",
    ", we complete our study by investigating the correlations within the adsorbed fluid and computing the fluid - fluid and solid - fluid structure factors that can be measured ( at least indirectly ) in scattering experiments .",
    "scattering methods ( using x - rays , neutrons and visible light ) are now frequently combined with thermodynamic measurements for extracting information on the structure and the dynamics of the adsorbed molecules and understanding the influence of solid microstructure on fluid properties@xcite . in the case of @xmath0he in aerogel ,",
    "both small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs)@xcite and light scattering measurements@xcite have been recently performed along the sorption isotherms . however , the interpretation of the scattered intensity is always complicated by the fact that it contains several contributions that can not be resolved without assuming some mechanism for the sorption process . for instance , in the case of a low porosity solid like vycor , the evolution of the scattered intensity along the capillary rise is usually interpreted in the framework of an independent - pore model , with the gas condensing in pores of increasing size that are ( almost ) randomly distributed throughout the material@xcite .",
    "this explains that long - range correlations are not observed during adsorption . on the other hand",
    ", we have shown that large - scale collective events occur in aerogels , and this may have a significant influence on the scattering properties .",
    "indeed , we shall see in the following that scattering curves at low temperature may not reflect the underlying microstructure of the gel .",
    "more generally , our main objective is to understand how the different mechanisms for adsorption and desorption reflect in the scattering properties as the temperature is changed .",
    "( note that there has been a recent theoretical study of this problem that is closely related to the present one@xcite ; there are , however , significant differences that will be commented in due place . ) particular attention will be paid to the ` percolation invasion ' regime that is predicted to occur during the draining of gels of medium porosity ( e.g. @xmath1 ) and that manifests itself by the presence of fractal correlations .",
    "such correlations have been observed in vycor@xcite and xerogel@xcite , but no experiment has been carried out so far to detect a similar phenomenon in aerogels .",
    "we therefore hope that the present work will be an incentive for such a study . on the other hand",
    ", the influence of gel porosity on scattering properties will only be evoked very briefly .",
    "in particular , for reasons that will be explained below , the correlations along the steep ( and possibly discontinuous due to nonequilibrium phase transitions ) isotherms observed in high porosity gels at low temperature are not investigated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the model and the theory are briefly reviewed and the cart.texomputation of the correlation functions and the corresponding structure factors is detailed .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section 3 .",
    "the relevance of our results to existing and future scattering experiments is discussed in section 4 .",
    "as discussed in previous papers@xcite , our approach is based on a coarse - grained lattice - gas description which incorporates the essential physical ingredients of gel - fluid systems .",
    "the model hamiltonian is given by @xmath2-\\mu \\sum_i \\tau_i\\eta_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the fluid occupation variable ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 is the quenched random variable that describes the solid microstructure ( when @xmath6 , site @xmath7 is occupied by the gel ; @xmath8 is thus the gel porosity ) .",
    "specifically , we adress the case of base - catalyzed silica aerogels ( typically used in helium experiments ) whose structure is well accounted for by a diffusion limited cluster - cluster aggregation algorithm ( dlca)@xcite . in the hamiltonian , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote respectively the fluid - fluid and gel - fluid attractive interactions , @xmath11 is the fluid chemical potential ( fixed by an external reservoir ) , and the double summations run over all distinct pairs of nearest - neighbor ( n.n . ) sites .",
    "fluid configurations along the sorption isotherms are computed using local mean - field theory ( i.e. mean - field density functional theory ) , neglecting thermal fluctuations and activated processes ( the interested reader is referred to refs.@xcite for a detailed presentation of the theory ) .",
    "as @xmath12 varies , the system visits a sequence of metastable states which are local minima of the following grand - potential functional @xmath13 -w_{ff } \\sum_{<ij>}\\rho_i\\rho_j   -w_{gf}\\sum_{<ij>}[\\rho_i(1-\\eta_j)+\\rho_j(1-\\eta_i ) ] -\\mu\\sum_i\\rho_i\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the thermally averaged fluid density at site @xmath7 .",
    "earlier work has shown that this approach reproduces qualitatively the main features of adsorption phenomena in disordered porous solids@xcite .",
    "all calculations presented below were performed on a body - centered cubic lattice of linear size @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) with periodic boundary conditions in all directions ( the lattice spacing @xmath17 is taken as the unit length ) .",
    "@xmath18 is large enough to faithfully describe gels with porosity @xmath19 , but an average over a significant number of gel realizations is required to obtain a good description of the correlation functions . in the following , we use @xmath20 realizations .",
    "@xmath9 is taken as the energy unit and temperatures are expressed in the reduced unit @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the critical temperature of the pure fluid ( @xmath23 for helium and @xmath24 in the theory ) .",
    "the interaction ratio @xmath25 is equal to @xmath26 so as to reproduce approximately the height of the hysteresis loop measured with @xmath0he in a @xmath1 porosity aerogel at @xmath27@xcite .      in a scattering experiment performed in conjunction with gas adsorption / desorption ,",
    "one typically measures a ( spherically averaged ) scattered intensity @xmath28 which is proportional to a combination of the three partial structure factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the gel and the fluid , respectively .",
    "whereas a macroscopic sample is usually considered as isotropic and statistically homogeneous , our calculations are performed in finite samples and on a lattice , and some work is needed to obtain structure factors that can be possibly compared to experimental data .",
    "let us first consider the gel structure factor .",
    "the calculation of @xmath33 proceeds in several steps . as in the case of an off - lattice dlca simulation@xcite , we first compute the two - point correlation function @xmath34 by performing a double average over the lattice sites and the gel realizations , @xmath35 taking care of the periodic boundary conditions . here ,",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 is the lattice fraction occupied by the gel , and the second term in the right - hand side takes into account the fact that there are only one particle per site , which yields the ( point ) hard - core condition , @xmath38 . in this expression and in the following",
    ", the overbar denotes an average over different gel realizations produced by the dlca algorithm .",
    "the computation of @xmath39 is efficiently performed by introducing the fourier transform @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a vector of the reciprocal lattice , and by using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) method@xcite .",
    "this reduces the computational work to @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 when the direct real - space route is used .",
    "( the same method is applied to the other correlation functions . )    in a second step , we  sphericalize \" the correlation function by collecting the values having same modulus of the argument @xmath44 , @xmath45 finally , instead of storing the values of @xmath46 for all possible distances @xmath47 on the lattice between @xmath48 , the nearest - neighbor distance , and @xmath49 , we bin the data with a spacing @xmath50 and interpolate linearly between two successive points ( the restriction to @xmath51 avoids boundary artefacts ) . moreover , we impose the  extended \" hard - core condition @xmath52 for @xmath53 , in line with our interpretation of a gel site as representing an impenetrable silica particle@xcite .",

    "of course , the interpolation procedure does not completely erase the dependence on the underlying lattice structure , especially at short distances .",
    "following ref.@xcite , the structure factor is then computed using @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a very small parameter adjusted such that @xmath57 as @xmath58 . indeed , since the dlca aerogels are built in the",

    "this trick allows one to obtain a reasonable continuation of @xmath33 below @xmath62@xcite .",
    "similarly , the fluid - fluid two - point correlation function @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the average fluid density and the sum is performed again over all lattice sites to improve the statistics ( for notational simplicity , we have dropped the overbar on @xmath66 ) . because of the double average over thermal fluctuations and over disorder , there are two distinct contributions to @xmath67 , which are usually called  connected \" and  blocking \" or  disconnected \" @xcite , and which , in the present case , are given by the expressions , @xmath68 } \\",

    "it turns out , however , that only @xmath70 can be computed along the sorption isotherms .",
    "indeed , the quantity @xmath71 can not be obtained in the framework of mean - field theory , and the only available route to @xmath69 is via the  fluctuation \" relation@xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a site - dependent chemical potential@xcite .",
    "however , this relation only holds at equilibrium ( like the gibbs adsorption equation @xmath74 discussed in ref.@xcite ) and therefore it can not be applied along the hysteresis loop where the system jumps from one metastable state to another .",
    "( in a finite sample , the grand potential changes discontinuously along the adsorption and desorption desorption branches@xcite . )",
    "we are thus forced to approximate @xmath67 by its disconnected part , @xmath70@xcite .",
    "however , this may not be a bad approximation at low temperature because the local fluid densities @xmath75 are then very close to zero or one@xcite , which likely implies that @xmath69 is a much smaller quantity than @xmath70@xcite .",
    "we then apply to @xmath67 the same procedure as for @xmath39 , taking radial averages and then performing a binning of the data and a linear interpolation .",
    "there are no  extended \" hard - core in this case . indeed , since the scale of the coarse - graining is fixed by the size of a gel particle ( typically , a few nanometers ) , a lattice cell may contain several hundreds of fluid molecules which may be thus considered as point particles .",
    "@xmath76 is then also interpolated between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    in a grand - canonical calculation",
    ", the number of fluid particles fluctuates from sample to sample , which implies the following sum - rule for the disconnected pair correlation function @xmath70@xcite ( and thus for @xmath67 in our approximation ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the average fluid density for a given gel realization .",

    "the gel - fluid two - point correlation function @xmath86 is computed from @xmath87 and then sphericalized , binned , and linearly interpolated ( taking @xmath88 for @xmath89 since no fluid molecule can be found at a distance less than @xmath90 from the centre of a gel particle ) .",
    "the cross structure factor @xmath30 is then obtained from @xmath91 where @xmath92 is adjusted so as to satisfy the sum - rule @xmath93 which again results from the absence of fluctuations in the number of gel particles .",
    "we first concentrate on the case of the empty aerogel .",
    "we have already presented in ref.@xcite the pair correlation function @xmath46 for several porosities between @xmath1 and @xmath94 .",
    "these curves exhibit a shallow minimum that strongly depends on @xmath95 and whose position gives an estimate of the gel correlation lenght @xmath96 , as suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "a dlca gel can indeed be sketched as a disordered packing of ramified blobs with average size @xmath96 .",
    "for instance , @xmath96 varies approximately from @xmath97 to @xmath54 lattice spacings as the porosity increases from @xmath1 to @xmath98 ( this is much smaller than the box size @xmath18 , which ensures that there are no finite - size artifacts in the calculation of the gel structure@xcite ) .",
    "only the highest - porosity samples exhibit a significant power - law regime @xmath99 that reveals the fractal character of the intrablob correlations .     obtained with the dlca algorithm for different porosities . from left to right : @xmath100 .",

    "1 the evolution of the simulated gel structure factor with porosity .    the curves closely resemble those obtained with the continuum model@xcite . in particular",
    ", they exhibit the same damped oscillations at large @xmath103 that result from the  extended \" hard - core condition @xmath52 for @xmath53 ( the oscillations , however , are more significant in the continuum model ) .",
    "the range of the linear fractal regime increases with porosity ( it is almost non - existent in the @xmath1 gel ) and corresponds asymptotically to a fractal dimension @xmath104 ( the value @xmath105 was obtained in ref.@xcite from the @xmath46 plot for the @xmath94 aerogel ) .",
    "a characteristic feature of the curves is the existence of a maximum at smaller wavevectors whose location @xmath106 decreases with porosity and correlates well with @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "this maximum is thus the fourier - space signature of the shallow minimum observed in @xmath46 .",
    "( note that varying the size @xmath18 has only a weak influence on the small @xmath103 portion of the curves for the @xmath1 and @xmath109 gels , which validates the continuation procedure used in eq .",
    "5 . )    to compute the scattering intensity @xmath28 and compare to the results of small - angle x - rays or neutron experiments , it is necessary to introduce a form factor @xmath110 for the gel particles .",
    "one can use for instance the form factor of spheres with radius @xmath111 , @xmath112/(qr)^3 $ ] .",
    "the curve @xmath113 then differs from @xmath33 in the large-@xmath103 regime ( @xmath114 ) where it follows the porod law @xmath115@xcite . on the other hand , the intermediate",

    "it is worth noting that the dlca simulated structure factors present a more pronounced maximum at @xmath118 than the experimental curves @xmath28 , as already noticed in the literature@xcite .",
    "there are obviously large scale inhomogeneities in actual aerogels that are not reproduced in the simulations .",
    "moreover , as emphasized in refs.@xcite , there are some significant details that are neglected in the dlca model , such as the rotational diffusion of the aggregates , their polydispersity and irregular form , and all kinds of possible restructurating effects .",

    "the minimum disappears as the last voids in the gel fill with liquid ( note the difference in the vertical scales of figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) ) , and finally , as one reaches saturation ( at @xmath142 ) , the shape of the gel - gel correlation function @xmath128 is approximately recovered , in accordance with babinet principle@xcite .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in the cross correlation function @xmath126 in fig . 4 , but the minimum occurs at a smaller distance ( its location is approximately @xmath143 when it disappears ) .",

    "the main feature in @xmath81 is the presence of a broad peak that grows and moves towards smaller wavevector as the fluid condenses in the porous space .",
    "this peak is clearly associated to the minimum in @xmath76 ( its location is approximately proportional to @xmath148 ) and it thus tells us the same story : the growing of a characteristic length scale in the fluid along the capillary rise .",
    "the peak disappears in the last stage of the adsorption process and is then replaced by a plateau ( see curve 7 in fig . 5 ) .",
    "finally , at @xmath149 , one recovers a structure factor that can be deduced from @xmath150 by a linear transformation , in accordance with babinet principle ( there are no oscillations in @xmath81 , however , because the fluid - fluid hard - core diameter is zero ) .",
    "the evolution of the gel - fluid cross structure factor @xmath30 is somewhat different .",
    "the peak is more prominent , as a consequence of the ` no - fluctuation ' condition @xmath151 ( this feature may not be so pronounced in actual systems because of large - scale fluctuations ) , and it is located at a larger wavevector than in @xmath81 ( in line with the corresponding locations of the minima in @xmath76 and @xmath126 ) . the most substantial difference with @xmath81 is that the amplitude of the peak starts to decrease much before the end of the adsorption process .",
    "the negative correlation observed at saturation is again due to complementarity with the gel - gel structure@xcite .",
    "we have repeated these calculations at @xmath125 in order to investigate the influence of temperature . in the @xmath1 gel , @xmath125 is just below @xmath152 , the temperature at which the hysteresis loop disappears ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . @xmath76 and @xmath126 still exhibit a minimum that moves towards larger @xmath129 upon adsorption .",
    "however , the characteristic length @xmath147 , associated to the minimum of @xmath76 , does not exceed @xmath153 lattice spacings , indicating that the size of the inhomogeneities in the fluid decreases with increasing @xmath154 .",
    "a similar observation was made in ref.@xcite concerning the size of the avalanches which become more compact at higher temperature and often correspond to a condensation event occuring in a single cavity of the aerogel .",
    "the shape of the corresponding structure factors does not change significantly with respect to the @xmath123 case , but the amplitude is significanly reduced : the maximal amplitudes of the peaks in @xmath81 and @xmath30 are divided approximately by @xmath136 and @xmath26 , respectively .    as shown in refs.@xcite",
    ", temperature has a much more dramatic influence on the adsorption process in gels of higher porosity .",
    "in particular , at low enough temperature ( @xmath155 with @xmath156 in the @xmath109 gel@xcite ) , a macroscopic avalanche occurs at a certain value of the chemical potential , with the whole sample filling abruptly , which results in a discontinuous isotherm in the thermodynamic limit . in a finite system ,",
    "the signature of a macroscopic avalanche is a large jump in the fluid density whose location in @xmath12 fluctuates from sample to sample , which results in a steep but smooth isotherm after an average over the gel realizations ( one then has to perform a finite - size scaling study to conclude on the proper behavior in the thermodynamic limit@xcite ) . within a grand canonical calculation",
    ", there is unfortunately no way to study the evolution of the structural properties of the fluid during a macroscopic avalanche as this would require to consider intermediate fluid densities that are inaccessible@xcite ( the situation would be different if the fluid density was controlled instead of the chemical potential , as is done frequently in experiments@xcite ) .",
    "all we can do is to study the @xmath109 gel at a higher temperature where the adsorption is still gradual , for instance at @xmath125 . in this case",
    ", no qualitative change is found with respect to the case of the @xmath157 gel at @xmath123 .",
    "indeed , as emphasized in ref.@xcite , adsorption proceeds similarly in a high - porosity gel at high temperature and in a lower - porosity gel at low temperature .",
    "the correlation length @xmath147 is somewhat larger in the @xmath109 gel ( beyond @xmath158 lattice spacings ) so that finite - size effects come into play ( in particular , it becomes problematic to extraplotate @xmath81 to @xmath159 so as to simulate the infinite - size limit ) . to go to lower temperatures",
    ", it would be thus necessary to use a much larger simulation box , which would increase considerably the computational work .",
    "note that one expects @xmath76 to decay algebraically at the critical temperature @xmath160 .",
    "indeed , according to the analogy with the @xmath161 nonequilibrium random - field ising model ( rfim ) , there should be only one important length scale in the system close to criticality , length scale which is proportional to the average linear extent of the largest avalanches@xcite . at criticality , this correlation length diverges .",
    "as discussed in detail in refs.@xcite , different mechanisms may be responsible for gas desorption in aerogels , depending on porosity and temperature .",
    "in contrast with adsorption , the outer surface of the material where the adsorbed fluid is in contact with the external vapor may play an essential role .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath1 aerogel at @xmath123 , the theory predicts a phenomenon akin to percolation invasion : as @xmath12 is decreased from saturation , some gas  fingers \" enter the sample and grow until they percolate at a certain value of @xmath12 , forming a fractal , isotropic cluster .",
    "the desorption then proceeds gradually via the growth of the gaseous domain .",
    "accordingly , in the thermodynamic limit , the isotherm shows a cusp at the percolation threshold followed by a steep but continuous decrease ( the cusp is rounded in finite samples ) .",
    "the simulation of the desorption process thus requires the use of an explicit external reservoir adjacent to the gel sample , which of course introduces a severe anisotropy in the model and makes it difficult to calculate radially averaged correlation functions . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we have used another procedure where the desorption is not initiated by the interface with an external reservoir but triggered by the presence of gas bubbles inside the material . we have indeed observed in our previous studies ( see fig . 16 in ref.@xcite ) that the last desorption scanning curves ( obtained by stopping the adsorption just before saturation and then decreasing the chemical potential ) look very much like the desorption isotherms obtained in presence of a reservoir ( when averaging the fluid density deep inside the aerogel , which gives a good estimate of the isotherm in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "near the end of the adsorption process , the remaining gaseous domain is composed of isolated bubbles which obviously play the same role as an external reservoir when the chemical potential is decreased .",
    "the advantage of initiating the desorption with these last bubbles is that one can use the same geometry as during adsorption , with periodic boundary conditions in all directions ( moreover , using small bubbles instead of a planar interface of size @xmath162 considerably suppresses finite - size effects ) .    in practice",
    ", the calculation has been performed by keeping five bubbles in each sample .",
    "this implies that the chemical potential at which desorption is initiated is slightly different in each sample ( if one chooses the same @xmath12 in all samples , some of them may be already completely filled with liquid ) .",
    "this number of bubbles results from a compromise : on the one hand , keeping a single bubble may not be sufficient to trigger the desorption process ( in some samples , the growth of the bubble is hindered by the neighboring gel particles and the desorption occurs at a much lower value of the chemical potential ) ; on the other hand , keeping too many bubbles results in a too rapid growth of the gas domain . as can be seen in fig .",
    "2 , the isotherm obtained with this procedure is indeed very close to the isotherm calculated in presence of an external reservoir .",
    "the fluid - fluid and solid - fluid correlation functions computed at several points along the desorption branch are shown in figs . 7 and 8 .     along the desorption isotherm in a @xmath1 porosity aerogel at @xmath123 .",

    "when @xmath12 is decreased further , the peak in @xmath81 is recovered and the curves become more similar to the ones computed on the adsorption branch .    the linear regime in @xmath81 strongly suggests the presence of fractal correlations@xcite . however , according to our previous studies@xcite , it is only the _ gaseous _ domain that should be a fractal object at the percolation threshold , as illustrated by the isotropic and strongly ramified structure shown in fig .",

    ", one must consider either the ` gas - gas ' correlation function ( defining the quantity @xmath177 which is equal to @xmath132 only in the gas phase ) or the complementary function that measures the correlations within the dense ( solid or liquid ) phase ( one then defines @xmath178 ) .",

    "an accurate determination of @xmath187 would therefore require a much larger system and , at this stage , it is not possible to decide if the fractal dimension is consistent with that of random percolation . in any case , these results strongly suggest that the gas domain exhibits fractal correlations during desorption , correlations which have no relation with the underlying gel microstructure ( we recall that there is almost no fractal regime in the @xmath1 aerogel , as can be seen in fig .",

    "indeed , @xmath76 has no more a long - range tail and the correlations are very similar during adsorption and desorption , as could be expected from the very thin shape of hysteresis loop .",
    "this is the signature that the desorption mechanism has changed , in agreement with the analysis of refs.@xcite .",
    "it is now due to a cavitation phenomenon in which gas bubbles first appear in the largest cavities of the gel and then grow and coalesce until the whole void space is invaded@xcite .     along the desorption isotherm in a @xmath1 porosity aerogel at @xmath125 .",
    "( color on line).,width=340 ]    we have not studied the correlations during desorption in the @xmath109 porosity gel . at very high temperature ( @xmath189 )",
    ", desorption is expected to be due again to cavitation@xcite , and the results shoud be similar to those in the @xmath1 that have just been described . on the other hand , at low temperature ( e.g. @xmath123 ) , the theory predicts a depinning transition in which a self - affine interface sweeps through the whole sample , resulting in a discontinuous desorption isotherm@xcite .",
    "therefore , like in the case of the macroscopic avalanche during adsorption , the correlations along the isotherm can not be studied within the framework of a grand - canonical calculation . at intermediate temperatures , one could probably observe again extended fractal correlations associated to a percolating cluster of gas , but this study requires the use of larger systems so as to probe smaller values of @xmath103 and discriminate the effects due to the own fractal structure of the gel .",
    "as mentionned in the introduction , there have been two recent scattering studies of gas condensation in aerogels , both with @xmath0he@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "light scattering is used to study adsorption and desorption in a @xmath109 porosity gel at several temperatures between @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) and @xmath192 ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "these experimental results can not be directly compared to our theoretical predictions , and our system size is too small to investigate the large - scale inhomogeneities that are seen in the experiments ( some of them are visible to the eye ) . however , there are two key observations that appear to be in agreement with our predictions : i ) at the lowest temperature studied , the optical signal due to helium adsorption is larger than if the fluid density was simply correlated to the density of silica , indicating that the correlations within the fluid extend beyond the aerogel correlation length , and ii ) the aerogel is much brighter during desorption , indicating that the characteristic size of the density fluctuations is much larger than during adsorption .",
    "this latter conclusion was also reached from the small - angle x - ray scattering measurements ( saxs ) performed in a @xmath194 porosity aerogel at @xmath195 ( @xmath196)@xcite . saxs is particularly well suited for observing the structural features associated to fluid adsorption , and in order to compare more easily to experiments we shall push further our calculations and compute the resulting scattered intensity .",
    "of course , the predictions must be taken with a grain of salt , considering the limitations in the model and the theory .",
    "since the scattered intensity is proportional to the fourier transform of the electron density fluctuations , one has @xmath197 where @xmath110 is the form factor of silica particles ( see section iiia ) and @xmath198 is the ratio of the electron density in the adsorbed fluid to that in the solid . as an additional approximation , we shall take @xmath199 , restricting the study to the range @xmath200 where this is presumably a reasonable approximation ( in real units this corresponds to @xmath201 nm@xmath121 , taking @xmath202 nm ) . assuming that the adsorbed liquid has the same density as the bulk liquid at @xmath203 , and using the tabulated densities of helium and silica",
    ", one finds that @xmath198 varies from @xmath204 at @xmath123 to @xmath205 at @xmath125 .",
    "the theoretical scattered intensities during adsorption and desorption in the @xmath1 gel at @xmath123 are shown in figs .",
    "13 and 14 .",
    "like in the experiments@xcite , we plot the ratio @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the contribution of the empty aerogel ( the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "17 ) in order to accentuate the effects of the adsorbed gas , especially in the initial stage of adsorption .",
    "moreover , we hope that this also partially corrects the small-@xmath103 defects due to the absence of large - scale fluctuations in the dlca gel structure factor .     of the scattered intensity @xmath28 to the scattered intensity @xmath207 of the empty aerogel during helium adsorption in a @xmath1 aerogel at @xmath123 .",
    "the dashed line coresponding to @xmath208 is shown for reference ( color on line).,width=377 ]        the main features of the curves displayed in fig .",
    "13 are the following : i ) at the very beginning of adsorption , @xmath209 slightly increases but remains almost independent of @xmath103 .",
    "this is the signature of the @xmath0he film coating the aerogel . in this regime ,",
    "the main contribution to the scattered intensity comes from the gel - fluid correlations ( the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "ii ) as @xmath12 increases , the scattering grows in intensity at small @xmath103 , reflecting the presence of the broad peak in @xmath81 that moves towards smaller wavevector with filling ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "iii ) as the aerogel fills further , @xmath209 decreases until it becomes again almost flat at complete filling .",
    "the total intensity is then reduced with respect to that of the empty aerogel .",
    "direct comparison with the experimental results of ref.@xcite is again problematic : the adsorption isotherm in the @xmath194 gel is indeed very steep at @xmath195 , suggesting that one may be in the regime of a macroscopic avalanche .",
    "however , the behavior of the experimental @xmath209 is remarkably similar to what have just been described ( preliminary measurements in a @xmath210 aerogel@xcite also show the same trends ) .",
    "the results of ref.@xcite were interpreted according to a model of two - phase coexistence , with a ` film ' phase in equilibrium with a filled ` pore ' phase .",
    "this is at odds with the theoretical scenario discussed in refs.@xcite which emphasizes the nonequilibrium character of the transition .",
    "the present results seem to show that this approach can also elucidate ( at least qualitatively ) the behavior of the scattered intensity .    during desorption , the most characteristic feature of the curves shown in fig .",
    "14 is the very significant increase of the ratio @xmath209 at small @xmath103 with respect to adsorption ( note the logarithmic scale on the vertical axis ) .",
    "this is related to the corresponding increase in @xmath81 shown in fig .",
    "9 and is clearly due to the presence of long - range correlations within the fluid .",
    "as the desorption proceeds , @xmath209 goes through a maximum and then decreases until it becomes flat again . remarkably , no power - law fractal regime is visible in @xmath209 in the range @xmath211 as was the case with @xmath179 in fig .",
    "it is the small value of @xmath198 ( due to the small electron density of he ) , and not the division by @xmath207 , which is responsible for this unfortunate disappearance ( @xmath28 becomes proportional to @xmath179 when @xmath212 , which is only the case in a contrast matching experiment ) . in the measurements of ref.@xcite ,",
    "this increase of @xmath209 at small @xmath103 is not mentionned , but the analysis of the data shows that the charateristic size of the inhomogeneities is much larger than during adsorption , as already mentionned , and that it decreases rapidly in the last stage of desorption .",
    "not surprisingly , the theoretical scattered intensity in the @xmath1 aerogel is considerably smaller at high temperature , as illustrated in fig .",
    "15 for @xmath125 .",
    "the intensity ratio @xmath209 has been divided by about @xmath213 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the magnitude of the scattered intensity can indicate that the nature of the desorption process has changed .",
    "we leave to our colleague experimentalists the challenge of checking the presence of a fractal - regime during desorption , as was done in vycor@xcite and xerogel@xcite .",
