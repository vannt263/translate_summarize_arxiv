    "models of low - energy supersymmetry can add many new parameters to the standard model .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) is minimal only in its choice of particle content .",
    "the number of free parameters of the model is quite large unless additional theoretical assumptions are imposed .",
    "the parameter freedom of the mssm is due mostly to soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters , whose theoretical origins are unknown .",
    "it is common practice to treat the parameters of the mssm as running parameters and impose a particular structure on the soft supersymmetry breaking terms at a common high energy scale [ such as the planck scale ( @xmath7 ) or grand unification ( gut ) scale ( @xmath8 ) ] . using the renormalization group equations ( rges )",
    ", one can then derive the values of the low - energy mssm parameters .    a particularly attractive framework , which we will adopt in this paper , consists of assuming universality of soft breaking parameters at the high - energy unifying scale .",
    "universality is a desirable property not only to reduce the number of independent model parameters , but also to avoid unsuppressed flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) @xcite .",
    "universality of scalar and gaugino mass parameters in the high energy theory is an automatic consequence of the _ minimal _ supergravity ( sugra ) framework @xcite and approximately holds in several string - derived sugra scenarios @xcite .    the resulting low - energy supersymmetric theory that emerges depends on five supersymmetric model parameters : a common scalar mass @xmath9 , a common gaugino mass @xmath10 , a common flavor - diagonal trilinear scalar coupling @xmath11 , a supersymmetric higgs mass parameter @xmath12 , and an off - diagonal higgs squared - mass parameter @xmath13 ( often called @xmath14 ) .",
    "these parameters are high - energy scale parameters ( defined at either @xmath15 or @xmath7 ) and serve as initial conditions for the rges .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking in the low - energy theory is radiatively generated when one of the higgs squared - masses is driven negative by renormalization group ( rg ) running .",
    "then , by imposing the minimum conditions for the higgs potential , one can eliminate @xmath16 and @xmath13 in favor of the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "the sign of @xmath12 is not fixed in this procedure and remains a free parameter .",
    "clearly , the previously described sugra theory is a highly constrained version of the mssm .",
    "nevertheless , there can be additional interesting constraints .",
    "in particular , certain low - energy mssm parameters are sometimes very insensitive to the initial high energy values of the sugra parameters .",
    "such a possibility is very exciting , since it offers a potential for understanding the physical value of some low - energy parameters without a detailed knowledge of the physics at high energies .",
    "the classic example of the scenario just described is the quasi - infrared fixed point ( ifp ) prediction for the top - quark yukawa coupling @xcite for sufficiently large @xmath21 .",
    "however , in practice @xmath22 is not large enough , so the pr fixed point solution does not govern the low - energy value of the top - quark yukawa coupling . on the other hand , it follows from that the top - quark yukawa coupling is driven to the quasi - infrared fixed point as long as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 . ] .",
    "as is well known @xcite , the one - loop rge of the top - quark yukawa coupling , @xmath25 , can be integrated analytically for moderate values of @xmath26 : [ yt ] y_t(t)= , with [ ef ] e(t)= ( 1+_3t)^16/3b_3(1+_2t)^3/b_2 ( 1+_1t)^13/9b_1,f(t)=_0^te(t)dt. in , @xmath27 are the one - loop beta functions of the gauge couplings @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the renormalization scale .",
    "this one - loop behavior leads to the existence of the quasi - infrared fixed point .",
    "namely , for @xmath32 , [ ifp ] y_t(t)y_f(t ) .",
    "numerically , one finds that @xmath33 at the electroweak scale differs negligibly from @xmath34 for a wide range of @xmath35 , so in this sense the low - energy value of @xmath33 is indeed insensitive to its high - energy value @xmath36 .",
    "the value of the top - quark mass depends both on the low - energy values of @xmath33 and @xmath1 , so at this stage we do not have a prediction for the top - quark mass .",
    "nevertheless , the parameter freedom has been reduced , since given the top - quark mass , @xmath1 is now predicted .",
    "actually , @xmath1 typically turns out to be near 1 , in which case the previous derivation is fully justified . in this paper , we will not address this large @xmath1 scenario since , in the minimal sugra approach described above , it requires a precise ( unnatural ) fine - tuning of high - energy parameters in order to ensure the correct radiative electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . ] .    in this paper , we focus on the prediction of the light cp - even higgs mass ( @xmath0 ) in the ifp scenario as a function of the minimal sugra parameters .",
    "we improve on previous work in the literature by taking into account a number of effects not fully considered before .",
    "these include : ( i ) corrections to @xmath1 due to supersymmetric thresholds ; ( ii ) evolution of @xmath1 from the electroweak scale to the supersymmetry - breaking scale ; and ( iii ) a precise evaluation of radiative electroweak breaking and of the top - squark ( stop ) mixing parameter .",
    "all these effects have a significant impact on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we have computed @xmath0 using the most refined methods available , including subdominant radiative corrections and contributions from stop non - degeneracy .",
    "this substantially reduces the theoretical uncertainty of our results with respect to previous literature .",
    "our final result on the upper bound on the higgs mass has important implications for the lep-2 higgs search .    in section  2 ,",
    "we discuss the ifp scenario and the calculation of @xmath1 , as well as the stop mixing parameter , including all the new effects mentioned above .",
    "we address a number of effects not previously considered , which can significantly affect the predicted value of @xmath1 and the higgs mass . in section  3 ,",
    "we review the dependence of the higgs mass on the supersymmetric parameters . in section  4 , we explore the consequences of the ifp scenario for the predicted value of the higgs mass , giving full numerical results and comparing to the previous literature .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  5 .",
    "in section  1 , we reviewed the quasi - infrared fixed point ( ifp ) scenario in which the low - energy value of the top - quark higgs yukawa coupling is driven to a quasi - infrared fixed point value , @xmath34 .",
    "formally , this limit is derived by taking @xmath37 .",
    "this is not theoretically consistent as it stands , since the derivation given above was based on a one - loop rge , while large values of @xmath36 clearly lie outside the perturbative regime .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the domain of attraction of the quasi - ifp is large and accurately represented by the one - loop approximation .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 rapidly approaches @xmath34 , even for values of @xmath36 still in the perturbative region .",
    "this allows one to consider the ifp limit as a meaningful physical possibility .",
    "for example , starting with @xmath38 the one - loop value of @xmath39 at the weak scale differs from @xmath34 by @xmath40 . in this paper , we employ two - loop rges for the evolution of the gauge and yukawa couplings . for definiteness , we choose @xmath38 , although the results are insensitive to this choice , as argued above .",
    "another subtlety concerning the precise definition of the ifp scenario is the choice of the unification scale @xmath41 and of @xmath42 . here , we follow the approach of .",
    "first , we take the experimental values of @xmath43 as input parameters and evaluate the corresponding supersymmetric @xmath44 values , @xmath45 , taking into account all the supersymmetric threshold corrections [ the @xmath45 do not have a direct physical meaning ; see for more details ] .",
    "then , the two - loop running of @xmath46 , @xmath47 to high scales defines a unification scale @xmath41 and a  unified \" coupling constant @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the running of @xmath49 from @xmath50 to @xmath41 gives the value of @xmath51 .",
    "in general , the latter does not coincide ( even within the error bars ) with @xmath52 , although the difference is small and can be attributed to , for instance , threshold corrections either from a gut or stringy origin .    the ifp scenario defined in the context of the sugra approach",
    "depends on additional parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath1 and sign(@xmath12 ) as described in section  1 . however , the subset of independent parameters is substantially smaller . in the ifp scenario ,",
    "the low - energy value of @xmath53 ( the trilinear scalar coupling of the higgs boson and stops ) is also driven to an infrared quasi - fixed point @xcite . at the one - loop level [ at ] a_t(t)m , where @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath55 in the ifp limit is irrelevant . although this is not true for the remaining trilinear couplings @xmath56 , etc .",
    ", the latter @xmath11-parameters have a negligible effect in the determination of the higgs mass , which is the main goal of this paper .",
    "the value of @xmath1 , evaluated at the scale @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the physical top - quark mass ) , is determined by using [ h2 ] v_2(m_t ) = , and the approximate @xmath59 relation @xcite [ v2 ] v ( ) .",
    "the distinction between the physical top - quark mass @xmath58 and the running top - quark mass @xmath60 should not be ignored .",
    "explicitly , the physical top - quark mass is given by [ mt ] m_t = m_t(m_t ) , where the one - loop correction @xmath61 receives two important contributions : the well - known qcd gluon correction scheme should be compared with 4 in the @xmath62 scheme @xcite . ] [ dmtqcd ] ( ) _ qcd= , and the stop / gluino correction @xcite [ dmtsusy ] ( ) _ susy= & & .- \\{b_1(m_t , m_g , m_t_1 ) + b_1(m_t , m_g , m_t_2 ) + & & -.(2_t ) } , where @xmath63 is the stop mixing angle , @xmath64 , and b_n(p;m_1,m_2)-_0 ^ 1 dx x^n .",
    "note that the standard model two - loop qcd correction @xcite and the electroweak correction @xcite are each of order 1% and almost cancel one another .",
    "while the one - loop gluon correction [ ] yields a 6% relative top - quark mass shift , the supersymmetric correction in our scenario is of the same sign and can be as large as the gluon correction for @xmath65 gev .",
    "the stop / gluino correction ( which increases with the supersymmetric masses ) is a consequence of working in the effective supersymmetric theory without decoupling the supersymmetric particles , as is usually done in the ifp literature when considering the running of @xmath33 .",
    "( in practice , this is the most convenient way to perform the analysis ; for an alternative approach , see . )",
    "however , the correction given by  has never been included in the published analyses of the ifp scenario .",
    "this correction has the noteworthy effect of reducing the ratio @xmath66 , and consequently lowering the ifp value of @xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "the predicted value for the mass of the light cp - even higgs boson is significantly reduced , as shown in section  4 .",
    "let us now turn to the @xmath12-parameter .",
    "we noted in section  1 that @xmath12 can be determined ( up to a sign ) by imposing the condition of electroweak symmetry breaking and fixing the @xmath67 mass to its physical value .",
    "more precisely , from the minimization of the renormalization - group - improved tree - level higgs potential , we obtain [ mu ] ^2+= ( m_h_1 ^ 2 - ^2  m_h_2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath68 are the low - energy values of the soft squared - masses of the @xmath69 higgs fields ( subject to the condition @xmath70 at @xmath71 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the result given in is only accurate enough if the tree - level potential is evaluated at a scale where the radiative corrections are minimized .",
    "this essentially happens for a scale of order the stop masses @xcite . from now",
    "on we will take that scale , @xmath72 , as the average of the stop squared - mass eigenvalues [ ms ] m_s^2 ( m__1 ^ 2 + m__2 ^ 2 ) .",
    "consequently , all the quantities appearing in  ( including @xmath12 and @xmath50 ) are to be taken at @xmath73 . to the tree - level potential @xmath74 , and using accordingly modified ,",
    "is not in general a precise procedure since @xmath75 at @xmath76 still yields inaccurate results if @xmath77 , as it is normally the case @xcite ( see the comments at the end of the appendix ) . ] from ,  _ plus _ the renormalization group evolution of @xmath78 , @xmath79 with their anomalous dimensions , we can determine the value of @xmath80 at any scale using the corresponding rge for @xmath1 : [ tbetarge ] y_t .",
    "this result can be employed to determine the value of @xmath1 at @xmath72 .",
    "the running of @xmath1 has been ignored in the ifp literature and produces significant corrections in the final results .    from  and",
    "it follows that the only relevant independent parameters for predicting the light cp - even higgs mass @xmath0 in the ifp scenario are @xmath9 and @xmath10 . these can be traded in for @xmath72 and @xmath81 .",
    "notice that in either case sign@xmath82 may be absorbed , by a redefinition of fields , into the sign of @xmath10 ( or equivalently , the sign of @xmath83 ) .",
    "besides the simplicity of this scenario , the fact that all the relevant low - energy quantities can be expressed in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath83 has important consequences for the prediction of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the mass splitting between stops and the effective mixing in  is opposite to the one employed in . ] [ xt ] x_ta_t+ , which play an important role in the computation of @xmath0 ( see section  3 ) are no longer independent parameters , but are calculable quantities in terms of @xmath72 and @xmath83 .",
    "since they can not be simultaneously  tuned \" to the values that maximize @xmath0 , this produces an effective lowering of the upper bound on @xmath0 .",
    "these issues will be carefully analyzed in the next two sections .",
    "there is yet another source of constraints on the theory , namely the desirable absence of dangerous charge and color breaking ( ccb ) minima @xcite or unbounded from below ( ufb ) directions @xcite in the scalar potential .",
    "ccb and ufb constraints have been recently analyzed for the ifp scenario @xcite .",
    "since all the physics in which we are interested depends on just two parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath9 ( or equivalently @xmath72 and @xmath83 ) , we must focus on the ccb and ufb constraints involving these quantities .",
    "this means , in particular , that the ccb constraints involving the trilinear scalar couplings other than the top one , @xmath84 @xmath85 etc .",
    ", have no relevance to us since their low - energy values may be tuned at will by varying the initial high - energy parameter @xmath55 .",
    "this is not the case for the low - energy top trilinear scalar coupling @xmath53 , which in our scenario is driven to an infrared fixed point given by  [ more generally , by ] , namely @xmath86 .",
    "this value , however , is well inside the region allowed by the ccb bounds @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "ufb bounds strongly restrict the @xmath87 parameter @xcite in the ifp scenario , namely the absence of ufb directions requires @xmath88 . in any case",
    ", the results presented in section  4 imply that for @xmath89 the value of @xmath0 hardly changes as a function of @xmath83 ( @xmath84it already reaches its large-@xmath83 asymptotic limit at @xmath90 ) .",
    "thus , in practice the ccb and ufb constraints do not restrict the bounds on @xmath0 in the ifp scenario .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm consists of five physical states : two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 ) , one neutral cp - odd scalar @xmath94 , and a charged higgs pair @xmath95 .",
    "the quadratic terms of the higgs potential consists of two diagonal squared - mass terms : @xmath96 , and one off - diagonal squared - mass term : @xmath13 .",
    "when the minimum condition is imposed , the diagonal squared - mass terms are traded in for the vacuum expectation values @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the tree - level higgs sector depends on only two new parameters : @xmath1 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to replace @xmath13 with the physical parameter @xmath97 .",
    "then , all other higgs masses and couplings can be expressed at tree level in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath97 .",
    "the prediction for the mass of the lightest cp - even neutral higgs boson is of particular interest to the lep higgs search , since this higgs scalar would be discovered first if it lies within the reach of the lep-2 collider . in particular",
    ", the mssm predicts that at tree level , @xmath98 . when radiative corrections are included , the light higgs mass upper bound may be significantly increased above the tree level prediction .",
    "this has profound effects on the lep higgs search . lep-2",
    "running at its maximum energy ( @xmath99  gev ) and luminosity is expected to be sensitive to higgs masses up to about 105 gev @xcite .",
    "thus , the possibility of large radiative corrections to @xmath0 implies that lep can not be sensitive to the full mssm higgs sector parameter space .",
    "the mass of @xmath91 can be calculated in terms of the two parameters of the higgs sector mentioned above ( @xmath100 and @xmath1 ) and other mssm soft - supersymmetry - breaking parameters that affect the higgs mass through virtual loops .",
    "the largest contribution to the one - loop radiative corrections is enhanced by a factor of @xmath101 and grows logarithmically with the stop mass .",
    "thus , higher - order radiative corrections can be non - negligible for large stop masses , in which case the large logarithms must be resummed using renormalization group techniques @xcite .    for our numerical work",
    ", we will follow the simple analytic procedure for accurately approximating @xmath0 described in , where further details can be found .",
    "similar results are obtained by using the alternative approximation of .",
    "these analytic formulae incorporate both the leading one - loop and two - loop effects and the rg improvement .",
    "also included are the leading effects at one loop of the supersymmetric thresholds ( the most important effects of this type are squark mixing effects in the third generation ) .    in the limit @xmath102 , which holds in the ifp scenario ,",
    "only @xmath91 remains light ( with couplings nearly identical to those of the standard model higgs boson ) , and its squared - mass including rg improvement is given by a formula of the form is small , and so they are not shown explicitly in , although they were included in our numerical analysis . ]",
    "@xcite [ mhhhh ] ^2(^2)_1ll+ ( ^2)_mix , where _ t,_tm_s .",
    "in particular , the numerically integrated rg - improved cp - even higgs mass is well approximated by replacing all occurrences of @xmath103 in @xmath104 and @xmath105 by the corresponding running masses evaluated at the judicious choice of scales indicated above .",
    "the first term in  is the one - loop leading logarithmic contribution to the squared mass , given by [ mh1ll ] ( ^2)_1ll^22 + ( ) , where @xmath1 is evaluated at @xmath50 and @xmath106 .",
    "subdominant terms not written in  can also be important for a precise determination of @xmath0 . they can be found in and were included in our numerical analysis .",
    "the second term in  adds the important effects of stop mixing ; it takes the form ( again we display here only the dominant terms ) [ deltamix ] ( ^2)_mix m_t^4(_t)\\{x_t^2 } , where @xmath107 is given by , and h(a , b)&= , + g(a , b)&= ( 2-a+ba - b ) . using these results , the full ( numerically integrated ) rg - improved value of @xmath0 is reproduced to within an accuracy of about 2  gev ( assuming that supersymmetric particle masses lie below 2 tev ) .    for @xmath108 , we may approximate @xmath109 and @xmath110 . then  simplifies and takes the form @xmath111 from  it is easy to see that the maximal value of @xmath105 , and thus @xmath0 , is achieved for @xmath112 , which is sometimes called `` maximal mixing '' .",
    "for this value of @xmath113 , the quantity in curly brackets in is equal to 6 . for larger values of @xmath113",
    "this correction decreases , eventually turning negative . in the ifp scenario",
    "the approximation of nearly degenerate stops is not always applicable ( particularly for small values of @xmath114 , as shown in fig .  1 ) , and",
    "one must include the stop mixing corrections in its full form [ ] . in the latter case , @xmath105 does not follow the simple behaviour discussed for the approximately mass - degenerate case ; for example , values larger than 6 for the term in curly brackets in  can result .",
    "as an example , one finds the following mass bounds for @xmath91 , assuming @xmath3  gev and @xmath115  tev : @xmath116  gev if stop mixing is negligible , while @xmath117  gev if stop mixing is `` maximal '' . in both cases",
    "the upper bound corresponds to large @xmath1 .",
    "when the ifp scenario is imposed , the parameter restrictions examined in section  2 ( @xmath84 both @xmath1 and @xmath53 are driven to fixed - point values ) imply that the higgs mass upper limits quoted above are not saturated .",
    "consequently the predicted value of @xmath0 decreases substantially . in section  4",
    ", we shall explore in detail the predictions for @xmath0 in the ifp scenario as a function of the remaining free parameters .",
    "for the sake of definiteness and to facilitate the comparison with previous results in the literature , we first present detailed results for @xmath118 tev .",
    "subsequently , we will allow @xmath72 to vary .",

    "@xmath120 $ ] , since for @xmath121 all the relevant quantities enter an asymptotic regime , as will be apparent from the figures .",
    "in addition , as explained at the end of section  2 , the values @xmath122 are in conflict with ccb and ufb bounds .    in fig .  1 we plot the two stop mass eigenvalues @xmath123 as a function of @xmath83 .",
    "we note that for @xmath124 the mass of the lightest stop is lower than the present experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "thus , this region is excluded , as indicated in all figures shown in this section .",
    "we also observe that is no longer a good approximation for @xmath105 when @xmath125 , and one must use , as noted at the end of section  3 .",

    "note that this correction is in general quite important . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the usual qcd correction , @xmath127 ( constant dashed line ) . although the supersymmetric correction does not always have a definite sign in general models ( as noted in ) , this correction is always of the same sign as the qcd correction in the ifp scenario considered in this paper .",
    "this feature is a result of the constraints imposed on the stop and gluino masses .",
    "moreover , the larger the positive value of @xmath61 , the lower the value of @xmath1 .",

    "taking into account the experimental error of about 5  gev in the measured top quark mass , we exhibit in fig",
    ".  6 the predicted value of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath83 for @xmath118  tev and three choices of top quark mass . for the maximal value of @xmath152  gev",
    ", we see that the predicted upper bound of @xmath0 is increased by about 5  gev , compared to the previous results shown ( for the central value of @xmath3  gev ) .",
    "we also note that for @xmath153  gev , the @xmath83 dependence is somewhat less pronounced , with the predicted value of @xmath0 above 88  gev over the entire allowed range of @xmath83 .",
    "if we impose @xmath151  tev , we conclude that the upper bound of the light cp - even higgs mass in the ifp scenario is about 95105  gev ( for @xmath154  gev ) , although the upper bound is not saturated over a significant region of the minimal sugra parameter space .",
    "the quasi - infrared fixed point model is very attractive , since a number of quite general and well - motivated initial conditions lead to a highly predictive low - energy scenario .",
    "more precisely , working within the sugra framework ( with the assumption of universality of scalar and gaugino soft - supersymmetry - breaking masses ) , the only two independent parameters for low - energy physics are the common ( high - energy ) scalar ( @xmath9 ) and gaugino ( @xmath10 ) masses .",
    "we have studied in this framework the value of the light cp - even higgs mass , @xmath0 , which is a particularly relevant physical quantity since it turns out to be greatly constrained .",
    "we have taken into account some important effects that had not been previously considered .",
    "the most notable of these is the supersymmetric correction to the relation between the running and the physical top - quark masses , which lowers the value of @xmath1 and thus that of @xmath0 .",
    "other effects arise from the precise determination of the stop mixing parameter @xmath107 ( which plays a major role in the computation of @xmath0 ) , as well as the observation that @xmath1 and @xmath107 never conspire to raise @xmath0 to its maximum possible value .",
    "in addition we have computed @xmath0 using the most refined available method , including subdominant contributions and corrections from stop non - degeneracy .",
    "this substantially reduces the theoretical uncertainty of our results with respect to previous calculations in the literature .",
    "our predictions for @xmath0 are significantly lower than previous evaluations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "figure  5 displays our calculation of @xmath0 and exhibits its dependence on @xmath155 for different values of @xmath156 . for @xmath2 tev and @xmath3",
    "gev we find @xmath4  gev ; the upper bound increases slightly for larger values of @xmath72 and @xmath58 . for sensible parameter choices ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath157  gev in the ifp scenario based on the constrained mssm with universal scalar and gaugino mass parameters ( as in minimal sugra and some superstring models ) , and that the most plausible @xmath0 values may be substantially smaller .",
    "these values of @xmath0 are within the reach of the lep-2 higgs search .",
    "if lep-2 fails to discover the @xmath91 , then one will be able to rule out the ifp scenario in the context of sugra models with universal boundary conditions .",
    "of course , this will not rule out all possible sugra models ( or more general versions of the mssm ) , where the upper bound @xmath117  gev quoted at the end of section  3 can still be realized .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth emphasizing that the ifp scenario does not correspond merely to a single point of the supersymmetric parameter space . as noted in section 1 , as long as @xmath35 , the low - energy values of @xmath53 and @xmath1 converge quite closely to their ifp limits ( and independently of the value of the high - energy parameter @xmath55 ) .",
    "thus , the ifp prediction of the higgs mass bound presented in this paper corresponds to a non - negligible region of the space of supersymmetric parameters at the high - energy scale .    finally , it is interesting to note that the bound on @xmath0 obtained in this paper is quite robust .",
    "the effect of a small deviation from the ifp limit leads only to a modest increase in the mass bound of the light cp - even higgs boson .",
    "for example , suppose we take the value of @xmath33 to lie somewhat below its fixed point value @xmath34 , but still close enough such that the dependence of @xmath53 on its high - energy value @xmath55 is negligible .",
    "then , we find that @xmath1 increases from its predicted ifp value , while @xmath129 decreases throughout the @xmath83 range of interest . as a result of these two opposing effects , we find that the upper bound of @xmath0 barely shifts ( although in contrast with the results of figs .  46 , the bound on @xmath0 as a function of @xmath83 is much flatter ) .",
    "as one takes @xmath33 further away from the ifp limit , the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath55 can no longer be neglected .",
    "one can now attain maximal mixing for reasonable choices of @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath1 is increased from its ifp value , the upper bound on @xmath0 also increases . to illustrate these considerations , we computed the light cp - even higgs mass for @xmath118  tev and @xmath158  gev as @xmath33 is reduced below @xmath34 . using the results for @xmath1 shown by the dotted curves in fig",
    ", we find that the upper bound on @xmath0 ( which was 97 gev in the ifp limit ) increases to about 103  gev [ 110  gev ] , for @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "note that away from the ifp limit , the upper bound on @xmath0 is nearly independent of the value of @xmath83 ( since the dependence on @xmath83 in this case enters mainly through @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath91 is not discovered at lep-2 , then one must be somewhat far from the ifp limit examined in this paper . given that lep-2 expects to reach its maximal energy and luminosity during the next two years , it is safe to say that the decisive test for the ifp scenario will soon be at hand .",
    "we are grateful to m. carena , b. de carlos , p. chankowski , r. hempfling , s. pokorski and c.e.m .",
    "wagner for their helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "we would also particularly like to thank f. richard for his probing questions , which led to a more careful discussion of the ultimate accuracy of the higgs mass bounds in the ifp scenario .",
