    "studying the pair plasmas has been an important challenge for many plasma physicists in two past decades . as we know , the difference between the electron and ion masses in an ordinary electron - ion plasma ( in general , multi - component plasma with both light and heavy particles ) gives rise to different time - space scales which are used to simplify the analysis of low- and high - frequency modes .",
    "such time - space parity disappears when studying a pure pair plasma which consisting of only positive- and negative - charged particles with an equal mass , because the mobility of the particles in the electromagnetic fields is the same .",
    "pair plasmas consisting of electrons and positrons have attracted an especial of interest because of their significant applications in astrophysics .",
    "in fact , electron - positron plasmas play an important role in the physics of a number of astrophysical situations such as active galactic nuclei @xcite , pulsar and neutron star magnetosphere @xcite , solar atmosphere @xcite , accretion disk @xcite , black holes @xcite , the early universe @xcite and many others .",
    "for example , the detection of circularly polarized radio emission from the jets of the archtypal quasar 3c297 , indicates that electron - positron pairs are an important component of the jet plasma @xcite .",
    "similar detections in other radio sources suggest that , in general , extragalactic radio jets are composed mainly of an electron - positron plasma @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that the creation of electron - positron plasma in pulsars is essentially by energetic collisions between particles which are accelerated as a result of electric and magnetic fields in such systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the successful achievements for creation of the electron - positron plasmas in laboratories have been frequently reported in the scientific literatures @xcite . in this",
    "regard , many authors have concentrated on the relativistic electron - positron plasmas @xcite because of its occurrence in astrophysics and encountering with positron as an antimatter in high - energy physics .",
    "however , there are many experiments that confirm the possibility of nonrelativistic electron - positron plasmas in laboratory @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the annihilation time of electron - positron pairs in typical experiments is often long compared with typical confinement times @xcite , showing that the lifetime of electron - positron pairs in the plasma is much longer than the characteristic time scales of typical oscillations .",
    "the long lifetime of electron - positron pairs against pair annihilation indicates that many collective modes can occur and propagate in an electron - positron plasma .",
    "although pair plasmas consisting of electrons and positrons have been experimentally produced , however , because of fast annihilation and the formation of positronium atoms and also low densities in typical electron - positron experiments , the identification of collective modes in such experiments is practically very difficult . to resolve this problem ,",
    "one may experimentally deal with a pure pair - ion plasma instead of a pure electron - positron plasma for identification of the collective modes .",
    "an appropriate experimental method has been developed by oohara and hatakeyama @xcite for the generation of pure pair - ion plasmas consisting only positive and negative ions with equal masses by using fullerenes @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the fullerenes are molecules containing 60 carbon atoms in a very regular geometric arrangement , and so a fullerene pair plasma is physically akin to the an electron - positron plasma , without having to worry about fast annihilation . by drastically improving the pair - ion plasma source in order to excite effectively the collective modes , oohara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have experimentally examined the electrostatic modes propagating along the magnetic - field lines in a fullerene pair plasma .    in exploring the electrostatic modes in a pair plasma ,",
    "most of authors have merely studied the high frequency langmuir - type oscillation in a pure electron - positron plasma @xcite or in a pure pair - ion plasma @xcite via the theoretical studies .",
    "particularly , iwamato @xcite and veranjes and poedts @xcite have studied the longitudinal modes in a pair plasma only in the case in which the phase velocity of the wave is much larger than the thermal velocity of the particles which leads to the langmuir - type waves . however , in the experiment of oohara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , three kinds of electrostatic modes have been observed from the obtained dispersion curves : a relatively low - frequency band with nearly constant group velocity ( the acoustic waves ) , an intermediate - frequency backward - like mode ( to our knowledge , with the lack of a satisfactory theoretical explanation ) , and the langmuir - type waves in a relatively high - frequency band .",
    "this experiment indicates that in a pure pair plasma , besides of the langmuir - type waves , the acoustic - like modes are possible in practice .",
    "there , oohara _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have briefly discussed some aspects of their experimental results by using a theoretical two - fluid model . here , our goal is to investigate the possibility and the properties of the intriguing acoustic - like modes in a pair plasma ( in both symmetric and asymmetric cases ) by using a kinetic theory model and to argue some properties of these modes in a subtler manner .",
    "it is to be noted that the only asymmetry in a pure pair plasma may arise from a difference in temperatures of species .",
    "physically , the temperature - asymmetry in a pair plasma may arise from the typical experimental procedure in which a pair plasma is produced in the laboratory .",
    "for example , an effective technique for creating an electron - positron plasma in the laboratory is as follows : at first , we may obtain a positron plasma through scattering from a buffer gas into a panning trap @xcite ; using this technique , the positrons can be stored at densities of order @xmath3 and lifetime of order @xmath4 in the recent experiments .",
    "then , an electron - positron plasma with sufficient stability can be produced by injecting a low - energy electron beam into the positrons @xcite . for our purpose , we assume that the phase speed of the acoustic - like modes lies in the vicinity of the thermal velocities of the species ( in fact , between the thermal velocities of the two species ) .",
    "the situation is somewhat similar to the case in which the possibility and properties of the electron - acoustic waves in a two - temperature ( cold and hot ) electron plasma is examined @xcite .",
    "it is often observed that the physical distribution of particles in space plasmas as well as in laboratory plasmas are not exactly maxwellian and particles show deviations from the thermal distribution @xcite",
    ". presence of nonthermal particles in space plasmas has been widely confirmed by many spacecraft measurements @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the velocity distributions show non - maxwellian tails decreasing as a power - law distribution in particle speed .",
    "several models for phase space plasma distributions with superthermal wings or other deviations from purely maxwellian behavior have become rather popular in recent years , like the so - called kappa ( @xmath5 ) distribution which was introduced initially by vasyliunas in 1968 @xcite for describing plasmas out of the thermal equilibrium such as the magnetosphere environments and the solar winds @xcite , or the nonthermal model advanced by cairns _",
    "@xcite which was introduced at first for an explanation of the solitary electrostatic structures involving density depletions that have been observed in the upper ionosphere in the auroral zone by the freja satellite @xcite , and also the nonextensive model which go under the name of tsallis . in the following we want to briefly review the formalism of the tsallis model and to argue why it is preferred , rather than that of the cairns and kappa model .    from a statistical point of view",
    ", there are numerous studies indicating the breakdown of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics for description of many systems with long - range interactions , long - time memories and fractal space - time structures ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the standard bg extensive thermo - statistics constitutes a powerful tool when microscopic interactions and memories are short ranged and the environment is an euclidean space - time , a continuous and differentiable manifold .",
    "basically , systems subject to the long - range interactions and correlations and long - time memories are related to the nonextensive statistics where the standard bg statistics and its maxwellian distribution do not apply .",
    "the plasma environments in the astrophysical and laboratorial systems are obviously subject to spatial and temporal long - range interactions evolving in a non - euclidean space - time that make their behavior nonextensive",
    ". a suitable generalization of the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) entropy for statistical equilibrium was first proposed by reyni @xcite and subsequently by tsallis @xcite , preserving the usual properties of positivity , equiprobability and irreversibility , but suitably extending the standard extensivity or additivity of the entropy to nonextensivity .    the nonextensive generalization of the bgs entropy which proposed by tsallis in 1988 @xcite is given by the following expression : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the standard boltzmann constant",
    ", @xmath8 denotes the probabilities of the microstate configurations and @xmath9 is a real parameter quantifying the degree of nonextensivity .",
    "the most distinctive feature of @xmath10 is its pseudoadditivity .",
    "given a composite system @xmath11 , constituted by two subsystems @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which are independent in the sense of factorizability of the joint microstate probabilities , the tsallis entropy of the composite system @xmath11 satisfies @xmath14 . in the limit of @xmath15",
    ", @xmath10 reduces to the celebrated logarithmic boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath16 , and the usual additivity of entropy is recovered .",
    "hence , @xmath17 is a measure of the lack of extensivity of the system .",
    "there are numerous evidences exhibiting that the nonextensive statistics , arising from @xmath10 , is a better framework for describing many physical systems such as the galaxy clusters @xcite , the plasmas @xcite , the turbulent systems @xcite , and so on , in which the system shows a nonextensive behavior as a result of long - range interactions and correlations .",
    "the experimental results in such systems display a non - maxwellian velocity distribution for the particles @xcite .",
    "the functional form of the velocity distribution in the tsallis formalism may be derived through a nonextensive generalization of the maxwell ansatz @xcite , or through the maximizing tsallis entropy under the constraints imposed by normalization and the energy mean value @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from a nonextensive generalization of the `` molecular chaos hypothesis '' , it is shown that the equilibrium @xmath9-nonextensive distribution is a natural consequence of the _ h _ theorem @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the empirically derived kappa distribution function in space plasmas is equivalent to the @xmath9-distribution function in tsallis nonextensive formalism , in the sense that the spectrum of the velocity distribution function in both models show the similar behavior and , in fact , both the kappa distribution and the tsallis @xmath9-nonextensive distribution describe deviations from the thermal distribution .",
    "particularly , leubner in 2002 @xcite showed that the distributions very close to the kappa distributions are a consequence of the generalized entropy favored by the nonextensive statistics , and proposed a link between the tsallis nonextensive formalism and the kappa distribution functions .",
    "in fact , relating the parameter @xmath9 to @xmath5 by formal transformation @xmath18 @xcite provides the missing link between the @xmath9-nonextensive distribution and the @xmath5-distribution function favored in space plasma physics , leading to a required theoretical justification for the use of @xmath5-distributions from fundamental physics .",
    "furthermore , livadiotis and mccomas in 2009 @xcite examined how kappa distributions arise naturally from the tsallis statistical mechanics . on the other hand , the nonthermal distribution function introduced by cairns et al .",
    "@xcite is a proposal function to model an electron distribution with a population of energetic particles .",
    "it is especially appropriate for describing the nonlinear propagation of large amplitude electrostatic excitations such as solitary waves and double layers which are very common in the magnetosphere .",
    "however , the lack of a statistical foundation behind this proposal function is clearly seen , leading to less attention to it rather than the kappa function and the tsallis distribution .",
    "anyway , the @xmath9-nonextensive formalism , with a powerful thermo - statistics foundation and numerous experimental evidences , may cover many features of the other nonthermal models and provide a good justification for its preference over the other models .",
    "it has considerably extended both statistical mechanics formalism and its range of applicability .",
    "the interested reader may refer to the refs .",
    "@xcite where the significance , historical background , physical motivations , foundations and applications of the nonextensive thermo - statistics have been discussed in detail .",
    "the problem of waves , landau damping and instabilities in typical plasmas have been investigated by some authors in the framework of the tsallis nonextensive statistics @xcite .",
    "particularly , it is to be noted that the physical state described by the @xmath9-nonextensive distribution in the tsallis s statistics is not exactly the thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "in fact , the deviation of @xmath9 from unity quantifies the degree of inhomogeneity of the temperature @xmath19 via the formula @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 denotes the electric charge of specie @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the electrostatic potential . in other words ,",
    "the nonextensive statistics describes a system that have been evolved from a nonequilibrium stationary state with inhomogeneous temperature which contains a number of nonthermal particles .    in the present work ,",
    "we attempt to investigate the possibility of the acoustic - like modes in a field - free and collisionless pair plasma ( electron - positron or pair - ion ) and to discuss the damping and instability of modes in the context of the tsallis nonextensive statistics . in sec .",
    "2 , a kinetic theory model based on the linearized vlasov and poisson s equations is applied for deriving the dielectric function ( @xmath24 ) for longitudinal waves in an unmagnetized pair plasma .",
    "we then find the solutions of @xmath25 for the acoustic - like waves with the constraint of weak damping or growth by considering a @xmath9-nonextensive distribution for stationary state of the plasma , as demonstrated in sec .",
    "the dispersion relation , landau damping and instability of the acoustic - like modes are discussed in sec .",
    "finally , a summary of our results is given in sec .",
    "in this section , we present a brief review of kinetic equations for describing the electrostatic collective modes specialized to a pair plasma ( electron - positron or pair - ion ) with the constraint of weak damping or growth .",
    "we consider a spatially uniform field - free pair plasma at the equilibrium state .",
    "if at a given time @xmath26 a small amount of charge is displaced in the plasma , the initial perturbation may be described by    @xmath27 where @xmath28 corresponds to the unperturbed and time - independent stationary distribution and @xmath29 is the corresponding perturbation about the equilibrium state . here , @xmath22 stands for electrons and positrons ( @xmath30 ) or fullerene pairs ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we assume that the perturbation is electrostatic and the displacement of charge gives rise to a perturbed electric but no magnetic field . with this assumption ,",
    "the time development of @xmath32 is given by the solution of the linearized vlasov and poisson s equations as follows @xcite : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote , respectively , the absolute charge , mass and number density of the pairs and @xmath39 is the electrostatic potential produced by the perturbation . here",
    ", we have labeled the distribution function of negative and positive pairs with the subscripts @xmath40 .",
    "this set of linearized equations for perturbed quantities may be solved simultaneously to investigate the plasma properties for the time intervals shorter than the binary collision times .",
    "specially , we can study the properties of the plasma waves whose oscillations period are much less than a binary collision time .",
    "the standard technique for simultaneously solving the differential equations ( 2)-(4 ) is the method of integral transforms , as developed for the first time by landau in the case of an ordinary electron - ion plasma @xcite .",
    "another simplified method of solving the vlasov - poisson s equations for the longitudinal waves , with the frequency @xmath41 and the wave vector @xmath42 , is to assume that the solution has the form @xmath43    without loss of the generality , we consider the @xmath44-axis to be along the direction of the wave vector @xmath42 , and let @xmath45 .",
    "then , by applying the eq .",
    "( [ simplified ] ) and solving the eqs .",
    "( [ f1-])-([poisson ] ) we find the dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in a pair plasma as follows @xmath46 where @xmath24 is the dielectric function of a field - free pair plasma for the longitudinal oscillations .",
    "we then can investigate the response of the pair plasma to an arbitrary perturbation via the response dielectric function @xmath24 .",
    "in general , the frequency @xmath41 which satisfies the dispersion relation @xmath25 is complex , i.e. , @xmath47 . however , in many cases @xmath48\\gg im[\\omega(k)]$ ] , and the plasma responds to the perturbation a long time after the initial disturbance with oscillations at a range of the well - defined frequencies .",
    "these are the normal modes of the plasma , in the sense that they are the nontransient response of the plasma to an initial perturbation",
    ". we can determine the normal modes of the plasma via the dispersion relation @xmath49=0 $ ] , which gives the frequency of the plasma waves as a function of the wave number @xmath50 or vice versa .",
    "it should be further mentioned that when we solve the vlasov and poisson s equations as an initial valve problem , here via @xmath51 , it is possible to obtain the solutions with negative or positive values of @xmath52 , corresponding to the damped or growing waves , respectively .",
    "this can be explicitly seen from the electrostatic potential associated with the wave number @xmath50 of the excitation as follows : @xmath53 where a solution with negative @xmath52 displays a damped wave , while the solution with positive one corresponds to an unstable mode .",

    "the physical description can be discussed in the context of the nonextensive statistics as follows . as mentioned earlier , the @xmath9-distribution function with @xmath81 , comparing with the maxwellian one ( @xmath133 ) , indicates the systems with more superthermal particles , i.e. , particles with the speed faster than the thermal speed @xmath88 ( superextensivity ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath9-distribution with @xmath77 is suitable to describe systems containing a large number of low - speed particles ( subextensivity ) .",
    "however , because of the long - range nature of coulombic interactions in plasma environments and the presence of many superthermal particles in such systems , confirmed by many astrophysical measurements @xcite , a @xmath9-distribution with @xmath81 is strongly suggested for the real plasma systems or superthermal plasmas .",
    "it is obvious that in a plasma with more superthermal particles ( @xmath81 ) , the phase velocity of the acoustic - like modes should be larger than the case with lack of superthemal particles ( @xmath77 ) , in agreement with our results here .",
    "in addition , we have illustrated the temperature - asymmetry effect , via @xmath129 , on the dispersion relation of acoustic modes in a pair plasma as shown in fig .",
    "2(b)[fig2 ] .",
    "there , the solid curve indicates the case in which the whole plasma is in a common thermal state with @xmath134 , signifies a temperature - symmetric pair plasma , and the other curves show deviations from this symmetric case .",
    "we see that the temperature - asymmetry reduces the phase velocity of the acoustic modes in a pair plasma .",
    "however , our kinetic model confirms that the acoustic - like modes are possible in both symmetric and asymmetric pair plasmas , depart from a small shift in phase velocity .",
    "it is reminded that in this work we have specialized our study to the low - frequency band in which @xmath92 .",
    "then , the cauchy principal value of eq .",
    "( [ dr ] ) is evaluated by an expanding in velocity in the form of eq .",
    "( [ expand ] ) .",
    "so , our calculations in this frequency band may lead to the acoustic modes and not to the langmuir waves . on the other hand , considering a high frequency band in which the phase velocity of the wave is much larger than the thermal velocity of the particles ( @xmath135 ) may lead to the langmuir - type waves , as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the dispersion relation for the langmuir waves is given by @xmath136 .",
    "\\label{omegr - lanqmuir}\\ ] ] however , for comparison of the acoustic modes and the langmuir waves in a pair plasma with @xmath137 , we have depicted both of the acoustic and langmuir branches in fig .",
    "3[fig3 ] . from this graph",
    ", we see explicitly that the acoustic waves belong to a low frequency band which tends to zero at the limit @xmath138 , while the langmuir waves occur at high frequencies above @xmath139",
    ".    on the other hand , the experimental data presented by oohara _ et . al _",
    "@xcite confirm the possibility of the acoustic - like modes in a pair plasma which is compatible with our results here .      in fig .",
    "4[fig4 ] we have plotted the ratio @xmath140 with respect to the nonextensivity index @xmath9 for all allowed values of @xmath81 ( referred to superextensivity ) at the limit of long wavelengths ( supported by , e.g. , @xmath141 ) .",
    "it is seen that both of the damped ( @xmath142 ) and growing ( @xmath143 ) acoustic - like modes are predicted in a nonextensive pair plasma with @xmath81 .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that in the @xmath9-region @xmath144 the acoustic modes are unstable , due to the fact that @xmath41 s have positive imaginary parts and then the associated modes will grow in time ( eq .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) is reminded ) .",
    "the mechanism which leads to this instability may explain as follows .",
    "as we expressed earlier , the @xmath9-nonextensive distribution with @xmath81 describes a system with a large number of superthermal particles .",
    "so , our solution for the vlasov and poisson s equations with small values of @xmath81 indicates an evolution which has started from a stationary state with a large portion of superthermal particles .",
    "the acoustic - like waves may gain energy from these superthermal particles and results in growing waves in time .",
    "in other words , this instability arises from a stationary state which describes a superthermal plasma and , in fact , we have obtained a solution for acoustic - like modes in which the stationary sate of the plasma has started from a non - equilibrium distribution .",
    "however , our results have the flexibility to reduce to the equilibrium solutions in the limiting case of @xmath0 indicates a maxwellian distribution .",
    "furthermore , the acoustic - like modes have landau damping in the @xmath9-region @xmath145 because @xmath41 s have negative imaginary parts in these degrees of the nonextensivity ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . the landau damping is a resonance phenomena between the plasma particles and the wave , for the particles moving with nearly the phase velocity of the wave @xcite . noting that the @xmath9-distribution is a decreasing function with @xmath62 , there are more particles moving slightly slower than the wave than the particles moving slightly faster than the wave ; if the slower particles are accelerated by the wave , this must reduce the energy of the wave , and the wave damps .",
    "it is to be noted that our analysis shows that after @xmath146 , the curve in fig .",
    "4 rises to positive values for a small interval of @xmath9 and then it returns to the negative values .",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath52 between the positive and negative values continues increasingly until to the limiting case at @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the curve in fig .",
    "4 do nt show a smooth behavior for the values @xmath147 and the analysis break down , until to the extensive limit at @xmath0 , where our solutions reduce smoothly to that of a maxwellian pair plasma given in eqs .",
    "( [ maxwellian0 ] ) and ( [ maxwellian ] ) .",
    "this unsmooth behaviour is because of the existence of the terms @xmath148 and @xmath149 in our formalism supported by @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , this behavior is a mathematical consequence and there is not a physical justification for it .",
    "so , we have analyzed the problem in a well - defined interval of @xmath9 , i.e , @xmath150 , as shown in fig .",
    "4 .    we can also investigate the resonance between the plasma particles and the acoustic modes for the values of @xmath77 ( referred to subextensivity ) . in fig .",
    "5[fig5 ] , the ratio @xmath140 with respect to nonextensivity index @xmath9 is plotted for the values of @xmath77 at a typical long wavelength ( @xmath141 ) . from this graph",
    ", it is seen that the acoustic - like modes have only ( landau ) damping and no growth for these degrees of the nonextensivity .",
    "furthermore , the damping rate is relatively weak in these @xmath9-regions , in comparison with the case of a superthermal plasma ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the reason is that the number of particles participating in the resonance with the wave is small for a stationary state with @xmath77 .",
    "strictly speaking , the slope of the velocity @xmath9-distribution function @xmath102 given in eq .",
    "( [ fq ] ) increases with @xmath9 and there is even a thermal cutoff in the case of @xmath77 [ see fig .",
    "this corresponds to a weaker resonance with the wave , in comparison with the case @xmath81 .",
    "our analysis reveals that the acoustic - like modes are unstable in the @xmath9-region @xmath144 ( high superthermal @xmath9-region ) yet , they are heavily damped in the @xmath9-region @xmath145 ( less superthermal @xmath9-region ) and finally , they are relatively weakly damped for the values of @xmath77 ( subextensive region ) . in fig .",
    "6[fig5 ] , the damping and growing rates with respect to the wave number are plotted for some values of the nonextensive index @xmath9 for three cases of the heavily damped modes [ fig6(a ) ] , weakly damped modes [ fig6(b ) ] and growing unstable modes [ fig6(c ) ] .",
    "we see that for the waves with longer wavelengths the rate of damping ( or growth ) becomes weaker .",
    "moreover , our numerical analysis shows that in a pair plasma the acoustic - like modes have the maximum damping at the vicinity of @xmath151 [ see fig6(a ) ] , and they have the maximum growth when the nonextensivity is at the vicinity of @xmath152 [ see fig6(c ) ] .",
    "in addition , we have included the maxwellian limit ( @xmath133 ) to the fig .",
    "6(b ) which emphasizes that the acoustic - like modes in an equilibrium pair plasma are merely landau damped waves .    for completing our discussion ,",
    "we have examined the temperature - asymmetry effect , controlled by @xmath129 , on the landau damping of the acoustic - like modes in a pair plasma , as plotted in fig .",
    "it is observed that the temperature - asymmetry in a pure pair plasma decreases the landau damping . in other words , for a fixed value of @xmath9 and at a given wavelength , the landau damping of the acoustic waves is maximum when a full symmetry in temperature of species is established , i.e , when @xmath134 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the acoustic - like modes in a collisionless and magnetic - field - free pair plasma on the basis of the nonextensive statistics .",
    "we have thereby used a kinetic theory model by employing the vlasov and poisson s equations to obtain the response dielectric function of the pair plasma for the electrostatic waves . by using the dielectric function ,",
    "we have investigated the acoustic - like modes whose phase speed lies between the thermal velocities of the species .",
    "the resultant dispersion relation in our study is compatible with the acoustic branch of the experimental data presented by oohara _ et .",
    "@xcite , in which the electrostatic waves have been examined in a pure pair - ion plasma . it has been shown that by decreasing the nonextensivity index @xmath9 the phase velocity of the acoustic modes increases , indicating to a plasma with a great deal of superthermal particles .",
    "our kinetic model confirms the possibility of the acoustic modes in the case of a temperature - asymmetric and also symmetric pair plasma .",
    "however , it is found that the temperature - asymmetry in a pair plasma reduces the phase velocity of the acoustic modes .",
    "furthermore , depending on the degree of nonextensivity of the plasma , both the damped and unstable acoustic modes are predicted in a collisionless pair plasma , arise from a resonance phenomena between the wave and nonthermal particles of the plasma . in the case of a superthemal plasma confirmed by @xmath81 ( superextensivity ) , the heavily damped and growing unstable modes are predicted , while in the case @xmath77 ( subextensivity ) the acoustic - like modes have only damping and no growth .",
    "the mechanism that leads to the damping is the same as presented by landau @xcite , arises from a decreasing velocity distribution function , but the mechanism of instability lies in the heart of the nonextensive formalism .",
    "we have postulated that the concerned instability can be associated with the presence of superthermal particles ( in the case @xmath81 ) , in the sense that in the process of the resonance they can give energy to the wave and then results in growing waves in time .",
    "this instability disappears in the case @xmath77 , describing a plasma with plenty of the low - speed particles .",
    "additionally , the damping rate is relatively weak in the case @xmath77 , in comparison with the case of a superthermal plasma ( @xmath153 ) with heavily damped modes .",
    "the reason is that the number of particles participating in the resonance with the wave is small for a stationary state with @xmath154 .",
    "moreover , our analysis indicates that the temperature - asymmetry in a pure pair plasma decreases the landau damping of the acoustic - like modes .",
    "we emphasize that in the present work , we have considered an inhomogeneous plasma in a nonequilibrium thermal state by considering the @xmath9-nonextensive distribution for stationary state of the plasma .",
    "however , our solutions reduce to the ones for a homogeneous and equilibrium pair plasma at the extensive limit @xmath0 , in which the boltzamnn - gibbs statistics describe the plasma state .",
    "it is hoped that the present study would be useful for explanation of the intriguing low - frequency modes in a pure pair plasma , which are out of the scope of the plasma fluid theory and the boltzmann - gibbs statistics .",
