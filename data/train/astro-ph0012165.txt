    "of paramount importance in determining the mechanism(s ) and epoch(s ) of galaxy formation ( as well as the local luminosity density ) , is the accurate and detailed quantification of the local galaxy population .",
    "it represents the benchmark against which both environmental and evolutionary effects can be measured .",
    "traditionally this research area originated with the all - sky photographic surveys coupled with a few handfuls of hard earned redshifts . over the past decade",
    "this has been augmented by both ccd - based imaging surveys and multi - slit / fibre - fed spectroscopic surveys . from these data ,",
    "a number of perplexing problems have arisen , most notably : the faint blue galaxy problem ( koo & kron 1992 ; ellis 1997 ) , the local normalisation problem ( maddox _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ; shanks 1990 ; driver , windhorst & griffiths 1995 ; marzke _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , the cosmological significance of low surface brightness galaxies ( disney 1976 ; mcgaugh 1996 ; sprayberry _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; dalcanton _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; impey & bothun 1997 ) and dwarf galaxies ( babul & rees 1992 ; phillipps & driver 1995 ; loveday 1997 ; babul & ferguson 1996 ) . these issues largely remain unresolved and arguably await an improved definition of the local galaxy population ( driver 1999 ) .",
    "recent advancements in technology now allow for wide field - of - view ccd imaging surveys ( dalcanton _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) as compared to the all sky coverage of photographic media ] and bulk redshift surveys through purpose built multi - fibre spectrographs such as the common - user two - degree field ( 2df ) facility at the anglo australian telescope ( taylor , cannon & parker 1998 ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey elegantly combines these two facets ( margon 1999 ) .",
    "the quantity and quality of data that is becoming available allows not only the revision of earlier results but more fundamentally the opportunity to review and enhance the methodology with which the local galaxy population is represented .",
    "for instance some criticism that might be levied at the current methodology  the representation of the space density of galaxies using the schechter luminosity function ( schechter 1976 ; felten 1985 ; binggeli , sandage & tammann 1988 )  is that firstly , it assumes that galaxies are single parameter systems defined by their apparent magnitude alone , and secondly it describes the entire galaxy population by only three parameters ; the characteristic luminosity @xmath15 , the normalisation of the characteristic luminosity @xmath16 , and the faint - end slope @xmath17 . while it is desirable to represent the population with the minimum number of parameters , important information may lie in the nuances of detail",
    ".    in particular , two recent areas of research suggest a greater diversity in the galaxy population than is allowed by the schechter function form .",
    "firstly , marzke _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) and also loveday ( 1997 ) report the indication of a change in the faint end slope at faint absolute magnitudes  a possible giant - dwarf transition  and this is also seen in a number of abell clusters where it is easier to probe into the dwarf regime ( e.g. , driver _",
    "_ 1994 ; de propris _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; driver , couch & phillipps 1998 ; trentham 1998 ) .",
    "secondly a number of studies show that the three schechter parameters , and in particular the faint - end slope , have a strong dependence upon : surface brightness limits ( sprayberry , impey & irwin 1996 ; dalcanton 1998 ) ; colour ( lilly _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) ; spectral type ( folkes _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) ; optical morphology ( marzke _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , environment ( phillipps _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and wavelength ( loveday 2000 ) .",
    "it has been noted ( willmer 1997 ) that the choice of method for reconstructing the galaxy lf also contains some degree of bias .",
    "more fundamentally , evidence that the current methodology might actually be flawed comes from comparing recent measurements of the galaxy luminosity function as shown in fig .",
    "the discrepancy between these surveys is significantly adrift from the quoted formal errors implying an unknown systematic error .",
    "the range of discrepancy can be quantified as a factor of 2 at the @xmath15 ( @xmath18 ) point rising to a factor of 10 at @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the impact of this variation is a factor of 3 - 4 , for instance , in assessing the contribution of galaxies to the local baryon budget ( e.g. persic & salucci 1992 ; bristow & phillipps 1994 ; and fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "this uncertainty is in addition to that introduced from the unanswered question of the space density of low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "the most recent attempt to quantify this is by oneil & bothun ( 2000 )  following on from mcgaugh ( 1996 ) , and in turn disney ( 1976 )  who conclude that the surface brightness function ( sbf ) of galaxies  the number density of galaxies in intervals of surface brightness  is of similar form to the luminosity function .",
    "thus both the lf and sbf are described by a flat distribution with a cutoff at bright absolute magnitudes or high surface brightnesses . taking the oneil result at face value ,",
    "this implies a further error in measures of the local luminosity density of 2 - 3 - i.e. the contribution to the luminosity- ( and hence baryon- ) density from galaxies is uncertain to a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "however the significance of low surface brightness galaxies depends upon their luminosity range and similarly the completeness of the lf relies on the surface brightness intervals over which each luminosity bin is valid .",
    "both representations are incomplete unless the information is combined .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that both the total flux and the manner in which this flux is distributed must be dealt with simultaneously .",
    "several papers have been published which deal with either surface brightness distributions or bivariate brightness distributions ( phillipps & disney 1986 , boyce & phillipps 1994 , minchin 1999 , sodre & lahav 1993 , and petrosian 1998 ) .",
    "these are either theoretical , limited to cluster environments or have poor statistics due to the scarcity of good redshift data .",
    "recently , driver ( 1999 ) determined the first measure of the _ bivariate brightness distribution _ for field galaxies using hubble deep field data ( williams _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) and capitalising on photometric redshifts ( fernndez - soto _ et al .",
    "the result , based on a volume limited sample of 47 galaxies , implied that giant low surface brightness galaxies were rare but that there exists a strong luminosity - surface brightness relationship , similar to that seen in virgo ( binggeli 1993 ) .",
    "the sense of the relationship implied that low surface brightness galaxies are preferentially of lower luminosity ( i.e. dwarfs ) .",
    "if this is borne out it strongly tempers the conclusions of oneil & bothun ( 2000 ) . while the number of low surface brightness galaxies may be large ,",
    "their luminosities are low , so their contribution to the local luminosity density , is also low , @xmath22% ( driver 1999 ) .",
    "this paper attempts to bundle these complex issues onto a more intuitive platform by expanding the current representation of the local galaxy population to allow for : surface brightness detection effects , star - galaxy separation issues , surface brightness photometric corrections and clustering effects .",
    "this is achieved by expanding the mono - variate luminosity function into a bivariate brightness distribution ( bbd ) where the additional dimension is surface brightness .",
    "the 2dfgrs allows us to do this for the first time by having a large enough database to separate galaxies in both magnitude and surface brightness without having too many problems with small number statistics .    in  2",
    "we discuss the revised methodology for measuring the space density of the local galaxy population , the local luminosity density and the contribution towards the baryon density in detail . in ",
    "3 we present the current 2dfgrs data ( containing @xmath23 galaxies or one fifth of the expected final tally ) . in ",
    "4 we correct for the light lost under the isophote and define our surface brightness measure . in ",
    "5 we apply the methodology to construct the first statistically significant bivariate brightness distribution for field galaxies . the results for the number - density and luminosity - density are detailed in  6 and  7 . in  8 , we compare these results to other surveys",
    ". finally we present our conclusions .    throughout",
    "we adopt @xmath24kms@xmath25mpc@xmath25 and a standard flat cosmology with zero cosmological constant ( _ i.e. _ @xmath26 ) .",
    "however we note that the results presented here are only weakly dependent on the cosmology .",
    "the luminosity density , @xmath27 , is the total amount of flux emitted by all galaxies per mpc@xmath28 .",
    "when measured in the uv band it can be converted to a measure of the star - formation rate ( see for example lilly _",
    "_ 1996 , madau _ et al .",
    "when measured at longer wavelengths it can be combined with mass - to - light ratios to yield an _ approximate _",
    "value for the contribution from galaxies towards the local matter density @xmath29  independent of @xmath30 , only weakly cosmology dependent and not reliant on any specific theory of structure formation ( see for example carlberg _",
    "_ 1996 ; fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "the two main caveats are firstly the accuracy of @xmath0 ( the luminosity density measured in the b - band ) , and secondly the assumption of a ubiquitous mass - to - light ratio .      the luminosity density , @xmath27 , is found by integrating the product of the number density @xmath31 and the luminosity l with respect to luminosity .",
    "@xmath32 by convention , @xmath27 is typically derived from a magnitude - limited redshift survey by determining the representative schechter parameters for a survey ( e.g. efstathiou _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) and then integrating the luminosity weighted schechter function , where @xmath33 is the schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) given by :",
    "@xmath34}\\,d(l / l_{*})\\ ] ] and @xmath35 and @xmath17 are the three parameters which define the survey ( referred to as the normalisation point , characteristic turn - over luminosity and faint - end slope parameter respectively ) .",
    "more simply if a survey is defined by these three parameters it follows that : @xmath36    table 1 shows values for the luminosity density derived from a number of recent magnitude - limited redshift surveys ( as indicated ) .",
    "the variation between the measurements of @xmath27 from these surveys is @xmath37 and hence the uncertainty in the galaxy contribution to the mass budget is at best equally uncertain",
    ". this could be due to a number of factors , e.g. , large scale - structure , selection biases , redshift errors , photometric errors or other incompleteness .",
    "in this paper we wish to explore the possibility of selection bias due to surface brightness considerations only .",
    "the principal motivation for this is that the lcrs ( lower line on fig .",
    "1 ) , which recovers the lowest @xmath27 value , adopted a bright isophotal detection limit of @xmath38 mag arcsec@xmath5 , suggesting a dependence between the measured @xmath27 and the surface brightness limit of the survey . here",
    "we develop a method for calculating @xmath27 which incorporates a number of corrections / considerations for surface brightness selection biases .",
    "in particular , a surface brightness dependent malmquist correction , a surface brightness redshift completeness correction and an isophotal magnitude correction .",
    "we also correct for clustering .",
    "what is not included here , and will be pursued in a later paper , is the photometric accuracy , star - galaxy separation accuracy and a detection correction specifically for the two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) .",
    "implementing these corrections requires re - formalising the path to @xmath27 .",
    "firstly , we replace the luminosity function representation of the local galaxy population by a _ bivariate brightness distribution _ ( bbd ) .",
    "the bivariate brightness distribution is the galaxy number density , @xmath39 , as a function of absolute , total , b - band magnitude , @xmath40 , and absolute , effective surface brightness , @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath42 . to construct a bbd we need to convert the observed distribution to a number density distribution taking into account the malmquist bias and the redshift incompleteness correction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath43 where :    * @xmath44 is the matrix of absolute magnitude , @xmath45 , and absolute effective surface brightness , @xmath46 , for galaxies with redshifts .",
    "* @xmath47 is the matrix of absolute magnitude , @xmath45 , and absolute effective surface brightness , @xmath46 , for those galaxies for which redshifts were not obtained .",
    "* @xmath48 is the matrix which specifies the volume over which a galaxy with absolute magnitude , @xmath45 , and absolute effective surface brightness , @xmath46 , can be seen ( see also phillipps , davies & disney 1990 ) . *",
    "@xmath49 is the matrix that weights each bin to compensate for clustering .    deriving these matrices",
    "is discussed in detail later .",
    "@xmath27 is then defined as : @xmath50 or in practice , @xmath51 in units of @xmath52mpc@xmath10 where @xmath53 .",
    "our formalism has two key advantages over the traditional luminosity function : firstly , it adds the additional dimensionality of surface brightness allowing for surface brightness specific corrections .",
    "secondly , it represents the galaxy population by a distribution rather than a function , thus requiring no fitting procedures or assumption of any underlying parametric form .",
    "the data set presented here is based upon a sub - sample of the automated plate measuring - machine galaxy catalogue ( apm ; maddox et al .",
    "1990a , b ) for which spectra have been obtained using the two - degree field facility ( 2df ) at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the original apm catalogue contains @xmath54 magnitudes with random error @xmath55 mag ( folkes et al .",
    "1999 ) and isophotal areas @xmath56 .",
    "the isophotal area is defined as the number of pixels above a limiting isophote , @xmath57  set at the @xmath58 level above the sky background ( @xmath59 mag arcsec@xmath5 with a variation of @xmath60 mag arcsec@xmath5 - pimbblet et al .",
    ". however apm @xmath54 magnitudes are found to vary from ccd @xmath54 magnitudes by @xmath61mag ( metcalfe et al .",
    "therefore the isophotal limit in apm @xmath54 magnitudes is @xmath62mag arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "one pixel equals 0.25 @xmath63 .",
    "the minimum isophotal area found for galaxies in the apm catalogue is 35@xmath63 .",
    "star - galaxy separation was implemented as described in maddox _",
    "( 1990b ) .",
    "the final apm sample contains @xmath64 galaxies covering 15,000 square degrees ",
    "see maddox _",
    "( 1990a , b ) for further details .",
    "the 2dfgrs input catalogue is a 2000 @xmath65 subregion of the apm catalogue ( covering two continuous regions in the northern and southern galactic caps plus random fields ) with an extinction corrected magnitude limit of @xmath66 ( colless 1999 ) .",
    "the input catalogue contains 250,000 galaxies for which 81,895 have been observed using 2df ( as of november 1999 ) .",
    "each spectrum within the database has been examined by eye to check if the redshift is reliable .",
    "redshifts are determined via cross - correlation with specified templates ( see folkes _",
    "_ 1999 for details ) .",
    "a brief test of the reliability of the 2dfgrs was achieved via a comparison between 1404 galaxies in common with the las campanas redshift survey ( lin _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) for which there were only 8 mismatches , showing that 2df redshifts are reliable .",
    "of the 81,895 galaxies , 74,562 have a redshift , resulting in a redshift completeness of 91% .",
    "the survey comprises many overlapping two degree fields and many still have to be observed .",
    "hence the absolute normalisation is tied to the full input galaxy catalogue which is known to contain 174.0 galaxies with @xmath67 per square degree . using a subsample of 44796 galaxies , covering just the south galactic pole ( sgp ) region ,",
    "this yields an _ effective _ coverage for this survey of 257 non - contiguous square degrees .",
    "finally , for the purposes of this paper , we adopt a lower redshift limit of @xmath68 to minimise the influence of peculiar velocities in the determination of absolute parameters and an upper redshift limit of @xmath69 .",
    "this upper limit of @xmath70 was selected so as to maximise the sample size yet minimise the error introduced by the isophotal corrections . at @xmath70 the uncertainty in the isophotal correction ( @xmath71 ) , due to type uncertainty",
    "( see appendix a ) , remains smaller than the photometric error ( @xmath72 mags ) .",
    "note that the increase in the error in the isophotal correction is primarily because of the increase in the _ intrinsic _ isophotal limit due to a combination of surface brightness - dimming and the k - correction .",
    "the final sample is therefore pseudo _ volume_-limited and contains 20,765 galaxies , with redshifts , selected from a parent sample of 45,000 .",
    "note : all magnitude and surface brightnesses are in the apm @xmath73 filter .",
    "the apm magnitudes have already been corrected assuming a gaussian profile ( see maddox _ et al . _",
    "1990b for full details ) .",
    "this was aimed primarily at recovering the light lost due to the seeing and is crucial for compact objects . it is known to significantly underestimate the isophotal correction required for low surface brightness disks .",
    "such systems typically exhibit exponential profiles with disks which can extend a substantial distance beyond the isophote , the most famous example being malin 1 ( bothun _ et al .",
    "once thought of as a virgo dwarf this system remains the most luminous field galaxy known .    to compliment the gaussian correction ( required for compact objects but ineffectual for extended sources ) we introduce an additional correction ( ineffectual for compact sources but suitable for extended disks ) .",
    "this correction assumes all objects can be represented by a pure exponential surface brightness profile extending from the core outwards . in this case",
    "the surface brightness profile is simply : @xmath74 or , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the central surface brightness in wm@xmath5 arcsec@xmath5 , @xmath17 is the scale length of the galaxy in arcsecs and r the radius in arcsecs .",
    "@xmath77 is the central surface brightness in mag arcsec@xmath5 .    under this assumption",

    "the total magnitude is then given by : @xmath85 or , @xmath86    from this description an extrapolated central surface brightness can be deduced numerically from the specified isophotal area and isophotal magnitude ( after the seeing correction ) .",
    "note that this prescription ignores the possible presence of a bulge , opacity , and inclination leading to an underestimate of the isophotal correction .",
    "this is unavoidable as the data quality is insufficient to establish bulge - to - disk ratios . to verify the impact of this we explore the accuracy of the isophotal correction for a variety of galaxy types in appendix a.",
    "the tests show that the isophotal correction is a significant improvement over the isophotal magnitudes for all types - apart for ellipticals where the introduced error is negligible compared to the photometric error - and a dramatic improvement for low surface brightness systems .",
    "the final magnitudes , after isophotal correction , now lie well within the quoted error of @xmath72 mags for both high- and low - surface brightness galaxies .",
    "most results cited in the literature use the central surface brightness or the effective surface brightness .",
    "the central surface brightness , as described above , is the extrapolated surface brightness at the core under the assumption of a perfect exponential disk .",

    "we chose to work with effective surface brightness as it can , at some later stage , be measured directly from higher quality ccd data .",
    "note that these surface brightness measures are all _ apparent _ rather than _ intrinsic _ , however this is not important as although surface brightness is distance dependent the isophotal correction is not ( this is because both @xmath82 and @xmath90 vary with redshift in the same way ) .",

    "the galaxies are plotted according to their apparent total magnitude and apparent effective surface brightness .",
    "the curved boundary at the faint end of both plots is due to the isophotal corrections which are strongly dependent on @xmath41 for a constant @xmath91 .",
    "as @xmath92 tends towards @xmath82 , the isophotal limit , the correction tends towards infinity , making it impossible to see galaxies close to @xmath82 .",
    "the average isophotal correction is @xmath93 mag ( for @xmath94 mag arcsec@xmath5 ) .",

    "these figures imply that galaxies closer to the detection limits are preferentially under - sampled .",
    "we now apply the methodology described in section 2 to derive the bbd from our data set .",

    "not all galaxies targeted by the 2dfgrs have a measured redshift .",

    "one method to correct for these missing galaxies is to assume that they have the same observed bbd as those galaxies for which redshifts have been obtained .",
    "one can then simply scale up all bins by this known incompleteness .    however , from fig . 2 and",

    "i.e. , _ @xmath48 .",
    "this matrix reflects the volumes over which each @xmath45 , @xmath46 bin can be observed .",
    "one option is to use visibility theory as prescribed by phillipps , davies & disney ( 1990 ) - and used to construct the constant volume line on fig .",
    "while visibility is clearly a step in the right direction , and preferable to applying a magnitude - only dependent correction , its limitation is that it assumes idealised galaxy profiles ( _ i.e. _ it neglects the bulge component , seeing , star - galaxy separation and other complications ) .",
    "ideally one would like to extract the volume information from the data itself and this is possible by using a @xmath136 type prescription , _",
    "i.e. _ , within each @xmath44 bin , the maximum redshift at which a galaxy is seen is determined and the volume derived from this redshift .",
    "the advantages of using the data set rather than theory is that it naturally incorporates all redshift dependent selection biases .",
    "however the maximum redshift is susceptible to scattering from higher - visibility bins .",
    "an improved version is therefore to use the @xmath137 percentile redshift and to adjust @xmath44 and @xmath47 accordingly .",
    "although this requires rejecting 10% of the data it has two distinct advantages .",
    "firstly it ensures that the redshift distribution in each bin has a sharp cutoff ( as opposed to a distribution which peters out ) .",
    "secondly it uses the entire dataset as opposed to the maximum redshift only . in the case where the @xmath137 percentile is not exact",
    "we take the galaxy nearest . using these redshifts",
    "the volume can be calculated independently for each bin assuming an einstein - de sitter cosmology as follows :    @xmath138    where ,    @xmath139    and @xmath140 is the solid angle in steradians on the sky .",
    "@xmath141 is the luminosity distance to the galaxy .",
    "@xmath142 is the minimum distance over which a galaxy can be detected .",
    "@xmath142 is calculated from visibility theory ( phillipps , davies & disney 1990 , see also appendix b ) adopting values for the maximum magnitude and maximum size of @xmath143 mag and @xmath144 respectively .",
    "8 shows the matrix @xmath145 .",
    "note that squares containing fewer than 25 galaxies are not shaded .",
    "this matrix is flat - bottomed due to the cutoff at @xmath70 .",
    "8 shows a strong dependency upon magnitude ( i.e. classical malmquist bias as expected ) and also upon surface brightness .",
    "this surface brightness dependency is particularly strong near the @xmath146 mpc@xmath28 volume limit , as the data becomes sparse . inside this volume limit",
    "the contour lines generally mimic the curve of the visibility - derived volume boundary .",
    "this suggests that visibility theory provides a good description of the combined volume dependency .",
    "the sharp cutoff along the high surface brightness edge may be real but could also be a manifestation of the complex star - galaxy separation algorithm ( see maddox 1990a ) .",
    "given that a galaxy seen over a larger distance appears more compact and that local dwarfs have smaller scale lengths than giants ( cf .",
    "mateo 1998 ) , this seems reasonable .",
    "we will investigate this further through high - resolution imaging .    the main point to take away from fig .",
    "8 is that the visibility surface of the 2dfgrs input catalogue is complex and dependent on both @xmath45 and @xmath41 ( although predominantly @xmath45 ) .",
    "any methodology which ignores surface brightness information and implements a volume - bias correction in luminosity only , is implicitly assuming uniform visibility in surface brightness .",
    "the 2dfgrs data clearly show that this is not the case .",
    "structure is seen on the largest measurable scales ( e.g. de lapparent , gellar & huchra 1986 ) . to determine whether the effects of clustering are significant we constructed a radial density profile , as shown in fig .",
    "this was derived from those bins for which more than 100 galaxies are seen over the whole range from @xmath147 ( i.e. @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) .",
    "those galaxies which are brighter can not be seen at @xmath150 due to the bright magnitude cut at @xmath151 and would therefore bias the number density towards the bright end . for these high - visibility galaxies we calculated their number - density ( @xmath152 ) in equal volume intervals of @xmath153 mpc@xmath28 , from @xmath154 to @xmath70 . fig .",
    "9 shows that clustering is severe with what appears to be a large local void around @xmath155 and walls at @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "the eso slice project ( esp ) survey ( zucca et al . 1997 ) whose line - of - sight ( ra @xmath158h , @xmath159 ) is just outside the 2df sgp region , measures an under - density at @xmath160mpc ( @xmath161 ) and an over - density at @xmath162 .",
    "the structure that they see closely resembles the structure that we see .",
    "a reliable measure of the bbd needs to correct for this clustering - bias .",
    "here we adopt a strategy which implicitly assumes , firstly , that clustering is independent of either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , and secondly , that evolutionary processes to z = 0.12 are negligible .",
    "on the basis of these caveats we constructed a weighting matrix , @xmath49 .",
    "this was determined from the high - visibility galaxies by taking the ratio of the number - density of high - visibility galaxies over the full redshift range divided by the number - density of high - visibility galaxies over the redshift range of each bin , i.e. :    @xmath163    this weighting matrix is shown in fig .",
    "the implication is that the number - density of low - luminosity systems will be amplified by almost a factor of 1.5 , to correct for the apparent presence of a large local void along the sgp region - indicated by the vertical ridge at @xmath164 on fig .",
    "once again this implicitly assumes that the clustering of dwarf and giant systems is correlated .",
    "finally we can combine the four matrices , @xmath44 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see eqn  [ eq : phim ] ) , to generate the 2dfgrs bivariate brightness distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "this depicts the underlying local galaxy number - density distribution inclusive of surface brightness selection effects .",
    "only those bins which are based upon 25 or more galaxies are shown .",
    "note that by summing the bbd along the surface brightness axis one recovers the luminosity distribution of galaxies . by summing along the magnitude axis one obtains the surface brightness distribution of galaxies ( see  8) .",
    "12 shows the errors in the bbd .",
    "these were initially determined via monte - carlo simulations , assuming a gaussian error distribution of @xmath72 mag , in the apm magnitudes .",
    "this showed that the errors were proportional to @xmath165 , and since @xmath165 is much faster to calculate , this is the result that is used throughout the calculations .",
    "these errors were then combined in quadrature with the additional error in the volume estimate , assuming poisson statistics .",
    "the total error is given by :    @xmath166    the errors become significant ( @xmath167 20% ) , when @xmath168 and around the boundaries of the bbd shown in fig .",
    "the data and associated errors are tabulated in table 2 . from figs 11",
    "& 12 we note the following :      the bbd shows evidence of a luminosity - surface brightness relation similar to that seen in virgo , ( @xmath169 , binggeli 1993 ) , in the hubble deep field , ( @xmath170 , driver 1999 ) and in sdm galaxies ( @xmath171 de jong & lacey 2000 ) .",
    "a formal fit to the 2dfgrs data yields @xmath172 .",
    "while confirming the general trend this result appears significantly steeper than the virgo and hdf results .",
    "both the virgo and hdf results are based on lower luminosity systems hence this might be indicative of a second order dependency of the relation upon luminosity",
    ". alternatively it may reflect slight differences in the data / analysis as neither the virgo nor hdf data include isophotal corrections whereas the 2dfgrs data is more susceptible to atmospheric seeing .",
    "the gradient is slightly steeper than the de jong & lacey result , but is well within the errors .",
    "the presence of a luminosity - surface brightness relation highlights concerns over the completeness of galaxy surveys , as surveys with bright isophotal limits will preferentially exclude dwarf systems leading to an underestimate of their space - densities and variations such as those seen in fig . 1 .",
    "the confirmation of this luminosity - surface brightness relation within such an extensive dataset is an important step forward and any credible model of galaxy formation must now be required to reproduce this relation .      within each magnitude interval",
    "there appears to be a preferred range in surface brightness over which galaxies may exist .",
    "while the high - surface brightness limit _ may _ be due , in part or whole , to star - galaxy separation and/or fibre - positioning accuracy the low surface brightness limit appears real .",
    "this can not be a selection limit as one requires a mechanism which hides luminous lsbgs yet allows dwarf galaxies of similar surface brightness to be detected within the same volume .",
    "the implications are that these galaxy types ( luminous - lsbgs ) are rare with densities less than @xmath173 galaxies mpc@xmath10 .",
    "this result is important as it directly addresses the issues raised in the introduction and implies that existing surveys have _ not _ missed large populations of luminous low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "perhaps more importantly it confirms that the 2dfgrs is complete for giant galaxies and that the postulate that the universe might be dominated by luminous lsbgs ( disney 1976 ) is ruled out .",
    "one caveat however is that luminous - lsbgs could be masquerading as dwarfs .",
    "for example consider the case of malin 1 ( bothun _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) which has a huge extended disk ( @xmath174 kpc scale - length ) of very low surface brightness ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "this system is actually readily detectable because of its high surface brightness active core , however within the 2dfgrs limits it would have been miss - classified as a dwarf system with @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "hence figs 11 & 12 rule out luminous disk systems only . to determine whether objects such as malin 1 are hidden amongst the dwarf population will require either ultra - deep ccd imaging or cross - correlation with hi - surveys which would exhibit very high hi mass - to - light ratios for such systems .",
    "the galaxy population shows a steady increase in number - density with decreasing luminosity .",
    "this continues to the survey limits at @xmath178 , whereupon the volume limit and surface brightness selection effects impinge upon our sample .",
    "the expectation is that the distribution continues to rise and hence the location of the peak in the number - density distribution remains unknown .",
    "however we do note that the increase seen within our selection limits is insufficient for the dwarf population to dominate the luminosity - density as shown in the next section .",
    "perhaps more surprising is the lack of sub - structure indicating either a continuity between the giant and dwarf populations or that any sub - structure is erased by the random errors .",
    "the former case is strongly indicative of a hierarchical merger scenario for galaxy formation which one expects to lead towards a smooth number - density distribution between the dwarf and giant systems ( white & rees , 1978 ) .",
    "this is contrary to the change in the luminosity distribution of galaxies seen in cluster environments ( e.g. smith , driver , & phillipps 1997 ) . in a later paper",
    "we intend to explore the dependency of the bbd upon environment .",
    "the luminosity density matrix , @xmath179 is constructed from @xmath180 in units of @xmath52mpc@xmath10 and is shown as fig . 13 .",
    "the distribution is strongly peaked close to the conventional @xmath124 parameter derived in previous surveys ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the peak lies at @xmath181 mag and @xmath182 mag arcsec@xmath5 .",
    "the final value obtained is @xmath183mpc@xmath10 .",
    "the sharp peak sits firmly in the centre of our observable region of the 2dfgrs bbd and drops rapidly off on all sides towards the 2dfgrs bbd boundaries .",
    "this implies that while the 2dfgrs does not survey the entire parameter space of the known bbd it does effectively contain the full galaxy contribution to the local luminosity density . redoing the calculations using galaxies with redshifts",
    "also results in @xmath184mpc@xmath10 .",
    "this demonstrates that there is no dependency of the results upon the assumption made for the distribution of galaxies without redshifts .",
    "we note that @xmath27 derived via a direct @xmath185 estimate , without any surface brightness or clustering corrections , ( eqn  [ eq : j ] ) gives a value of @xmath186mpc@xmath10 . including the isophotal magnitude correction only leads to a value of @xmath187mpc@xmath10 .",
    "hence a more detailed analysis leads to a 36.8% increase in @xmath27 , of this 36.8% , 25.3% is due to the isophotal correction , 10.4% is due to the malmquist bias correction and 1.1% is due to the clustering correction .",
    "the final value agrees well with that obtained from the recent eso slice project ( zucca _ et al .",
    "the method that they used corrects for clustering , but not surface brightness  although their photometry is based on aperture rather than isophotal magnitudes .",
    "however it is worth pointing out that @xmath27 is sensitive to the exact value of @xmath82 .",
    "the quoted error in @xmath82 is @xmath188 ( for plate - to - plate variations , metcalfe et al 1995 ; pimblett et al 2000 ) .",
    "table 3 shows a summary of results when repeating the entire analysis using the upper and lower error limits .",
    "it therefore seems likely that a _ combination _ of surface brightness biases and large scale structure can indeed lead to the type of variations seen in table 1 .    finally following the method of carlberg , yee & ellingson ( 1997 ) we can obtain a crude ball - park figure for the total local mass density by adopting a universal mass - to - light ratio based on that observed in clusters . while this method neglects biasing ( white , tully & davis , 1988 ) it does provide a useful crude _ upper _ limit to the mass density . from carlberg _",
    "( 1997 ) we find : @xmath189 . assuming a mean colour of @xmath190 and a solar colour index of 1.17 this converts to : @xmath191 .",
    "multiplying the luminosity density by the mass - to - light ratio yields a value for the local mass - density of @xmath192 .",
    "we note that this is consistent with the current constraints from the combination of sn ia results with the recent boomerang and maxima-1 results ( balbi _ et al . _ 2000 ; de bernardis _ et al .",
    "as this work represents the first detailed measure of the field bbd there is no previous work with which to compare .",
    "however as mentioned earlier it is trivial to convert the bbd into either a luminosity distribution and/or a surface brightness distribution both of which have been determined by numerous groups .",
    "this is achieved by summing across either luminosity or surface brightness intervals . for those bins containing fewer than 25 galaxies",
    "for which a volume- and clustering- bias correction were not obtained we use the volume - bias correction from the nearest bin with 25 or more galaxies .",
    "this will lead to a slight underestimate in the number - densities , however as the number - density peak is well defined this effect is negligible .",
    "14 shows a compendium of luminosity function measures ( see table 1 and fig .",
    "1 ) . superimposed on the previous schechter function",
    "fits ( dotted lines ) are the results from the 2dfgrs .",
    "three results are shown , the luminosity distribution neglecting surface brightness and clustering ( short dashed line ) , the luminosity distribution inclusive of surface brightness corrections ( long dashed line ) and finally the luminosity distribution inclusive of surface brightness and clustering corrections ( solid line ) . the inset shows the @xmath193 error eclipse for the latter case , yielding schechter function parameters of @xmath194 and @xmath195 in close agreement with the eso slice project ( esp , see table 1 ) .    comparing",
    "the 2dfgrs result with other surveys suggests that the main effect of the surface brightness correction is to shift @xmath124 brightwards by the mean isophotal correction of 0.33 mag and to increase the number density by a factor of 1.2 .",
    "the clustering correction has little effect at bright magnitudes , almost by definition , but significantly amplifies the dwarf population .",
    "this is a direct consequence of an apparent local void at z=0.04 along the full range of the 2df sgp region .",
    "we note that the combination of these two corrections mimics closely the discrepancies between various schechter function fits .",
    "for example the shallower ssrs2 , apm and durham / ukst surveys are biased at all magnitudes by the apparent local void while the deeper esp and autofib surveys ( which employ clustering independent methods ) probe beyond the void .",
    "similarly because of the luminosity - surface brightness relation those surveys which probe to lower surface brightnesses will find a higher dwarf - to - giant ratio .",
    "the shaded region shows the point at which our data starts to become highly uncertain because of the small volume surveyed ( @xmath196 mpc@xmath28 ) .",
    "as this is the first statistically significant investigation into the bivariate brightness distribution we can conclude that as yet no survey contains any direct census of the space density of @xmath197 mag galaxies .",
    "_      there have been a few surface brightness functions published over the years .",
    "the first was the freeman ( 1970 ) result , which showed a gaussian distribution with @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "since then , however , many galaxies have been found at greater than 10@xmath140 from the mean .",
    "the probability of a galaxy occurring at 10@xmath140 or greater is @xmath200 .",
    "the total number of galaxies in the universe is in the range of @xmath201  @xmath202 , so the freeman sbf must be underestimating the lsbgs .",
    "the distribution seen by freeman is almost certainly due to the relatively bright isophotal detection threshold that the observations were taken at , around 22 - 23 mag arcsec@xmath5 . a more recent measure of the sbf comes from oneil & bothun ( 2000 ) who also show a compendium of results from other groups .",
    "the oneil & bothun data in contrast to the freeman result shows a flat distribution over the range @xmath203 albeit with substantial scatter .",
    "15 reproduces fig . 1 . of oneil & bothun but now includes the final 2dfgrs results .",
    "in order to compare our results directly with the oneil & bothun data we assumed a mean bulge - to - total ratio of 0.4 ( see kent 1985 ) resulting in a uniform offset of @xmath204 mag arcsec@xmath5 .    the 2dfgrs data is substantially broader than the freeman distribution and appears to agree well with the compendium of data summarised in oneil & bothun ( 2000 ) . from visibility theory (",
    "3 ) we are complete ( _ i.e. _ the volume observed is greater than @xmath146 mpc@xmath28 and therefore statistically representative ) in central surface brightness from @xmath205 for @xmath206 . assuming that the luminosity - surface brightness relation continues as reported in driver ( 1999 ) and driver & cross ( 2000 ) the expectation is that the surface brightness distribution will steepen as galaxies with lower luminosities are included",
    "we have introduced the bivariate brightness distribution as a means by which the effect of surface brightness selection biases in large galaxy catalogues can be investigated . by correcting for the light below the isophote and including a surface brightness dependent malmquist correction we find that the measurement of the luminosity density is increased by @xmath14% over the traditional @xmath185 method of evaluation .",
    "the majority ( 25% ) of this increase comes from the isophotal correction with 10% due to incorporating a surface brightness dependent malmquist correction and 1% due to the clustering correction .",
    "we have shown that our isophotal correction is suitable for all galaxy types and that isophotal magnitudes without correction severely underestimate the magnitudes for specific galaxy types .",
    "we also note that the redshift incompleteness suggests that predominantly low surface brightness galaxies are being missed however we also show that these systems are predominantly low luminosity and hence contribute little to the overall luminosity density .",
    "this is in part due to the high completeness of the 2dfgrs ( @xmath207 % ) .",
    "we rule out the possibility of the 2dfgrs missing a significant population of luminous giant galaxies down to @xmath208 mag arcsec@xmath5 ( or @xmath209 mag arcsec@xmath5 ) and note that the contribution at surface brightness limits below @xmath210 mag arcsec@xmath5 is small and declining .",
    "dwarf galaxies greatly outnumber the giants and the peak in the number density occurs at the low luminosity selection boundary .",
    "the implication is that the most numerous galaxy type lies at @xmath211 mag . the galaxy population as a whole follows a luminosity - surface brightness relation ( @xmath212 ) , similar but slightly steeper , to that seen in virgo , in the hubble deep field and in sdm galaxies .",
    "this relation provides an additional constraint which galaxy formation models must satisfy .",
    "we conclude that our measure of the galaxy contribution to the luminosity density is robust and dominated by conventional giant galaxies with only a small ( @xmath213% ) contribution from dwarf ( @xmath214 mag ) and/or low surface brightness giants ( @xmath215 mag arcsec@xmath5 ) within the selection boundaries(@xmath216 mag , @xmath4 mag arcsec@xmath5 ) .",
    "however we can not rule out the possibility of a contribution from an independent population outside of our optical selection boundaries .",
    "our measurement of the luminosity density is @xmath217l@xmath9mpc@xmath10 and using a typical cluster mass - to - light ratio leads to an estimate of the matter density of order @xmath218 in agreement with more robust measures .",
    "finally we note that the bivariate brightness distribution offers a means of studying the galaxy population and luminosity - density as a function of environment and epoch fully inclusive of surface brightness selection biases .",
    "future extensions to this work will include the measurement of bbds and `` population peaks '' for individual spectral / morphological types , and as a function of redshift and environment .",
    "this step forward has only become possible because of the recent availability of large redshift survey databases such as that provided by the 2dfgrs .",
    "the data shown here was obtained via the two - degree field facility on the 3.9 m anglo - australian observatory .",
