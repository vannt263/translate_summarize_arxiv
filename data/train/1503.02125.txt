    "<S> in this work , inspired by the observation of charmoniumlike @xmath0 , we study the photoproduction of charged charmoniumlike @xmath0 with an effective lagrangian approach and the regge trajectories model . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results indicate that the reggeized treatment can lead to a lower total cross section of the @xmath0 photoproduction and the peak position of cross section was moved to the higher energy point when the reggeized treatment was added . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , using the data from the compass experiment and presented theoretical predictions , an upper limit of the decay width of @xmath1 is estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant results not only shed light on the further experiment of searching for the charmoniumlike @xmath2 state via meson photoproduction , but also provide valuable informations for having a better comprehension of the nature of charmoniumlike @xmath2 state . </S>"
