    "theoretical investigation of hadron production in heavy - ion collisions at high energies is usually separated into different camps , characterized by the regions of transverse momenta @xmath0 of the produced hadrons . at low @xmath0 statistical hadronization and hydrodynamical models",
    "are generally used @xcite , whereas at high @xmath0 jet production and parton fragmentation with suitable consideration of medium effects in perturbative qcd are the central themes @xcite .",
    "the two approaches have been studied essentially independent of each other with credible success in interpreting the data , since their dynamics are decoupled at the energies investigated .",
    "the situation may have changed at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , where pb - pb collisions have been carried out at @xmath1 tev , resulting in thousands of soft hadrons on the one hand , and multiple hard jets on the other .",
    "minijets that are copiously produced at intermediate @xmath0 can fragment into soft partons with multiplicities so high that their effects on the hadronization of all partons created in the soft sector can not be ignored .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to investigate what those effects are and to offer an explanation of the observed hadronic spectra of all species and for all @xmath0 measured up to 20 gev / c .",
    "hard parton scattering and hydrodynamical flow are processes that involve very different time scales",
    ". it would be hard to incorporate them into a unified formalism that describes all aspects of the system , including thermalization time , initial configuration , fluid nature of the medium , its quenching effect on the hard protons , the creation of shower partons , and the hadronization of all partons at the end of the whole process .",
    "our attempt here is far from being so ambitious .",
    "we focus only on the @xmath0 dependencies of the hadrons produced from 0.5 to 20 gev in a formalism that can be valid throughout that range , provided that we use some model inputs for the thermal component of the low-@xmath0 behavior to supplement the hard component that can be calculated at high @xmath0 .",
    "we use quark recombination to treat hadronization , applied uniformly at all @xmath0 . in treating the degradation of momenta of hard and semihard partons",
    "we shall adjust some parameters to fit the high-@xmath0 data . since we aim to confront the @xmath0 spectra of all observed hadrons , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the system is highly constrained .",
    "the primary feature of this study is to quantify the effect of hard and semihard jets on the soft sector .",
    "what we find is that the soft partons generated by the hard partons are so much more at lhc , compared to the situation at rhic , that any treatment without including that aspect of the problem would be incomplete .",
    "our investigation of produced hadrons with various contents of strangeness also reveals contrasting features of heavy - ion physics not commonly addressed .",
    "whereas hard scattering of gluons and light quarks can readily occur at high energies , jet fragmentation into multi - strange hadrons like @xmath5 and @xmath4 is rare even at lhc .",
    "but the production of @xmath5 relative to @xmath6 grows exponentially with @xmath0 even to the highest @xmath0 measured , the data for which will be exhibited explicitly in the next section .",
    "surely , one can not expect @xmath5 to be easily produced at @xmath7 gev / c by jet fragmentation .",
    "an explanation of the observed phenomenon must be an integral part of a description of the production mechanism of all hadrons .    to give a description of the experimental motivation for our study",
    ", we show in sec .",
    "ii several pieces of data presented in novel ways so as to emphasize the problems that have not been commonly discussed .",
    "it will become clear that the hadronization problem at lhc is drastically different from that at rhic . in the framework of the recombination models @xcite in which the partons just before hadronization are categorized into thermal ( t ) and shower ( s ) partons , that difference at lhc can be succinctly stated in the form that s is much greater than t at low @xmath0 for light quarks , but not strange quarks .",
    "such a statement has no phenomenological consequence unless the hadronization of those quarks is treated by recombination .",
    "we do not consider here other features of heavy - ion collisions besides @xmath0 distributions , most notably the azimuthal dependence in non - central collision .",
    "conventional description of elliptic flow does not consider the effects of jets .",
    "we shall treat that subject separately , after our concern about the shower partons establishes a footing in the general terrain of heavy - ion physics .    to clarify the nature of our approach",
    "it is necessary to contrast it from the standard model based on hydrodynamics .",
    "if hard and semihard partons produced in high - energy - energy nuclear collisions are important in their effects on soft particles , then one should recognize that their in - medium radiated daughter partons take some time to thermalize , much longer than the rapid equilibration time ( @xmath8 fm / c ) usually assumed in hydro calculations .",
    "a hard parton produced near the center of the medium in central collisions would take about 6 fm / c to reach the surface .",
    "thus rapid thermalization is not realistic if minijets are important , as we shall show that they are at lhc . as a consequence ,",
    "we can not make use of hydro results in our approach , nor can hydro results be used to censure our calculations . for example , the thermal parton  that we consider is not to be identified with any  of the fluid constituents in the hydro medium .",
    "also , in the hydro treatment @xmath9 is identified with elliptic flow , but it is only a possible , not a necessary , explanation .",
    "other explanations are also possible ; see , for example , refs .",
    "in this paper we consider only central collisions and establish the importance of shower partons at low momenta .",
    "it is suggested that a reader withhold comparison with hydro treatment until the main points advanced here can be made .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we show experimental features that motivate this investigation .",
    "section iii describes the general formulation of our approach to the problem .",
    "shower parton distributions are discussed in detail in sec .  iv with emphasis on how the degradation of parton momenta is treated . with those partons shown to be dominant",
    ", the recombination of shower partons from nearby jets becomes a possibility that is considered in sec .",
    "v. with all the basic inputs on partons at hand we then proceed to the determination of the transverse - momentum distributions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in sec .",
    "multi - strange hyperons and meson are treated in sec .",
    "vii with detail equations given in the appendices .",
    "section viii contains our conclusion .",
    "we show first some data from lhc that can be taken to suggest something unusual about the usual observables . compared to the data at rhic energies and below",
    ", it seems that simple extrapolation to pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev is likely to miss some new physics .",
    "the charged - particle multiplicity density averaged over @xmath12 for 0 - 5% central collisions is shown in fig .  1 as a function of collision energy @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "what is notable is that a straight line can be drawn through all the points in the semilog plot from @xmath14 gev to 200 gev , but at 2.76 tev the lhc data point deviates significantly from the straight - line extrapolation .",
    "a power - law fit can be made to connect the rhic and lhc points for @xmath15 gev , as shown in @xcite , resulting in the behavior @xmath16 , but that would overlook the distinctive feature of the lhc point . the dramatic increase above the logarithmic dependence suggests the onset of new physics .",
    "another difference between lhc and rhic is the dependence on @xmath0 . from the @xmath0 distributions measured at the two energies , 2.76 and 0.2 tev",
    ", we can calculate their ratio .",
    "when the data points are not in the same @xmath0 bin , we make lagrangian interpolation between adjacent bins in the rhic data @xcite to match the lhc bin @xcite . the result for pion",
    "is shown by the solid ( black ) line in fig .  2 .",
    "note the exponential increase by two orders of magnitude as @xmath0 is increased up to 10 gev / c .",
    "similar increases are noted for @xmath6 and @xmath5 up to @xmath17 gev / c .",
    "the ratios are all around 2 for @xmath18 gev / c , consistent with what we see in fig .  1 where the lhc / rhic ratio of the multiplicity densities at mid - rapidity per participant - pair is @xmath19 . of course ,",
    "most of the particles contributing to that ratio are pions with @xmath20 gev / c .",
    "but for @xmath21 gev / c , there are abundantly more particles produced at lhc than at rhic .",
    "it is not unexpected that more high-@xmath0 particles are produced at higher collision energy .",
    "the question is what effects do the hard scatterings of partons have on the production of intermediate-@xmath0 hadrons at @xmath22 gev / c .",
    "furthermore , it is reasonable to ask whether the physics at low @xmath0 can be treated by hydrodynamics as at rhic , totally decoupled from the physics at high @xmath0 . if jets are copiously produced in order to account for a factor of @xmath23 at @xmath24 gev / c in fig .  2",
    ", why would their fragmentation products not populate the low-@xmath0 region below 2 gev / c ?",
    "our knowledge on fragmentation functions derived by leptonic collisions tells us that the distribution of hadronic products increased monotonically with decreasing momentum fraction @xcite .     denoting @xmath25 ,",
    "the ratios @xmath26 vs @xmath0 are shown for @xmath27 .",
    "the data are from @xcite . ]    finally , we show another plot of data from lhc that is thought provoking . from the @xmath0 distributions of @xmath6 and @xmath5 measured by alice @xcite , we plot their ratio vs @xmath0 as shown by the solid ( black ) line in fig .",
    "the general trend is an exponential rise up to the highest available @xmath0 with an increase of a factor of 10 .",
    "the conventional understanding of hadrons produced at @xmath28 gev / c is by the fragmentation of hard scattered gluons or light - quarks .",
    "however , @xmath29-quark jets are highly suppressed ; moreover , even if an @xmath29 quark is produced at high @xmath0 , its fragmentation into @xmath5 is even more suppressed . to our knowledge",
    "it has never been measured , let alone at @xmath7 gev / c .",
    "figure 3 shows that the @xmath30 ratio at rhic in dashed ( red ) line also grows exponentially until @xmath31 gev / c and then decreases slowly .",
    "the phenomena at both energies are clearly calling for an explanation .",
    "vs @xmath0 for central collision at rhic and lhc .",
    "the data are from @xcite . ]",
    "to calculate the @xmath0 distribution at mid - rapidity for all hadrons , we use the same formalism as described earlier for au - au collisions at 200 gev @xcite and for pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev @xcite , i.e. , the recombination of thermal and shower partons .",
    "we shall use an improved version of the treatment of momentum degradation @xcite and adjust the degradation parameters to fit the lhc data over a wider range of @xmath0 . as a consequence , the study in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath32 gev / c is superseded because the inclusion of harder jets up to 30 gev / c with less momentum degradation results in a profusion of soft shower partons .",
    "furthermore , we shall include also the production of multi - strange hadrons .",
    "the high density of shower partons introduces another complication , which is the recombination of partons from different , but adjacent , jets .",
    "although that component turns out not to be dominant , its effect is not negligible and must be calculated so as to ascertain its magnitude .    the basic framework that describes the recombination of thermal and shower partons at midrapidity is straightforward @xcite @xmath33 f_{q_1q_2q_3}(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) { r}_{q_1q_2q_3}^b(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_t )     \\label{32}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the essence is in the details of what the symbols mean .",
    "the lhs of eqs .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) and ( [ 32 ] ) are the invariant @xmath0 distributions of meson and baryon , respectively , averaged over @xmath34 at midrapidity and over all @xmath4 .",
    "they appear as invariant s in the 1d momentum space , but are derived from the invariant  in 3d as follows : @xmath35 with @xmath36 being a narrow interval at @xmath37 , say from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "thus our formalism here is not framed to address the global properties of the nuclear collisions , such as total charge multiplicity or long - range correlation .",
    "the parton momenta @xmath40 are the transverse momenta ( with the subscript @xmath41 omitted ) of the coalescing quarks . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the recombination functions ( rfs ) for meson and baryon , respectively .",
    "the central issue in the formalism is the determination of the parton distribution @xmath44 and @xmath45 just before hadronization .",
    "because we intend to treat hadron produced in as wide a range in @xmath0 as experimental data on identified particles are available ( for pion up to 20 gev / c ) , we must consider partons that are produced in soft , semihard and hard scatterings .",
    "we group them into two classes of partons , thermal ( @xmath46 ) and shower ( @xmath47 ) , and use @xmath48 and @xmath49 to denote their invariant distributions in @xmath40 .",
    "taking into account the recombination of different types of partons , we thus have @xmath50    we do not commit ourselves to any specific hydrodynamical description of the soft partons , a position that is made more reasonable when , as will be seen below , low-@xmath0 hadrons can be strongly influenced by shower partons at lhc , thus rendering hydro approach to be inadequate even at low @xmath0 .",
    "it dose not mean that we do not recognize the picture that the hot and dense medium created in heavy - ion collision expands .",
    "we leave open the issues concerning equilibration time , viscosity , freeze - out dynamics , etc .",
    ", since undetermined parameters can not be adjusted to fit the data at low @xmath0 when the effects of shower partons can not be ignored . more specifically , we are concerned with the copious production of hard and semihard jets , whose initiating partons can take up to @xmath51 fm / c to reach the surface , depending on where they are created in the overlapping nuclei and which directions they move in the transverse plane .",
    "they can radiate gluons along their in - medium trajectories , and those gluons would take a long time to thermalize with the soft partons in the medium , longer than the short thermalization time @xmath8 fm / c assumed in hydrodynamical treatment .",
    "the effects of such hard and semihard partons may be ignored in the soft region if they are rarely produced , as at lower collision energies .",
    "but at lhc they are important and can not be neglected .",
    "if the basic tenets of hydro are not reliable , the notion of what is thermal must be liberated from the constraints of hydrodynamics .",
    "the shower partons generated in the medium interact with the bulk partons , and can not be distinguished from the latter by the time the density of all soft partons is low enough for hadronization .",
    "they are all referred to here as thermal partons in the final stage of the quark matter as they move out of the deconfinement phase . the shower partons that we consider are the fragmentation products of the hard and semihard partons that emerge from the surface after momentum degradation .",
    "they are distinguished from the thermal partons that are in their environment .",

    "( [ 35 ] ) is used for both pion and proton , since the proton data for @xmath83 is not exponential .",

    "low - order perturbative qcd is not reliable for virtuality less than 8 gev / c , so the major portion of the contribution to the shower partons in the soft region can not make use of the established theory .",
    "furthermore , the usual calculation based on dglap evolution equation is on medium modification of the fragmentation function , while we need shower parton  for the purpose of recombination .",
    "the dependence on the medium is usually described in terms of entropy density and local flow velocity , which are hydrodynamical quantities tuned to fit low-@xmath0 data , which are exactly what we attempt to reproduce in addition to intermediate-@xmath0 data independent of fluid dynamics . for these reasons we use a phenomenological procedure that has been shown to generate the azimuthal and @xmath0 dependencies of @xmath103 at rhic @xcite and",

    "one notable difference is that this time even @xmath273 is suppressed relative to @xmath282 .",
    "that is because every coalescing quark for @xmath5 must be strange , so @xmath276 in @xmath273 lowers its magnitude relative to @xmath282 . herein lies a very interesting point that was noticed several years ago even in rhic data @xcite",
    "the @xmath0 distribution of @xmath5 is exponential ( apart from the prefactor @xmath283 in eq .",

    "in reality , as we have seen in fig .  3 , the ratio for lhc rises by only a factor of 10 .",
    "the reason is , of course , the dominance of the @xmath102 shower partons in the production of proton , as evident from fig .",
    "10 , where fragmentation is not important until @xmath288 gev / c .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath29 shower partons are unimportant for the production of @xmath5 , which can adequately be described by the exponential behavior of ttt alone . in fig .",
    "3 we have noted the difference between lhc and rhic in the @xmath0 dependencies of @xmath30 . while @xmath5 production at rhic is also mainly ttt and thus exponential @xcite , fig .",
    "18 in appendix a shows that the @xmath0 distribution for proton at rhic has a transition from ttt to tts in the region @xmath289 gev / c .",
    "that accounts for the saturation of @xmath30 in that region in fig .",
    "that transition is absent in fig .",
    "10 for lhc , hence no saturation seen for lhc in fig .  3 .",
    "all these inter - related phenomena can be traced to the simple source , namely : @xmath102 shower partons are abundant at lhc , not @xmath29 shower partons .",
    "lastly , we consider the production of @xmath4 , for which the equations are given in appendix f. since no light quarks are involved in the formation of both @xmath5 and @xmath4 , we use the same value of @xmath245 for both , i.e. , @xmath284 gev . by varying @xmath290 only for the overall normalization ,",
    "we obtain the result shown in fig .  16 for @xmath291 .",
    "the underlying components are very similar to those for @xmath5 , namely : tt dominates over ts , while ss ( whether 1j or 2j ) is nearly 2 orders of magnitudes farther down .     produced in pb - pb collision at @xmath1 tev .",

    "the value of @xmath292 depends on aspects of the process that are not included in the formalism discussed in this paper , and therefore can not be predicted . the same remarks can be made for the formation of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , for which @xmath295 and @xmath296 are quite small in eqs .",

    "the degradation of momenta of hard and semihard partons is treated in a way that uses two free parameters , which are determined by fitting the high-@xmath0 distribution of the pion .",
    "the resultant shower - parton distributions of @xmath102 and @xmath29 quarks are then used to calculate the spectra of all hadrons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "they agree well with the data for all @xmath0 up to 20 gev / c .",
    "the description not only establishes a consistent scheme for treating the hadronization process of a quark - gluon plasma at lhc , but also points out the importance of the effects of minijets on the pion and proton distributions at low and intermediate @xmath0  yet not at all on the @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions on the other end of the spectrum in strangeness content .",
    "the dominance of light shower partons over the thermal partons in nearly the whole range of parton momenta is an observation we make on the basis of an adopted form of the thermal parton distribution @xmath145 .",
    "while the shower parton distribution @xmath144 can be calculated , we have no dynamical scheme to calculate @xmath145 , which is at the final stage of the evolution of the dense medium , dilute enough to enter into the confinement process .",
    "since hadronization is insensitive to the initial process in which the dense medium is created , we have used the @xmath145 determined at rhic , where thermal partons dominate the low-@xmath0 region of all particles produced .",
    "the use of that @xmath145 for our treatment at lhc is justified by the fact that alice data @xmath230 and @xmath6 distributions at low @xmath0 are well reproduced by our results in which @xmath155 and @xmath273 components dominate . any more ( or less )",
    "thermal partons would not have resulted in satisfactory fits of the low-@xmath0 data , since the density of soft shower partons is constrained by the fragmentation of hard and semihard jets .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to compare @xmath144 with @xmath145 and arrive at the conclusion that there are far more soft shower partons than thermal parton at lhc .",
    "it then follows that any theoretical treatment of hadrons produced at low @xmath0 would be incomplete without taking the effects of minijets into account .",
    "in particular , the parameters in the hydrodynamical formalism can not be determined by phenomenology in the soft sector without including also the soft partons from minijets .",
    "it may be of interest to mention here that there is a phenomenological two - component model , in which the hard component exerts a strong influence on the production of pions in the low-@xmath0 region to the extent that the validity of hydrodynamical treatment of soft hadrons is questioned @xcite .",
    "although the physical basis for that observation may share some common ground with what we have found here ( despite the very different languages and concepts used ) , it should be emphasized that our shower partons are dominant only at lhc , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite contends the importance of the hard component in the soft region even at rhic .",
    "the dominance of @xmath132 over @xmath59 for production of @xmath230 and @xmath6 does not apply to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath29 quarks in the shower are suppressed , so @xmath155 and @xmath273 are lower than @xmath297 and @xmath282 , respectively . the other particles ( @xmath298 and @xmath3 ) with less strangeness contents are in the intermediate situation .",
    "the recombination of thermal partons as the mechanism for the production of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is therefore a satisfactory explanation for their @xmath0 distributions up to 6.5 gev / c that is too high for hydrodynamics and too abundantly produced for fragmentation .",
    "a serious consequence of our conclusion about shower partons dominating over thermal partons is its implication on azimuthal anisotropy in non - central collisions .",
    "the usual explanation is that the azimuthal harmonics are due to the flow effects of the fluctuations of the initial configuration of the collision system .",
    "if , however , the non - flow effects such as minijets are important , the fluid treatment would be inadequate on the one hand , and our approach is in need of suitable treatment to be convincing on the other . for au - au collisions at 200 gev",
    ", we have shown that the azimuthal harmonics can be obtained by taking into account the azimuthal dependence of minijet and the related ridge effect @xcite .",
    "now for pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev we have only investigated the case of central collisions here . to extend the study to non - central collisions is , of course , the natural problem to pursue next .",
