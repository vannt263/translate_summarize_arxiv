    "[ [ motivation ] ] motivation + + + + + + + + + +    a common theme in topological data analysis is the analysis of point cloud data representing an unknown manifold .",
    "although the ambient space can be high - dimensional , the manifold itself is usually of relatively low dimension .",
    "manifold learning techniques try to infer properties of the manifold , like its dimension or its homological properties , from the point sample .",
    "an early step in this pipeline is to construct a cell complex from the point sample which shares similarities with the hidden manifold .",
    "the _ echcomplex at scale @xmath5 _",
    "( with @xmath6 ) captures the intersection structure of balls of radius @xmath5 centered at the input points .",
    "more precisely , it is the _ nerve _ of these balls , and is therefore homotopically equivalent to their union .",
    "increasing @xmath5 from @xmath7 to @xmath8 yields a _ filtration _ , a sequence of nested echcomplexes , which can serve as the basis of multi - scale approaches for topological data analysis .",
    "a notorious problem with echcomplexes is their representation : its @xmath9-skeleton can consist of up to @xmath10 simplices , where @xmath11 is the number of input points .",
    "moreover , its construction requires the computation of minimum enclosing balls of point sets ; we will make this relation explicit in section  [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "a common workaround is to replace the echcomplex by the _",
    "( vietoris-)rips complex _ at the same scale @xmath5 .",
    "its definition only depends on the diameter of point sets and can therefore be computed by only looking at the pairwise distances .",
    "although rips complexes permit a sparser representation , they do not resolve the issue that the final complex can consist of a large number of simplices ; sheehy  @xcite and dey et al .",
    "@xcite have recently addressed this problem by defining an approximate rips filtration whose size is only linear in the input size . on the other hand , efficient methods for approximating minimum enclosing balls have been established , even for high - dimensional problems , whereas the diameter of point sets appears to be a significantly harder problem in an approximate context .",
    "this suggests that echcomplexes might be more suitable objects than rips complexes in an approximate context .",
    "[ [ contribution ] ] contribution + + + + + + + + + + + +    we give two different approaches to approximate filtrations of echcomplexes , both connecting the problem to well - known concepts in discrete geometry : the first approach yields , for a fixed constant dimension , a sequence of complexes , each of linear size in the number of input points , that approximate the echfiltration . by approximate , we mean that the _ persistence diagrams _ of exact and approximate echfiltration differ by a arbitrarily small multiplicative factor . to achieve this result",
    ", we generalize the famous _ well - separated pair decomposition ( wspd ) _ to a higher - dimensional analogue , that we call the _ well - separated simplicial decomposition ( wssd)_. intuitively , a wssd decomposes a point set @xmath0 into @xmath12 tuples .",
    "a @xmath9-tuple in the wssd can be viewed as @xmath9 clusters of points of @xmath0 with the property that whenever a ball contains at least one point of each cluster , a small expansion of the ball contains all points in all clusters .",
    "furthermore , these tuples cover every simplex with vertices in @xmath0 , i.e. , given any @xmath9-simplex @xmath13 , there is a @xmath14-tuple of clusters such that each cluster contains on vertex of @xmath13 .",
    "we consider the introduction of wssds to be of independent interest : given the numerous applications of wspd , we hope that its generalization will find further applications in approximate computational topology .",
    "we finally remark that , similar to related work on the rips filtration  @xcite , the constant in the size of our filtration depends exponentially on the dimension of the ambient space , which restricts the applicability to low- and medium - dimensional spaces .    as our second contribution",
    ", we prove a generalized version of the well - known vietoris - rips lemma  @xcite which states that the echcomplex at scale @xmath5 is contained in the rips complex at scale @xmath15 .",
    "we define a family of complexes , called _ completion complexes _ such that for any @xmath16 , the echcomplex at scale @xmath5 is contained in a completion complex at scale @xmath17 .",
    "these completions complexes are parametrized by an integer @xmath9 ; the @xmath9-completion is completely determined by its @xmath9-skeleton , consisting of up to @xmath10 complexes . to achieve @xmath3-closeness to the echcomplex",
    ", we need to set @xmath18 ( see theorem  [ thm : interleaving ] for the precise statement ) ; in particular , there is no dependence on the ambient dimension to approximate the echcomplex arbitrarily closely .",
    "for proving this result , we use _ coresets _ for minimum enclosing ball ( meb )  @xcite : the meb of a set of points can be approximated by selecting only a small subset of the input which is called a _",
    "coreset _ ; here approximation means that an @xmath16-expansion of the meb of the coreset contains all input points .",
    "the size of the smallest coreset is at most @xmath19 , independent of the number of points and the ambient dimension , and this bound is tight  @xcite . to obtain our result",
    ", we relax the definition of coreset for minimum enclosing balls .",
    "we only require the _ radius _ of the meb to be approximated , not the meb itself .",
    "we prove that even smaller coresets of size roughly @xmath20 always exist for approximating the radius of the meb .",
    "again , we consider this coreset result to be of independent interest .",

    "let @xmath302 denote the simplex spanned by such a coreset . as @xmath302 is a face of @xmath13 ,",
    "it is contained in @xmath464 , and because it is of dimension at most @xmath466 , it is in particular contained in @xmath467 . by the property of coresets , the minimal enclosing ball of @xmath13",
    "has radius at most @xmath17 which implies that @xmath468 .    as a special case , consider the choice @xmath469 , so that @xmath470 .",
    "the above result yields that @xmath471 which is exactly the statement of the vietoris - rips lemma as stated in @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ thm : interleaving ] and lemma  [ lem : pat ] prove the closeness of the persistence diagrams of the echfiltration and the completion complex :    [ thm : completion_theorem ] the persistence diagram of @xmath472 with @xmath473 is a @xmath3-approximation of the persistence diagram of @xmath474 .",

    "we have presented two distinct ways to approximate echcomplexes ; the fixed - dimensional result on approximating the echfiltration to linear size is a technically challenging , but conceptually straight - forward extension of recent work on the rips filtration ; however , we believe that the concept of wssds to be interesting and hopefully applicable in different contexts , and we plan to identify application scenarios in the future .",
    "our high - dimensional results are a first attempt to link the areas of computational topology , where data is often high - dimensional , and geometric approximation algorithms that try to overcome the curse of dimensionality .",
    "we want to achieve algorithmic results in that context in the future ; one question is whether an optimal - size radius coreset can be computed efficiently .",
    "moreover , the introduced concept of completions is not tied to start completing simplices at a fixed dimension ; in fact , one can start with any complex @xmath21 ( not necessarily a skeleton ) and define the completion as the largest complex containing @xmath21 . with such _ adaptive completions _ , @xmath16-close approximations of the echfiltration might be possible with just a slightly larger representation size than the rips filtration .",
    "the open question is , however , whether such a representation can be computed efficiently .",
    "finally , we pose the question whether there are other applications , besides approximating echcomplexes , where the smaller size of radius - coresets in comparison to meb - coresets could be useful ."
