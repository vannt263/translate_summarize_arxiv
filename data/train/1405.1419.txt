    "this leads to a large release of energy , called the he - flash , which during a period of about 2 myr lifts the degeneracy of the core leading to a stable he - burning phase .",
    "such a transition phase has a unique asteroseismic signature @xcite .    in our models during the he - flash the rotational period of the core increases quite rapidly by a factor of about 10",
    "this is because the nuclear energy released results in core expansion . in our @xmath7 model",
    "the @xmath68 core expands by approximately a factor of 3 during the he - flash , with core moment of inertia increasing by a factor of 10 from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "even if the timescale of the he - flash is too short for angular momentum transport outside the core , we note that the convective episodes that accompany the he flash can potentially play an important role in the redistribution of angular momentum inside the he - core .",
    "such rapid mixing episodes can change the rotational profile of the g - mode cavity , as they lead to a fairly rigidly rotating radiative region above core he - burning .",

    "similar to the case of the early rgb , these values are about 1 order of magnitude slower than models which include magnetic torques , again pointing toward the need for some extra angular momentum transport occurring in previous evolutionary phases . note that models including an artificial diffusivity able to reproduce the observed splitting on the early rgb ( @xmath72 ) fail to explain the rotation rates of clump stars , with predicted rotation rates almost two orders of magnitude higher than the observations .",

    "we note that a combination of an artificial viscosity @xmath72 with the tayler - spruit magnetic torques can reproduce both the early rgb and the clump observations .",
    "after core he burning the energy generation proceeds in two shells ( burning h and he ) moving outwards in mass coordinate while the star moves up the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "the he - shell becomes secularly unstable , giving rise to thermal pulses ( tp - agb ) .",
    "these pulses grow in intensity and are thought to enhance mass loss , ultimately leading to a complete removal of the h - envelope , a planetary nebula and the transition to the white dwarf cooling sequence . the details are not well understood and the transition time from the agb to the wd cooling sequence depends on the treatment of mass - loss beyond the agb .",
    "note however that the timescale for angular momentum transport between core and envelope is likely much longer than the range of timescales discussed for the duration of this phase , so that the results on the angular momentum content of wd models should not depend strongly on the particular treatment of this phase .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the observed wd rotation rates can be recovered from the observed core rotation of clump stars assuming no angular momentum transport ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "[ period_evolution ] ) .",
    "it is true that this is only achieved assuming clump rotation rates on the high end of the observed distribution ; however one has to be careful as the mass range of the observed clump stars does not necessarily match the mass range of the progenitors of the wd with observed rotation rates .    in our calculations during the tp - agb phase we adopt the mass loss prescription of @xcite multiplied by an efficiency factor @xmath73 .",

    "<S> we find that all models fail to predict core rotation as slow as observed on the rgb and during core he burning , implying that an unmodeled angular momentum transport process must be operating on the early rgb of low mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> later evolution of the star from the he burning clump to the cooling wd phase appears to be at nearly constant core angular momentum . </S>",
