    "the essence of the physics of high @xmath0 cuprates boils down to the problem of how to treat the dual nature of the electrons which form local moments in the insulator , and yet make up a fermi surface when doped with @xmath5 holes .",
    "this problem was brought into sharp focus with the discovery of anomalous properties in the physics of the `` underdoped '' region which lies between the antiferromagnetic insulator and the optimally doped superconductor . how does the fermi surface evolve from small hole pockets near @xmath6 in a slightly doped antiferromagnet to the full fermi surface obeying luttinger s theorem in the optimally doped materials ?",
    "what are the magnetic properties in this intermediate doping region ?",
    "experimentalists have already answered a substantial part of these questions . in particular",
    ", the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has shown the existence in the normal state of a gap with the same anisotropy as the d - wave gap of the superconducting state@xcite .",
    "low - lying excitations are observed along a patch near @xmath7 [ `` fermi surface segments '' ] , but the fermi surface , in the veritable sense of the word , does not exist .",
    "the arpes results might have been accepted without much grudge simply as a plausible interpolation between the antiferromagnet and the optimally doped superconductor , had our understanding of metals not been so entrenched in the fermi liquid theory ; the notion of a metal without a fermi surface is a serious embarrassment . at the same time , gaplike suppression of spin excitations are seen in nmr@xcite : the knight shift and spin - lattice relaxation rates all decrease with decreasing temperature below certain temperatures .",
    "gaplike features in the underdoped cuprates might remind us of the spin liquids  the liquid of spin singlets .",
    "yet the devil is in the details , and the underdoped cuprates deviate significantly from `` gapped spin liquids '' like spin 1/2 ladders and integer spin chains .",
    "the latter have an even number of spins per unit cell and the ground state is a spin singlet .",
    "they are characterized by a clear gap to the lowest triplet excitation that is inversely related to the correlation length ; this gap can be seen in inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "the magnetic responses like uniform susceptibility and the nmr relaxation rate as a function of temperature have activated behaviors .",
    "many of them can be satisfactorily described in terms of the `` quantum disordered '' phase of the nonlinear sigma model @xmath8@xcite which can be also understood in terms of the @xmath9 model involving _ bosonic _ `` spinons '' ( @xmath10 fields )  these spin 1/2 excitations are said to be confined , as they do not appear in the basic physical spectra@xcite . in other words ,",
    "a description of the excitations in terms of fluctuating spin 1 objects is most natural for them .",
    "on the other hand , in the underdoped cuprates , inelastic neutron scattering does not show a `` full gap''@xcite .",
    "the decrease of the knight shift with decreasing temperature looks more like a power - law . on the whole , the magnetic excitation spectrum of the cuprates seems to display a curious mixture of singlet and antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "there are evidences for antiferromagnetic correlations from the * q*-space scan of neutron scattering cross section , and from the difference in the temperature dependence of the nmr relaxation rates : the oxygen @xmath11 ( which has little contribution from spin excitations near wave vector @xmath12 ) monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature , while the copper @xmath11 ( which weighs @xmath13 spin excitation strongly ) increases with decreasing temperature until around 150k and then falls@xcite .",
    "the antiferromaget - singlet debate has enormous ramifications for theories of high @xmath0  cuprates ( for a succinct review , see ref . ) .",
    "some theorists@xcite have advocated the picture of fermi liquid quasiparticles exchanging `` antiparamagnons '' for understanding the anomalous normal state properties and the superconductive pairing .",
    "such a view is not shared here . instead of viewing the antiferromagnetic fluctuations as the cause of superconductivity in a bcs - like scenario , in this paper we would rather regard them as a residual but important consequence of local repulsive interactions that lead to superconductivity in the presence of doped holes , a part of nature s conspiracy to find a compromise between a magnetic ground state and an itinerant metallic state .",
    "this line of thinking goes back to anderson s seminal 1987 paper@xcite on the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theory , in which he reasoned that doped holes may propagate coherently in a liquid of spin singlets .",
    "theoretical attempts to realize anderson s rvb picture are based on strong coupling models , such as the one band hubbard model or the @xmath1-@xmath2  model@xcite .",
    "these models are considered to contain some essential physics of the cuprates at appropriate parameter values @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2  model , the simpler of the two , captures in a transparent way what is believed to be the basic physics , namely the competition between the magnetic exchange and the delocalization energy of holes .",
    "the no - double - occupancy constraint in the @xmath1-@xmath2  model can be taken care of by writing the electron operator as a composite of a neutral fermion ( spinon ) and a spinless boson ( holon ) [ @xmath16 and demanding each site be occupied by either a fermion or a boson @xmath17 ) .",
    "the theory then contains four - particle interactions which can be decoupled by introducing `` mean fields '' like @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . within the mean field approach , kotliar and liu , and fukuyama and coworkers@xcite",
    "have studied the phase diagram of the @xmath1-@xmath2  model . at low doping",
    "( and below some temperature scale ) , it was found that the phases in which the fermions are paired into d - wave singlets ( @xmath21)are favored . depending on whether the bosons are condensed , they could be superconducting ( sc phase ) or normal ( `` d - wave rvb phase '' ) .    as noted by rice@xcite and others , the fermionic mean field theory captures some important features of the spin gap phenomena in the underdoped cuprates that refuse clear - cut characterization in terms of a well - defined correlation length and relaxation times .",
    "the theory describes some kind of quantum spin liquid , but unlike gapped spin liquids , there is a particle - hole ( spinon - antispinon ) continuum , which would create some spectral weight for magnetic excitations at arbitrarily low energy .",
    "more specifically , the dirac spectrum ( @xmath22 ) of the fermionic quasiparticles in the d - wave rvb phase gives the knight shift @xmath23 and the oxygen site nmr relaxation rate @xmath24 , in rough agreement with experiments in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "moreover , the absence of the gap in the charge response ( for example , the in - plane optical conductivity ) could be explained simply , since the spin and charge degrees of freedom are separated , _",
    "i.e. _ the spin is carried by fermionic spinons while the charge is carried by bosonic holons .",
    "a dirac - type spectrum as in the d - wave rvb phase was also found by affleck and marston who considered the @xmath4-flux phase@xcite as a possible spin liquid ground state of the cuprates .",
    "it turned out that at half filling the d - wave phase with @xmath25 is equivalent to the flux phase , due to a local su(2 ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "wen and one of us reasoned that this symmetry might still be a pretty good ( and important ) symmetry at small dopings , and came up with a slave boson theory that respects the su(2 ) symmetry even away from half filling by introducing an su(2 ) doublet of slave bosons , hoping to get a better description of underdoped cuprates@xcite .",
    "in this theory , the mean field corresponding to the `` spin gap '' phase of the underdoped cuprates was identified as the `` sflux phase '' which can be considered a combination of the d - wave rvb phase and the staggered flux phase@xcite of the u(1 ) theory .",
    "this phase also has fermions with a dirac spectrum , but _ in contrast to the d - wave rvb phase of the u(1 ) mean field theory_@xcite , _ the fluctuations around this mean field include a massless gauge field which is expected to affect strongly the magnetic and transport properties of the system_@xcite . with the inclusion of a residual attraction between bosons and fermions , the sflux phase was shown to reproduce the gross features of the arpes , such as the fermi surface segments near @xmath26 and a large gap at @xmath27 .    despite the successes , the mean field treatments ( both the su(2 ) theory and its predessesors ) are unsatisfactory in several respects .",
    "for example , it is not clear how the spin gap phase is connected to the nel ordered phase at zero doping . _",
    "the mean field ansatz loses a lot of antiferromagnetic correlation _ ; within the mean field theory , the copper site @xmath11 has a similar behavior as the oxygen site @xmath11 , in disagreement with experiments@xcite .",
    "attempts to fix the problem by some kind of rpa can not produce , in a natural manner , different temperature scales which mark the decrease of the copper and oxygen site relaxation rates@xcite .",
    "another serious question is the role of gauge fluctuations around the mean field solution which had not been studied carefully so far .",
    "in fact , a strong gauge fluctuation might destroy the mean field picture altogether , in which case we have to re - identify the elementary excitations of the theory .    in this paper , we look into these questions .",
    "the basic point is that the gauge fluctuations ignored at the mean field level strongly enhance antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the gauge fluctuation could be so strong that the elementary excitations of the mean field theory disappear completely from the low energy spectrum .",
    "this is believed to be the case with the `` u(1 ) @xmath4-flux phase''@xcite description of the undoped cuprates ( antiferromagnet ) , which is a theory of massless dirac fermions coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field ( massless qed3 ) .",
    "the qed3 can be treated in the @xmath3 perturbation theory . for physical @xmath28 ,",
    "a dynamic mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking corresponding to nel ordering would occur@xcite , while for large enough @xmath29 , the theory would still describe some kind of a spin liquid .",
    "the true low energy excitations of the symmetry - broken case are recognized as the goldstone bosons``mesons '' which are a bound state of a particle and an antiparticle ( spinon & antispinon ) .",
    "we note that the local su(2 ) symmetry at half filling can be utilized to write a theory of the undoped system in terms of massless dirac fermions coupled to nonabelian ( su(2 ) ) gauge fields@xcite .",
    "since the u(1 ) theory ( at least initially ) has one massless gauge field while the su(2 ) theory has three , they look quite different . nonetheless , as long as the gauge fluctuations are treated exactly , the two theories should lead to the same physics , namely the nel ordering .",
    "as regards the _ underdoped _ cuprates , we believe that the most promising starting point is the sflux phase of the su(2 ) theory@xcite , which has massless dirac fermions coupled to a massless u(1 ) gauge field as in the affleck - marston flux phase@xcite , but also has nonrelativistic bosons(holons ) coupled to the same gauge field .",
    "we shall argue that , due to this additional coupling , the gauge fluctuations will not destroy the essential validity of the mean field picture , though the picture of antiferromagnetic spin excitations will be modified ( improved ) .",
    "the coupling to the bosons would result in the screening of the time component of the gauge field which will prevent nel ordering . the gauge field will nevertheless mediate an attraction between spinons and antispinons and try to create a bound state with momentum @xmath30 , but due to the particle - hole continuum , this will appear only as a broad resonance .",
    "this can be viewed as a goldstone boson precursor mode that comes down in energy as the transition is approached ( as the boson density is reduced ) .",
    "the recent neutron scattering in underdoped cuprates which sees a broad peak in @xmath31 magnetic response whose energy scale is roughly proportional to doping might be consistent with this point of view@xcite .",
    "we shall also discuss the issue of confinement , as there are lingering questions about the fate of `` spinons '' in the case of strong coupling gauge theories .    in order to illustrate some aspects of the foregoing ideas more concretely ( _ in particular the gauge - fluctuation restoration of antiferromagnetic correlation and the feasibility of a u(1 ) gauge theory description of quantum antiferromagnets _ ) , we ll first reexamine the well known spin half chain from the point of view of the schwinger model .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the 1d heisenberg model as an example where the idea of mean field theory plus gauge fluctuation can be applied to an exactly soluble model .",
    "a number of authors have noted that what emerges is the schwinger model with two flavors @xcite , and abelian @xcite and nonabelian @xcite bosonization methods have been applied to solve for the continuum limit of this model .",
    "here we solve the model using a slightly different technique , i.e. , chiral rotation , which focusses on the role of gauge fluctuations as a way of correcting the underestimate of the antiferromagnetic correlation in mean field theory .",
    "we then show that qualitatively similar results are achieved in @xmath3 perturbation theory of the gauge fluctuations .",
    "this gives us encouragement that a similar approach may be reasonable in the two - dimensional case .",
    "the heisenberg model ( @xmath32 ) in the fermion representation of the spin can be written @xmath33 with the constraint @xmath34 .",
    "the 4-fermion interactions and the constraint can be handled by the introduction of a hubbard - stratonovich field and a lagrange multiplier , which gives @xmath35 within the mean field theory , @xmath36 , hence the mean field hamitonian in the k - space is @xmath37 here @xmath38 denotes sum over the magnetic bz , say @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are even and odd site operators ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "linearizing around @xmath43 , we arrive at the continuum hamiltonian @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a pauli matrix .",
    "this is just the hamiltonian of free dirac fermions ( we have set the velocity of the fermions = 1 ) .",
    "the corresponding ( euclidean space ) lagrangian is @xmath47 where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , and the @xmath50 matrices are @xmath51 in 1 + 1d , we define @xmath52 matrix as @xmath53 , which has the property @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the antisymmetric tensor with @xmath56 ) .    including the fluctuations around the mean field ( the fluctuations of @xmath57 and the phase of @xmath58 ) amounts to coupling the fermions to a u(1 ) gauge field by the minimal prescription .",
    "hence the continuum version of \\{the mean field + fluctuations } is the two flavor schwinger model @xmath59 the apparent gauge coupling ( bare coupling ) is infinitely strong , as there is no kinetic term for the gauge field .",
    "above lagrangian is obviously invariant under the global su(2 ) transform ( spin rotation symmetry ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 are pauli matrices ( belonging to a space different from that of @xmath62 ) .",
    "the lagrangian is also invariant under the `` chiral transformation '' @xmath63 this `` chiral symmetry '' is _ explicitly _ broken by higher derivative terms ignored in taking the continuum limit , like @xmath64 if we label the states by the left and right movers , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , the chiral transformation corresponds to @xmath67    we now consider spin correlation functions at the mean field level ( _ i.e. _ ignoring gauge fields ) .",

    "this peculiar behavior , which was derived by arovas and auerbach in the lattice version of the fermionic mean field theory@xcite and agrees with bulaevskii s hartree - fock treatment of the jordan - wigner fermionized heisenberg model@xcite , is viewed as a pathology of the mean field theory : _ we have lost a substantial amount of antiferromagnetic correlation_.      we now consider the effect of gauge fluctuations .",
    "it is natural to expect that the inclusion of gauge fluctuations will improve the mean field picture .",
    "the time component of the gauge field can be regarded to originate from the lagrange multiplier field ( for no - double - occupancy ) ; this corresponds to gutzwiller - projected ( half - filled tight binding ) fermi surface , which is known to be a pretty good description of 1d antiferromagnet@xcite .",

    "equation ( 25 ) is in fact familiar to the solid state physicists@xcite . in an electric field ,",
    "the equation of motion for the crystal momentum state is @xmath100 in one dimension an electric field causes a shift of the occupation between left moving and right moving states .",
    "thus the left and right movers are in fact connected and their densities are not separately conserved .",
    "it is easy to see that eq.(26 ) is consistent with eq.(25 ) .",
    "the exact spin correlation functions can be evaluated with the use of `` chiral rotation''@xcite . in this approach , the gauge field is written as the sum of a div - free part and a curl - free part : @xmath101 the transform    @xmath102    decouples the gauge field from the @xmath103 fermions .",

    "@xmath113 is cancelled by @xmath114 and @xmath115 is cancelled by @xmath116 under the chiral rotation , so that @xmath117 must also change from real to imaginary .    even though the chiral rotation is unitary",

    "the jacobian @xmath120 for the change of measure @xmath121 can be found easily using the axial anomaly condition eq.[axial](see appendix b for details ) : @xmath122 alternative derivation can be found in ref .. in terms of the new fields , the functional integral is @xmath123 these are `` free '' fields , and now the spin correlation function ( eq.[spincor ] ) can be evaluated easily : @xmath124 where we have used @xmath125 ( @xmath126 is a uv cutoff originating from the lattice theory , and @xmath127 is a nonuniversal constant that depends on high energy details @xmath126 ) . in the physical case ( @xmath86 ) , we then have @xmath128 which agrees with the more accurate result@xcite up to a @xmath129 factor .",
    "the log factor , not captured by the schwinger model , must be due to terms ignored in our derivation from the lattice theory , _",

    "perhaps the best known treatment of the heisenberg spin chain relies on the jordan - wigner transformation ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) .",
    "however , unlike the x - y model , this does not lead to a theory of free fermions , but to a theory with a 4-fermion interaction with coupling constant of order unity , which is then treated by bosonization methods@xcite .",
    "a drawback of the jordan - wigner approach is that the su(2 ) spin symmetry is easily lost , and the correct exponent ( @xmath132 ) of the staggered spin correlation function has to be determined rather indirectly .",
    "haldane@xcite , on the other hand , proposed to analyze the hubbard model , exploiting the `` equivalence '' between the spin sector of the 1d hubbard model @xmath133 and the 1d heisenberg model , that holds even in the weak coupling limit .",

    "we can easily adapt haldane s approach to the schwinger model , which as we point out , is equivalent to the rvb mean field theory plus gauge fluctuations .",
    "this line of approach was recently given in ref.[24 ] .",
    "instead of treating the gauge fluctuation by chiral rotation , we first integrate out the gauge field in eq.(20 ) , which simply enforces the constraint of no double occupation , i.e. , the charge fluctuation is completely suppressed .",

    "we now examine the gauge theory in terms of the perturbation theory in @xmath3 .",
    "the key point is that the nature of the perturbative correction to the mean field results is very different for the uniform part and the antiferromagnetic ( staggered ) part of the spin correlation : while @xmath145 response is strongly affected by perturbative correction , the @xmath146 response receives no correction at all ( the absence of any correction is a special feature of the 1d ) .",

    "similar cancellation is expected at all orders of perturbation theory ; the nonrenormalization of uniform part of the spin correlation function is quite natural , since in our theory @xmath156 and eq.[exact ] is an exact result .    on the other hand ,",

    "thus , for the physical case of @xmath86 , the spontaneous symmetry breaking would not occur!this is what was hoped for our mean field theory .    the attraction in the @xmath12 channel mediated by the gauge field , although not strong enough to generate a condensate , will nevertheless have a strong effect on the spectrum of antiferromagnetic excitation .",
    "the fluctuation of the order parameter associated with the transition ( staggered moment ) can be examined by looking at the staggered - channel spin correlation function in the ladder approximation , similar to the more familiar problems like the superconducting fluctuations or the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations@xcite ( see fig.[ladders ] ) .",

    "unfortunately , in our problem the interaction is retarded and long - ranged , hence the diagrams are not easy to evaluate . nevertheless , on physical grounds ,",
    "it is quite reasonable to expect that the same gauge field which caused the antiferromagnetic instability in the absence of holons will try to create a ( massive ) mode ( particle - hole bound state in the @xmath12 channel ) in this case . because the symmetry is unbroken",
    ", there is a particle - hole continuum , as a result of which a sharp mode can not exist , but a `` broad resonance '' , _",
    "i.e. _ a very unstable meson with a minkowski - space dispersion @xmath273 is expected .",
    "the mass of the mode @xmath274 would come down as the transition is approached ( `` soft mode '' ) .",
    "a physical consequence will be that the dynamic susceptibility @xmath275 ( which can be probed by neutron scattering ) has a broad peak , with a substantial rearrangement of the spectral weight compared to the mean field prediction .",
    "this heuristic picture is consistent with experiments of keimer and collaborators@xcite that find in the normal state ( and in the superconducting state ) of underdoped cuprates a magnetic scattering with a broad peak at some frequency scale that comes down in energy as the doping is reduced .",
    "=    in principle , we should be able to study this by looking into the bethe - salpeter equation for spinon - antispinon scattering amplitude or the associated vertex .",
    "the analysis , however , entails a number of practical and technical difficulties .",
    "we can get around the problem of the complicated lorentz - noninvariant gauge propagator for the doped case ( eq.[lnon ] ) by convincing ourselves that the we would obtain a similar physics by considering a lorentz invariant one @xmath276 with @xmath277 ( reducing the doping would correspond to reducing @xmath278 ) .",
    "still , the fact that we are investigating a mode that is _ massive and damped _ causes complications unseen in the b - s equation for the goldstone bosons of the ordered antiferromagnet .",
    "generally , the scattering amplitude and the vertex have many components ( `` invariant amplitudes '' ) , _ e.g. _ , @xmath279 the goldstone modes are massless , hence we can focus on @xmath280 in which case @xmath281 decouples from other amplitudes and has the same equation as that of the dynamical mass , as we have seen in sec.iii.c .",

    "they claim to find no light meson whose mass comes down to zero as the transition is approached , and hence the transition must be a novel one , _ i.e. _ neither a first order nor a second order transition",
    ". however , this conclusion is questionable , as a well - defined mode ( pole in the scattering amplitude ) in the symmetric phase is too stringent a requirement for a second order phase transition ; more generally what happens in the symmetry - unbroken phase as the second order transition is approached is a build - up of the low energy spectral weight for the response related to the order parameter . in any case",
    ", the analysis of ref . is not appropriate for finding an unstable meson which resides in the second riemann sheet of the minkowski space .",
    "we now discuss briefly the nmr relaxation rates , which measure the very low energy limit of the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "as noted earlier , the mean field theories predict similar behavior of the oxygen and copper site relaxation rates , while experiments show marked difference .",
    "it would be difficult to calculate finite temperature properties within our gauge theory , but we believe that what has been discussed so far throws some light on this issue : once the gauge fluctuation is included , there is no reason why the two relaxation rates should have similar behaviors , since the effect of the gauge field on the * q*=0 and * q*=@xmath13 response is very different .",
    "it is plausible that at high temperature side the cu @xmath11 will be increasing with decreasing temperature , as the gauge fluctuation restores certain amount of antiferromagnetic correlations ( note that above some energy scale , the screening effect of bosons wo nt be too important and the propagator would look like that of the undoped cuprates ) , while at low temperatures ( below some scale ) it will go down with decreasing temperature , since we still have the d - wave gap if the mean field picture is going to survive .",
    "=    finally , we note that in our discussion of antiferromagnetic excitations in underdoped cuprates we have not considered certain class of diagrams that may be important .",
    "an example , shown in fig.[bosfermi ] , involves a boson loop and a fermion loop exchanging a residual attractive interaction .",
    "the set of a boson and a fermion line connected by ladder type interaction can be viewed as a electronlike propagator ( bethe - salpeter equation for electron propagator ) .",
    "this type of contribution may be related to pieces of the fermi surface near @xmath284@xcite , and might provide some clue to the origin of low - frequency incommensurate features observed in the neutron scattering .      in the underdoped",
    "cuprates the gauge field interaction also affects the uniform part of the spin response ( the thermodynamic properties ) though the effects are subtler . more specifically , the coupling of the gauge field to nonrelativistic bosons results in the logarithmic renormalization of the velocity of the fermions , which has the effect of enhancing the specific heat and the uniform susceptibility@xcite .",
    "this seems to be in accordance with experiments on underdoped cuprates .",
    "although one might alternatively view the enhancement features in the normal state as having to do with the `` fermi surface segments '' , these are not really quasiparticle states in the strict sense ( @xmath10=0 ) and there are likely to be theoretical complexity and possibility of overcounting .",
    "it seems a lot simpler to view that the fermions account for most of the entropy and spin response .",
    "a curious feature@xcite of our theory is that the wilson ratio @xmath285 has a value quite close to that of the `` quantum critical '' phase of the nonlinear sigma model@xcite : @xmath286 in our theory is 0.128 , while the @xmath287 nonlinear sigma model gives @xmath288 at zeroth order , and @xmath289 with the inclusion of @xmath3 correction .",
    "could this be a coincidence ?",
    "we now conclude with a discussion of some difficult matters , hoping not so much as to resolve them but to content ourselves with placing them in perspective .",
    "the term `` spinon '' has been used rather carelessly in this paper . in the strict sense , it refers to well - defined neutral elementary excitations carrying spin 1/2 .",
    "a well - known ( and perhaps the only widely - accepted ) example is the solitonic ( topological ) objects in spin chains that are usually understood within the bosonization framework@xcite .",
    "the `` spinons '' in this paper refer most of the times to spin 1/2 fermions strongly coupled to fluctuating gauge fields  the fermions that arise from the rvb mean field theories .",
    "these spinons are far from being well - established . in 1d ,",
    "the fact that they are different from topological spinons ( `` true spinons '' ) has been emphasized by mudry and fradkin@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have seen that in the 1d heisenberg model , the mean field fermions give a reasonable description of the specific heat and uniform susceptibility@xcite ; the zeeman splitting of the spin up and down fermions in a magnetic field and the associated incommensurate magnetic excitations@xcite can be easily understood in terms of the mean field fermions .",
    "furthermore , we showed in section ii that the perturbative treatment of the gauge fluctuations systematically improves the antiferromagnetic correlation .",
    "thus the mean field fermions are not as bad a starting point as some would regard .    in 2d and",
    "3d , pre - high @xmath0  empiricism and experiences provide strong resistance to the notion of spinons as derived from rvb mean field theory .",
    "after all , in most metals ( 2 and 3d ) , the basic elementary excitation is quasiparticles that carry both spin 1/2 and charge @xmath180 , and in most insulating antiferromagnets or in spin liquids ( like spin ladders ) , the elementary excitations are spin 1 objects ( spin waves or magnons ) . in other words , spinons and holons",
    "do not exist on their own , but are `` confined '' in spinon - antispinon composite objects ( spin waves : @xmath290 ) or in spinon - holon composite objects ( quasiparticles : @xmath291 ) .",
    "the sense in which this `` confinement '' is discussed is similar to the quark confinement in particle physics  the absence outside the nucleus of the quarks that make up hadrons ( baryons and mesons ) .",
    "in fact , the strong interaction physics appears to share quite a few parallels with our problem@xcite .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which is widely believed to be the correct theory of strong interactions , is a gauge theory whose low energy physics is as poorly understood as the high @xmath0  cuprates . at a more substantial level",
    ", the phenomenology of strong interactions indicates that the ( approximate ) chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , giving rise to mesons ( such as pions ) which are goldstone bosons , in analogy with spin waves in a nel ordered system . just as the nonlinear sigma model gives an excellent description of the low energy spin dynamics of the undoped cuprates@xcite , in particle physics it has been well known that similar effective lagrangians ( sigma models , chiral perturbation theory@xcite , etc . )",
    "give a very good description of the hadronic physics .",
    "however , attempts to `` derive '' the parameters of the effective theories , such as the pion decay constant , from first principles have not been entirely successful .",
    "the basic difficulty is that the same asymptotic freedom that led to the confirmation of the quark picture at the high energy side causes grave difficuties in analyzing the low energy physics . at present",
    ", no consensus exists as regards the `` mechanism '' of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , but at least it seems clear that the problem is intimately connected to the general issue of confinement .",
    "it is the basic underlying idea of this paper that the confinement does not occur ( at least ) for the normal state of the superconducting cuprates , or more loosely , spinons and holons are `` meaningful '' objects . on the other hand , _",
    "some sort of _ confinement is relevant to the discussion of the nel ordered state in undoped cuprates , since we know that there the low energy excitations are not the spinons but spin waves . in considering the confinement , we are ( helped but also ) burdened by previous studies in particle physics regarding the issue .",
    "the confinement motivated by the strong interaction phenomenology  no color nonsinglet particles exist in the physical spectrum  is a strong statement , and it is not clear to what extent the confinement in our case should match the quark confinement .",
    "for example , we can ask the following questions in 2d undoped systems .",
    "1 ) on the low energy side , are the spin waves the only massless degrees of freedom , or could there be an additional mode hiding ? 2 ) on the high energy side , do the spinon states exist , or have they disappeared completely ?",
    "in other words , can we somehow `` see '' spinons at high energies ?    to address these questions , we need to discuss one possibly important aspect of our gauge theory , the compactness , that has been ignored so far .",
    "the models that we have examined in this paper originate from the lattice , hence are compact gauge theories .",
    "the usual assumption is that the compact theory can be replaced by a more amenable noncompact theory in the continuum , but this is not always justified .",
    "a representative and scary example is the pure gauge theory in 2 + 1d .",
    "polyakov@xcite has shown that the compact pure gauge theory ( 2 + 1d electrodynamics ) differs from the noncompact one due to instantons  the topologically nontrivial , extended classical solutions of euclidean gauge field equations , that can be viewed as tunneling events between topologically inequivalent vacua .",
    "instantons cause the wilson loop to follow the area law @xmath292 , which means the presence of a linear potential @xmath293 between static sources , a sign of ( strong ) confinement .",
    "when matter fields are present as in our case and in qcd , the situation is not so simple . in qcd , for example , despite theoretical attempts@xcite the relevance of instantons to quark confinement remains uncertain . generally , the fluctuations of matter fields ( especially the massless fields ) are adverse to instantons . one specific scenario by which instantons are suppressed is fermion zero modes .",
    "for example , in the massless schwinger model , the fermion determinant @xmath294 $ ] in a gauge configuration @xmath295 with an instanton vanishes , so only the topologically trivial sector contributes to the functional intergral ( partition function ) .",
    "similar mechanism turned out to account for the famous u(1 ) problem@xcite in qcd . in both cases ( 1 + 1d and 3 + 1d )",

    "marston has also calculated the action of an instanton , and found that it is logarithmically divergent with a prefactor proportional to the number of flavors ( @xmath296 ) .",
    "kosterlitz - thouless type argument then indicates that below critical @xmath297 which turns out to be 0.9 , instantons may proliferate , while for @xmath298 which includes the physical case ( @xmath86 ) , the instantons are suppressed .",
    "ioffe & larkin@xcite have also calculated the action of an instanton , considering only the bilinear part of the gauge field action obtained by integrating out the fermions , and found logarithmic divergence , but @xmath297 in this case turns out to be 24 .",
    "it has been noted that this treatment may be too simple , and the question of instantons for physical @xmath29 remains unclear@xcite .    _ the suppression of instantons may no longer be the case if the fermion masses are dynamically generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking , which is indeed our situation .",

    "_ probably the most notable consequence of the instantons is that the gauge field will become massive_@xcite , _ hence the spin waves will be the only low energy excitations of the ordered antiferromagnet . _",
    "on the other hand , in the ( simpler ) scenario without the instantons ( sec.iii.c ) , there is a massless gauge field in addition to the spin waves in the ordered antiferromagnet .",
    "this is rather bothersome , since it is commonly believed that the spin waves deplete the low energy excitations in 2d quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "practically , it may be difficult to determine the absence or the existence of the massless gauge field , as it does not couple to external probes in a simple way .",
    "the gauge field may have a @xmath299 contribution to the specific heat like the spin waves , but the modification of the prefactor due to gauge field might be considered a spin - wave renormalization effect .",
    "the pictures with or without instantons may also have different implications for the spinon confinement .",
    "if the instantons are relevant , the polykov - type nonperturbative mechanism might lead to the final picture in which the spinons have vanished completely , and traces of them might not be present even at high energies . in the picture without instantons , spinons may be still confined , due to the long range nature of the gauge field . a situation in which this works out@xcite is the 1 + 1d @xmath9 model ( @xmath300 ) , in which integrating out the matter field ( @xmath10-field ) generates a kinetic term ( self energy ) for the gauge field @xmath301 that gives rise to the linearly confining coulomb potential ( _ i.e. _ @xmath302 ) between the @xmath10-charges . in our 2 + 1d problem ( sec.iii.c ) , at a crude level , the dynamical mass generation will have a feedback effect on the gauge field , softening the gauge propagator from @xmath303 to @xmath304 , making it look like a genuine electromagnetic field . in 2 + 1d ,",
    "the coulomb potential associated with electromagnetic field is weakly ( marginally ) confining ( @xmath305)@xcite , and for distances \\{energies } shorter \\{higher } than some scale @xmath306 \\{@xmath307 } , the spinon might be `` visible '' . within the framework of sec.iii.c , to see if there are well - defined spinons , we can study whether the minkowski - space green s function of the spinons has a pole at some mass scale .",
    "if the dynamical symmetry breaking occurred in such a way that the spinons acquire a constant mass as in the njl model@xcite , then the spinons should exist at high energies , and we might be able to `` see '' them@xcite by a method analogous to the 1d example@xcite . if the symmetry is broken by ( long - range , retarded ) gauge field interactions as in our case ,",
    "the problem is quite complicated ; we need to continue the mass function @xmath235 from the euclidean space to the minkowski space ( @xmath308 ) , and examine whether @xmath309 has a solution near the real axis .",
    "the results from the literature@xcite indicate that when the `` feedback '' effect of the spinon mass generation on the vacuum polarization is taken into account ( in which case the gauge field dynamics looks like @xmath310 ) , no poles are found near the real axis .    at present , it is not clear which picture ( _ i.e. _ with or without instantons ) of confinement is realized for the undoped cuprates . in the normal state of the underdoped cuprates ,",
    "instantons are probably not relevant , as we have massless fermions and there are additional massless fluctuations due to the introduction of holes . in any case , the unusual phenomenology of high @xmath0  cuprates points to that the spinons and holons are deconfined , as emphasized earlier .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the issue of possible confinement in the superconducting state .      in this paper",
    "we have examined the magnetism of undoped and underdoped cuprates from the point of view of neutral fermions with spin 1/2@xcite . admittedly , the theory as it stands is far from rigorous .",
    "the philosophy has been to analyze possibly the simplest effective field theory of massless dirac fermions , bosons and gauge fields , motivated by the sflux phase that appears as a saddle point solution of the su(2 ) mean field theory . in reality , the situation is a lot more complicated .",
    "the mean field fermion spectrum is anisotropic : @xmath311 , and the velocities @xmath312 have some doping and temperature dependences .",
    "these dependences , however , do not account for the puzzling properties of the cuprates that we have discussed , and the photoemission does indicate that the quasiparticle gap remains large in the normal state of the underdoped cuprates ( _ i.e. _ superconducting transition is not a gap - closing transition ) and the gap is only weakly doping dependent . therefore , the effective theory may be quite sensible for studying qualitative features not captured by mean field theories .",
    "we have made a number of approximations to treat the complicated dynamics of the gauge fields , but we hope it s not _ too _ optimistic to view that the qualitative conclusions are correct . in any case , the idea that the holon coupling to the gauge field prevents spontaneous symmetry breaking in the fermion system is an attractive one , and is very much in the spirit of the empirical fact that moving holes quickly destroy antiferromagetic order .",
    "unfortunately , even with simplifications , the calculations quickly become rather intractable .",
    "eventually the `` spin gap '' has to close up as we go to the optimally doped regime , which in the mean field theory is modelled by the urvb saddle point@xcite .",
    "the details of this crossover is certainly beyond our hopes .",
    "this will severely limit us in considering some very interesting issues , like the relation between the neutron scattering peaks in the underdoped cuprates and the sharp 41mev peak in the superconducting phase of the optimally doped @xmath313 .",
    "anyway , the present theory does not say much about the spin excitations _ in the superconducting state _ of the underdoped cuprates , since the dynamics of gauge field in the superconducting state is different from that considered here .",
    "another drawback is that in our framework it is not easy to consider possible incommensurate features in spin excitations .    granting these limitations",
    ", we still feel that the picture of spin excitations in underdoped cuprates in terms of deconfined fermionic spinons is reasonable and perhaps more natural than other descriptions like those based on fluctuating staggered moments .",
    "features like the linear - in-@xmath314 behavior of uniform susceptiblity and the specific heat coefficient in underdoped cuprates might be also explanable in terms of the `` quantum critical '' regime of the nonlinear sigma model , but it is not clear in that approach how to account for the strange behavior of the copper @xmath11 in the same temperature range .",
    "attempts to explain the copper @xmath11 in terms of the `` quantum disordered '' regime then has to explain why activated behaviors are not seen in quantities like uniform susceptibility .",
    "again , this seems to point to the difficulty of achieving a theoretical description of a system that involves a mysterious combination of gaplike ( short range ) correlations and critical correlations .",
    "we would like to thank x .- g . wen for collaborating on an earlier project that led to this work , and for many helpful conversations . helpful discussions or correspondences with a. furusaki , f. d. m. haldane , d. a. ivanov , c. mudry , n. nagaosa , k. rajagopal , s. sachdev , and o. syljuasen , are also gratefully acknowledged .",
