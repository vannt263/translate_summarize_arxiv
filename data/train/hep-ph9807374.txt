    "the axion @xcite was postulated approximately twenty years ago to explain why the strong interactions conserve the discrete symmetries p and cp in spite of the fact that the standard model of particle interactions as a whole violates those symmetries .",
    "it is the quasi - nambu - goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath9 symmetry which peccei and quinn postulated . at zero temperature the axion mass is given by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnitude of the vacuum expectation value that breaks @xmath9 and @xmath12 is a strictly positive integer that describes the color anomaly of @xmath9 .",
    "axion models have @xmath12 degenerate vacua @xcite .",
    "searches for the axion in high energy and nuclear physics experiments have only produced negative results . by combining the constraints from these experiments with those from astrophysics @xcite ,",
    "one obtains the following bound : @xmath13 ev .",
    "the axion owes its mass to non - perturbative qcd effects . in the very early universe , at temperatures",
    "high compared to the qcd scale , these effects are suppressed @xcite and the axion mass is negligible .",
    "the axion mass turns on when the temperature approaches the qcd scale and increases till it reaches the value given in eq.(1.1 ) which is valid below the qcd scale .",
    "there is a critical time @xmath14 , defined by @xmath15 , when the axion mass effectively turns on @xcite .",
    "the corresponding temperature @xmath16 gev .",
    "the implications of the existence of an axion for the history of the early universe may be briefly described as follows . at a temperature of order @xmath11",
    ", a phase transition occurs in which the @xmath9 symmetry becomes spontaneously broken .",
    "this is called the pq phase transition . at that time",
    "axion strings appear as topological defects .",
    "one must distinguish two cases : 1 ) inflation occurs with reheat temperature higher than the pq transition temperature ( equivalently , for the purposes of this paper , inflation does not occur at all ) or 2 ) inflation occurs with reheat temperature less than the pq transition temperature .    in case 2 ) the axion field gets homogenized by inflation and the axion strings are ` blown away ' . when the axion mass turns on at @xmath14 , the axion field starts to oscillate .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation is determined by how far from zero the axion field is when the axion mass turns on .",
    "the axion field oscillations do not dissipate into other forms of energy and hence contribute to the cosmological energy density today @xcite .",
    "such a contribution is called of  vacuum realignment \" .",
    "note that the vacuum realignment contribution may be accidentally suppressed in case 2 ) because the axion field , which has been homogenized by inflation , may happen to lie close to zero .    in case 1 ) the axion strings radiate axions @xcite from the time of the pq transition till @xmath14 when the axion mass turns on . at @xmath14",
    "each string becomes the boundary of @xmath12 domain walls .",
    "if @xmath0 , the network of walls bounded by strings is unstable @xcite and decays away .",
    "all of the present paper except section vi is concerned with this process , how many axions are produced in the decay , what is the velocity dispersion of these axions and what are the implications .    if @xmath7 there is a domain wall problem @xcite because axion domain walls end up dominating the energy density , resulting in a universe very different from the one observed today .",
    "there is a way to avoid the domain wall problem by introducing an interaction which slightly lowers one of the @xmath12 vacua with respect to the others . in that case ,",
    "the lowest vacuum takes over after some time and the domain walls disappear .",
    "there is little room in parameter space for that to happen but it is a logical possibility .",
    "section vi discusses this in detail .    in case 1 ) there are three contributions to the axion cosmological energy density .",
    "one contribution @xcite is from axions that were radiated by axion strings before @xmath14 ; let us call it the string decay contribution .",
    "a second contribution is from axions that were produced in the decay of walls bounded by strings after @xmath14 @xcite ; call it the contribution from wall decay .",
    "a third contribution is from vacuum realignment @xcite . to convince oneself that there is a vacuum realignment contribution distinct from the other two , consider a region of the universe which happens to be free of strings and domain walls .",
    "in such a region the axion field is generally different from zero , even though no strings or walls are present .",
    "after time @xmath14 , the axion field oscillates implying a contribution to the energy density which is neither from string decay nor wall decay",
    ". since the axion field oscillations caused by vacuum realignment , string decay and wall decay are mutually incoherent , the three contributions to the energy density should simply be added to each other @xcite .    that axions walls bounded by strings decay predominantly into barely relativistic axions was suggested in ref.@xcite , where the size of the wall contribution to the axion energy density was estimated to be of the same order of magnitude as that from string decay and from vacuum realignment .",
    "this is consistent with what we find here .",
    "d.  lyth @xcite also discussed the wall decay contribution and emphasized the uncertainties affecting it .",
    "m.  nagasawa and m.  kawasaki @xcite performed computer simulations of the decay of walls bounded by string and obtained @xmath17 for the average energy of the radiated axions .",
    "our simulations , presented in section iv , are similar to those of nagasawa and kawasaki but they are done on larger lattices and for a wider variety of initial conditions .",
    "we obtain @xmath18 for @xmath2 .",
    "we attribute the difference between our result and that of nagasawa and kawasaki to the fact that we give angular momentum to the collapsing walls , whereas they did not .",
    "it should be emphasized that the lattice sizes which are amenable to present day computers are at any rate small compared to what one would ideally wish .",
    "indeed the axion string core has size of order @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a coupling constant ( see section [ wbs ] ) whereas the axion domain wall thickness is of order @xmath21 .",
    "the lattice constant must be smaller than @xmath22 for the lattice to resolve the string core .",
    "on the other hand the lattice size must be larger than @xmath21 to contain at least one wall .",
    "hence the lattice size in units of the lattice constant must be of order @xmath23 or larger if the simulations are done in 2 dimensions ( see section [ sos ] ) .",
    "present day computers allow lattice sizes of order @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 . in axion models of interest @xmath26 .",
    "the computer simulations inform us about the situation of interest only insofar it may be assumed that the motion and decay of walls bounded by strings do not vary dramatically from the case where @xmath27 is large to the case where @xmath27 is huge . to address this issue",
    ", we study the dependence of @xmath28 upon the @xmath29 and find that it increases approximately as the logarithm of that quantity over the range accessible to the simulations .",
    "this behaviour is understood in terms of the process by which the walls bounded by string decay .",
    "if it persists all the way up to @xmath30 , then @xmath28 is of order 60 in models of interest .",
    "there has been disagreement in the literature about the size of the string contribution .",
    "many authors @xcite believe it is about a factor 100 larger than the vacuum realignment contribution .",
    "we ourselves @xcite have argued that the string and vacuum realignment contributions are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the two different estimates are presented in subsection iiib . with regard to the wall contribution",
    ", we argue that it is again of the same order of magnitude as that from vacuum realignment , with however large uncertainties .",
    "section iii presents a unified treatment of all contributions .",
    "the resulting axion cosmological energy density is obtained in subsection iiid .",
    "the requirement that it does not overclose the universe , implies @xmath31 ev . by combining this bound with the one from stellar evolution mentioned earlier ,",
    "the axion mass is constrained to lie in the window : @xmath32ev @xmath33 ev .",
    "we find that the velocity dispersion of the axions from wall decay is much larger , by a factor of @xmath6 or so , than the velocity dispersion of the axions from string decay and vacuum realignment .",
    "this has interesting implications for the formation and evolution of axion mini - clusters @xcite as discussed in section v. we find that the axions from wall decay bind only very loosely to axion mini - clusters and that they get readily stripped off when the mini - cluster falls into a galactic halo .",
    "this ensures the existence of an unclustered component of galactic axion dark matter .",
    "the existence of such a component is important for searches of axion dark matter on earth @xcite because it guarantees that the signal is on at all times .",
    "another interesting consequence of the larger velocity dispersion of the axions from wall decay is that it may conceivably be measured .",
    "if a signal is found in the cavity detector of dark matter axions @xcite , the energy spectrum of these axions can be measured with great resolution .",
    "it has been pointed out that there are peaks in the spectrum @xcite because late infall of cold dark matter onto our galaxy produces distinct flows , each one with a characteristic local velocity vector .",
    "these peaks are broadened by the primordial velocity dispersion .",
    "the minimum time required to measure the primordial velocity dispersion of axions from vacuum realignment and string decay is too long ( @xmath34  years ) to be practical , but the minimum time required to measure that of axions from wall decay is much less .",
    "this is discussed in subsection iiie .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present a toy model which captures all the physics we are interested in .",
    "we discuss the evolution of axion strings in the early universe and the formation of walls bounded by strings at the onset of the qcd phase transition .",
    "we give an estimate of the density of walls at that time . in section iii , we discuss the decay of walls bounded by string and the axion population that results therefrom .",
    "we also discuss the axions from vacuum realignment and from string decay and estimate the total cosmological energy density from these mechanisms . in section iv , we present our numerical simulations of the motion and decay of walls bounded by strings . in section",
    "v , we discuss the effect of axions from wall decay upon the formation and evolution of axion miniclusters . in section",
    "vi , we discuss axion models in which @xmath7 and in which the axion domain wall problem is solved by slightly lowering one of the @xmath12 vacua with respect to the others . in section vii , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the bulk of this paper is concerned with the cosmological properties of @xmath0 axion models .",
    "@xmath0 means that the axion model has a unique vacuum .",
    "the following toy model incorporates the qualitative features of interest to us : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a complex scalar field . when @xmath37 , this model has a @xmath38 global symmetry under which @xmath39 .",
    "it is analogous to the @xmath9 symmetry of peccei and quinn .",

    "( [ 2.5 ] ) describes a domain wall which interpolates between neighboring vacua in the low energy effective theory ( [ vi2 ] ) . in the original theory ( [ vi1 ] ) ,",
    "the domain wall interpolates between the unique vacuum back to that same vacuum going around the bottom of the mexican hat potential @xmath60 once .",
    "the thickness of the wall is of order @xmath21 .",
    "the wall energy per unit surface is @xmath61 in the toy model . in reality",
    "the structure of axion domain walls is more complicated than in the toy model , mainly because not only the axion field but also the neutral pion field is spatially varying inside the wall @xcite .",
    "when this is taken into account , the ( zero temperature ) wall energy / surface is found to be : @xmath62 with @xmath63 . for @xmath0 , @xmath64 and @xmath11 are the same .",
    "however , written in terms of @xmath64 , eq . ( 2.6 ) is valid for @xmath65 also .    when @xmath66 , each string becomes the boundary of a domain wall . indeed",
    "the presence of the string forces @xmath67 to vary by @xmath68 when @xmath69 goes around the string once and a domain wall is the minimum energy path that does this .",
    "1 shows a cross - section of a wall bounded by a string .",
    "two different length scales are involved : the wall thickness @xmath21 and the string core size @xmath70 .",
    "walls bounded by string are of course topologically unstable .    in the early universe ,",
    "the axion is essentially massless from the pq phase transition at temperature of order @xmath11 to the qcd phase transition at temperature of order @xmath71 gev . during that epoch ,",
    "axion strings are present as topological defects . at first the strings",
    "are stuck in the plasma and are stretched by the hubble expansion .",
    "however with time the plasma becomes more dilute and below temperature @xcite @xmath72 the strings move freely and decay efficiently into axions . because this decay mechanism is very efficient",
    ", there is approximately one string per horizon from temperature @xmath73 to temperature @xmath74 gev when the axion acquires mass .",
    "the decay of axion strings into axions has been discussed extensively in the literature and is reviewed in subsection [ sd ] .    at temperature @xmath75",
    "each string becomes the boundary of a domain wall .",
    "walls not bounded by string are also present .",
    "we want to obtain statistical properties of this network of walls and strings under the assumption that the axion field is randomly oriented from one horizon to the next just before the axion mass turns on at time @xmath14 .",
    "in particular : what are the average densities of walls and of strings ? are there walls of extent which are not cut up by any string ?",
    "what is the energy fraction in walls not cut up by string ?    to address such questions , a cross - section of a finite but statistically significant volume of the universe near time @xmath14",
    "was simulated in the following manner @xcite .",
    "hexagonal grid was constructed .",
    "each hexagon represents a causally disconnected region .",
    "the circle @xmath76 is divided into three equal parts as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath77 is at the middle of part 1 .",
    "@xmath78 is at the boundary between parts 2 and 3 .",
    "each hexagon is then randomly assigned a number 1 , 2 or 3 .",
    "a hexagon to which # 1 is assigned is thought of as a horizon volume in which the average value of @xmath79 is in part 1 of the circle , and so on .",
    "thus there is a domain wall at each boundary between two hexagons one of which has been assigned # 2 and the other # 3 . likewise there is an downward - going string at each vertex surrounded by hexagons to which # 1 , # 2 and # 3 have been assigned in clockwise order , and a upward - going string at each vertex surrounded by hexagons to which # 1 , # 2 and # 3 have been assigned in counter - clockwise order .",
    "2b shows some examples .",
    "3 shows a larger realization with the underlying grid removed .",
    "3 shows that there are no infinite domain walls which are not cut up by any string .",
    "the reason for this is simple .",
    "an extended domain wall has some probability to be cut up by string in each successive horizon it traverses .",
    "the probability that no string is encountered after traveling a distance @xmath80 along the wall decreases exponentially with @xmath80 .",
    "3 also shows that finite domain walls which are not cut up by string , and which therefore close onto themselves like a sphere or a donut , are very rare .",
    "indeed , the figure shows only one closed circle and a circle need not be a section of a sphere ; it could be a section of a tube .",
    "the average density of walls at time @xmath14 predicted by the random process described here is approximately 2/3 per horizon volume .",
    "this is consistent with fig .",
    "in this section , we discuss the various contributions to the cosmological energy density in the form of _ cold _ axions .",
    "in addition to cold axions , there is a thermal axion population whose properties are derived by the usual application of statistical mechanics to the early , high temperature universe @xcite .",
    "the contribution of thermal axions to the cosmological energy density is subdominant if @xmath13 ev .",
    "we concern ourselves only with cold axions here .",
    "we distinguish the following sources of cold axions : + 1 .",
    "vacuum realignment + a. `` zero momentum '' mode + b. higher momentum modes + 2 .",
    "axion string decay + 3 .",
    "axion domain wall decay + the basis for distinguishing the contribution from vacuum realignment from the other two is that it is present for any quasi - nambu - goldstone field regardless of the topological structures associated with that field .",
    "contributions 1a and lb are distinguished by whether the misalignment of the axion field from the cp conserving direction is in modes of wavelength larger ( 1a ) or shorter ( 1b ) than the horizon size @xmath14 at the moment the axion mass turns on .",
    "contribution 2 is from the decay of axion strings before the qcd phase transition .",
    "contribution 3 is from the decay of axion domain walls bounded by strings after the qcd phase transition . in the past literature on the axion cosmological energy density ,",
    "contributions 1a and 2 have been discussed in detail whereas contributions 1b and 3 have received much less attention .",
    "this section presents a systematic analysis of all contributions .",
    "let us track the axion field from the pq phase transition , when @xmath9 gets spontaneously broken and the axion appears as a nambu - goldstone boson , to the qcd phase transition when the axion acquires mass .",
    "for clarity of presentation we consider in this subsection a large region which happens to be free of axion strings .",
    "although such a region is rare in practice it may exist in principle . in it ,",
    "the contribution to the cosmological axion energy density from string and domain wall decay vanishes but that from vacuum realignment does not . in more typical regions where strings are present",
    ", the contributions from string and domain wall decay should simply be added to that from vacuum realignment .    in the radiation dominated era under consideration , the space - time metric is given by : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the age of the universe , @xmath83 are co - moving coordinates and @xmath84 is the scale factor .",
    "the axion field @xmath85 satisfies : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the time - dependent axion mass .",
    "we will see that the axion mass is unimportant as long as @xmath88 , a condition which is satisfied throughout except at the very end when @xmath82 approaches @xmath14 .",
    "the solution of eq .",

    "( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) show that the wavelength @xmath93 of each mode is stretched by the hubble expansion .",
    "there are two qualitatively different regimes in the evolution of each mode depending on whether its wavelength is outside @xmath94 or inside @xmath95 the horizon .    for @xmath96 ,",
    "only the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ 3.4 ] ) are important and the most general solution is : @xmath97 thus , for wavelengths larger than the horizon , each mode goes to a constant ; the axion field is so - called `` frozen by causality '' .    for @xmath98 , the first three terms in eq .",
    "( [ 3.4 ] ) are important .",
    "let @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath100 where @xmath101 since @xmath102 , this regime is characterized by the adiabatic invariant @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the oscillation amplitude of @xmath105 .",
    "hence the most general solution is : @xmath106 the energy density and the number density behave respectively as @xmath107 and @xmath108 indicating that the number of axions in each mode is conserved .",
    "this is as expected because the expansion of the universe is adiabatic for @xmath109 .",
    "let us define @xmath110 to be the number density , in physical and frequency space , of axions with wavelength @xmath111 , for @xmath112 .",

    "hence : @xmath117 moreover , the size of @xmath118 for @xmath119 is determined in order of magnitude by the fact that the axion field typically varies by @xmath64 from one horizon to the next .",

    "we argue below that the string will then unzip the wall , and that the energy stored in the wall gets released in the form of barely relativistic axions .",

    "although it shifts the spectrum of gravitational waves to higher frequencies .",
    "another energy dissipation mechanism is drag caused by the reflection of particles in the primordial plasma .",
    "the reflection coefficients between various particles and axion domain walls are discussed in ref .",
    "it was found there that axions which are not highly relativistic have reflection coefficient of order one and that the dominant friction experienced by the oscillating walls is on the fluid of cold axions that were produced by vacuum realignment and string decay .",
    "consider a bent wall of curvature radius of order @xmath14 .",
    "the tension in the wall provides a driving force per unit surface of order @xmath195 whereas reflection of cold axions produces a damping force per unit surface of order @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the velocity of the wall . adding the contributions from vacuum realignment [ eqs .",

    "one concludes that @xmath197 is of order one immediately after @xmath14 and hence that the rate of energy dissipation by friction is @xmath201 which implies : @xmath202 thus energy dissipation by friction is important just after the domain walls appear but this mechanism soon turns off as the universe becomes dilute .",
    "if emission of gravitational radiation and friction on the cold axion fluid were the only important dissipation mechanisms , the conclusion would be that a typical wall , whether or not bounded by string , loses a large fraction of its energy by friction immediately after @xmath14 and then lives till a time of order @xmath203 when it decays into gravitons .",

    "this seems an implausibly large number considering that nothing forbids the wall from decaying into axions instead .",
    "it is especially implausible when one considers that at each oscillation a wall bounded by string may self - intersect with reconnection producing two smaller walls bounded by string . if the two pieces produced by an intersection with reconnection are typically of roughly equal size it takes only @xmath205 iterations of this process for the size of the pieces to go down from @xmath14 to the thickness @xmath21 of the walls .",
    "pieces of size @xmath21 surely decay into axions because their dynamics is dominated by the energy of the strings and strings are known to decay into axions efficiently .",

    "the contribution from wall decay is subdominant relative to that from vacuum realignment .",

    "each string becomes the boundary of @xmath12 walls . for a brief period",
    "the walls lose energy by friction against the primordial plasma but this dissipation process is soon turned off as the plasma becomes dilute .",

    "to get rid of the walls , we add to the model a tiny @xmath374 breaking term which lifts the vacuum degeneracy completely , e.g. : @xmath385 where @xmath386 is the pq field with the `` mexican hat '' potential , at the bottom of which @xmath387 . on the rhs of eq.(6.2 )",

    "we have discussed the fate of the walls bounded by strings which appear during the qcd phase transition in axion models with @xmath0 assuming the axion field is not homogenized by inflation . we have argued that the main decay mechanism of these objects is radiation of barely relativistic axions and that the decay takes place during or soon after the qcd phase transition .",
    "we presented the results of our computer simulations of the motion and decay of walls bounded by strings . in the simulations , the walls decay immediately , i.e. in a time scale of order the light travel time .",
    "the computer simulations also provide an estimate of the average energy of the axions emitted in the decay of the walls : @xmath1 when @xmath411 .    because of restrictions on the available lattice sizes , the simulations are for values of @xmath412 of order 100 , whereas in axion models of interest",
    "@xmath412 is of order @xmath413 . to address this shortcoming ,",
    "we have investigated the dependence of @xmath414 upon @xmath415 and found that it increases approximately as the logarithm of this quantity .",
    "this is because the decay process occurs in two steps : 1 ) wall energy converts into moving string energy because the wall accelerates the string , and the energy spectrum hardens accordingly ; 2 ) the strings annihilate into axions without qualitative change in the energy spectrum .",
    "if this behaviour persists all the way to @xmath416 , then @xmath417 for axion models of interest .    to parameterize our ignorance of the decay process we introduced two parameters : the time @xmath218 when the decay effectively takes place and the average lorentz factor @xmath418 of the radiated axions at time @xmath218 .",
    "we found that in first approximation the cosmological energy density of axions from wall decay does not depend upon @xmath218 whereas it is inversely proportional to @xmath220 .",

    "this has interesting consequences for the formation and evolution of axion miniclusters .",
    "we showed that the qcd horizon scale density perturbations in pop.ii axions get erased by free streaming before the time @xmath322 of equality between radiation and matter whereas those in pop.i axions do not .",
    "ii axions form an unclustered component of the axion cosmological energy density which guarantees that the signal in direct searches for axion dark matter is on all the time .",
    "we speculated that the velocity dispersion of axions from wall decay may be large enough to be measured in a cavity detector of dark matter axions .",
    "this would provide a direct experimental handle on some of the issues raised by axion cosmology , e.g. the question whether inflation occurred below or above the pq phase transition .",
    "finally we discussed the cosmology of axion models with @xmath7 in which the axion domain wall problem is solved by postulating a small u@xmath8(1 ) breaking interaction which slightly lowers one of the @xmath12 vacua with respect to the others .",
    "there is very little room in parameter space for this to work but it is a logical possibility .",
