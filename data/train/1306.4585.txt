    "thanks to the rapid localization of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , the response of ground - based observations of grb afterglows has been greatly enhanced and observations of grb afterglows have become routinely possible within minutes after the explosion .",
    "very early afterglow data are required to estimate the initial bulk lorentz factor of the ejecta @xcite , probe the physical composition of the outflow @xcite , and constrain the density profile of the medium surrounding the progenitor @xcite .",
    "late afterglow observations provide us with clues on the medium density profile , which , in turn , may provide hints on the nature of the progenitor star .",
    "the idea that supernova ( sn ) explosions may also produce energetic gamma - ray emission by some mechanism goes back to @xcite , but the first piece of evidence supporting such a connection was not found until 1998 @xcite . the connection was finally established in 2003 when sn2003dh and sn2003lw were unambiguously detected spectroscopically following the nearby grb030329 and grb031203 , respectively @xcite .",

    "we were able to detect a sn component in the late afterglow of grb081007 .",
    "grb081007 triggered the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard _ swift _ on 2008 october 7 at 05:23:52 ut .",
    "it was a long grb with a peak @xmath5  s duration in the 15 - 350 kev gamma - ray band @xcite .",
    "this burst also triggered the gamma - ray burst monitor , onboard _ fermi _ , in the 25 - 900 kev gamma - ray band .",
    "the prompt emission consisted of a single pulse with an estimated duration @xmath6 of about 12  s @xcite .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite immediately slewed to the field and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) started observations at 99 and 108  s after the trigger , leading to a detection of the x - ray and optical afterglows @xcite .",
    "gemini - south took two 900  s spectra , starting 73 minutes after the burst .",
    "two absorption lines at 6016.7 and 6070.3  and an emission line at 5700.9  were identified as h , k and [ ] 3727  lines respectively at @xmath7 ( * ? ? ?",

    "xrt and uvot started observations 85 and 91  s after the trigger and detected the x - ray and optical afterglow @xcite .",
    "gemini - south took two 1200  s spectra , starting 11.7  hr after the burst , and found that grb090424 is at @xmath8 , similar to grb081007 ( * ? ? ?",

    "<S> there is no supernova component detected in the afterglow of grb090424 , likely because of the brightness of the host galaxy , comparable to the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the afterglow data are consistent with the presence of both forward- and reverse - shock emission powered by relativistic outflows expanding into the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of optical peaks due to the forward shock strongly suggests that the reverse - shock regions should be mildly magnetized . </S>",
    "<S> the initial lorentz factor of outflow of grb081007 is estimated to be @xmath0 , while for grb090424 a lower limit of @xmath1 is derived . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the prompt emission of grb081007 , which consists of just a single pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that neither the external forward - shock model nor the shock - breakout model can account for the prompt emission data and suggest that the single - pulse - like prompt emission may be due to magnetic energy dissipation of a poynting - flux - dominated outflow or to a dissipative photosphere . </S>"
