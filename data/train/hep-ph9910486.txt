    "deviations from the standard model ( sm ) caused by new physics characterized by very high mass scales @xmath8 can systematically be studied at lower energies by using the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the effects of the new physics can be observed at energies well - below @xmath8 , and can be related to some effective contact interaction @xcite . in the framework of composite models of leptons and quarks ,",
    "the contact interaction is regarded as a remnant of the binding force between the fermion substructure constituents .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath6 collisions , many types of new physics , for which the exchanged particles in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 channels have mass - squared much larger than the corresponding mandelstam invariant variables , can be described by an effective @xmath12 contact term in the interaction lagrangian @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , effects of a @xmath0 boson of a few tev mass scale would be well - represented by a four - fermion contact interaction .",
    "the exchange of a leptoquark of a similar mass scale could be described by an effective @xmath13 contact term in the relevant interaction . at energies",
    "much lower than the sparticle masses , @xmath1-parity breaking interactions introduce effective @xmath14 and @xmath13 interactions .",
    "thus , quite generally , the contact interaction is considered as a convenient parameterization of deviations from the sm that may be caused by some new physics at the large scale  @xmath8 .",
    "fermion - pair production in @xmath6 collisions @xmath15 ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) is one of the basic processes of the sm , and deviations of the measured observables from the predicted values would be a first indication of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the lowest - order four - fermion contact terms have dimension @xmath18 , which implies that they are suppressed by @xmath19 . restricting the fermion currents to be helicity conserving and flavor diagonal , the general @xmath20 invariant four - fermion @xmath12 contact interaction lagrangian with @xmath18",
    "can be written as @xcite@xcite : @xmath21 , \\label{lagra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where generation and color indices have been suppressed .",

    "( [ lagra ] ) defines eight independent , individual interaction models corresponding to the combinations of the four chiralities ll , lr , rl and rr with the @xmath26 signs of the @xmath27 s . in practice",
    ", the true interaction might correspond to one of these models or to any combination of them . here , we will perform a model - independent analysis of the contact interactions .    in principle , the sought - for deviations of observables from the sm predictions , giving information on @xmath8 s , simultaneously depend on all four - fermion effective coupling constants in eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) , which therefore can not be easily disentangled . for simplicity",
    ", the analysis is usually performed by taking a non - zero value for only one parameter at a time , all the remaining ones being put equal to zero .",
    "limits on individual @xmath13 contact interaction parameters have recently been derived by this procedure , from a global analysis of the relevant data @xcite , and the individual models are severely constrained , with @xmath28 tev . however , if several terms of different chiralities were simultaneously taken into account , cancellations may occur and the resulting bounds on @xmath29 would be considerably weaker , of the order of @xmath30 tev .",
    "consequently , a definite improvement of the situation in this regard should be obtained from a procedure of analyzing experimental data that allows to account for the various contact interaction couplings simultaneously as free parameters , and yet to obtain in a model - independent way separate bounds for the corresponding @xmath8 s , not affected by possible accidental cancellations . in this paper",
    "we shall propose an analysis of @xmath14 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 contact interactions at the next linear @xmath6 collider with @xmath33 gev and with longitudinally polarized beams .",
    "our approach makes use of two particular , polarized , integrated cross sections @xmath34 and @xmath35 , that are directly connected , _ via _ linear combinations , to the helicity cross sections of process ( [ proc ] ) , and therefore allow to deal with a minimal set of independent free parameters .",
    "this kind of observables , defined for specific kinematical cuts , were already introduced to study @xmath0 signals at lep2 and lc @xcite and potential manifestations of compositeness at the lc @xcite . here ,",
    "we extend the previous considerations by performing a general analysis where , in the definition of the above - mentioned integrated observables , we choose suitable kinematical regions where the sensitivity to individual four - fermion contact interaction parameters is maximal .",
    "also , an application of the proposed approach to @xmath0 searches at lc is discussed where , in particular , the constraints on the relevant parameters are derived .    in the born approximation ,",

    "such sensitivity numerically determines the bounds on the contact - interaction scales @xmath29 that can be derived from the experimental data and , basically , is determined by the comparison of deviations from the sm predictions due to the contact - interaction terms with the attainable experimental uncertainty .",
    "accordingly , we define the ` significance ' of each helicity cross section by the ratio : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the deviation from the sm prediction , dominated for @xmath106 by the interference term : @xmath107 and @xmath108 is the expected experimental uncertainty on @xmath64 , combining statistical and systematic uncertainties .    for example , adding uncertainties in quadrature , the uncertainty on @xmath86 , indirectly measured _ via _ @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see eqs .",

    "numerically , in the situation of small deviations from the sm we are considering , we can use to a very good approximation the sm predictions for the cross sections @xmath114 to assess the expected @xmath115 and therefore of the uncertainties @xmath108 in the denominator of ( [ signif ] ) . basically , the directly measured integrated cross sections @xmath114 of eqs .  ( [ sigma1 ] ) and ( [ sigma2 ] ) and , correspondingly , the uncertainties @xmath108 , are dependent on the value of @xmath95 , which can be considered in general as an input parameter related to given experimental conditions ( see , _ e.g. _ , eq .",
    "( [ uncet ] ) ) . since the deviation @xmath105 of eq .",
    "( [ deltasig ] ) is independent of @xmath95 , the full sensitivity of a given helicity cross section to the relevant contact - interaction parameter is determined by the corresponding size and @xmath95 behavior of the uncertainty @xmath108 .",
    "then , the optimization would be obtained by choosing for @xmath95 the value @xmath116 where the uncertainty @xmath108 becomes minimum , _",
    "i.e. _ , where the corresponding sensitivity eq .",
    "( [ signif ] ) has a maximum . as anticipated , we estimate the required @xmath95 behavior from the known sm cross sections .",
    "combining , again in quadrature , statistical and systematic uncertainties on @xmath114 , we have : @xmath117 numerically , for @xmath114 we take into account the expected identification efficiencies , @xmath118 @xcite and the systematic uncertainties , @xmath119 , on the various fermionic final states , for which we assume : for leptons : @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; for @xmath122 quarks : @xmath123 and @xmath124 ; for @xmath125 quarks : @xmath126 and @xmath127 . as concerns the systematic uncertainty , we assume the same @xmath119 for @xmath128 , and independent of @xmath95 in the relevant angular range .",
    "we consider the lc with the following options : @xmath7  tev , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we assume half the total integrated luminosity quoted above for both values of the electron polarization , @xmath83 . as an example",
    ", the relative uncertainties , @xmath132 , on the helicity cross sections for the process @xmath133 , are shown as functions of @xmath95 in fig .  1 .",
    "the optimal kinematical parameters @xmath116 where the sensitivity of leptonic process is a maximum , can easily be obtained from this figure .",
    "the corresponding dependences for quark final states are analogous .    in order to assess the increase of sensitivity obtained by optimization",
    ", one should compare the corresponding uncertainties at @xmath116 with those obtained without optimization , at @xmath79 of eq .",
    "( [ zpm ] ) .",
    "fig .  1 , show that , in the ll and rr cases , optimization results in a rather modest increase of sensitivity and of the corresponding discovery limits on @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( by a few percent ) , since the @xmath95 behavior of the uncertainty is rather flat .",
    "conversely , in the lr and rl cases optimization can substantially increase the sensitivity and the corresponding reachable lower bounds on @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( up to a factor of about 2 for the @xmath138 case ) .",
    "the bounds on the contact interaction parameters can be obtained by using @xmath139 procedure . in the numerical analysis",
    "presented below , we take three different values of the polarization , @xmath140 1 , 0.8 , 0.5 , in order to study this dependence .",
    "this is a reasonable variation around the value @xmath130 expected at the lc @xcite .",
    ".contact - interaction reach ( in tev ) at an @xmath6 linear collider with @xmath141  tev and @xmath142 , at 95% c.l .",
    "radiative corrections are included , with a cut on the energy of photons emitted in the initial state .",
    "the arrows indicate the increase of sensitivity of the observables caused by the optimization . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab1 ]    table  1 shows that the helicity cross sections @xmath64 are quite sensitive to contact interactions , with discovery limits ranging from 40 to 80 times the cm energy at the degree of electron polarization @xmath130 .",
    "the best sensitivity occurs for the @xmath4 final state , while the worst one is for @xmath5 . decreasing the electron polarization from @xmath143 to @xmath144 results in a worsening of the sensitivity by @xmath145 , depending on the final state .",
    "regarding the role of the assumed uncertainties on the observables under consideration , in the cases of @xmath136 and @xmath137 the expected statistics are such that the uncertainty turns out to be dominated by the statistical one , and the results have little sensitivity to the value of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "conversely , in the cases of @xmath135 and @xmath134 the results depend more sensitively on the assumed value of the systematic uncertainty . moreover , as is evident from eqs .",
    "( [ s+ ] ) and ( [ s- ] ) , a further improvement in the sensitivity to the various @xmath8-scales in table  1 would be obtained if both @xmath146 and @xmath147 longitudinal polarizations were available .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , also the @xmath9-channel exchange of a new , very massive , neutral gauge boson @xmath148 with @xmath149 can be identified to a contact interaction lagrangian of the kind in eq .",
    "( [ lagra ] ) .",
    "specifically , the contribution of the @xmath148-mediated helicity amplitudes , to be added to the sm ones , takes the form : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the @xmath0 propagator , and @xmath152 , @xmath153 are the fermionic couplings of the @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath154 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ amplit ] ) and ( [ amplitz ] ) , one finds @xmath155 thus , in the case of no obrserved signal , i.e. , no deviation of @xmath64 from the sm prediction within the experimental accuracy , at given @xmath156 one can directly obtain model - independent bounds on the fermionic chiral couplings to the @xmath0 from eqs.([amplitz])-([contz ] ) and the constraints listed in table  1 .",
    "if a @xmath0 is indeed discovered , perhaps at a hadron machine , it becomes interesting to measure as accurately as possible its couplings and mass at the lc , and make tests of the various extended gauge models .",
    "another interesting question is the potential of the leptonic process ( [ proc ] ) to identify the @xmath0 model underlying the measured signal , through the measurement of the helicity cross sections , e.g. @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "such cross sections only depend on the relevant leptonic chiral coupling and on @xmath156 , so that such resolving power clearly depends on the actual value of the @xmath0 mass . in figs .",
    "2a and 2b we show this dependence for the @xmath159 and the @xmath160 models of interest here . in these figures ,",
    "the horizontal lines represent the values of the couplings predicted by the various models , and the lines joining the upper and the lower ends of the vertical bars represent the expected experimental uncertainty at the 95% cl .",
    "the intersection of the lower such lines with the @xmath156 axis determines the discovery reach for the corresponding model : larger values of @xmath156 would determine a @xmath0 signal smaller than the experimental uncertainty and , consequently , statistically invisible . also ,",
    "figs .  2a and 2b show the complementary roles of @xmath158 and @xmath157 to set discovery limits : while @xmath158 is mostly sensitive to the @xmath161 and has the smallest sensitivity to the @xmath162 , @xmath157 provides the best limit for the @xmath163 and the worst one for the @xmath161 .    as figs .",
    "2a and 2b show , the different models can be distinguished by means of @xmath44 as long as the uncertainty of the coupling of one model does not overlap with the value predicted by the other model .",
    "thus , the identification power of the leptonic process ( [ proc ] ) is determined by the minimum @xmath156 value at which such ` confusion region ' starts .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "2a shows that the @xmath164 model can not be distinguished from the lr , @xmath165 and @xmath27 models at @xmath0 masses larger than 2165 gev , 2270 gev and 2420 gev , respectively .",
    "the identification power for the typical models are indicated in figs .",
    "2a and 2b by the symbols circle , diamond , square and triangle .    in the case of process ( [ proc ] ) with @xmath166 pair production ( with @xmath167 ) , the analysis is complicated by the fact that the relevant helicity amplitudes depend on three parameters ( @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath156 ) instead of two .",
    "nevertheless , there is still some possibility to derive general information on the @xmath0 chiral couplings to quarks . as an illustrative example , in fig .",
    "3 we depict the bounds from the process @xmath170 in the ( @xmath171,@xmath172 ) and ( @xmath171,@xmath173 ) planes for the @xmath0 of the @xmath164 model , with @xmath174 . taking into account two - fold ambiguity ,",
    "the allowed regions are the ones included within the two sets of hyperbolic contours in the upper - left and in the lower - right corners of fig .",
    "3 . then , to get finite regions for the quark couplings , one must combine the hyperbolic regions so obtained with the determinations of the leptonic @xmath0 couplings from the leptonic process ( [ proc ] ) , represented by the two vertical strips .",
    "the corresponding shaded areas represent the determinations of @xmath172 , while the hatched areas are the determinations of @xmath173 . notice that , in general , there is the alternative possibility of deriving constraints on quark couplings also in the case of right - handed electrons , namely , from the determinations of the pairs of couplings ( @xmath175,@xmath172 ) and ( @xmath175,@xmath173 ) .",
    "however , as observed with regard to the previous analysis of the leptonic process , the sensitivity to the right - handed electron coupling turns out to be smaller than for @xmath171 , so that the corresponding constraints are weaker .",
    "we emphasize that the measurement of the helicity cross sections of the process ( [ proc ] ) with optimal kinematical cuts could substantially increase their sensitivity to contact interaction parameters and could give crucial , model - independent information on the chiral structure of such new interactions .    as an application of the proposed approach at lc , we study the sensitivity to @xmath0 . in the case of no observed signal",
    ", one can directly obtain model - independent bounds on the leptonic chiral couplings of the @xmath0 from @xmath176 and on the products of lepton - quark chiral couplings from @xmath177 ( with @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) . in the case @xmath0 manifestations are observed as deviations from the sm , the role of @xmath64 is more interesting , specially as regards the problem of identifying the various models as potential sources of such non - standard effects .",
    "indeed , in principle , they provide a unique possibility to disentangle and extract numerical values for the chiral couplings of the @xmath0 in a general way , avoiding the danger of cancellations , so that @xmath0 model predictions can be tested .",
