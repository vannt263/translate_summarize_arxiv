    ", it is really whether the state is in- or out - of - phase with the local order parameter that is of importance for the energetics .",

    "it is clear that for @xmath54 , all states below the fermi level are in resonance with the condensate , in natural agreement with the results in fig .",
    "[ figure : phaseaverage2 ] . as the strength of the zeeman term on the wire",
    "is increased , the ysr impurity states are pulled deeper into the gap and towards the fermi level . eventually , these states start to cross the fermi level . each time this happens a state that is in - phase with the condensate",
    "is deoccupied , while another state that is out - of - phase with the condensate becomes occupied .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that the order parameter suddenly decreases at each such fermi level crossing . in fig .",
    "[ figure : d ] we plot the local superconducting order parameter at each site of the wire ( blue lines ) , overlayed on the energy spectrum ( thin black lines ) , and it is clear that the local order parameters indeed exhibit discrete downwards jumps at each fermi level crossing .     as in fig .",

    "this can easily be understood since the wave function of the quasiparticle states have different amplitudes on different sites , and thus its influence on the order parameter is naturally site dependent . at",
    "strong enough zeeman fields the order parameter on the wire changes sign compared to the surrounding bulk condensate and thus there is a local @xmath1-shift concentrated along the ferromagnetic impurity wire . as can be expected from the different sizes of the jumps in the order parameter",

    "we also note that the @xmath1-shift is highly localized to the wire sites , and does not spread even to the neighboring sites .",
    "the @xmath1-shift for a single impurity has previously been found to be of similarly short - ranged character , with an extent that is proportional to the fermi wave length @xmath56.@xcite    we finally also make a note about the change of phase that occurs for the ysr states beyond the fermi level crossing at high @xmath55 , as seen in fig .  [",
    "figure : wire_spectrum ] .",
    "it is clear that the real part of @xmath51 eventually changes sign to that of the condensate again , as the states are pulled deep enough below the fermi level .",
    "naively this change of sign could be expected to give rise to a compensatory upward jump in the order parameter .",
    "however , we remember that @xmath51 is calculated as an average of @xmath57 over the whole sample .",
    "the change in sign here merely reflects that the state in some spatial regions becomes in - phase with the bulk condensate but it can still stay out - of - phase in other regions , which is exactly what happens for the wire sites .",
    "we now turn to the situation where we allow for a finite rashba spin - orbit interaction in the superconductor . for a range of @xmath55 values the wire now enters a non - trivial one - dimensional superconducting topological phase.@xcite the ysr states moving through the energy gap from above and below do not couple to each other when only @xmath0-wave superconductivity and a zeeman term is present .",
    "however , once a rashba spin - orbit interaction is introduced , the states can couple to each other , which tends to push these intragap states away from the fermi level.@xcite as is clearly visible in fig .",

    "this leads to a qualitatively similar decrease in the superconducting order parameter , and the eventual @xmath1-shift with increasing @xmath55 , as for no spin - orbit interaction , except for the absence of the discrete jumps .",
    "the qualitatively similar behavior of the order parameter along the wire is also direct visible in a comparison between fig .",

    "[ figure : d_so ] .",
    "the two states closest to the fermi level in this regime corresponds to the single majorana fermions at the two wire end points , which are here somewhat hybridized due to a short wire length . this can be verified by looking at the probability density of these two states , which is clearly peaked at the wire end points as displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure : lowestenergydensity ] .",
    "we also note that the @xmath1-shift of the superconducting order parameter takes place at significantly higher values of @xmath55 than the topological phase transition , and are therefore not directly related to each other .     at @xmath59 , as indicated by dots in fig .",

    "so far we have focused on the origin and occurrence of the @xmath1-shift of the order parameter at the ferromagnetic impurity sites .",
    "we now finish with an investigation of any possible phase gradients in the superconducting order parameter in the regions surrounding the magnetic wire .",
    "this is particularly relevant as previous work has found persistent currents around ferromagnetic impurities in conventional @xmath0-wave superconductors in the presence of spin - orbit interaction.@xcite we therefore carefully examine the phase of the superconducting order parameter in the whole sample , paying particular attention to not bias the self - consistency procedure to a real solution .",
    "even when starting the self - consistency loop with a complex phase that is randomly varied from site to site over the phase range of @xmath60 , we find _ no _ phase gradients in the whole sample ( apart from the discrete @xmath1-shift on the wire ) , for almost all values of the zeeman exchange field @xmath55 of the impurities .",
    "it is only in a very narrow region in @xmath55-space , just after the whole wire has transitioned into the @xmath1-shifted state , that we find some minor phase gradients in the order parameter .",

    "[ figure : d_complete ] we plot a representative view of the superconducting phase inside this region for zero spin - orbit coupling , but the picture is , even quantitatively , the same for finite spin - orbit coupling . as seen ,",
    "although there is a finite gradient , the difference between the maximum and minimum phase in the region surrounding the wire is less than @xmath61 and is therefore small compared to for example those surrounding a vortex , where the phase of the order parameter twists by a full @xmath62 .",
    "the resulting currents carried by the superconducting condensate is thus necessarily quite small .",
    "moreover , the phase gradient sets the direction of motion of the cooper pairs , with the bright and dark spots in the region surrounding the wire thus corresponding to sinks and sources of the current carried by the condensate . while the total current is continuous , as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , this reflects the fact that only part of the total current is actually carried by the superconducting condensate .",
    "it is true that a phase gradient in the superconducting order parameter gives rise to a current , related to the center of mass motion of the cooper pairs , but this is only one possible part of the total current , as also single quasiparticles can carry current .",
    "thus , the persistent currents found for magnetic impurities in spin - orbit coupled superconductors can according to our results not be related to the superconducting order parameter developing phase gradients ; we only find finite phase gradients in a narrow window of @xmath55 and independent on the presence of spin - orbit coupling , while persistent currents are present for all finite @xmath55 but only for finite spin - orbit coupling .",

    ", we can understand these jumps as a direct consequence of the non - resonating character for initially unoccupied ysr states , which once they are pulled below the fermi level contribute destructively to the order parameter .",

    "<S> it has previously been found that a magnetic impurity in a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor can give rise to a local @xmath1-phase shift of the superconducting order parameter . by studying a finite wire of ferromagnetic impurities , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to trace the origin of the @xmath1-phase shift to a resonance condition for the bogoliubov - de gennes quasiparticle states . </S>",
    "<S> when non - resonating states localized at the impurity sites are pulled into the condensate for increasing magnetic strength , the superconducting order parameter is reduced in discrete steps , eventually resulting in a @xmath1-phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that for a finite spin - orbit coupling , the @xmath1-phase shift is preserved and occurs in a large portion of the topologically non - trivial phase . </S>"
