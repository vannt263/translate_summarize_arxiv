    "the observed periodicities were also interpreted as being due to the oscillations of whole coronal loops .    on the other hand , in many flares qpos with shorter periods , @xmath2s , were observed in hxr emission ( see ) . in the present paper",
    "we would like to show how the investigation of these short - period oscillations can be used to investigate impulsive electron acceleration .    in sect.[obs ]",

    "first , from the _ yohkoh _ hard x - ray telescope catalogue @xcite we selected flares which showed at least three hxr impulses and the time - intervals between the impulses were of similar duration ( see figs.[limb1 ] and [ limb2 ] ) . we have selected about 50 appropriate flares .",

    "we consider three limb flares with periods @xmath10s ( fig.[limb2 ] and table[tab3 ] ) .",
    "all they are high structures ( see the altitudes , @xmath11 , in table[tab3 ] ) and long - duration events ( lde ) .",

    "their sxr images ( grey scale ) together with hxr isophotes are shown in fig.[limb:2ar ] .",
    "the sxr images show that they were big arcade flares .",
    "in particular , very interesting is the large triangular structure seen in the hxr image of the flare no.13 of 30 september 1998 ( see fig.[limb2 ] ) .",
    "the dominant hxr sources , b and c , are located at the altitude of sxr arcade ( see fig.[limb:2ar ] ) .",

    "the two dominant hxr sources , b and c , correspond to the magnetic mirrors , b and c , in fig.[scheme ] .",
    "charged particles spend somewhat longer time ( calculated per unit length along the magnetic trap ) near the magnetic mirrors than in other parts of the trap and therefore the hxr emission is enhanced near the mirrors . the enhanced emission near p and along the line running downwards from p , is due to the fact that plasma density is somewhat higher there because of reconnection stream flowing from the current sheet at p. the higher density increases the hxr emissivity .",
    "we have taken the distance , @xmath8 , between the top source p and the line connecting b and c , as the height of the cusp structure , and calculated the velocity @xmath12 as @xmath13 and then the magnetic field strength @xmath14 from eq.(5 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 calculated from eqs.(1 ) and ( 3 ) , as well as @xmath12 and @xmath14 are given in table[tab3 ] .",
    "flare no.14 of 3 april 2001 is a similar case .",
    "it was also a large arcade flare and the sources b and c were located at the altitude of sxr arcade .",
    "a top hxr source p is seen in _",
    "m1 ( 2333kev ) images which confirms that this is also a similar triangular hxr structure .",
    "hxr footpoint sources are seen on the solar disc , but they are weaker than the b and c sources .",
    "again , we have measured the height of the cusp structure as the distance between the top source p and the line connecting b and c and the obtained values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 are given in table[tab3 ] .    our model ( connection of sources",
    "b and c by a cusp - like structure like in fig.[scheme]b ) explains why in flares nos.13 and 14 the sources b and c are similar in intensity and their time evolution is similar .",
    "figure[limb:2ar ] indicates that in the both flares the plane bpc of the cusp - like structure is not perpendicular to the arcade axis .",
    "this can be due to the shear in footpoint motion at the photosphere ( see fig.3.10 in ) .",
    "the sources b and c are located at the places where cusp - like magnetic lines meet the arcade loops ( the places are located on the opposite sides of the arcade axis ) .",
    "no sxr images were available for the flare no.12 of 2 march 1993 . in the hxr image of this flare ( fig.[limb2 ] )",
    "strong footpoint sources are seen on the solar disc and a triangular structure bpc is seen at the top .",
    "the strong footpoint emission indicates that the oscillations of magnetic traps were more dynamic ( low value of @xmath17 ) and therefore the accelerated electrons could easily escape towards the footpoints .",
    "we have measured the altitude , @xmath11 , and the height , @xmath8 , of the cusp - like structure at the top and obtained values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 , and @xmath14 are given in table[tab3 ] .    in table[tab3 ]",
    "we see that the values of @xmath12 and @xmath14 are similar to those obtained for flares with periods 1060s ( tables[tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] ) .",

    "it should be @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath22 is the temperature .",
    "this gives @xmath23 hence the lower limit for the alfven speed is [ eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 11 ) ] : @xmath24}\\quad\\ ] ] taking @xmath25  k for the temperature in the trap , we obtain @xmath26    we see in tables[tab1][tab3 ] that our estimates of the alfven speed , @xmath12 , are higher than this lower limit , but they are not much higher .",
    "this means that the magnetic pressure , @xmath27 , is not much higher than the gas pressure , @xmath28 , in the acceleration volume .",
    "this is important for mhd modeling of flaring loops .    in fig.[plot ] the diameter , @xmath29 , of the hxr loop - top source",
    "is plotted vs. the oscillation period , @xmath6 . for short periods , @xmath30s ,",
    "good correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath6 is seen .",
    "[ a diagram displaying @xmath11 ( or @xmath31/2 ) vs. @xmath6 shows much larger dispersion .",
    "] this is a confirmation that the investigated oscillations occur in confined magnetic structures displayed as the hxr sources .",
    "this supports our model of the oscillations of magnetic traps in cusp - like magnetic structures .    , and",
    "the oscillation period , @xmath6 . for large sources ( @xmath4s ) the values of @xmath32 were taken for @xmath29  see text .",
    "point marked with a square relates to the flare investigated by ofman & sui ( 2006 )",

    "it appears that the large hxr structures also fit the correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath6 determined by the small structures .",
    "this supports our assumption that the large triangular hxr structures are the cusp - like magnetic structures in which the oscillations with period @xmath4s occur .",
    "have analyzed rhessi observations of qpos in a flare of 19 january 2005 with period @xmath34s .",
    "we have measured the size , @xmath8 , of the hxr loop - top source in the same manner as for our three large _ yohkoh _ flares and we have plotted additional point marked with a square in our test diagram in fig.[plot ] .",
    "we see that this additional flare fits quite well into our model of oscillating magnetic traps",
    ".    it may be important that all four large flares in fig.[plot ] have periods about 140150s , which suggests that they may be overtones of the 300s solar oscillations .",
    "this would mean that the oscillations are maintained due to a resonance with the 300s oscillations .",
    "in particular , this seems to be probable in the case of our flares nos.13 and 14 and the flare investigated by , in which the hxr oscillations are quasi - sinusoidal ( not typical sequences of increasing impulses like in fig.[lc ] ) .    for a number of flares",
    "has found decaying oscillations of periods 5.5@xmath352.7 minutes in doppler shifts of sxr spectral lines .",
    "he explained them as being due to slow - mode or fast magnetosonic oscillations of whole flaring loops .",
    "we have investigated _ yohkoh _ hxr records for those flares and we have found no counterpart of the mariska s oscillations in the hxrs .",
    "mariska s flares were rather small , hence the observed oscillations most probably were the relaxation oscillations of whole flare magnetic structure which were excited by collision of violent chromospheric evaporation upflows .",
    "moreover , for some mariska s flares we have found hxr quasi - periodic oscillations of period 1060s analogous to those investigated in the present paper .",
    "this is an additional indication that the hxr oscillations with periods 1060s occur in smaller volumes and they are different from the longer - period oscillations observed by mariska .",
    "these cases will be investigated in a separate paper .",
    "important information can be obtained from _",
    "cgro_/batse observations due to their high sensitivity in hxrs .",
    "an example of such observations is shown in fig.[img : disk ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "we see that a sequence of weak quasi - periodic impulses began about 23:09ut , but a typical impulsive phase began about 23:14ut .",
    "( similar weak oscillations before the impulsive phase are seen in flare of 2 march 1993 in fig.[limb2 ] ) .",
    "these observations are in agreement with the model of oscillating traps : the oscillations began about 23:09ut .",
    "accelerated particles hit the footpoints and chromospheric evaporation begin .",
    "the plasma moves along the same magnetic lines , connecting traps with footpoints , and about 23:14ut it reaches the oscillating traps . during the expansion of a trap this plasma fills the trap and therefore a larger number of electrons will be accelerated during the next compression of the trap .",
    "hence , there is now a feedback between the number of accelerated electrons and the density of the plasma which reaches the traps .",
    "this feedback causes that the hxr intensity increases with time , as it is seen in fig.[img : disk ] .",
    "hence , the model of oscillating magnetic traps provides a simple explanation of the well - known paradox that the number of electrons , which are accelerated during big flares , is much higher than it can be provided by surrounding corona .",
    "let us repeat that , according to discussion of fig.[img : disk ] , chromospheric evaporation begins a few minutes before the beginning of the impulsive phase .",
    "the beginning of the evaporation causes increase of the sxr emission .",
    "hence , the model of electron acceleration in oscillating magnetic traps is in agreement with the well - known fact that sxr emission of a flare usually begins a few minutes before the beginning of hxr impulsive phase .",
    "thermal conduction also contributes to the energy transport from the loop top to its footpoints during the impulsive phase and it increases the rate of chromospheric evaporation .",
    "our model of oscillating magnetic traps explains very well why the time intervals , @xmath6 , between the hxr impulses are not equal .",
    "the oscillations occur in a volume of changing magnetic field and plasma density , so that the alfven speed can change from one pulse to another .        in the present paper",
    "we have considered a cusp - like magnetic configuration .",
    "we see from this example that two factors are necessary for magnetic - trap compression and excitation of their oscillations : a magnetic - field reconnection and an obstacle ( a transverse magnetic field ) on the way of the reconnection flow .",
    "but the location and orientation of the reconnection site can be different in different flares .",
    "let us note that our model of exciting oscillations of magnetic traps is similar to that proposed for oscillations during onset of magnetospheric substorms .",
    "the substorm begins with a violent reconnection in the magnetospheric tail ( see observations presented by ) .",
    "the reconnection outflow directed earthward collides with the inner ( dipole - like ) magnetic field , causes magnetic field compression and excitation of oscillations .",
    "an example of magnetic field oscillations during the onset of a substorm is shown in fig.[sstorm ] ( a smooth substorm variation of the magnetic field has been removed from these records ) .",
    "we see a short sequence of oscillations which is similar to what we see in hxrs of investigated flares ( the smooth variation of hxr intensity was not removed from our light curves ) .    .",
    "from nishida ( 1978).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "we have investigated flares for which quasi - periodic hxr oscillations and hxr loop - top sources were clearly seen .",
    "our analysis has shown that the observed hxr oscillations are confined within the loop - top sources .",
    "this is supported by a correlation between the periods , @xmath6 , and the sizes , @xmath29 , of the loop - top sources .",
    "has found that oscillations of whole flaring loops had periods of 5.5@xmath352.7 minutes .",
    "recently we have found that hxr oscillations with periods @xmath5s occurred in some of the mariska s flares which confirms that the oscillations seen in hxrs , occurred in smaller magnetic structures ( these results will be presented in a separate paper ) .",
    "we have argued that a model of oscillating magnetic traps is adequate to describe the hxr observations . during the compression of a trap particles",
    "are accelerated , but during its expansion plasma coming from chromospheric evaporation , fills the trap .",
    "this feedback between the particle acceleration and filling of the traps explains high number of electrons which are accelerated in strong flares .",
    "this model is clearly supported by finding weak hxr oscillations a few minutes before the impulsive phase ( see sect.[sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we have compared the properties of the hxr oscillations with available models of flare magnetic structure and particle acceleration and indicated the most adequate scenario ( see sections [ obs ] and [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "hxr light curves can be divided into two components ( see , ): a smooth component ( a smooth line connecting valleys ) and impulsive one ( increases above the smooth line ) . the smooth component is the result of continuous acceleration in many traps whose oscillations are shifted in phase ( this is due to continuous reconnection at the top of cusp structure ) .",
    "the increase of the smooth component during the impulsive phase ( like in fig.[lc ] ) is parallel to increase of the sxr loop - top emission which confirms that the increase of the smooth hxr component is also due to the increase of the density within the cusp - like volume .",
    "if there is a pronounced maximum in the time - profile of the reconnection rate at the top of cusp , then a dominant ( large ) trap will be generated within the cusp - like volume and its oscillations will be seen as quasi - periodic oscillations in hxrs .",
    "we have pointed out that in most cases the hxr and sxr sources are cospatial or overlap during the impulsive phase which confirms that both emissions come from the common cusp - like plasma volume .",
    "but in seldom cases the hxr and sxr loop - top sources are clearly separated ( like in `` masuda flare '' ) .",
    "we explain such cases of hxr sources as being due to magnetic traps , for which the ratio @xmath36 remains high during the compression , so that accelerated electrons remain there for a longer time and therefore generate enhanced hxr emission .",
    "this explanation is also important for the flares having weak hxr footpoint emission ( like in the case of ) .    in our paper of 1998",
    "@xcite we have found that ( a ) loop - top flare kernels are multithermal , ( b ) significant random motions occur in the kernels . on this basis we have proposed that the kernels are filled with mhd turbulence . in the present paper we have used observations of hxr oscillations to improve the model of loop - top kernels .",
    "we have come to the conclusion that during the impulsive phase the kernels are filled with oscillating magnetic traps .",
    "the oscillations are excited and maintained by violent reconnection flow .",
    "the advantages of this model are the following : ( 1 ) it incorporates a simple model of particle acceleration ( fermi and betatron acceleration ) , ( 2 ) the particles can easily escape after their acceleration .",
    "we will observe this plasma volume as being `` turbulent '' ( random motions due to oscillations shifted in phase ; temperature differences between different traps ) .",
