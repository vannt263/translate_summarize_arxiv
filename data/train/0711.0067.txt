    "high - precision measurement of hyperfine structure in the excited states of alkali atoms provides a stringent testing ground for state - of - the - art atomic calculations based on the best wavefunctions @xcite , because it is sensitive to effects such as core polarization and electron correlation .",
    "the @xmath2 line of alkali atoms is routinely used in laser cooling and bose - einstein condensation experiments .",
    "these ultracold atoms are important in experiments ranging from fundamental physics issues such as high - resolution spectroscopy , measurement of fundamental constants , and the study of cold collisions , to applications in atomic clocks and inertial sensors .",
    "heavy alkali atoms are also important in studies of atomic parity violation and the search for a permanent atomic electric dipole moment . in these experiments ,",
    "accurate calculations are needed to properly interpret the experimental results .",
    "in addition , hyperfine structure provides important information about the structure of the nucleus , i.e.  the multipole moments of its charge and current distribution @xcite .",
    "hyperfine structure has been measured with high accuracy in the ground state of alkali atoms using atomic beam magnetic resonance techniques . thus the hyperfine constants are known with a relative precision of better than @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , this high precision of the measurements has led to the definition of the si unit of time in terms of the ground hyperfine interval in cs . however , measurement of hyperfine structure in the excited state is often limited by the linewidth of the transition , which is about 510 mhz for the @xmath1 lines of alkali atoms .",
    "the advent of narrow linewidth tunable lasers ( ring dye lasers and frequency - stabilized diode lasers ) and high - resolution doppler - free spectroscopy techniques ( such as saturated - absorption spectroscopy ) has allowed individual hyperfine transitions to be resolved .",
    "but there is still an issue of frequency calibration and linearity of the laser scan axis .",
    "we have solved this problem by using an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , driven by a easily - measured radio frequency source , to span the difference between hyperfine transitions .",
    "we are thus able to measure hyperfine intervals in the @xmath1 lines of alkali atoms with a typical precision of 12 parts in 1000 of the linewidth . in earlier work ,",
    "we had reported measurement of hyperfine structure in a few alkali atoms . in the current work ,",
    "we present comprehensive results on all the naturally - occurring alkali atoms .",
    "the results , in most cases , are consistent with previously published values but represent a significant improvement in precision .",
    "let us first consider the definition of the hyperfine constants .",
    "the basis states used for defining hyperfine structure are the @xmath4 states , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the quantum numbers associated with , respectively , the electronic angular momentum @xmath8 , the nuclear spin @xmath9 , and the total angular momentum @xmath10 . in the approximation that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are good quantum numbers , the hyperfine interaction energy @xmath11 is given by , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the magnetic - dipole coupling constant , and @xmath15 is the electric - quadrupole coupling constant .",
    "the first excited @xmath0 state of alkali atoms splits into two states , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , due to spin - orbit interaction ( fine - structure splitting ) . of these , the @xmath16 state ( @xmath18 line ) further splits into two hyperfine levels with energy shifts determined by the magnetic - dipole interaction . the electric - quadrupole interaction is present only for @xmath19 , and hence does not affect this state . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath17 state ( @xmath2 line ) splits into four hyperfine levels with energy shifts determined by both interactions . in the case of @xmath20cs",
    ", we will see later that there is evidence of a small additional contribution from a magnetic - octupole hyperfine interaction .",
    "the experimental schematic to measure hyperfine intervals is shown in fig .  1 , and is essentially the same for all atoms .",
    "the output from a frequency - stabilized tunable laser is split into two parts .",
    "the first part goes into an atomic spectrometer , the signal from which is used to lock the laser to a particular hyperfine transition .",
    "the second part is frequency shifted through an aom and then sent into a second atomic spectrometer .",
    "the frequency of the aom is adjusted so that the shifted beam is on a neighboring hyperfine transition .",
    "the error signal from this peak is fed back to the aom driver to lock its frequency .",
    "thus the aom frequency gives a direct measurement of the hyperfine interval . for intervals that are too small or too large to be measured with a single aom ,",
    "we use an additional aom with a fixed frequency offset .",
    "the @xmath1 lines in sodium are in the visible ( at 589 nm ) , hence the tunable laser is a ring dye laser ( coherent 699 - 21 ) .",
    "the laser is frequency stabilized to a reference cavity that gives it an instantaneous linewidth of 1 mhz .",
    "the @xmath1 lines in all the other atoms are in the near infrared which can be accessed using diode lasers .",
    "the diode laser is frequency stabilized using optical feedback from a piezo - mounted grating so that the resulting linewidth is about 500 khz .",
    "the linewidth is reduced considerably when the laser is locked . for locking ,",
    "the laser is frequency modulated at @xmath21 khz , and the signal from the spectrometers is demodulated at @xmath22 to generate the error signals .",
    "such third - harmonic detection provides narrow dispersive signals that are insensitive to intensity fluctuations , to peak pulling from neighboring transitions , or to any residual doppler profile in the spectrum @xcite .    in the case of li",
    ", the spectroscopy is done using a collimated atomic beam .",
    "the atoms are excited by a perpendicular laser beam , and the resulting doppler - free fluorescence signal is measured with a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) . in all the other atoms , we use absorption spectroscopy of a probe beam through a vapor cell .",
    "the cell is either at room temperature ( rb and cs ) or heated to @xmath23c ( na and k ) , to have an atomic density of about @xmath24 @xmath25 . in order to get doppler - free absorption spectra",
    ", we use one of two techniques .",
    "the first technique is the normal saturated - absorption spectroscopy ( sas ) @xcite , where a strong counter - propagating pump beam decreases the absorption of the weak probe beam on resonance . as is well known , the sas technique produces additional crossover resonances , which occur exactly midway between two hyperfine peaks . for closely - spaced levels ,",
    "the large crossover resonances often swamp the true peaks .",
    "this is a problem especially in the @xmath2 lines of na and k , where the level spacing is of the order of one or two natural linewidths .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have recently developed an alternate technique of high - resolution spectroscopy , which we call coherent - control spectroscopy ( ccs ) @xcite .",
    "this technique uses co - propagating control and probe beams , and does not produce crossover resonances . the probe beam is locked on to a hyperfine transition , while the control beam is scanned across a neighboring transition .",
    "when the control comes into resonance with a transition coupling to the same ground level , it `` coherently '' reduces probe absorption through a process similar to electromagnetically induced transparency .",
    "since the probe is locked on a transition , it addresses only the zero - velocity atoms , and the resultant lineshape remains doppler - free even in hot vapor .",
    "we have also done a density - matrix analysis of the effective three - level atom in the presence of the probe and control beams .",
    "the calculated lineshape , after accounting for thermal averaging in hot vapor , describes the measured spectrum quite well @xcite .",
    "apart from the ability to resolve closely - spaced levels , another important advantage of the ccs technique for measuring hyperfine intervals is that the measured value is completely insensitive to detuning of the probe beam .",
    "any detuning of the probe from resonance would imply that it is resonant with a non - zero velocity group . since the control beam co - propagates with the probe beam ,",
    "the spectrum will show peaks only when the control beam comes into resonance with the same non - zero velocity group , which happens only when the aom shift matches the hyperfine interval .",
    "thus , as the probe beam is detuned from resonance , the manifold of peaks ( corresponding to the different hyperfine levels ) will shift within the doppler profile , but their relative separation will remain the same .",
    "the different sources of error in the measurement have been discussed extensively in our earlier publications , and are reviewed here for completeness .",
    "the primary sources of statistical error are the fluctuations in the lock point of the laser and the aom . to minimize these errors",
    ", we use an integration time of 10 s in the frequency counter during each measurement of the aom frequency .",
    "then we take an average of 3540 measurements for a given transition , and repeat the set several times . the resulting standard deviation ( scatter ) in the data set is about 10 khz , from which we take the statistical error in the mean to be @xmath26 khz .",
    "the timebase in the frequency counter used for measuring the aom frequency has a stability of better than @xmath27 , which translates to a negligible error of @xmath28 khz in the frequency measurement .",
    "systematic errors can occur if there are systematic shifts in the lock points of the laser and the aom .",
    "this can arise due to one of the following reasons",
    "_ radiation - pressure effects .",
    "_ radiation pressure causes velocity redistribution of the atoms in the vapor cell . in the sas technique , the opposite doppler shifts for the counter - propagating beams can result in asymmetry of the observed lineshape @xcite .",
    "we minimize these effects by using beam intensities that are much smaller than the saturation intensity . in the ccs technique ,",
    "radiation pressure effects are less important because the doppler shift will be the same for both beams and will not affect the hyperfine interval , similar to how the interval is insensitive to any detuning of the probe from resonance .",
    "effect of stray magnetic fields .",
    "_ the primary effect of a magnetic field is to split the zeeman sublevels and broaden the line without affecting the line center .",
    "however , line shifts can occur if there is asymmetric optical pumping into zeeman sublevels . for a transition @xmath29 , the systematic shift of the line center is",
    "@xmath30 , where @xmath31 mhz / g is the bohr magneton , @xmath32 s denote the land @xmath32 factors of the two levels , and @xmath15 is the magnetic field .",
    "the selection rule for dipole transitions is @xmath33 , depending on the direction of the magnetic field and the polarization of the light .",
    "thus , if the beams are linearly polarized , there will be no asymmetric driving and the line center will not be shifted .",
    "we therefore minimize this error in two ways .",
    "first , we use polarizing cubes to ensure that the beams have near - perfect linear polarization .",
    "second , we use a special magnetic shield @xcite around the cells to minimize the field . the residual field ( measured with a 3-axis fluxgate magnetometer )",
    "is below 5 mg with one layer of shielding , and further reduces to 1 mg with two layers .",
    "phase shifts in the feedback loop .",
    "_ we check for this error by replacing the aom with two identical aoms , and adjusting them so that they produce opposite frequency offsets .",
    "with the laser locked to a given hyperfine transition , the first aom then produces a fixed frequency offset which is compensated by the second aom . thus the same hyperfine transition is used for locking in both spectrometers . under these conditions",
    ", the second aom should lock to the fixed frequency of the first aom , with any error arising solely due to phase - shift errors .",
    "we find that the second aom tracks the frequency of the first aom to within 1 khz .",
    "4 .   _ shifts due to collisions . _",
    "to first order , collisional shifts are the same for different hyperfine levels , and hence do not affect the interval . small differential shifts of the interval have been studied carefully in the ground state of cs , due to its importance in atomic clocks . however",
    ", the size of the shift is in the mhz range @xcite .",
    "we have also studied shifts in the excited state of cs by repeating the measurements with a heated vapour cell .",
    "an increase from 25@xmath34c to 45@xmath34c increases the cs density by a factor of 5 , and we find that the measured values shift by less than 5 khz .",
    "we therefore estimate that the maximum shift due to collisions is 5 khz .",
    "the sizes of the various sources of error are listed in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the size of the zeeman shift is calculated in each atom by considering all allowed combinations of @xmath35 and @xmath36 and taking the one with the largest shift , assuming atoms get completely optically pumped into these sublevels .    as mentioned in point ( i ) above",
    ", the peak center can be shifted due to radiation - pressure effects .",
    "similarly , from point ( ii ) , the center can be shifted if there is _ asymmetric _ pumping into the zeeman sublevels in the presence of a residual magnetic field .",
    "asymmetric optical pumping can occur if the beam polarizations are not perfectly linear , for example due to imperfections in the cubes or birefringence at the cell windows .",
    "finally , there can be a small ac stark shift of the transition due to nearby hyperfine levels from which the laser is detuned .",
    "from an experimental point of view , all these effects will change with laser power .",
    "therefore , we can check for these errors by repeating the measurements at different values of power , and extrapolate to zero power if necessary .",
    "we now consider the hyperfine measurements in each atom in turn .",
    "we present a detailed description of the measurement in li for several reasons .",
    "first , li is the only atom in which we use an atomic beam for spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , it is slightly different from the vapor - cell technique used in other atoms , which has been described in detail in our earlier publications .",
    "second , we give a complete list of the hyperfine intervals measured at different powers .",
    "as mentioned above , this method is used to check for intensity - dependent errors , and we just present a summary of the results in the other atoms . finally , the small ground hyperfine interval in li offers a unique possibility of checking the reliability of our technique , which is not easy in the other atoms .",
    "lithium has two stable isotopes : @xmath37li with @xmath38 and natural abundance of 7.3% , and @xmath39li with @xmath40 and natural abundance of 92.7% .",
    "li spectroscopy was done using a collimated atomic beam generated by heating a stainless steel oven containing li metal to 300@xmath34c .",
    "the oven was placed inside a vacuum chamber maintained at a pressure below @xmath41 torr with a 20 l / s ion pump .",
    "the atomic beam was excited with a perpendicular laser beam generated from a home - built diode laser system operating at 670 nm .",
    "the laser beam was linearly polarized and the interaction region was shielded with a two - layer magnetic shield .",
    "the resulting doppler - free fluorescence signal was detected by a pmt ( hamamatsu r928 ) .",
    "we obtained spectra from the @xmath1 lines of both isotopes . in the @xmath18 line ,",
    "the individual hyperfine transitions are well resolved and we can lock to each peak separately .",
    "however , in the @xmath2 line , the different transitions are only partially resolved because the level spacing is less than the natural linewidth . in recent work where we measured the absolute frequencies of these transitions",
    "@xcite , we showed that a multipeak fit to the partially - resolved spectrum yields the hyperfine constants in the @xmath42 state with a precision of about 50 khz . this is less than the precision with which they are known from earlier experiments .",
    "therefore , in this work we report hyperfine structure only in the @xmath43 state .",
    "typical spectra for the @xmath18 line in the two isotopes of li are shown in figs .",
    "[ f2a](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the four hyperfine transitions in each isotope are clearly resolved .",
    "close - up scans ( normalized ) of a representative peak in each isotope are shown in figs .",
    "[ f2a](c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the solid lines are lorentzian fits showing the excellent fit with featureless residuals .",
    "the size of the residuals gives an idea of the overall signal to noise ratio .",
    "the fit linewidth is @xmath44 mhz ( compared to the natural linewidth of 5.87 mhz ) , indicating that the atomic beam is well collimated because the spread in transverse velocity increases the total linewidth by only about 50% .",
    "the laser linewidth does not contribute significantly to this broadening .",
    "an important consideration in atomic beam experiments is the systematic doppler shift of line center that can occur if the laser beam is not perfectly orthogonal .",
    "in the recent work on absolute frequency measurements of the @xmath1 lines @xcite , we used the same spectrometer to measure the frequencies with laser beams traversing the atomic beam in opposite directions .",
    "since the doppler shift is opposite for the two cases , their difference gives a measure of the misalignment from perpendicularity .",
    "our measurements show that the doppler shift of the transition frequency is only 150 khz , corresponding to a misalignment angle of 0.1 mrad . for the hyperfine interval , this implies a negligible error of less than 1 hz .    in order to measure the hyperfine intervals , both the unshifted laser beam and the aom - shifted beam",
    "were sent across the atomic beam .",
    "the diode laser and the aom were modulated at different frequencies , and the signal from the pmt was independently demodulated at the two frequencies .",
    "the first error signal was used to lock the laser on a given hyperfine transition , while the second error signal was use to lock the aom to the hyperfine interval .",
    "a stringent check on our error estimate in table [ t1 ] is to use our technique to measure the ground hyperfine interval .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this interval is already known in all alkali atoms with @xmath45 relative precision .",
    "however , our technique requires the interval to be accessible with an aom , and this is possible only in @xmath46li , where the intervals are about 200 mhz and 800 mhz respectively . among the different sources of error in this measurement considered before , the effect of collisions is negligible in an atomic beam .",
    "we can also check for the intensity - dependent errors by varying the laser power .",
    "the results of ground hyperfine measurements at three powers are shown in table [ t2 ] .",
    "the beam size is such that the peak intensity ( at beam center ) for the highest power of 42 @xmath47w is 0.84 mw/@xmath48 , which is still smaller than the saturation intensity of 2.51 mw/@xmath48 .",
    "the important thing to note from the table is that all the measurements lie within a few khz of each other , even when the laser power is increased by a factor of three .",
    "this means that shifts due to radiation - pressure and optical - pumping effects are less than 5 khz , consistent with our earlier estimate .",
    "note that increasing the laser power also increases the height of the peaks in the spectrum , their linewidth , and the overall signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the consistency of the values shows that there are no unknown systematic errors related to these parameters . to see",
    "if there is any intensity - dependent trend in the data , we have plotted the measured values versus power in fig .",
    "the linear fit has a small slope , and the extrapolated values of the intervals are    @xmath37li , @xmath49 : = @xmath50 mhz .",
    "@xmath39li , @xmath49 : = @xmath51 mhz .    the quoted error of 6 khz is the total error obtained by adding in quadrature the different sources of error in table [ t1 ] .",
    "all the values in the table lie within 6 khz of the extrapolated value for @xmath37li , and 10 khz for @xmath39li .",
    "these values can be compared with the accurately known values @xcite : 228.2052611 mhz in @xmath37li and 803.5040866 mhz in @xmath39li .",
    "our values are consistent within @xmath52 , confirming that our error estimate is reasonable .",
    "we now turn to the measurement of hyperfine intervals in the @xmath43 state .",
    "since there are two ground hyperfine levels , the same interval can be measured with transitions starting from either level .",
    "as before , the measurements were done at three laser powers as listed in table [ t2 ] .",
    "the measurements at the different powers again lie within a few khz of each other .",
    "the measurements are plotted against power to yield extrapolated values of the intervals as    @xmath37li , @xmath43 : = @xmath53 = @xmath54 mhz .",
    "@xmath39li , @xmath43 : = @xmath55 = @xmath56 mhz .",
    "the maximum deviation of the values in the table from the extrapolated values is only 8 khz ( @xmath57 ) . to the extent that different transitions are susceptible to different degrees of systematic error",
    ", this again confirms that our error estimate is reasonable .",
    "the value of the magnetic - dipole coupling constant @xmath14 in the two isotopes is compared to previous values in table [ t4 ] .",
    "also listed is the recommended value from the review work of arimondo , inguscio , and violino @xcite .",
    "the result in @xmath37li is completely consistent with previous measurements , as seen from the deviation plot in fig .",
    "[ f2c ] , but the accuracy is improved by a factor of 5 . in @xmath39li ,",
    "our value is slightly non - overlapping with the recommended value .",
    "however , it is consistent with a recent measurement @xcite , which has the same accuracy as the recommended value , and an earlier less precise measurement @xcite .",
    "our accuracy is almost an order of magnitude better .",
    "the last column in the table lists the result of a recent calculation of @xmath14 in @xmath39li @xcite , which agrees with our value at the 1.7% level .",
    "sodium has one stable isotope , @xmath58na , with @xmath40 . both the @xmath1 lines are near 589 nm , and are accessed using a cw ring - dye laser ( coherent 699 - 21 ) operating with rhodamine-6 g dye .",
    "na spectroscopy is done in a 100-mm long vapor cell .",
    "the cell is heated to a temperature of @xmath23c and has a magnetic shield around it .",
    "the hyperfine levels in the @xmath59 state are far apart and the individual transitions in the @xmath18 line are well resolved .",
    "hence we have used the standard sas technique for spectroscopy to lock the laser and the aom . as in the case of li ,",
    "intensity - dependent errors are checked by repeating the measurements at three laser powers .",
    "the average value of the interval is    @xmath58na , @xmath59 : = @xmath55 = @xmath60 mhz .",
    "the value of the hyperfine constant is compared to the recommended value and another published result @xcite in fig .",
    "our value is consistent with these results but the accuracy is improved by a factor of 20 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the hyperfine levels in the @xmath61 state of @xmath58na are too close for the individual transitions in the @xmath2 line to be resolved .",
    "hence we have used the technique of ccs to resolve these transitions .",
    "the results of our measurements have been published previously @xcite .",
    "the average values of the intervals are :    @xmath58na , @xmath61 : = @xmath62 = @xmath63 mhz , + @xmath64 @xmath65 mhz .    in fig .",
    "[ f3b ] , we compare our values of the hyperfine constants to the recommended value and two subsequent measurements , one using time - resolved hyperfine quantum - beat spectroscopy @xcite and the second using polarization quantum - beat spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "our values are consistent with the earlier values but the accuracy is improved by a factor of 5 .",
    "potassium has two stable isotopes : @xmath66k with @xmath40 and natural abundance of 93.3% , and @xmath67k with @xmath40 and natural abundance of 6.7% .",
    "the @xmath18 line is at 770 nm and the @xmath2 line is at 767 nm .",
    "it is difficult to obtain reliable laser diodes at these wavelengths , hence our experiments were done sometimes with a frequency - stabilized diode and sometimes with a ring - cavity ti : sapphire laser ( coherent 899 - 21 ) similar to the ring dye laser used for the sodium experiments .",
    "potassium spectroscopy was done in a 50-mm long vapor cell .",
    "the cell was heated to a temperature of @xmath23c and had a magnetic shield around it . due to the low natural abundance of @xmath67k , it is difficult to get a good absorption signal for this isotope , hence we have measured hyperfine structure only in @xmath66k .",
    "the hyperfine levels in the @xmath68 state are separated by about 58 mhz compared to the natural linewidth of 6 mhz .",
    "thus the individual transitions in the @xmath18 line are fairly well resolved . in a first set of experiments",
    ", we measured the interval using normal sas to lock the laser and the aom .",
    "note that the crossover resonance is only 29 mhz away , which is not very far given that the experimentally obtained linewidth in sas is around 10 mhz .",
    "the result for the interval from these measurements was @xmath69 mhz .",
    "the slightly large error is due to the nearby crossover resonance which causes some peak pulling .    in an earlier measurement from our laboratory @xcite",
    ", we had measured the absolute frequencies of individual transitions in the @xmath18 line and hence determined the hyperfine interval indirectly .",
    "the direct measurement of the interval was consistent with this earlier result .",
    "in addition , it agreed with the recommended value in ref .",
    "@xcite ( from a measurement by buck and rabi @xcite using the atomic beam magnetic resonance technique ) . however , there has since been a report of absolute frequency measurements on the same line using a femtosecond comb @xcite .",
    "the value of the interval disagrees from our value ( by @xmath70 combined ) and the recommended value ( by @xmath71 combined ) , too large to be accounted for by any known sources of error .",
    "we have therefore repeated the measurement of the interval but this time using the ccs technique . as mentioned earlier",
    ", this technique does not produce crossover resonances and the measured interval is insensitive to detuning of the control laser .    in fig .",
    "[ f4a ] , we show a typical probe transmission spectrum in @xmath66k obtained with the probe locked to the @xmath72 transition and the control scanning across the @xmath73 transition",
    ". the scanning is done by varying the frequency of the aom in the path of the control , so that the scan axis is properly calibrated and its linearity is guaranteed by the linearity of the voltage - controlled oscillator ( vco ) driving the aom .",
    "note that direct scanning of the laser using intracavity elements usually results in a nonlinear scan .",
    "the aom is double passed to ensure that the direction of the control beam remains unchanged while the aom is scanned , and the output beam intensity is stabilized by feedback control of the rf power exciting the aom .",
    "the open circles in the figure represent the measured spectrum while the solid curves are fits .",
    "we did two kinds of fitting to the spectrum .",
    "the first fit is to a lorentzian lineshape with the peak center and linewidth as fit parameters .",
    "the second fit is to a density - matrix calculation of the effective three - level system taking into account the thermal velocity distribution in hot vapor , as described in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine interval ( which determines the control detuning at the peak ) and the control rabi frequency are free fit parameters .",
    "the residuals from the two fits are also shown in the figure , with the lorentzian fit yielding slightly smaller residuals . however , the location of the peak center from both fits is the same . after fitting to several independent spectra ( to take care of drifts in the vco driving the aom ) ,",
    "we obtain a value of 57.713(42 ) mhz for the interval , close to our earlier measurement and the one by buck and rabi .",
    "the dashed curve shows what the spectrum would look like if the interval were 55.500 mhz as measured by falke _",
    "et al . _",
    "although the spectrum obtained by scanning the aom yields the interval , the locking technique has higher accuracy because the aom frequency is measured while it is locked , and is not susceptible to drifts of the vco . the new result for the interval by locking the aom is    @xmath66k , @xmath68 : = @xmath55 = @xmath74 mhz ,    which is again consistent with the above measurements and our earlier published value .    in fig",
    ".  [ f4b ] , we compare this value of @xmath14 with other published values . as can be seen",
    ", there are two sets of values that are in complete disagreement with each other .",
    "the recommended value and our two results are clustered on one side , while the recent result of falke _ et al_.  @xcite and two older measurements ( which are both from the same group @xcite ) are clustered together .",
    "the experiment of falke _",
    "et al_.@xcite has also been done with great care and takes into account many potential sources of error , hence their measurement seems to be reliable within the stated accuracy .",
    "we do not have a satisfactory explanation for such a large discrepancy .",
    "as mentioned before , the hyperfine levels in the @xmath75 state of @xmath66k are too close to be resolved completely .",
    "hence we have used our technique of ccs to get a partially - resolved spectrum . however , the peaks are still so close that the lock point will get pulled by the nearby transition . therefore , as described above for the @xmath18 spectrum , we measure the intervals by scanning the aom in the path of the control beam .",
    "the aom is again double - passed and the output beam is intensity stabilized .    a typical probe transmission spectrum of the @xmath2 line with the probe locked on the @xmath76 transition is shown in fig .",
    "we saw above in the case of the @xmath18 line that the lineshape is described quite well by a lorentzian curve , hence we extract the locations of the individual hyperfine transitions by doing a multipeak fit to the spectrum . as seen from the figure ,",
    "the featureless residuals are less than 1% of the peak .",
    "the fit linewidth is 8.4 mhz , or only 45% larger than the natural linewidth of 5.8 mhz . after fitting to 25 spectra",

    ", there has been a report of another high - precision measurement of the interval in this state by gerginov _",

    "the hyperfine levels in the @xmath106 state are far apart and the individual transitions in the @xmath2 line are well resolved .",
    "however , the measurements on the @xmath2 line were done using our technique of ccs and not sas .",
    "the advantages of the ccs technique for hyperfine measurements have been highlighted earlier . in cs , there is an additional advantage because , in normal sas , the hyperfine peaks can get distorted and even change sign due to the effects of optical pumping and radiation pressure @xcite . on the other hand , the lineshape in ccs remains symmetric even at high powers .",
    "the measurements in cs have been published previously @xcite .",
    "the large nuclear spin in @xmath20cs implies that , at sufficiently high precision , the intervals will show the effect of a small magnetic - octupole interaction ( characterized by the hyperfine constant @xmath107 ) .",
    "the average values of the hyperfine intervals in terms of these constants are :    @xmath20cs , @xmath106 : = @xmath108 = @xmath109 mhz , + @xmath110 = @xmath111 mhz , + @xmath112 = @xmath113 mhz .",
    "one of the motivations for our work on the @xmath106 state of cs was that the published values of the hyperfine interval @xmath114 had changed from 251.000(20 ) mhz in the work of tanner and wieman @xcite to 251.092(2 ) mhz in the recent work of gerginov , derevianko , and tanner @xcite , a change of 92 khz ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is seen clearly in the deviation plot of the hyperfine constants in fig .",
    "[ f6ab ] , comparing our values to these previous results .",
    "our results are close to the earlier values @xcite , but disagree with the recent measurement by gerginov _",
    "et al_.  @xcite .",
    "it is also from a measurement by gerginov _",
    "et al_.@xcite that our interval in the @xmath18 line differs by 70 khz .",
    "in conclusion , we have recently developed a technique for measuring hyperfine intervals using an aom whose frequency is directly locked to the frequency difference between two transitions .",
    "we use techniques of high - resolution laser spectroscopy to resolve hyperfine transitions in the @xmath1 lines of all the alkali atoms . in lithium",
    ", we study the fluorescence signal from a collimated atomic beam excited by a laser beam at right angles . in all other atoms ,",
    "we study the absorption of a probe beam through a vapor cell , in the presence of either a counter - propagating pump beam ( saturated - absorption spectroscopy ) or a co - propagating control beam ( coherent - control spectroscopy ) .",
    "we are thus able to measure hyperfine intervals in the first - excited @xmath16 and @xmath17 states of these atoms .",
    "this yields the magnetic - dipole coupling constant @xmath14 and the electric - quadrupole coupling constant @xmath15 in these states . in the @xmath106 state of @xmath20cs",
    ", there is evidence of a small magnetic - octupole coupling constant @xmath107 .",
    "the measured hyperfine constants in the various atoms are summarized in table [ t5 ] . as discussed in earlier sections , in most cases our values",
    "are consistent with other measurements but have considerably improved precision .",
    "improved knowledge of the hyperfine constants should prove useful to both theorists and experimentalists working with alkali atoms .",
    "the only state in which we have not measured hyperfine structure with higher precision is the @xmath42 state of li , where the level spacing is smaller than the natural linewidth .",
    "in addition , we have previously used our rb - stabilized ring - cavity resonator to measure the absolute frequencies of the @xmath1 lines in all atoms except @xmath58na .",
    "the hyperfine intervals determined from the differences in the transition frequencies match the intervals measured with the direct aom technique , though the precision is typically five times less for the absolute - frequency method .",
    "the two techniques are very different in the way the frequencies are determined .",
    "hence the consistency indicates that both techniques are reliable within their error bars .    of the 17 constants listed in the table ,",
    "there are only 2 values that are discrepant from recent measurements , namely in the @xmath16 states of @xmath66k and @xmath20cs . in both cases ,",
    "the recent measurements use the frequency - comb technique to measure the absolute frequencies of the transitions .",
    "however , in both cases there are other independent measurements ( albeit with slightly lower precision ) that agree with our results . in the case of @xmath66k",
    ", there is an earlier atomic beam magnetic resonance measurement by buck and rabi @xcite , and in the case of @xmath20cs , there is a previous measurement by hnsch and coworkers also using the frequency - comb technique @xcite .",
    "another common feature of the two frequency - comb measurements is that they use fluorescence spectroscopy from an atomic beam , while we use absorption spectroscopy in a vapor cell .",
    "cell experiments have two advantages over the use of an atomic beam .    1 .",
    "the line center is completely insensitive to the first - order doppler effect .",
    "even if there were a small misalignment angle between the pump / control and probe beams , this would result in a broadening of the line and not a shift . in a beam experiment ,",
    "any deviation from perpendicularity of the atomic beam from the laser beam would result in a systematic doppler shift .",
    "the cell can be magnetically shielded much better than a beam .",
    "our residual field with the two - layer shield is 1 mg , while the residual field in beam experiments is typically 10 times larger .",
    "this could lead to correspondingly larger zeeman shifts .",
    "this is why we have done all our experiments with vapor cells except in the case of lithium , for which it is difficult to make vapor cells because hot lithium vapor is highly reactive and attacks most glasses .",
    "the frequency - comb technique is known to be highly reliable .",
    "the aom technique is also inherently free of systematic errors at this level of precision since the rf frequency can be measured with @xmath116 khz accuracy .",
    "this suggests that any discrepancy with frequency - comb measurements arises due to errors in the atomic spectrometers used , especially when the precision is being pushed to @xmath117 of the spectral linewidth . in other words , the spectral linewidth and the ability to split",
    "the line are going to limit the precision and not the measurement technique _ per se_. the discrepancy in the interval for the @xmath103 state of @xmath20cs between our work and that of gerginov _",
    "et al_.  @xcite is about 70 khz , or 1% of the linewidth .",
    "it is conceivable that one of the two spectrometers is systematically off by this fraction of the linewidth .",
    "however , the discrepancy in the interval for the @xmath68 state of @xmath66k from the work of falke _",
    "et al_.  @xcite is 2 mhz , or 33% of the linewidth .",
    "this is too large to be accounted for by any known problems with the spectrometer .",
    "we have also done the spectroscopy with both the sas and the ccs techniques , and get consistent results .",
    "further high - precision measurements with alternate techniques might shed light on these two cases .",
    "we thank e.  arimondo for useful discussions related to collisional shifts in hyperfine measurements .",
