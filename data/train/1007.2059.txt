    "one of the central topics in current extra - galactic astronomy is how early - type galaxies form and how their properties change through cosmic times .",
    "this is a particularly difficult task as this class of objects shows a diversity in its properties that goes beyond present - day simulations .",
    "the generally accepted framework is that early - type galaxies form in a hierarchical way through the accretion and merging of smaller systems .",
    "although hierarchical growth in itself is a relatively simple premise , the details of early - type galaxy formation and evolution are very complex and depends on a large number of parameters which is likely the reason for the observed variety of the final galaxies .",
    "one of the main issues is how much gas is involved in the accretion / merging process and to what extent it involves approximately equal - mass systems or the accretion of small companions .",
    "theoretical work has shown that the amount of gas involved in the growth of early - type galaxies can be a major factor , in particular in determining the morphological and dynamical structure of early - type galaxies .",
    "for example , more anisotropic and slowly rotating galaxies would result from predominantly collisionless major mergers , while faster rotating galaxies are produced by more gas - rich mergers and accretions .",
    "the inner structure ( i.e.  cores vs cusps ) is also likely related to the type of merger / accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some arguments suggest that the evolution of early - type galaxies is dry , i.e.  gas does not play an important role .",
    "the basic argument is that the amount of stars in red galaxies has at least doubled since @xmath4 , while the red colours of early - type galaxies indicate that they are dominated by old stars .",
    "this indicates that the growth since @xmath4 is dry , i.e.  it is not accompanied with much star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    while this may suggest that globally the amount of gas involved since @xmath4 is at most modest , several observational studies , touching on several topics , show that gas does play at least some role .",
    "for example , stellar - population studies show that many systems do contain a ( often small ) sub - population of relatively young stars that may have formed from accreted gas ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similarly , early work by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , has shown that direct morphological signs of accretion are observed in a large fraction of early - type galaxies and that such signs correlate with the presence of a young stellar sub - population , indicating the presence of gas in these accretions .",
    "more recent work has shown that this is also the case for samples of early - type galaxies that originally seemed to support the dry - merging hypothesis @xcite .",
    "dynamically distinct stellar and gaseous sub - components are often found in early - type galaxies . in many cases ,",
    "such sub - components are both chemically and kinematically distinct @xcite , strongly suggesting that external gas has entered the system .",
    "the orbital structure of fast - rotating early - type galaxies also seems to indicate that gas was involved in their evolution @xcite .",
    "finally , the tight scaling relations found for early - type galaxies place a rather conservative upper limit on the fraction of stellar mass assembled via dissipationless merging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    recently , also",
    "_ direct evidence _ for the importance of gas has been found .",
    "early - type galaxies in the nearby universe used to be generally perceived to be gas poor .",
    "although indeed they typically have less cold gas than spiral galaxies , it is now becoming clear that cold gas is present perhaps most of them , in particular those in the field .",
    "for example , for a detection limit of a few @xmath5 @xmath1 , molecular gas is detected in at least a quarter of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent work on the neutral hydrogen in early - type galaxies suggests that , in terms of detection limits of a few times @xmath0 @xmath1 , about half the field early - type galaxies are detected @xcite .",
    "the hidatacubes obtained by @xcite also show , in terms of the characteristics of the neutral hydrogen detected , the class of field early - type galaxies appears to be rich and varied , much more so than spirals .",
    "an interesting aspect is that early - type galaxies in clusters appear to have different gas properties from those in the field @xcite .",
    "therefore , if gas plays a role in the evolution of early - type galaxies , this should become visible by comparing properties of cluster early - type galaxies with those of objects in the field .",
    "in this paper we expand on the results obtained in @xcite with particular focus on the effect of environment .",
    "we present deep hi  imaging observations for 22 galaxies selected from the _ sauron _  sample @xcite where we have , in contrast to @xcite , also selected galaxies from the virgo cluster . combining these new data with those of @xcite",
    "resulted in deep hi  data for 33 _ sauron _  galaxies north of declination + 10@xmath6 .",
    "this is the largest and deepest collection of hi  imaging data available for early - type galaxies .",
    "the _ sauron _",
    "sample is well suited for a detailed comparison between field and cluster galaxies : for all _ sauron _  galaxies a wealth of information is available , including 3-d spectroscopy of the stars and of the ionised gas as well as data obtained in many other wavebands .",
    "a potential concern is that in principle the hiproperties were part of the selection of the _ sauron _  sample .",
    "however , in practise this affected the selection of only a few objects of the _ sauron_sample of 48 early - type galaxies .",
    "importantly , the selection was done independent of environment .",
    "therefore , results based on a comparison of the hi  properties of _ sauron _  galaxies in different environments should be robust .",
    "the paper is organised in the following way .",
    "we describe the sample selection and the observations in section[sec : observations ] . in section[sec : results ] we present the results for the new hi  detected galaxies . in section[sec : discussion ] we discuss the observed hiproperties of early - type galaxies in the context of their evolution .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a few more things can be learned from this comparison . in the five galaxies where both hi  and co are detected in the central regions , interferometric co observations @xcite",
    "show that the kinematics and the morphology of both components are clearly connected and the same physical structure is detected .",
    "a very nice example is the inner gas disc of ngc 3032 for which the extent and kinematics as seen in co and in hi  match exactly .",
    "a very interesting aspect is that the combination of the co and hiobservations of ngc 2768 , ngc 3032 , ngc 3489 and ngc 4150 gives clear evidence that these inner gas structures form by the accretion of small - gas - rich objects .",
    "the inner gas discs that are seen in ngc 2768 , ngc 3489 and ngc 4150 connect to large , faint hi  plumes that are seen at larger radii , clearly showing that these gas structures formed from accreted gas .",
    "the fact that the inner gas disc in ngc 3032 is counter - rotating to the stars also shows an external origin .",
    "our results also show that the cold ism of the inner gas discs detected both in hi  and co is mainly in the form of molecular gas , with the molecular gas mass being about 10 times higher than that of the atomic gas .",
    "interestingly , this mass ratio is very similar to that seen in the centres of nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , despite the very different state of the ism in these two types of galaxies .              with the new hi  observations presented in this paper , we further confirm the result of @xcite that galaxies with regular hi  discs tend to have strong , extended emission from ionised gas that has the same kinematics as the hi  while galaxies with unsettled hi  structures have less ionised gas .",
    "for the galaxies for which we present data for the first time , regular discs of ionised gas are detected with _",
    "sauron _  in ngc  3032 , ngc  3489 and ngc  4262 @xcite , exactly the three galaxies in the new observations in which regular hi  discs are found . in the remaining hidetections , where the hi  is found in small clouds offset from the centre ( ngc  524 , ngc  3384 and ngc 3608 ) , only small amounts of ionised gas are detected .",
    "we therefore reiterate that , in early - type galaxies , a regular hidisc always has an ionised counterpart .",
    "several earlier studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have concluded that the relation between hi  content and stellar population for field early - type galaxies is complex .",
    "our data show that , on the scale of the spatial resolution of our data , the column densities of the hi  are below the threshold above which star formation is generally occurring .",
    "however , the highest column densities observed are not very much below this threshold , so given the low spatial resolution of our data , some star formation could occur in smaller regions .",
    "low - level star formation ( typically below levels of 0.1 @xmath1 yr@xmath7 ) is indeed observed in some of the gas - rich _ sauron_galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also below ) .",
    "first we discuss to what extent the hi  properties are connected to the ongoing star formation . as expected , some relation seems to hold .",
    "this is best illustrated by comparing our data with those from @xcite . based on _ spitzer _ data , @xcite , similarly to @xcite ,",
    "observe small amounts of star formation in a subset of the _ sauron _  galaxies .",
    "the star formation they observe only occurs in galaxies characterised by fast rotation .",
    "the morphology of the star forming regions is that of a thin disc or ring .",
    "moreover , they were able to distinguish two modes of star formation .",
    "in one mode , star formation is a diffuse process and corresponds to widespread young stellar populations and high specific molecular gas content .",
    "@xcite associate this star formation with small accretion events . in the second mode , the star formation is occurring more centrally concentrated , while outside the region of star formation only old stellar populations are present .",
    "smaller amounts of molecular gas are connected to these central star formation events .",
    "@xcite speculate that in at least some of these objects , the star are forming from gas resulting from internal mass loss .",
    "it is interesting to see that in 4 of the 5 galaxies classified by @xcite to have widespread star formation and that are observed by us , both co _ and _ hi  is detected in the central regions ( table [ tab : tableco ] ) . in contrast , in none of the galaxies with centrally concentrated star formation hi  is detected in the centre .",
    "this confirms the suggestion by @xcite that widespread star formation in early - type galaxies is connected with higher gas content .",
    "we do note that for some early - type galaxies _ galex _ data show that this relation between gas content and star formation also exists at _ large _ radius .",
    "examples are ngc 404 @xcite , ngc 2974 @xcite and eso 38147 @xcite .",
    "almost all galaxies with widespread star formation and observed by us , have hi  discs ( ngc 2685 , ngc 3032 , ngc 3489 , ngc 4150 ) , quite distinct from galaxies with central star formation ( no detection of ngc 4459 and ngc 4477 , while only a small , offset hi  cloud is detected in ngc 524 ) .",
    "the only exception is ngc 4550 , a galaxy in the virgo cluster with widespread star formation and not detected in hi .",
    "this is a very unusual galaxy with two counter - rotating stellar discs .",
    "we also note that in all four galaxies with widespread star formation and detected by us , the hi  is likely to have been accreted ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : morphhi ] ) .",
    "this confirms the conclusion of @xcite that widespread star formation is associated with accretion .",
    "the above results show that some star formation can occur in the gas reservoirs of early - type galaxies , although not all gas - rich galaxies show star formation .",
    "overall , the connection with the properties of the stellar population is poor .",
    "some galaxies indeed behave according to the expectation that the presence of a relatively large amount of hi  indeed is connected to the properties of the stellar population , but the rule seems to be that for every rule there are exceptions . for example , ngc 1023 , ngc 3414 and ngc",
    "4278 have extensive reservoirs of neutral hydrogen , but do not show any evidence for the presence of a young stellar subpopulation . to characterise the overall stellar populations , we have used the single - population - equivalent stellar ages inside 1 @xmath8 as derived for the _ sauron _  galaxies by @xcite .",
    "one way to investigate the connection between hi  and stellar population is to compare these stellar ages of galaxies with hi  to those of galaxies without central hi . in fig .",
    "[ fig : agecum ] we give the cumulative distributions of this stellar age for galaxies where hiis detected in the central regions and for those with no central hi .",
    "this figure suggests that some difference may exist between the two groups of galaxies , with some gas - rich galaxies having younger stellar ages .",
    "however , the difference between the distributions is mainly caused by only a few gas - rich galaxies that have quite young stellar ages ( i.e.  ngc 3032 , ngc 3489 and ngc 4150 which are known to have ongoing star formation ) .",
    "many galaxies with central hi  have similar stellar populations as gas - free galaxies . some galaxies with fairly young or intermediate ages are in fact gas free ( e.g.ngc 3377 and ngc 7457 ) and some gas - rich galaxies have large stellar ages .",
    "a similar trend is seen when the total hi  content is used instead of the central one .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : agescatter ] where we plot the relative global gas content versus stellar age for the different hi  morphologies .",
    "no clear overall trend is visible in this figure , except ( again ) that the three youngest galaxies all have a central hi  disc that is also detected in co. the at most weak connection between hi  and stellar age is to a large extent similar to that seen for the ionised gas .",
    "@xcite show that those _ sauron _  galaxies with relatively much ionised gas also have young stellar ages , but on the other hand several galaxies with young or intermediate age populations are free of ionised gas .",
    "the results discussed above clearly show that the relation between hi  and stellar populations is complex .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the stellar population is the result of the evolution of a galaxy over its entire life , while the current hi  content only reflects the present state . in sect .",
    "4.2 we showed that some amounts of gas are accreted by field early - type galaxies at irregular intervals .",
    "often the amounts of gas involved are small and , even if entirely converted into stars , will only leave subtle signatures in the stellar population that are not always easy to detect ( see also e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the efficiency with which accreted gas is turned into stars depends on many factors .",
    "for example , accretions characterised by loss of gas angular momentum ( e.g. , retrograde encounters ) result in efficient gas infall that triggers central star formation .",
    "this may be observed as a young population in a relatively gas - rich galaxy , but after a while , the gas reservoir will be exhausted and the remnant is observed as hi - poor and centrally rejuvenated @xcite . on the other hand , interactions in which gas retains its angular momentum ( e.g. , prograde encounters ) result in large hi  tidal tails that can later be re - accreted to form large hi  discs . because of their large extent , the column densities in these discs is low and at most some star formation will occur in localised regions at large radius ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent work also suggest that bulges can have a stabilising effect on discs , preventing star formation , even when significant amounts of gas is present @xcite .",
    "plotted as function of relative hi  content .",
    "the different symbols refer to hi  morphology : filled circles : regular disc / ring ( class d ) ; stars : unsettled hi  structures ( class a ) ; open circles : small or offset hi  clouds ( class c ) ; triangles : upper limits , width=302 ]    it is instructive to consider the effect of the environment .",
    "the results discussed so far show that the relation between _ current _ gas content and stellar population is complex .",
    "however , by comparing the virgo early - type galaxies with those in the field , one may get an idea of the effects of gas accretion over longer periods of time .",
    "our data indicate that for field early - type galaxies , gas accretion does play a significant role in determining the stellar population .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the cumulative distributions of the stellar ages of virgo and field galaxies ( fig.[fig : agecum ] ) .",
    "these distributions show that there is a trend of field early - type galaxies , as a population , having younger stellar ages than virgo early - type galaxies .",
    "this difference likely reflects the different long - term accretion history of the two groups of galaxies .",
    "field early - type galaxies regularly accrete small amounts of gas from their environment and , over time , this leaves an observable signature in the stellar population .",
    "in contrast , galaxies in virgo , being in a gas poor environment , grow much less by accretion of gas - rich companions and even if some gas is accreted , it is removed on a short timescale by the cluster environment .",
    "the stellar population of cluster early - type galaxies is much less rejuvenated during their evolution compared to field early - type galaxies .      as described in sec .  2 ,",
    "our observations have also allowed to extract images of the radio continuum emission .",
    "as detailed below , these images are in many cases much deeper than those available so far .",
    "this resulted in a significant number of new detections of the radio continuum associated with our target galaxies .",
    "we detect radio continuum in 13 of the 20 field galaxies and in 5 of the 13 cluster galaxies . with the exception of a few well - known objects with strong radio continuum ( e.g.  ngc  4278 , ngc  4374/m84 ) ,",
    "the majority of the detected sources have a radio flux of at most a few mjy . in all detected sources ,",
    "the radio continuum comes from the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the interesting result is that there appears to be a trend between detection of radio continuum and detection of hi  in or around the galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : agn ] shows the distribution of radio continuum detections as function of hi  presence and hi  morphology .",
    "the histogram shows that the radio continuum detection rate is higher for objects where also hi  is detected , with a suggestion of an additional trend that galaxies with hi  but not in their central regions are less likely to be detected in radio continuum than galaxies with hi  in the centre , but more likely than galaxies with no hiat all .",
    "this suggests that the cold gas somehow contributes in feeding the processes that produce the radio continuum emission in some galaxies .",
    "it is well known that both star formation and agn activity can contribute to the radio continuum emission from early - type galaxies @xcite . here",
    "we address the question is to what extent the observed trend with hi properties is connected to radio emission from star formation or from radio - loud agn .    to study this question , we estimated the radio continuum flux expected to be observed from the amounts of star formation seen by @xcite and compared these with the observed fluxes .",
    "of the 8 star forming galaxies overlapping between @xcite and us , 7 are detected in radio continuum .",
    "we used the relation given by @xcite to convert star formation rates to radio luminosities . for ngc 2685 ,",
    "ngc 3032 , ngc 3489 , ngc 4150 and ngc 4459 , the observed radio continuum flux matches , within the errors , what is expected from the observed star formation rates and we conclude that the observed radio continuum is associated with the star formation .",
    "ngc 524 is known to have a faint radio agn @xcite , and when correcting the observed radio flux for this agn , also for this galaxy the observed radio continuum matches that what is expected based on the observed star formation rate .",
    "our upper limit to the continuum flux of ngc 4550 is consistent with the observed star formation in this galaxy . because @xcite derive the star formation rates from fir data , the good match between predicted and observed radio continuum in these galaxies implies that they follow the well - known radio - fir correlation . only in one star forming galaxy ( ngc 4477 )",
    "is the observed radio flux much larger than expected ( by about a factor 7 ) , which most likely means that this galaxy harbours a radio loud agn .    in the previous section",
    ", we showed that galaxies with hi  in their central regions are more likely to have star formation , while here we find that in many of these star forming galaxies , the radio continuum detected is due to this star formation .",
    "for about half the galaxies represented in the first bin of fig .",
    "[ fig : agn ] this is the case . on the other hand , for both other hi  classes shown in this figure",
    ", only one of the objects is forming stars .",
    "these results show that the trend seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : agn ] is at least partly due to enhanced star formation in galaxies with central hi .",
    "the spatial resolution of our observations is relatively low ( corresponding to a linear scale of the order of a kpc for the most distant galaxies ) .",
    "this makes it difficult to decide , based on the radio data alone , whether the observed radio continuum is due to a radio - loud agn .",
    "we therefore have searched the literature for higher resolution radio continuum data .",
    "one possibility is to look into the first survey ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters * ? ? ?",
    "first data have better spatial resolution ( @xmath9 ) , but higher noise level ( about 1 mjy beam@xmath7 ) compared to our wsrt observations .",
    "a search for detections in this survey has been also done by @xcite . of the 9 field galaxies detected by us at the level of a few mjy ( i.e.  such that the sensitivity of first would allow to detect these sources ) 7",
    "are detected by first . in only one of these detections - ngc  3032 -",
    "the radio emission is resolved by first , suggesting the presence of star formation , consistent the results presented here on this galaxy .",
    "more instructive is , however , to consider the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "their work focuses on detecting radio nuclei with high brightness temperature ( @xmath10 k ) and/or jet - like structures as unambiguous indications for the presence of an agn .",
    "they concentrated on low - luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) and agn selected from the palomar spectroscopic sample of northern galaxies that they have studied at high frequency ( 15 g  hz ) with the vla ( 0.15@xmath11 resolution ) and with vlbi at intermediate and high radio frequencies . at these high resolutions ( corresponding to a linear size of a few tens of pc ) , they detect radio emission in almost 50 % of the sources , suggesting a high incidence of radio cores .",
    "interestingly , their sample includes a fair number of our objects , although , unfortunately , the sensitivity of their observations is not as good as of our wsrt observations ( flux limit of 1 - 1.5 mjy for the vla observations and 2.7 mjy for the vlbi observations ) . of the galaxies that are in common , for 11",
    "is our wsrt flux above their detection limit and _ all _ are detected in the high - resolution observations of nagar et al .",

    "list but is classified as agn by @xcite and also this object is detected in radio ( both by wsrt and by first ) .",
    "almost all these objects are observed not to have star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that many of our early - type galaxies harbour a radio - load agn .",
    "interestingly , these agn are evenly distributed over the three hi  classes used in fig .",
    "[ fig : agn ] suggesting that agn activity is not connected to whether there is cold gas in the central region of an early - type galaxy or not .",
    "the observed relation between central gas content and radio continuum seems therefore to be due to a higher probability for radio emission from star formation if a galaxy has a relatively large amount of gas in the central regions .",
    "we have presented new , deep westerbork synthesis radio telescope observations of the neutral hydrogen in 22 nearby early - type galaxies selected from a representative sample of early - type galaxies studied earlier at optical wavelengths with the _ sauron _  integral - field spectrograph .",
    "combined with our earlier observations , this resulted in deep hi  data on 33 nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "this is the largest homogeneous dataset of hi  imaging data available for this class of objects .",
    "in contrast to our earlier study @xcite , this sample both covers field environments and the virgo cluster . we find that the hi  properties strongly depend on environment . for detection limits of a few times @xmath0 @xmath1",
    ", we detect hi  in about 2/3 of the field galaxies , while for virgo galaxies the detection rate is @xmath210% .",
    "this is consistent with earlier work @xcite .",
    "we confirm earlier results @xcite that in about half the early - type galaxies with hi , this atomic gas is in a regularly rotating hi  disc or ring . in many objects ,",
    "unsettled hi  structures are detected , such as tails and clouds , sometimes connecting to a regular hi  disc .",
    "this suggests that the gas discs form through accretion .",
    "we conclude that accretion of hi  commonly occurs in field early - type galaxies , but typically with very modest accretion rates .",
    "in contrast , cluster galaxies do not accrete cold gas .",
    "all the hi  discs that we observed have counterparts of ionised gas .",
    "moreover , galaxies with an inner hi  disc also have an inner molecular gas disc .",
    "the strikingly similar kinematics of these different tracers shows that they are all part of the same structure . the combination of hi  and co imaging clearly shows , through the detection of gas tails , that the inner discs are the result of accretion events .",
    "the cold ism in the central regions is dominated by molecular gas ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "there is no obvious overall relation between current gas content and internal dynamics .",
    "this is not very surprising given that in most galaxies with hi  it is due to the recent accretion of small amounts of gas while the dynamical characteristics are set over much longer timescales .",
    "within our limited number statistics , the fastest rotating galaxies all posses hi  disks .",
    "this would suggest that an accretion / merger involving a large amount of gas is required to produce the galaxies most dominated by rotation .",
    "however , the reverse is not true as hi  disks can be present also at intermediate @xmath12 .",
    "the similarity between the kinematics of the hi  and that of the stars seen in some of the galaxies with large , regular hi  disks , suggests that an accretion / merger involving a large amount of gas was part of the evolution of those systems .",
    "we observe a close relationship between gas content and the small amounts of star formation which occurs in some of the _ sauron _  galaxies .",
    "galaxies with widespread star formation are gas rich and are galaxies that have experienced a recent accretion event .",
    "the radio continuum emission detected in these galaxies is consistent with the star formation observed .",
    "however , as already noticed by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xcite , the relation between hi  and the overall properties of the stellar population is very complex .",
    "the few galaxies with a significant young sub - population and/or star formation , have inner gas discs . for the remaining galaxies",
    "there is no trend between stellar population and hi  properties . very interestingly",
    ", we find a number early - type galaxies that are very gas rich but are not forming stars and have not done so for a while as they only have an old stellar population .",
    "one example of such a galaxy is ngc 4278 where the fact that the large hidisc shows very regular kinematics implies that this galaxy has been gas rich for at least a few gyr . despite this , there is no evidence for a young stellar population in this galaxy .",
    "in addition , we find that the stellar populations of our field galaxies are typically younger than those in virgo .",
    "this is expected because field galaxies are likely to have accreted some gas in the last few gyr , while in the virgo cluster this is not the case .",
    "the difference in stellar population is reflecting of the differences in accretion history of cold gas between the two groups of galaxies .    in about 50% of our sample",
    ", we detect a central radio continuum source . in many galaxies ,",
    "the continuum emission is due to a radio - loud agn , but continuum emission from star formation is also detected in some galaxies .",
    "galaxies with star formation follow the radio - fir correlation .",
    "the presence of radio continuum emission correlates with the hi  properties , in the sense that galaxies with hi  in the central region are more likely to be detected in continuum compared to galaxies without hi .",
    "galaxies with hi  but in off - centre structures behave in between .",
    "this trend is mainly due to the star formation observed in galaxies with central gas reservoirs , and is not related to agn fuelling .    in this paper , we have presented a number of interesting trends that suggest that gas and gas accretion plays a role in the evolution of early - type galaxies , in particular those found in the field .",
    "although our collection of hi  images is the largest and deepest available for early - type galaxies , the number is still fairly small and the statistical basis for most of the trends we find is not strong .",
    "similar data on larger samples will be needed to put the results presented here on a more solid basis .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of deep westerbork synthesis radio telescope observations of the neutral hydrogen in 33 nearby early - type galaxies selected from a representative sample studied earlier at optical wavelengths with the _ sauron _  integral - field spectrograph . </S>",
    "<S> this is the deepest homogeneous set of hi  imaging data available for this class of objects . </S>",
    "<S> the sample covers both field environments and the virgo cluster . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that gas accretion plays a role in the evolution of field early - type galaxies , but less so for those in clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> the hi  properties of _ sauron _  early - type galaxies strongly depend on environment . for detection limits of a few times @xmath0 @xmath1 , hi  </S>",
    "<S> is detected in about 2/3 of the field galaxies , while @xmath210% of the virgo objects are detected . in about half of the detections , the hi  forms a regularly rotating disc or ring . in many galaxies </S>",
    "<S> unsettled tails and clouds are seen . </S>",
    "<S> all hi  discs have counterparts of ionised gas and inner hi  discs are also detected in molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> the cold ism in the central regions is dominated by molecular gas ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> assuming our sample is representative , we conclude that accretion of hi  is very common for field early - type galaxies , but the amount of material involved is usually small and the effects on the host galaxy are , at most , subtle . </S>",
    "<S> cluster galaxies appear not to accrete hi , or the accreted material gets removed quickly by environmental effects . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between hi and stellar population is complex . </S>",
    "<S> the few galaxies with a significant young sub - population all have inner gas discs , but for the remaining galaxies there is no trend between stellar population and hi  properties . a number of early - type galaxies are very gas rich , but only have an old population . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar populations of field galaxies are typically younger than those in virgo . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely related to differences in accretion history . </S>",
    "<S> there is no obvious overall relation between gas hi  content and global dynamical characteristics except that the fastest rotators all have an hi disk . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that if fast and slow rotators are the result of different evolution paths , this is not strongly reflected in the _ current _ hi  content . in about 50% of the galaxies we detect a central radio continuum source . in many objects </S>",
    "<S> this emission is from a low - luminosity agn , in some it is consistent with the observed star formation . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies with hi  in the central regions are more likely detected in continuum . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to a higher probability for star formation to occur in such galaxies and not to hi - related agn fuelling .    </S>",
    "<S> [ firstpage ]    galaxies : elliptical and lenticular , cd  galaxies : evolution </S>"
