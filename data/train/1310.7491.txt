    "metal plasmonics has been investigated very intensively in the last decades .",
    "it is nowadays well known that in the visible metal structures like metal films or nanoparticles , for instance , are the plasmonic structures of choice exhibiting strong field confinement and large field enhancement close to the metallic structure . in contrast , research on graphene plasmonics which is in some sense complementary to metal plasmonics  @xcite has just begun .",
    "the plasmons in graphene show strong field confinement in the infrared , whereas in the visible graphene plasmonics is challenging  @xcite .",
    "one of the main advantages of using graphene in plasmonics or graphene - based hybrid - plasmonic devices is its tunability by doping or gating  @xcite . especially for applications of the frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) such as _ in vivo _ infrared flourescence imaging applications as for example",
    "lymph - node mapping and cancer imaging  @xcite graphene plasmonics is highly suitable and can unfold its full strength .",
    "the frster resonant - energy transfer ( fret ) itself is widely used in biochemistry to study protein and rna folding  @xcite , dna nanomechanical devices  @xcite and even to transport energy along a dna backbone  @xcite to mention a few applications .",
    "theoretically it was already shown in the 80 s that in the vicinity of nanoparticles fret between a donor and an acceptor molecule can be enhanced by two to five orders of magnitude in the idealized case when both the donor and acceptor are in resonance with the localized plasmon resonance  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical works have also studied the impact of nonlocal effects and the possibility of magneto - optical control of fret close to metallic nanoparticles  @xcite . although the plasmonic enhancement ( pe ) effect using nanoparticles could be measured lately  @xcite , only moderate enhancement factors of 3.5 and 8.6 were found  @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments report fret enhancements by a factor of 173  @xcite .",
    "the pe could also be demonstrated experimentally for fret between a donor and acceptor separated by a metal film  @xcite .    in this letter , we demonstrate how graphene plasmonics can enhance fret in the infrared .",
    "we want to emphasize that most recent studies are considering spontaneous emission close to graphene  @xcite which is a _ first - order _ process , whereas fret is a _ second - order _",
    "process  @xcite .",
    "we study in detail the fret between a donor - acceptor pair in close vicinity to a graphene sheet as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "we show that fret mediated by the plasmons in the graphene sheet is broadband and can be enhanced by _",
    "six _ orders of magnitude .",
    "the broadband property of the pe is very advantageous since one can expect large pe also in cases where the emission and absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor do not fully overlap .",
    "further we show that the presence of graphene allows for energy transfer between perpendicularly oriented dipole moments which do not couple in free space .",
    "finally , we discuss how the interaction of the graphene plasmons with the surface phonon polaritons of a sic substrate affects the energy transfer .",
    "since graphene is highly tunable this pe effect can be easily controlled even dynamically .",
    "using second - order perturbation theory the energy transfer rate for dipole - dipole interaction between a donor and an acceptor in the presence of arbitrarily shaped , dispersing and absorbing bodies can be written as  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the _ free space _ absorption and emission spectra of the acceptor and the donor .",
    "the energy transfer function @xmath3 between the donor and acceptor is  @xcite @xmath4 introducing the dipole - transition matrix elements @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the donor and acceptor .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 determine the orientation of the dipole moments .",
    "@xmath9 is the permittivity of vacuum . through the green s function @xmath10 the environment of the donor at @xmath11 and the acceptor at @xmath12",
    "is fully taken into account .",
    "the energy transfer function @xmath3 can also be expressed in terms of the free space spontaneaous emission rates  @xcite @xmath13 we obtain @xmath14 by normalizing the emission and absorption spectra by the free space emission rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 we can rewrite the expression for the energy transfer as @xmath17 introducing the dimensionless energy transfer function @xmath18    the enhancement factor for the energy transfer close to a plasmonic structure like graphene in comparison to vacuum is defined as @xmath19 where the green s function @xmath20 is a sum of the vacuum green s function @xmath21 and the scattered green s function @xmath22 .",
    "the explicit expressions of the green s functions for free space and planar structures can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also supporting information ) .",
    "before we can determine the energy transfer rate between the donor and acceptor close to a sheet of graphene it is necessary to determine its optical properties which enter in the scattered green s function .",
    "the optical properties of graphene are fully described by its in - plane conductivity @xmath23 consisting of the drude - like intraband contribution @xmath24 and the interband contribution @xmath25 which are given by  @xcite @xmath26 , \\\\",
    "\\sigma_i & = \\frac{e^2}{4 \\hbar } \\biggl [ g\\biggl ( \\frac{\\hbar \\omega}{2 } + { { \\rm i}}\\frac{4 \\hbar \\omega}{\\pi } \\int_0^\\infty { { \\rm d}}\\xi \\ , \\frac{g(\\xi ) - g(\\hbar\\omega/2)}{(\\hbar \\omega)^2 - 4 \\xi^2 } \\biggr ) \\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the temperature of the graphene sheet , @xmath29 is its fermi - level which can be tuned by gating and doping for instance .",
    "@xmath30 is a phenomenological damping constant , @xmath31 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath32 is planck s constant and @xmath33 is the electron charge .",
    "the in - plane conductivity enters in the fresnel reflection coefficients . for a graphene sheet on a dielectric substrate with permittivity @xmath34 the reflection coefficients for s- and p - polarized light",
    "are given by  @xcite ( see also supporting information ) @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the in - plane wave vector and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the out - of - plane wave vectors inside the substrate and in vacuum .",
    "the substrate can have quite a large impact on the properties of the plasmons in graphene , in particular , when it supports surface phonon polaritons like sio@xmath39 and sic  @xcite . for convenience we will neglect the influence of the substrate in the following and focus mainly on suspended graphene .",
    "the plasmons in graphene propagating along the sheet are determined by the poles of the reflection coefficient for p polarization .",
    "when assuming that we have suspended graphene ( @xmath40 ) then the dispersion relation of the plasmon simply reads @xmath41 from this dispersion relation one can easily determine the wavelength @xmath42 and the propagation length @xmath43 of the plasmon .",
    "for a relatively high fermi level @xmath44 which can be realized nowadays  @xcite table  [ table1 ] summarizes some of the plasmon properties as the in - plane confinement and the propagation length for frequencies ranging from @xmath45 .",
    "the in - plane confinement @xmath46 is in this case strong and can attain values of @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the out - of - plane confinement is even stronger : since the out - of - plane wave vector is approximately @xmath49 the out - of - plane confinement is given by @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the out - of - plane confinement is between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the propagation length @xmath53 of the plasmons in graphene is found to be between @xmath54 and @xmath55 depending on the frequency so that @xmath56 is between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that the propagation length approximately scales linearly with the relaxation time @xmath30 so that @xmath56 can even reach values on the order of 100 for @xmath59 as shown in ref .",
    "further note that the plasmon properties can be easily tuned by changing the fermi level by gating or tuning .",
    ".the in - plane confinement @xmath46 , the propagation length @xmath53 , and @xmath60 of the surface plasmons in graphene using @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63.[table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to demonstrate the pe we consider a donor and an acceptor on a plane parallel to the graphene sheet . the distance of this plane to the sheet of graphene which is assumed to be in the x - y plane is choosen to be @xmath64 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : distancedependence](a)-(c ) the enhancement factor @xmath65 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : enhancementfactor ] is plotted as a function of distance @xmath66 between the donor and the acceptor for parallely aligned dipole moments along the @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 axis .",
    "it can be seen that fret mediated by the plasmons in graphene can be _ six _ orders of magnitude larger than in free space .",
    "that means that also the recently studied nonparaxial spin - hall effect of light  @xcite will be extraordinary large in the vicinity of graphene .",
    "further the maximum enhancement is obtained for distances on the order of the propagation length of the graphene plasmons . in fig .",
    "[ fig : distancedependence](d ) we show a plot of the enhancement factor @xmath65 as a function of distance @xmath66 and frequency @xmath70 for the case where the dipole moments of the donor and acceptor are oriented along the z axis .",
    "it becomes apparent that the pe is broadband in frequency for distances @xmath66 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "hence , one can expect that the predicted large enhancement of fret can be achieved in the realistic case where the emission and absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor are nonresonant in contrast to the case of metallic nanoparticles where the resonance of the localized plasmon is narrow band .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyplots](a),(d),(g),(j ) we show plots of @xmath65 where the acceptor is placed at @xmath73 and the x - y position of the donor position @xmath74 is varied .",
    "once more it becomes obvious that the largest enhancement factors can be obtained for distances around the propagation length of the graphene plasmons @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , we have plotted the energy transfer function above graphene @xmath75 and in free space @xmath76 .",
    "note that the enhancement factor @xmath65 is invariant under rotation around the @xmath69 axis for @xmath77 and @xmath78 although @xmath75 and @xmath76 are not .",
    "it is interesting to note that due to the presence of the graphene sheet there is also fret between the donor and acceptor for ( @xmath77 , @xmath79 ) and ( @xmath80,@xmath79 ) .",
    "the free space fret vanishes in this case so that @xmath65 is not a well defined quantity for such orientations of dipole moments .",
    "but the energy transfer function @xmath81 shown in fig .  [ fig : crosscoupling ] indicate that the pe of fret is in the same order of magnitude as for the cases considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyplots ] .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the impact of the substrate . in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) we show a plot of the enhancement factor @xmath65 of fret above a graphene sheet deposited on sic as a function of frequency and distance .",
    "we choose @xmath64 and @xmath82 . for comparison we also plot the enhancement factor for suspended graphene in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) using the same parameters ( for similar plots using @xmath62 see supporting information ) .",
    "in contrast to the results found in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) we can see a gap of negligible small fret in the _ reststrahlen _ region of sic ( i.e.  frequencies between the transversal and longitudinal phonon frequencies @xmath83 and @xmath84 )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , due to the interaction of the graphene plasmon with the surface - phonon polaritons in sic the pe is redshifted and concentrated at frequencies slighty larger than @xmath85 .",
    "it can also be seen that the enhancement factor on graphene / sic is slightly smaller and the effect is more narrowband compared to the case of suspended graphene .",
    "hence , by choosing an active or inactive substrate the observed fret enhancement can be further controlled .",
    "in summary we have shown that in close vicinity to a sheet of graphene fret can be enhanced by six orders of magnitude .",
    "the maximum enhancement is obtained for donor - acceptor distances on the order of the propagation length of the plasmons in graphene .",
    "further , we have shown that the enhancement effect is broadband and depends not only on the relative position of the donor and acceptor but also on the orientation of their dipole moments .",
    "in particular , the presence of graphene allows for coupling of perpendicularly oriented dipole moments which do not couple in free space .",
    "the role of the substrate is briefly discussed using sic .",
    "hence , the observed plasmonic enhancement can be tuned by doping or gating of graphene and by choosing an appropriate substrate .",
