    "rotation curve is the major tool to study the dynamics and structure of the galaxy ( binney and merrifield 1998 ; sofue and rubin 2001 ; sofue et al .",
    "once it is determined , the rotation curve is used to obtain the distribution of mass in the galaxy , and map the interstellar matter from kinematical observables .",
    "accuracy of the obtained results depends not only on the observational accuracy , but also on the methods as well as on the location of observed objects in the galactic disk .",
    "however , accuracy analyses have been not systematically obtained in the current studies of galactic kinematics .",
    "vlbi measurements of parallaxes and proper motions of galactic maser sources have opened a new era in the study of galactic kinematics , particularly in determining the rotation curve and distances of objects ( e.g. honma et al .",
    "2007 ; reid et al . 2009 ) .",
    "vera has played the essential role , and high accuracy determination of the rotation velocity is now available using trigonometric distance measurements combining with proper - motion ( honma et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "a more general method to measure the distance , radial velocity , and proper motion at the same time has been applied for determining three - dimensional velocity vectors of maser sources ( oh et al .",
    "these measurements are expected to provide us with a global rotation curve constructed from objects distributed over the galactic disk .",
    "this will improve the accuracy not only of the outer rotation curve , but also of the inner rotation curve , where the current observations have been obtained mostly from the tangent point data .",
    "accordingly , observations of a larger number of objects distributed in the galactic disk have become possible for deriving the rotation curve .",
    "we remember that the accuracy of derived rotation velocity depends not only on the intrinsic observing errors , but also on the location of measured objects .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the behaviors of observable kinematical quantities such as the radial velocity and proper motions in the galactic disk .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the accuracy of derived rotation velocities on the galactic positions of the observed sources .",
    "the results would be useful as a guide for optimizing the selection of objects for determination of the galactic rotation curve .",
    "the present analyses will be given on the assumption of circular rotation of the galactic objects .",
    "we present the result only for a fixed set of the galactic constants , @xmath0 kpc and @xmath1",
    ". however , the analysis does not include systematic errors arising from the uncertainties of these quantities .",
    "hence , this paper should be taken as a methodological guide , and a more practical use may be recalculated for such constants in individual cases and data sets .",
    "the tangent - point method , or the terminal velocity method , has been most often applied to determine the inner rotation curve ( clemens 1985 ) .",
    "the outer rotation curve has been determined using spectro - photometric distances combined with radial velocities of interstellar lines ( fich et al .",
    "1989 ) , or by the hi disk thickness method ( merrifield 1991 ; honma and sofue 1997 ) . however , the outer rotation curve is still crude mainly because of the distance uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig - rc ] shows a rotation curve of the galaxy obtained by compiling measured rotation velocities from the literature in the decades ( sofue et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the galactic constants are taken to be @xmath2 kpc and @xmath1 in this paper .",
    "recent values from vera observations are also included ( see table [ tab - veravrot ] ) .",
    "rotation velocities within the solar circle are accurately determined using the tangent point method , which uses the terminal velocities in the spectral lines of interstellar gases ( clemens 1985 ) . since",
    "this method does not require distances of the emission regions , it gives relatively high accuracy of rotation velocity . on the other hand , the outer rotation curve is crude , because the distance measurements of objects , which usually contain large errors , are inevitable ( blitz 1979 ; fich et al .",
    "1989 ; merrifield 1992 ; honma and sofue 1997 ; binney and dehnen 1997 ) .    in order to discuss the accuracy of derived rotation velocities in the following sections , we need to use an approximate rotation curve to represent the observations .",
    "since the present study treats the kinematics only in the galactic plane , we here adopt a simple model of three - component plummer potential .",
    "v(r)= , [ eq - vrot ] and = , [ eq - phi ] where @xmath3 is the gravitational constant , @xmath4 are the scale radii of the individual mass components , and @xmath5 are the masses .",
    "table [ tab - plummer ] lists the values of the parameters , and figure [ fig - rcmodel ] shows the model rotation curve , which approximately represents the observations in figure [ fig - rc ] with @xmath0 kpc and @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the calculated results in the next sections are not strongly dependent on the shape of rotation curve .",
    ".plummer potential parameters for a model galactic rotation curve , mimicking the observed rotation curve in figure [ fig - rc ] . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - mudistance ]      the error propagation is estimated from equation ( [ eq - mu ] ) by giving small perturbations to @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we again neglect the term including @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath10 , or the error in @xmath11 , may be expressed in terms of @xmath12 as r_= r^2 v(r ) -v_0 .",
    "[ eq - drmu ]    figure [ fig - admufi ] shows the accuracy diagram for kinematical @xmath8 distance @xmath11 , or the distribution of @xmath10 on the galactic plane , calculated for @xmath13 .",
    "the figure indicates that the distance ambiguity is largest along the sun - gc line in the near side of the galactic center , where the objects have proper motions @xmath14/r$ ] , which is usually small because of the flat rotation curve .    on the other hand ,",
    "the ambiguity is drastically reduced in the region beyond the galactic center , where the object moves in the opposite direction to the solar motion , perpendicularly to the line of sight at about twice the rotation velocity , yielding large proper motion ~-v(r)+v_0 r , yielding @xmath15 for a solar circle object beyond the galactic center .",
    "hence , the distances of sun - gc line objects beyond gc may be determined with relatively good accuracy from the proper motion method .",
    "this is particularly important , because distances can not be measured by radial - velocities .",
    "also , the trigonometric ( parallax ) measurements would be still difficult for such distant objects beyond gc , whereas the proper motion is sufficiently large .",
    "we here try to apply the proper - motion method for kinematical distance @xmath11 to the observed @xmath8 values given in table [ tab - veradata ] .",
    "table [ tab - mudistance ] lists the thus derived distances .",
    "we obtained converged solutions for the two sources , fgl2789 and g48.61 + 0.02 .",
    "the iteration diverged for the other sources , whose proper motions exceed the expected values from the model rotation curve .",
    "this may arise either due to intrinsically non - circular motions of the sources ( e.g. oh et al .",
    "2009 ) , or by the adopted rotation curve which might not well represent the true galactic rotation .    , for @xmath16 .",

    "we have analyzed the expected errors in rotation curve determinations arising from observational errors of distance , radial velocity and proper motion for individual objects depending on their galactic positions .",
    "we displayed the error distributions for derived rotation velocities from the various methods as accuracy diagrams .",
    "we presented the accuracy diagrams for some combinations of assumed errors in @xmath7 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while they represent the general properties of the error distributions .",
    "if we adopt different combinations of intrinsic observation errors , the diagrams will change quantitatively , but their general characteristics are similar to those presented here .    the radial velocity method assuming circular motion has been most often used in the decades .",
    "the tangent point method for the inner rotation curve using the hi and co line emissions is an extreme case choosing objects on the loci of the minimum errors in figure [ fig - vrad ] .",
    "the accuracy diagram , @xmath21 , well explains the reason why the observed rotation curve in figure [ fig - rc ] is nicely determined at @xmath22 kpc by the tangent - point method compared to the outer rotation curve .",
    "the tangent - point circle is a special region where the radial velocity method can give the highest accuracy rotation curve .",
    "furthermore , this diagram suggests that the butterfly areas at @xmath23 and @xmath24 are suitable regions for selecting the sources for determination of outer rotation curve in this method .",
    "it should be mentioned that similar accuracy is expected for sources within the tangent - point circle in order to determine the inner rotation curve .",
    "sources near the sun - gc line are , of course , not appropriate for this method , as the accuracy diagram shows singularity .    in the proper motion method assuming circular motion ,",
    "the most accurate measurement of rotation velocity is obtained for objects near the sun - gc line as shown by the accuracy diagram , @xmath25 , in figure [ fig - vprop ] , as indeed realized by honma et al .",
    "it must be also emphasized that the minimum error area is widely spread over @xmath26 in the anti - center region , as well as in the central region inside the tangent - point circle .",
    "the largest error occurs for objects lying near the tangent - point circle .",
    "thus , the tangent - point circle is singularity circle in this method .    in the 3-d velocity vector measurement , where no assumption of circular motion is made , the three independent values of the radial velocity ,",
    "proper motion and distance are required at the same time .",
    "the accuracy diagram , @xmath27 , in figures [ fig - vvec ] indicates milder dependence of the accuracy on the location of the sources compared to those in the previous two methods .",
    "optimization of source selection is , therefore , easier in the 3-d method .",
    "analyses of the accuracy diagrams presented in this paper may summarize the behaviors observed in the galactic rotation curves obtained in the decades . in the current observations",
    ", source selection has been optimized by the authors a priori , while it was not necessarily in a systematic way .",
    "the present analysis may be helpful for further source selections in the future in order to optimize the observations for higher accuracy rotation curves from limited resources of observing time and facilities .",
    "once a rotation curve is obtained , it may be in turn used to map the ism and stellar objects in the galactic plane from their radial velocities and proper motions .",
    "the former method has been often applied to map the galaxy .",
    "the latter method , however , is not used often because of the lack of proper motion measurements .",
    "the recent vlbi trigonometric measurements of proper motions would be challenging in mapping the galaxy .",
    "we have presented the radial velocity field , @xmath28 , and proper motion field , @xmath29 , for an assumed circular rotation curve as in figure [ fig - rcmodel ] .",
    "we constructed accuracy diagrams , @xmath30 and @xmath6 , for distance measurements using the velocity and proper motion fields .",
    "the @xmath30 field confirms the current behaviors seen in the galactic maps so far published in the decades .",
    "the @xmath6 also confirms that the proper motion measurements are powerful tool to solve the distance ambiguity in the galaxy along the sun - gc line , particular for sources beyond the galactic center .",
    "finally , we comment on possible systematic errors .",
    "non - circular motions by the bar , spiral arms , random motions , tidal effects by the companion galaxies , etc .. , would be superposed on the rotation curve .",
    "such effects will cause systematic errors in the determined quantities , and affect the error analyses .",
    "the uncertainties in the adopted galactic constants like @xmath31 and @xmath32 affect the results , which , moreover , affect the adopted rotation curve to calculate the errors .",
    "hence , the present error analyses include circularity among the evaluated quantities and errors .",
    "this circularity means that the results should not be interpreted too rigorously , but are to be used as a guide to the galactic dynamics based on the adopted galactic constants and the assumption of circular rotation .",
