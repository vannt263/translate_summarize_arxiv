    "however , the current general complexity bounds for real solving and nonlinear optimization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are still stated in terms of degree and number of variables , and all but ignore any finer input structure . in this paper , we present new speed - ups for the optimization of certain sparse multivariate polynomials , extended to allow real exponents as well . along the way",
    ", we also present two new families of problems that are @xmath3-complete , i.e. , the analogue of @xmath4-complete for the * bss model over @xmath5*.

    "our framework has both symbolic and numerical aspects in that ( a ) we deal with real number inputs and ( b ) our algorithms give either yes or no answers that are always correct , or numerically approximate answers whose precision can be efficiently tuned .",

    "our main new technique , which may be ofindependent interest , is an extension of @xmath2-discriminants(a.k.a .",

    "our algorithms are quite implementable ( see algorithm [ algor : fsup ] of section [ sub : thresh ] ) and derived via a combination oftropical geometric ideas and @xmath2-discriminant theory , both extended to real exponents .",
    "in particular , for @xmath0-variate @xmath103-nomials , a simple change of variables essentially tells us that tropical geometry rules ( in the form of * viro diagrams * ( * ? ? ? * ch .  5 , pp .",

    "more precisely , an @xmath0-variate @xmath76-nomial @xmath19 ( considered as a function on @xmath85 ) with bounded supremum @xmath106 must attain the value @xmath106 at a critical point of @xmath19 in the nonnegative orthant .",
    "in particular , the nonnegative zero set of @xmath107 must be degenerate , and thus we can attempt to solve for @xmath106 ( and a corresponding maximizer ) if we have a sufficiently tractable notion of discriminant to work with .    so our hardest case reduces to ( a ) finding efficient formulas for discriminants of @xmath0-variate @xmath76-nomials and(b ) efficiently detecting unboundedness for @xmath0-variate @xmath76- nomials . when @xmath108 , ( a ) fortuitously admits a solution , based on a nascent theory developed further in @xcite",
    ". we can also reduce problem ( b ) to problem ( a ) via sometropical geometric tricks .",
    "so our development ultimately hinges deriving an efficient analogue of discriminant polynomials for discriminant varieties that are no longer algebraic .",
    "consider the trivariate pentanomial @xmath109@xmath110 , with @xmath111 @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "has proven quite useful for setting a rigourous foundation .",
