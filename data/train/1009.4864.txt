    "the transverse single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) quantifies the asymmetry of particle production relative to the plane defined by the transverse spin axis and the momentum direction of a polarized hadron .",
    "ssas have come to be recognized as a means of accessing qcd dynamics , both within initial - state hadrons and in the process of hadronization from partons .",
    "large azimuthal transverse single - spin asymmetries of up to @xmath8% were first observed at large feynman-@xmath6 ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the momentum along the beam direction ) in pion production from transversely polarized @xmath1 collisions at @xmath11  gev in 1976 @xcite , contrary to theoretical expectations at the time  @xcite , and subsequently observed in hadronic collisions over a range of energies extending up to @xmath12  gev @xcite . in recent years",
    "numerous measurements of transverse ssas have been performed in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) off a transversely polarized proton or deuteron target as well  @xcite . in order to describe the large transverse ssas observed ,",
    "two approaches have been developed since the 1990s , after early pioneering work by efremov and teryaev @xcite .",
    "one approach requires higher - twist contributions in the collinear factorization scheme , i.e.  the exchange of a gluon between one of the partons taking part in the hard scattering and the color field of either an initial- or final - state hadron .",
    "this was first proposed by qiu and sterman for gluon exchange in the initial state @xcite and by kanazawa and koike for exchange in the final state @xcite .",
    "gluon exchange in either the initial or final state leads to terms including multiparton correlation functions , which can generate a nonzero ssa .",
    "the other approach utilizes parton distribution functions and/or fragmentation functions that are unintegrated in the partonic transverse momentum , @xmath13 ; these functions are generally known as transverse - momentum - dependent distributions ( tmds ) .",
    "these two approaches have different but overlapping kinematic regimes of applicability and have been shown to correspond exactly in their region of overlap @xcite .",
    "while higher - twist parton - nucleon spin - momentum correlation functions and tmds were born within the nucleon structure community , as understanding of them matures , their implications for other areas of qcd are starting to be realized .",
    "@xmath0 production has been extensively studied over the last decades , but the details of the production mechanism remain an open question ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) , and an additional complication is that approximately 30%40% of the measured @xmath0 mesons in hadronic collisions are produced indirectly from feed - down from @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "it was proposed in 2008 by yuan @xcite that within the framework of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , the transverse ssa of @xmath0 production can be sensitive to the @xmath0 production mechanism , assuming a nonzero gluon sivers function @xcite , which is a tmd that describes the correlation between the transverse spin of the proton and the @xmath13 of the partons within it . specifically , yuan predicts that a nonzero gluon sivers function will produce a finite transverse ssa for color - singlet @xmath0 production  @xcite in @xmath1 collisions , but the asymmetry should vanish for color - octet production  @xcite in @xmath1 due to cancelation between initial- and final - state effects , while a nonzero asymmetry for @xmath0 production in sidis is only expected within the color - octet model .",
    "it should be noted that the relationship between the transverse ssa and the production mechanism is not quite as simple in the collinear higher - twist approach , with partial but not full cancelation of terms  @xcite in the cases where the asymmetry uniformly vanishes in the tmd approach presented by yuan .",
    "another important point to note regarding the tmd as compared to the collinear , higher - twist approach is that very recent theoretical work  @xcite suggests that factorization of hard processes in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) into transverse - momentum - dependent distribution and fragmentation functions convoluted with partonic hard - scattering cross sections is not valid for processes involving more than two hadrons .",
    "thus , in the process @xmath16 a gluon sivers function may not be well defined ; however , the definition within a factorized pqcd framework of the corresponding trigluon correlation functions in the collinear , higher - twist approach is believed to be valid .",
    "measurements of heavy flavor transverse ssas in @xmath1 collisions are of interest because they serve to isolate gluon dynamics within the nucleon , with heavy quarks being dominantly produced via gluon - gluon interactions .",
    "very little is presently known about trigluon correlation functions or gluon tmds .",
    "measurements of the transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) spectrum of bottomonium production have been used to extract the @xmath13-unintegrated distribution of gluons in an unpolarized proton @xcite .",
    "similarly , measurements of open heavy flavor transverse ssas have been proposed as a means to isolate gluon tmds and/or their corresponding twist - three gluon correlation functions in polarized protons  @xcite .",
    "a previous phenix measurement of the transverse ssa in neutral pion production at midrapidity @xcite as well as measurements by the compass collaboration of the ssa in semi - inclusive charged hadron production  @xcite , both consistent with zero , have been used to provide initial constraints on the gluon sivers function and suggest that it is small  @xcite , but further data relevant to gluon tmds are greatly needed .    in this paper the first measurement of transverse ssas in @xmath0 production",
    "is presented .",
    "the data were taken by the phenix experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) during the 2006 and 2008 polarized proton runs at @xmath12  gev .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 dependencies are studied , for rapidity regions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , and @xmath17 up to 6 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "transverse single - spin asymmetries lead to modulations of the cross section in the azimuthal angle due to the projection of the polarization vector into the direction of the produced particle .",
    "our measurement is performed in two separate hemispheres referred to as ` left ' and ` right ' where left is defined as the axis which forms a right - handed coordinate system with the beam momentum vector and one of the spin orientations , denoted as @xmath22 . for a vector @xmath23 in the direction of the @xmath22 spin and beam momentum @xmath24 , left is defined as @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the momentum vector of the outgoing particle .",
    "the left - right transverse ssa can be extracted using eq .",
    "( [ eq : an - sigma ] ) .",
    "this equation applies to particle yields observed to the left side of the polarized beam .",
    "@xmath27    where @xmath28 represents the production cross section with beam polarized in the @xmath22 ( @xmath29 ) direction , integrated over the left hemisphere , and @xmath30 is the beam polarization .",
    "an overall minus sign is required for @xmath31 on the right side of the polarized beam .",
    "the geometric scale factor @xmath32 corrects for the convolution of an azimuthal asymmetry with detector acceptance . for a sinusoidal asymmetry ,",
    "as generated by the sivers function , the factor becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the azimuthal angle between the outgoing particle and the proton spin , and @xmath35 is the efficiency for detecting a @xmath0 at a given @xmath34 .",
    "the limits of integration correspond to the hemisphere in which the measurement is being made .",
    "it should be noted that even for a detector with full azimuthal coverage the factor @xmath32 is not unity because we are not determining the amplitude of the modulation directly but measuring an asymmetry which is integrated over entire hemispheres in azimuth .",
    "both proton beams in rhic were polarized . in order to derive single - spin asymmetries , we sum over polarization direction states in one of the two beams : @xmath36 where @xmath37 again indicates the @xmath34-dependent cross section integrated over one hemisphere , and @xmath22 and @xmath29 represent the spin orientations of the two beams .",
    "differences in luminosities can lead to false asymmetries ; see section  [ subsec : method - central ] .",
    "we perform the analysis separately for each beam .",
    "up to 111 out of a possible 120 bunches were filled in each rhic ring , with 106  ns between bunches .",
    "four preset spin patterns with approximately equal numbers of bunches polarized in opposite directions were alternated during the transverse running periods to minimize systematic effects from the injection process .",
    "stores were nominally held for eight hours .",
    "the spin orientation at the phenix interaction point was maintained at the default vertical orientation in the rhic ring for 2008 data taking and rotated to radial orientation for 2006 .    explicitly including the spin orientations of both beams , eq .",
    "( [ eq : an - sigma ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the experimental yields in each spin configuration , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are ratios of the provided luminosities @xmath44 in each spin orientation .",
    "the use of a single polarization factor assumes that bunch polarizations @xmath30 are equal regardless of spin orientation in each beam .",
    "we have also assumed that detector efficiencies are equal for each spin orientation , given that the orientations change every 106 or 212  ns .",
    "beam polarizations at rhic are measured by two different polarimeters , a fast carbon target polarimeter  @xcite for relative polarization measurements and a hydrogen jet polarimeter  @xcite for an absolute measurement .",
    "the carbon target polarimeter is used to measure relative beam polarization store - by - store , and the hydrogen jet polarimeter is used for absolute calibration of the beam polarization . during the 2006",
    "run the average transverse beam polarizations were @xmath45    fill - to - fill variation of beam polarization was @xmath460.03 ( 1 @xmath37 ) for the clockwise beam and @xmath460.04 ( 1 @xmath37 ) for the counterclockwise beam .",
    "the labels represent the direction in which the beam is circulating when looking from above , and the systematic uncertainties are uncorrelated between beams .",
    "there is an additional systematic uncertainty of @xmath47 correlated between the two beams .",
    "the average beam polarizations during the 2008 data taking were @xmath48 each with a fill - to - fill variation of @xmath460.04 ( 1 @xmath37 ) , and with an additional systematic uncertainty of @xmath49 correlated between the beams .",
    "for statistically limited measurements it may be impossible to measure asymmetries using separate yields based on the spin orientation of both beams .",
    "in this case a good approximation can be made using @xmath50 where the spin orientation of the polarized beam is denoted by the arrow , and we have a single relative luminosity @xmath51 .",
    "systematic effects which will be discussed in section  [ subsec : method - central ] can be reduced by bringing @xmath52 to a constant value .",
    "to further simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : an - lumi ] ) we can eliminate all explicit uses of the relative luminosity and calculate a single asymmetry for both the left and right hemispheres using @xmath53 the geometric scale factor @xmath54 is different from the scale factor in eq .",

    "collisions were identified by triggering on a valid collision vertex as measured by the beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite .",
    "muon track candidates were detected at forward and backward rapidities with respect to the polarized beam using two muon spectrometers on the north and south sides of the experiment .",
    "each spectrometer consists of 3 cathode strip tracking chambers in a magnetic field ( mutr ) and 5 layers of iarocci tube planes interleaved with thick steel absorbers ( muid ) .",
    "muon candidates were selected using the bbc trigger in coincidence with combinations of hits in the muid called symsets .",
    "each symset is defined by projecting from the center of the interaction region through a tube in the first layer of the muid to a window of @xmath463 additional tubes in each subsequent layer .",
    "muon candidates are characterized by the depth of their penetration through the muid .",
    "a deep track requires at least one hit of the symset to occur in either the first or second layer and one hit in either the fourth or fifth layer with at least three layers containing hits , while a shallow track requires only one hit in either the first or second layer with at least two hits in the first three layers . in order for a muon to reach the muid it must have a minimum total momentum of @xmath621.9  gev/@xmath5 , and @xmath622.4  gev/@xmath5",

    "neutron candidates were selected by triggering on a coincidence between the bbc trigger and a signal in either the north or south zdc . due to bandwidth restrictions ,",
    "the trigger was prescaled by a factor typically around 100 .",
    "the analysis of the 2006 data used @xmath96 events from radially polarized collisions , and the analysis of the 2008 data used @xmath97 events from vertically polarized collisions .",
    "neutrons were selected offline by requiring an energy deposit in the zdc between 20 and 120  gev along with no hit in the veto scintillator ( less than 1 minimum - ionizing particle ) .",
    "hits were required in both the horizontal and vertical planes of the smd , and neutrons were required to be between 0.3  mrad ( 0.5  cm at the smd ) and 1.4  mrad ( 2.5  cm at the smd ) from the beam .",
    "the asymmetry is calculated using fits to the azimuthal distribution of the neutrons : @xmath98 where @xmath34 is the azimuthal angle relative to vertical , and @xmath99 is the deviation of the polarization from the nominal direction .",
    "the position resolution of the local polarimeter is approximately 1  cm . to determine a systematic uncertainty on the polarization direction ,",
    "fits are performed for @xmath461  cm around the center of the azimuthal neutron distribution ( defined as the position where @xmath75 is maximal ) .",
    "the deviation of the polarization from nominal , in radians , was found to be @xmath100 for the 2006 data and",
    "@xmath101 for the 2008 data .",
    "the polarization directions of the counterclockwise - going beam in 2006 and clockwise - going beam in 2008 were considered to be significant and used in the calculation of @xmath75 for @xmath0 ."
