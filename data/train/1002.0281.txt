    "+ the distribution of @xmath52 for @xmath59 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](b ) .",
    "the large peak near zero is interpreted as being due mainly to isr production of the @xmath51 system , while two - photon - production events would be expected to occur at larger values of @xmath52 .",
    "this is shown explicitly by the distributions of figs .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](c ) and  [ fig : ggsel](d ) , which correspond to the requirements @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](c ) there is a large @xmath58 signal , and a much smaller @xmath62 signal can also be seen . for @xmath34 collisions at a c.m .",
    "energy @xmath32 , the isr production cross section for @xmath58 is about three times larger than for @xmath62 ; also @xmath63 is approximately nine times larger than the corresponding @xmath62 branching fraction value  @xcite .",
    "+ it follows that the observed @xmath58 signal would be expected to be @xmath64 times larger than that for @xmath62 .",
    "the signals in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](c ) seem to be consistent with this expectation , and they are also in agreement with the detailed analysis of isr production of the @xmath51 system in ref .",
    "there is a @xmath57 signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](c ) which is comparable in size to the @xmath62 signal .",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath65 is @xmath66  @xcite , while the product @xmath67 is @xmath68  @xcite , so that the presence of such a @xmath57 signal is consistent with the expected transition rates . for the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and",
    "so a @xmath69 signal of approximately half the size of the @xmath57 signal would be expected in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](c ) ; again the data seem to be in reasonable agreement with this expectation .",
    "+ finally , for the @xmath56 , @xmath71 , and the corresponding signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](c ) would be expected to be about twice the size of the @xmath62 signal .",
    "the @xmath56 signal seems to be larger than that of the @xmath62 , but not by a factor of two ; this may be because the larger energy photon from the @xmath72 transition , when combined with the isr photon , can yield a value of @xmath52 which is larger than @xmath73 . in summary , the signals observed in fig .  [ fig : ggsel](c ) appear consistent with those expected for an isr production mechanism , especially since there is no indication of any remnant of the large @xmath55 of fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](a ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath74 signals in fig .  [",
    "fig : ggsel](c ) are removed by requiring that the transverse momentum of the @xmath51 system be less than @xmath75 ( see discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](d ) below ) , which indicates clearly that they do not result from two - photon production .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](d ) , the @xmath55 signal of fig .  [ fig : ggsel](a ) appears to have survived the @xmath61 requirement in its entirety , and the @xmath56 and @xmath57 signals have been reduced slightly , as discussed in the previous paragraph ; in both fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](a ) and  [ fig : ggsel](d ) there is some indication of a small signal in the region of the @xmath76 mass . a @xmath58 signal of about one third of that in fig .  [ fig : ggsel](a ) is present also in fig .  [ fig : ggsel](d ) .",
    "this is interpreted as being primarily due to a ) the emission of more than one initial state photon , with the consequence that values of @xmath52 greater than @xmath73 are obtained , b ) the isr production of the @xmath62 with subsequent decay to @xmath58 + neutrals , and c ) two - photon - production of the @xmath57 followed by @xmath77 , which has a @xmath78 branching fraction  @xcite .",
    "+ it follows from the above that the requirement @xmath61 significantly reduces isr contributions to the @xmath51 final state while leaving signals associated with two - photon - production essentially unaffected . for this reason , the requirement that @xmath79 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmass ] ) be greater than @xmath73 is chosen as a principal selection criterion for the isolation of events corresponding to @xmath20 . +",
    "as mentioned above , it is expected that for an untagged analysis of @xmath20 , the transverse momentum @xmath46 should be small . in order to quantify this statement , the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](d ) were divided into intervals of @xmath75 in the transverse momentum of the @xmath51 system with respect to the @xmath34 collision axis , which is considered also to be the collision axis for two - photon - production events . for each interval",
    "a fit was made to the @xmath54 mass distribution in the mass region @xmath80 .",
    "the function used consists of a second - order polynomial to describe the background , a gaussian function for the @xmath58 signal and a breit - wigner for the @xmath55 signal convolved with a gaussian to account for the resolution .",
    "the @xmath81-dependence of the resulting @xmath55 yield is shown is fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel2](a ) , and that of the @xmath58 yield is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel2](b ) .",
    "the shapes of the distributions are quite similar for @xmath82 , but the interval from @xmath83 contains @xmath84 more @xmath55 signal events , and that for @xmath85 exhibits an excess of @xmath86 signal events .",
    "this behaviour is expected for two - photon - production of the @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the requirement @xmath87 is imposed as the second principal selection criterion for the extraction of @xmath20 events .",
    "+ since the two - photon reactions @xmath88 and @xmath20 are quasi - exclusive in the sense that only the final state @xmath21 and @xmath22 are undetected it is required in both instances that the total energy deposits @xmath89 in the emc which are unmatched to any charged - particle track be less than @xmath90 .",
    "the net effect is a small reduction in the smooth background .",
    "the histogram of fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel2](c ) corresponds to the @xmath51 candidates of fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel](d ) after requiring @xmath91 and that the emc energy sum be less than @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath81 criterion reduces the @xmath55 signal by a factor @xmath92 , while the @xmath58 signal is reduced by a factor @xmath93 , as is the continuum background at @xmath94 .",
    "more significantly , the continuum background at @xmath95 , just below the @xmath2 threshold , is reduced by a factor @xmath96 .",
    "+ it follows that the net effect of the three principal selection criteria described above ( missing mass @xmath97 , resultant transverse momentum @xmath87 and total energy deposit in the calorimeter @xmath98 ) is to significantly enhance the number of two - photon - production events relative to the events resulting from isr production , continuum production , and combinatoric background .",
    "+ concerning the histogram of fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel2](c ) , the product @xmath99 is @xmath100 times that for the @xmath56 state  @xcite , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel2](c ) the @xmath55 signal contains @xmath101 events ( _ cf_.  the @xmath85 interval of fig .",
    "[ fig : ggsel2](a ) ) , while the @xmath56 signal contains @xmath102  events .",
    "it follows that the signal sizes agree well with the ratio expected on the basis of a two - photon production mechanism . in a similar vein ,",
    "the ratio of the partial width @xmath103 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 is @xmath104  @xcite , so that after taking into account the @xmath105 spin factors , the signals observed in fig .",
