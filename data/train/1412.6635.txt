    "in mathematical population genetics the kingman coalescent is a classical model for describing the genealogies of populations .",
    "if their population size is equal to @xmath1 , the @xmath1-kingman coalescent can be graphically represented as a binary tree which starts with @xmath1 leaves and spends an exponential time @xmath2 with parameter @xmath3 having @xmath4 branches .",
    "the inter - coalescence times are independent .",
    "when labelling the leaves of the tree by @xmath5 one can define the @xmath1-kingman coalescent as a partition - valued process @xmath6 started in the partition @xmath7 of @xmath8 into singletons with the property that , when it is in a state @xmath9 , it jumps after the exponential time @xmath2 to a state obtained by merging two randomly chosen blocks from @xmath9 .",
    "this happens in the coalescent time direction , from the present to the past .    as time runs forwards the population evolves and its genealogy changes , giving rise to a tree - valued process known as the _ evolving kingman coalescent _",
    "( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we consider in this paper populations started at remote past , so to say at time @xmath10 , and driven by the moran model .",
    "this is a stationary , continuous - time evolution model in which each pair of individuals from the population is picked at rate 1 , at which moment one of the individuals dies and the other one gives birth to an offspring , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the evolving coalescent discloses features of the kingman coalescent which are less visible in the static model , when one analyses the tree only at fixed times .",
    "it is worth noting that some aspects of the tree arise from the recent past and others from the more distant past and that for certain functionals of the tree it may not be clear which one of these contributions dominates .",
    "as we shall see , the influence of the recent and the distant past is reflected among others in different time - scales , namely the evolutionary time - scale and the generations time - scale .",
    "we come back to this in more detail below .    ]",
    "particular functionals of coalescent trees such as the total branch length ( the sum of the lengths of all the branches of the tree ) and the total external length ( the sum of the lengths of the external branches ) have been extensively investigated in the literature also due to their statistical relevance in population models including mutations .",
    "the mutation events are modelled as points of a poisson process with constant rate on the branches of the coalescent tree . in",
    "the infinitely many sites model the total tree length controls the total number of mutations seen in the population whereas the total external length controls the number of mutations that affect only single individuals .",
    "the kingman coalescent is one of a big class of coalescent models which have been studied in the literature .",
    "the total length and the external length have been extensively studied for the beta - coalescents .",
    "for the asymptotics in the static case we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the dynamic case ,",
    "the evolving beta@xmath11-coalescent was introduced and investigated for @xmath12 ( the bolthausen - sznitman coalescent ) in @xcite and for @xmath13 in @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the processes of ( centred and rescaled ) total tree length ( for @xmath14 ) and of total external length ( for @xmath13 ) converge in the sense of the finite dimensional distributions to stationary moving average processes with stable distributions .",
    "the time - scale is the generations time - scale for both the total length process and the external length process ( which is obtained by slowing down time by a factor of @xmath15 ) .",
    "as we shall see , this is contrary to the kingman case .",
    "evolving coalescents have also been investigated from a different point of view , namely as evolving metric spaces in ( e.g. ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the total external length process of the evolving kingman - coalescent .",
    "observe that this process is _ stationary _ , a property that it inherits from the stationarity of the moran model .",
    "the next theorem states our main result .",
    "[ mainresult_fdd ] let @xmath16 be the external length of the evolving kingman @xmath1-coalescent at time @xmath17 . then , as @xmath18 @xmath19 where the limiting process @xmath20 is stationary , gaussian , a.s .",
    "continuous , with mean 0 and covariance function @xmath21    this convergence for the one - dimensional case can be read off from janson and kersting @xcite .",
    "let us contrast this result with the theorem of pfaffelhuber , wakolbinger and weisshaupt @xcite , who investigated the process @xmath22 of total tree length of the evolving kingman @xmath1-coalescent :    [ th_pww ] there exists a stationary process @xmath23 with paths in @xmath24 , the space of cdlg functions equipped with the skorokhod topology , such that @xmath25 @xmath26 has a gumbel distribution for all @xmath27 .",
    "moreover @xmath28    theorem [ th_pww ] deals with the original time - scale from the moran model , that is the evolutionary time - scale .",
    "on the contrary , the time in theorem [ mainresult_fdd ] runs on the evolutionary time - scale _ slowed down _ by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "this is what we called the generations time - scale .",
    "note that on the evolutionary time - scale reproduction events happen in the population with a rate of order @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , for large populations , after a time of order @xmath30 each individual will have taken part in a number of reproduction events of order 1 .",
    "it is not surprising that the external length has to be considered on this time - scale",
    ". it might be less obvious that the evolutionary time - scale is the appropriate choice for the total length .",
    "we use the notation @xmath27 for the time on the evolutionary time - scale and @xmath31 for the time points of the generations time - scale .    note also that the limiting process @xmath32 is almost surely continuous , whereas @xmath33 is almost surely made up of jumps .",
    "this reflects the fact that the total length experiences big jumps ( at the times when old families become extinct ) .",
    "for the external length such extremal events do not come into play .",
    "this is also reflected in the type of limiting distributions .",
    "let us point out that the process @xmath33 is not a semimartingale ( @xcite ) , which so far is an open problem for the process @xmath32 .",
    "in the rest of this introduction we outline the proof of our theorem . due to stationarity it suffices to analyse the dynamics of the external length on a time interval @xmath34 with @xmath35 .    for describing the dynamics of the total external length of the kingman coalescent",
    "we recall the notion of branches of order @xmath36 introduced in @xcite . in the coalescent tree",
    "each branch is situated above a subtree .",
    "if this subtree has @xmath36 leaves , one says that the branch is _ of order i_. if @xmath37 the branches are external and if @xmath38 they are internal .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 the total length of order @xmath36 ( the sum of the lengths of branches of order @xmath36 ) in the @xmath1-coalescent belonging to the population alive at time @xmath27 .",
    "let us now look at the dynamics of the total external length . on the generation time - scale",
    "each pair of individuals takes part in a reproduction event at rate @xmath40 .",
    "as long as no reproduction event takes place , the external branches of the coalescent tree grow linearly and hence the external length grows at rate @xmath41 . at the time @xmath42 of a reproducing event",
    ", the total external length process has a jump .",
    "the length of the branch @xmath43 corresponding to the individual that dies and the length of the branch @xmath44 corresponding to the individual that reproduces are subtracted from the total external length .",
    "the branch @xmath43 is removed from the tree , whereas @xmath44 becomes an internal branch of order 2 .",
    "typically , by the removal of @xmath43 , a branch that was internal ( of order 2 ) at time @xmath45 becomes part of an external branch at time @xmath42 ( the exceptional case is when @xmath43 and @xmath44 stem from the same branching event ) .",
    "the length of this branch is then added to the total external length .",
    "note that this piece may become internal again later on due to new reproducing events .",
    "if such an internal branch is part of an external branch at a future time @xmath46 we say that the branch is _ free _ at time @xmath46 .",
    "an example is given in figure [ fig_ext_len_jump ] .    from the tree at time @xmath47 not only internal branches of order 2 may be free at time @xmath46 , but also internal branches of orders greater than 2 .",
    "the lengths of the free branches become part of the external length at time @xmath46 and hence @xmath48 can be written as [ ext_len_decomp ] ^n_h= _ i=1^n-1 ^n , i ^n , i_0 + i^n_0,h , where by @xmath49 we denote the ( random ) proportion of the length @xmath50 of order @xmath36 that is free by time @xmath46 and by @xmath51 the external length of the coalescent at time @xmath46 arising in the time interval @xmath34 .",
    "are marked in ( dashed ) blue . at time @xmath42 a reproduction event happens and the tree changes .",
    "the external branches at time @xmath52 are shown in figure b ) with the following code : the ( dashed ) blue pieces make up the part of the external length from time @xmath53 that is still external at time @xmath52 , the red ( dash and dot ) piece is a branch that was internal at time @xmath53 and became free at time @xmath42 , while the orange ( dotted ) pieces represent the external length @xmath54 gathered in the time interval @xmath55    a key role in the analysis of the external length process is played by the main result of @xcite which states that for any @xmath56 and any @xmath57 , as @xmath18 @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the @xmath60-identity matrix and [ expectation_l ] _",
    "i=(^n , i_h)=    let us label the individuals alive at time @xmath47 by @xmath5 and denote by @xmath61 the power set of @xmath8",
    ". for @xmath62 denote @xmath63 with the convention @xmath64 if there is no such branch in the coalescent and @xmath65 observe that with these notations @xmath66 and thus the @xmath36-th summand on the right - hand side of ( [ ext_len_decomp ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath67 for any fixed @xmath68 we can write as [ ext_len_decomp_1 ] ^n_h= _ a _ n 1 |a| r _",
    "f_a l_a + r^n , r_h+ i^n_0,h , where [ def_r ] r^n , r_h:= _ a _ n r<|a|<n _",
    "f_a l_a records the contribution of the lengths of the branches of orders larger than @xmath69 to the external length at time @xmath46 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ mainresult_fdd ] will show that for large @xmath69 it is only the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ ext_len_decomp_1 ] ) that makes a non - negligible contribution to the external length at time @xmath46 .",
    "note moreover that this sum is obtained by a random thinning ( by means of the indicators @xmath70 ) of the lengths @xmath71 of order at most @xmath69 . in section [ normality_thinned_sum ]",
    "we prove a general result , which assures that if a sum of ( possibly dependent ) random variables converging in distribution to a normal - distributed random variable , is endowed with independent random coefficients , then the sum obtained through this procedure continues to be asymptotically gaussian .",
    "the result of @xcite provides the asymptotic normality assumption on the initial sums @xmath71 .",
    "the second key idea of the paper is that the _ freeing_-mechanism described above can be coupled in a natural way with a birth and death process started with @xmath72 individuals at time 0 .",
    "this allows to replace the original thinning procedure by another one which provides independent coefficients .",
    "moreover , the coupling is also used in the investigation of the contributions that the branches carrying a large number of leaves make to the evolving external length ( in section [ proof of the proposition ] ) .",
    "the coupling is presented in section [ a birth and death process ] .",
    "the third building block of the proof of our main result is a new description of the coalescent tree structure ( also called the tree topology ) .",
    "this is obtained by neglecting the exponential lengths of the branches .",
    "then the whole tree structure is captured by the random variables @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath62 , where @xmath73 is the level in the coalescent at which the branch carrying the leaves with labels in the set @xmath75 is formed and @xmath74 is the level at which this branch ends ( with the convention that @xmath76 if no such branch exists in the coalescent ) . we show that these quantities ( and not the exponential times ) play the central role in the development of the external length .",
    "we examine them in detail in section [ lower and upper levels ] .    building on this preparatory work and on fu s estimates",
    "@xcite we deal in section [ proof of the proposition ] with the expectation and variance of the length contributed to the evolving external length by the large families from the coalescent at time 0 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ mainresult_fdd ] is then completed in section [ proof of the main result ] .",
    "putting the building blocks described above together one more idea is needed for the proof , namely it is necessary to distinguish between the contributions to the evolving external length coming from the possible freeing of the internal lengths that are in small , medium - sized and respectively large depth of the tree .",
    "it turns out that for the contributions of the first and the latter groups of branches one can easily replace the freeing procedures by procedures dictated by independent birth and death processes ( for each branch separately ) . in the case of the second group of internal branches ( defined as the branches crossing a given fixed level in the tree )",
    ", it holds that the sets of leaves carried by these branches are all disjoint .",
    "this property allows us to apply the coupling from section [ a birth and death process ] for all branches in the group simultaneously in order to obtain independent coefficients for the thinning . by the replacement of the freeing - mechanism through independent birth and death processes",
    "we also obtain the formula for the covariance of the limiting gaussian process : @xmath77 is simply the probability that a critical birth and death process starting with one individual at time 0 has one individual at time @xmath46 .    _",
    "_ we recall the vinogradov notation : @xmath78 we use this notation instead of the o - notation since for voluminous formulas it is easier to read .",
    "moreover we denote throughout by @xmath79 a finite constant whose value is not important and may change from line to line .",
    "the following proposition contains a general statement of the form : if the sum of not necessarily independent random variables is asymptotically normal then this property persists if the summands are supplied with independent random coefficients .",

    "if the following two conditions hold : for each @xmath82 @xmath90 then @xmath91    the characteristic function of the sum @xmath92 is @xmath93    using the fact that for complex numbers @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 and @xmath97 for all @xmath4 it holds that @xmath98 we obtain by denoting the expectation and variance of @xmath99 by @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively that @xmath102 and by using a taylor expansion that @xmath103    by assumption @xmath104 converges in probability to 0 as @xmath18 .",

    "note that we may interchange the limits in @xmath69 and @xmath1 since proposition [ proposition_bigger_r ] gives an uniform estimate in @xmath69 .",
