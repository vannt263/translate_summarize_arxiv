    "<S> we investigate vector meson spectral functions at finite temperature and density through the soft wall model , a bottom - up holographic approach to qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we find narrow resonances at small values of the parameters , becoming broader as temperature and density increase . </S>",
    "<S> we study dissociation of such states , occurring when no peak can be distinguished in the spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a decreasing of the mass of vector mesons at increasing temperature and density . finally , a discussion of these results is presented .    </S>",
    "<S> ads / qcd , vector mesons , spectral functions , finite temperature and density    the properties of vector mesons in a hot and dense medium can be studied by looking at their spectral functions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , these objects carry information about the existence of bound states or resonances , their mass and width , and also about the properties of the medium , since transport coefficients and hydrodynamical quantities can be inferred from their low - energy behaviour .    the analysis of spectral functions at finite temperature and density is complicated , and still needs more hints ; for a review of theoretical and experimental results , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we compute spectral functions in a holographic bottom - up approach to qcd . </S>",
    "<S> holographic means that it is inspired by the ads / cft correspondence , a conjecture put forward by maldacena in 1997 @xcite stating that there is a duality between two different theories living in two different spacetimes : one is type iib string theory living in a ten dimensional curved space , ads@xmath0 , ads@xmath1 being a five - dimensional anti - de sitter space and @xmath2 a five - dimensional sphere ; the other theory is @xmath3=4 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory living in a four - dimensional minkowski space . </S>",
    "<S> the metric of the ads@xmath1 space can be written through conformal coordinates : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radius and @xmath6 the fifth coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the ads space has a boundary , which is a minkowski space and is defined by @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the name _ cft _ underlines the property of conformal invariance characterising the gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> the duality is accomplished by the identification of the coupling constants of the two theories and by the relation between the radius of the ads space and the t hooft coupling of the gauge theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> standing these two relations , a very important property of the correspondence follows : the supergravity limit of the string theory , which means very small coupling and very large radius , is dual to the limit of large @xmath8 and large t hooft coupling in the gauge theory . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the non - perturbative regime of the gauge theory is dual to a semiclassical theory in a curved spacetime . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , it can be interesting to study possible applications of such a conjecture to qcd , and try to compute some non - perturbative quantities through a perturbative approach . </S>",
    "<S> the models that have been introduced so far attempt to make the conjecture suitable for qcd , which , at odds with @xmath3=4 sym theory , is neither supersymmetric nor conformal . in particular , a bottom - up approach will be followed , in which a five - dimensional theory is phenomenologically constructed , according to the dictionary established in @xcite : for each local gauge - invariant operator in the gauge theory there is a proper five - dimensional field , and its mass is related to the conformal dimension of the operator . here </S>",
    "<S> the soft - wall model will be used @xcite , in which conformal symmetry is broken by inserting a non - dynamical _ dilaton - like _ field in the action , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 . in this way , a mass scale , @xmath11 , is introduced in the model , while the choice of @xmath12 is the simplest that can give regge trajectories in hadron spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as an example , vector mesons can be analytically investigated , and , from the mass of the @xmath13 meson the parameter @xmath11 can be fixed : @xmath11=388 mev . </S>",
    "<S> + we are interested in studying finite temperature and density effects . in the five - dimensional theory </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to modify the ads space by adding a charged black - hole . </S>",
    "<S> temperature and density are related to the position of the black - hole and its charge . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath14 is introduced , dual to the qcd operator @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting metric , known as the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) metric , has the following expression : @xmath16 @xmath17 with @xmath18 , proportional to the black - hole charge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fifth coordinate @xmath6 is now bounded , @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the outer horizon of the black hole , i.e. the lowest value of @xmath6 such that @xmath21 .    in this phenomenological model , </S>",
    "<S> we assume the following solution for @xmath14 @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 a parameter @xcite , which verifies the condition required by the ads / cft correspondence that the source ( @xmath24 ) of the operator ( @xmath15 ) must be equal to the boundary value of the five - dimensional field ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> temperature and density are linked to the black - hole parameters ( @xmath20 and @xmath26 ) in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> temperature is defined by ( hawking temperature ) @xmath27 the chemical potential is given by requiring a boundary condition on @xmath28 , stating that the field must vanish on the black - hole horizon ( @xmath29 ) , obtaining @xmath30 one can notice that both temperature and chemical potential are inverse functions of @xmath20 , so the larger the space along the @xmath6-axis ( black - hole horizon is far from the ads boundary ) , the lower the temperature and chemical potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the objects we want to study through the model described so far are vector mesons . in the gauge theory , this corresponds to consider the local gauge - invariant operator @xmath31 ( @xmath32 are the gell - mann matrices ) ; the field dual to such operator is a gauge vector field @xmath33 described by the action @xmath34\\,;\\ ] ] @xmath35 is the determinant of the metric and @xmath36 are five - dimensional indices . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 is the strength tensor field ( assuming a quadratic approximation for the action ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath38 is fixed by a comparison of the perturbative terms of the two - point correlation functions in qcd and in the soft - wall model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the gauge @xmath39 . given the action , the euler - lagrange equation of motion for @xmath40 in the fourier space reads @xmath41 the analysis of vector meson properties in a medium proceeds in two different ways , according to the values of temperature and density . in case of very small values , a standard analysis , based on solving the equation of motion and looking for normalizable solutions , can be adopted , since the problem is very similar to the zero - density and zero - temperature case . on the other hand , when temperature and/or density become sizeable , a different method , based on the computation of spectral functions , is needed .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first focus on the first case . </S>",
    "<S> as already pointed out , very small values of temperature and chemical potential correspond to very high values of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a bogoliubov transformation @xmath42 , @xmath43 , such that eq . </S>",
    "<S> becomes @xmath44 @xmath45 we solve this schrdinger - like equation , with boundary conditions @xmath46 and @xmath40 normalizable , and find the eigenvalue , which is the mass of vector meson . </S>",
    "<S> this method can be used as long as @xmath20 is high enough that solutions of the equation of motion for the vector field vanish before reaching the black - hole horizon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eigen ] shows some examples of such solutions at @xmath47=0.05@xmath11 and some values of chemical potential ( using @xmath23=1 ) ; the green dash - dotted curve ( @xmath48 ) represents a limit case , since @xmath20 is small enough to influence the solutions . for higher values of chemical potential </S>",
    "<S> , this method can not be used anymore .     and some values of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23=1 has been used.,width=264 ]    the other method consists in computing spectral functions , which are defined as the imaginary part of the retarded green s function , which is in turn given by @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the bulk - to - boundary propagator and the source , respectively , of the vector field in the fourier space , defined by @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 is the action in . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion for the bulk - to - boundary propagator is the same as for the vector field @xmath54 in , but the boundary conditions are that @xmath55=1 and that near the black - hole horizon it must behave as the _ falling in _ solution : @xmath56{z\\to z_h } ( 1-z / z_h)^{-i\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega^2}\\ , z_h}{2(2-q^2)}}\\left(1+{\\cal o}(1-z / z_h)\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] a condition which ensures to get in the end the retarded green s function , rather than the advanced one @xcite . in figs .

    "<S> @xmath23=1 has been used.,width=264 ]    the position of the peaks of the spectral functions corresponds to the mass of resonances , in particular the first peak represents the ground state and the second one the first excited state . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of raising temperature and/or density is to shift peaks towards small energies and make them broader , so the mass decreases and the width increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is evident in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mass]-[fig : width ] , where masses and widths are plotted versus temperature and chemical potential , in units of @xmath11 . at small temperature and density the width is zero and the mass is the eigenvalue of eq . , while at higher values they are extracted from the spectral functions , by fitting each peak with a modified breit - wigner function @xmath57     meson as a function of temperature and density . </S>",

    "<S> all quantities are in units of @xmath11 ; @xmath23=1 has been used.,width=264 ]    an important feature of the spectral functions computed in this model is that they grow as @xmath58 at large energy , which is the expected behaviour @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they also show that excited states melt at lower temperature and desity with respect to the ground state , since the second peak disappears before the first .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , the analysis of vector meson spectral functions in the soft wall model suggests that their width increases as temperature and density increase , meaning that these states become unstable , and their mass slightly decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the first result is exactly what we expected , and what other models and experiments find . for the second one , </S>",
    "<S> there is not a clear expectation , since many models and experiments support different outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a dropping scenario has been predicted in @xcite , while a mass - increase in @xcite . from the experimental point of view , data in @xcite are compatible with a small increase of the mass , whereas the analyses in @xcite have found no significant effect . </S>",
    "<S> a wider and more quantitative discussion on these results can be found in @xcite . </S>"
