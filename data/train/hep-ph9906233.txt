    "the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model is a well motivated framework@xcite for exploring the experimental consequences of weak scale supersymmetry . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that supersymmetry breaking occurs in a `` hidden sector '' of the model , and is then communicated to the observable sector via gravitational  strength interactions . motivated by the observed suppression of flavor changing neutral currents as well as by the near unification of gauge coupling constants at @xmath6 gev , one assumes a common mass @xmath7 for scalars and a common mass @xmath8 for gauginos at scale @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the soft breaking trilinear @xmath10 terms are also unified to @xmath11 at @xmath9 .",
    "the soft susy breaking parameters , gauge and yukawa couplings are then evolved from @xmath9 to @xmath12 via renormalization group equations .",
    "the magnitude of the superpotential @xmath13 term is determined by requiring radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry ; this latter constraint also effectively allows one to trade the bilinear @xmath14 parameter for the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the entire spectrum of susy and higgs particle masses ( as well as all the couplings ) is predicted in terms of standard model ( sm ) parameters augmented by the susy parameter set @xmath16 this model , along with several others , has been incorporated into the event generator isajet@xcite .",
    "the negative results of sparticle searches in experiments at the tevatron and at lep have led to significant lower limits on gluino and chargino masses . in the msugra framework and in other models with ( real or apparent )",
    "gaugino mass unification , the lep2 limit on chargino mass @xmath17 gev@xcite implies that gluinos and most squarks ought to have masses typically greater than about 300 gev , so that strong sparticle production at the tevatron is expected to be suppressed .",
    "then , @xmath1 and @xmath2 production is expected to be the dominant sparticle production mechanism if sparticles are at all accessible .",
    "it has become increasingly clear that the trilepton signal from @xmath18 followed by @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is one of the most promising discovery channels for supersymmetry at luminosity upgrades of the fermilab tevatron collider@xcite . as an illustration , in fig .",
    "[ siga ] , we plot sparticle cross sections as a function of @xmath22 assuming five generations of degenerate squarks , for _ a _ ) @xmath23 and _ b _ ) @xmath24 , assuming @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( mssm parameters with gaugino mass unification ) .",
    "the region to the left of the vertical line is excluded by the lep2 chargino mass limit @xmath17 gev@xcite .",
    "it can be seen that electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos dominates over the strongly produced @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 cross sections over essentially all of parameter space for which @xmath30 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath31 is relatively suppressed because @xmath32 is dominantly a hypercharge gaugino and so couples to @xmath33 via its suppressed components , while the squark or gluino plus chargino or neutralino associated production reactions ( summed over all sparticle types and shown by dash - dot - dot curves ) occur at smaller rates .",
    "these qualitative features hold for both frames shown .",
    "similar results are shown in fig .",
    "[ sigb ] for @xmath34 . in this case , for low values of @xmath35 with @xmath36 , the strong production cross sections can be dominant , but only in parameter space regions already excluded by lep2 . since opposite sign dilepton or jet plus lepton signals from @xmath1 production",
    "suffer from large standard model backgrounds , many groups have focussed on the clean trilepton signature from @xmath2 production for which the sm background is expected to be small : after suitable cuts , this mainly comes from @xmath37 or @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 or @xmath41 decay leptonically .",
    "the tevatron reach in this channel has been extensively examined especially for low values of @xmath15 where the effect of yukawa interactions is negligible . in parts of parameter space of the msugra model ( including those favored by predicting a big bang relic abundance of lightest neutralinos in the cosmologically interesting range@xcite ) , the reach is very large because neutralino leptonic decay rates can be enhanced owing in part to relatively light sleptons mediating the decay chain .",
    "however , in other regions of parameter space , these same decays can be suppressed by large negative interference terms between the @xmath42 and slepton exchange graphs@xcite , and there is no reach even if charginos are just beyond the lep bound .",
    "if the msugra parameter @xmath15 is large , then @xmath43 and @xmath44 yukawa couplings become non - negligible as well , and as a result , @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be significantly lighter than first and second generation sleptons and squarks .",
    "consequently , chargino and neutralino decays to @xmath43-leptons and @xmath44-quarks can be enhanced over decays to their first and second generation counterparts .",
    "if the decays @xmath47 and @xmath48 are strongly enhanced , trilepton events ( where @xmath49 or @xmath13 are secondaries from @xmath43 decays ) can still occur at a considerable rate , but then @xmath49s and @xmath13s will have a much softer energy distribution making the detection of the signal more challenging . hence , unless hadronically decaying taus can be detected with high efficiency and purity , the tevatron reach for msugra in general becomes more limited for high values of @xmath15  @xcite .    because of the importance of this channel , considerable attention was focussed on optimizing cuts to maximize the tevatron susy discovery potential during the recent fermilab tevatron `` workshop on susy / higgs particles at run 2 . ''",
    "barger , kao and li @xcite pointed out that using softer lepton @xmath5 cuts for susy trilepton events could improve the expected susy signal to background levels by a significant margin , particularly for scenarios with large values of @xmath15 . in addition@xcite ,",
    "the signal level could be increased significantly relative to background by allowing jetty events into the trilepton signal sample , and the greatest reach was shown to be obtained via this _ inclusive _ trilepton channel .",

    "@xcite using soft cuts , and was found to have increased significantly beyond the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where harder lepton cuts ( originally devised for the signal at low @xmath15 ) and a jet veto were used .",
    "it has recently been pointed out@xcite that these studies neglected contributions from @xmath50 production where the @xmath42 boson was allowed to be off mass shell .",
    "these authors included backgrounds from @xmath51 production using pythia , and looked to optimize cuts for susy trilepton signals over background throughout the msugra model parameter space .",
    "in fact , in much of parameter space , they found hard lepton cuts were optimal since they could remove more of the @xmath51 background that was incompletely removed by a @xmath42-boson mass veto .",
    "recently , the event generator isajet ( v 7.44 ) has been upgraded to include decay matrix elements for chargino , neutralino and gluino three - body decays . in previous versions , while the computation of branching fractions had included these matrix elements , just phase space was used in the event generation to determine the energy and momentum distributions of their decay products . in practice , because various kinematic cuts are placed on each of the three signal leptons in order to extract signal from background , the resultant signal rates can in fact depend on the momentum and energy distributions of the decay leptons .",
    "this neglect of the matrix element becomes an especially poor approximation when the mass of the gauge boson mediating the decay approaches that of the parent neutralino or chargino .",
    "moreover , as has recently been pointed out by nojiri and yamada@xcite , distributions in dilepton invariant mass @xmath52 can be sensitive ( due to matrix element effects ) to susy particle masses and mixings .",
    "these can affect not only the overall @xmath52 distribution shape , but also the determination of the distribution endpoint , which yields an important measure of the mass difference @xmath53 .",
    "in light of these various developments , and the importance of the trilepton signal to susy searches at the tevatron , we felt it was worthwhile to update our calculations for the reach of fermilab tevatron upgrades for the msugra model via the trilepton channel .",

    "the trilepton event cross sections after cuts for cases 1 - 5 introduced above are shown in table iv for the five sets of cuts introduced in table  i. for the soft cuts the signal with sc1 exceeds sc2 because of the additional @xmath41 and @xmath33-veto requirements .",
    "while these reduce the signal by 40 - 50% , the corresponding reduction in the background is by a factor of 35 ( mainly due to the reduction of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 backgrounds ) . comparing with the bg rates from table  ii",
    ", we see that with 2 fb@xmath101 none of the cases are observable at the @xmath100 level using cuts sc1 !",
    "using cut set sc2 , only case 1 is visible with 2 fb@xmath101 while cases 1 , 3 and 4 should be observable at tev33 . for the hard cuts ,",
    "it is clear that the set hc2 performs better than the set hc1 : at tev33 , cases 1 and 4 are observable using hc2 in contrast to just case 1 via hc1 . production .",
    "in contrast , for case 1 , 83% ( 71% ) of the signal with hc1 ( hc2 ) cuts originates in the @xmath2 process . ]",
    "notice also that with sc3 cuts none of the signal cases are observable with just 2  fb@xmath101 of integrated luminosity , and only case 3 is observable at tev33 .",
    "this is , of course , to be expected for the low @xmath15 cases 1 and 4 , and for case 5 since neutralinos then decay to os / sf dileptons .",
    "the point , however , is that although these cuts reduce the background very significantly , the corresponding loss of the signal is simply too large to make this strategy very promising even at tev33 .",
    "while these cuts offer the best signal to background ratio for cases 2 and 3 , the significance @xmath144 is worse than that for cuts sc2 in case 2 , and in case 3 the two sets of cuts give about the same statistical significance . in some regions of parameter space cuts sc3",
    "may thus be useful as a diagnostic once a signal has been found , but they do not increase the reach .",
    "we conclude that over a large part of the parameter space , the inclusive soft cuts set sc2 appear to provide the best strategy for extracting the trilepton signal , since the dominant @xmath3 and @xmath4 backgrounds are largely reduced by the three extra cuts included here .",
    "it may , however , be that the cuts hc2 may provide a somewhat better reach for sufficiently large values of @xmath8 ( and sometimes a better signal to background ratio ) .    finally , to illustrate the impact of the matrix element , we also list in table  iv the cross section for the inclusive signal with soft cuts set sc1 but _ without _ the decay matrix elements included ; _",
    "i.e. _ as it was computed prior to the release of isajet 7.44 .",
    "of course , there is no change for the first three cases as three body decays of the chargino and neutralino were not important , but for cases 4 and 5 , the inclusion of decay matrix elements decreases the predicted observable event rate by 10 - 15% .",
    "we have also shown the signals for cases a , b and c corresponding to msugra parameters in figs .",
    "[ ptl1 ] , [ ptl2 ] and [ ptl3 ] , respectively .",
    "although the cross section is unobservably small except in case a , we have shown these as additional examples that enable the reader to gauge the importance of the matrix element effect for the evaluation of the reach .",
    "we see that as expected from figs .",
    "[ ptl1 ] and [ ptl2 ] , the matrix element has little effect for cases a and b. for case c , fig .",
    "[ ptl3 ] would suggest that there should be a substantial increase in the cross section when matrix elements are included as these cause a substantial hardening of the lepton @xmath5 distributions ; we see , however , that the cross section is substantially reduced .",
    "this is because , as we saw from fig .",
    "[ point3 ] , the matrix element causes the masses of the dileptons from @xmath66 decays to peak near to @xmath125 , so that these events are removed by the @xmath42-veto .",
    "we conclude that at least for the soft cuts considered here , matrix element effects generally do not alter the signal cross section by more than 10 - 20% except for small regions of parameter space where a three - body decay is close to becoming a quasi two body decay .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite this is not , however , the case for dilepton mass ( and presumably other ) distributions which we consider next .",
    "it is known that the mass distribution of same flavor , opposite sign dileptons can provide important information about neutralino , and possibly also slepton , masses .",
    "this distribution has recently been studied in ref.@xcite where interesting effects arising from the matrix element have been pointed out . the magnitude and nature of these effects is sensitive to underlying parameters , and so can ( in some cases ) provide an additional tool to obtain these . here",
    ", we examine this distribution for the five cases that we have examined in detail , incorporating the inclusive soft cuts sc2 which for the five case studies yield the largest reach at luminosity upgrades of the tevatron .",
    "in several of the cases the leptons arise as secondaries from the decay of the parent tau that is produced via the decay of @xmath66 . in this case , the dilepton mass distribution will be squeezed to lower mass values , and the sharp edge that directly provides information about sparticle masses is washed out . nevertheless , we show these distributions as they illustrate what might be expected in such susy scenarios even though they only roughly yield information about neutralino or slepton masses .    in fig .",
    "[ mll ] , we show the resulting dilepton mass distribution after the cuts sc2 and with the backgrounds included .",
    "the frames are labelled by the corresponding case number .",
    "the final histogram labelled bg shows the distribution from the various backgrounds shown in table ii with the same set of cuts .",
    "the rise at low @xmath124 is due to the tail of the @xmath4 background discussed earlier .",
    "this will obscure the determination of the lower end point of this distribution .",
    "the sharp cut off at the high end is from the @xmath42-veto cut  without this , the distribution has a huge peak at @xmath145 .    for case 1 , the trilepton signal is large and a mass endpoint may be visible even at run 2 where @xmath146 signal events are expected . in this case , @xmath147 via a real @xmath116 , so an edge is expected at @xmath148 and is clearly visible in the plot . with an integrated luminosity of 25  fb@xmath101",
    "a moderately precise measurement of the end point should be possible .",
    "for case 2 , there should be a similar edge  but in the @xmath149 distribution  at 54.5 gev .",
    "dileptons from the subsequent @xmath43 leptonic decays should also respect this bound , but with a softened mass distribution .",
    "indeed this appears to be the case when compared against the pure background distribution shown in the last frame : there is some signal enhancement beyond the sm expectation for dilepton masses ranging between about 2550 gev .",
    "we note , however , that when two of the three leptons are secondaries of taus from the neutralino in @xmath2 production , there is no reason to expect that the leptons from @xmath66 decay should have the same flavour .",
    "in fact in events where a tau each decays into @xmath49 and @xmath13 , the same flavour pair necessarily comes in association with a lepton from elsewhere ( here from chargino decay ) and so should not be expected to respect this end point ( except that the mass is small as the daugter lepton from tau will usually be soft ) .",
    "furthermore , for case 2 , production of charged sleptons and/or sneutrinos and , to a lesser extent heavier charginos and neutralinos , make significant contributions to the trilepton signal , frequently without any @xmath66 in the cascade .",
    "we thus expect no sharp edges and no real structure to the @xmath124 distribution for this case .",
    "moreover , the event sample will be quite limited even with 25 fb@xmath101 of integrated luminosity since less than 20 signal events ( and a comparable number of background events ) make up the plot .",
    "extraction of information on neutralino or slepton masses from this distribution appears to be very difficult .",
    "it might , however , be interesting to examine the possibility of constructing the mass edge using identified hadronically decaying @xmath43 s ; since this clearly depends on detector capabilities , we have not attempted to do so .",
    "case 3 should be very similar to case 2 as here , @xmath66 again essentially always decays via @xmath150 . in this case",
    "we expect @xmath149 should be bounded by 47 gev . as in case 2 , the trilepton signal originates in many different susy sources . aside from the usual @xmath2 production ,",
    "third generation squarks and slepton / sneutrino production contribute significantly to this sample with smaller contributions from other susy reactions .",
    "it is interesting to see that the dilepton mass reconstruction again ( mostly ) respects the bound @xmath151 ; cases 2 and 3 clearly show the care that must be exercised before inferring the origin of susy trilepton events _ even though the @xmath124 distribution clusters in a limited range . _",
    "extraction of precision mass information from this distribution again seems very difficult .    in case 4 , @xmath147 via virtual particles , so we expect @xmath124 to be bounded by @xmath152 gev . the mass edge , though not as sharp as in case 1 , is evident in the figure .",
    "it should , of course , be remembered that the signal cross section is just 2.1  fb so that a substantial integrated luminosity will be needed to extract @xmath53 with any precision .    finally , in case 5",
    ", dileptons can occur from @xmath66 via virtual sparticles or virtual @xmath42 , and also from @xmath153 decays via a real @xmath45 . in the @xmath124 distribution shown in the figure",
    "we expect a mass edge at @xmath154 gev . the decay @xmath155 will likewise have a @xmath149 edge at 39 gev with a correspondingly softer dilepton mass distribution .",
    "while there is a slight dip in the distribution at @xmath156  gev , a clear mass edge does not appear evident .",
    "note that with 25 fb@xmath101 of integrated luminosity , only about 15 signal events will be used to create this plot , so the statistical sample will be very limited .",
    "this scenario is further complicated by the fact that both @xmath2 and @xmath141 production is substantial .",
    "extraction of masses , though possible in principle , appears to be difficult",
    ". it would be interesting to examine whether the detection of a signal with taus identified via their hadronic decays would make it possible to identify the additional presence of @xmath153 in the susy event sample .",
    "in this section , we use the augmented cut sets sc2 and hc2 ( which effectively removed the bulk of the new backgrounds evaluated here ) to calculate the susy trilepton signal , and thereby determine the reach of tevatron upgrades in the parameter space of the msugra model .",
    "we present results for @xmath157 , since much of the parameter space for @xmath158 and low @xmath15 is ruled out by the recent lep2 bound on the mass of the higgs boson . for large values of @xmath15 ,",
    "the reach plots become similar regardless of the sign of @xmath13 .",
    "we note that values of @xmath158 also seem to be disfavored from comparing model predictions for @xmath159 decay rates@xcite to experimental results from cleo@xcite and aleph@xcite .    in earlier studies @xcite ,",

    "increasing @xmath15 by just one unit , to @xmath26 , typically raises the value of @xmath163 by 10 gev , placing it beyond the current reach of lep2 higgs searches .    to illustrate the reach of the tevatron for low @xmath15 values not accessible at lep2",
    ", we evaluate the observability of the susy trilepton signal for @xmath164 and show our results in fig .",

    "the reach of the tevatron with 25 fb@xmath101 typically extends to @xmath170 gev , corresponding to @xmath171 gev and @xmath172 gev . coincidentally , this is the same as the @xmath173 reach@xcite quoted for the _ clean _",
    "@xmath84 channel ( but neglecting the @xmath3 and @xmath4 backgrounds ) . for @xmath26 ,",

    "are shown for the same parameter planes using the cuts hc2 in figs .",
    "[ pam3nh ] and [ pam35h ] .",
    "qualitatively , much of the reach is similar , although hc2 work better in fig .",
    "[ pam3nh ] around @xmath180 gev and large @xmath8 ( where the signal leptons are expected to be hard ) , whereas sc2 work better at very low @xmath7 ( where the mass difference between the sleptons and @xmath32 is small ) . in fig .",
    "[ pam35h ] , we see that sc2 work better at low @xmath7 where the trileptons occur dominantly from cascade decays involving @xmath43 leptons . for large @xmath7 ,",
    "the @xmath66 decays are dominated by the @xmath42 exchange graph . in this case , hc2 work slightly better at very large @xmath8 .",
    "further optimization of cuts is possible as already noted .",
    "within the msugra model ( or any framework with a common gaugino mass at a high scale @xmath181 ) , the lep2 bound @xmath182  gev translates to @xmath183  gev . in this case , electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos is the dominant sparticle production process at the tevatron , and the trilepton signal from @xmath2 production assumes even greater importance than in the past .",
    "it has recently been emphasized that the susy reach via this channel can be increased by softening the @xmath5 requirements on the leptons , and further , by _ not _ imposing a jet veto on these events .",
    "in contrast to these developments that enhance the reach relative to previous projections , it has also been pointed out that @xmath184 production , which had been omitted in previous analyses , is a major source of sm background to the trilepton signal ; the inclusion of this new background of course reduces the reach . moreover , as the @xmath124 spectrum from susy events [ see figs .",
    "[ point1]-[point3 ] ] extends to very low values , sm background from @xmath69 background ( which had never been evaluated before ) needed to be incorporated .",
    "finally , previous studies of the trilepton signal ignored the effect of the chargino and neutralino decay matrix elements in the evaluation of the energy and angular distributions of the leptons .",
    "while these do not alter total rates , the rates after experimental cuts can be changed .",
    "recently , the tree level decay matrix elements have been included in the event generator isajet which is often used to compute the susy signal . in view of these developments and also the importance of the susy trilepton signal , we felt a re - assessment of the signal was warranted .",
    "an improved calculation of the tevatron reach via this channel is the main subject of this paper .    for the soft inclusive cuts used here ,",
    "incorporation of the matrix elements , for the most part , changes the signal cross sections by less than @xmath185% so that the conclusions about signal levels from other studies where these are ignored should be qualitatively correct .",
    "this is not to say matrix element effects are always unimportant .",
    "first , there are regions of parameter space where the matrix elements do qualitatively change the distributions ( _ e.g. _ case c in sec .",
    "iii ) , and hence , signal cross sections .",
    "more importantly , matrix element effects can considerably distort the distribution of same flavor opposite sign dileptons in susy trilepton events from which important information about neutralino , and perhaps also slepton , masses may be obtained .",
    "this issue may be even more important for susy studies at @xmath186 linear colliders or at the lhc where , because of the clean environment and/or the large rates , the extraction of sparticle masses is an integral part of the susy program .    turning to our main purpose",
    ", we have shown that augmenting previously proposed soft or hard cuts with additional cuts designed to reduce @xmath69 and @xmath51 backgrounds can still lead to substantial regions of parameter space where the trilepton signal should be observable at tevatron upgrades .",
    "our updated projection of the tevatron reach via the trilepton channel is summarized in figs .",
    "[ pam3n ] , [ pam35n ] , [ pam3nh ] and [ pam35h ] for both low and high @xmath15 , as well as hard and soft lepton @xmath5 cuts .",
    "soft cuts perform slightly better for the anticipated luminosity of run ii .",
    "however , with 25  fb@xmath101 of data , the hard cuts can extend the reach towards larger values of the gaugino mass parameter @xmath8 , for some values of the scalar mass parameter @xmath7 .",
    "it is noteworthy that a @xmath187 signal at run ii requires a signal to background ratio of at least 3.5 to 1 ( 5 to 1 for the hard cuts ) .",
    "in contrast , at tev33 and with soft cuts , signal and background are about equal at the @xmath187 discovery limit : a good knowledge of the background normalization is then very important .",
    "overall we find that , while the reach is limited in that there are large ranges of parameters where experiments at the tevatron may see no signal in this channel even if @xmath188 is just beyond the lep2 bound , experiments at run  ii should be able to probe significant parameter ranges not accessible at lep if @xmath15 is small . for @xmath189 ( or larger )",
    "there is very little signal in this channel at run  ii , although some ranges of parameters become accessible with 25  fb@xmath101 of integrated luminosity .",
    "this underscores the importance of other channels for susy detection , particularly when @xmath15 is large .",
    "the standard @xmath190 , the @xmath190 plus tagged @xmath44 , the @xmath178 and @xmath179 ( where @xmath43 is identified via its hadronic decays ) channels are especially important @xcite in this regard .",
    "since we do not know what nature has in store for us , we reiterate the need to develop techniques to efficiently tag @xmath43 leptons via their hadronic decays to ensure that new physics signals ( not necessarily from supersymmetry ) do not evade detection at luminosity upgrades of the tevatron .",
    "the development of tau triggers does not appear to be as essential at this point .    before closing",
    ", we mention that it may be possible to further optimize the cuts once a susy signal has been detected .",
    "for instance , if data indicate that the upper end point of the dilepton mass distribution happens to be well below @xmath125 , it may be possible to significantly reduce the dominant @xmath51 background ( thereby increasing the significance of the signal ) by widening the @xmath42-veto window .",
    "the point , of course , is that once we have a qualitative picture of the signal , further optimization is likely to be possible .    _",

    "<S> within a wide class of models , the lep2 lower limit of 95  gev on the chargino mass implies gluinos are heavier than @xmath0300  gev . in this case </S>",
    "<S> electroweak @xmath1 and @xmath2 production are the dominant susy processes at the tevatron , and the extensively examined isolated trilepton signal from @xmath2 production assumes an even greater importance . </S>",
    "<S> we update our previous calculations of the susy reach of luminosity upgrades of the fermilab tevatron in this channel incorporating ( _ i _ )  decay matrix elements in the computation of the momenta of leptons from chargino and neutralino decays , ( _ ii _ )  the trilepton background from @xmath3 and @xmath4 production which , though neglected in previous analyses , turns out to be the dominant background , and finally , ( _ iii _ ) modified sets of cuts designed to reduce these new backgrounds and increase the range of model parameters for which the signal is observable . </S>",
    "<S> we show our improved projections for the reach for susy of both the fermilab main injector and the proposed tev33 upgrade . </S>",
    "<S> we also present opposite sign same flavor dilepton invariant mass distributions as well as the @xmath5 distributions of leptons in susy trilepton events , and comment upon how the inclusion of decay matrix elements impacts upon the tevatron reach , as well as upon the extraction of neutralino masses . </S>"
