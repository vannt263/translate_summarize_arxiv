    "in particular , the case of reaction in subdiffusive systems  @xcite is rather interesting for its role in living systems , since anomalous subdiffusion has been reported for different biological transport problems such as two - dimensional diffusion in the plasma membrane and three - dimensional diffusion in the nucleus and cytoplasm ( see  @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show that the behavior of tails of the probability distribution of the pure transport problem has the most important role for the front propagation properties , which can be anomalous even in case of standard diffusion . on",
    "the other hand one can have the standard linear front propagation also in presence of subdiffusion .",
    "it is important to stress that , as already noted in  @xcite and clearly stated in  @xcite , the details of the reaction - diffusion rules can be very important for the front propagation features .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we briefly summarize some results about non standard diffusive systems and front propagation in presence of reaction . sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] is devoted to an analysis of front propagation in a simplified model with sub - diffusion . in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we show that , even in a more realistic model , the basic ingredient for the asymptotic behavior of front propagation is given by the shape of the tail of the probability distribution , @xmath0 , of the pure transport problem .",
    "we point out that the shape of the bulk of @xmath0 , which determines the diffusive properties , could be important just for the pre - asymptotic behavior of the front propagation .",
    "[ sec:5 ] is dedicated to the conclusions .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath0 the probability distribution ( or the probability density ) that a walker is in @xmath1 at time @xmath2 . under rather general hypothesis",
    ", @xmath0 satisfies the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the probability density to be in @xmath1 at time @xmath5 under the condition to be in @xmath6 at time @xmath2 .",
    "even if @xmath4 has an explicit dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath2 the process is markovian . when @xmath4 does not depend on @xmath1 and @xmath2 and in absence of fat tails , eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) describes standard diffusion , i.e. at large time @xmath7 and @xmath0 is close to a gaussian .",
    "the simplest case is the standard random walk , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in order to introduce a reaction term in the diffusion equation  ( [ p ] )",
    "we consider  @xcite a time discrete reaction process such as , in absence of diffusion , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the concentration field , and @xmath12 , the reaction map , can be approximated by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the reaction term which , in the simple auto - catalytic case , reads @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the characteristic time associated to the reaction . in any case , we are interested in pulled reactions ( i.e. , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as in the case of auto - catalytic reactions ) for which the detailed shape of @xmath14 is not important .",
    "following  @xcite the concentration evolution satisfies the equation @xmath19 the above equation extends , for general diffusive process  ( [ p ] ) in a discrete time version , the usual reaction - diffusion equation @xmath20 . + for equation  ( [ integ ] ) it is possible to apply the maximum principle  @xcite obtaining @xmath21    in the case of pulled reaction , to which we always refer in this paper , the previous equation becomes ( see  @xcite ) @xmath22 for a standard diffusive process , i.e. when @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the front position @xmath26 can be easily obtained assuming that the concentration @xmath11 , as it is given by eq .",
    "( [ thetap ] ) , is of order 1 .",
    "it turns out : @xmath27 representing the well - known result of a linear propagating front with velocity @xmath28 .    in the case of anomalous diffusion , a simple assumption for the probability distribution that generalizes the gaussian shape for the standard diffusive case , is @xmath29 the value of @xmath30 discriminates between subdiffusion and superdiffusion , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "( [ pnu ] ) , in fact , implies that @xmath33 using eq .",
    "( [ pnu ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) one gets @xmath34 so that , as previously discussed , one can easily obtain the front position @xmath26 that , in this case , behaves as @xmath35",
    "let us stress that , also when ( [ pnu ] ) holds , the value of the exponent @xmath36 depends on the characteristics of the process underlying anomalous diffusion .",
    "an interesting case , suggested by an argument due to fisher  @xcite , is when @xmath37 using expression ( [ beta ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ xf2 ] ) one gets that the front always propagates linearly in time , i.e. @xmath38 although diffusion is anomalous ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "such a linear behavior holds both in the sub - diffusive case ( for example in the random walk on a comb lattice where @xmath40 ) and in the super - diffusive one ( for example in the random shear flow where @xmath41 )  @xcite .    in general , when relations ( [ pnu ] ) or ( [ beta ] ) do not hold",
    ", the front propagation could be non linear in time .",
    "we refer to these cases as `` non standard '' propagation .",
    "we will see that non standard propagation can occurs also in the case of a standard diffusive process when the tail of the @xmath0 show a non standard behavior .",
    "+ as an example we report the work of  @xcite where the diffusion process is given by ( [ p ] ) but the probability density of jumps @xmath42 has fat tails , i.e , @xmath43 with @xmath44 positive .",
    "the central limit theorem ensures that for large times @xmath2 and for @xmath45 @xmath46 where the @xmath47 are independent extractions with probability @xmath42 and @xmath48 is a gaussian variable .",
    "accordingly , the standard diffusion scaling @xmath49 holds ( provided that @xmath50 in order to avoid divergence induced by tails ) . therefore one would expect that the associate propagating front scales linearly with time , but , on the contrary , one finds that its behavior is exponential in time .",
    "in fact , while the bulk of the @xmath0 becomes gaussian when @xmath2 increases , the tails continue to be fat as @xmath51 , although the frontiers between the gaussian bulk and the fat tails shift at the extremes when time increases . using eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) one obtains @xmath52 so that for large times the front increases exponentially fast  @xcite : @xmath53 in conclusion , the shape of the tails and not the scaling of @xmath54 is a crucial ingredient in determining the features of the front propagation .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that , in presence of fat tails of the probability distribution for the pure transport process , standard diffusion are compatible with super - linear behavior for the front propagation .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to confirm that the shape of such tails is the most important element influencing the scaling behavior of the front position .",
    "in particular we are interested in sub - diffusive and ( more importantly ) standard diffusive system when slim tails of the probability distribution induce to a sub - linear behavior of the front propagation . in this respect ,",
    "the present paper is complementary to the result presented at the end of the previous section and in mancinelli et al .",
    "@xcite .    in order to tackle this goal we consider",
    "a very simple random walk model which , according to a single control parameter , can be sub - diffusive or diffusive : a walker , starting from home ( @xmath55 ) , at any discrete time can make a ( unitary length ) step to the right or to the left @xmath56 where    * @xmath57 with equal probability if @xmath58 ; * @xmath59 if @xmath60 .    ) is sub - diffusive when @xmath61 , according to @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and is standard diffusive @xmath64 when @xmath65 . ]     of the process ( [ xx ] ) is shown for @xmath66 and different times . although the value of @xmath67 is close to @xmath68 the truncation only involves distribution tails which carry a minimal total probability .",
    "moreover , truncation shifts to the right in time and asymptotically vanishes .",
    "this can be better appreciated in the inset where the probability @xmath69 of @xmath70 is shown and compared with a gaussian ( dotted black line ) . ]",
    "this process is confined in a box by two reflecting boundaries situated in @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 .    if @xmath61 the process is sub - diffusive according to @xmath74 with @xmath63 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "notice that in this case the distribution of @xmath75 is approximately uniform between -1 and 1 ( for large times ) as the box dimension increases slowly with respect to the relaxation of the process in the box .    on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath76 the process behaves as an ordinary diffusion with @xmath77 so that @xmath78 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] . in this ordinary diffusive region",
    "the effect of the reflecting boundaries is just to kill the tails of the process for @xmath79 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath70 , as time @xmath2 increases , becomes closer to a gaussian , with the truncation which shifts on the extremes and disappears for large times @xmath80 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .     for different values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 is shown . in all cases @xmath83 with @xmath84 . ]",
    "model ( [ xx ] ) is a simplified version of the non markovian random walk introduced in ref.s  @xcite . the stochastic process ( [ xx ] ) is a markovian process so we can use eq.(2 ) to describe reaction - diffusion dynamics .",
    "when a reaction term is involved , it turns out that in all cases the exponent @xmath36 of the propagating front equals the exponent @xmath81 which defines the process , i.e. @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , not only the scaling behavior of the front is anomalous in case of sub - diffusion ( for @xmath85 , but also in case of regular diffusion ( for @xmath86 . in fact , e.g. in the last case , eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) reads : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the heaviside step function representing the truncation of the distribution tails .",

    "[ fig_3 ] where the front position @xmath90 is shown .",

    "for instance the problem of foraging strategies , with the walker ( animal ) changing its attitude when it is at the frontier of unexplored regions  @xcite .    such a process does not present sharp boundaries .",
    "in fact , if @xmath97 is finite , the walker can cross the position @xmath108 but she advances with an increasing difficulty when she is at a larger distance from the origin .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath109 , this model coincides with the model of section iii ( which has boundaries in @xmath108 ) . in the opposite case ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath110 , it is worth noting that the process becomes an `` asymmetrical '' random walk with probabilities @xmath111 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath59 ( in the origin the probability is symmetrical ) . in this case",
