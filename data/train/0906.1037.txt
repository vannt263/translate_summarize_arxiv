    "the activation energies obtained in finite systems are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit , which give theoretical predictions for future experimental studies of the fractional quantum hall states in graphene .",
    "our results show that the gaps ( @xmath132 ) at @xmath1 and @xmath128 effective fillings in the excited ll in bilayer graphene are larger than those in conventional quantum well and single layer graphene .",
    "therefore bilayer graphene is a good candidate for future experimental observation of the fractional quantum hall effects .",
