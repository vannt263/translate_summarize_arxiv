    "<S> can be regulated arbitrarily by the amplitude and frequency of the periodic driving . for the sinusoidal driving </S>",
    "<S> , we give an expression for the total operation time in the high - frequency limit . for the square wave driving , </S>",
    "<S> we derive an exact analytical expression for the evolution operator without any approximations , and show that the amplitude and frequency of driving field depend on its period and total operation time . </S>",
    "<S> this could provide a new direction in regulations of the operation time in topological quantum computation . </S>"
