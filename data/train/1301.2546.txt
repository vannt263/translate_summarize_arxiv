    "molecular simulation is a well - established approach for the analysis of fluid interfaces and their molecular structure .",
    "much work has been dedicated to the interfacial tension.@xcitefor a fluid interface , there are ( at least ) three different aspects in which its size can be varied , each of which may affect the interfacial tension :    * curvature effects , depending on the local characteristic radii of curvature * capillary wave effects , depending on the range of wavelengths permitted by the morphology and size of the interface * confinement effects , which arise due to spatial restrictions imposed on a fluid phase by one or several interfaces or walls    according to the tolman @xcite approach , the interfacial tension of a nanodroplet deviates from that of a planar interface due to its extremely curved shape.@xcite  however , it should be noted that all three phenomena are present when the size of a droplet is varied : smaller droplets have a higher curvature , a smaller range of capillary wavelengths , and a more significant deviation from bulk - like behaviour due to confinement .",
    "in addition to curvature , the other effects might therefore also have a significant influence on the formation of droplets in a supersaturated vapor , where the size of the critical nucleus and the nucleation rate are of major interest.@xcite  a similar case is cavitation , where bubbles emerge in a liquid phase.@xcite     on the employed cutoff radius @xmath2 , for the truncated and shifted lj potential without long - range effects ( ljts ) and for the full lj potential with a long - range correction ( lrc ) according to janeek.@xcite  the simulations were carried out in the canonical ensemble with @xmath3 = 2 048 particles at @xmath4 = 0.7 using a simulation box with an elongation of @xmath5 = 66 in the direction perpendicular to the vapor - liquid interfaces.,width=293 ]    spherically curved interfaces of droplets were simulated for the first time by molecular simulation in the early 1970s.@xcite  nonetheless , while curvature effects are relatively well - studied , there are only astonishingly few investigations related to the other size effects , which are also present in the case of planar interfaces .",
    "several previous works address the influence of small simulation volumes,@xcite  which is usually discussed in terms of capillary wave effects.@xcite  the present study considers the influence of the liquid slab thickness , i.e.  of confinement by two parallel planar vapor - liquid interfaces which are close to each other .",
    "this effect was previously investigated by weng et al .",
    "@xcite who , however , did not find a systematic correlation .",
    "the computation of interfacial properties is always done in a single simulation volume containing both phases , the liquid and the vapor phase , separated by the interface . for the calculation of the bulk properties",
    "there are many other methods , like grand equilibrium,@xcite  @xmath6 plus test particle,@xcite  or the gibbs ensemble method.@xcite  the surface tension can be computed for example via the virial route or the surface free energy.@xcite  the virial route is directly related to the common approach for calculating the pressure in a molecular simulation.@xcite  it is known that the pressure in dependence of the density exhibits a van der waals loop in the two phase region.@xcite     over the temperature for large liquid slabs .",

    "( [ eq : surface]).,width=293 ]    at interfaces , the long range contribution to the interaction potential plays an important role for all thermodynamic properties.@xcite  nonetheless , there are also simulations applying a truncated and shifted potential , which neglects the whole long range contribution.@xcite  when dealing with a homogeneous system , long range corrections are only needed for energy and pressure,@xcite  while in an inhomogeneous configuration , also the dynamics of the systems needs to be appropriately corrected.@xcite     ( top ) and differential pressure @xmath7 ( bottom ) over the @xmath8 coordinate ( i.e.  the direction perpendicular to the interface ) . the temperature is @xmath9 .",

    "[ fig : density_rrho ] , the reduced density @xmath33 is plotted over the slab thickness for different temperatures .",
    "the relative density also decreases upon decreasing the slab thickness and , similar to the surface tension , this effect is approximately proportional to @xmath32 and becomes more significant at high temperatures .     over the slab thickness @xmath1 for different temperatures .",
    "the dashed lines represent the expression @xmath34 , where the temperature - dependent coefficients were adjusted to the simulation results , yielding @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41.,width=293 ]    for a slab thickness @xmath42 , the surface tension agrees with the value for a large liquid slab , within the simulation uncertainty . for a fluid described by the lj potential , e.g.  methane,@xcite",
    "this means that confinement effects are significant for slabs which are thinner than 4.5 nm . at high temperatures ,",
    "the density in the center of the liquid slab deviates more significantly from the bulk value .",
    "the present results suggest that the reduction of the density and the surface tension due to confinement are related effects . in fig .",

    "( [ eq : regression]).,width=293 ]",
    "in the present work , molecular simulation was applied to study the influence of the slab thickness on the interfacial properties for planar vapor - liquid interfaces .",
    "the present results prove that such an effect exists for thin slabs and quantifies it for the lj fluid .",
    "the surface tension decreases with decreasing slab thickness , and so does the density in the middle of the slab .",
    "the differential pressure does not reach zero for liquid slabs smaller than 12 , which proves that under such conditions , a bulk - like region is absent .",
    "the confinement effects for the surface tension and the density were found to scale with @xmath32 in terms of the slab thickness @xmath1 , so that a linear relation between both effects could be obtained .",
    "the present results depart from those obtained by weng et al .",
    "@xcite in a previous study , where no systematic correlation between the slab thickness and the surface tension was found . for a lj system at @xmath4",
    "= 0.818 , weng et al .  detected minor fluctuations around a constant value ( @xmath20 = 0.78 @xmath45 0.02 ) , without a clear tendency , for a range of slab thicknesses between @xmath46 and @xmath47.@xcite  a juxtaposition with the present numerical data , cf .  tab .",
    "[ tab : data_gamma1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : surfacetension_rrho ] , according to which varying the slab thickness to such an extent has a significant influence on @xmath20 , clearly shows that there is a contradiction between present simulation results and the postulate of weng et al .",
    "that `` with film thickness  surface tension values and density profiles show little variation.''@xcite for the simulations of weng et al.,@xcite  however , no long - range cutoff correction was employed at all , and the computations were only carried out over 120 000 time steps , as opposed to a million time steps for the present series of simulations . since systems with an interface relax more slowly than the homogeneous bulk fluid , the extremely short simulation time could consitute a serious limitation , affecting the accuracy of the results obtained by weng et al .",
    "@xcite to a significant extent .",
    "the comparison with results from a recent study of malijevsk and jackson @xcite suggests that the present results on confinement by two parallel planar vapor - liquid interfaces might also carry over qualitatively to confinement by the opposite sides of the single spherical interface that surrounds a small droplet .",
    "therein , malijevsk and jackson come to the conclusion that for liquid drops , the size dependence of the surface tension is best described by two distinct , additive terms : the conventional tolman term , representing curvature , which increases the surface tension ( i.e.  the tolman length is found to be negative ) , as well as `` an additional curvature dependence of the @xmath48 form '' which causes an eventual decrease of the surface tension `` for smaller drops.''@xcite  furthermore , malijevsk and jackson observe that the characteristic droplet radius , below which this negative corrective term becomes dominant , `` increases with increasing @xmath2 '' and conjecture that `` such a crossover occurs when  no ` bulk ' region can be assigned inside the drop . in this case",
    "even particles in the centre of the drop ` feel ' the interface . ''",
    "the present results lend further plausibility to this conjecture of malijevsk and jackson . there could be a relation between their @xmath48 term and the @xmath32 confinement effect from the present study . according to such a hypothesis",
    ", these contributions would both represent the deviation from bulk - like behavior of the liquid phase due to confinement .",
