    "<S> networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons display asynchronous irregular ( ai ) states , where the activities of the two populations are balanced . at the single cell level , it was shown that neurons subject to balanced and noisy synaptic inputs can display enhanced responsiveness . </S>",

    "<S> [ rsfs]a ; see details in appendix ) . a network of 8000 rs and 2000 fs cells generated ai states with the typical higher frequency firing of inhibitory neurons ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in this network , the conductance state of individual cells was consistent with experimental measurements in awake animals ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the network in a physiologically plausible ai state could display a remarkable sensitivity to this external input ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> however , in a network displaying an aberrant conductance state , this response was not present . </S>",
    "<S> the response was also absent in a quiescent state , or in an oscillatory state in the same network ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ enhai]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the ai state , if with correct conductance and @xmath0 fluctuations , displays an enhanced responsiveness to external inputs , and is able to collectively detect inputs of very small amplitude , which normally would have been subthreshold .    </S>",
    "<S> we have done additional simulations to explore how responsiveness depends on conductance state , by considering random sets of parameters around the ai state in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ enhai]a . </S>",
    "<S> this exploration showed that the responsiveness highly depends on the conductance state of the network ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rob ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the response was quantified as the area of the evoked population response ( as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ enhai]b ) , represented against the total conductance , as calculated from distributions ( as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rsfs]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the response is indeed high for physiological conductance states ( gray area in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this result explains the difference of responsiveness between the two networks shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ enhai]b ( top ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is important to keep in mind that the response also depends on the level of fluctuations and the average v@xmath2 level , which can be quantified by considering distributions of the standard deviation of the membrane potential ( @xmath3 ) and of the mean v@xmath2 of the cells ( not shown ) . </S>",

    "<S> the total conductance was calculated as the sum of the average conductance distributions ( as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rsfs]d ) , and thus was normalized to the leak conductance . </S>",
    "<S> the gray area indicates the conductance range corresponding to physiological measurements in awake animals . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon of network - level responsiveness is very similar to the enhanced responsiveness that was found earlier at the single neuron level  @xcite . in single - cell studies , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of synaptic `` noise '' conferred an anhanced sensitivity to the neuron . </S>",
    "<S> it was also shown that having the correct conductance state and fluctuation regime of the cell is important , it sets the response to a realistic level , and enhanced responsiveness was present using the conductances measured experimentally , as well as their level of fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> enhanced responsiveness was also found in noisy networks , either in feedforward networks where all cells display a high - conductance state  @xcite , or in chaotic recurrent networks where the enhanced responsiveness was quantified in terms of information transport  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of these studies was the first to demonstrate that networks in a chaotic state display enhanced responsiveness  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we complement here these previous studies by showing that enhanced responsiveness is present in recurrent networks displayin ai states , which are presumably chaotic  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that this property highly depends on conductance state , and that physiologically plausible conductance state are particularly responsive . </S>",
    "<S> this underlies the importance to work with conductance - based models , as current - based models are unlikely to display the correct responsiveness , and can not be checked against conductance measurements , so are also unconstrained .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , the present results suggest that the conductance state of a network is a fundamental property to understand its responsiveness , which emphasize the importance of conductance measurements _ in vivo_. we suggest that hc states have a universal aspect , in the sense that the conductance and fluctuation level measured _ in vivo _ are the fundamental parameters that neural networks should reproduce , to yield responsiveness properties relevant to neural function .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us emphasize that in the ai state , the network responds instantaneously to an input , and this input can occur at any time , which presents evident useful computational properties . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly interesting property is that , when submitted to successive presentations of the same stimulus , different neurons respond on each trial , showing that it is the whole network that is globally `` aware '' of this stimulus . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose that such network - level responsiveness during ai states implements a low - level form of sensory awareness in networks of neurons . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that this occurs in ai states is consistent with the observation that cerebral cortex is in a `` desynchronized '' state in awake and attentive states ( reviewed in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a recent review concluded that desynchonized cortical activity is so far the best correlate of conscious states  @xcite , but no mechanism was given . </S>",
    "<S> we propose here such a possible mechanism to link these high - level aspects to elementary biophysical properties of neurons .    </S>",
