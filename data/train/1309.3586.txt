    "[ layout ] , the telescope optics consist of three mirrors , referred to as m1 , m2 and m3 .",
    "the first two mirrors , separated by 600 mm , are spheres with radii of curvature 1579 mm and -479 mm , respectively .",
    "m3 is a flat used to fold the beam for instrument volume constraint purposes .",
    "the f - number of this design is f/420.2 , however the exact f - number of the system is likely to vary by @xmath275% due to the extreme sensitivity of the f - number to the distance between m1 and m2 . even though the optics are spheres , the rms wfe is only 7 nm because the f - number is so slow .",
    "furthermore , at the spatial frequencies corresponding to the exoplanet discovery zone , 132@xmath28 , the mirrors only have 1 nm rms wfe .",
    "this surface quality corresponds to a degradation in strehl of only about 1% ( i.e. from 90% to 89% strehl ) .    to determine the optimum diameter of the telescope mirrors we performed a fresnel diffraction analysis .",
    "[ m1diffloss ] shows an example of this analysis on m1 . the throughput loss for the on - axis , perfectly aligned case is 0.2% , and the loss for the off - axis beam with 6 mm misalignment ( worst case scenario ) is 1.0% .",
    "the actual diameter of m1 is likely to be @xmath2635 mm , which will allow for further misalignment on this mirror ( with similar throughput numbers ) to adjust the tip / tilt of the beam .",
    "at the focus of the f/420 beam provided by the prelenslet optics is the lenslet array .",
    "the lenslet array design was optimized by varying three parameters : the incident f - number of the telescope optics , the lenslet f - number and the pitch of the lenslets . choosing these three parameters",
    "constrains the system to discrete rotation angles ( rotation is necessary to avoid overlapping spectra , see fig .",

    "in general , increasing the psflets separation by increasing pitch while holding the lenslet f - number fixed will decrease lenslet crosstalk .",
    "faster f - number lenslets will have a smaller diffraction pattern ( and hence less crosstalk ) , but the spectrograph s optics must also be increasingly fast as the lenslet f - number speeds up .",
    "faster spectrograph optics typically correlate with a more costly design and increased optical wavefront error ( wfe ) .",
    "finally , a slow incident beam decreases the phase variation across the lenslets , which minimizes the psflet translation in the lenslet focal plane .",
    "in other words , we require that the lenslet f - number be much faster than the incident f - number so that the lenslets effectively see collimated light .",
    "this design makes the depth of focus of the telescoping optics is on the order of the lenslet focal length .",
    "this trade study drove us to a lenslet design with a f/420 incident beam and f/8 lenslets with a 250@xmath16 pitch .",
    "these f - numbers are slower than those typical of existing high - constast imaging ifss .",
    "we found that f/8 was the optimum lenslet f - number in the trade space of spectrograph optics cost and performance ( driving us to a slower lenslet f - number ) verses minimizing crosstalk ( which drove the faster f - number ) .",
    "the f/8 spectrograph was slow enough to allow for the use of reflective optics which will decrease the chromaticity and increase the throughput of the system , minimize the size of the collimated pupil , and reduce the complexity of the optical figure in the collimator and camera .",
    "the slower f - number should also make these optics easier to design , build and assemble while still meeting our wavefront error ( wfe ) specifications .",
    "an incident telescope f - number of f/420 was chosen because of concern for diffraction effects from a slower telescope ( which would require larger diameter focusing optics , see fig .",
    "[ m1diffloss ] ) and because the depth of focus ( @xmath29 mm ) of the telescope optics is of order the lenslet s focal length .",
    "this f - number also corresponds approximately to a 1:1 imaging system between the lenslet and detector . minimizing spectrograph magnification ( i.e. slower incident f - numbers ) decreases crosstalk because the psf is magnified less . to achieve nyquist sampling",
    ", we chose the lenslet pitch to be 250@xmath16 which gave a plate scale of @xmath30 where the variables in eq .",

    "this plate scale corresponds to nyquist sampling at @xmath31 .",

    "the rotation angle of the lenslet array is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 = 2 and @xmath34 = 1 are the spaxels along the x and y axis , respectively , that give the rotation angle of the lenslet relative to the unclocked position and where the angle of lenslet clocking is measured relative to the dispersion direction .",
    "integer multiples of lenslets ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) must be chosen to obtain the rotation angle .",

    "[ lensletcoat ] .",
    "the presences of pinholes on the back surface of the lenslet array lead to a stringent phase error requirement which must be carefully calculated and understood .",
    "the phase errors are the subject of the next section ,  [ sec : phase ] .",
    "although the pinholes successfully suppress the crosstalk ( see fig .",
    "[ psfcrosssec ] ) , they can also vignette the beam or completely block the light going through the system if the phase errors on the lenslet are    severe enough .",
    "the lenslet array in a ifs works just like a shack - hartmann wavefront sensor , and thus phase errors cause x  y translations in the plane of psflets and pinholes .",
    "a complete estimate of the phase error due to atmospheric residuals , optical wfe and non - telecentricity is essential to ensure the light is not vignetted by the pinhole array .",
    "this section will consist of two parts .",
    "first we estimate the required phase error tolerance based on the lenslet pinhole diameter . in obtaining this estimate",
    ", we will explore pinhole size and position trades to determine which design allows the maximum phase error while still suppressing the crosstalk to the required levels .",
    "predictable static phase errors ( such as non - telecentricity ) will be taken into account in this section and incorporated into the pinhole design , while other static phase errors that are not predictable prior to building the lenslet array ( such as alignment error ) will be taken into account in the allocation of the phase error budget .",
    "the second part of this section will estimate the total ( non - static ) rms phase error which depends on optical wfe due to all errors prior to the lenslet and residual atmospheric wfe not corrected by the ao systems .",
    "first we explore the lenslet pinhole phase error sensitivity . because of chromatic defocus ,",
    "not all the psflets come to focus in the same plane as the pinholes .",
    "when we model the sensitivity to phase errors , we use fresnel propagation code in matlab that propagates the light from the front surface of the lenslet array to the psflet plane and allows for the psflet to be in a different plane than the pinhole to account for chromatic defocus .",
    "simulated phase errors can be added prior to the propagation .",
    "the phase error tolerance will be directly proportional to the size of the pinhole behind the lenslet array .",
    "therefore we want to make the pinhole as large as possible . the center - to - center spacing ( @xmath50 pixels from eq .",
    "[ eq : widthspec ] ) minus one pixel is the maximum radius the pinhole can be before the diffraction interferes with the adjacent spectra .",
    "thus , we choose a pinhole of radius 4 pixels in the detector plane which corresponds to a 136@xmath16 pinhole on the back surface of the lenslet array ( but is magnified to 144@xmath51 m on the detector ) .",
    "note that the pinhole is undersized to allow for post - lenslet wfes which will broaden the psf .",
    "[ psfcrosssec ] shows a cross section through the spikes of the psf in the focal plane of the lenslet array with and without a pinhole .",
    "the adjacent spectra is 105@xmath51 m away from the peak of the psf .",
    "the goal is to suppress the wings below 10@xmath52 , which is successfully accomplished by the pinholes with margin for optical wfe.fig .",

    "the transmission through the pinhole decreases by a small ( 1.3% ) amount for misalignments of @xmath55 , but then drops to 92.0% with a 1.65@xmath54 of misalignment and continues to drop rapidly with larger misalignments .",
    "based on this analysis the total acceptable phase error allowed on the lenslet array is 1.5@xmath54 of misalignment , which corresponds to a 94.0% transmission through the pinhole ( or 3.7% less than the perfectly aligned pinhole ) .",
    "the maximum allowable phase error of 1.5@xmath54 is allocated to various sources .",
    "the first allocation is to the actual placement of the pinholes on the back side of the lenslet array .",

    "this offset is accounted when depositing the lenslet array pinholes to within the manufacture s ability to place the pinhole in the desired location .",

    "the average spectral resolution across all wavelengths in the high - res mode is r = 73 .",
    "the design of the high resolution prism is driven completely by attempting to make all three ( j- , h- and k - band ) high resolution spectra the same length .",

    ". the low resolution prism design is still being finalized , but will likely use the same materials as the high - res prism .",
    "because the low resolution spectra need only create one 20% bandpass spectrum at a time , the design of the prism was focused on how the light was distributed within the spectra .",
    "the design specification for the low resolution mode required that there be at least one spectral measurement in j - band , three measurements in h - band and two in k - band .",
    "the reason for having an increased number of spectral measurements at the longer wavelengths is because spectral features in the exoplanet atmospheres are expected to be present here ( such as the methane feature in h - band ) .",

    "we listed the sources of phase errors ( which lead to translation of the psflet ) on the lenslet .",
    "this included a estimation of the residual atmospheric phase errors ( post ao correction ) which is expected to be the dominant source of phase errors in charis .",
    "this paper may represent the first instances in which phase errors on the lenslet were quantified and characterized .",
    "we discussed the performance of the spectrograph optics including the motivation for the specified ensquared energy values and their relation to crosstalk .",
    "we also noted that the charis spectrograph optics are reflective which minimizes chromaticity and increases throughput  this is another unique feature in the charis design .",
    "the high resolution prism in charis uses a new glass material ( l - bbh1 ) which allows for relatively even resolution across j- , h- , and k - bands enabling a single high - res prism to provide spectra of equal length in the three bands .",
    "finally , we ended with a calculation of the transmission and noise for the end - to - end system including atmosphere , telescope , both ao systems and , of course , charis .",
    "the numerous innovative design features discussed herein will result in higher contrast and will help minimize the noise in charis .",

    "<S> high - contrast imaging techniques now make possible both imaging and spectroscopy of planets around nearby stars . we present the optical design for the coronagraphic high angular resolution imaging spectrograph ( charis ) , a lenslet - based , cryogenic integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) for imaging exoplanets on the subaru telescope </S>",
    "<S> . the ifs will provide spectral information for 138@xmath0138 spatial elements over a 2.07 arcsec @xmath0 2.07 arcsec field of view ( fov ) . </S>",
    "<S> charis will operate in the near infrared ( @xmath1 ) and will feature two spectral resolution modes of @xmath2 ( low - res mode ) and @xmath3 ( high - res mode ) . taking advantage of the subaru telescope adaptive optics systems and coronagraphs ( ao188 and scexao ) , charis will provide sufficient contrast to obtain spectra of young self - luminous jupiter - mass exoplanets . </S>",
    "<S> charis will undergo cdr in october 2013 and is projected to have first light by the end of 2015 . </S>",
    "<S> we report here on the current optical design of charis and its unique innovations . </S>"
