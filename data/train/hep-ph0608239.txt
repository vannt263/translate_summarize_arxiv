    "the standard model of particle physics continues to meet all experimental tests , and yet studies of the structure of the model suggest that it is incomplete .",
    "one well - known difficulty is that the mass of the higgs boson , an essential participant in the standard description of electroweak interactions , receives loop corrections to its mass ( squared ) that are quadratic in the loop momenta .",
    "the largest correction is due to the top quark loop , with smaller contributions coming from loops of the electroweak gauge bosons and of the higgs boson itself .",
    "these corrections offset a tree - level mass term for the higgs boson . at a high energy scale ,",
    "the loop contributions become large , and require a precise near - cancellation by the tree - level mass term in order to achieve an effective higgs boson mass on the order of @xmath5 gev , as required by fits to precision electroweak parameters  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a near - cancellation is highly suggestive of an as - yet unidentified partial or broken symmetry .",
    "this symmetry , evident at high energy scales , would be the cause of a cancellation which , at low energy scales , appears only as an apparent coincidence .    in supersymmetric models ,",
    "the problem of quadratic higgs mass divergences is resolved by the introduction of an opposite - statistics partner for each particle in the standard model .",
    "recently , extended symmetry groups have been found which can contain the @xmath6 electroweak gauge group of the standard model as well as additional structure that provides for quadratic divergence cancellation between _ same-_statistics particles .",
    "these are known as  little higgs \" models  @xcite .",
    "the little higgs models realize a long - standing conception of the higgs as a pseudo - goldstone boson  @xcite .",
    "the  little higgs mechanism \" embodied in these models provides an alternative to supersymmetry for resolving the higgs mass problem .",
    "the little higgs models remove the need for finely - tuned cancellations to beyond about @xmath7 tev , largely beyond the reach of current electroweak constraints on new strong interactions .",
    "however , little higgs models typically leave an uncancelled logarithmic mass contribution , which requires additional new contributions at some high scale to preserve a small higgs mass .",
    "consequently we need not , and in fact can not , view a little higgs model as complete , but must keep in mind that at sufficiently high energies there will be additional contributions from the unidentified complete theory , the so - called  ultraviolet completion \"  @xcite .",
    "a minimum requirement for any proposed extension to the standard model is that it conform to known experimental constraints . in practice",
    "this means that it must not violate the current experimental limits on the properties of known particles , including fits to the free parameters of the electroweak theory , and the current search limits for new particles . applying this requirement to the little higgs models",
    "is considerably complicated by the incomplete nature of the theories .",
    "we may find that the identified contributions of a certain model violate , say , the known experimental limits on the mass of the @xmath8 gauge boson , and yet not be able to determine whether this violation may be offset by contributions from the ultraviolet completion .",
    "considerable effort has been made to determine the true constraints to little higgs models from precision electroweak measurements , using a variety of approaches  @xcite tev , that only a tightly constrained region of parameter space with @xmath9 is allowed , while @xcite finds that a wide range of parameter space is allowed , all with @xmath10 . ] . in this work",
    ", a complementary effort is made to constrain the littlest higgs model using direct search results .    in section",
    "ii of this paper , the littlest higgs model is briefly described , primarily to introduce notation .",
    "section iii presents the main results of the paper , including a scan for the lightest new particles in various regions of parameter space , the full mass - dependent partial decay widths ( at tree level ) of the most - often lightest particle , the @xmath2 , and the combined results of various constraints on the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath0 .",
    "section iv provides some conclusions .",

    "this model is presented in detail , with feynman rules and some phenomenological results , in  @xcite .",

    "i will sketch the structure of the model , and introduce the notation that will be used .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to address the largest contribution to the quadratic divergence , that of the top quark loop , a new pair of massive top - like fermions @xmath13 , @xmath14 is introduced .",
    "a row vector with @xmath13 is constructed as @xmath15 , where ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) is the third - generation quark weak doublet .",
    "the coupling of @xmath18 to the higgs boson is mediated by the yukawa terms in the lagrangian :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are summed over @xmath21 and @xmath22 are summed over @xmath23 , so as to pick the higgs doublet out of @xmath24 .",
    "the second term sets the overall mass scale of the new fermions to @xmath0 .",
    "after mass diagonalization in this sector , the standard model top and bottom quarks emerge along with new massive top partners , which cancel the leading quadratic divergences .    because the standard model top quark mass is known , the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constrained .",
    "the constraint works out to be : @xmath27 unless otherwise indicated , @xmath25 is set to @xmath28 , with @xmath26 set as required to produce the top mass @xmath29 gev .    the requirement that the yukawa terms be gauge - invariant restricts the @xmath30 and @xmath31  hypercharge \" assignments of the fermions , such that the sum for each fermion equals the standard model hypercharge  @xcite .",
    "the remaining freedom of assignment is limited to one parameter for the quarks , @xmath32 , and one for the leptons , @xmath33 .",
    "this freedom is eliminated if we require that all anomalies are cancelled in the theory , resulting in the fixed values @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for the top quark ,",
    "these assignments are fixed by the yukawa terms above  @xcite , but in general anomaly cancellation is not strictly required since this theory is explicitly not complete , and additional anomaly - cancelling contributions could arise from unidentified higher - energy contributions .",
    "the result is a proliferation of more or less unmotivated assignment choices .",
    "motivation for specific choices can be found in the various high - energy completions of the theory , in which all anomalies should cancel . in this work",
    "the anomaly - cancelling choices will be made in all cases for third - generation fermions , and for all fermions unless noted .",
    "the free parameters of the littlest higgs model and typical values used in this study are summarized in table [ lhparameters ] .",
    "to determine the direct - search exclusion limits for the littlest higgs model , as a function of the free parameters of the theory , it is useful to begin by identifying the lightest new particle , since lighter particles are generally easier to produce and therefore to observe , provided that they do not have suppressed couplings to standard model particles . as has been widely noted in the literature , the @xmath2 is the lightest new particle for most parameter choices .",
    "a detailed scan of the @xmath36 parameter space shows that the @xmath2 is always the lightest particle for @xmath37 . for @xmath38 , there are parameter choices for which the @xmath39 and for which the degenerate @xmath40 are the lightest new particles .",
    "the direct search limits on the littlest higgs model will be found from applicable searches for new massive particles . since all the new particles of the littlest higgs model",
    "have masses proportional to @xmath0 in leading order , i will use @xmath0 as a convenient common measure of the lower exclusion limits on the model .",
    "the mass of the @xmath2 is displayed in figure [ ahmass ] as a function of @xmath41 for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "it scales with @xmath0 , and is strongly dependent on @xmath41 .",
    "the current tevatron run ii search reach for narrow resonances similar to @xmath2 is about @xmath42 gev  @xcite , so current direct search data will be able to rule out much of parameter space at @xmath43 tev and below , but less parameter space above @xmath43 tev .    since the @xmath2 is in most of parameter",
    "space the lightest new particle , only its decays to standard model particles will be considered . for @xmath44 , decays to other new littlest higgs model particles , such as @xmath45 , are possible for some parameter choices and would need to be included in a more detailed study of this portion of parameter space .",
    "the @xmath2 can decay to standard model fermion pairs with partial width : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the appropriate color factor for the fermions , @xmath48 is the @xmath2 mass , @xmath49 is the fermion mass , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the appropriate vector and axial couplings of the @xmath2 to the fermions , as catalogued in  @xcite .    the decay width of a particle affects how and to what extent it is experimentally detectable , since production of particles with very large decay widths may be difficult to distinguish from background processes . in the case of a supposed new particle , it is useful to characterize the decay width as a function of the unknown new particle mass . for the @xmath2 ,",
    "the decays to fermion pairs are to leading order manifestly linear in @xmath2 mass .",
    "the @xmath2 can also decay to standard model @xmath52 bosons with partial width :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the triple boson vertex factor and @xmath55 is the mass of the standard model @xmath52 .    note that the mass of the @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath0 , so linearity in @xmath0 means linearity in @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath56 coupling constant is :    @xmath57    so decays to @xmath58 pairs are suppressed by four powers of @xmath0 in the coupling constant squared , which offset four of the five powers of @xmath0 in the partial width ( from the powers of @xmath48 ) , so the partial width to @xmath52s is also linear in @xmath48 .",
    "pairs was neglected due to an apparent belief that the highly suppressed coupling would make the partial width negligible .",
    "that is in fact not the case , as is shown here : kinematic factors ( the polarization sums ) in the amplitude restore the partial width to linearity in @xmath48 .",
    "that work also has a typographically incorrect expression for their kinematic factor @xmath59 . ]",
    "decays are also possible to a @xmath8 boson and higgs boson :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the momentum of one of the outgoing decay products :    @xmath62    in the large @xmath48 limit ( @xmath63 ) , decays to @xmath64 are also linear in @xmath48 .",
    "the dominant decays are therefore all linear in @xmath48 and so the total width is as well .",
    "note that in the limit of massless decay products , the partial widths to @xmath65 pairs and to @xmath64 are equal , as they must be in accordance with the goldstone boson equivalence theorem .",
    "however , at sufficiently low @xmath2 masses , where the decay product masses are not negligible , the partial widths can be quite different .",
    "there would also be , for sufficient @xmath2 mass , the quartic decays @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "these decays are all suppressed by a four powers of the coupling constants , and so would likely be rare .",
    "they are not considered further here .",
    "the resulting total width - to - mass ratio of the @xmath2 is presented in figure [ widthrat ] .",
    "depending on the value of the mixing angle @xmath41 , the @xmath2 can range from very wide , with a total width in excess of the mass , to extraordinarily narrow .",
    "for example , at @xmath69 , the total width is @xmath70 gev at a mass of @xmath71 gev , but for @xmath72 , the total width is only @xmath73 gev at a mass of @xmath74 gev . in general , the very large widths occur for large ( @xmath75 ) and small ( @xmath76 ) cosines of the @xmath77 mixing angle where , as we have seen , the @xmath2 mass becomes large .",
    "it may be that higher - order terms in the sigma field would significantly modify the width in the large - width regions ; this possibility is not explored here .",
    "for very large widths , the breit - wigner propagator would need a fully momentum - dependent width , but that is not done here since the large @xmath2 masses where this would occur are beyond current search limits in any case .",
    "the region of very narrow width ( @xmath78 ) occurs because in this region , the coupling to fermions , and so the largest contributions to the total width , approach zero , as will be considered in the discussion of branching ratios below .",
    "the essential point is that for almost all of the range of @xmath41 , @xmath79 , so we can find exclusion limits from generic searches for narrow resonances .",
    "the branching ratios of the @xmath2 decay are shown in figure [ ahbranch ] , for four sets of choices of the hypercharge and yukawa parameters . for the @xmath80",
    ", @xmath81 hypercharge assignments , which cancel all standard model anomalies , the decays to dileptons @xmath82 and @xmath83 are dominant for more than half of the range of @xmath41 .",
    "the dilepton decays are in fact large for all values of @xmath41 and all four studied combinations of the parameters @xmath84 except , in three cases , for a narrow region around @xmath85 .",
    "leptophobic \" range of parameters is due to a special cancellation of terms in the vector and axial couplings of the @xmath2 to the leptons  @xcite :    @xmath86    inspection of the couplings to all standard model fermions ( other than top ) shows that they , too , vanish at this special angle , as they must in order to maintain anomaly cancellation . to constrain this region",
    "we can consider decays to top pairs , or to @xmath52 bosons .",
    "couplings to top pairs do not vanish at this same angle because of the presence of an additional coupling term originating in the mixing of the top quark with the new fermion @xmath13 : @xmath87    the most recent dilepton resonance results are from cdf  @xcite , in which non - model specific searches using @xmath88 of integrated luminosity from run ii of the tevatron are presented in terms of the generic @xmath89 gauge boson families of carena , daleo , dobrescu , and tait ( cddt )  @xcite .",
    "this latest experimental result , as it is presented , is somewhat less useful in constraining the littlest higgs model than prior studies , which presented generic cross - section limits .",
    "one reason for this is that the cddt framework defines its gauge boson families so as to achieve full anomaly cancellation , which does not occur for effective theories with incomplete anomaly cancellation , as can be the case here .",
    "for the special case of complete anomaly cancellation , we can map the vector and axial couplings of the @xmath2 to the chiral couplings of cddt by subtracting and adding , and find that the @xmath2 is a member of the cddt family @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "for the couplings to @xmath92 , for example , we find the left - handed coupling to be :    @xmath93    which , for @xmath94 , is @xmath95 so @xmath96    likewise , for the right - handed coupling : @xmath97 the remaining @xmath2 couplings are consistent with this identification .",
    "note that the identification with any cddt family will fail unless we make the anomaly - cancelling choices @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and that the other new neutral gauge boson in the littlest higgs model , the @xmath3 , does not conform to any cddt family , because it is not a @xmath89 gauge boson . in these cases constraints",
    "could be found from the limits on generic @xmath98 and @xmath99 couplings , as also defined by cddt  @xcite .",
    "numerical values of @xmath100 are presented in figure [ gz ] .",
    "the absolute value is shown since there is an inconsequential sign change in the expression for @xmath101 at @xmath85 .",
    "cdf presents results for three discrete values of the coupling : @xmath102 .",
    "it is therefore possible to constrain the littlest higgs model at a discrete set of six values of @xmath41 .",
    "those limits are presented in figure [ lhlimits ] , as a set of six values of @xmath0 , one for each available value of @xmath41 .",
    "these limits range as high as @xmath103 gev . from these six points",
    "we find a suggestion of the limits for the full range of @xmath41 .",
    "a presentation by cdf of limits at a larger and denser set of @xmath101 values would permit a more detailed limit on @xmath0 , for the anomaly - cancelling case .",
    "= 3.0 in    a fuller picture can be formed by using generic search results for resonances in dileptons , as done in a previous study using tevatron run i data and a fixed excluded event rate for all @xmath2 masses  @xcite .",
    "the most recent data set is from cdf  @xcite for @xmath104 of integrated luminosity from run ii of the tevatron .",
    "generic resonance searches for particles of spin @xmath105,@xmath28 , and @xmath106 , with masses from @xmath107 to @xmath42 gev , are presented as @xmath108 confidence limits on @xmath109 .",
    "observed limits for spin @xmath28 particles range from @xmath110 fb to @xmath111 fb .",
    "general limits on the littlest higgs model can be found by calculating the cross section @xmath112 and comparing to the search limits on narrow spin-@xmath28 resonances for various values of @xmath0 , and so various @xmath48 .",
    "the cross - sections themselves for a few values of @xmath0 and other free parameters are presented in figure [ lhllsigma ] .",
    "these cross - sections are calculated at tevatron run ii energy @xmath113 tev , at leading order with a k - factor correction : @xmath114 applied as a function of @xmath115 over the resonance , and using the cteq6l parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "the cross - section is relatively large around @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , so we will find the most stringent limits near these values .",
    "the cross - section becomes vanishingly small for large and small @xmath41 because the @xmath2 mass becomes too large for significant production at tevatron energies . around @xmath85 , the cross - section vanishes due to decoupling from leptons and quarks .",
    "the results of comparing the computed cross - sections to the cdf search limits are presented in figure [ lhlimits ] .",
    "the overall symmetry - breaking scale @xmath0 is found to be excluded up to as much as @xmath1 tev , in the anomaly - cancelling case , for some values of @xmath41 .",
    "for other values of @xmath41 , the model is not constrained , due to either decoupling or to a large @xmath2 mass .",
    "the calculated exclusion curves are somewhat below the exclusion points provided by cdf s cddt - specific analysis , as would be expected since the calculated curves are based on less than half of the integrated luminosity used to generate the cddt - specific points .",
    "this relationship provides a cross - check on the independent monte carlo simulations of the @xmath2 cross section described here with that done by cdf .",
    "it is not possible to seek to constrain the littlest higgs model much further in the high mass regions of parameter space with tevatron data .    to attempt to constrain the littlest higgs model in the decoupling range around @xmath85 ,",
    "we can look to the current limits on resonances in top pair production by 0 and cdf  @xcite .",
    "the 0 results , for @xmath118 of integrated luminosity of run ii data , are the most useful for this purpose since generic narrow resonance search limits are presented .",
    "the 0 study assumes a neutral boson width @xmath119 , with @xmath108 confidence limit exclusions ranging from @xmath120 pb at a mass of @xmath121 gev to a minimum of @xmath122 pb at @xmath123 gev , and then increasing to @xmath124 pb at @xmath125 gev .",
    "these limits are considerably larger than the equivalent results for leptons , so we can not expect as strong a constraint overall .",
    "the comparable cross section @xmath126 is calculated as previously for the cross - section to leptons , and is presented in figure [ lhttsigma ] . for the anomaly - cancelling case ,",
    "the calculated cross - section is at most @xmath127 pb , so unfortunately the current experimental limits on resonances in top pair production do not quite provide a constraint . for other choices of the free parameters the top pair resonance limits do provide a constraint for a limited range of @xmath41 .",
    "the remaining hope for constraining the decoupling range from @xmath2 decays falls to the @xmath128 decay mode .",
    "no experimental results on resonances in @xmath52 pair production are available , so we must turn to the total @xmath129 production cross section . the most current result in provided by cdf  @xcite , with an observed cross - section of @xmath130",
    "since the entire cross - section of @xmath2 production at the tevatron is at most @xmath131pb  @xcite , the current limits on @xmath52 pair production are in fact not able to provide a constraint for the littlest higgs model .",
    "having exhausted the likely signals for the @xmath2 , we turn to one of the next - lightest particles , the @xmath3 .",
    "cdf has presented a set of model - specific search limits for the littlest higgs @xmath3 for a set of values of @xmath132  @xcite .",
    "these limits can be converted to limits on the scale @xmath0 , and are displayed in figure [ lhlimits ] .",
    "the @xmath3 results provide an exclusion limit for all values of @xmath41 , filling in the @xmath2 decoupling and high mass regions , although an a much lower exclusion limit .",
    "mass has been used in these cdf limits , they may require reconsideration .",
    "my own studies of the effect of correcting the @xmath3 mass expression suggest that any changes of limits due to this specific correction are likely to be small . ]",
    "in this work i have made a fairly thorough study of the direct limits on the littlest higgs model provided by current searches for new particles , for a range of free parameters , although primarily focused on the anomaly - cancelling case .",
    "recent experimental results permit some constraint in all cases . for a limited range of parameters ,",
    "lower limits on the symmetry - breaking scale can range as high as @xmath133 tev .",
    "the possibility of detection of new particles , and the best means to do so , depends critically on the width of the associated resonance .",
    "wide resonances can be difficult to detect , and so determining the width behavior is important .",
    "the survey of dominant standard model decays of the @xmath2 presented here , with all final masses included , has found that all dominant contributions have partial widths proportional to the @xmath2 mass .",
    "large widths do occur for large ( @xmath134 ) and small ( @xmath76 ) cosines of the @xmath135 mixing angle @xmath41 , and in these regions contributions from non - standard model decays , and higher - order contributions from the @xmath24 field may become important .    as can be seen in figures [ lhlimits ] and [ lhllsigma ] , a low - mass @xmath2 neutral gauge boson can be present and yet undetectable in dilepton studies for a significant range of parameter space , due to decoupling from standard model leptons .",
    "the @xmath2 provides a striking counterexample to broad claims that a new neutral gauge boson ( sometimes generically referred to as a @xmath4 ) is ruled out to a high mass scale .",
    "some observations can be made on recent presentations of experimental results .",
    "searches for individual model - specific new particles are very useful where applicable . however , in a model such as the littlest higgs , with a number of free parameters , carefully described searches for generic narrow resonances , as is done in  @xcite , are also useful .",
    "classifications of new particles such as the cddt framework can play a useful role , too , although this study provides examples of the limitations of such a system , since it is not meant to comprehensively covers the full range of possible new neutral gauge bosons . in the littlest higgs model , the @xmath2 boson in the non - anomaly cancelling case , and the @xmath3 boson , can not be placed in the cddt framework .",
    "limits can be found from constraints on the generic couplings @xmath98 and @xmath99 in all these cases , however .    in this study",
    "most of the meaningful constraints were obtained from dilepton resonance studies .",
    "as the tevatron integrated luminosity builds over the next few years , we can look forward to dilepton results providing increasingly strong constraints or , in a more exciting possibility , beginning to characterize an actual high mass resonance .",
    "top quark resonances do not yet provide a constraint in most cases , but , for the anomaly - cancelling case , the current search limits are less than two times greater than the maximum calculated cross - section .",
    "it appears that at higher integrated luminosity , the search for resonances in top pair production at the tevatron may well be able to provide a constraint in this case , so further studies in this area would be helpful .",
    "if feasible , searches for resonances in @xmath52 pair production would also be quite useful .",
