    "avalanche phenomena are ubiquitous in nature  @xcite . when systems are driven by external forces , their responses are often in the form of intermittent bursts of activities or avalanches .",
    "one well - studied example is the barkhausen noise in magnetic system which corresponds to avalanches of domain movements .",
    "as avalanche behaviors often extend over a huge range of sizes , it has been suggested that avalanche phenomena can be classified into universality classes that are independent of the microscopic details .",
    "a canonical example is the random field ising model ( rfim ) which describes a system of interacting ising spins subject to site - dependent random fields  @xcite .",
    "when this ising system is driven by a magnetic field , it responds in the form of sporadic large - scale spin reconfigurations .",
    "these spin avalanches depend strongly on the level of disorder : while the magnetization dynamics is controlled by large system - spanning events at low disorder , small avalanche clusters dominate the magnetic behavior when disorder is increased .",
    "remarkably , the system exhibits a power - law distribution of avalanche sizes at a critical disorder .",
    "this nonequilibrium criticality induced by quenched disorder is characterized by a unique set of critical exponents as in equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the rfim has since been applied to a number of other systems beyond spins .",
    "conventional wisdom also suggests that the avalanche behaviors are unaffected by thermal fluctuations and are governed by a deterministic dynamics that depends on the static , quenched disorder in the system  @xcite . in this",
    "regard , avalanche is an intrinsic many - body phenomenon in which spin - spin interactions play an indispensable role . in many systems ,",
    "thermal effects are indeed negligible as the energy barriers of spin - flips are often too large for thermal activation to be effective . on the other hand , recent experimental and theoretical studies on magnetic avalanches in molecular magnets",
    "have shown that thermal activation is the dominant factor  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the process known as the magnetic deflagration , the spin dynamics is dominated by single - site spin tunneling assisted by thermal activation .",
    "consequently the avalanche behavior is mostly controlled by the diffusion and dissipation of thermal energy .",
    "fundamentally , magnetic deflagration can be understood in the framework of reaction - diffusion process  @xcite which also describes avalanche phenomena , ranging from phase transition dynamics to pattern formation and propagation of epidemic  waves .",
    "a key component of thermal activated avalanches is the self - sustainability of excess thermal energies that can be used to overcome the energy barriers .",
    "when a system is trapped in a meta - stable state , a small perturbation or a quick variation of the external conditions can induce relaxation of a portion of the system through thermal activated tunneling .",
    "the energy released from this initial relaxation can be reabsorbed by the rest of the system and used to overcome the barrier again .",
    "an avalanche is then ignited when the relaxation process becomes self - sustained . in this scenario",
    ", the rate of energy dissipation naturally plays an important factor as thermal activation becomes negligible if a significant amount of the released energy is removed from the system .",
    "thermal coupling has also been shown to affect the magnetization dynamics of an important class of materials known to exhibit a colossal magentoresistence ( cmr ) , including perovskite manganites and cobaltites  @xcite .",
    "temperature - dependent ultrasharp magnetization steps have been observed in several doped pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 manganites .",
    "moreover , magnetic deflagration induced by surface acoustic waves has been reported in la - based manganites  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have also observed unusual sweep - rate dependence of the avalanche behavior in cmr materials  @xcite . these observations all point to the important role of thermal activations in the avalanche dynamics of these perovskite oxides .",
    "motivated by these experiments , the goal of this paper is to present a theoretical investigation of thermal activated collective behaviors in cmr - related compounds .",
    "a crucial realization in the study of cmr materials is the key role of heterogeneity in understanding the cmr phenomena  @xcite .",
    "for example , doped cobaltites such as la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath1 have been shown to exhibit a particularly clear form of this inhomogeneity by electron microscopy  @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite .",
    "relevant to our study here is the small doping regime , where the ground state can be viewed as consisting of nano - scale ferromagnetic metallic clusters embedded in a non - magnetic insulating matrix .",
    "such phase - separated state thus leads to a natural formation of a granular ferromagnet , analogous to the artificial granular systems that exhibits a giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) behavior  @xcite .",
    "these gmr meta - materials are composed of ferromagentic clusters deposited in a non - magnetic metallic or insulating matrix .",
    "indeed , lightly doped perovskite cobaltites exhibit a hysteretic magnetoresistance behavior with temperature and field dependence similar to the artificial gmr materials  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we perform microscopic dynamical simulations to investigate the intrinsic effects of thermal activation in the avalanche dynamics of granular ferromagnets .",
    "the model of magnetic clusters used in this work is specifically designed such that inter - granular cooperative phenomena are absent in the zero - temperature athermal dynamics .",
    "we develop a numerical scheme based on a microscopic implementation of the reaction - diffusion process modified for the granular systems .",
    "the large - scale simulations on lattice of @xmath4 sites clearly demonstrate thermal activated collective phenomena in the magnetization dynamics of such materials .",
    "in addition , we observe an intriguing non - monotonic dependence of the avalanche behaviors on the dissipation coefficient , indicating the existence of emergent criticality controlled by the rate of energy dissipations in granular ferromagnets .",
    "a continuum percolation model is then developed to understand the numerical results .",
    "in particular , the emergent out - of - equilibrium critical avalanche corresponds to the percolation transition in this picture .",

    "an ising variable @xmath19 is used to denote the spin state of a lattice site that belongs to a magnetic cluster .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for several systems exhibiting easy - axis single - ion anisotropy .",
    "although more realistic models such as heisenberg spins are possible , the ising spin approximation allows us to simulate large - scale lattices while capturing the essential physics .",
    "the most important magnetic property of the clusters is the coercive or threshold field @xmath20 .",
    "it represents a measure of the external field that is required to demagnetize a fully polarized cluster .",
    "while intrinsic single - ion anisotropy is the common source of coercivity , spin - spin interactions also contribute to the coercive field . spins in magnetic clusters interact with each other through several mechanisms . first , there is short - range exchange interactions between neighboring spins . for metallic magnetic clusters ,",

    "importantly , significant variation of the coercive field often results from long - range spin - spin interactions , even in the absence of quenched disorder .",
    "for example , coercivity due to magnetostatic shape anisotropy depends on the geometry of the nano - cluster .     ]",
    "metallic magnetic clusters in which electron interact with spins through the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism also exhibit a coercive field that depends on the cluster geometry . to demonstrate this property",
    ", we simulate the zero temperature magnetization curve of a randomly generated cluster based on the de mechanism .",

    "the effective hopping constant @xmath24 depends on the relative orientation of spins at the neighboring sites and vanishes when the two spins are antiparallel to each other .",

    "interesting , the distribution is slightly asymmetric , indicating a non - gaussian nature of the process .",
    "the above analysis shows that the coercive field of nanoscale clusters in granular magnets depends in general on the size and shape of the cluster . for simplicity , we assume in our simulations that each magnetic cluster is characterized by a single coercive field @xmath20 .",

    "we also assume that there is an intrinsic disorder in the cluster coercive fields , described by a gaussian distribution with a mean @xmath32 and a variance @xmath33 .",
    "again , the microscopic origin of the distribution varies , but most likely involves some long - range interactions .",
    "we expect the general conclusion of our analysis does not depend on details of the coercivity distribution .",
    "since our primary interest in this study is to investigate the intrinsic collective behaviors induced by thermal wave propagation , we will employ the simplest model for the ising spin dynamics , namely , magnetic behavior of a ising spin is solely characterized by the coercive field @xmath20 of the cluster to which it belongs .",
    "specifically , this means that at zero temperature an ising spin will be flipped by an opposite external field only when @xmath34 .",
    "most of the magnetic avalanches , such as barkhausen and crackling noises , are intrinsically non - equilibrium processes , and are often described by athermal and pure relaxational dynamics . within this framework , spin inversion takes place whenever the energy of the system can be decreased . the excess energy released during the inversion process",
    "is assumed to be quickly transferred out of the magnetic subsystem .",
    "the athermal dynamics is often valid at low temperatures and especially when the energy barrier of spin inversion is large enough such that thermal activation can be ignored .",
    "indeed , this approach has been successfully applied to a wide range of magnetic systems .",
    "however , for systems with small or moderate dissipation , the released energy from spin flip can significantly heat up the lattice locally . when this excess energy spreads over the lattice , further spin inversions might be thermally activated due to the elevated local temperatures .",
    "such scenarios have been discussed recently in the context of magnetic deflagration , in which the spin avalanches are modeled by the highly nonlinear reaction - diffusion process .",

    "it is worth noting that despite the seemingly similarity , the ising dynamics here is not the metropolis update ; once the spin is in the ground state , thermal fluctuations are ignored due to the relatively large energy barrier .",

    "as the density of spheres increases , some of the clusters start to span the whole system , signaling the percolation transition .    , while the red circles represent magnetic clusters yet to be inverted with a larger coercive field @xmath115 .",
    "the inverted clusters act as heat sources .",
    "the diffusion of released thermal energy is characterized by a length scale @xmath104 .",
    "the average distance between inverted clusters is @xmath116 , which is a function of @xmath70 .",
    "[ fig : percolation ] ]    in our case , the percolating spheres can be thought of as the spherical region which centers at the inverted cluster and has a radius of thermal diffusion length @xmath104 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : percolation ] .",
    "since the elevated temperature within the sphere can induce further inversions of clusters with larger coercive fields , a system - size percolating super - cluster ( cluster of magnetic clusters in our case ) corresponds to a magnetic avalanche in which an extensive number of clusters are flipped through thermal tunneling . whether a system - size super - cluster can be formed thus depends on the thermal diffusion length @xmath104 as well as the density of the seed clusters .    for an avalanche taking place at @xmath117 , the density of seed clusters @xmath118 whose",
    "coercive field @xmath119 follows a normal distribution .",
    "this introduces a new length scale @xmath120^{1/3 } } = \\xi_0 \\,\\exp\\left[\\frac{(h^ * - \\overline{h}_c)^2}{6 \\sigma_h^2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is basically the average distance between seed clusters . here",
    "@xmath121 is related to the average density of all magnetic clusters .",
    "the percolation threshold in the case of spheres corresponds to a critical ratio @xmath122  @xcite .",
    "the radius @xmath104 as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ell_kp ] ) only depends on the thermal conductivity and the duration of avalanches which is not affected much by dissipation . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed above , a larger dissipation gives rise to a higher trigger field @xmath70 , which in turn results in a higher density of seed clusters and shorter mean distance @xmath116 .",
    "consequently , as dissipation rate is increased , the system will undergo a percolation transition when the mean distance between seed clusters reaches the critical value @xmath123 determined by the special @xmath124 , signaling a magnetic avalanche transition .    for percolating systems , a correlation length can be defined as the characteristic linear size of clusters .",
    "similar to equilibrium phase transitions controlled by temperature , this correlation length diverges at the percolation transition  @xcite .",
    "the absence of a characteristic length scale at the critical point @xmath125 also implies a power - law distribution of super - cluster sizes , which is indeed observed in our numerical simulations ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_cls ] . for small dissipation , the distribution @xmath126 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_cls](a ) exhibits a power - law dependence followed by a spike at largest @xmath68 , resembling the distribution in the super - critical regime of the rfim  @xcite . in conventional supercritical avalanches ,",
    "the spike occurs at the same largest value bounded by the system size . on the other hand ,",
    "the spike shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_cls](a ) shifts toward smaller values of @xmath68 while its peak also diminishes as @xmath71 increases . at the critical value @xmath127",
    ", the distribution shows a power - law dependence all the way to the largest sizes . above the critical @xmath125",
    ", the largest avalanches are cut off by a characteristic size that becomes progressively smaller with increasing dissipation ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_cls](b ) .",
    "the distribution in this regime is again similar to the sub - critical phase of the rfim  @xcite .    in percolation models ,",
    "the power - law distribution of cluster size at the critical point is characterized the so - called fisher s exponent @xmath128 : @xmath129 our simulations find a critical distribution @xmath130 , as shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_cls](b ) , indicating an exponent @xmath131 .",
    "this value is consistent with the fisher exponent obtained from both continuum and lattice percolation transitions in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this agreement further corroborates the continuum percolation picture for the thermal activated avalanches .",
    "it is worth noting that unlike the disorder - induced criticality in random - field ising model  @xcite , the appearance of a critical distribution in our system is controlled by the rate of energy dissipation .     ]",
    "to summarize , we have conducted large - scale simulations of avalanche dynamics in granular ferromagnets , emphasizing the role of thermal activated inter - granular cooperative behaviors .",
    "we have implemented a microscopic simulation scheme based on the reaction - diffusion dynamics . in this framework",
    ", the reaction corresponds to local spin flipping , from which the released magnetic energy can diffuse to other lattice sites and trigger further spin inversions through thermal activation .",
    "our simulations have shown that magnetization jumps in granular materials correspond to simultaneous inversions of a huge number of magnetic clusters triggered by such a self - sustained thermal activated relaxation .",
    "it is worth noting that magnetic interactions among clusters such as the long - range dipolar force are not included in our modeling of the granular system , the inter - cluster collective behaviors are completely of thermal origin .",
    "the matrix serves as a medium that transmits the thermal energy between clusters .",
    "we have also systematically studied the effects of dissipation on the avalanche dynamics and uncovered an intriguing criticality controlled by the rate of energy dissipation .",
    "the nature of this nonequilibrium critical behavior can be understood within the framework of continuum percolation theory .",
    "essentially , regions with elevated temperatures around the seed clusters overlap with each other and form a percolating network .",
    "the emergent criticality thus corresponds to the percolation transition of these high - temperature regions .",
    "our work was motivated by recent experiments showing unusual sweep - rate dependence of magnetic avalanches in perovskite manganites and cobaltites , especially a non - monotonic dependence of the avalanche dynamics on the sweep rate in lasrcoo@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "both materials are known to exhibit the novel cmr effect .",
    "the phase - separated regime of these compounds , which is crucial to their observed novel properties , can be viewed as granular systems consisting of nano - scale metallic ferromagnets embedded in a non - magnetic matrix .",
    "our analysis can also be applied to granaular gmr meta - materials . since",
    "ferromagnetism in clusters of cmr - related compounds arises from the double - exchange ( de ) effect , we have studied the relaxational magnetization dynamics of such de clusters .",
    "it is worth noting that magnetic avalanches in large double - exchange clusters is by itself an interesting and important topic . in particular , for metallic granular magnets in the vicinity of or above the percolation threshold , such as highly doped cobaltites , the magnetic clusters merge to form extended regions coexisting with the non - metallic regions .",
    "we expect interesting physics to result from the interplay between thermal activation and double - exchange effects .",
