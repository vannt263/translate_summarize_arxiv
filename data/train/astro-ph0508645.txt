    "we have used the fibre large array multi - element spectrograph ( flames ) at the very large telescope ( vlt ) to observe massive stars in 7 fields in the galaxy and magellanic clouds .",
    "our target fields were centered on stellar clusters and were selected to sample a range of metallicity ( @xmath0 ) and age . in practice",
    "this means observing fields in the three most readily accessible , yet differing environments , i.e. the milky way and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc respectively ) , as summarized in table [ fields ] .",

    "notionally blue targets were selected from pre - imaging and the flames - giraffe combination was used to observe a total of 750 stars at high - resolution ( @xmath220,000 ) , at six wavelength settings .",
    "these observations form an unprecendented high - quality spectroscopic survey of ob - type stars , with coverage in the blue optical region from 3850 - 4750   , and from 6400 - 6650   , to include the h@xmath3 balmer line .",
    "the primary motivations and observational details of the survey have been presented by evans et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , together with an overview of the galactic data .",
    "a number of parallel studies are now underway using both the galactic and magellanic cloud data to address issues such as :    * to determine the vsin@xmath4 distributions of the observed stars , is there evidence for a dependence with @xmath0 ?",
    "maeder et al .",
    "1999 ; keller 2004 ) . * to obtain physical parameters ( including cno abundances ) for a large , homogenous sample of ob stars .",
    "these will then be coupled with the vsin@xmath4 results to enable comparisons with evolutionary models that attempt to include the effects of rotation e.g. maeder & meynet ( 2000 , 2001 ) . * to explore the @xmath0-dependence of stellar wind mass - loss rates in o - type stars ( cf .",
    "vink et al .",
    "2001 ; see de koter et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "here we focus on the two younger fields in the magellanic clouds , n11 and ngc346 .",
    "these are the richest in the survey in terms of the numbers of o - type stars , and contain a number of interesting objects .",
    "the distribution of spectral types in these two fields is given in table [ types ] .",

    "prior to our survey the best source of spectroscopic information in this region was the study by parker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which found an apparently younger population in lh10 , suggesting that star - formation in that association was triggered by the evolution of the most massive stars in lh9 . owing to observational constraints ( such as crowding )",
    "we have not observed all of the stars in the parker et al .",
    "study , but we have also explored the spectral content in other nearby regions .",
    "three o3-type stars were reported in lh10 by parker et al .",
    ", all of which were considered by walborn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in their extension of the mk classification scheme to include a new o2 subtype ( with one star from parker et al . reclassified as an o2 giant ) . in principle",
    "the hottest ` normal ' stars , there are still only @xmath610 o2-type stars known . here",
    "we report the discovery of a new star classified as o2.5 iii(f@xmath7 ) .",
    "the spectrum ( shown in figure  [ o2star ] ) lies between the standards published by walborn et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 ) and so an intermediate o2.5 subtype is employed .",
    "interestingly the star is not in lh10 , nor in any of the other denser gas regions in the field , and is @xmath64.5@xmath8 to the north of lh10 .",
    "the pre - flames imaging reveals an apparent ionization front in the nearby gas ; moving beyond the central region of lh9 and lh10 , there is still clearly a lot to learn about the star - formation process in this region .    ]      of the 62 o - type stars observed in these two fields , half were unknown prior to this survey ; these data form the core of the analysis by mokiem et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , which employs an automated approach to the problem of analysing such a large sample with contemporary model atmosphere codes ( see mokiem et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the flames survey has also yielded a large number of early b - type spectra , spanning a range of luminosity classes .",
    "our final aim is the consistent analysis of the whole sample ; as a first step toward this , 15 of the narrow - lined ( i.e. low vsin@xmath4 ) stars in ngc346 , and 21 in n11 , have been analysed by hunter et al .",
    "( in preparation ) using the tlusty model atmosphere code ( hubeny & lanz , 1995 ) .",
    "the observations in ngc346 have revealed a number of be - type stars with ( permitted ) emission lines from fe   in their spectra .",
    "the morphology of the h@xmath3 and fe   profiles suggests that we are sampling a number of different projection angles ; some display single - peaked emission , whereas others show twin - peaked emission , commonly interpreted as viewing a circumstellar disk edge - on .",
    "figure  [ bestar ] shows the blue - region spectrum of ngc346 - 023 , with some of the stronger fe   emission lines marked .",
    "this star is only 2.8@xmath8 from the centre of the cluster and appears to be a genuine member ; in a young field such as ngc346 one could speculate that these stars might be somewhat different to classical be stars , more often associated with later products of stellar evolution .    ]    with regard to the relative numbers of be - type stars in table  [ types ] , one should not necessarily conclude that these provide further evidence for a @xmath0-dependence of the be - type phenomenon ( cf .",
    "maeder et al . , 1999 ) ; the selection effects for the be - stars are not well defined at the current time and we are looking further into this aspect of the survey .",
    "due to the significant scale of the flames survey ( in excess of 100 h vlt time ) , all of the observations were undertaken in service mode .",
    "in addition to the separate observations at different wavelengths , each wavelength setting in the lmc / smc fields was observed at least 6 times ( to yield a greater signal - to - noise ratio ) .",
    "we are therefore very sensitive to detection of binaries . indeed , the sampling is relatively good in the sense that we have observations at both small and large time - intervals ( as shown in figure [ times ] ) , with the observations in n11 spanning a total of 57 days and those in ngc 346 covering 84 days .    to date ,",
    "single and double - lined binaries have been found from relatively simple methods , i.e. from visual inspection when classifying the spectra , or from consideration of manual measurements of the stellar radial velocities from the principal hydrogen , helium and silicon absorption lines .",
    "more sophisticated methods are now being used to cross - correlate the individual spectra for each star , which will likely reveal further binaries ( although not expected to be that significant an increase on the current number ) .",
    "the flames data are adequate to derive the periods of some of the newly discovered systems , the more interesting of which will be the subject of a future study . using the numbers in table",
    "[ bins ] , the binary fractions in the observed samples are 37@xmath9 ( n11 ) and 26@xmath9 ( ngc346 ) .",
    "these data place firm @xmath10 limits on the binary fraction .",
    "the fraction will likely increase slightly following use of the cross - correlation methods , and naturally some binaries may remain undetected as a consequence of the time sampling of our observations .",

    "we have given an overview of the spectral content of our flames fields in n11 and ngc346 .",
