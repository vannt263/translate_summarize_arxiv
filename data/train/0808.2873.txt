    "electromagnetic ( em ) wave transmission through apertures in perfect metal screens has been the subject of multiple studies . for a long time , up to the middle of xx century , theoretical treatments of diffraction by either opaque or metal bodies based on the kirchhoff approach .",
    "this method consists in setting the fields on the body equal to their incident values .",
    "bethe was the first to consider the diffraction by a small circular aperture of radius @xmath0 in an infinitesimally thin perfectly conducting screen , providing rigorous analysis of the maxwell s equations with the exact boundary conditions in 1944.@xcite he found analytically the pre - factor appearing in the well - known rayleigh scattering dependency @xmath1 for the scattering cross - section of small objects in the long - wavelength limit ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "later on , bowkamp improved bethe s result , providing additional terms in a series expansion of the transmission over @xmath3 .",
    "since then , this kind of diffraction problem has become a classical chapter in many monographs on electromagnetism , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "the interest in em transmission through apertures has been renewed thanks to the discovery in 1998 of the enhanced optical transmission through an array of small holes.@xcite a great deal of research has been devoted to the transmission through periodical arrays of the holes . nevertheless , the analysis of the diffraction by a single hole in a film of finite thickness is still incomplete , as results found in the literature are only for fixed geometrical parameters .",
    "for example , refs .",
    "provide computed transmission spectra through a circular hole in a film of a finite thickness in a perfect electric conductor ( pec ) slab .",
    "the case of a single circular hole in a real metal has been considered in refs .  .",
    "however , it is problematic to extrapolate these results to other parameters and other hole shapes .",
    "an attempt to represent the solution in an analytical form was undertaken in ref .  .",
    "these authors derived the normalized cross section for a circular aperture ( of radius up to half of the wavelength in pec ) assuming that the magnetic current is uniform within the aperture .",
    "nevertheless , this model shows poor quantitative agreement with both the bethe - bouwkamp results and the strict numerical calculations of roberts.@xcite moreover , it is limited to a screen with zero thickness .",
    "in this paper we study the optical transmission through single holes in pec",
    ". we present new analytical results , valid for a wide range of geometrical parameters , and provide a link between the modal expansion method and the one based on multipoles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the modal expansion technique used for studying the transmission through the hole in a perfect electric conductor film of arbitrary thickness . in section iii",
    "we provide analytical expressions for the transmission through holes of both rectangular and circular shapes in extreme subwavelength limit .",
    "we test our approach by applying it to the most unfavorable conditions for the method used ( when the film thickness is zero ) , and obtain an excellent agrement with known results . in section",
    "iv the square hole of moderate size is treated , when the wavelength is still larger than the hole cutoff ( therefore , the resonances found close to cutoff@xcite will not be discussed there , as have already been addressed before@xcite ) .",
    "finally , in section v , we make the link between the induced multipoles and the waveguide modes inside the hole .",
    "we discuss the importance of the fundamental waveguide mode both for the formation of the induced dipole moments on both faces of the hole and for the coupling between these moments . in appendix we explain the simplifications of green s tensor for the small hole limit .",
    "+    in this section we briefly outline the modal expansion formalism for the em field.@xcite consider an em wave incident onto a pec film of finite thickness @xmath4 containing a hole , see fig.[geom ] .",
    "we first assume that both the bounding media and the medium inside the aperture is vacuum , but later on we generalize the results to arbitrary values of the optical indices of the semi - infinite media .    for the representation of the em field in - plane components we use dirac s notations as follows .",
    "the projection of a given dirac s vector onto the position vector @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , simply yields the value of dirac s vector in the position @xmath7 coordinate dependent field in the coordinate space , for example : @xmath8 the projection of a vector onto another one is given by the scalar product @xmath9 where `` @xmath10 '' means complex conjunction .",
    "let us write in dirac s notations the tangential components of the fields in the lower and upper half - spaces , expanding them over the continuum of plane waves ( see the geometry in fig .",
    "[ geom ] ) : @xmath11 here @xmath12 represents both the in - plane wavevector component @xmath13 and the polarization , @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the coordinate representation of the modes in the vacuum half - spaces reads @xmath16 the plane wave propagation constant is @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the summation operator in eq .   includes both the integration over the @xmath19 continuum spectrum and the summation over the polarizations : @xmath20 . inside the hole",
    ", we expand the tangential components of the field over the modes @xmath21 of the infinite waveguide @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the amplitudes of the waveguide modes propagating ( or decaying ) forwardly and backwardly with respect to @xmath25-axis direction ; @xmath26 represents the propagation constant of a waveguide mode with the label @xmath27 .",
    "this label contains both the polarization of the waveguide mode and a `` spatial '' index related to the number of nodes of the field inside the hole .    by matching the em fields at the interfaces , and using the orthogonality of the modes , we arrive at a set of linear equations for the expansion coefficients @xmath28 the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 so that the system of eqs .   connects the electric field modal amplitudes on the incoming interface , @xmath32 , and on the outgoing one , @xmath33 .",
    "the term @xmath34 describes the coupling between the input and output sides of the holes , and @xmath35 arises from the reflection of the waveguide mode at the openings : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the admittance for the te waveguide mode , and @xmath38 is that for the tm one .",
    "the coupling matrix elements of the system of eqs .   are related to the in - plane components of the em green function dyadic @xmath39 .",
    "the latter is associated to a homogeneous medium in three dimensions and is represented in the waveguide mode space : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the admittance of the mode in free space : @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the right - hand side ( r.h.s . )",
    "term @xmath44 takes into account the overlap between the incident plane wave and the waveguide mode @xmath21 inside the hole .",
    "considering a normalization for the incident wave such that the energy flux through the hole is unity , @xmath45 , we obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the admittance of the incident plane wave in free space .",
    "once the solution of the system of eqs .   is found and the modal amplitudes are known , the normalized - to - area transmission coefficient can be written as @xmath48    until now we have not mentioned any restrictions on the hole shape , which in our formalism only influences the structure of the waveguide modes @xmath21 . in this paper , however , we restrict ourselves to the consideration of both circular and rectangular holes , where the waveguide modes are known analytically .    for thick films the solution of eqs",
    ".   converges quickly .",
    "the reason is that in the subwavelength limit the amplitudes of the waveguide modes decay inside the hole .",
    "as the decay is characterized by the propagation constants @xmath49 , the higher the waveguide mode index , the weaker its influence on the transmission .",
    "therefore , only a few waveguide modes ( with the smallest decrements ) contribute the transmission .",
    "in contrast , when the thickness @xmath4 of the pec tends to zero , the solution of the system of eqs .",
    "involves many waveguide modes ( hundreds or even thousands ) to provide the precise result .",
    "however , we shall show below that a very accurate computation of the transmission can be performed with some tens of waveguide modes .",
    "we shall find the asymptotic value of the transmission by a fitting of the convergent result .    to conclude this section we shall show how to apply the above equations when the bounding dielectric media have permittivities @xmath50 , @xmath51 . in this case , for a medium with the dielectric constant @xmath52 , the propagation constant of the mode and the admittances become @xmath53 , @xmath42 and @xmath54 .",
    "then the wavelength - dependent tensor @xmath55 describing the interaction of the waveguide modes inside the cavity through the em continuum in vacuum becomes a function of @xmath52 , @xmath56 . in the upper equation of @xmath57",
    "changes to @xmath58 , whereas in the lower to @xmath59 . working out the expression given by eq .",
    ", we find that the relation between the tensors is @xmath60",
    "in this section we show how to simplify computation of the transmission when the linear size of the hole , @xmath61 is small compared to @xmath62 .",
    "more precisely , we consider the limit @xmath63 in this limit an accurate numerical computation of the tensor @xmath57 becomes problematic .",
    "this is related to the orders of magnitude difference between imaginary and real parts of @xmath57 .",
    "we have found that in the low - order in parameter @xmath64 the non - vanishing elements of the tensor depend upon @xmath64 as ( see appendix [ gt ] ) @xmath65 both real and imaginary parts of the tensor are important in spite of their substantial difference : @xmath66 contribute into the amplitude of the waveguide modes ( see below ) , while @xmath67 takes into account the radiation into free - space [ see eq .  ] .",
    "for @xmath68 the imaginary part of the tensor allows analytical computation , and the real part can be considerably simplified ( see details in appendix [ gt ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to normal - incident wave transmission . in this case",
    "the impinging wave can only couple to certain waveguide modes of @xmath69 type .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath57 elements shows that the contribution to the transmission from @xmath70 waveguide modes is always negligible .",
    "this results from both a weak coupling between the waveguide modes of different polarizations inside the small hole , and a weak coupling of @xmath70 waveguide modes to the em continuum of vacuum half - spaces .    for the circular hole the incident plane wave couples directly with only the `` horizontal '' @xmath71 waveguide modes with integer @xmath72 ( where the first index indicates the number of semi - periods of the field placed along the polar angle ) .",
    "coupled between themselves , these waveguide modes are the only ones contributing into the transmission .    for a rectangular hole , when the electric field is directed as shown in fig .",
    "[ geom ] , the illuminated waveguide modes are @xmath73 , with odd @xmath72 ( the first and the second indices define the number of semi - periods of the field placed along @xmath74 and @xmath75 directions respectively ) . only this set of waveguide modes appears in the summation for the transmission according to eq .",
    "[ all other elements of @xmath67 are negligible ] . however , @xmath73 modes couple to @xmath76 ones with even @xmath77 and odd @xmath72 through the system of eqs .   and must be taken into account .",
    "due to property expressed in eq .",

    "with appropriately normalized coefficients @xmath80 where @xmath81 the amplitudes @xmath82 satisfy the system of eqs .  , where the imaginary part of the green tensor is neglected and its real part must be normalized with the small parameter @xmath83 .",
    "the coefficients of eq .   are replaced by @xmath84 , @xmath85 .      in this subsection",
    "we compare the solution based on our formalism with some known results on the transmission through apertures in an infinitesimally thin pec screen . by reaching an excellent agreement with these results ,",
    "we justify the applicability of the modal expansion even in the most unfavorable conditions for it .    in the limit @xmath86 ,",
    "special care is needed when solving system of eqs .   due to the divergency of the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in order to remove this divergency , we expand the amplitudes of the waveguide modes over @xmath87 @xmath88 equating terms proportional to @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90 then , keeping terms of zero - order in @xmath87 , we have from eqs .",
    "@xmath91 adding the two equations in and neglecting the imaginary part of the tensor @xmath57 , due to eq .  , we arrive at the final system of equations @xmath92 now , when the film has been converted into a screen with infinitesimal thickness , the amplitudes of the waveguide modes at the incoming and outgoing faces of the film are equivalent . therefore , the terms @xmath35 and @xmath34 responsible for the reflection and coupling of the waveguide modes inside the cavity are not present in eq .  , and the waveguide mode amplitudes are coupled by the doubled elements of @xmath66 .",

    "therefore , more waveguide modes must be taken into account in order to obtain the correct result .",

    "notice that the normalized transmittance through a square hole with the side @xmath110 is about two times larger than that of the round hole with the radius @xmath0 .    in the case of rectangular holes ,",

    "note that the transmission is not symmetric with respect to the region of incidence : @xmath135 .",
    "this may seem to be paradoxical , as the transmission coefficient of the incident plane wave into the plane wave with the same in - plane wavevector is symmetric due to the symmetry of the scattering matrix .",
    "the total transmittance @xmath136 , however , takes into account the transmission of a plane wave into a _ continuum _ of states . as the density of final states depends on the dielectric constant in the transmission region , so does @xmath136 .",
