    "the determination of the masses of the light quarks represents an important challenge in particle physics today .",
    "they are among the least well determined parameters of the standard model , having uncertainties of the same order as their values as given in the particle data book .",
    "lattice qcd is in a position to improve this situation because it allows one to study the quark mass dependence of physical observables such as hadron masses .",
    "the physical values of these observables can then be used to fix the quark masses .",
    "unfortunately current simulations can not probe the up / down quark mass range directly and so some form of extrapolation is necessary .",
    "chiral perturbation theory is at present the best procedure for providing a link to the low mass regime .",
    "the simulations studied in this paper however are still too heavy for @xmath0 and a simpler extrapolation ansatz is used instead .    in this paper",
    "i present results for the average up / down quark mass , @xmath1 , and the strange quark mass , @xmath2 , from a partially quenched analysis of pseudoscalar and vector meson masses for each of ukqcd s dynamical fermion datasets .",
    "the suitably averaged values of the hadron masses used to fix the quark masses are as follows : @xmath3 ; @xmath4 ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "all of the lattice simulations studied here have been carried out on a @xmath7 lattice with a non - perturbatively o(a)-improved wilson fermion action and standard wilson glue .",
    "details of these simulations have been discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "additionally the set of @xmath8 values for the datasets at @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been increased to @xmath11 .",
    "pseudoscalar and vector meson correlation functions have been generated with all non - degenerate combinations of these @xmath8 values . for the @xmath12 dataset",
    "these correlators have also been calculated at @xmath13 .",
    "the procedures used here to extract hadron masses from correlation functions have been described in detail in @xcite . in brief",
    "the masses of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons were determined from double cosh fits to their corresponding correlation functions .",
    "local and fuzzed correlators were fitted simultaneously to constrain fit parameters and a sliding window analysis used to find an appropriate time window for each fit .",
    "the pseudoscalar meson masses for each dataset were extrapolated in @xmath14 using the simple ansatz    @xmath15    the value of @xmath16 was determined as a free parameter in this fit .    for the vector meson the ansatz @xmath17",
    "was found to fit the data well .",
    "an example plot of these chiral extrapolations is given in figure [ extrap ] for the @xmath12 dataset .",
    "the lightest pseudoscalar and vector points at @xmath13 are included in the plot but were not included in the extrapolation .",
    "the lightest vector point clearly deviates from the linear behaviour suggesting large finite size effects . for more discussion of finite size effects in these datasets",
    "i refer the reader to @xcite .",

    "determination of the light quark masses from the results of the chiral extrapolations requires setting the scale by some physical quantity . in this work",
    "the sommer scale parameter , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 were used .",
    "the average up / down quark mass , @xmath1 , was determined by requiring that the pseudoscalar mass equal the physical pion mass at that point i.e.    @xmath20    the strange quark mass , @xmath2 , was then determined from each of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 by solving    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    when the lattice spacing was fixed by @xmath27 however only the @xmath21 method gave a sensible value for @xmath2 and only these results are given .",
    "in this work the values for the renormalised quark masses are given in the @xmath28 scheme at a reference scale of @xmath29 .",
    "the relationship between the renormalised and bare quark masses is given by the relation    @xmath30    where the matching has been performed at a scale , @xmath31 . running the masses from the scale , @xmath31 , to a scale of @xmath29",
    "was achieved using the mathematica package , rundec @xcite , which implements 4-loop running from perturbation theory .",
    "one - loop tadpole - improved perturbative results @xcite were used for @xmath32 and @xmath33 reorganised in terms of @xmath34    @xmath35u_0^{-1}\\ ] ]    @xmath36 u_0^{-1}\\ ] ]    the tadpole factor , @xmath37 , was taken to be @xmath38 here .",
    "an estimation of the best value for the matching scale , @xmath39 @xcite , has not been determined for this work . instead the cases @xmath40 and @xmath41 have been investigated and the variation treated as a systematic effect .",
    "the values of @xmath34 were also determined with the rundec package using values for @xmath42 given in @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been plotted in figures [ mlight ] and [ mstrange ] respectively .",
    "datasets matched in @xmath27 have been distinguished from the others and a matched quenched dataset included for comparison . only results for @xmath40",
    "are plotted as choice of matching scale was found to have around a @xmath43 effect .",
    "the results for @xmath44 are omitted as they were almost identical to those for @xmath45 .",
    "a large dependence on the choice of scale setting parameter can be seen for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it should be noted however that a smaller physical value for @xmath27 would bring the results into better agreement .",
    "there is also a clear difference between @xmath46 and @xmath45 though this would be expected to vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "there is some indication of a trend in the matched datasets as the sea quark mass is decreased , as expected .",
    "when compared to the matched quenched point however there is no clear signal of unquenching from either quark mass though this may improve with statistics .",
    "the ratio , @xmath47 , was calculated for each scheme and found to be between @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath46 and around @xmath50 for @xmath45 .",
    "this can be compared with the result from @xmath0 @xcite of @xmath51 .    .",
