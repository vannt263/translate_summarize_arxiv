    "this paper is devoted to the hermite interpolation with the surfaces possessing pythagorean normal vector fields ( pn surfaces ) .",
    "these surfaces were introduced by @xcite .",
    "we can understand them as surface counterparts to the pythagorean hodograph ( ph ) curves first studied by @xcite .",
    "pn surfaces have rational offsets and thus provide an elegant solution to many offset - based problems occurring in various practical applications .",
    "in particular , in the context of the computer - aided manufacturing , the tool path does not have to be approximated and it can be described exactly in the nurbs form , which is nowadays a standard format of the cad / cam applications .    for the survey of the theory and applications of ph / pn objects , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "many interesting theoretical questions related to this subject have been studied in the past years .",
    "let us mention in particular the analysis of the geometric and algebraic properties of the offsets , such as the determination of the number and type of their components and the construction of their suitable rational parameterizations @xcite .",
    "despite natural similarities between the ph curves and the pn surfaces , the two classes of pythagorean objects exhibit also some important differences .",
    "for example , the set of all polynomial ph curves within the set of all rational ph / pn curves was exactly identified in @xcite . on the other hand for the pn surfaces only the rational ones are described explicitly using a dual representation and the subset of the polynomial ones have not been revealed yet .",
    "polynomial solution of the pythagorean condition in the surface case started in @xcite for cubic parameterizations and recently an approach based on bivariate polynomials with quaternion coefficients was presented by @xcite . a survey discussing rational surfaces with rational offsets and their modelling applications",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "the previous problem is also strongly related to the construction techniques for pn surfaces , in particular to the hermite interpolation , which is the main topic of this paper . there",
    "exist many hermite interpolation results for the polynomial and rational ph curves yielding piecewise curves of various continuity , see @xcite . concerning direct algorithms for the interpolations with pn surfaces",
    "the situation is different . by ` direct ' we mean in this context the construction of the object together with its pn parameterization .",
    "indeed , some constructions for special surfaces , which become pn only after a suitable reparameterization , were designed .",
    "for instance in @xcite , there was designed a method for the construction of the exact offsets of quadratic triangular bzier surface patches , which are in fact pn surfaces .",
    "however their pn parameterizations were gained via certain reparameterization . a similar approach based on reparameterization",
    "was also used in the paper @xcite devoted to the surfaces with linear normals @xcite , which generally admit a non - proper pn parameterizations , see @xcite for more explanations .",
    "first we emphasize that our method requires that given points being interpolated are arranged in a rectangular grid ; for further details about quadrilateral mesh generation and processing , including surface analysis and mesh quality , simplification , adaptive refinement , etc .",
    "we refer to survey paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "next , unlike the approaches presented in the papers cited in the previous paragraph we plan to interpolate a set of given points @xmath1 with the associated normal vectors @xmath2 by a rational parameterized pn surface in a direct way , i.e. , without the necessary subsequent reparameterization .",
    "the advantage of such direct pn interpolation techniques is obvious  no complicated trimming procedure in the parameter space is necessary . as far as we are aware",
    ", a similar method was discussed only in @xcite , where a surface design scheme with triangular patches on parabolic dupin cyclides was proposed .",
    "in addition , in @xcite the interpolation of triangular data using the support function is studied .",
    "the gauss image is first constructed and then the support function interpolating the values and gradients at certain points ( the given normals ) is determined .",
    "our approach interpolates the normals and the support function simultaneously in the isotropic space . this way we are able to produce local patches with global @xmath0 continuity .    in the beginning of this paper",
    ", we also very shortly address the related open problem of the hermite interpolation with the _ polynomial _ pn surfaces .",
    "rather than solve this problem , we show its complexity . indeed ,",
    "by simply considering the required number of free parameters we show that this problem is much harder than in the curve case .",
    "we use this consideration as a certain defense for using a dual technique , which leads to rational solutions .",
    "even so we consider the hermite interpolation with polynomial pn surfaces directly as a promising and challenging direction for our future research .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  @xmath3 recalls some basic facts concerning surfaces with pythagorean normal vector fields .",
    "we will also briefly sketch how to satisfy the pn condition in the polynomial case , i.e. , how to find polynomial pn parameterizations . in section 3",
    "the representation of pn surfaces in the blaschke and in the isotropic model is presented .",
    "we also discuss the usefulness of these representations for the solution of the interpolation problem .",
    "section 4 is devoted to bicubic coons patches in the isotropic model and their usage in the construction of smooth pn surfaces .",
    "the method is described , discussed and presented on a particular example in section  5 .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  6 .",
    "in this section we recall some fundamental facts about surfaces with rational offsets .",
    "let @xmath4 be a real algebraic surface in @xmath5 , let @xmath6 denote the set of regular points of @xmath4 , and let us denote by @xmath7 a unit normal vector at a point @xmath8 .",
    "then the _ @xmath9-offset _",
    "@xmath10 of @xmath11 is defined as the closure of the set @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath11 is rational and @xmath13 is its parameterization , we may write down a parameterization of the offset explicitly in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unit normal vector field associated to the parameterization @xmath16 . it turns out that is rational if and only if @xmath15 is .",
    "this is equivalent to the existence of a rational function @xmath17 such that @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are partial derivatives with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 regular parametric surfaces fulfilling condition are called _ surfaces with pythagorean normal vector fields _ ( or _ pn surfaces _ , in short ) and condition is referred to as _ pn condition _ or _ pn property_.    pn surfaces were defined by @xcite as surface analogies to pythagorean hodograph ( ph ) curves distinguished by the ph condition @xmath24 .",
    "these curves were introduced as planar polynomial objects .",
    "later , the concept was generalized also to the rational ph curves , see @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the different approaches to polynomial and rational curves with pythagorean hodographs was studied by @xcite and the former were established as a proper subset of the latter by presenting simple algebraic constraints .",
    "unfortunately more than 20 years from their introduction , the situation is still completely different for the pn surfaces .",
    "this is also reflected when solving the interpolation problems , in which the points and the normal vectors are prescribed as input data .",
    "the most natural ( and expected ) way of handling the pn surfaces would be probably similar to the one used for ph curves , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us show it on the polynomial case .",
    "all the polynomials satisfying the ph condition @xmath25 can be described explicitly using polynomial pythagorean triples .",
    "the corresponding ph curve @xmath26 is then obtained simply by integration . in the surface case , however , we can not reproduce this approach .",
    "it is possible to describe explicitly all the polynomial pythagorean normal fields @xmath27 of degree @xmath28 having the polynomial length , i.e. , @xmath29 is a perfect square ; cf .",
    "@xcite . to determine an associated pn parameterization of degree @xmath30 in a direct way",
    ", we have to find suitable polynomial vector fields @xmath31 \\displaystyle { \\mathbf{q}}(u , v)= \\left ( \\sum_{i+j\\leq\\ell } \\mbox{\\hspace*{-0ex}}q_{1ij}{u^iv^j } , \\sum_{i+j\\leq\\ell } \\mbox{\\hspace*{-0ex}}q_{2ij}{u^iv^j } , \\sum_{i+j\\leq\\ell } \\mbox{\\hspace*{-0ex}}q_{3ij}{u^iv^j } \\right ) , \\end{array}\\ ] ] which will play the role of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , respectively , that satisfy the following conditions @xmath32 \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{p}}}{\\partial v } - \\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial{\\mathbf{q}}}{\\partial u } & = & 0 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the third equation expresses the condition for the  integrability .",
    "since a polynomial of degree @xmath33 in two variables possesses @xmath34 coefficients , the problem is now transformed to solving a system of @xmath35 homogeneous linear equations with @xmath36 unknowns @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding pn parameterization is then obtain as @xmath38_{u=0}.\\ ] ]    however , we must stress that not for every given polynomial pythagorean normal field @xmath27 there exists a corresponding polynomial surface @xmath39 for which @xmath40 . for this to hold we need @xmath41 .",
    "nevertheless , in this case the number of unknowns is less than the number of equations so one can not expect a solution , in general . on the other hand for @xmath42 large enough , the system of equations is solvable . in this case",
    "we obviously arrive at a pn parameterization such that @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is some non - constant polynomial .",
    "as the offsets have a considerably simplier description if we apply the dual approach , we recall in this section the representation of pn surfaces in the blaschke and isotropic model of the dual space . moreover , this concept is later used for formulating our hermite interpolation algorithm .    for the sake of brevity ,",
    "we exclude developable surfaces from our considerations and assume a non - degenerated gauss image @xmath45 of all studied surfaces @xmath4 in what follows .",
    "this means that the _ duality _ @xmath46 maps a surface @xmath4 to its _ dual surface @xmath47_. recall that a non - developable surface @xmath48 has the _ dual representation _",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 is a homogeneous polynomial in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 then the set of all planes @xmath54 forms a  system of _ tangent planes _ of @xmath11 with the normal vectors @xmath55 ( i.e. , @xmath47 is considered as the set of tangent planes of @xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore , if we assume @xmath56 then the value of @xmath52 is the oriented distance of the tangent plane to the origin .",
    "moreover , if the partial derivative @xmath57 does not vanish at @xmath58 , then implicitly defines a function @xmath59 in a certain neighborhood of @xmath60 .",
    "the restriction of this function to the unit sphere @xmath61 is called the _ support function _ of the primal surface , see @xcite for more details .",
    "let us stress out that that the dual representation does not require the normal vectors @xmath55 to be unit vectors .",
    "however , whenever we use the support function then its argument @xmath55 will be assumed to be a unit vector .",
    "conversely , from any smooth real function on ( a subset of ) @xmath62 we can reconstruct the corresponding primal surface by the parameterization @xmath63 @xmath64 where the vector @xmath65 is obtained by embedding the intrinsic gradient of @xmath52 with respect to @xmath62 into the space @xmath5 , see @xcite for more details .",
    "the vector - valued function @xmath66 gives a parameterization of the envelope of the set of tangent planes .",
    "hence , all surfaces with the associated rational support function are rational .",
    "it is enough to substitute into any rational parameterization of @xmath62 , for instance @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , several important geometric operations correspond to suitable modifications of the support function , see @xcite .",
    "in particular the one - sided offset of a surface at the distance @xmath9 is obtained by adding the constant @xmath9 to the support function @xmath52 . for using the support function for computing the convolutions ( i.e. , the general offsets ) of two hypersurfaces",
    "see e.g. @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the rational surfaces with rational offsets were studied in the so - called blaschke model .",
    "consider in @xmath68 the quadric @xmath69 .",
    "this quadratic cylinder is called the _",

    "what follows the map that sends a point in @xmath4 to the tangent plane , i.e. , a point in @xmath47 , is called the _ blaschke mapping _ and is denoted @xmath72 .",
    "any non - developable pn surface is the image of a rational surface on the blaschke cylinder @xmath73 via the mapping @xmath74 .",

    "if @xmath89 is regular then it is a @xmath0 piecewise rational surface with pythagorean normals .    by the regularity of @xmath90 we mean that at every point there is a suitable tangent plane so that the projection of the surface to this plane is a homeomorphism on some neighborhood of this point",
    "this essentially means that we exclude the sharp edges ( ridges ) .",
    "conditions for the regularity are discussed in more detail in the paragraph following this proof .",
    "we have @xmath87 .",
    "the mapping @xmath91 ( and its inverse ) is a diffeomorphism which does not change the continuity .",
    "so the patch @xmath92 on the blaschke cylinder is clearly also @xmath23 .",
    "the mapping @xmath93 is given by formula , which contains the first order differentiation .",
    "for this reason the surface @xmath89 is only  @xmath94 .",
    "however , in fact the continuity of @xmath92 describes a continuous variation of a certain well defined plane .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if @xmath90 is regular then the inversion of the projection to this plane is locally @xmath23 which shows the global @xmath0 continuity of @xmath90 .",
    "as it has been noticed earlier @xcite despite the fact that the variation of the planes in the previous proposition is continuous , the resulting surface may sometimes exhibit sharp edges ( ridges ) . to understand this phenomena",
    "let us first investigate , for the sake of simplicity , two examples of planar curves , see fig .",
    "[ ridges ] . in this case",
    "@xmath95 is univariate and the function @xmath96 gives the oriented radius of curvature @xcite .",
    "if this expression vanishes the curve exhibits a cusp at which the curvature goes to infinity .",
    "the first example is a part of a hypocycloid ( fig .",
    "[ ridges ] , left ) where the support function @xmath95 is perfectly smooth but still a cusp occurs .",
    "the second example ( fig .  [ ridges ] , right ) shows two circle segments connected tangentially and producing a sharp jump in the signed curvature .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a similar behavior can be described for surfaces . in this case",
    "the critical expression ( corresponding to @xmath96 ) is the matrix function @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes the intrinsic hessian with respect to the unit sphere @xmath99 ( the base of the blaschke cylinder @xmath100 ) and @xmath101 is the identity .",
    "in fact as shown in @xcite , it holds that @xmath102 , so this quantity allows us to control the features of the resulting surface .",
    "vanishing of the @xmath103 or a jump in the signs of one its eigenvalues indicates the occurrence of a sharp edge . for practical modeling purposes",
    "let us remark , that a sharp edge typically occurs when the data from a surface with parabolic curves are interpolated .",
    "in other cases this phenomena will disappear under subdivision . furthermore , as our method is based on the construction of coons patches with boundaries being fergusson cubics determined by suitably chosen tangent vectors at given points in the isotropic space ( see section  [ sec isotr ] ) , it is theoretically also possible to avoid ridges by optimizing the lengths of the tangent vectors ( which can serve as free modelling shape parameters , see section  [ sec alg ] ) with a suitable objective function .",
    "one can for example use the function @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the area element on the sphere and @xmath106 is the gauss image of the constructed surface .",
    "in fact @xmath107 and when minimizing its integral we can avoid the ridges at which the gauss curvature @xmath108 tends to infinity , see also @xcite .",
