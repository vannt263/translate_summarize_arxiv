    "v sge is a peculiar variable star which has been receiving outstanding attention from various researchers .",
    "the short - period binary nature of v sge was revealed by @xcite , who classified it as a ",
    "nova - like \" variable star mainly from the presence of high excitation emission lines characteristic to novae and related systems .",
    "the nature of the binary components in v sge was unclear at the time of @xcite .",
    "more recent observations ( e.g. @xcite ) suggested that the binary contains a compact accretor , which is most likely a white dwarf . although there have been claims of different interpretations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the recent detection of the supersoft x - rays ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a potentially different state ) led to the re - classification of v sge as a galactic luminous supersoft x - ray source ( ssxs ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular , @xcite proposed a new class of variable stars ( v sge being its prototype ) in line with the ssxs interpretation .",
    "v sge is known to show long - term light variations characterized by high and low state , and occasionally with intermediate states ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the origin of this light variation had long been a mystery , @xcite recently proposed a mechanism involving time - evolution of the wind from a luminous white dwarf , time - evolution of the accretion disk , and negative feedback by the wind on the mass - transfer from the secondary star .",
    "although the light curve of v sge between the years 19901996 seems to have been phenomenologically well reproduced by this model , we noticed a significant departure in the 2003 light curve from what is expected from @xcite .",
    "we thereby report on this observation for future discussions and theoretical modeling .",
    "we examined the observations of v sge posted to vsnet collaboration @xcite.http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet/@xmath1 . ]",
    "the observations used @xmath2-band comparison stars , and typical errors of individual estimates are smaller than 0.3 mag , which would not affect the following discussion .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows a segment of the 2003 light curve of v sge showing unusual light variation .",
    "the variation was characterized by a slow gradual brightening by 1.5 mag , followed by a sudden drop within 3 d. this feature seems to recur with a time scale of @xmath030 d.    ( 88mm,60mm)fig1.eps",
    "following the model by @xcite , the limit cycle oscillation responsible for the recurrence of low and high states in v sge involves the negative feedback of mass - transfer caused by the stripping of the secondary star by the wind from the primary . as shown in @xcite , this process would naturally require _ gradual fading _ during the wind phase , in which the mass - transfer from the secondary is gradually reduced .",
    "the present observation shows the perfectly contrary sequence of high / low state transitions , showing a gradual brightening and a sudden drop , with the amplitude comparable to the high / low state transitions observed previously .",
    "this difference can be best demonstrated by the comparison with figure 13 in @xcite .",
    "the recurrence time ( @xmath0 30 d ) is also much shorter than what can be expected from the reasonable parameter ranges presented in @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests that at least some stage of variations in v sge is not driven by the limit - cycle oscillation involving the mass - transfer variation from the secondary star .",
    "v sge displayed an evolution of its activity over the last @xmath070 years @xcite and switched from one type of photometric activity to another on the time scale of years several times .",
    "the behavior in figure [ fig : lc ] then represents appearance of another type .",
    "considering the present noticeable departure of v sge itself from the model light curves and the short transition time scale , a different mechanism should be sought , including the intrinsic instability in the disk or wind in a high - luminosity object .",
    "it would be worth noting that the symbiotic star ch cyg occasionally shows high / low state transitions similar to that of v sge @xcite .",
    "if the variation in ch cyg is indeed analogous to v sge - type high / low state transitions , a mechanism involving the mass - transfer variation from the secondary star would not be able to explain the observed time scale in such a long - period binary as in ch cyg .",
    "an alternative ( although not yet identified ) mechanism in v sge might be a clue to understanding the common underlying physics among a wide diversity of high - luminosity accreting systems ranging from v sge stars to symbiotic binaries",
    ". it would be worth noting that a wind - driven mechanism has been proposed for variable mass - accretion rate in symbiotic binaries @xcite , which may be also applicable to v sge with strong winds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we are grateful to many amateur observers for supplying their vital visual and ccd estimates via vsnet .",
    "the author is grateful to an anonymous referee for drawing attention to the work by bisikalo et al .",
    "this work is partly supported by a grant - in - aid ( 13640239 , 15037205 ) from the japanese ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ."
