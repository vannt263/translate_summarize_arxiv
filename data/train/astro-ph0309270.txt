    "radio quiet quasars and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies are the sources expected to accrete mass at a high rate ( e.g. ref .",
    "the spectra of those objects show similarity in their shape ( fig .",
    "[ exmpl ] ) .",
    "the idea of the universal spectral shape of those galaxies appears in the literature since many years ( e.g. ref .",
    "it is well known that the simplest standard shakura - sunyaev disk model , under assumption of the local black body emission , can not account for the observed x - ray spectra of agn .",
    "the model is also not quite satisfactory in the optical / uv band .",
    "we propose two modifications to the standard model which directly result from our knowledge of the accretion disk physics and an agn surrounding .",
    "the warm absorber is a significantly ionized medium present in our line of sight towards sources .",
    "it produces narrow absorption lines and absorption continua in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the medium temperature is of order of @xmath0-@xmath1 k. the column density is frequently of order of @xmath2 @xmath3 or more .",
    "the warm absorber is extended but probably clumpy ( e.g. ref .",
    "most of the radiation from the nucleus of the considered objects is emitted in the frequency range @xmath4-@xmath5 hz . in this range",
    "the electron scattering dominates the total crossection .",
    "the warm absorber actually predominatly scatters the incoming photons ( fig .",
    "[ kabs ] ) instead of absorbing them ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we envision the geometry in fig .",
    "we neglect the clumpiness of the medium and assume that it is located predominantly along the symmetry axis , @xmath6 .",
    "we parameterize the region by the total optical depth for electron scattering , @xmath7 , minimum @xmath8 and maximum @xmath9 distance of the warm absorber from the nucleus .",
    "we assume that the density profile of the warm absorber is @xmath10 .",
    "for purpose of the rough estimate of modifying disk spectrum we do not introduce any specific dependence on the distance from the symmetry axis .",
    "the irradiation of the disk at a distance @xmath11 from the center can be approximately represented as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bolometric luminosity of an accretion disk and @xmath14 is the fraction of emission from the nucleus passing through the warm absorber .",
    "the warm absorber modifies the emerged spectrum ( predominatly at longer wavelengths  optical and the ir band ) .",
    "the effect is only weakly influenced by @xmath9 and the density distribution @xmath15 .",
    "more important is the exact location of the inner edge , @xmath8 .",
    "the exemplary spectrum is are shown by dashed line in fig .",
    "[ decompo ] .",
    "comptonization of a fraction of disk photons is clearly needed in order to reproduce the soft x - ray part of the spectrum . in",
    "the high luminosity objects the disk extends down to the marginally stable orbit and some warm skin covers the inner region .",
    "similar interpretation holds both for galactic black holes in their high state or very high state and for luminous agn ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we propose a natural constraint for the properties of this warm skin based on stability analysis in the radiation pressure dominated region of the disk .",
    "we assume that the accretion disk is azimuthaly divided into two layers : inner cold part and a warm comptonizing skin ( fig .",
    "[ wasp ] ) .",
    "we futher assume that fraction of the energy is transported from the disk interior towards the skin as a magnetic flux .",
    "in this way proceed the heating of the warm skin .",
    "therefore , the energy balance of the disk interior reads : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the energy flux dissipated in the disk interior , @xmath18 is the radiative cooling of the disk interior .",
    "@xmath19 is the magnetically transported flux and @xmath20 ( @xmath21  the energy density of the magnetic field , @xmath22  the alfven velocity , @xmath23  the disk thickness , @xmath24  the pressure ) .",
    "the warm skin is heated by flux tubes which cover only a fraction of the boundary surface .",
    "we assume that this covering is proportional to the disk thicknes , @xmath23 .",
    "the disk is thermally stable if : @xmath25 our calculations show that the presence of magnetic transport stabilizes the disk since its dependence on the temperature is steep enough ( the same as in the case of advection ) . when @xmath26 the disk already becomes stable even if strongly dominated by the radiation pressure .",
    "we therefore consider it possible that the disk in a natural way develops this magnetically mediated transport in the radiation pressure dominated region .",
    "this region of the disk would be therefore covered with a warm skin and the transport efficiency saturates at the value @xmath27 .",
    "the skin cools predominantly by comptonization .",
    "the cooling efficiency is fixed by the parameter @xmath28 , i.e. the compton amplification factor , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30    therefore , the condition @xmath31 roughly determines the slope , @xmath32 , of the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "it provides a constraint for the combination of the skin optical depth , @xmath33 , and its temperature , @xmath34 .",
    "the role of the irradiation and the comptonization by the warm absorber and disk skin is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ decompo ] .",
    "the model does not fit exactly the observed data points ( fig .",
    "[ sp ] ) since our aim of our model is to reproduce in a possibly natural way the scaling of the spectra with mass and not fitting .",
    ".summary of model parameters . [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we develop a model which is appropriate for high luminosity objects like quasars and nls1 galaxies .",
    "we propose two mechanisms which together may be responible for the relatively uniform spectral shape of the agn luminosities in term of @xmath35 .",
    "first mechanism is back - scattering of the light emerged from disk by warm absorber .",
    "second mechanism is the comptonization in the marginally stable accretion disk warm skin .      * irradiation results in softer / uv spectra than predicted by classical disc models . *",
    "the warm skin stabilizes the radiation pressure dominated disk . *",
    "it comptonizes the disk emission and the soft x - ray part of the spectrum is produced . *",
    "the condition of stability leads to a specific value of the compton amplification factor ( @xmath36 ) which roughly determines the soft x - ray slope . *",
    "both effects lead to the radiation spectrum which shape does not strongly depend on the parameters .",
    "lower luminosity agn ( in terms of @xmath35 ) , like seyfert galaxies , are not expected to be represented by the discussed model . in those sources",
    "the disk evaporation is most probably very effective , as expected from the models ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the inner disk is replaced with a hot , possibly advection dominated flow ( e.g. ref .",
