    "in fig.[fig.tdep]a , we show the temperature dependence of the @xmath13 bragg intensity as a function of the scattering vector @xmath17 , which is measured by the @xmath18 mode corresponding to scans along the radial direction from the origin in the reciprocal space . at high temperatures above @xmath2 , in both crystals",
    "we have a single peak with a narrow width . from the full width at half maximum ,",
    "the distribution of lattice constant is estimated as @xmath19 , which is more than a factor of @xmath20 smaller than that in the previous studies @xcite , indicating very high crystalline quality of our samples . upon entering the hidden - order phase below @xmath2 , the data for @xmath21 sample shows no significant change in its shape , but for much cleaner sample with @xmath22 the single peak above @xmath2 suddenly changes to a broadened shape with clear splitting . at low temperatures the split peaks can be reasonably fitted to two gaussian peaks with the widths comparable to the high - temperature data above @xmath2 ( fig.[fig.tdep]b ) , from which the orthorhombicity @xmath23 is estimated , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the two peak angles .",
    "the change in the lattice constant @xmath26 for @xmath21 sample is consistent with the previous high - resolution larmor diffraction measurements of @xmath27 bragg peak for a similar @xmath21 sample @xcite at ambient pressure ( fig.[fig.tdep]c ) . in sharp contrast",
    ", our new data on the ultraclean sample clearly shows a splitting into two different lattice constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 below @xmath2 , evidencing the transition to the orthorhombic state .",
    "we note that these lattice constants do not track the data for the antiferromagnetic phase under pressure @xcite and rather show an opposite trend that the averaged constant increases just below @xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that our splitting can not be explained by some inclusion of impurity or strain - induced phase having antiferromagnetism .",
    "we will discuss the implications of the crystal - purity dependence later , and now we focus on the data of the ultraclean sample",
    ".    the temperature dependence of the orthorhombicity @xmath30 is demonstrated in fig.[fig.tdep]d .",
    "the orthorhombicity sets in just below @xmath2 , indicating that the lattice symmetry change is clearly associated with the hidden - order transition .",
    "remarkably , unlike the continuous change expected in the order parameter at a second - order phase transition , @xmath31 shows a sudden jump at @xmath2 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the transition at @xmath2 , which has been believed to be of second order , has a first - order nature .",
    "the fact that the latent heat has not been reported @xcite indicates that the first - order nature is very weak ; at @xmath2 the discontinuity of the order parameter that characterises the low - temperature phase may be too small to be detected thermodynamically .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that the hidden order transition is a weakly first - order phase transition accompanied by lattice symmetry breaking from fourfold tetragonal to twofold orthorhombic structure .",
    "the present result is consistent with the @xmath32si nmr width measured under in - plane magnetic fields @xcite , which shows very similar temperature dependence with a clear jump at @xmath2 ( fig.[fig.tdep]d ) .",
    "it has been suggested in a recent theory that the hyperfine fields at the si site for an antiferroic @xmath33-type order , which has an in - plane twofold anisotropy , can lead to the nmr broadening below the transition @xcite .",
    "thus this naturally implies a close correspondence between the orthorhombicity and nmr broadening as found in experiments .    to verify that the peak split originates from the lattice symmetry change to the @xmath5-type orthorhombic structure , we performed two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath34 $ ] scans near the @xmath13 bragg peak ( fig.[fig.2d ] ) . at 10k below @xmath2 ,",
    "the data reveals a twin - peak structure ( fig.[fig.2d]a ) in contrast to the single peak above @xmath2 ( fig.[fig.2d]b ) . here",
    "the integrated intensities above and below the transition are identical within experimental error , demonstrating that the twin peaks originate from the splitting of the @xmath13 bragg peak .",
    "the elongated deformation along @xmath35 $ ] direction is due to worse resolution along this line as well as finite mosaicness inevitably present in the crystal .",
    "it should be stressed that the peak split along @xmath36 $ ] direction found below @xmath2 ( fig.[fig.2d]d ) , which can not be accounted for by the mosaicness , definitely indicates the appearance of two distinct lattice - plane spacings inside the crystal ( reflecting the domain formation ) .",
    "we also find that along @xmath35 $ ] direction , although the peak does not show a clear split , it exhibits finite broadening below @xmath2 ( fig.[fig.2d]e ) .",
    "this indicates that the split occurs on two directions in the @xmath34 $ ] plane , indicating that the single bragg peak above @xmath2 split into four peaks in the hidden - order phase . to show the consistency with the split into four peaks expected in the orthorhombic @xmath5-type structure @xcite ( fig.[fig.structure]f )",
    ", we shift the high - temperature data at 19k to four directions as sketched in the inset of fig.[fig.2d]c and add the four shifted data with the same weight .",
    "the calculated result shown in fig.[fig.2d]c is remarkably consistent with the measured data at 10k ( fig.[fig.2d]a ) .",
    "the line cuts of this result also reproduce the salient features of the 10-k data ( figs.[fig.2d]d , e ) , namely the clear split along @xmath36 $ ] and broadened peak along @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the amount of the shifts in the calculation corresponds to the orthorhombicity @xmath37 , which is quantitatively consistent with the @xmath18 scan data in fig.[fig.tdep ] .",
    "these results provide direct evidence that the lattice symmetry is lowered from the tetragonal @xmath4 to orthorhombic @xmath5-type with the formation of four domains , and that the fourfold rotational symmetry is broken at the hidden - order transition .",
    "the in - plane electronic anisotropy elongated along the @xmath3 $ ] direction reported in the in - plane field rotation experiments @xcite is fully compatible with this @xmath5-type symmetry .",
    "it should be emphasized that the present results are obtained at zero field , demonstrating that such electronic nematicity is not field induced .",
    "the formation of micro - domains evident from the multi - peak structure is also consistent with the above reports .",
    "we note that the intensity ratio of the two peaks is temperature dependent ( fig.[fig.tdep]a ) with the integrated intensity unchanged ( figs.[fig.2d]a , b ) .",
    "this suggests that the domain size and the position of domain walls change with temperature in the very clean crystal .",
    "this opens the possibility of ` detwinning ' by an external force , which may be related to the recent report that the thermal expansion anomaly at @xmath2 increases rapidly with application of extremely small in - plane uniaxial pressure @xcite .",
    "the present results clarify the space symmetry of the hidden - order phase , which breaks fourfold rotational symmetry .",
    "this , along with the first - order nature revealed in this study , places very tight constraints on the genuine hidden order parameter . among the allowed irreducible representations for the hidden order ( four non - degenerate @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and one degenerate @xmath42 symmetries ) , the orthorhombic @xmath5-type space group symmetry pins down that the hidden order belongs to the @xmath42-type ,",
    "more specifically @xmath43 with @xmath44 , in which the sign of @xmath45 determines the nematic direction of the domain @xcite .",
    "this establishes a solid base for the recently proposed nematic / hastatic order with in - plane anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of orthorhombicity @xmath30 is of the order of @xmath46 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of similar structural transitions from tetragonal @xmath4 to orthorhombic @xmath5 phase in isomorphic bafe@xmath1as@xmath1-based iron - pnictide superconductors @xcite .",
    "this smallness of the lattice change implies that the hidden - order transition is driven by an electronic ordering , and small but finite electron - lattice coupling gives rise to the lattice distortion .",
    "it should be noted that several experiments on the electronic structure provide strong evidence of the band folding over the wave vector @xmath47 @xcite . such an antiferroic ordering is expected to couple weakly to the `` ferroic '' ( @xmath48 ) orthorhombic distortion .",
    "we also note that the elastic constants , which are also @xmath48 quantities , exhibit only small changes at @xmath2 @xcite , and it has been pointed out that these are consistent with several different symmetries including the @xmath49-type state @xcite , which is compatible with our results .",
    "another remarkable finding is that the symmetry - breaking orthorhombic lattice distortion is quite sensitive to disorder ( fig.[fig.tdep]a ) .",
    "the fact that even the low-@xmath10 samples exhibit clear signatures of the transition in the specific heat measurements @xcite indicates that the @xmath47 band folding is a robust feature against disorder .",
    "however , the transition temperature @xmath2 shows a discernible decrease with lowering @xmath10 @xcite , which implies that impurities can perturb the hidden order .",
    "such unusual impurity effects may be related to the rotational degree of freedom of the nematic direction inside the @xmath7 plane in the degenerate @xmath42-type orders .",
    "indeed the choice of the @xmath3 $ ] direction can be made by the spin - orbit coupling , which creates small energy differences for different in - plane directions .",
    "then impurities can induce disorder in the nematic direction , which may prevent the long - range lattice distortion through nontrivial different-@xmath50 coupling between the antiferroic order and underlying lattice .",
    "we also note that similar high sensitivity to disorder has been found in the electronic nematic phase in sr@xmath51ru@xmath1o@xmath52 where the nematic anisotropy is found only in very clean samples @xcite .",
    "thus the impurity effects of nematic orders in strongly correlated electron systems appear to be an intriguing issue that deserves further investigations .",
    "high - quality single crystals of uru@xmath1si@xmath1 were grown by the czochralski method in a tetra - arc furnace under argon gas atmosphere and subsequently purified by using the solid state electro - transport method under ultrahigh vacuum @xcite .",
    "we used single crystals from two different batches , and the transport measurements in the crystals in these batches indicate that the residual resistivity ratios are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "the crystal structure analysis was performed by the synchrotron x - ray at spring-8 ( bl02b1 ) .",
    "the sample was cut or crushed into small pieces and the crystalline quality of more than @xmath55 samples was checked at room temperature by using an imaging plate ( ip ) .",
    "we have selected crystals with the sharpest bragg spots at high angles for each batch .",
    "the selected best ultraclean crystal with @xmath56 used in this study has dimensions of @xmath57m@xmath58 .",
    "typical bragg peak profiles for @xmath13 of this sample at room temperature are shown in fig.s1a and its inset , which are taken by the four - circle diffractometer at 17.15kev and by the ip at 18.8kev , respectively .",
    "we find no tails of the peak in any direction in the ip image , and similarly circular intensity profiles were obtained for four equivalent bragg peaks @xmath59 , which indicates that no significant strain is present in this crystal .",
    "the temperature of the sample is controlled by a cryocooler equipped in the four - circle diffractometer . to expose a large portion of the crystal to the x - ray beam",
    ", we placed the sample on a fine silver wire ( with a diameter of @xmath60 m ) attached to the cold head .",
    "the x - ray beam size is larger than the sample size .",
