    "the parameters are @xmath186 k , @xmath204 , @xmath190 , and @xmath189 .",
    "[ swfit ] ]      we will now discuss the optical conductivity with coulomb scatterers which are generally present in graphene on a substrate @xcite . in figure [ fig_sw ] , we plot the conductivity of a graphene plane in units of @xmath197 , including the effect of midgap states , charged impurities and phonons .",
    "again , the main feature is that the conductivity is finite in the range @xmath200 and increases as the gate voltage decreases .",
    "we choose the concentration of midgap states in fig .",
    "[ fig_sw ] to be one order of magnitude smaller than the one of coulomb scatterers@xcite , and therefore the conductivity is mainly controlled by phonons and charged impurities .    another feature of the curves in fig . [ fig_sw ] is the large broadening of the interband transition edge at @xmath205 ( indicated by vertical dashed lines ) .",
    "note that this broadening is not due to temperature but to charged impurities , instead .",
    "in fact , the broadening for all values of @xmath185 is larger when the conductivity is controlled by charged impurities rather than by midgap states .",
    "the coupling to phonons produces a feature centered at @xmath207 where @xmath208 denotes the lo - phonon energy corresponding to the wave number 1600@xmath59 ( indicated by shorter dotted - dashed vertical lines ) . for gate voltages with @xmath209",
    "there appears a similar feature at @xmath210 which is not washed out by disorder .",
    "the optical phonons thus induce a conductivity larger than @xmath18 around these frequencies .",
    "this effect is washed out at larger temperatures and @xmath211 .",
    "all these effects are consistent with the recent infrared measurements of graphene on a sio@xmath14 substrate @xcite which are shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ swfit ] .",
    "notice that there is only one fitting parameter involved which is adjusted by the conductivity curve at zero chemical potential .",
    "whereas for low gate voltage the agreement is good , there is considerable weight missing for higher gate voltage ( @xmath212 volts ) .",
    "nevertheless , all theoretical lines predict lower conductivity than the experimental measurements , such that our model with only one fitting parameter is consistent .",
    "since we have included in our calculation all possible one - particle scattering mechanisms , the missing weight at large gate voltages could be attributed to electron - electron interactions in graphene , which become important at this electronic densities .",
    "in this paper we have computed the optical conductivity of graphene at finite chemical potential , generalizing the results of ref .",
    "the calculation includes both the effect of disorder ( mid - gap states and charged impurities , which have a different signature in the dc conductivity@xcite ) and the effect of phonons ( optical and acoustic ) .",
    "it is shown that at low temperatures the effect of acoustic phonons in negligible , since it induces an imaginary part of the electrons self - energy that is much smaller than the imaginary part induced by the impurities . for a discussion based on the boltzmann equation ,",
    "see ref . .",
    "the imaginary part induced by optical phonons is of the order of the imaginary part induced by impurities .",
    "still , optical phonons are only important in the calculation of the real part of @xmath213 , they play no role in the calculation of @xmath184 in the temperature range @xmath214 $ ] k. the self - energies due to mid - gap states and due to optical phonons are in a sense complementary , since the imaginary part coming from impurities is large at the dirac point , whereas the imaginary part coming from the optical phonons increase linearly with the energy away from the dirac point . the imaginary part of the self energy due to charged impurities is a non - monotonous function of the energy , growing first linearly but changing to a decaying behavior of the form @xmath215 , for large energies .    in section [ oc ]",
    ", we have discussed the different scattering mechanisms separately , since for suspended graphene coulomb scatterers will be absent . since vacancies ,",
    "corresponding to an infinite potential where particle - hole symmetry is restored , are unlikely , we model the short - ranged potentials due to cracks , ripples , etc . by large , but finite",
    "short ranged potential . for the dc conductivity , this leads to an asymmetry of the hole- and electron - doped regime .",
    "the most notable effect on the optical conductivity of both the optical phonons and the impurities is the induction of a finite energy absorption in the energy range @xmath200 , a region where the clean theory predicts a negligible absorption .",
    "the optical phonons also induce a conductivity larger than @xmath18 around @xmath216 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for frequencies away from the dirac point the imaginary part of the self - energy due to optical phonons is linear in frequency , a behavior similar to that due to electron - electron interactions in graphene .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ swfit ] that in general the calculated absorption in the range @xmath200 is not as large as the experimental one .",
    "it is also noticeable that for small gate voltages there is a reasonable fit of both the absorption and of the broadening of the of the step around @xmath20 .",
    "for large values of the gate voltage the calculated absorption is smaller than the measured one .",
    "this suggests that some additional scattering mechanism is missing in the calculation of the optical conductivity .",
    "the missing mechanism has to be more effective at large gate voltage .",
    "a possibility are plasmons of the type found in ref .",
    "another possibility is that water molecules which are especially active in the infrared regime , are contributing to the missing weight .    in synthesis",
    "we have provided a complete and self - consistent description of the optical conductivity of graphene on a substrate ( including coulomb scatterers ) and suspended ( without coulomb scatterers ) .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "to meet a quantitative agreement further research ( also on suspended graphene ) is necessary , but water molecules underneath the graphene sheet are likely to account for the missing weight .",
