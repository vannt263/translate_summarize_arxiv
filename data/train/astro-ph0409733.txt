    "the radio sky at @xmath2 is dominated by galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "it is believed to be produced by cosmic ray electrons propagating in the magnetic field of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the galactic synchrotron emission is an important foreground for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments @xcite . for the upcoming high redshift 21 cm tomography experiments @xcite , such as past @xcite , lofar , and ska",
    ", it poses a major challenge .    the global galactic synchrotron emission spectrum from 0.3 mhz to 408 mhz can be fit with a two component disk model of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "analysis of the existing radio surveys at 408 mhz , 1.42 ghz , and 2.326 ghz @xcite shows that the synchrotron emission has a spectral index @xmath3 @xcite , which is in general agreement with the cmb result @xcite .",
    "the real space distribution of synchrotron emissivity over the galactic disk , taking into account spiral arms , were derived from the 408 mhz whole sky map using refolding techniques @xcite . in the fourier space",
    ", the angular power spectrum of the galactic synchrotron radiation can be modeled reasonably well as a simple scaling relation : @xmath4 @xcite , with @xmath5 down to @xmath6 .",
    "recently , the wmap team obtained a shallower spectrum of @xmath7 down to @xmath8 .",
    "these are extrapolated to higher @xmath9 in recent studies of the 21 cm foreground @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we investigate the galactic synchrotron emission from a different perspective .",
    "we calculate the synchrotron angular power spectrum induced by the variation of the magnetic field and fluctuations in the cosmic ray electron density .",
    "our primary objective is to achieve a _ physical _ understanding of the origin of the synchrotron emission anisotropy . in particular",
    ", we would like to ask which of these two mechanisms is responsible in producing the observed anisotropy ?",
    "this will help us to assess the validity of the hypothesis adopted in the empirical analyses of cmb and 21 cm observation , e.g. , will the power law form of the angular power spectrum hold down to small scales relevant for the pre - reionization 21 cm observation ? at the same time , we may also gain useful knowledge about the galactic distribution of the cosmic ray electrons and the magnetic field .",
    "physical _ modeling have been performed for a number of other foregrounds , e.g. free - free @xcite and intergalactic shocks @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation power spectrum of the galactic magnetic field has been measured @xcite , and is consistent with being produced by a turbulent interstellar medium ( ism ) described by the komolgorov scaling model @xcite . with this",
    "we can calculate directly the anisotropy power spectrum induced by the magnetic field variation .",
    "the distribution of the cosmic ray electrons is less well known , but there is a broadly accepted picture of the cosmic electrons being produced in supernovae remnants ( snr ) , which then diffuses through the whole galaxy and be confined in a volume greater than the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "we can calculate the cosmic ray density distribution with this model .",
    "let us consider the angular power spectrum obtained over a small patch of `` blank '' sky field at high galactic latitude . in the optically thin case , the observed radiation intensity is simply an integral of the emissivity along the line of sight .",
    "at very low frequencies , synchrotron self - absorption and plasma absorption are important . for @xmath10 ,",
    "corresponding to the redshift range of 6 - 20 which is of interest to the study of the reionization process , these can be neglected , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the volume emissivity .",
    "the emissivity may have both spatial and frequency variations . if the two are separable , we may write @xmath13 where the tilde denotes fourier transform , @xmath14 .",
    "the emissivity power spectrum is then @xmath15 let us consider the case @xmath16 . at small scale",
    ", using the limber approximation @xcite , the angular power spectrum is given by @xmath17 if the emissivity has a power law spectrum , @xmath18 , then @xmath19 .",
    "the integral is up to some cutoff point , at which the emissivity drops to 0 .",
    "we now consider the emissivity of synchrotron radiation .",
    "if the energy distribution of cosmic ray electrons @xmath20 at each point is approxiamated as a simple power law with @xmath21 , then @xmath22 where @xmath23   \\gamma[\\frac{3p+19}{12}]$ ] .",
    "we see that for power law distribution with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "a power law is actually a good approximation to the real distribution function of cosmic ray electrons . in this approximation ,",
    "variation of emissivity can be induced by varying the magnetic field @xmath29 , spectral index @xmath30 , and cosmic ray electron density normalization @xmath31 . here",
    "we shall fix @xmath30 and consider the variation of @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "the galactic magnetic field is typically a few @xmath32 , for this magnetic field the emission at @xmath33 is produced primarily by cosmic electrons with @xmath34 .",
    "the local cosmic ray electron density can be measured directly .",
    "there is some uncertainty in the normalization , and corrections have to be made for solar modulation .",
    "a recent compilation of measurements yields @xcite , in our units , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , at the energy of a few gev .",
    "the spectral index @xmath37 yields @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . for comparison",
    ", the wmap measurement @xcite indicates that towards star forming regions , @xmath40 , and towards the halo , @xmath41 .",
    "radiative loss of electron energy provides a natural explanation to the steeping of the electron spectrum away from star - forming region . below 3 gev ,",
    "the electron spectrum becomes flatter , probably because the primary energy loss mechanism changes from radiation to ionization .",
    "the locally measured electron density may not represent the average , nevertheless we will use it as a trial value .",
    "we will take @xmath42 , which gives a slightly better fit to the radio data than the steep @xmath37 value .",
    "we also assume a disk scale height of 1 kpc ( corresponding to the thick disk in the @xcite model ) , and a smooth magnetic field of @xmath43 .",
    "with this set of parameters , the integrated sky brightness temperature at 408 mhz is 20 k , which reproduces the observed value at high galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "let us consider first the magnetic field with @xmath31 fixed .",
    "now @xmath44 if there is a large smooth global magnetic field component which varies only on large scale and fluctuations around it are small , then we can write @xmath45 , and @xmath46 then @xmath47    the interstellar medium is turbulent @xcite .",
    "komolgorov derived a scaling relation for scale - invariant turbulence @xcite , with a power spectrum of the form @xmath48 .",
    "the magnetic field fluctuation spectrum can be determined by energy equipartition .",
    "the predicted magnetic field fluctuation spectrum is confirmed on the scales of 0.01 pc  100 pc by observation of the faraday rotation of extragalactic sources @xcite . at larger scales and on the galactic disk ,",
    "the magnetic field spectrum is flatter , probably because at these scales the motion is dominated by by two - dimensional structure ( vortices ) .",
    "if we join the small scale and the large scale observations @xcite , we obtain @xmath49 this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bspec ] ( note that our definition of k differs from @xcite by a factor of @xmath50 ) .",
    "the energy is related to the power spectrum by @xmath51 other scaling models have also been suggested .",
    "for example , some mhd turbulence have @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "however , this would produce an angular power spectrum not very different from the komolgorov one .",
    "we can then carry out the calculation , with the magnetic field spectrum given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bspec ] ) and the locally measured electron density . however , even though we keep @xmath31 fixed to investigate the variation induced by the magnetic field , in reality it must decrease as we move away from the galactic disk . we can approximate this effect by taking the power spectrum @xmath54 also as an explicit function of @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the scale height of the halo in which the cosmic ray electrons are confined .",
    "it turns out that this damping factor only changes the result by a small factor , because the large @xmath55 contribution is already suppressed by the @xmath58 factor . for the small scale",
    "that we are mostly interested in , komolgorov spectrum applies , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the result of our calculation for @xmath61 ( 21 cm line at @xmath62 ) , and @xmath63 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] as solid lines , along with the wmap k band data ( centered at 23 ghz ) .",
    "remarkably , at small @xmath9 , the anisotropy power amplitude is of the same order of magnitude as the wmap data ( at such small @xmath9 , the limber approximation may not be very good , nevertheless the true result will be of the same order of magnitude ) .",
    "this means that the magnetic field fluctuation may play a role in the formation of the observed synchrotron anisotropy .",
    "however , it is clear that compared with the data @xmath64 drops too fast as @xmath9 increases .",
    "if the smooth magnetic field component is absent and the fluctuating field dominates , then @xmath65 where @xmath66/\\gamma[(2+p/2)]$ ] . in this case , the result is uncertain , because it depends on the higher order correlation @xmath67 .",
    "if we make the gaussian - like _ ansatz _ @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , then the result is @xmath70 . for the komolgorov spectrum @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which is extremely steep and can be neglected entirely . however , this assumption maybe incorrect .",
    "now we consider the variation of the cosmic ray electron density .",
    "this is not known from observation . to make an estimate of the fluctuation",
    ", we consider an injection - diffusion model @xcite , in which the cosmic ray electrons are produced ( injected ) in point sources , then diffuse out , until eventually losing all their energy or escaping the confinement volume .",
    "the density of electrons at a point in space is then dependent on the distance to nearby sources . neglecting the momentum space diffusion , the density normalization constant at position @xmath73 , time @xmath74 satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the cosmic ray electron injection rate at @xmath73 , and @xmath77 is the diffusion coefficient , which is constant below 5 gev , and @xmath78 at @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the last term in the equation represents loss of electrons by radiation , ionization , etc . , or by escaping the confinement volume , with @xmath80 the loss time scale . for radiative losses @xcite",
    ", @xmath81 we note that in the injection - diffusion model , the scale height of the cosmic ray halo is a few times of @xmath82 , with the above values we have @xmath83 .",
    "although very crude , our model is self - consistent . in fourier space , @xmath84 the steady state solution is @xmath85 the power spectrum is then @xmath86    supernovae remnants are most likely the primary source for these cosmic ray electrons .",
    "the injection function is then @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the number of cosmic ray electrons produced in one supernova , and @xmath89 is the number of supernovae explosions per unit volume per unit time . if the distribution of supernovae is poisson , with @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the volume in which one supernova explode per average interval @xmath92 , then @xmath93    when @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the average of @xmath31 . from this",
    "we obtain @xmath97 as a reality check , we take @xmath98 , a stellar disk with radius of 15 kpc , and a scale height of 300 pc , and also assume that in this volume the average interval of supernovae explosion is 50 years , then we find @xmath99 , which requires an energy of @xmath100 , which is a small fraction of the total energy of a supernova , hence supernovae do have sufficient energy to generate these cosmic ray electrons .    using this relation we finally obtain @xmath101",
    "note that when written in this form , the result does not depend on @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting @xmath64 is plotted as dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] . at large angle ,",
    "the predicted @xmath64 in this model is comparable to the case of magnetic field induced fluctuation , and agrees with what is observed at the order of the magnitude level .",
    "however , at large @xmath9 , @xmath102 , again the spectrum is too steep compared with observation .",
    "although the spectrum flattens at small @xmath103 , this happened only at scales comparable to the disk scale height , thus affecting only large angle ( @xmath104 a few ) .    in the above",
    "we have assumed a poisson distribution of supernovae remnant .",
    "if they are correlated , with @xmath105 , then @xmath106 . supernovae may well be correlated , as their rate should be proportional to the star formation rate , which in turn depends on the density .",
    "however , the komolgorov model of turbulence suggests @xmath107 .",
    "the observation of flocculent star light distribution in nearby spiral galaxies seem to confirm this expectation , which has a power law of @xmath108 at the 100 pc scale @xcite .",
    "if so , then the correlation of snr may not help us .",
    "however , more observations are needed to address this issue .",
    "we have calculated angular power spectrum of the galactic synchrotron radiation induced by the variation of the magnetic field and cosmic ray electron density .",
    "we found that at low @xmath9 , the amplitudes of the anisotropy power produced by both mechanisms are comparable to the observed value .",
    "this indicates that these physical mechanisms _ are _ relevant to the production of the observed foreground anisotropy .",
    "however , neither of these two mechanisms can produce the @xmath109 power spectrum observed by wmap @xcite , and are also steeper than the older value of @xmath110 .",
    "the magnetic field model induce power spectrum of the form @xmath60 , while for the electron density fluctuation it is @xmath102 if the spatial distribution of the snr is poisson .",
    "this may be remedied if the spatial distribution of supernova remnants has the form @xmath111 .",
    "however , observations seem to indicate @xmath112 .",
    "we made a number of simplifications in our calculation .",
    "we did not consider the detailed distribution of global magnetic field and cosmic ray sources in the galaxy , nor do we consider accelerations outside snr .",
    "it is unlikely that inclusion of any of these details would change our qualitative conclusion .",
    "perhaps more important is our assumption of a universal energy spectrum of the electrons . in reality",
    ", the spectral index varies from place to place , and this may induce additional anisotropy . to model",
    "this , we need to include momentum space diffusion .",
    "we plan to address these issues in subsequent studies .",
    "if the galactic synchrotron emission does have a steep angular power spectrum as suggested here , how could we reconcile this with the shallower power spectrum reported by the wmap team ?",
    "one intriguing possibility is that there may be another type of foreground , which has a frequency dependence similar to the synchrotron radiation at the relevant bands , and was mistaken as synchrotron radiation .",
    "recently , several groups of researchers have suggested that some of the foreground identified as synchrotron by the wmap team may actually be spinning dust @xcite .",
    "this has a peak at @xmath113 , which would not affect the 21 cm measurements .",
    "there might also be other foregrounds , e.g. of extragalactic origin , which contributes to the radio survey .",
    "alternatively , there may be other unknown mechanisms which produce the small scale anisotropy in the galactic synchrotron radiation .",
    "further investigations are needed to identify what is responsible for producing the small scale anisotropy power .",
    "for the two known physical mechanisms discussed here , the anisotropy power at small scales is much smaller than derived from simple extrapolation ."
