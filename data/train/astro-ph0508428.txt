    "there is good reason to believe that the central regions of gravitationally bound prestellar cores are somewhat cooler than their outer parts .",
    "this is implied by the recent far - infrared observations of starless cores ( ward - thompson , andr , & kirk @xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", dust radiative transfer calculations by zucconi , walmsley , & galli ( @xcite ) predict that there should be a positive radial dust temperature gradient , with values ranging from @xmath3  k at the core center to @xmath4  k at the core edge .",
    "since the temperature of the gas @xmath5 is coupled to that of the dust for gas densities @xmath6  @xmath7 ( see e.g. galli , walmsley , & gonalves @xcite ) , one may expect that the radial distribution of the gas temperature in dense prestellar cores is also characterized by a positive temperature gradient .",
    "this implies that an effective polytropic index @xmath8 of the gas may be less than unity , certainly during the prestellar phase .",
    "a positive temperature gradient in the prestellar phase , and continued non - isothermality of a protostellar envelope during the accretion phase may have important consequences for protostellar evolution .",
    "consider the distinct differences in self - similar solutions of spherical protostellar accretion .",
    "although the mass accretion rate @xmath0 onto a protostar is time - independent in isothermal similarity solutions ( shu @xcite ; hunter @xcite ) , the similarity solutions for gravitational collapse of polytropic spheres ( yahil @xcite ; suto & silk @xcite ) show that @xmath0 should increase with time if @xmath9 and decrease with time if @xmath10 . the numerical modeling of the collapse of polytropic spheres by ogino , tomisaka , & nakamura ( @xcite ) also shows this tendency .",
    "if the cooling in an envelope due to direct emission of photons or frequent gas - dust collisions is efficient enough to reduce the effective value of @xmath8 below unity , then the mass accretion rate @xmath0 on to the protostar is expected to increase with time .",
    "however , in this case , it is difficult to explain the observations of bontemps et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who have suggested that the mass accretion rate of class  i objects ( i.e. protostars in the late accretion stage ) falls off by an order of magnitude compared to that of class  0 objects ( i.e. protostars in the early accretion phase ) .",
    "one may then need to appeal to other effects that limit the mass infall , such as a finite mass reservoir ( see vorobyov & basu @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "conversely , the thermal balance of a protostellar envelope may be dominated by the compressional heating of matter rather than by radiative cooling of gas or dust - gas energy transfer .",
    "this could raise the effective value of @xmath8 above unity and perhaps lead to a declining @xmath0 . in this case , at least some of the inferred decline in @xmath0 during the accretion phase may be attributed to non - isothermal effects .    our motivation for this paper is to model the details of radiative cooling , cosmic - ray heating , and gas - dust energy transfer in a model of hydrodynamic collapse , in order to settle the above issues . in paper",
    "i , we studied spherical isothermal collapse and found that although an initially declining @xmath0 is present , due to the gradient of infall speed in the pre - stellar phase , the observational tracks of envelope mass @xmath11 versus bolometric luminosity @xmath12 could only be explained by the effect of an inwardly propagating rarefaction wave due to a finite mass reservoir .",
    "in fact , the class  i phase of protostellar evolution was identified with the period of rapidly declining @xmath0 occuring after the rarefaction wave reaches the protostar . here",
    ", we investigate whether non - isothermality can change this conclusion in any way . specifically , can non - isothermality explain any part ( or even all ) of the inferred drop in @xmath0 during the accretion phase ( bontemps et al .",
    "@xcite ) ?    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the numerical code used to model the gravitational collapse , as well as the initial and boundary conditions , are briefly discussed in   [ model ] .",
    "the temporal evolution of the mass accretion rate for an assumption of optically thin gas is studied in   [ thin ] .",
    "the influence of the radiative cooling saturation and the gas - dust energy transfer ( goldsmith @xcite ) on the mass accretion rate are investigated in ",
    "[ thick ] .",
    "our main results are summarized in ",
    "we consider the gravitational collapse of spherical non - isothermal clouds composed of molecular hydrogen with a @xmath13 admixture of atomic helium .",
    "the evolution is calculated by solving the hydrodynamic equations in spherical coordinates : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gas density , @xmath16 is the radial velocity , @xmath17 is the enclosed mass , @xmath18 is the internal energy density and @xmath19 is the gas pressure .",
    "we use the ratio of specific heats @xmath20 to link pressure and internal energy density and modify the energy equation for the effects of cooling and heating .",
    "the details of the radiative cooling rate @xmath21 , gas - dust energy transfer rate @xmath22 , and cosmic ray heating @xmath23 are given in ",
    "the gas dynamics of a collapsing cloud is followed by solving the usual set of hydrodynamic equations in spherical coordinates using the method of finite - differences with a time - explicit , operator split solution procedure similar to that of the zeus-1d numerical hydrodynamics code described in detail in stone & norman ( @xcite ) . because the time scales of cooling and heating are usually much shorter than the dynamical time , the energy equation update due to cooling and heating requires an implicit scheme .",
    "explicit schemes usually fail due to a strict limitation on the numerical time step set by the courant - friedrich - lvy condition .",
    "therefore , cooling and heating of gas are treated numerically using newton - raphson iterations , supplemented by a bisection algorithm for occasional zones where the newton - raphson method does not converge . in order to monitor accuracy ,",
    "the total change in the internal energy density in one time step is kept below @xmath24 .",
    "if this condition is not met , the time step is reduced and a solution is again sought . when the gas number density in the collapsing core exceeds @xmath25",
    "@xmath7 , we gradually reduce the cooling and heating so as to establish adiabatic evolution with @xmath26 for @xmath27  @xmath7 . this simplified treatment of the transition to an opaque protostar misses the details of the physics on small scales . specifically , a proper treatment of the accretion shock and radiative transfer effects is required to accurately predict the properties of the stellar core ( see winkler & newman @xcite for a detailed treatment and review of work in this area ) .",
    "however , our method should be adequate to study the protostellar accretion rate , and has been used successfully by e.g. foster & chevalier ( @xcite ) and ogino et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for this purpose .",
    "the numerical grid has 600 points which are initially uniformly spaced , but then move with the gas until the central core is formed .",
    "this provides an adequate resolution throughout the simulations .",
    "we impose boundary conditions such that the gravitationally bound cloud core has a constant mass and constant volume .",
    "the assumption of a constant mass appears to be observationally justified .",
    "for instance , the observations by bacmann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have shown that in at least some cases , such as l1544 in taurus , individual pre - stellar clouds are characterized by _ sharp edges _ defining typical outer radii @xmath28  pc , implying that these prestellar clouds represent _ finite reservoirs of mass _ for subsequent star formation .",
    "physically , this assumption may be justified if the core decouples from the rest of a comparatively static , diffuse cloud due to a shorter dynamical timescale in the gravitationally contracting central condensation than in the external region .",
    "a specific example of this , due to enhanced magnetic support in the outer envelope , is found in the models of ambipolar - diffusion induced core formation ( see , e.g. basu & mouschovias @xcite ) .",
    "the constant volume condition of a collapsing cloud core is mainly an assumption of a constant radius of gravitational influence of a subcloud within a larger parent diffuse cloud .",
    "the radial gas density distribution of a self - gravitating isothermal cloud that is in hydrostatic equilibrium can be conveniently approximated by a modified isothermal sphere , with gas density @xmath29 ( binney & tremaine @xcite ) , where @xmath30 is the central density and @xmath31 is the radial scale length .",
    "we choose a value @xmath32 , so that the inner profile is close to that of a bonnor - ebert sphere , @xmath33 is comparable to the jeans length , and the asymptotic density profile is twice the equilibrium singular isothermal sphere value @xmath34 ) .",
    "the latter is justified on the grounds that core formation should occur in a somewhat non - equilibrium manner ( an extreme case is the larson - penston flow , in which case the asymptotic density profile is as high as @xmath35 ) , and also by observations of protostellar envelope density profiles that are often overdense compared to @xmath36 ( andr , motte , & belloche @xcite ) .",
    "we also add a ( moderate ) positive density perturbation of a factor @xmath37 ( i.e. the initial gas density distribution is increased by a factor of 1.7 ) to drive the cloud ( especially the inner region which is otherwise near - equilibrium ) into gravitational collapse .",
    "for the purpose of comparison with isothermal simulations , we determine the size of the central flat region assuming a constant temperature @xmath38  k , which yields @xmath39  pc .",
    "the choice of central density @xmath30 , the size of the central flat region @xmath31 , the amplitude of density perturbation @xmath40 , and outer radius @xmath41 determines the cloud mass and the radial density distribution .",
    "the initial gas temperature distribution is then obtained by solving the equation of thermal balance @xmath42 .",
    "we study many different cloud masses - six models are presented in this paper .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the parameters for these model clouds .",
    "the adopted central number density @xmath43  @xmath7 is roughly an order of magnitude lower than is observed in prestellar cores ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "@xcite ) . considering that the observed cores may already be in the process of slow gravitational contraction , our choice of @xmath44 is justified for the purpose of describing the basic features of star formation . in all six models ,",
    "the outer radius @xmath41 is chosen so as to form gravitationally unstable prestellar cores with central - to - surface density ratio @xmath45 ( since our initial states are similar to bonnor - ebert spheres ) . in models",
    "ni1 , ni3 , and ni5 , @xmath46 and by implication @xmath47 , whereas in models  ni2 , ni4 , and ni6 @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "models  ni2 , ni4 , and ni6 thus represent very extended prestellar cores ; the ` ni ' stands for nonisothermal .",
    "0.1 cm    .[table1]model parameters [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     all densities are in units of @xmath50  @xmath7 , scales in pc , masses in @xmath51 , and temperatures in k. @xmath52 is the cloud mass , and @xmath53 is the dust temperature .",
    "in this section we study how the non - isothermality of gas can affect the temporal evolution of the mass accretion rate .",
    "our results should be interpreted in the context of models of one - dimensional radial infall .",
    "hence , our calculated mass accretion rates really represent the infall onto the inner protostellar disk that would be formed due to rotation .",
    "since disk masses are not observed to be greater than protostellar masses , it is likely that the protostellar accretion is at least proportional to the mass infall on to the disk .",
    "the mass accretion rate is computed at a radial distance 600  au=0.003  pc .",
    "we neglect heating due to the central source at this distance .",
    "first , we consider a simplified assumption of optically - thin gas heated only by the cosmic rays .",
    "we further take into account the saturation of the radiative cooling of gas at @xmath6  @xmath7 and the gas - dust energy transfer ( goldsmith @xcite ) .",
    "our optically thin model serves as an example limiting case that builds our intuition about the effect of temperature gradients in a cloud core and serves as a comparison to the more realistic cooling models presented in ",
    "[ thick ] . in this idealized limit",
    ", the radiative cooling of gas can be expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the radiative cooling rate in ergs  @xmath56  s@xmath57 and @xmath58 is the number density .",
    "for the temperature dependence of the radiative cooling rate @xmath55 we have implemented the cooling function of wada & norman ( @xcite ) ( their fig .",
    "1 ) for solar metallicity and gas temperature @xmath59  k. the cooling function simplifies the implementation of cooling by collecting the effects of various coolants .",
    "the cooling processes taken into account are : ( 1 ) vibrational and rotational excitation of @xmath60 ; ( 2 ) atomic and molecular cooling due to fine - structure emission of c and o ; ( 3 ) rotational line emission of co. we do not consider cooling due to c@xmath61 , since the complete conversion of c@xmath61 to co in cloud cores occurs when the number density rises beyond @xmath50  @xmath7 ( nelson & langer @xcite ) . moreover , this chemical change appears to have little effect on the dynamics of self - gravitating cloud cores .",
    "this is because the cooling rate of c@xmath61 is similar to that of co , particularly in the density - temperature region typical for the cloud cores ( nelson & langer @xcite ) .",
    "since we are interested in well - shielded regions , we can ignore the direct photoelectric heating of gas by the incident ultraviolet radiation .",
    "the cosmic - ray heating is thus the only process that heats the gas directly .",

    "an obvious difference is seen in the behaviour of @xmath0 of the non - isothermal clouds as compared to that of the isothermal ones : _ no peak in the mass accretion rate is seen at the time of the hydrostatic core formation _ ( @xmath67  myr ) .",
    "this is because the effect of progressively warmer layers falling onto the protostar cancels the effect of inner mass shells having greater initial infall speeds ; we discuss this effect again in   [ mdot ] .",
    "instead , @xmath0 of the non - isothermal clouds grows monotonically and appears to stabilize at @xmath68  yr@xmath57 if the size of the cloud is sufficiently large ( model  ni2 ) .",

    ", roughly half of the envelope mass has accreted on to the central hydrostatic core .",
    "calculations of thermal balance in dark , well - shielded molecular cores by goldsmith & langer ( @xcite ) and goldsmith ( @xcite ) have shown that the cooling from main coolants such as co , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , c , and others , is proportional to @xmath76 only at low densities of molecular hydrogen , i.e. @xmath77  @xmath7 . at @xmath78  @xmath7 ,",
    "the cooling from these species saturate ( see e.g. goldsmith @xcite ) .",

    "noticeable exceptions are the cooling from @xmath79 and cs , which do not saturate even at densities @xmath80  @xmath7 due to a sufficiently large spontaneous decay rate .",

    "if the dust temperature is sufficiently low ( @xmath1  k ) , which roughly corresponds to the gravitationally bounded subcloud being deeply embedded within a parent diffuse ( i.e. non - gravitating ) molecular cloud and heavily shielded from the interstellar radiation field ( @xmath138 ) , the gas behaves as being effectively optically thin due to efficient cooling by dust .",
    "specifically , no well - developed peak in @xmath0 is observed shortly after the formation of the hydrostatic core , and the temporal evolution of the mass accretion rate is qualitatively similar to that considered in the optically thin case .",
    "the absence of the peak is due to the positive temperature gradient developing in the cloud s innermost regions before and shortly after the formation of the hydrostatic core .",
    "this positive temperature gradient effectively increases the mass accretion rate with time and appears to compensate its decrease due to the non - uniform radial gas velocity profile . in the opposite case of a subcloud being",
    "only moderately shielded from the interstellar radiation field with @xmath139 and @xmath2  k , the temporal evolution of the mass accretion rate is qualitatively similar to that of the isothermal ( @xmath66  k ) cloud .",
    "irrespective of the effects of radiative cooling and dust temperature , the later evolution of the mass accretion rate , after roughly half of the envelope has accreted onto the hydrostatic core , is characterized by a fast decline due to a rarefaction wave associated with the finite mass reservoir . in paper",
    "i , we associated this phase ( which has a temporally declining bolometric luminosity @xmath12 ) with the empirically defined class i phase of protostellar evolution .",
    "the inclusion of non - isothermal effects in this paper does not change this conclusion .",
    "we have shown that the initial decline in @xmath0 is weakened or may even be absent in a model with a realistic treatment of cooling .",
    "therefore , the ultimate decline in @xmath0 due to the finite mass reservoir is even more necessary to explain the class i phase .",
    "our simulations also demonstrate that the evolution of pre - stellar cores down to the late protostellar stage can not be described by a polytropic law with a fixed index @xmath140 . instead , before and shortly after the formation of the hydrostatic core , the local polytropic index @xmath8 in the inner envelope @xmath124  pc is below unity and @xmath141 , mainly due to effective cooling by the dust .",
    "however , in the post - core - formation epoch , the gas is virtually in a free - fall near the central hydrostatic core and the compressional heating overtakes other energetic processes . as a consequence ,",
    "the flow becomes nearly adiabatic with @xmath127 and the gas in the accreting envelope attains a negative temperature gradient .",

    "<S> our results show that : ( 1 ) in the idealized limit of optically thin cooling , a positive temperature gradient is present in the prestellar phase which effectively cancels out the effect of the velocity gradient , producing a near constant ( weakly increasing with time ) @xmath0 in the early accretion phase ; ( 2 ) in the more realistic case including cooling saturation at higher densities , @xmath0 may initially be either weakly increasing or weakly decreasing with time , for low dust temperature ( @xmath1 k ) and high dust temperature ( @xmath2 k ) cases , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our results show that the initial decline in @xmath0 seen in isothermal models is definitely not enhanced by non - isothermal effects , and is often suppressed by them . in all our models , @xmath0 does eventually decline rapidly due to the finite mass condition on our cores and a resulting inward propagating rarefaction wave . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any explanation for a rapid decline of @xmath0 in the accretion phase likely needs to appeal to the global molecular cloud structure and possible envelope support , which results in a finite mass reservoir for cores .    </S>",
