    "the knowledge of the non - perturbative properties of heavy hadrons such as their binding energies or their weak transition matrix elements are of fundamental importance for the determination of the fundamental parameters of the standard model . among these are the quark masses and the values of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements .",
    "a convenient access to the properties of heavy hadrons containing one heavy quark is given by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) which provides a systematic power series expansion of physical matrix elements involving heavy hadrons in terms of the inverse of the heavy quark mass ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "while the case of heavy meson systems has been analyzed in great detail , corresponding calculations for heavy baryon systems have been lagging behind .",
    "this is unfortunate since results from the analysis of heavy baryon systems are expected to provide important supplementary information on the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd and on the fundamental parameters of the standard model .",
    "the importance of further theoretical studies on heavy baryon systems is highlighted by the fact that there is now an abundance of new experimental data on heavy baryon decays sparked by recent advances in microvertexing techniques .",
    "this data needs to be analyzed and interpreted theoretically .",
    "a convenient and well - trusted tool to investigate the non - perturbative properties of heavy hadrons is the qcd sum rule method  @xcite .",
    "the first application of the qcd sum rule method to heavy baryons was considered some time ago by shuryak  @xcite who studied heavy baryons in the static limit given by the leading term in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "the work of shuryak  @xcite was revised and extended in  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of heavy baryons containing large but finite quark masses @xmath6 was undertaken in  @xcite .",
    "we have recently been embarking on a program to improve on previous analysis of heavy baryon sum rules by including first order radiative corrections in the analysis . in  @xcite we determined the two - loop anomalous dimensions of the static heavy baryon currents . in  @xcite we determined the perturbative @xmath1 corrections to the leading , dimension zero , term in the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the static heavy baryon current correlator .",
    "similar to the heavy meson case investigated e.g.   in  @xcite the radiative corrections to the perturbative dimension zero term are quite large .",
    "the results of  @xcite were used to construct and analyze so - called diagonal qcd sum rules for heavy baryons  @xcite .",
    "here the term `` diagonal '' refers to a particular feature of heavy baryon currents and their current products . for every baryonic state",
    "there are two independent interpolating currents even in the static limit  @xcite .",
    "one can thus construct diagonal sum rules from current correlators of the same baryon current and non - diagonal sum rules from current correlators of different baryon currents .",
    "the structure of the sum rules for the two cases is qualitatively quite different .",
    "nevertheless , they must be considered on the same footing . in",
    "@xcite we provided a detailed analysis of the diagonal sum rules .",
    "the main part of the present paper is devoted to an analysis of the non - diagonal sum rules including radiative corrections .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained from the analysis of the diagonal sum rules . using results from  @xcite",
    "we also analyze mixed sum rules where we use constituent type current combinations in the current correlators .    in order to provide a brief synapsis of the structural differences of the diagonal and non - diagonal sum rules let us briefly recapitulate the main features of the diagonal sum rule analysis  @xcite :    * qcd sum rules based on diagonal correlators feature a leading order spectral density which grows rapidly with energy as @xmath7 .",
    "this rapid growth introduces a strong dependence of the results on the assumed value of the continuum threshold . * the qcd radiative correction to the leading order spectral density amounts to about @xmath8 at the renormalization scale @xmath9 . * despite of the large qcd corrections to the wilson coefficients in the ope , the lowest order sum rules and the radiatively corrected sum rules predict nearly the same values for the masses and the residues , while the stability region of the sum rule results appears at slightly shifted values of the continuum threshold .",
    "it is clear that one also needs to analyze the non - diagonal sum rules in addition to the diagonal sum rules if only for reasons of consistency .",
    "a welcome property of the non - diagonal correlator is the quite `` normal '' behaviour @xmath10 of the spectral density and the fact that the qcd corrections are moderate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we introduce our notation and construct the correlator of two heavy baryon currents .",
    "we also recall the form of the known qcd corrections to the dimension zero term of the ope . in sect .",
    "3 we present our results on the qcd corrections to the dimension three contribution in the ope , which is proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the product of the quark and the antiquark field .",
    "we also construct generalized qcd sum rules which incorporate both the diagonal and the non - diagonal case .",
    "4 contains the results of our numerical analysis , our final numbers and a discussion of the results . in an appendix",
    "we collect our results on the evaluation of the radiative two - loop corrections to the dimension - three condensate contribution .",
    "the results are given for @xmath11-dimensional space - time using the most general baryon current structure .",
    "in this section we briefly recapitulate the basic notions involved in the construction of qcd sum rules for heavy baryons .",
    "this also serves to introduce our notation which closely follows the one used in  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is given by the correlator of two baryonic currents ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the residual momentum of the heavy quark and @xmath15 is the four - velocity of the heavy baryon , the product of both being denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "the residual momentum and the four - velocity are related by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the momentum of the heavy quark and @xmath6 is its mass . as was mentioned before , there are two possible choices of interpolating currents for each of the heavy baryon states .",
    "neglecting the flavour and colour structure for the moment , these are given by and @xmath19 can carry lorentz indices . a contraction on the lorentz indices",
    "is always implied when writing the currents in the form of eq .",
    "( [ currents ] ) ] @xmath20\\gamma'q\\qquad\\mbox{and}\\qquad j_2=[q^{t}c\\gamma_2q]\\gamma^{'}q,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 to be more precise , it is clear that the multiplication of the light - side dirac structure @xmath22 with @xmath23 does not change the quantum numbers of the interpolating current but does change the structure of the current . multiplying the heavy - side structure",
    "@xmath19 with @xmath23 , however , does not change the structure of the interpolating current since @xmath24 in the static limit .    in the static limit one has two types of heavy ground state baryons depending on whether the light diquark system is in a spin  @xmath25 or in a spin  @xmath26 state .",
    "we shall employ a generic notation and refer to the first type ( spin  @xmath25 diquark ) as @xmath27-type heavy baryons .",
    "the dirac structure of the interpolating current is given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 in this case .",
    "in the second case ( spin  @xmath26 diquark ) one has a doublet of degenerate @xmath30-type states with overall spin  @xmath31 and  @xmath32 . for the spin  @xmath31 @xmath30-type state the interpolating current is given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the explicit form of the spin  @xmath32 interpolating current ( @xmath35-type state ) can be found e.g.   in  @xcite .    for a general analysis it proves convenient to represent the general light - side dirac structure of the currents in eq .",

    "( [ currents ] ) one encounters @xmath38-contractions of the form @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41-contraction leads to an @xmath36-dependence according to @xmath42 where @xmath11 denotes the space - time dimension .",
    "the @xmath23-contraction depends in addition on the parameter @xmath43 which takes the value ( @xmath44 ) and ( @xmath45 ) for an even or odd number of @xmath23 s in @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "finally we want to compare our results for the bound state energy with the existing experimental values for the baryon masses .",
    "for such a comparision we need to know the pole mass of the heavy quarks which can be extracted from the heavy quarkonium and heavy - light mesons  @xcite .",
    "the quoted value of the bottom quark pole mass varies from @xmath49  @xcite and @xmath50  @xcite to @xmath51  @xcite . assuming the range @xmath52 , the mass @xmath53 of the baryon @xmath54",
    "@xcite results in a range @xmath55 for the bound state energy .",
    "our central value @xmath56 for the bound state energy suggests a pole mass of @xmath57 for the bottom quark .    taking the experimental results for charm - quark baryons , namely @xmath58 and @xmath59  @xcite , our central values @xmath56 and @xmath60 predict a mean pole mass of @xmath61 for the charm quark .",
    "we have considered the operator product expansion of the correlator of two static heavy baryon currents at small euclidian distances and determined the @xmath1 radiative corrections to the first and second wilson coefficient in the expansion .",
    "based on the operator product expansion we have formulated and analyzed heavy baryon sum rules for the @xmath27-type and @xmath30-type heavy baryons using two different types of interpolating fields for the baryons in each case . in this paper",
    "we have constructed and analyzed the non - diagonal sum rules built from the correlators of two different currents including radiative corrections .",
    "the non - diagonal sum rules bring in some new features such as a more `` normal '' behaviour of the spectral density @xmath62 and moderate qcd corrections to the spectral density as compared to the diagonal case .",
    "we have taken a second look at the diagonal sum rules .",
    "we have also set up and analyzed constituent type heavy baryon sum rules where we have used interpolating currents that are expected to have a maximum overlap with the heavy baryon s light diquark system in the constituent quark model picture .",
    "all the three types of sum rules show acceptable stability in their dependence on the borel parameter , where the best stability was obtained for the diagonal sum rules .",
    "the results of the three types of sum rules ( diagonal , non - diagonal , constituent type ) on the bound state energy an the residues of the heavy ground state baryons were found to be consistent with each other , where the values obtained for the @xmath30-type baryons are more reliable than the results for the @xmath27-type baryons .",
