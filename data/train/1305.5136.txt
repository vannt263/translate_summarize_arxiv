    "complex networks of real - world systems commonly reveal groups of nodes with characteristic connection pattern  @xcite ( e.g. , densely connected groups known as communities  @xcite ) . these correspond to people with common interests in social networks  @xcite or classes with the same information signature in software networks  @xcite .",
    "characteristic groups of nodes provide an important insight into the structure and function of real - world networks  @xcite , while group detection also has numerous practical applications , including epidemic outbreak prevention  @xcite , viral marketing  @xcite , software package prediction  @xcite and compression  @xcite .    despite an outburst of community detection algorithms in the last decade  @xcite ,",
    "approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited ( e.g. , demand some apriori knowledge about the network structure ) .",
    "thus , we here propose a general group detection algorithm based on the label propagation framework in  @xcite that requires no apriori knowledge .",
    "analysis in the paper confirms that the proposed algorithm is at least comparable to the current state - of - the - art , while its complexity is near ideal .",
    "the main novelty of the paper is else a simple hierarchical refinement procedure that enables straightforward discovery of different types of groups .",
    "the paper also includes a detailed empirical comparison of a larger number of state - of - the - art approaches for group detection that may be of an independent interest .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , section  [ sec : background ] gives preliminary discussion on groups of nodes in real - world networks .",
    "next , we introduce the group detection algorithm proposed in the paper in  section  [ sec : algorithm ] . rigorous analysis on synthetic and real - world network appears in  section  [ sec : analysis ] , whereas detailed comparison with the state - of - the - art on group detection , hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks is presented in  section  [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper and gives some prominent directions for future work .",
    "let the network be represented by a simple undirected graph @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a set of nodes in the network , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the set of links , @xmath4 .",
    "next , let @xmath5 be the set of neighbors of node @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 the number of links between the nodes in @xmath5 .",
    "last , let @xmath9 be the degree of @xmath6 , @xmath10 , and let @xmath11 be the average degree in the network .      the present paper is concerned with groups of nodes with characteristic connection pattern that appear in complex real - world networks  @xcite . while these could be defined in various ways , we adopt two types of groups that have been most popular in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "first , we consider communities  @xcite ( also link - density community  @xcite ) that , e.g. , represent groups of people with common interests in social networks  @xcite .",
    "community is defined as a ( connected ) group of nodes with more links towards the nodes in the group than to the rest of the network  @xcite .",
    "second , we consider sparse modules  @xcite ( also link - pattern community  @xcite and other  @xcite ) that in , e.g. , software networks correspond to classes with the same function  @xcite . module is defined as a ( possibly ) disconnected group of nodes with more links towards common neighbors than to the rest of the network  @xcite",
    ".    definition of a module is rather similar to the concept of structural or regular equivalence  @xcite ( i.e. , blockmodels ) , although not equivalent .",
    "note that communities can in fact be considered under the definition of modules ( most authors have indeed adopted this stance  @xcite ) , however , there exist important differences between the two  @xcite ( e.g. , connectedness ) .",
    "based on the above , a group detection approach could gain from differentiating between communities and modules .",
    "note that the definition of a community implies locally dense structure , while no such tendency appears in the definition of a module .",
    "density of node s neighborhood is usually measured by the node clustering coefficient @xmath12  @xcite defined  as @xmath13 while @xmath14 is the network clustering coefficient  @xcite .",
    "however , denominator in  eq .",
    "( [ equ : clustering ] ) introduces biases into the definition of clustering , since @xmath15 often can not be reached due to fixed degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "the latter is particularly apparent in degree disassortative networks  @xcite , which most real - world networks in fact are .",
    "thus , an alternative definition denoted degree - corrected clustering coefficient @xmath16  @xcite has been proposed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the maximum possible number of links among  @xmath5 and @xmath19 .    thus , in the presence of communities , one can expect dense network structure with @xmath20 . on the other hand , different configurations of modules ( e.g. , bipartite , multi - partite or star - like structures )",
    "imply sparser networks with @xmath21 .",
    "for example , most prominent modules are found in two - mode networks , where @xmath22 .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that a module structure does not necessarily mean @xmath22 , since a tripartite configuration of modules obviously has @xmath23 .",
    "the proposed algorithm for group detection is based on the label propagation framework  @xcite that we introduce next . due to simplicity",
    ", the framework is presented for the case of simple undirected graphs , although a generalization to weighted multigraphs is straightforward",
    ".      let @xmath24 be an unknown group label of node @xmath6 and let @xmath25 a group of nodes with label @xmath24 . propagating labels between the nodes was first proposed for community detection  @xcite .",
    "initially , each node is labeled with a unique label as @xmath26 ( i.e. , put in a separate group @xmath25 ) .",
    "then , at each iteration of the algorithm , each node adopts the label shared by most of its neighbors ( ties are broken uniformly at random ) .",
    "hence , @xmath27 where @xmath5 is the set of neighbors of node @xmath6 and the @xmath28 is a kronecker delta . due to the presence of numerous links within the communities , relative to the number of links towards the rest of the network , nodes in communities form a consensus on some label @xmath29 after only a few iterations .",
    "thus , when the process converges , disconnected groups @xmath30 are classified as communities . due to very fast structural inference of label propagation ,",
    "the algorithm exhibits near linear complexity , while the expected number of iterations on a network with a billion links is only @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the approach can be significantly improved by adopting also node preferences  @xcite .",
    "preferences adjust the propagation strength of the nodes and force the label propagation process towards a desirable group partition @xmath30 .",
    "let  @xmath32 and @xmath33 be the preferences of node @xmath6  @xcite ( see below ) . then , eq .",
    "( [ equ : lpa ] ) is rewritten to @xmath34 preferences @xmath35 correspond to defensive label propagation  @xcite that increases the propagation strength from the core of each group or , equivalently , decreases the strength of its border .",
    "this forces the algorithm to more gradually reveal the underlying structure and improves group detection in real - world networks  @xcite .",

    "( [ equ : dpa ] ) occur sequentially , in a random order , to avoid label oscillations in , e.g. , bipartite or star - like graphs .",
    "still , this severely hampers the stability of the approach  @xcite , since nodes that are updated at the beginning of some iteration gain higher propagation strength than those that are considered last .",
    "balancers @xmath36  @xcite decrease ( increase ) the strength of the nodes that are considered first ( last ) , which counteracts for the introduced randomness and stabilizes the algorithm .",
    "let @xmath37 $ ] be a normalized index of node @xmath6 in some random order .",
    "assuming linearity , we can model node balancers simply as @xmath38 , however , the use of a sigmoid curve allows for some further control  @xcite ( see  alg .",
    "[ alg : gpa ] , line  7 ) .",
    "the latter in fact introduces parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath39 is fixed to @xmath41  @xcite , while @xmath42 represents the balance between the algorithm stability and complexity ( see  section  [ sec : analysis ] ) .    as label propagation in  eq .",
    "( [ equ : dpa ] ) can discover only densely connected groups of nodes , it is limited to communities .",
    "nevertheless , the same principle can be extended to modules of nodes  @xcite . rather than propagating the labels between the neighboring nodes ,",
    "labels are propagated between the nodes at distance two ( i.e. , through common neighbors ) .",
    "since nodes in modules share many neighbors , similarly as before , they form a consensus on some particular label @xmath29 . thus",
