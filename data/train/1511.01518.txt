    "an understanding of density fluctuations in bulk water and at interfaces , has played a central role in the description of hydrophobic effects  @xcite , which drive biomolecular  @xcite and other aqueous assemblies  @xcite .",
    "for example , the fact that @xmath0 , the probability of observing @xmath1 water molecules in a small observation volume ( @xmath2  nm@xmath3 ) , obeys gaussian statistics  @xcite , has provided molecular - level insights into the the pressure - induced denaturation of proteins  @xcite , as well as the convergence of protein unfolding entropies at a particular temperature  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the lum  chandler  weeks ( lcw ) theory  @xcite prediction that @xmath0 should develop fat low-@xmath1 tails for large volumes ( @xmath4  nm@xmath3 ) in bulk water , and near hydrophobic surfaces  @xcite , and its verification by simulations  @xcite , has clarified that water near hydrophobic surfaces is sensitive to perturbations  @xcite , and led to the insight that extended hydrophobic surfaces could generically serve as catalysts for the assembly and disassembly of small hydrophobic solutes  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the fact that low-@xmath1 fluctuations are enhanced near hydrophobic surfaces , also makes them a suitable metric for quantifying the hydrophobicity of a surface , or the strength of its interactions with water  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations are particularly useful in characterizing the hydrophobicity of complex surfaces with molecular - level heterogeneities , wherein conventional macroscopic measures , such as the water droplet contact angle , break down  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the rugged , heterogenous surfaces of proteins , hydrophobicity depends not only on the chemistry of the underlying residues  @xcite , but also on the particular topography  @xcite and chemical pattern  @xcite presented by the protein , and can depend non - trivially on the specific combination of the two  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations have previously been used to characterize the hydrophobicity of such complex surfaces using small ( e.g. , methane - sized ) @xmath5  @xcite , wherein the fluctuations of interest can be estimated using equilibrium molecular simulations  @xcite . however , the likelihood of low-@xmath1 fluctuations decreases roughly exponentially with the size of @xmath5 , and estimating @xmath6 for larger @xmath5 requires computationally expensive biased sampling techniques , such as umbrella sampling  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the larger the volume of interest , the larger the number of biased simulations required . as a result , using large volumes , such as the hydration shells of entire proteins , to characterize surface hydrophobicity would be very expensive .",
    "further , using umbrella sampling in conjunction with more computationally expensive treatments , which incorporate the polarizability of interfacial waters or electronic structure effects  @xcite , to characterize density fluctuations in large volumes , would also be prohibitively expensive .    here",
    "we present a method that enables estimation of @xmath6 at a number of sparsely separated @xmath1-values , albeit with a roughly two orders of magnitude increase in computational efficiency , as compared with conventional techniques , such as umbrella sampling or free energy perturbation . to facilitate sparse sampling ,",
    "we employ thermodynamic integration to estimate free energy differences between biased ensembles , thereby circumventing the umbrella sampling requirement that adjacent biased distributions overlap .",
    "building upon recent work by patel and garde  @xcite , we employ a linear biasing potential , which enables efficient estimation of free energy differences between biased ensembles using averages that converge rapidly and require only short simulations . in the following section , we first derive the central equations underlying our method , followed by details pertaining to the systems studied and the simulations employed . in the subsequent section , we demonstrate how the method works using a small volume in bulk water .",
    "we then apply the method to characterize the hydrophobicity of interfaces ; first , uniform self - assembled monolayer surfaces , and then the entire hydration shell of the protein , ubiquitin .",
    "we then discuss the underpinnings of the method s efficiency and its limitations , and conclude with a discussion of scenarios where the method may find broader applicability .",

    "we will focus on quantifying the closely related probability , @xmath12 , of observing @xmath13 coarse - grained water molecules in @xmath5 .",
    "the operator , @xmath14 , is chosen to be strongly correlated with the ( discrete ) operator , @xmath10 , but is a continuous function of @xmath11 , so that @xmath15-dependent biasing potentials do not give rise to impulsive forces in md simulations .",
    "the functional forms that we employ for @xmath14 , can be found in ref .   .",
    "importantly , as shown in the supporting information , in addition to enabling sparse sampling of @xmath16 , the method we present below , can also be used to obtain @xmath6 . to estimate @xmath16 over the entire range of @xmath13-values , including those that are highly improbable",
    ", standard approaches such as umbrella sampling , prescribe the application of a biasing potential that is a function of @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "consider the biasing potential , @xmath17 , parametrized by @xmath18 , so that the hamiltonian of the biased system becomes @xmath19 ; let @xmath20 be the partition function associated with @xmath21",

    "taking the logarithm of both sides and defining the free energy , @xmath28 , of observing @xmath13 coarse - grained waters in @xmath5 , through @xmath29 , we get the standard result that serves as a starting point for analyzing umbrella sampling results  @xcite , @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is similarly defined as @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the free energy difference between the biased and unbiased ensembles .",
    "the first term in equation  [ eq : us2 ] can be readily estimated from biased simulations , and the second term is trivial to evaluate , because the functional form of the biasing potential is known .",
    "in contrast , the third term , @xmath34 , is not known a priori ; umbrella sampling relies on overlap in adjacent biased distributions to estimate @xmath34 , usually with the help of algorithms such as wham or mbar  @xcite .",
    "such a prescription provides accurate estimates of @xmath28 over the entire range of sampled @xmath15-values .",
    "nevertheless , obtaining a continuous @xmath28 distribution is not always necessary ; instead , a knowledge of its functional form at @xmath13-values that are well separated can often be sufficient .",
    "however , the umbrella sampling requirement of overlap between adjacent biased distributions is incommensurate with the spirit of such sparse sampling .",
    "importantly , the overlap requirement also necessitates a large number of biased simulations , and can be computationally expensive , in particular for large @xmath5 .",
    "the proposed method aims to circumvent this overlap requirement by estimating @xmath34 using thermodynamic integration .",
    "we will demonstrate that such an approach can be both accurate and highly efficient for a particular choice of the biasing potential , @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we build upon recent work by patel and garde  @xcite , which employed a linear biasing potential to estimate the free energy of emptying @xmath5 , as quantified by @xmath35 , with a roughly 2 orders of magnitude decrease in computational effort . here",
    "we show how the entire @xmath22 distribution can be sparsely sampled with a similar increase in computational efficiency , through the use of such a linear potential , @xmath36 , whose strength is determined by the parameter , @xmath18 . in the presence of the linear potential , @xmath37 , equation  [ eq : us2 ] becomes @xmath38 as discussed above , the first two terms of the above equation are readily determined . here",
    "we determine @xmath34 using thermodynamic integration , that is , by integrating @xmath39 as : @xmath40 the integration is performed over a range of @xmath18-values from zero ( i.e. , the unbiased system ) to the particular @xmath18-ensemble of interest .",
    "increasing @xmath18 penalizes the presence of water molecules in @xmath5 ; indeed , because @xmath41 , @xmath42 decreases monotonically as @xmath18 is increased . to illustrate how the method works ,",
    "consider employing equation  [ eq : us - phi ] for @xmath43 , @xmath44 thus , from estimates of the average values , @xmath45 , obtained from a series of biased simulations with potentials of strength , @xmath46 , the corresponding estimates of @xmath47 can be readily obtained at @xmath48 distinct @xmath13-values .",
    "in addition to @xmath47 , this method can also be used to obtain estimates of @xmath28 in the vicinity of @xmath49 ; in particular , using equations  [ eq : us - phi ] and  [ eq : fphi ] , @xmath28 can be estimated for each @xmath13-value sampled by any of the biased simulations .",
    "we note that while we have chosen to focus on the fluctuations in @xmath15 , the method presented here can readily be generalized to chararcterize fluctuations in any order parameter .",
    "further , as mentioned above and shown in the supporting information , this approach can also be used to indirectly sample discrete order parameters ; in particular , @xmath6 , the probability of observing @xmath1 water molecules in @xmath5 , can be readily estimated .",
    "finally , we note that while there are certain similarities between our method and the umbrella integration ( ui ) method , proposed by kstner and thiel  @xcite , there are important fundamental and practical differences between the two methods ; a detailed discussion of these issues is included in the supplementary information .",

    "the low-@xmath13 behavior of @xmath71 serves to characterize the hydrophobicity of complex surfaces with nanoscale heterogeneities , such as those presented by proteins ; here , we use the method to characterize @xmath71 in a large volume , constituting the entire hydration shell of the protein , ubiquitin .",
    "such a characterization of protein hydration shells not only provides an overall measure of protein hydrophobicity , but also quantifies the free energy required to displace water molecules from the protein hydration shell , which could inform its propensity to bind hydrophobic ligands  @xcite .",
    "in addition to facilitating characterization of @xmath71 in large volumes , the efficiency of our method may also enable estimation of @xmath71 , using more detailed treatments of water in the bulk or at interfaces , which are inherently expensive form a computational standpoint .",
    "such treatments include force fields that explicitly account for molecular polarizability  @xcite , or ab initio molecular dynamics simulations , which incorporate electronic structure effects  @xcite .",
    "the method presented here is fairly general , and can be readily generalized to other order parameters besides @xmath15 as well as to higher dimensions .",
    "a straightforward generalization of the method could facilitate characterization of the free energetics of concentrations ( as opposed to number density ) fluctuations in multi - component aqueous solutions and mixtures  @xcite .",
    "biasing potentials that couple linearly to an order parameter of interest are also employed in a variety of other contexts ; examples include constant electrostatic potential simulations used to study charge fluctuations in capacitors  @xcite , simulations that bias trajectory space using a dynamical order parameters such as activity  @xcite , and alchemical methods for estimating binding free energies  @xcite .",
    "while free energy perturbation is typically employed in alchemical calculations to estimate the free energy differences between the ensembles of interest , the method introduced here could additionally provide the statistics of the energy differences between those ensembles ; an understanding of such statistics may further inform optimal strategies for accurately and efficiently estimating the corresponding free energies . such an understanding may also lead to the development of analytical expressions for the estimation of free energies . due to the dramatic increase in computational efficiency that the method provides",
    ", we believe that it will also be well - suited for the characterization of free energies in multiple dimensions , wherein ensuring overlap in all order parameters becomes very expensive , and increases exponentially with the number of dimensions .",
    "in particular , the method may find use in the characterization of two - dimensional free energetic landscapes that serve as a starting point for recent spatial coarse - graining schemes  @xcite .",

    "employing a straightforward reweighting strategy , we get @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the partition function of the biased ensemble . finally , recognizing that the delta function allows us to pull the @xmath87 term outside the integral , we get @xmath88 taking the logarithm of both sides and recognizing that @xmath89 is simply the probability , @xmath23 , of observing @xmath13 coarse - grained waters in @xmath5 in the biased ensemble",

    "we show that using the same framework , a closely related discrete order parameter , such as the number of waters in @xmath5 , can also be sparse sampled , that is , the probability distribution , @xmath0 , of observing @xmath1 waters in @xmath5 can also be estimated . as in the previous section , the joint probability distribution , @xmath91 , of observing @xmath1 waters and @xmath13 corse - grained waters in the unbiased ensemble",
    "is given by : @xmath92 the central idea is to bias the system using the coarse - grained order parameter , @xmath13 , but collect both @xmath13 and @xmath1 data from the biased simulations to obtain @xmath93 , the biased joint distribution , which is the first term on the right side of equation  [ eq : jpvn - ln ] . the biasing potential ( the second term ) is known analytically and the free energy differences ( the third term ) between biased and unbiased ensemble can be readily estimated using thermodynamic integration , as discussed in the main text .",
    "finally , @xmath6 can be estimated by an integrating the unbiased joint distribution over @xmath13 , @xmath94 to illustrate equation  [ eq : jpvn - ln ] and equation  [ eq : jpvn - int ] , we apply this strategy to the hydration shell of the protein , ubiquitin , which was discussed in the main text .",
    "an example of the biased and corresponding unbiased joint distributions at an @xmath1-value ( in this case , @xmath95 with @xmath96 ) of interest , are shown in figures  [ fig : pvn]a and  [ fig : pvn]b respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : pvn]c shows that the sparse sampled free energies , @xmath97 , obtained from equation  [ eq : jpvn - int ] , agree well with the exact result computed by the indirect umbrella sampling method  @xcite .     for ubiquitin hydration shell .",
    "( a ) the @xmath98 biased simulation was used to estimate the biased joint distribution , @xmath91 , at @xmath95 .",
    "( b ) the corresponding unbiased joint distribution was obtained using equation  [ eq : jpvn - ln ] .",
    "( c ) each biased simulation was used to sparsely sample @xmath99 by integrating the respective unbiased joint distributions using equation  [ eq : jpvn - int ] ; the integral of the joint distribution from the @xmath100 ensemble is shown in purple . the resulting @xmath99 agrees well with the exact results obtained using the indirect umbrella sampling method  @xcite . ,",

    ". + 1 ) while we explicitly estimate the free energy differences between the biased and unbiased ensembles using thermodynamic integration , ui prescribes eliminating them from the analysis altogether by differentiating equation 2 of the main text .",
    "@xmath101-values are then estimated using biased simulations , and integrated numerically to yield estimates of @xmath102 .",
    "+ 2 ) the authors focus on the widely - used harmonic form of the biasing potential , and show that in the limiting case of a stiff spring , ui becomes equivalent to thermodynamic integration .",
    "in contrast , we use a linear biasing potential , which contributes significantly to the efficiency of our method ; in particular , the linear potential ensures that @xmath42 decreases monotonically with @xmath18 ( because @xmath103 ) , and enables estimation of @xmath61 using only a few biased simulations .",
    "+ 3 ) finally , as recognized by its authors , ui does not , in principle , require overlap between adjacent windows . in practice , however , the functional form of @xmath101 is not known a priori , so accurate estimates of @xmath102 rely on estimates of @xmath101 at finely spaced @xmath15-values .",
    "indeed , the authors use ui not to perform sparse sampling , but to illustrate that it leads to smaller statistical errors relative to wham ( weighted histogram analysis method ) .",
    "here , we use the sparse sampling method to estimate @xmath22 in the hydration shell of the protein , hydrophobin ii ( pdb i d : 2b97 ) , which is known to have a large hydrophobic patch on the protein surface . as shown in figure  [ fig : hfb ] , the protein displays characteristics that are quite similar to that of the protein , ubiquitin , discussed in the main text .    , to a biasing potential of strength @xmath18 , displays sigmoidal behavior .",
    "( c ) the sparsely sampled @xmath28 agrees well with the exact result obtained using umbrella sampling , and displays a pronounced low-@xmath13 fat tail .",

    "<S> the free energetics of water density fluctuations near a surface , and the rare low - density fluctuations in particular , serve as reliable indicators of surface hydrophobicity ; the easier it is to displace the interfacial waters , the more hydrophobic the underlying surface . </S>",
    "<S> however , characterizing the free energetics of such rare fluctuations requires computationally expensive , non - boltzmann sampling methods like umbrella sampling . </S>",
    "<S> this inherent computational expense associated with umbrella sampling makes it challenging to investigate the role of polarizability or electronic structure effects in influencing interfacial fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , it also limits the size of the volume , which can be used to probe interfacial fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be particularly important in characterizing the hydrophobicity of large surfaces with molecular - level heterogeneities , such as those presented by proteins . to overcome these challenges , here </S>",
    "<S> we present a method for the sparse sampling of water density fluctuations , which is roughly two orders of magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling . </S>",
    "<S> we employ thermodynamic integration to estimate the free energy differences between biased ensembles , thereby circumventing the umbrella sampling requirement of overlap between adjacent biased distributions . </S>",
    "<S> further , a judicious choice of the biasing potential allows such free energy differences to be estimated using short simulations , so that the free energetics of water density fluctuations are obtained using only a few , short simulations . leveraging the efficiency of the method , </S>",
    "<S> we characterize water density fluctuations in the entire hydration shell of the protein , ubiquitin ; a large volume containing an average of more than six hundred waters .    </S>",
