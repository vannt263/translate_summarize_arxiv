    "it is now well established on the basis of astronomical and laboratory - based infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy that some form of solid , hydrogenated carbonaceous material is present in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the absorption feature at @xmath0 characteristic of the c - h stretching mode in hydrogenated carbonaceous materials is clearly and consistently revealed by observational studies of dusty lines of sight , from early near - ir spectrophotometric observations of the galactic center by soifer , russell , & merrill ( 1976 ) to the most recent observations of cygnus  ob2  # 12 , the prototypical diffuse ism line of sight , by whittet _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) using the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "other relevant observational works include : the observation of cygnus  ob2  # 12 by adamson , whittet , & duley ( 1990 ) , the near - ir spectral surveys of galactic center sources and other diffuse ism probes by sandford _",
    "et al . _  ( 1991 ) and pendleton _ et al . _  ( 1994 ) , and the near - ir spectroscopy of the proto - planetary nebula crl  618 by chiar _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) .",
    "without considering observational and laboratory work outside the @xmath4 spectral region , the spectral profile of the @xmath0 c - h stretching feature itself is not consistent with any simple hydrocarbon molecule  including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs )  or mixtures thereof ( e.g. bellamy 1975 ) .",
    "it is the signature of some form of cold ( but not frozen ) hydrogenated carbonaceous material which we will call hac .",
    "hacs comprise a wide range of materials composed only of carbon and hydrogen , but which vary in @xmath5 hybridization ratios and h / c ratio .",
    "there is substantial empirical and experimental evidence to indicate that for c - h networks the carbon hybridization ratios , which determine the structural and optical properties of the material , and the h / c ratio are related ; they do not vary independently .",
    "we point to the reviews of hac by robertson ( 1986 ) ; the `` random covalent network '' model by angus & jansen ( 1988 ) ; the `` defected graphite '' model by tamor & wu ( 1990 ) ; and the experimental characterizations of various hacs by dischler , bubenzer & koidl  ( 1983 ) ; mckenzie _ et al . _  ( 1983 ) ; tsai & bogy  ( 1987 ) ; gonzalez - hernandez , chao & pawlik  ( 1988 ) ; and tamor , wu _ et al . _  ( 1989 ) .",
    "it is clear from these works that for hac in general , regardless of production method : 1 )  the @xmath6 ratio , optical gap and the real part of the index of refraction all increase with increasing h / c ratio ; 2 )  the density and the imaginary part of the index of refraction both decrease with increasing h / c ratio ; 3 )  hacs seldom contain a significant concentration of @xmath7 hybridized carbon ; 4 )  the maximum value of h / c is near 1.5 ; and 5 )  hacs photoluminesce with an efficiency and energy of peak emission that depend on the h / c ratio . in total , these works demonstrate that amorphous , carbonaceous solids in general have predictable , well - determined optical and physical properties , despite having fundamental parameters like the h / c ratio and the @xmath6 ratio which are wide ranging .",
    "thus it is possible and indeed practical to investigate and draw conclusions about the interstellar hacs from hac analogs which are produced by methods and under conditions far different than the interstellar case .",
    "so , while the astrophysical production method of hac may be the photolysis of organic ices as proposed by bernstein _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) or greenberg _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) ( among others ) , or may be by direct deposition onto silicate cores as suggested by jones , duley , & williams ( 1990 ) , results of experiments on hac materials produced by plasma - enhanced chemical - vapor deposition ( pecvd ) , arc - evaporation , or laser ablation , for example , are directly applicable to the astrophysical problem under consideration .    it is imperative to determine more precisely the nature of interstellar hac in the light of recent reconsiderations of the abundance of solid- and gas - phase carbon in the diffuse ism .",
    "it now seems likely that the cosmic abundance of carbon ( and other heavy elements ) is perhaps as low as @xmath8 of the solar abundance , which had long been thought to be representative of abundances in the ism .",
    "snow & witt ( 1995 ) review the existing literature on the carbon abundance in the sun , in a number of recently formed b stars , and in f and g stars similar to the sun , and conclude that the abundance of carbon relative to hydrogen in the ism is @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , the amount of carbon in the gas phase has recently been redetermined more precisely by cardelli _",
    "et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) through observations with the goddard high - resolution spectrograph of the weak c ii ] @xmath10 absorption line along lines of sight with greatly different ratios of atomic to molecular hydrogen .",
    "they derive a gas - phase carbon abundance relative to hydrogen of @xmath11 .",
    "thus it appears that the amount of carbon available to form solid material in the ism  a parameter that is crucial to all dust - models of interstellar extinction ( e.g. , mathis 1996 ; li & greenberg 1997 )  is likely to be only about @xmath1 of hydrogen , to within an uncertainty of about a factor of two .",
    "thus , the first goal of this current work is to present a _ rigorous _",
    "determination of the portion of the solid - phase of carbon in the diffuse ism that must be locked in the form of hac to give rise to the observed absorption in the interstellar @xmath0 c - h stretching feature .",
    "further , it is important to understand the role interstellar hac grains play in the extinction of starlight , given the presence of hac in the general diffuse ism . in order to proceed , the complex index of refraction of hacs as a function of energy in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum",
    "must be known , in addition to the amount of this material that is present .",
    "assumptions about the structural nature of the grains ( i.e. , core / mantle or uniform composition ) and the size / shape distributions for the grains must also be made , but laboratory investigation is of little help here . tabulated optical constants of materials presented as analogs to the diffuse ism carbonaceous material , ranging from `` organic refractory '' materials to hacs and other forms of amorphous carbon , are plentiful in the literature and are used as needed in models of interstellar extinction .",
    "for example , see smith ( 1984 ) ; duley ( 1984 ) ; bussoletti _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1987 ) ; alterovitz _ et al . _  ( 1991 ) ; jenniskens ( 1993 ) ; colangeli ( 1995 ) ; and schnaiter _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "the list of `` optical constants '' works just cited , it is important to note , does not completely overlap with the list of `` ir spectroscopy papers '' cited in the previous paragraphs .",
    "so , while there has been a great deal of work in the areas of ir and uv / visible spectroscopies of hac materials , the works are in large measure disjoint . the very recent works of jaeger _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) and schnaiter _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 , 1999 ) deserve special mention as they begin to consider the problems of grain composition , structure , and optical properties collectively .    a second goal of this current work , then",
    ", is to present the complex index of refraction as a function of energy in the uv / visible for a hac material with an ir absorption spectrum that is _ quantitatively _ consistent with the latest ir observations of dust in the diffuse ism , particularly the iso spectrum of cyg .",
    "ob2  # 12 by whittet _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) , a data set that was until now not available in the literature .",
    "in addition to absorbing and scattering starlight , it has been suggested that hac grains are the carrier of the broad , red emission band known as extended red emission ( ere ) ( e.g. , duley 1985 ; witt & schild 1988 ; witt 1994 ) .",
    "ere has been detected in a variety of dusty astrophysical environments , including : reflection nebulae , planetary nebulae , dark nebulae , galactic cirrus clouds , an h ii region , the halo of m82 , and a nova .",
    "most recently , gordon , witt , & friedmann ( 1998 ) have shown that ere is also a phenomenon associated with general diffuse interstellar medium dust ( see this work for references to the numerous original ere detections ) .",
    "they also conclude that the quantum efficiency of the ere process is in excess of 10% .",
    "witt , gordon , & furton ( 1998 ) argue that this extremely high efficiency , among other things , forces a reconsideration of the notion that ere is due to interstellar hac grains .",
    "this same argument has also been made by ledoux _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) .",
    "at the very least , this finding demands a careful measurement of the photoluminescence ( pl ) efficiency of hac materials that are otherwise viable analogs to the interstellar carbonaceous material .",
    "the experimental aspects of this work concerning the pecvd of and subsequent characterization by uv / visible / ir absorption spectroscopies , optical pl spectroscopy , and uv / visible spectroscopic ellipsometry are described in  2 .",
    "a rigorous determination of the amount of carbon locked in interstellar hac grains is presented in  3.1 .",
    "the characteristics that any viable interstellar hac analog must posess , in light of the analysis presented in  3.1 , are discussed in  3.2 .",
    "the optical role hac grains are likely to play in the extinction of uv / visible starlight , and in the dust luminescence processes known as ere in the diffuse ism is considered in  3.3 .",
    "all of this is followed by a brief conclusion in  4 .",
    "in our laboratories at the university of toledo and rhode island college , we have been involved in depositing and characterizing thin films of hac and related materials for almost a decade .",
    "we use both rf- and dc - based pecvd systems to produce thin , solid films from mixtures of gas - phase precursors .",
    "we rely on uv / visible / ir absorption spectroscopies , visible and near - ir pl spectroscopy , among other techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry and electron microscopy , for analysis and characterization of these thin - film materials . in this work",
    ", we present a thorough characterization of a single hac sample , from among the many samples we have produced and analyzed , as a viable analog to the interstellar hydrogenated , carbonaceous material .",
    "the deposition method and conditions , along with a summary of the derived optical and physical properties are presented in  2.1 .",
    "the measurement and analysis that were completed to derive the physical and optical properties of this sample , including its electronic band - gap , density , h / c ratio , @xmath6 ratio , pl efficiency , complex index of refraction , and ir ( @xmath12 ) mass - absorption coefficient are presented in   2.2 - 2.5 .",
    "this interstellar hac analog was produced using a dc - based pecvd system of a somewhat unique design .",
    "although dc pecvd is electronically simpler than rf pecvd , it does not lend itself as well to depositing materials ( either conducting or insulating ) onto insulating substrates , which are most commonly used ( i.e. , fused silica and salt ) .",
    "the system we have designed minimizes this problem .",
    "it consists of a vacuum chamber pumped by a roughing pump and a diffusion pump , with a four - channel precursor gas mixing manifold .",
    "electronically , the chamber itself is grounded and the sample is deposited onto the substrate placed on a support about @xmath13 beneath a @xmath14 diameter nickel - chromium screen which serves as the cathode .",
    "all of this is surrounded by a chimney - like glass tube about @xmath15 in diameter , open at the bottom and very near the top of the chamber , in order to confine the plasma and to minimize possible contamination of the deposited samples by contaminants on the metal walls of the vacuum chamber . during the deposition process",
    ", the conducting screen is pulled to a negative dc potential which is variable between @xmath16 by a high - voltage power supply and a current - limiting resistor .",
    "the screen maintains the plasma , which causes deposition onto the substrate just below as ionized molecular fragments of the precursor gas mixture `` overshoot '' it .",
    "the screen itself is coated during the deposition process as well .",
    "for this reason , a clean screen is used for each deposition and , as a drawback , the deposition process is self - limiting because the current through the plasma into the screen decreases as the screen becomes coated by the insulating material , eventually becoming too low to support the plasma .",
    "hac films can be deposited with thickness up to about @xmath17 in a single deposition lasting about @xmath18 ; thicker films can be deposited by interrupting the process to replace the cathode screen .    in general , samples deposited under identical conditions have indentical physical and optical properties .",
    "the materials that result are thin , solid , homogeneous films ; they are not porous or particulate in nature .",
    "the deposition conditions for the hac sample presented in this work are as follows : the precursor gas was 99.99% pure methane , at a pressure of @xmath19 with a flow - rate of @xmath20 ; the electric potential was @xmath21 which established a current of @xmath22 initially .",
    "the total deposition time was @xmath23 , consisting of two sequential @xmath18 depositions between which the cathode screen was changed .",
    "the several films produced in this way turned out to be about @xmath24 thick .",
    "a sodium chloride substrate was used for subsequent ir spectroscopic analysis of the sample ; a fused silica substrate was used for subsequent uv / visible analyses .",
    "there was no indication that the hac material deposited differently onto the salt substrate than onto the fused silica substrate .",
    "the uv / visible absorption spectrum of this hac sample was recorded over the wavelength range @xmath25 with a perkin - elmer 552 dual beam spectrophotometer ; the absorbance spectrum and a corresponding `` tauc '' plot , as described in  2.2 , are shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "the optical pl spectrum covering the @xmath26 wavelength range was recorded with an ocean optics s2000 fiber - fed ccd spectrometer using the @xmath27 line of an argon - ion laser as the source of excitation .",

    "the indices of refraction ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) derived from this analysis are shown in figure  [ f3 ] .",
    "finally , the ir absorption of this sample was recorded over the frequency range @xmath12 with a nicolet 510p ft - ir spectrometer ( the low - frequency limit is imposed by the salt substrate ) ; this spectrum , reduced to mass - extinction coefficient as described in  2.5 is shown in figure  [ f4 ] .",

    "it is well known that hacs luminesce upon exposure to blue and near - uv radiation , with an overall efficiency and energy of peak emission that depend strongly and directly on the band - gap of the material ( e.g. , watanabe , hasegawa , & kurata 1982 ; silva , _ et al . _  1996",

    "furthermore , the spectrum , which is shown in figure  [ f2 ] , has been reduced to approximately represent the pl photon quantum efficiency ( qe ) by dividing the observed pl photon count by the number of absorbed excitation laser photons , as computed from the measured laser intensity and the measured sample absorbance at the laser wavelength .",
    "this method is approximate because the radiative transport of the exciting and emitted photons , including scattering and self - absorption , is not accounted for .",

    "principal uncertainties in the data are associated with determining the appropriate baseline to use to extract the profile of the feature from the astronomical spectra .",
    "it is , however , not sufficient to identify a laboratory - produced material as an analog to some interstellar material based on the observation of a single absorption feature .",
    "what other absorption features are produced by dust in the diffuse ism ?",
    "this question is most unambiguously answered by the recent observation of cyg .",

    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) using iso .",
    "absorption along this line of sight is believed to arise nearly entirely from dust in the diffuse ism .",
    "perhaps the most striking fact about the iso cyg .",
    "ob2  # 12 observation is the lack of any strong absorption features in addition to the si - o band at @xmath91 and the c - h band at @xmath0 , except possibly a very weak feature at @xmath92 , either due to c - c stretching or c - h wagging vibrations .",
    "this , however , is useful evidence in itself which serves to exclude a large number of interstellar carbonaceous grain analog materials that have been proposed to date .",
    "note , in this respect , that the ir absorption spectrum of the interstellar hac analog presented here ( figure  [ f4 ] ) is dominated by c - h stretching absorption at @xmath0 , with much less prominent absorption in the @xmath93 region which would be still less conspicuous at the signal - to - noise of the iso cyg .",
    "ob2  # 12 observation .",
    "in addition to comparing the profiles of ir absorption features observed along lines of sight through the diffuse ism with those produced by laboratory analogs , it is possible and indeed necessary to address the question of absorption - band strength .",
    "how much carbon needs to be locked in the form of interstellar hac in order to explain the _ strength _ of the interstellar @xmath0 feature ?",
    "this question is crucial in light of the recent determinations of the amount of solid carbon likely to be available to form interstellar hac material ( snow & witt 1995 ) .      in principle",
    "it is straight forward to determine the amount of carbon locked in diffuse ism hac grains from a quantitative analysis of the @xmath0 interstellar absorption feature due to c - h bonds .",
    "one measures the total optical depth in the band ( either by integrating over the band profile or by simply noting the maximum optical depth of the feature ) and determines the number of c - h bonds necessary to produce the absorption using laboratory measurements of the intrinsic absorption strength or cross section per c - h bond .",
    "indeed , several groups have done this , most notably sandford _ et al . _  ( 1991 ) ( hereafter s91 ) and duley _",
    "_  ( 1998 ) ( hereafter d98 ) .",
    "but , in practice , there are significant difficulties with the laboratory measurement and interpretation of the c - h stretching absorption - band strength which have been overlooked .",
    "s91 analyzed the @xmath0 c - h absorption feature observed toward several bright ir sources believed to be probes of the diffuse ism .",
    "they concluded that the amount of carbon necessary to produce the observed optical depth is @xmath94 , to within a factor of two , of the cosmic abundance of carbon as presented in allen ( 1973 ) ( @xmath95 h ) , or roughly @xmath96 of hydrogen .",
    "they relied , however , on c - h absorption - band strengths ( and feature widths ) measured in small hydrocarbon molecules ( c@xmath97h@xmath98 , c@xmath99h@xmath100 , and cyclo - c@xmath99h@xmath100 ) , when there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect the c - h stretching band strength in small molecules to be the same as that in solid matter .",
    "d98 measured the c - h absorption band strength for a single hac produced by laser ablation of carbon in a low pressure , hydrogen - rich atmosphere and analyzed the ir observations of lines of sight toward the galactic center by pendleton _",
    "et al . _  ( 1994 ) to conclude that @xmath101 h of carbon is necessary to explain the optical depth in the interstellar @xmath0 feature . but",
    "here , the assumption is made that the c - h stretching band strength is independent of the h / c ratio in hac , when there is in fact evidence to the contrary ( jacob & unger 1996 , hereafter ju96 ) .",
    "it is clear from both of these studies that the laboratory determinations of the intrinsic absorption strengths of various c - h modes contribute a large uncertainty to the determination of the amount of carbon locked in interstellar hac .",
    "the literature concerning the quantitative analysis of ir absorption features is especially confusing to the uninitiated ; there are about as many units for characterizing the intrinsic strength of an ir mode as there are papers doing so .",
    "the following paragraphs serve to connect two frameworks relevant to this current work .",
    "the relation most commonly used in the astronomical literature , and the one used by s91 , among others is    @xmath102    where n is the column density of absorbers , @xmath103 is the maximum optical depth in an ir absorption feature and @xmath104 is the full - width at half maximum of the feature in wavenumbers .",
    "@xmath105 is a constant with units @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "equation  [ e5 ] is an approximate relation , derived from the more formal , rigorous definition for the number density of c - h bonds ,    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the absorption coefficient as a function of frequency and the normalization constant @xmath110 is the integrated cross section per absorber , in units @xmath111 .",
    "some physical - chemistry studies of ir band strengths report band cross sections , not the @xmath105-value of equation  [ e5 ] , most notably in this context the work of ju96 .",
    "note that there is an approximate relation between @xmath105 and @xmath110    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the average or central frequency of the absorption band .",
    "in connection with determining the amount of carbon locked in interstellar hac , the work of ju96 is of utmost relevance . these authors determined the integrated absorption cross section per c - h bond experimentally in a large number of hac samples covering a range in h / c ratio from about 0.3 to about 1 . which is not the sandford _",

    "they found that the cross section varied linearly with h / c such that @xmath114 for @xmath115h / c@xmath116 band strength at high levels of hydrogenation , but these attributes do not significantly affect the discussion and conclusions that follow . ]",
    "this result complicates the analysis of the interstellar @xmath0 feature because it reveals that the h / c ratio in interstellar hac grains must be estimated in order to determine how much carbon these grains contain , since the intrinsic band strength is a function of the h / c ratio .    before proceeding to discuss the results of ju96 more thoroughly , it is instructive to compare their results to those of s91 and d98 .",

    "the profile is not very sensitive for hacs with h / c greater than about 0.3 , perhaps because there is a preference for hydrogen to bond to @xmath117-hybridized carbon .",
    "so , the profile of the c - h stretch feature alone is not sufficient to remove the complication .",
    "the mass - absorption coefficient @xmath127 for the c - h stretch feature is the quantity that directly relates the strength of the observed interstellar band to the amount of carbon locked in interstellar hac grains .",

    "we can , however , draw important conclusions from this analysis , and can use these results to place limits on the interstellar hac grain problem . on the surface , it is clear that interstellar hac grains must be hydrogenated at least to the level h / c@xmath2 , and at this limit most of the available solid carbon would need to be in form of hac grains .",
    "the other limit is not so precisely delineated .",
    "it is clear that if the hac grains are extremely highly hydrogenated , to the maximum h / c@xmath159 , then the amount of carbon needed to produce the observed optical depth in the @xmath0 feature would be small , perhaps as low as @xmath3 hydrogen .",
    "but , as we discuss in  3.3 , this seems unlikely because these hacs photoluminesce efficiently in the blue - green and such emission has never been observed in interstellar environments .",
    "the data in table  [ t5 ] can be used to evaluate the viability of other potential interstellar hac analogs . from a purely qualitative standpoint , any material proposed as an analog to the hydrogenated carbonaceous component of the diffuse ism must produce absorption in the ir that is dominated by the c - h stretch feature at @xmath0 , given the recent iso observation of cyg .",
    "ob2  # 12 by whittet _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the lack of other strong features along this line of sight ( excepting the si - o band at @xmath160 ) is meaningful . in light of this ,",
    "the suggestion that solids such as the organic refractory eureka materials of greenberg _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) , for example , are analogs to the carbonaceous component of the diffuse ism must not be taken too literally because they show significant absorption due to bonds other than c - h and c - c .",
    "these materials do , however , offer intriguing insight into a possible interstellar hac production method .    from a quantitative standpoint ,",
    "the results of the previous section provide a key criterion to which all interstellar hac analogs must be held .",
    "given that only @xmath1 of carbon relative to hydrogen is likely to be depleted from the gas phase to form solid carbonaceous material ( snow & witt 1995 ) , any laboratory analog to the interstellar hac material must have a mass - absorption coefficient at the peak of the c - h stretch feature in excess of @xmath161 , and in order to do so must be hydrogenated to a level of h / c@xmath162 .",
    "the interstellar hac analog presented in this work , with h / c @xmath163 and @xmath164 , appears to be a limiting material in the sense that it produces absorption in the c - h stretch feature with a strength that would require all of the available solid carbon to be in form of this type of material .",
    "other interstellar hac analogs presented to date , however , appear in this analysis to require more the solid carbon than is available in order to account for the interstellar @xmath0 feature ( borghesi _ et al . _  1985",

    "of course , uncertainty in the true amount of solid - phase carbon in the ism constrains each of these interstellar hac analogs to different degrees ; each must be considered on a case by case basis . however , that materials with lower mass - absorption coefficients in the @xmath0 band require more solid - phase carbon to account for the observed strength of this feature  perhaps more than is available  remains a valid conclusion .",
    "while determination of ir mass - absorption spectra for interstellar grain analogs is a necessary quantification , it has only been done by a limited number of groups .",
    "et al . _  ( 1987 ) and colangeli _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) produced and analyzed a variety of hac materials ( denoted be , acar , ach2 , etc  ) , derived by arc - evaporation of graphite , and determined mass - absorption spectra for them through the near - ir along with other properties , including indices of refraction , which , incidently , have been used subsequently by mathis ( 1996 ) to compute his most recent dust model . for these materials , however , @xmath34 is only on the order of @xmath165  clearly too low to account for the interstellar @xmath0 feature .",
    "more recently , schnaiter _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) produced a variety of matrix - isolated nano - sized carbon grains and , among other things , determined the mass - absorption coefficient in the c - h stretch feature .",
    "they found @xmath34 to range from near zero to around @xmath166 for the most highly hydrogenated materials they produced .",
    "the mostly highly hydrogenated of these materials may possibly be able to account for the @xmath0 feature , given the uncertainty in the true amount of solid - phase carbon that is available . finally , d98 produced an interstellar hac analog by laser ablation of graphite in a low - pressure , hydrogen - rich atmosphere , and analyzed the strength of the c - h stretch feature .",
    "although they do not specifically compute @xmath34 , it is apparently approximately @xmath167 , based on the h / c ratio they quote and the `` @xmath105-value '' ( of equation  [ e5 ] ) they determine ; again considerably lower than necessary to account for all of the absorption in the interstellar @xmath0 feature .",
    "so , although a number of carbonaceous materials have been presented in the literature over the past few years as sources of the interstellar @xmath0 feature , and thus as interstellar hac analogs , the hac presented in this work is the first to be shown to be _ quantitatively _ consistent with ir observations in the @xmath12 spectral region of lines of sight which unambiguously sample only the diffuse ism .",
    "given the presence in the diffuse ism of some form of hydrogenated carbonaceous solid , as betrayed by the interstellar @xmath0 feature , it is necessary to consider carefully the roles it may and may not play in other uv / visible / ir phenomena .",
    "hac is included as a source of opacity in the current dust models of mathis ( 1996 ) and li & greenberg ( 1997 ) , and has been proposed as the source or carrier of the broad , red dust luminescence band known as ere ( e.g. , duley 1985 ; witt 1994 ) , near - ir ( @xmath168 ) non - thermal continuum radiation ( jones , duley , & williams 1990 ) , and the @xmath89 bump ( colangeli _ et al . _  1993 ; schnaiter _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) , in addition to being the assumed source of the interstellar @xmath0 feature .",
    "the extent to which hac grains can indeed fill all of these roles must continue to be reviewed in light of new astronomical and laboratory data .",
    "although hac is assumed to be a major source of opacity in the near - uv and visible ( li & greenberg 1997 ) , its optical constants in this spectral region are by far the poorest determined of most astrophysically important materials . in addition , the recent recent dust models of li & greenberg 1997 and mathis ( 1996 ) require that the imaginary part of the index of refraction for the material causing visible / near - uv absorption needs to be as high as @xmath169 .",
    "if so , then the material causing this absorption is not the hac responsible for the interstellar @xmath0 feature , for the simple reason that hacs which produce significant optical depth per carbon atom in the c - h stretch band are not nearly this absorbing in the visible .",
    "as demonstrated in figure  [ f3 ] , our hac sample , which matches the interstellar c - h feature both in profile and in mass - absorption coefficient ( at a minimum level ) , is essentially transparent in the visible , with @xmath30 rising to about @xmath169 only in the near - uv .",
    "further , we consider this a limiting material because increasing its visual opacity would require lowering its bandgap below its present value ( @xmath170 ) , decreasing its mass - absorpton coefficient in the c - h stretch band to where more than @xmath1 solid phase carbon would be required to match the c - h band strength , and shifting its c - h band profile toward frequencies higher than observed .",
    "hac , then , is not the sole source of absorption in the visible / near - uv .    a recent paper by adamson _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) , describing spectropolarimetric observations of the interstellar @xmath0 feature observed toward the galactic center source sgr .",
    "a  irs7 , provides an additional clue to the nature of the carrier of this absorption band .",
    "they find this feature to be unpolarized with an upper limit well below that expected on the basis of a model in which the carrier bonds are associated with the aligned silicate grains ( i.e. , silicate - core / hac - mantle grains ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the ir - active hac grains are extremely small  below the rayleigh limit .",
    "if this is the case , then it seems again that the hac material is very highly hydrogenated with a correspondingly high c - h stretch mass - absorption coefficient .",
    "interestingly enough , small hac grains have recently been shown in the lab by schnaiter _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) to produce broad absorption around @xmath89 , thus making them candidates for the carrier of the interstellar @xmath89 extinction feature .",
    "they concluded , in fact , that small hac grains locking up about @xmath171 carbon relative to hydrogen could explain the observed strength of the @xmath89 bump .",
    "in addition , these laboratory - produced hac grains have a mass - absorption coefficient in the @xmath0feature of @xmath172 , which is near but lower than the required @xmath173 .",
    "it thus appears that small hac grains are a promising source of both the @xmath89 bump and the @xmath0 c - h feature .",
    "but , they would need to lock up essentially all the solid - phase carbon if the recent works of schnaiter _ et al . _",
    "1998 and schnaiter _",
    "et al . _",
    "1999   are final .",
    "it is important to note that the hac sample presented in this current work does not produce structure in the @xmath174 spectral region .",
    "finally , it has been suggested that hac grains are the carrier of ere observed in a variety of astrophysical environments ( duley , seahra , & williams 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , however , gordon , witt , & friedmann ( 1998 ) and szomoru & guhathakurta ( 1998 ) have shown that ere is also produced by dust in the diffuse ism with a quantum efficiency so high as to call into question its hac origin . by comparing the absorbed fraction of the interstellar radiation field , integrated over the @xmath175 range , with",
    "the observed ere intensity over the same lines of sight , gordon , witt , & friedmann  ( 1998 ) conclude and szomoru & guhathakurta confirmed that @xmath176 of all absorbed photons lead to the production of ere photons . since the ere carrier is most likely only one of several dust components contributing to the absorption in the uv / visible wavelength range , the true quantum efficiency of the ere process must be larger than 10% , and could be as high as 40% to 50% .",
    "the quantum efficiency of pl in hac ( silva _ et al . _  1996",
    "; rusli , robertson , & amaratunga 1996 ; witt , ryutov , & furton 1997 ) is closely correlated with the bandgap , which in turn is correlated with the h / c ratio .",
    "high - efficiency pl occurs in hac only if the bandgap is large , of order @xmath177 , which implies , under uv illumination , blue - green luminescence instead of red emission .",
    "the absence of blue emission in astronomical sources ( rush & witt 1975 ; witt & boroson 1990 ) argues thus against the presence of such high - bandgap hac and the large h / c ratios this would imply . materials such as the hac sample discussed in this paper can contribute to the ere in the correct wavelength range , but only with a modest quantum efficiency of about 5% . at best",
    ", it would be a partial contributor to the ere observed in the diffuse ism .",
    "other possible sources for the ere , such as silicon nanoparticles ( witt , gordon , & furton 1998 ; ledoux _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) or large pah molecules ( dhendecourt _ et al . _",
    "1986 ) must therefore be considered as main contributors .",
    "further , the absence of blue emission in ere sources also argues against the presence of hacs with h / c@xmath162 .",
    "this limits at the low end the amount of carbon contained in interstellar hac grains because of the existence of the correlation between the h / c ratio and the band mass - absorption coefficient ( see table  [ t5 ] ) .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the amount of carbon locked up in hac is nearer @xmath1 than @xmath3 of hydrogen .",
    "in summary , we have produced and thoroughly characterized a hac sample that is , on the basis of a _ quantitative _ comparison of the ir absorption spectra of the hac and of the diffuse ism , a viable analog to the true interstellar hac material .",
    "both spectra are dominated by the c - h stretching feature at @xmath0 , with much weaker absorption in the @xmath178 range due to c - c stretching and c - h wagging modes ( in addition to the si - o band in the interstellar spectrum ) .",
    "this hac has a density of @xmath46 , an electronic band - gap of @xmath32 , h / c and @xmath6 ratios both near @xmath179 , a peak mass - absorption coefficient in the @xmath0 band of @xmath164 , and an integrated pl quantum efficiency of @xmath36 with peak emission near @xmath51 .",
    "we have also determined via spectroscopic ellipsometry the complex index of refraction for this hac in the wavelength range @xmath28 , finding @xmath29 to be nearly constant near @xmath180 and @xmath30 to rise exponentially from near zero in the visible to around @xmath169 in the near - uv .",
    "we carefully analyzed the profile and strength of the @xmath0 c - h stretching absorption band in hac and the diffuse ism .",
    "we review the results of jacob & unger ( 1996 ) , showing that the intrinsic strength of the @xmath0 feature per c - h bond , and thus the amount of carbon that needs to be bound in hac in the diffuse ism , is a strong function of the degree of hydrogenation of the material .",
    "hacs with h / c@xmath2 , like the sample described in this work , are minimally able to provide the observed optical depth in the interstellar @xmath0 feature , requiring approximately @xmath1 carbon relative to hydrogen  essentially all the available solid - phase carbon .",
    "hacs with h / c much lower than @xmath179 require increasingly more than @xmath1 of carbon relative to hydrogen , and thus do not appear to be viable interstellar hac analogs .",
    "hacs with h / c much higher than @xmath179 , while able to account for the @xmath0 feature optical depth with less carbon , perhaps as little as @xmath3 of hydrogen , also do not appear to be viable analogs because these materials as a rule exhibit blue - green photoluminescence with an efficiency on the order of @xmath181  such dust emission has never been observed .",
    "so , we conclude that interstellar hac must be hydrogenated to a level of about @xmath182 and that this material locks up most of the available solid - phase carbon .",
    "finally , we consider other optical roles interstellar hac is likely to play in the diffuse ism .",
    "we conclude that hac is not the dominant source of the ere band , which has now been conclusively detected in the diffuse ism , because hac s pl spectrum and quantum efficiency differ significantly from ere .",
    "we also conclude that hac is not the sole source of opacity in the visible and near - uv because hacs with @xmath183 in this spectral region require far more carbon than is available in the solid phase to account for the observed @xmath0 band optical depth .",
    "in addition , it is important to note that the bulk - solid hac which we have produced does not show any structure in the spectral vicinity of @xmath89 .",
    "the authors are grateful to yvonne pendleton and doug whittet for providing observational data , margaret tuma for assistance with the spectroscopic ellipsometry of our hac sample , and thomas henning for a thorough critique of the manuscript .",

    "<S> some form of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) is widely regarded as a likely component of dust in the diffuse interstellar medium of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the most direct observational evidence is the @xmath0 c - h stretch feature seen in absorption along heavily attenuated lines of sight . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the measured properties of one well - characterized hac sample , together with well - established correlations between the structural , optical , and infrared ( ir ) characteristics of hac materials in general , to estimate the amount of carbon relative to hydrogen that must be bound in this particular solid in interstellar space . </S>",
    "<S> the solution to this problem remains uncertain because of the strong dependence of the @xmath0 mass - absorption coefficient upon the h / c ratio in hac materials . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that about @xmath1 carbon relative to hydrogen is locked up in interstellar hac grains with h / c@xmath2 . a h / c ratio lower than this value would require higher carbon depletions and result in a @xmath0 absorption profile inconsistent with observations . substantially higher h / c ratios , which would imply carbon depletions as low as @xmath3 , would lead to materials exhibiting efficient blue - green photoluminescence , which is not observed . combined with observations of the gas - phase interstellar abundance of carbon and the revised interstellar reference abundances of refractory elements </S>",
    "<S> , this result implies that the bulk of solid carbon in interstellar space is in the form of hac . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a careful analysis of the ir properties of hac , we present a summary of the uv / visible optical properties , including the complex index of refraction , measured for one particularly well - characterized hac sample that is shown to have an ir absorption spectrum which is _ quantitatively _ consistent with the latest ir observations of the diffuse interstellar medium . </S>"
