    "the recent announcement of the discovery  @xcite of the so called penta - quark states has rekindled interest in the possibility of exotic hadron states . in the last decade ,",
    "a large number of exotic mesonic states known as the x , y , z states  @xcite have been observed by different experimental collaborations , belle , babar , besiii , cdf , cleo , lhcb etc .",
    "long ago , a proposal was made to identify the @xmath0 baryon as a possible molecular state of a colourless baryon and meson  @xcite . recently",
    "this proposal was confirmed through lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "while the existence of such exotic states has been theoretically studied over decades  @xcite using models of quark confinement with hyperfine interaction , we explore the possibility of identifying states which differ in their underlying dynamics due to different interaction scales responsible for forming composite states such as mesons .",
    "this is a model independent analysis which depends entirely on the information already contained in the experimental data on the spectra of composite states .",
    "the method itself is not new .",
    "it has been in vogue in the study of semiconductors with impurities ( which may have closely spaced electronic spectra ) or in the analysis of spectra of deformed nuclear states for a long time . in principle when the number of states are large , the high temperature behaviour of the specific heat directly yields the information about the relevant degrees of freedom in the spectrum- this is the well known dulong - petit law .",
    "this has been effectively put to use in the analysis of the light baryon spectrum by bhaduri and dey  @xcite where they have shown that even with truncated spectrum of light quark baryon states , the degrees of freedom of the system may be inferred by comparing the models with the experimental spectrum through the so called schottky peak .",
    "however , such an analysis can not be applied to the meson spectrum to infer the degrees of freedom as may be inferred from an analysis of the meson spectrum .    on the other hand ,",
    "when a truncated spectrum is available with no saturation possible , the specific heat at low temperature displays a schottky peak ( or peaks ) which is an indication of the relevant scale ( scales ) in the system .",
    "therefore the method we use here , consists of analyzing the heat capacity @xmath1 of a spectrum of states which may contain finitely many states that may not lead to saturation of the specific heat .",
    "the existence of schottky peak ( peaks ) is taken as an indication of the presence of an interaction scale ( scales ) and analyzed further .",
    "this provides a possible model independent diagnostic of the presence of unusual or exotic states .",
    "the only input used is the experimentally measured spectrum of states .    in sec.ii",
    ", we illustrate the method with a set of assumed ideal spectra closely following the illustrations adopted from ref .  @xcite .",
    "though the method has been widely used in other fields , it may not be familiar to the practitioners in particle physics phenomenology .",
    "in sec.iii we first discuss the charmonium spectrum to illustrate the applicability of the method to the measured spectrum of states using the lists provided in pdg  @xcite .",
    "charmonium spectrum provides a template for the analysis of other states .",
    "further , we discuss other cases including the bottomonium and open - charm / bottom mesons and show that interesting facts emerge by a simple application of the idea of the schottky anomaly .",
    "we conclude with a mention of caveats and how the method may be fruitfully used as and when more data becomes available particularly for the conjectured exotic bottomonium states .",
    "in order to illustrate the method , consider the simplest case of a two level system with an energy gap given by @xmath2 .",
    "the energy gap is an indication of the scale in the hamiltonian .",
    "the canonical partition function of the system is simply given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the inverse temperature .",
    "hereafter we set the boltzmann constant @xmath5 and the temperature is given in energy units .",
    "for the purpose of illustration here we have not assumed any occupancy factors .",
    "the temperature is introduced here simply as a mathematical parameter to define the partition function of the system and no assumption is made regarding the system being in a heat bath in equilibrium .",
    "it is a parameter that is used to calculate the specific heat or more precisely energy fluctuations .",
    "the specific heat of the system at constant volume may be defined as @xmath6 = \\beta^2[\\langle e^2\\rangle-\\langle e\\rangle^2 ] .",
    "\\label{cvdef}\\ ] ] in systems with constant density , we may replace @xmath1 by @xmath1 . substituting for the partition function of the two level system given in eq.([idealz ] ) we have @xmath7 when @xmath1 is plotted against @xmath8 the schottky peak appears at a value @xmath9 with an exponential tail at higher values of @xmath10 .",
    "the location of the peak is a function of the energy gap in the system . in general",
    "the schottky peak occurs in systems with few energy levels where gaps are a result of a single scale parameter .",
    "if however , there is more than one independent scale parameter responsible for the energy levels , then peaks appear whenever the temperature is sufficient to cross the gap signaling a change in the entropy of the system . at high temperatures",
    "when all the levels are equally possible , a plateau appears signaling very little change in the entropy .    to further expand on this theme",
    ", we next consider an ideal spectrum , namely the spectrum of a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "the partition function of the system is given by @xmath11 where the oscillator parameter @xmath12 defines the scale in the problem and @xmath13 is the degeneracy of the level . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the effect of truncation on the specific heat when plotted as a function of @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( say ) . as we include more and more orbitals , the specific heat tends to reach the required saturation , while the peak persists in the truncated spectrum .        as we shall see later , in any realistic hadronic spectrum , especially in the heavy quark sector",
    ", we do not need more than 2 to 3 orbitals to count the observed spectrum of states .",
    "for these cases the location of the schottky peak is close to @xmath16 .    in order to simulate a realistic spectra where there is a possibility of more than one energy scale in operation , we combine the spectra of two such systems which differ in @xmath17 significantly . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the individual spectra separately as well as the spectra for the combined single set .",
    "the effect of combining is to normalize the specific heat with a single partition function given by , @xmath18 this is somewhat artificial but nevertheless we use this for the purpose of illustrating the effect of the presence of multiple scales in the spectra when the states are combined in a listing in the absence of any dynamical information .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the amplitude and location of the two separate schottky peaks depend on truncation apart from the oscillator frequencies .",
    "when combined , the peak corresponding to the lower frequency remains unchanged while the one corresponding to higher frequency is sensitive to truncation .",
    "this is simply due to the domination of the lower scale in the partition function .",
    "+    we exploit this sensitivity to different scales in the problem , and apply it in the analysis of experimental spectra of sets of mesons in the next section .",
    "different scales may arise from different terms in the same hamiltonian , for example the confinement scale could be very different from the splitting of states with different spins , namely the hyperfine splitting .",
    "alternatively the data set could contain states which may arise from different underlying dynamics and hence have different scales .",
    "often it may so happen that the data set is missing a certain number of states which also introduces an artificial scale ( or energy gap ) in the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of schottky peaks in the experimental spectra may reveal some hidden scales on the average .",
    "we must however caution that this analysis will not reveal any detailed dynamics ( or the system hamiltonian ) underlying the formation of the bound states .",
    "we consider an analysis , based on the template given in the previous section , of the experimental data on mesons .",
    "we divide the data sets according to their flavours and start from the simplest cases , where there is no complication arising from the isospin degeneracies . in this analysis",
    "we only use the identification given in the particle data group tables without any further theoretical bias .",
    "we focus on the heavy quark sector .",
    "we first choose to analyze the spectra of the @xmath19 ( charmonium ) states as identified in the pdg  @xcite , listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".charmonium masses given in mev along with their total angular momentum @xmath20 .",
    "other quantum numbers are not needed for this analysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     nevertheless some features are already visible .",
    "for example when all the states are plotted together as shown in fig .",
    "[ bmes ] , we discern the confinement as well as the hf peak ( at a reduced temperature ) , similar to the open charm scenario .    separation into various @xmath20 and @xmath21 lists can not be carried out here since there are only two states each in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 sectors .",
    "it is not possible to plot the @xmath22 , @xmath23 states against @xmath26 due to different flavour contents .",
    "for example , 5366.77 mev state is a @xmath27 ( b and s quark ) state whereas the 6275.6 mev state is a @xmath28 ( b and c quark ) state .    for completeness",
    ", we may however plot the @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 states each of which has only two states .",
    "we have showed the plot in fig .",
    "[ bmesj1 ] where again the peaks coincide indicating the confinement scale .",
    "more detailed analysis must wait for more data .",
    "we have presented a model independent analysis of the data on the meson spectra using the schottky anomaly . given a spectrum of states , the specific heat ( or equivalently energy fluctuation ) when plotted as a function of temperature displays peaks , known as schottky peaks , corresponding to the different scales present in the interaction hamiltonian which gives rise to such states .",
    "the peaks are well pronounced especially if the spectrum is truncated with very few orbitals as in the case of meson spectra .",
    "the corresponding temperature at which the schottky peaks occur may be converted into energy scales relevant to the spectra on hand .",
    "this method is well known in other areas of physics .    in this analysis temperature",
    "is simply treated as a parameter which is used to extract the scale and should not be confused with the thermodynamic temperature .",
    "the information so obtained is nothing new since it is already contained in the spectra , but it provides a new way of looking at the data and analyzing the same .",
    "this is especially useful if a given set of states , in the absence of any other information , contains states which may have their origin in different types of interaction hamiltonians , for example the presence of exotics in the quarkonium states . unlike the models of quarkonium states , no dynamical information may be extracted .",
    "but the intuition from the potential models or lattice calculations may be used to gain more insight .      *",
    "the simplest to analyze are the quarkonium states , especially the charmonium states .",
    "using this as a template we show how the two main scales corresponding to flavour independent confinement interaction and the hf interaction may be seen from the representation of the data through schottky peaks .",
    "typically the average confinement scale ( corresponding to the radial potential in a model ) results in a peak around @xmath29 mev . if we are to interpret this information in terms of the actual scale of confinement we need to invoke a model .",
    "if there are only two to three orbitals involved ( as is the case in most of the data ) then a ball park estimate of the confinement scale is given approximately by @xmath30 .",
    "it varies very slowly with truncation of the orbitals as seen in the ideal case .",
    "the schottky peak corresponding to hf interaction results in a peak around @xmath31 mev which results in an average splitting of about 90 mev as given by potential models .",
    "+ an analysis of the so called exotic states in the charmonium sector seems to indicate that they are indeed unusual states due to the absence of the usual confinement peak , but exhibit a peak at a lower @xmath26 , about @xmath32 mev , corresponding to a lower @xmath33exotic confinement scale at @xmath34 mev . * our conclusions in the case of bottomonium states are similar to the charmonium states .",
    "the hf interaction is much weaker here as it should be if one uses the intuition from potential models .",
    "these states also exhibit the confinement peak at around @xmath35 mev .",
    "interestingly , the so called exotics again display a peak at about @xmath32 mev , similar to the exotics in the charmonium sector . *",
    "the analysis of open charm and open bottom states is more complicated but nevertheless we do get some insight into the scales involved .    finally without going into details ,",
    "we add a few comments on the light quark sector .",
    "the light quark sector is the most complicated since here the intuition from the potential models are not as clean as in the case of the heavy quark sector .",
    "furthermore , the hf splitting is comparable to the confinement scale .",
    "this results in a single broad peak which may be due to a combination of confinement and hf splitting .",
    "both in non - strange and strange quark pseudo scalar bound states the confinement scale shifts to a much larger value due to the complication arising from the masses of pion and k - meson . however , when @xmath36 states are analyzed they display the confinement peak as witnessed in all other sectors .",
    "this buttresses the well known problem with pions , that they are too light to be simple bound states of quark and an antiquark  @xcite .",
    "this is also true , to a lesser extent , with the pseudo scalar k - mesons around 495 mev .",
    "while we have analyzed the data on meson spectra here , we may analyze the baryon spectra also from this perspective . in some ways",
    "this later analysis is likely to provide complimentary information further simplified by the fact that only quarks are involved unless the exotics are considered .",
    "this analysis is underway and will be published later  @xcite .",
    "we thank r. k. bhaduri for many suggestions and careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "the ideas outlined in the paper originated during the discussions in the hep journal club .",
    "we thank all the members of jc for their helpful comments , especially srihari gopalakrishna , d indumathi and rahul sinha .",
