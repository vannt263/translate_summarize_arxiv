    "this theory is precisely the one studied in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was found that the theory allows two ( or five , according to taste ) dual descriptions where the roles of @xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 get interchanged .",
    "for example , @xmath3 is the dilaton / axion field for the heterotic string , the khler form for the type @xmath162 string and the complex structure of the type @xmath163 string .",
    "however , all those theories were of the same type , in the sense that ( at least in the truncated versions considered here ) two symmetries were perturbative and one was non - perturbative .",

    "we can also compare how @xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 dualities ( [ dualities ] ) are realized as @xmath156 matrices .",
    "for this we go first in a basis @xmath6 ( heterotic string compactified on a two - torus ) .",
    "this can be done by the symplectic rotation @xmath177 in this new basis the @xmath158 transformations are realized by a matrix ( [ spmatrix ] ) with @xcite @xmath178 as we can see , in this basis only the @xmath3-duality is non - perturbative ( exchange of electric with magnetic charges ) whereas the @xmath10-and @xmath11-duality acts diagonal , i.e.  exchange electric with electric and magnetic with magnetic quantum numbers . finally , to get the transformation for our original charges we have to invert the transformation @xmath179 . combining all symplectic transformations we find for our charges in the @xmath1 basis the transformations @xmath180    as expected ,",

    "note , that under dualization the pre - factor of @xmath183 gets inverted .",
    "this dualization makes all duality symmetries in the @xmath5 basis non - perturbative .",
    "the statement that in this symmetric basis none of the dualities is perturbative is equivalent to the statement that there is no basis in which all of dualities are perturbative .",

    "we could take @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "these three possibilities fix then the three underlying string theories ( heterotic , type iia or type iib ) .",
    "when all three theories are symmetrised by going to the @xmath1 basis , immediately all dualities become non - perturbative .",
    "these transformations can be nicely visualized in the form of a cube , as it was done in @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows how the dualities transform the field strengths into each other and their duals in the @xmath5 model .",
    "figure 1 and figure 2 also illustrate the crucial difference with the @xmath6- , @xmath8- and @xmath9-models of @xcite ( figure 2 ) . in the @xmath1 theory , the fundamental field strengths ( or electric charges ) are located around @xmath185 , whereas in the @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 models the fundamental fields were located on one side of the cube , allowing 2 dualities to be perturbative .",
    "the black holes with vanishing axions and finite scalars all have four charges .",
    "these charges must be located on four corners of the cube which are not connected by edges .",
    "hence , the choices one has are @xmath186 ( with product of 4 charges @xmath187 positive ) and @xmath188 ( with product of 4 charges @xmath189 negative ) , which is consistent with our results . in the @xmath3- , @xmath10- , or @xmath11- string picture one always needed two electric and two magnetic charges .",
    "in conclusion , we have found a new type of d=4 supersymmetric black holes in the context of n=2 special geometry related to calabi - yau threefold .",
    "the main difference with the existing supersymmetric black holes is a completely _ democratic treatment of all moduli of the theory_. this is due to our use of the version of special geometry with the prepotential @xmath16 @xcite where @xmath17 are real symmetric constant tensors .",
    "a particular model of this type with @xmath0 gives no preference to any of the moduli and therefore none of them can play a role of coupling constants .",
    "this makes the new @xmath5 black holes different from stringy @xmath6- , @xmath8- and @xmath9 black holes @xcite , @xcite where one of the moduli ( @xmath3 in heterotic case , @xmath10 in type iia case and @xmath11 in type iib case ) does play the role of the coupling constant .",

    "the new result found in this paper for four - dimensional black holes is the value of the moduli @xmath194 as the function of charges at the fixed point @xmath195 for particular example of @xmath17 .",
    "it can be used to find also the area of the five - dimensional black holes as the function of charges for this theory .",
