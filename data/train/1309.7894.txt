    "* ) and only a handful exhibit appreciable geometric albedos .",
    "caution is needed when interpreting hot - jupiter geometric albedos , as for the most irradiated objects , a significant part of the planetary spectral energy distribution leaks into visible wavelengths , complicating the distinction between reflected light and thermal emission .",

    "our analysis of the 3.6-@xmath8 m data resulted in significant correlated noise in both time - series ( @xmath1040% ) . because of the long occultation duration of kepler-7b ( 5.3 hours ) , the remaining out - of - transit photometry is small on each side of the eclipse , making the occultation parameters retrieval delicate in the presence of correlated noise . in a second step ,",
    "we apply the noise - pixel variable aperture technique @xcite to all aors .",

    ", we use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) implementation presented in @xcite .",

    "our _ spitzer_/irac raw lightcurves are shown on fig.[fig_spitzer ] ( left ) .",
    "we repeat the same mcmc fits for both channels setting the occultation depth to zero , to compare the bic between a model that includes the occultation and a model that does not .",
    "the mcmc fits including the occultation model yield an occultation depth of 164@xmath18150 ppm at 3.6@xmath8 m and 367@xmath18221 ppm at 4.5@xmath8 m .",
    "we compare the bic of these runs to the mcmc fits that do not include the occultation model",
    ". the odds ratio between both models is @xmath9180 and @xmath9100 in favor of the model without occultation at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m respectively .",
    "based on our dataset , the occultation is detected in none of the channels .",
    "we derive corresponding 3-@xmath19 upper limits of 615 and 1010 ppm at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m .",
    "we employ a phoenix @xcite model of kepler-7 using the d11 stellar parameters to convert these occultation depth upper - limits into brightness temperatures .",

    "our final phase - folded occultation lightcurves are shown on fig.[fig_spitzer ] ( right ) .",
    "we base our analysis on _ kepler _ @xcite quarters 1 - 14 long - cadence simple aperture photometry @xcite that span more than 1,200 days of quasi - continuous observations , which is three times more data than in d11 .",
    "we mitigate instrumental systematics by fitting the first four cotrending basis vectors ( cbv ) to each quarter using the pyke software @xcite .",
    "we find that outliers represent less than @xmath90.5% of the dataset .",
    "we then normalize each quarter to the median . in total ,",
    "56,000 datapoints are collected .",
    "we employ our mcmc framework presented in sect.[spitzer ] to account for photometric trends longer than twice the planetary orbital period by fitting a second - order polynomial to the out - of - eclipse data .",
    "we then evaluate the contribution from correlated noise on timescales corresponding to the orbital period .",
    "we cut the whole data into 5-day duration segments and compute a scaling factor @xmath20 based on the standard deviation of the binned residuals for each light curve using different time - bins @xcite .",
    "we keep the largest @xmath20 value as a criterion to discard data segments affected by significant correlated noise .",
    "we obtain a mean @xmath21 over the whole data set and discard those with threshold @xmath22 , which account for @xmath95% of the complete dataset .",
    "all data discarded affect predominantly quarters 12 - 14 , when increased solar activity and coronal mass ejections resulted in a decrease of _ kepler _ s pointing accuracy and thus an increase in systematic noise .",
    "we finally note that in contrary to pre - whitening techniques ( as employed in d11 ) , the data - reduction method presented here preserves all phase - curve properties .      to assess the robustness of the phase - curve properties , we repeat the analysis presented above several times , by increasing the number of cbv components up to 8 , by decreasing the threshold @xmath20 values and by using linear or third - order polynomials to account for the long - term trends . we find the phase amplitude , peak - offset and occultation depth values to remain consistent within 1-@xmath19 uncertainties ( see sect.[phase - analysis ] ) .",
    "the phase - curve signal is therefore not due to ( nor affected by ) the detrending .",
    "two of us ( bod , tb ) performed independent analyses of the dataset and obtained results in excellent agreement",
    ".    figures [ fig_kep_q ] and [ fig_kep ] demonstrate the stability of the phase - curve signal across q1-q14 .",
    "this would not be the case if the phase curve was of instrumental origin as while _ kepler _ systematics can be consistent in amplitude across quarters , they are definitely not consistent in phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "any signal due to _ kepler _ systematics would thus average out across quarters .",
    "this strongly favors the phase - curve being of astrophysical origin .",
    "we search for all frequencies in the dataset to assess any risk of contamination of the planetary phase curve . to quantify how frequencies and amplitudes evolve with time",
    ", we perform a wavelet transform analysis using the weighted wavelet z - transform algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "we do not detect any clear signature , apart from the planet orbital signal .",
    "kepler-7 is intrinsically quiet and any stellar activity remains nominal over q1-q14 observations , with no quarter - dependent fluctuations .",
    "we notice a barely detectable periodicity at @xmath916.7 days that could correspond to the rotational period of the star , which translates to an equatorial velocity of @xmath23 km / s assuming @xmath24 ( d11 ) .",
    "this is broadly consistent with kepler-7 s stellar projected rotation @xmath25 km s@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the host star is unlikely to contaminate our phase - curve for several reasons .",
    "as we phase - fold data over more 3.5 years , only stellar variability exactly phased on the planetary orbital period ( or a multiple ) and consistent over the duration of the observations could affect the phase - curve shape . first , the stellar rotational velocity suggests that the star is not tidally locked to the planet , as the planetary orbital period is only @xmath94.89 days .",
    "the stellar rotation and planetary orbital periods are different by a non - integer factor of @xmath93.4 .",
    "second , stellar pulsations with a period of @xmath95 days are unlikely for a sub - giant star and would have been visible in the data .",
    "third , as we do not clearly detect stellar variability in the photometry , only small starspots could be present , but those starspots would have a short lifetime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even in the case of starspots that are stable over more than three years , differential rotation would cause distortions in the lightcurve across quarters that are not observed ( fig.[fig_kep_q ] ) .",
    "furthermore , spots or group of spots do not usually produce sinusoidal lightcurves but rather sequences of flat and v - shaped lightcurves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we do not detect interactions between the star and the planet in the form of ellipsoidal or beaming components in the phase curve .",
    "we finally take into account a faint stellar companion located 1.9-east of kepler-7 with a @xmath27mag@xmath28 both in @xmath29 and @xmath30 bands @xcite .",
    "these flux ratios suggest a similar spectral type and discard the possibility of a cool star . in order to detect a significant contamination from the companion star with a period commensurate with kepler-7b s orbital period , we split the full dataset in segments of duration equal to a quarter .",
    "each quarter has a specific aperture with a different contribution from the fainter companion star .",
    "the reported consistency at the 1-@xmath19 level of the phase curve properties ( amplitude , phase - peak offset ) across quarters suggest a negligible contamination from the stellar neighbor .",
    "we therefore conclude that the phase curve is of planetary origin .",
    "kepler-7b s phase curve deviates from a pure lambert - law phase - dependent behavior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) expected for isotropic scattering alone ( fig.[fig_kep ] , green ) .",
    "the main feature of kepler-7b s phase curve is a delay of @xmath31 hours of the phase - curve s peak from the occultation center .",
    "this delay implies that the hemisphere - integrated flux is maximum to the west of kepler-7b s substellar point .",
    "we further measure a phase - curve amplitude of @xmath32 ppm and an occultation depth of @xmath33 ppm , corresponding to a geometric albedo @xmath34 .",
    "this occultation depth translates to a brightness temperature of @xmath35k in the _ kepler _ bandpass , which is 1000k and 800k larger than the infrared brightness temperatures upper limits measured at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath8 m respectively ( see sect.[spitzer ] ) .",
    "we found our phase - curve amplitude and occultation depth to be in agreement with previous analyses ( d11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the key features of kepler-7b s phase - curve translate directly into constraints on maps @xcite assuming a tidally - locked planet on a circular orbit .",
    "a planetary phase - curve @xmath36 measures the planetary hemisphere - averaged relative brightness @xmath37 as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the orbital phase .",
    "we first notice that kepler-7b s planetary flux contribution starts from phase @xmath40 , when the meridian centered @xmath41 east of the substellar point appears .",
    "second , the phase - curve s maximum is located at phase @xmath42 , implying that the brightest hemisphere is centered on the meridian located @xmath43 west of the substellar point .",
    "third , the planetary flux contribution vanishes around the transit , implying that the `` bright '' area extends up to the western terminator , while its extension to the east of the substellar point is nominal .",
    "we finally note that the phase - curve s amplitude of @xmath32 ppm converts into an hemisphere - averaged relative brightness @xmath44 ( eq.[eq1 ] ) .",
    "we longitudinally map kepler-7b using the mcmc implementation presented in @xcite .",
    "this method has been developed to map exoplanets and to mitigate the degeneracy between the planetary brightness distribution and the system parameters .",
    "we use two model families similar to the `` beach - ball models '' introduced by @xcite : one using @xmath45 longitudinal bands with fixed positions on the dayside and another using longitudinal bands whose positions and widths are jump parameters in the mcmc fit .",
    "we choose the two simplest models from these families : a 3-fixed - band model and 1-free - band model so as to extract kepler-7b s longitudinal dependence of the dayside brightness as well as the extent of the `` bright '' area . for both models , we compute each band s amplitude from their simulated lightcurve by using a perturbed singular value decomposition method .",
    "the corresponding median brightness maps are shown on fig.[fig_kep2 ] .",
    "the 1-free - band model ( fig.[fig_kep ] , blue ) finds a uniformly - bright longitudinal area extending from @xmath46 west to @xmath47 east with a relative brightness @xmath48 ( fig.[fig_kep2 ] , left ) .",
    "the 3-fixed - band model ( fig.[fig_kep ] , red ) finds bands of relative brightness decreasing from the west to the east with the following values : 100 to 68 and 3@xmath49 ( fig.[fig_kep2 ] , right ) .",
    "we finally note that the 1-free - band model finds a bright sector extending to the night side , due to the sharp flux increase observed around transit ( fig.[fig_kep ] ) .",
    "the combined information from the _ spitzer _ and _ kepler _ observations of kepler-7b strongly favor the conclusion that the planetary phase - dependent flux variations seen in the _ kepler _ light curve are the result of scattered light from optically thick clouds , whose properties change as a function of longitude .",
    "the lack of significant thermal emission from kepler-7b in the _ spitzer _ 3.6 and 4.5-@xmath8 m bandpasses supports the fact that kepler-7b s visible light curve is driven by reflected light .",
    "s phase curve exhibits a westward asymmetry suggesting , if of thermal origin , a temperature structure that does not follow the expected temperature structure for tidally - locked hot jupiters , which would yield an eastward shift .",
    "this eastward shift is consistently produced from a range of general circulation models for tidally - locked hot - jupiters forced using various methods , including newtonian cooling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dual - band radiative transfer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or multi - wavelength radiative transfer ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . combining these results with the analytical theory of @xcite",
    "suggests that thermal phase - curve eastward shifts are robust outcomes of the hot - jupiter circulation regime . as we do not detect thermal flux from kepler-7b with _ spitzer _",
    ", the most likely conclusion is that the westward shift in the visible phase - curve is indicative of a variation in the cloud properties ( cloud coverage , optical depth , particle size distribution , vertical extent , composition , etc . ) as a function of longitude , governed by the planet s wind and thermal patterns .",
    "we use the methods of @xcite to compute kepler-7b s one - dimensional ( 1d ) temperature structure and emission spectrum ( fig.[jfpt ] ) .",
    "the orange model is cloud - free .",
    "the blue model uses the cloud model of @xcite to calculate the vertical distribution and optical depths of mg@xmath1sio@xmath50 clouds .",
    "both models assume modest redistribution of energy , with the assumption that 1/4 of the incident energy is lost to the un - modeled night side .",
    "the particle size distribution in the cloud is assumed to be log - normal with a mode of 0.5@xmath8 m at all heights .",
    "a low sedimentation efficiency free parameter ( @xmath51 ) of 0.1 is used , which suppresses sedimentation .",
    "it is clear that the cloudy model ( blue ) provides a much better fit to the combined occultation measurements from _ spitzer _ and _ kepler_. the clouds dramatically enhance the flux in the optical , increase the model bond albedo , and suppress emission in the infrared ( fig.[jfpt ] , right ) .",
    "we note that many other combinations of cloud and thermal properties might also provide an adequate match to the data .",
    "however , we exclude rayleigh scattering from h@xmath1 molecules and homogeneous cloud structures as possible sources of visible phase - curve signatures , which would both result in a symmetric phase curve .    kepler-7b may be relatively more likely to show the effects of cloud opacity than other hot jupiters .",
    "the planet s incident flux level is such that model profiles cross silicate condensation curves in the upper , observable atmosphere , making these clouds a possible explanation .",
    "the same would not be true for warmer planets ( where temperatures would be too hot for dayside clouds ) or for cooler planets ( where silicates would only be present in the deep unobservable atmosphere ) .",
    "furthermore , the planet s very low surface gravity may play an important role in hampering sedimentation of particles out the atmosphere . finally , the planet s large radius implies a relatively high specific entropy adiabatic in the interior , and a correspondingly warm adiabat in the deep atmosphere at tens of bars .",
    "this removes the possibility of silicate clouds condensing at pressures of 100 - 1000 bars , as may happen in other hot jupiters .",
    "our results suggest that one broad - band visible phase curve is probably insufficient to constrain the cloud properties",
    ". the problem might remain degenerate until more observations ( such as narrow - band optical phase curves and polarimetry ) become available . in the near future it is likely that similar brightness maps of other _ kepler _ planets will emerge , thereby providing an invaluable means to improve our understanding of cloud formation in exoplanet atmospheres .",
