    "the path - integral representation for the green function of a particle moving along a closed trajectory and interacting with the gauge field yields the wilson loop .",
    "when the particle is confined by the gauge field , its wilson loop obeys the area law . in this physically very important case",
    "the path integral can not be calculated analytically , because finding the minimal surface for an arbitrary contour @xmath0 in @xmath1 dimensions is too complicated .",
    "therefore , effective parametrizations of the minimal surface have been invented in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which means there exist certain physically motivated tricks to construct the minimal - area functional in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "to give an example we consider the following formula , which converts a double surface integral into line integrals with stokes theorem : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is an arbitrary function for which the integrals are finite , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is an arbitrary surface encircled by the contour @xmath6 . as one can see , the choice @xmath7 is the unique one , for which the derivatives on the l.h.s .",
    "( [ e ] ) are removed completely , and one obtains @xmath8 now , if @xmath6 is a flat contour , then we can choose @xmath5 flat as well , in which case the l.h.s .",
    "of this equation equals to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the area of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , for a flat contour , the minimal area reads @xmath11 is the so - called tensor area  @xcite , which is manifestly a functional of @xmath6 only .",
    "flat contours are a good approximation for particle trajectories when the particle is heavy .",
    "for example , the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ example ] ) reproduces correctly the heavy - quark condensate  @xcite and the mixed heavy - quark  gluon condensate  @xcite in qcd .",
    "however , it certainly can not be correct for a light particle , whose trajectory may deviate significantly from the flat one .",
    "a parametrization for light and even massless particles has been proposed in ref .",
    "similarly to eq .",
    "( [ example ] ) , it allows to express the area @xmath12 of the minimal surface @xmath5 in terms of a single integral .",
    "the main idea is to convert the proper time in the path integral to a length coordinate @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "after that , one can naturally parametrize @xmath12 as an integral of the transverse direction , @xmath14 , along this coordinate : @xmath15    with such a parametrization of @xmath12 , we calculate in this paper the polarization operator of a gluon when it splits into two valence gluons .",
    "the latter move in a nonperturbative background , which confines them . in the absence of the confining background ,",
    "the polarization operator yields the standard yang - mills one - loop running coupling  @xcite .",
    "in the presence of the background , the running coupling goes to a constant in the infrared region , i.e. its logarithmic growth `` freezes ''  @xcite : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the absolute value of the first coefficient of the yang - mills @xmath18-function , @xmath19 is a nonperturbative mass parameter .    in this paper , we will show how freezing occurs and calculate the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 both analytically and numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we recall the derivation of @xmath22 in the absence of the confining background , introducing the scalar polarization operator @xmath23 . in section  3 , the world - line integrals for the polarization operator @xmath24 in the coordinate representation are evaluated . in section  4 , freezing is discussed in detail . in section  5 , we extend this approach to the analysis of freezing in the deconfined phase . in section  6 ,",
    "possible phenomenological consequences of freezing are discussed .",
    "finally , the main results of the paper are summarized in conclusions .",
    "in this section , we recollect some steps of the derivation of @xmath22 based on the integration over quantum fluctuations of the yang - mills field  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure starts with splitting the total yang - mills field @xmath25 into a background , @xmath26 , and a quantum fluctuation , @xmath27 , whose momentum is larger than that of the background .",
    "one can therefore substitute the ansatz @xmath28 into the bare yang - mills action , @xmath29=\\frac{1}{4g_0 ^ 2}\\int d^4x(f_{\\mu\\nu}^a[a])^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 $ ] is the qcd field - strength tensor and @xmath31 the bare coupling .",
    "one separates @xmath25 into a slowly varying background field @xmath26 and fluctuations @xmath27 : @xmath32 fixing the so - called background feynman gauge @xmath33 , one adds to the action the term @xmath34 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath35 . the total gluon action reads @xmath36 @xmath37)^2 - 4a_\\nu^a(d_\\mu f_{\\mu\\nu}[\\bar a])^a-2a_\\mu^a\\left[\\delta_{\\mu\\nu } ( d^2)^{ac}+2f^{abc}f_{\\mu\\nu}^b[\\bar a]\\right]a_\\nu^c+{\\cal o}(a^3)\\right\\}.\\ ] ] to perform the one - loop renormalization of @xmath38 , one has to integrate out the @xmath27-gluons in the @xmath26-background .",
    "the full renormalized effective action can be written as @xmath39 where the running coupling @xmath40 is the object of the calculation .",

    "this effect leads to the screening of charge and is present in the abelian case as well .",
    "the subscript `` para '' is because this part of the effective action describes the paramagnetic interaction of the @xmath26-field with the spin of of the @xmath27-gluons .",
    "it leads to the antiscreening of charge , which is a specific property of the non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "the dia- and paramagnetic parts of the one - loop effective action can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the free scalar polarization operator .",
    "equation  ( [ fullaction ] ) then yields @xmath47 where @xmath48 . introducing the renormalized cutoff @xmath49 ,",
    "one finally arrives at the standard result @xmath50 .",
    "in reality , the gluon fluctuations @xmath27 s do not appear as measurable excitations in the qcd spectrum and therefore must be self - confined , which means that the two @xmath27-gluons propagating along the loop interact and form a colored bound state .",
    "this interaction has a one - gluon - exchange part plus a nonperturbative part , which may be related to string formation in the octet - octet channel coupled to a color octet .",
    "if one assumes casimir scaling for the string tension , the corresponding string tension in the octet channel is related to that of the fundamental representation as ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath51 with @xmath52 . the @xmath27-gluons may be confined because of a stochastic background field @xmath53 , whose momenta are even smaller than the momenta of the @xmath26-gluons  @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
