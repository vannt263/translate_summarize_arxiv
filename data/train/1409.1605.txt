    "in its quest to find habitable worlds , the _ kepler _ mission ( borucki et al .  2010 ; koch et al .  2010 ) has observed over 2600 eclipsing binary star systems .",
    "cataloged in pra et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , slawson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and kirk et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the vast majority of these are new systems discovered by _ kepler _ , and have orbital periods between 1.8 hours to 670 days . a sizeable fraction ( @xmath220 - 30% ) exhibit evidence for being triple or higher multiplicity stellar systems ( conroy et al .  2013 ; rappaport et al .  2013 ; gies , et al .  2012 ; orosz et al .  in prep ) .",
    "in addition , there is a rapidly growing subset where the third body is a planet rather than a star . beyond providing challenges to planet - formation theory ( e.g. kley & haghighipour 2014 ) , these circumbinary planets are particularly important because the orbital configurations and 3-body gravitational interactions allow direct and precise measurements of the mass and radius of the bodies . for example , in the kepler-34 system the relative uncertainties in the stellar masses and radii are less than 0.3% ( welsh et al .",
    "2012 ) ; for kepler-16 the uncertainties in the planet s mass and radius are 4.8% and 0.34% , respectively ( doyle et al . 2011 ) .    to date",
    ", nine _ transiting _ circumbinary planets have been discovered , residing in seven systems : kepler-16b ( doyle et al .  2011 ) , kepler-34b and 35 b ( welsh et al .",
    "2012 ) , kepler-38b ( orosz et al .",
    "2012b ) , kepler-47b and c ( orosz et al .",
    "2012a ) , kepler-64b ( schwamb et al .",
    "2013 and simultaneously kostov et al .",
    "2013 ) , kepler-413b ( kostov et al .",
    "2014 ) , and kepler-47d ( orosz , in prep ) .",
    "the transiting nature of these planets unambiguously confirms the presence of the third orbiting body .",
    "however , due to dynamical interactions , a transiting circumbinary planet may not always transit  in kepler-413 three transits were observed with a period of @xmath266 days , then for 800 days no transits were present , then five more transits were observed .",
    "this behavior is due to the 2.5 degree angle between the planet and binary orbital planes which , for kepler-413 , leads to precession with a period of only 11 years ( kostov et al .",
    "2014 ) .    in the following sections we present the discovery of the tenth _ kepler _ transiting circumbinary planet , kepler - nnnn ( kic  9632895 ) .",
    "the tight constraints placed on the relative positions , velocities , and sizes of the three bodies by the times , durations , and depths of the eclipses and transits allow very precise determinations of the geometric aspects of the system . as will be shown below",
    ", the uncertainty in the planet s radius is only 0.57% , and for the secondary star s radius it is 0.65% , making it one of the most precisely measured low - mass stars . like kepler-413 , this system also exhibits times when no transits are present during conjunctions of the planet with the binary . in ",
    "2 we present the observations , in  3 we detail the photodynamical modeling of the observations .",
    "we present the results in  4 and discuss the characteristics of the binary and the planet , the orbital dynamics and the long - term stability .",
    "we conclude with a section describing @xmath0-b s status as the third circumbinary planet in the habitable zone .",
    "identification of @xmath0 as a circumbinary planet candidate was made by visual inspection of a subset of the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary star light curves ( slawson et al .",
    "2011 ) , in particular , those with orbital periods greater than @xmath21 day that show both primary and secondary eclipses .",
    "once identified as a circumbinary planet candidate , the system was given the koi number 3151 , though this same system had previously been named koi-1451 and rejected as a false - positive ; thus koi-1451 is formally the correct koi number . because we identified the binary as a circumbinary planet candidate",
    ", the target was placed on short cadence ( @xmath21 min integration sampling ) starting in quarter 13 ( 2012 march 29 ) .",
    "the _ nexsci exoplanet archive _ lists for koi-1451 a _ kepler _ magnitude of 13.552 , temperature of @xmath4  k , and a surface gravity of @xmath5 , while the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) reports @xmath6  k and @xmath7 .",
    "note that in their study on the rate of occurrence of circumbinary planets , armstrong , et al .",
    "( 2014 ) independently identified kic  9632895 as a circumbinary planet candidate .",
    "the orbital period of the binary is 27.322 days and the depth of the primary eclipse is @xmath2 8% .",
    "the secondary eclipse is shallow , only @xmath8 , and flat - bottomed , indicating a total eclipse . since the primary eclipse is likely to be total ( i.e.  annular ) ,",
    "the depth of the eclipses tells us that the secondary star contributes only a small fraction to the total luminosity and is likely a low - mass small star .",
    "the upper panel of fig .  1 shows a one - year long section of the light curve , after normalizing each quarter with a simple cubic polynomial .",
    "the light curve exhibits quasi - periodic variations of @xmath20.5% on a timescale of tens of days , with the largest peak - to - peak variation being @xmath21.5% .",
    "the rms of the mildly detrended pdc - map light curve , after removing all the eclipses , is 0.22% .",
    "we interpret these modulations as being caused by starspots on the primary star .",
    "the lower panels of fig .  1 show a sample of eclipse events , all in short cadence , along with our best - fit model curve .",
    "the leftmost is a secondary eclipse , followed by a planet transit , then two primary eclipses .",
    "the time scale in each panel is identical and nicely demonstrates the much longer duration of the transit than that of the eclipses .",
    "the two primary eclipses are consecutive in time , yet the first shows a notable deviation in its residuals .",
    "this is the signature of a starspot on the primary star being occulted by the secondary star .",
    "such events are common , but are not readily visible in long cadence eclipse profiles .    fig .",
    "2 shows the phase - folded eclipse profiles , based on the long cadence _ kepler _",
    "observations that span 1470.5 days ( from times -46.5 to 1424.0 in bjd2,455,000 ) .",
    "the preliminary model fit to the binary star data only ( no planet included ) is generally excellent , though there is a marked increase in the scatter of the residuals for the primary eclipse .",
    "these are due to the secondary star covering starspots ( and possibly other features ) on the primary star .",
    "our elc photodynamical model , described in  3 , does not include starspots , thus the minimization of residuals leads to both high and low scatter .",
    "if we were to use this preliminary fit , we would need to correct for a bias in the model  the starspots should induce upward - only residuals , and as this is not the case , the model is too shallow compared to the true eclipse depth .",
    "it is important to note that the starspot - occultations lead not only to residuals in flux , but also to shifts in the measurements of the timing of the eclipses .",
    "we return to this point in  3 when describing our photodynamical modeling methodology .",
    "the center - of - eclipse times for the 49 primary and 50 secondary eclipses were measured in two ways : ( i ) by using the best - fit model eclipse profile ( described in  3 ) as a template and sliding it to best match the individual eclipses ; and ( ii ) using the technique described in steffen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and welsh et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which uses a template created from a polynomial fit to the folded eclipse profile .",
    "the results were very comparable , so we adopt the former method because it should be less - sensitive to starspot - induced deviations in the mean eclipse profile .",
    "the mean uncertainty is 6.8 seconds for the primary eclipses ( 7.6  s for the 34 long cadence eclipses , 4.3  s for the 12 short cadence eclipses ) .",
    "the shallowness of the secondary eclipses made their timing measurements much more difficult : the mean uncertainty is 117.3  s ( 123.5  s for the 37 long cadence eclipses , 99.7  s for the 13 short cadence eclipses ) .",
    "a linear ephemeris was derived from the eclipse times and a time series of observed minus computed ( @xmath9 ) values was made .",
    "when compared with the local slope of the light curve surrounding each primary eclipse , the @xmath9 times show a significant anti - correlation .",
    "this anti - correlation indicates that the spin of the star is prograde with respect to the binary orbit ( holczer et al .",
    "2014 ; see also sanchis - ojeda , et al .",
    "such behavior was also seen in kepler-47 ( orosz et al .",
    "2012a ) . using a linear fit to the primary star @xmath9 values versus the local slopes , the eclipse times",
    "were then statistically corrected for the starspot - induced timing shifts ; the uncertainties in the times were increased ( by @xmath210  s in quadrature ) to account for noise in this correction .",
    "the eclipse measurements made after date bjd2455000=1015 used short cadence observations , though because of the boosting of the uncertainties in the starspot correction , the error bars are similar to those of the long cadence @xmath9 .",
    "the secondary eclipse @xmath9 values were not correlated with their local slope , so no correction was made .",
    "a common linear ephemeris was then fit to both sets of eclipse times , and fig .",
    "3 shows the resulting @xmath9 diagram .",
    "the rms of the @xmath9 residuals is 10.1  s for the primary and 100.0  s for the secondary , and both appear consistent with noise .",
    "this indicates that the circumbinary object has no measurable gravitational effect on the binary , at least on a timescale of a few years .",
    "consequently , the object is of relatively low mass and only an upper limit on its mass can be robustly determined .",
    "the _ kepler _ simple aperture photometry `` sap '' data were used throughout this paper , with the exception of measuring the starspot modulation rms amplitude .",
    "the light curve was detrended and normalized using the method described in orosz et al .",
    "( in prep ) : windows around each eclipse event were kept and the rest of the light curve discarded .",
    "the windows were three times the width of the eclipse .",
    "data that were inside an eclipse were then masked , and for each window , a 5th order legendre polynomial was fit .",
    "the eclipse was then restored and the data normalized by dividing by the polynomial .",
    "any points with a _ kepler _ pipeline data quality flag greater than 16 ( indicative of some anomaly with the observation ) were omitted prior to the detrending .",
    "the mean combined differential photometric precision ( cdpp ) over a 3-hour baseline as reported on mast is 121 @xmath10 34 ppm .",
    "prior to the eclipse and transit fitting , the light curve was heavily detrended ( to minimize starspot effects ) and normalized .",
    "the rms scatter outside of the eclipse and transit events was measured to be 0.0159 % ( 159 ppm ) , consistent with the cdpp value , and was a factor of 1.17 times larger than the mean sap error bar .",
    "this difference suggests that either the sap error bars are slightly underestimated or there are additional high - frequency variations that the detrending did not remove .",
    "@xmath0 was observed from the mcdonald observatory with the high resolution spectrograph ( tull 1998 ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , and with the tull coude spectrograph @xcite on the the harlan j. smith 2.7  m telescope ( hjst ) .",
    "a total of 11 spectra were obtained in 2013 , spanning 47 nights .",
    "the hrs spectra cover a wavelength range from 4780 to 6800 at a resolving power of @xmath11 and a typical continuum signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of 40:1 at 5500  .",
    "the data taken with the tull spectrograph span the entire optical spectrum and have a resolving power of @xmath12 with a typical continuum s / n ratio around 20:1 at 5500  .",
    "we determined the rvs by cross - correlating the spectra with the rv standard star hd  182488 .",
    "eleven radial velocities were extracted ( note : a 0.185 zero - point offset was found between the two spectrographs ) . as expected from the light curve ,",
    "the secondary star is sufficiently faint that it was not detected in the spectra . by injecting a synthetic spectrum signal into the observed spectra and attempting to recover that signal ,",
    "an upper limit of @xmath2 4% was found for any non - primary star light .",
    "this upper limit is over an order of magnitude higher than the secondary star s light contribution estimated via the photodynamical modeling described in  3 , and therefore this is not valuable in determining the secondary star s flux contribution .",
    "however , it is interesting with regard to the presence of any contaminating third light .",
    "the radial velocities for the primary are listed in table  1 and the elc model fit (  3.1 ) is shown in fig .",
    "several independent spectral analyses were carried out using the higher signal - to - noise het spectra , including an spc ( stellar parameter classification ) analysis ( buchhave et al .",
    "2012 ) , an analysis similar to the one for koi-126 ( carter et al .  2011 ) , a moog - based analysis and by fitting a theoretical template to the spectrum ( tal - or et al .",
    "each gave similar results , with the best fit @xmath13 ranging from 5480 - 5620 k , and metalicity @xmath14 $ ] ranging from -0.10 to + 0.09 .",
    "the spectra have relatively low s / n ratio for this type of spectral analysis and the spc method has worked reliably on noisy data , hence we prefer its results : @xmath15  k , @xmath14 = + 0.09 \\pm 0.08 $ ] , and @xmath16 .",
    "this surface gravity measurement was guided , but not constrained by , the photodynamical modeling value of @xmath17 .",
    "the agreement in metallicity between methods was not as tight as for @xmath13 , thus we conservatively inflate the uncertainty in both metallicity and @xmath13 to @xmath18 and @xmath19 k , respectively .",
    "in addition , the projected stellar rotation velocity , @xmath20 , was measured to be 1.9 .",
    "based on the values retrieved from mast , the seasonal mean of the contamination for @xmath0 is 7.0 @xmath10 1% .",
    "such contamination will dilute the eclipse and transit depths and could significantly bias the inferred radii .",
    "therefore we undertook several direct imaging investigations to determine the amount of contamination .",
    "eighteen short exposures ( 10  s ) of the target were obtained in the sdss - r filter using the lcogt ( brown et al .",
    "2013 ) ftn 2 m robotic telescope in haleakala , hawaii over the span of 4 nights in 2012 march .",
    "the data were median - combined and provided an image with a fwhm of 1.70 arcsec . according to the kic",
    "there should be a @xmath21kp = 2.8 mag fainter star located 4.5 arcsec south of the target ( kid 9632896 ; g - r = 4.4 mag ) .",
    "this star was not detected , although fainter stars further away were clearly detected .",
    "the closest star to the target in the image is about 15 arcsec away and has r=18.3 mag according to the kic .",
    "that star is also the closest star to the target detected by the ubv survey of everett et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .    to better understand any photometric contamination due to non - target light captured in the _ kepler _ aperture , we observed @xmath0 through j , h and ks filters on the wiyn high - resolution infrared camera ( whirc  meixner et al .",
    "2010 ) at the kitt peak national observatory on 2013 oct 19 ut .",
    "we employed a standard five - point dithering pattern and 30  s exposure times in each filter .",
    "unfortunately the conditions were not photometric and the seeing was @xmath20.9 arcsec .",
    "we estimated detection limits in each filter following the procedure of adams et al .",
    "we used the idl aper routine to measure the contribution from the target s psf in non - overlapping , concentric annuli centered on the star .",
    "we define a detection limit as a 5-@xmath3 signal above the measured stellar psf background in each annulus .",
    "the innermost annulus in each filter is defined as the measured fwhm of the stellar psf .",
    "the detection limits are presented in table  2 .",
    "the expected nearby star kic 9632896 was again not detected .",
    "a star @xmath2 8.5 arcsec away toward the sw was detected in the j band ( and weakly in the h band and barely in the k band ) , with @xmath20.5% the brightness of @xmath0 .",
    "finally , an even deeper j - band observation was taken with ukirt as part of the j - band survey of the _ kepler _ field for the ukidds survey .",
    "the j - band detections were converted into expected _ kepler _ magnitudes via the transformations from howell et al .",
    "the missing kic star was again not detected .",
    "the star 8.5 arcsec away was detected ( expected kepmag=19.12 , based on the j - mag 17.64 observation ) , along with a very faint star 7.26 arcsec due south of @xmath0 , with an expected kepmag of 19.85 . in summary , the star reported as kic 9632896 was not detected , and no stars were detected that could contribute any significant contamination within the kepler aperture .",
    "though eclipsing , @xmath0 is a single - lined spectroscopic binary , which normally does not allow a full solution of the component masses .",
    "however , the precise times and durations of the planetary transits place strong constraints on the location and relative velocity of the primary star , which in turn constrains the mass ratio .",
    "additionally , the light - travel time effect further constrains the mass ratio .",
    "thus a full solution for the eclipsing binary is possible with a photodynamical model .",
    "an upgraded `` photodynamical '' version of the elc code ( orosz & hauschildt 2000 ) was developed .",
    "the upgrade allows for dynamics , instead of keplerian kinematics , by integrating the newtonian equations of motion under the assumption of point - masses and newtonian gravity .",
    "a 12@xmath22 order gaussian runga - kutta symplectic integrator , based on the code of e.  hairer and m.   hairer ( 2003 ) is used .",
    "transits and eclipses are modeled using the prescription of mandel & agol ( 2002 ) , replacing the gimenez method ( gimenez 2006 ) formerly used in elc .",
    "quadratic limb darkening is used , following the method of kipping ( 2013 ) , which more naturally handles correlation and limits on the coefficients .",
    "a total of 26 parameters are specified in the model : the five standard keplerian orbital parameters for each orbit ( @xmath23 ) , the three masses , the three radii , the stellar temperature ratio , two quadratic limb darkening coefficients for each star , the longitudinal nodal angle @xmath24 of the planet s orbit , and four seasonal contamination levels .",
    "since the keplerian parameters evolve rapidly with time , their values presented in table  3 are instantaneous `` osculating '' values valid at the reference epoch . in particular ,",
    "the time of conjunction , @xmath25 , is the time of conjunction of the body and the barycenter ; for the binary this is approximately a primary mid - eclipse time , but for the planet it need not be close to an actual transit .",
    "furthermore , while this fiducial time serves to set the position of the planet in its orbit _ at the reference epoch _ , it does not accurately define the planet s position when the model is integrated away from the reference time . to faithfully reproduce our solution the instantaneous positions and velocities given in table  4 should be used .",
    "although the nodal longitude of the binary is not measurable with our data , it must be specified ; we set the angle to be zero . in the actual fitting , ratios and other combinations of parameters",
    "are often more robustly constrained by the data , e.g. mass ratios , semi - major axis / radius , temperature ratio , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , and these are therefore used .",
    "both a genetic algorithm and a markov chain monte carlo optimization was used to explore parameter space and find the least - squares best solution , along with the uncertainties , defined as the interval for which the @xmath28 is less than the minimum @xmath29 for each marginalized parameter .",
    "we initially fit the normalized and detrended _ kepler",
    "_ long cadence light curve plus the 11 radial velocity values . because the normalized flat sections of the light curve far from any eclipse or transit contain no information on the system parameters , they were omitted from the fitting process .",
    "the uncertainties in the _ kepler _ data were increased to account for additional `` noise '' that occurs when a starspot is eclipsed ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "an increase of 1.44 was chosen to give a reduced @xmath30 , based on a preliminary model fit to the eclipses .",
    "our initial fit was acceptable , yielding a @xmath28 of 11,114.6 for 11,139 data points .",
    "however , we found the results unsatisfactory for the following reason : the best fit estimate for the mass of the planet was tightly constrained to zero mass .",
    "when the non - negative mass constraint was lifted , the preferred solution fell to roughly @xmath31 , at an unnerving 3-@xmath3 confidence .",
    "three scenarios were considered to explain this non - physical result , keeping in mind that any constraint on the mass of the planet arises from the perturbation the planet induces on the binary , which would be manifest most readily in the eclipse timing variations ( etvs ) .    the first scenario presumed that the binary apsidal motion was not being calculated sufficienly well in the model , and the disagreement between the predicted and measured divergence in the @xmath9 diagram was leading to the non - physical mass . for the separation and radii of the stars , classical apsidal motion due to tides",
    "was found to be negligible , but the precession caused by general relativity ( gr ) was potentially signicant .",
    "this led to the inclusion of a gr correction in the model ( mardling & lin 2002 ; see also ragozzine & wolf 2009 and hilditch 2001 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath9 of the etvs is essentially flat , and the inclusion of gr increases the apsidal motion rate , thus having the effect of nudging the planet s mass lower .",
    "the amplitude of the effect is nearly negligible however .",
    "nevertheless , gr is included as a necessary component for a more realistic model .",
    "the second scenario was based on the premise that the starspots on the primary were affecting the times of the primary eclipses .",
    "spurious correlated variations in the etv could mimic the effect of a negative mass planet .",
    "this led us to re - measure the eclipse times using a different method and more carefully correct for the starspot - induced variations ( see mazeh , holczer , shporer 2014 ) .",
    "the re - measurements were very similar to the original values , giving us more confidence in their validity .",
    "nevertheless , the correlation between the etvs and the local light curve slope indicates that starspots are affecting the eclipse times . the first short cadence primary eclipse shown in fig .  1 illustrates this very well .",
    "thus the primary eclipses are `` contaminated '' with noise due to starspot occultations , and their reliability is less than ideal . to mitigate this problem , we chose to fit only three primary and secondary eclipses that showed very clean residuals .",
    "these short cadence data are shown in fig .",
    "5 . with the superb _ kepler _ photometry ,",
    "these six eclipses are sufficient to measure all the geometric binary system parameters .",
    "to capture the effect of the planet on the binary ( the only way to measure its mass in this single - planet system ) , we include as part of the data all the eclipse times .",
    "the model is then penalized in a @xmath28 sense if its predicted eclipse times do not match the observed eclipse times .",
    "( the same 1.44 boost factor on the _ kepler _ sap error bars was maintained , for both the long and short cadence . ) as with the radial velocity observations , the eclipse times were given equal weight per point as the photometric data , i.e. , no regularization of the different data sets were enforced . with this new strategy for modeling the data , the dynamical constraints in the data",
    "are preserved , even though the individual eclipses are not fit .",
    "the key advantage of this method is that _ it uses primary eclipse times that have been corrected for the effect of starspots . _",
    "the individual eclipse profiles can not be corrected for the effect of starspots without employing a prohibitively computationally - expensive evolving - starspot model , requiring at least a dozen additional free parameters for even a rather simple two - starspot characterization ( i.e , starspot latitudes , longitudes , radii , temperatures , onset times , lifetimes , etc . ) and so , using this strategy , our photodynamical model now prefers a much larger mass for the planet , and while the mass is still close to zero , the uncertainty is @xmath1016 @xmath32 , a much more plausible result .",
    "this is the methodology and solution we adopt .    for completeness",
    "we briefly mention the third scenario we considered , which was the inclusion of a possible second planet external to the observed one . naturally , the freedom such a model allows provided a much better match to the observations  formally an improvement of 100 in @xmath28 when fitting to all of the eclipses .",
    "both planets had small but positive mass ( uncertainty of a few @xmath32 ) , and the period of the hypothetical second planet was @xmath2404 days  interesting if true , as this is a period ratio of 1.68 , which is a 5:3 ratio .",
    "however , we discard the second planet hypothesis because when using only the eclipse times and three clean eclipses as discussed above , the improvement is only 3.3 in @xmath28 , far from being significant when the additional 7 free parameters are taken into account      using the short cadence data when possible , there are 18,472 _ kepler _ photometric data points , plus 11 radial velocities and 96 eclipse times . as evident in fig .  1 , 4 , 5 and 6",
    ", the elc photodynamical model provides a good fit to the eclipse profiles , times of eclipse , radial velocities , and transits .",
    "formally , the model fit yields a @xmath33 of 18725.9 , or a reduced @xmath33 of 1.0093 .",
    "in particular , the model matches the transit timing variations ( ttvs ) and the transit duration variations ( tdvs ) .",
    "the time interval between the first two transits is 237.35 days , while the interval between the second and third transits is 235.56 days .",
    "the variation in transit duration is even more extreme , changing from 5.7 hours to 12.5 hours ( see fig .",
    "table  5 lists the observed transit times , durations , and depths , and the predicted values from the photodynamical model .",
    "the large ttvs and the more than a factor of two difference in the duration of the transit are due to the `` moving target '' effect  the motion of the primary star about the barycenter .",
    "thus the ttvs and tdvs follow well - defined curves as functions of the orbital phase of the binary and constitute an unambiguous signal of a circumbinary object , as no known false positive can reproduce this effect .",
    "this `` smoking gun '' signature will remain approximately true even in the presence of additional planets .",
    "however , if the transiting planet s orbit is significantly tilted with respect to the binary s orbit , the precession timescale may be sufficiently short that the changing impact parameter will alter the transit durations . in some cases , such as in kepler-413 , and now also in @xmath0 , the orbit precesses such that a large fraction of the time the planet does not transit the primary .",
    "we return to this topic in  4.3 .",
    "finally , the parameters from the photodynamical solution were input into the photodynam code of josh carter that was used to model the previous _ kepler _ circumbinary planets ( carter et al .  2011 ; pl 2012 ) and yielded good matches to the light curve .",
    "in addition , another completely independent photodynamical code developed by one of us ( smm ) , has been used to test and confirm the validity of the elc code .",
    "while the circumbinary configuration can in principle allow very accurate and precise estimates of the masses and radii of the three bodies , for @xmath0 the secondary star s radial velocity is not measured and there are only three planetary transits across the primary and none across the secondary .",
    "( the secondary star is so faint compared to the primary that transits over the secondary would not be detectable with these _ kepler _ data ; one such unseen transit did occur near date bjd2,455,000 = 548.974 ) the reflected light from the planet is far too feeble to allow the detection of any occultations . and the planet does not noticeably perturb the binary , thus its mass can only be constrained by limits on the eclipse timing variations , light travel time effects , precession timescales , and stability arguments , all of which are subtle . however , the phasing of the three transits is excellent , covering nearly the minimum to maximum possible duration and , importantly , there are three conjunctions where there is no observed transit .",
    "the _ lack _ of these three transits is itself an important constraint .",
    "while elc prefers a near zero - mass planet , the uncertainty of 16 @xmath32 means that an anomalously low mass ( and density ) planet is not required .",

    "the elc model provides a temperature ratio of @xmath38=0.599 , which , combined with the spectroscopically measured t@xmath39 of 5527  k for the primary , gives a @xmath40 of 3309 k for the secondary star .",
    "dartmouth stellar evolution models ( dotter et al .  2008 ) were compared with the measured mass , radius , temperature and metallicity of the stars ( we are assuming no alpha - element enhancement ) , and the results are shown in fig .  7 , in the form of a radius versus mass diagram .",
    "the best - matching isochrone was found by minimizing the distance between the observed value and the interpolated isochrones.``distance '' is defined as the quadrature sum of the uncertainty - normalized deviations between the isochrone and the observed masses , radii , and temperatures , for a fixed metalicity .",
    "three isochrones are shown in fig .  7 : the first is a match to the primary star only ( solid curve ) for a [ fe / h]=0.09 , which is the best estimate of the star s metallicity .",
    "this isochrone has a best temperature of 5429 k , and an age of 1.0 gyrs .",
    "the dashed curve is a match to both the primary and secondary stars for the same metallicity , and has temperatures of 5427 k and 3239 k for the primary and secondary stars , and an age of 2.0 gyrs .",
    "the secondary star is very slightly above these isochrones , though well within 1-@xmath3 , but this desire to have a larger radius has the effect of `` pulling '' the isochrone above the primary star s position .",
    "the third isochrone , shown as the dotted line , is a match to the primary only , now with [ fe / h]=0.0 .",
    "its age is 1.25 gyrs , and its temperatures is 5501  k , a better match than the [ fe / h]=0.09 case .",
    "however , while its mass and radius are an excellent match to the primary , it under - predicts the radius of the secondary . this might be a manifestation of the common problem of low - mass stars being too large and too cool compared to stellar models ( see e.g.  torres 2013 ) .",
    "additional exploration of isochrones for a spread of metalicities showed that ages up to 2.5 gyrs can reasonably match the observations .",
    "we also compared yonsei - yale isochrones ( yi et al .",
    "2001 ) with the primary star s observed mass , radius , and temperature , and found essentially the same results . to summarize , we can well - match the characteristics of the two stars with isochrones of age 1.0 - 2.5 gyrs .",
    "the modulation in the light curve caused by starspots allows the rotation period of the primary star to be measured . using the autocorrelation function ( acf ) method of mcquillan et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the rotation period is 20.31 @xmath10 0.47 d. we also visually inspected and computed the acf for individual quarters to be sure that the true period was not half or twice this value . in comparison ,",
    "the orbital period is 27.32 d , and the pseudosynchronous rotation period ( hut 1981 , 1982 ) for the mild eccentricity of the orbit @xmath41=0.051 , is 26.90 d. thus the star s rotation is not close to being synchronized with its orbit , though this is not unexpected given the relatively large orbital period . because the spin should synchronize much sooner than the orbits should circularize ( at least in a 2-body system ) , the system is likely to have been born with a low eccentricity .",
    "the predicted @xmath20 using the measured spin period and stellar radius , and assuming the spin inclination is aligned with the binary orbit inclination , is 2.08 .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed low projected rotation velocity of the star 1.9 @xmath10 1.0 .",
    "walkowics & basri ( 2013 ) report an age of 2.31 gyrs for @xmath0 , based on their measured rotation period of 19.98  d which was determined via a lomb - scargle periodogram . using our acf - derived rotation period and the b - v color index ( corrected for reddening ) , we used five different gyrochronology relations and found age estimates spanning 2.11 to 2.87 gyrs ( barnes 2007 , mamajek & hillenbrand 2008 , meibom et al .",
    "2009 , barnes 2010 , and epstein & pinsonneault 2014 ) .",
    "these ages are on the high end of the nominal isochrone age range , but they should be regarded more as upper limits because the star may have been influenced by tidal interactions in the binary , which are very slowly driving the spin period to match the binary orbital period of 27.32 d. thus the gyrochronology age estimates are in fairly good agreement with our isochrone age estimate .    finally , the observed @xmath20.22% rms fluctuations in the light curve is slightly smaller than the solar value ( @xmath20.3% ) , suggesting an older , rather than younger , age . the ca  ii h & k lines were not within the wavelength range of the het spectra , and were too faint in the tull spectra , so they could not be used as an activity or age indicator . the lack of any emission cores and the lack of the lithium 6708    absorption line rules out a very young age .",
    "the ability to precisely measure the stellar masses and radii , especially for the low mass secondary star , and the mass ratio of @xmath42 , make the binary worthy of a more thorough investigation in its own right .      while the radius of @xmath0  b is well determined at @xmath43 , we can not reliably estimate its mass since it has no measurable effect on the binary during the course of our observations . if the planet was sufficiently massive , it would cause periodic changes in the binary eclipse times ( etvs ) on roughly half the orbital period of the planet . and",
    "if the planet s orbit was not coplanar , it would cause a precession of the binary orbit ( though measurable only if the binary orbit had nonzero eccentricity ) .",
    "this precession would be most readily detectable via a difference in the orbital periods of the primary and secondary stars , i.e. , a divergence in the common - period @xmath9 diagram .",
    "finally , a periodic change in the orbital inclination of the binary could lead to slight changes in the primary eclipse depth . as none of these",
    "are seen in the _ kepler _ photometry , we are only able to estimate an upper limit on the mass , via the following ways .",
    "first , the photodynamical model fits place a 1-@xmath3 value of @xmath216 @xmath32 .",
    "second , we can attempt to match the observed etvs , both in their point - to - point fluctuations and in the long - term divergence between primary and secondary periods . however , there is little correlation between the observed primary eclipse timings and the expected etv signal that would be induced by a planet of any mass . nor is there any measurable difference in period ( mainly because of the noisy secondary star eclipse times ) .",
    "these lead to a best - fit mass near zero .",
    "the observed 1-@xmath3 upper limit on the difference in primary and secondary eclipse periods is 1.7  s , which leads to an upper mass estimate of @xmath44 , but with a large uncertainty of @xmath45 .",
    "finally , for completeness , a limit based on the light - travel time effect with a phase consistent with the orbit of the planet gives a weak upper limit of @xmath2 17 @xmath46 .",
    "we can compare the above mass estimates / limits to the empirically expected mass , based on the radius of the planet .",
    "several mass - radius relations have been published : lissauer et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , kane & gelino ( 2012 ) , enoch et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , weiss et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , wu & lithwick ( 2013 ) , and weiss & marcy ( 2014 ) . assuming that these relations are applicable to circumbinary planets , the mass and radius pairs that fall within the range of validity of these relations span @xmath2 1743 @xmath32 .",
    "these masses are larger than what the elc model or etv analysis prefers , though not inconsistent with the upper limits . given the systematic uncertainties in the empirical relations , the agreement is reasonably good .",
    "taking 32 @xmath32 as a 2-@xmath3 upper mass estimate , the mean density is then smaller than 0.75 @xmath47 with 95% confidence .",
    "if the mass is truly lower than 16 @xmath32 , then the density is @xmath48 and @xmath0 is an unusual low - mass and low - density planet .",
    "the photodynamical model predicts the planet s ( sky - projected ) inclination oscillates with a 102.8 year period , which is also the precession period of the planet s orbit . for the best - fit solution , the planet s inclination",
    "varies by 4.575 deg .",
    "conservation of angular momentum requires the binary s orbital plane to also oscillate , but with a miniscule @xmath49 deg amplitude  which is not surprising as the best - fit planet mass is near zero .",
    "8 illustrates the geometry of the binary and a spatial view of the rapid precession of the planet s orbit .    as a consequence of this changing inclination of the planet s orbit ,",
    "the impact parameter of the planet will vary by a large amount ; over a fairly short timescale the planet prcessed from non - transiting to transiting , then will become non - transiting again . in these _ kepler _ data the planet transits 50% of the time : three non - transits followed by three transits . however , this was very fortuitous  due to the relatively large mutual inclination between the orbital planes , the majority of the time the planet does not transit the star at conjunction .",
    "transits only occur when the impact parameter , defined as the minimum projected distance of the planet s _ limb _ from the center of the primary star during conjunction , relative to the radius of the primary , is less than unity .",
    "this occurs only 8.4% @xmath10 0.2% of the time . in fig .",
    "9 we show explicitly the sinusoidal oscillation of the planet s orbital inclination , along with the mutual inclination , and the evolution of the planet s impact parameter across the primary star .",
    "an interesting and important implication is that because of observational duration limitations , for every system like @xmath0 we see , there are @xmath212 similar systems that we do not see .",
    "the importance of binary - induced planetary orbital precession in determining circumbinary transit probabilities was foreseen by the prescient schneider ( 1994 ) .",
    "in addition to the observed transit times , durations , and depths , table  5 includes predicted near - future transit times .",
    "the near - future timescale is by necessity  we predict the transits will stop being visible after 2015 july and not return until 2066 .",
    "following dvorak ( 1986 ) and holman & wiegert ( 1999 ) , we calculated the orbital period where the planet is highly susceptible to a dynamical instability . with its orbital period 8.80 times the binary period ,",
    "@xmath0  b is comfortably above the critical period for circumbinary instability : @xmath50 . unlike previous _",
    "circumbinary planets , @xmath0  b is not skirting on the edge of the instability .",
    "note : we have found an error in previously reported values for @xmath51 for kepler 34 , 35 ( welsh et al .",
    "2012 ) and 38 ( orosz et al .",
    "the reported values , 1.21 , 1.24 , and 1.42 should be 1.49 , 1.34 , and 1.30 .",
    "the above analysis suggests that the orbit of @xmath0 b is dynamically stable . however , it is important to note that this critical stability limit was derived assuming the planet has negligible mass compared to the binary , and is initially on a circular and _ coplanar _ orbit .",
    "the perturbing effect of the planet on the dynamics of the binary is ignored .",
    "so to truly examine the long - term stability of the orbit of the planet , one has to integrate the equations of motion of the three - body system .",
    "we first investigated the stability of the planet by applying the megno ( mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits ) criterion ( see cincotta & simo 1999 , 2000 ; godziewski , et al .",
    "2001 ; godziewski & maciejewski 2001 ; and hinse et al .",
    "megno is used to determine general regions of dynamical instability , chaotic zones , and the locations of orbital resonances .",
    "10 shows the result of computing the megno factor over a grid of the test planet s initial semi - major axis and eccentricity .",
    "all other orbital parameters are fixed and taken as the best - fit elc values in table  3 .",
    "each of the 240,000 pixels in the map was integrated for @xmath218,500 binary periods ( 500,000 days ) .",
    "the color coding corresponds to the degree to which the orbit of the test planet is chaotic ( yellow ) or quasi - periodic ( blue ) .",
    "the location of the planet s best - fit osculating keplerian semi - major axis and eccentricity ( from table  3 ) is marked with the black dot .",
    "the megno map shows that the planet orbit resides in a region of phase space that is not chaotic for at least the @xmath21370 yr duration of the megno integration .",
    "note that the yellow instability gaps dipping into the blue region of the map correspond to n:1 mean - motion resonances between the planet and the binary orbit .",
    "these resonances play an important role in establishing the final orbit of the planet during its migration from outer regions of the disk where it is presumably formed ( kley & haghighipour 2014 ) .",
    "to better determine the long - term stability of the planet , we integrated the orbits of the three - body system for 100 kyrs ( 365 million days ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "as expected , the variations in the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the planet are negligibly small over the course of the integration , demonstrating that the orbit of the planet is stable on at least this timescale .",
    "the long - term integrations also show that the mutual inclination between the planet and the binary is not caused by the gravitational interactions , i.e. , it is a `` free '' inclination that is presumably primordial ( tides are unable to significantly modify this inclination ) .",
    "similarly , as mentioned before , the eccentricity of the binary is also likely primordial .",
    "the planet s eccentricity is dominated by the forcing of the binary , but there is a free eccentricity component as well ( see leung & lee 2012 ) .",
    "the habitable zone ( hz ) around a binary star is neither spherical nor fixed  it revolves with the binary .",
    "nevertheless , time - averaged approximations are useful for a preliminary investigation of the orbit of the planet with respect to its location in the habitable zone . in this approximation",
    ", we use the _ time - averaged _ distance of bodies in elliptical keplerian orbits ( see williams 2003 ) .",
    "we also ignored the secondary star s flux contribution since it emits less than @xmath20.3% of the light in the _ kepler _ bandpass . using @xmath40 of 5527 k for the primary star and @xmath40 of 3309 k for the secondary star ,",
    "the secondary emits 0.85% of the bolometric luminosity . assuming a bond albedo of 0.34 , appropriate for both the gas giant planets in our solar system and for the earth itself , and assuming re - emission over a full sphere , we find the planet s",
    "@xmath52 = 247 k and the time - averaged insolation to be s = 0.94 in sun - earth units .",
    "this is within the conservative hz limits defined by the runaway and maximum greenhouse criteria for the inner and outer boundaries . even at the most extreme ranges of star - planet separation due to the eccentricity",
    ", @xmath52 only varies between 237  k and 259  k.    we also calculated the properties of the hz using the more detailed methodology presented by haghighipour & kaltenegger ( 2013 ) and the multiple star hz calculator ( mueller & haghighipour 2014 ) . the results are presented in fig .  12 , where the dark green region corresponds to the narrow ( conservative ) hz and the light green corresponds to the nominal ( extended ) hz as defined by kopparapu et al .  ( 2013a , b , with coefficients updated on - line in 2014 ) .",
    "the dashed circle represent the dynamical stability limit .",
    "we then computed the instantaneous insolation using our photodynamical model , which gave a mean insolation over one full precession cycle of 0.958 s. fig .",
    "13 shows this varying insolation incident upon the planet from both stars as a function of time .",
    "the most obvious variation is due to the orbital motion of the primary star .",
    "superposed on this is the variation due to the eccentric orbit of the planet .",
    "finally , on a @xmath2103 year timescale , the effects of the oscillation of the mutual inclination are apparent .",
    "the overall fluctuation in insolation is 8.2% ( rms ) about the mean .",
    "interestingly , from the perspective of the planet , not every stellar conjunction is seen as an eclipse .",
    "this is due to the mutual inclination of the orbits .",
    "only when the planet crosses the plane of the binary ( i.e.  near the nodal points ) will an eclipse be seen from the planet . since the ratio of orbital periods is 8.8025 , and there are two nodal crossings per orbit ,",
    "the eclipses are visible every @xmath24.4 binary periods , but varies slightly with the oscillation of the mutual inclination .",
    "although @xmath0  b is a 6-size planet and itself unlikely to harbor conditions suitable for life , such a planet could host a large moon capable of sustaining life .",
    "since no evidence for such a moon is apparent we do not pursue this further , except to mention that in general , the effect noted by mason et al .",
    "( 2013 ) should be considered : in a binary , tides can significantly change the spin evolution  and thus the activity  of the stars , rendering the system more , or less , habitable depending on the specifics of the binary .",
    "other than the outer planets of the kepler-47 system , all transiting _ kepler _ circumbinary planets fall within a factor of 2 of the critical radius for instability . as remarked upon in orosz et al .",
    "( 2012b ) , whether this is a selection effect or not , the observed close - t@xmath9ritical orbits have an interesting consequence : the _ kepler _ circumbinary planets tend to lie close to their hz . both kepler-16 b and kepler-47 c",
    "are in the hz .",
    "@xmath0  b now joins this group of hz circumbinary planets , and currently 3 out of 10 _ kepler _ circumbinary systems reside in the hz .",
    "thus , although difficult to detect because of their large variations in transit timing and duration , the search for smaller earth - size planets in circumbinary environments is a particularly exciting endeavor .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> we present the discovery of @xmath0b , a 6.2 -radius planet in a low - eccentricity , 240.5-day orbit about an eclipsing binary . </S>",
    "<S> the binary itself consists of a 0.93 and @xmath1  pair of stars with an orbital period of 27.3 days . </S>",
    "<S> the plane of the planet s orbit is rapidly precessing , and its inclination only becomes sufficiently aligned with the primary star in the latter portion of the _ kepler _ data . </S>",
    "<S> thus three transits are present in the latter half of the light curve , but none of the three conjunctions that occurred during the first half of the light curve produced transits . </S>",
    "<S> the precession period is @xmath2103 years , and during that cycle , transits are visible only @xmath28% of the time . </S>",
    "<S> this has the important implication that for every system like @xmath0 that we detect , there are @xmath212 circumbinary systems that exist but are not currently exhibiting transits . </S>",
    "<S> the planet s mass is too small to noticeably perturb the binary , consequently its mass is not measurable with these data ; but our photodynamical model places a 1-@xmath3 upper limit of 16 . with a period 8.8 times that of the binary , the planet is well outside the dynamical instability zone . </S>",
    "<S> it does , however , lie within the habitable zone of the binary , and making it the third of ten _ kepler _ circumbinary planets to do so . </S>"
