    "in a recent paper @xcite , we reported finding the us economy to be predominantly in a low - volatility phase ( which corresponds roughly to the standard economic growth phase ) and a high - volatility phase ( which has a significantly longer duration than the economic contraction phase it incorporates ) , when we perform statistical segmentation and clustering analysis on the dow jones industrial average time series between 1997 and 2008 .",
    "both phases are interrupted by moderate - volatility market correction phases , which come with two typical durations : 12 weeks , and 1.52 months .",
    "the high - volatility phase is also frequently interrupted by very - high - volatility market crash phases , which can go from 1 day to 3 weeks in duration .",
    "more interestingly , the temporal distribution of the clustered segments suggests that the us economy made a transition from the low - volatility phase to the high - volatility phase in mid-1998 ( apparently triggered by the july 1997 asian financial crisis ) , went back into the low - volatility phase in mid-2003 , before entering the high - volatility phase again in mid-2007 ( the current global financial crisis , apparently triggered by market corrections in the chinese markets that started in mid-2006 ) .",
    "having extracted such a rich and exciting story of the us economy through segmentation and clustering analysis of a single index time series , we naturally wondered what we would find if we do a comparative study of the clustered segments for time series data from the various us economic sectors .",
    "in particular , we were inclined to believe that such a comparative analysis offers the potential to understand causal relationships between different components of the us economy .",
    "thus far , many fingers point ( with hindsight ) to the complex , poorly managed , poorly regulated interactions between the us property and financials sectors as the root cause of the present financial crisis . however , this stating of what is apparent on the surface  less an understanding of the concomitant subtleties beneath the surface  may not be enough to help us prevent the next financial crisis , nor is it likely to show us how to develop effective mitigation measures should one arise .",
    "if we fully comprehend the causal linkages between the various economic sectors , we imagine it would be possible to devise flexible and effective policies that would target key industries and sectors to accelerate recovery from a financial crisis , or to soften the impact ( or avert altogether ) the onset of a financial crisis .        in this paper , we report intriguing results that emerge from our segmentation and clustering analysis of the ten dow jones us economic sector time series .",
    "the varying temporal distributions of clustered segments tells us that the last us financial crisis was led to a large extent by the technologies sector , while the present global financial crisis was led by the non - cyclical consumer goods ( within which we find the homebuilders and realties ) and utilities sectors .",
    "moreover , we found what we believe might be a generic pattern : the sector that led the economy into decline recovers last , while the last sector to succumb to the financial crisis is also the first to recover when the economy ` picks up ' .",
    "other robust statistical signatures extracted include the leading sectors experiencing stronger and longer high - volatility shocks , while the trailing sectors experience weaker and shorter high - volatility shocks .",
    "these observations are consistent with the causal tree analogy shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : causaltree ] . in this analogy ,",
    "exogeneous factors shake the root of the tree , and branches closest to the root are the first to respond . as the influence of the exogeneous shock propagates up the tree ,",
    "the amplitudes of the shocks experienced by the sectors decrease in strength .",
    "another natural implication of this analogy is that the delay between successive sectors will be shorter if they are more closely related .",
    "because of its apparent utility , we will interpret our results within the framework of this analogy .    to facilitate easy navigation of our methods and results ,",
    "this paper is organized into six sections . in section [",
    "sect : datamethods ] , we briefly describe the data sets used , as well as the segmentation and clustering procedures . in section [ sect : generalfeatures ] , we describe general features observed in the ten temporal distributions of clustered segments , how we determine the sequence of recovery in the us economic sectors , as well as the sequence leading into the current global financial crisis . in section [",
    "sect : shockbyshock ] , we discuss an in - depth shock - by - shock causal - link analysis of the dynamics of the ten us economic sectors , in the period leading up to full economic recovery , as well as the start of the subprime crisis . in section [",
    "sect : interestratecuts ] , we present results on the present financial crisis , showing how the economy responded positively to the first few interest rate cuts , negatively to the next few rate cuts , and then not at all to subsequent rate cuts .",
    "this suggests that the federal reserve interest rate is not a universal knob that can be continuously adjusted to fine tune the economy , but can be good medicine if used sparingly .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section [ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "tic - by - tic data for the ten dow jones us economic sector indices ( see table [ table : djus ] ) over the period 14 february 2000 to 31 august 2008 were downloaded from the taqtic database @xcite .",
    "there are about three million tic - by - tic records for each index , and the format of this raw data is shown in table [ table : raw ] .",
    "these were processed into half - hourly time series @xmath0 , where @xmath1 index the various economic sectors according to table [ table : djus ] , and @xmath2 indicate which half - hour within the period of study the indices are sampled .",
    "for example , in table [ table : raw ] we see for bm that there was a transaction on february 14 , 2000 at 14:25:50.259 gmt , at index value 149.92 .",
    "the next transaction was on february 14 , 2000 at 14:30:29.829 gmt , at index value 149.93 .",
    "therefore , we take the index value for bm on february 14 , 2000 at 14:30:00 gmt , which is the opening time of the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) , to be 149.92 , i.e. the index value of the last transaction before 14:30:00 gmt . similarly , the half - hourly index values for 15:00:00 gmt , 15:30:00 gmt ,  , 20:30:00 gmt , up till the closing time 21:00:00 gmt of the nyse ,",
    "are taken to be the index values of the last transactions before these half hours . in the raw data",
    ", we also see records of transactions several minutes after the closing time , and once in a while , we will see transactions an hour to two hours before the opening time .",
    "records before the opening time are corrections made by the nyse .",
    "these are not real transactions so we ignore such entries .",
    "records after the closing time are real transactions , with index values that can be about 0.1% different from that of the last transaction before the official closing time .",
    "this last - minute rush in stock markets is well known .",
    "we also ignore these records , because their index values will generally be very close to the index values we assign to the opening hours .",
    "finally , the list of half hours is also adjusted to take into account daylight saving . in the end , we obtained from the tic - by - tic records index values for 31560 half hours for each economic sector .",
    ".the ten dow jones us economic sector indices as defined by the industry classification benchmark ( icb )",
    ". these are float - adjusted market capitalization weighted sums of variable numbers of component stocks , introduced on february 14 , 2000 to measure the performance of us stocks in the ten icb industries .",

    "<S> in this paper , we perform a comparative segmentation and clustering analysis of the time series for the ten dow jones us economic sector indices between 14 february 2000 and 31 august 2008 . from the temporal distributions of clustered segments , we find that the us economy took one and a half years to recover from the mid-1998-to - mid-2003 financial crisis , but only two months to completely enter the present financial crisis . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the oil & gas and basic materials sectors leading the recovery from the previous financial crisis , while the consumer goods and utilities sectors led the descent into the present financial crisis . on a macroscopic level , we find sectors going earlier into a crisis emerge later from it , whereas sectors going later into the crisis emerge earlier . on the mesoscopic level , we find leading sectors experiencing stronger and longer volatility shocks , while trailing sectors experience weaker and shorter volatility shocks . in our shock - by - shock causal - link analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we also find shorter delays between corresponding shocks in more closely related economic sectors . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our analysis reveals evidences for complex sectorial structures , as well as nonlinear amplification in the propagating volatility shocks . from a perspective relevant to public policy </S>",
    "<S> , our study suggests an endogeneous sectorial dynamics during the mid-2003 economic recovery , in contrast to strong exogeneous driving by federal reserve interest rate cuts during the mid-2007 onset . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , we find for the sequence of closely spaced interest rate cuts instituted in 2007/2008 , the first few cuts effectively lowered market volatilities , while the next few cuts counter - effectively increased market volatilities . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent cuts evoked little response from the market .    us </S>",
