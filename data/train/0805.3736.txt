    "graphene , a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms , has attracted intense attention in the past few years.@xcite its properties bear some similarities with , and some striking differences from , conventional 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) systems found in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "it is well - known that the latter has a rich phase diagram in the quantum hall regime .",
    "when @xmath5 , the average inter - electron distance measured in units of bohr radius , is not very big , there are integer and fractional quantum hall liquid states , as well as charge density waves ( cdws ) of various forms , including wigner crystals of quasi - electrons , bubbles and stripes at fillings around these liquid states , and analogous particle - hole conjugates of these states @xcite . in high magnetic fields , the particular state is essentially determined by the filling factor @xmath3 , defined as the ratio of the electron density to the density of magnetic flux quanta penetrating the plane . when @xmath5 is increased , these quantum hall phases undergo transitions to wigner crystal ( wc ) states with a single electron per unit cell .",
    "( for very small @xmath3 , there may also be wigner crystals of composite fermions @xcite . )",
    "if the phase diagram is plotted in the @xmath6 ( density ) - @xmath2 ( magnetic field ) plane , away from the origin , there is a fan of quantum hall phases , but the origin is expected to be completely surrounded by wigner crystal states @xcite [ see fig .",
    "[ fig:2deg ] ] .",
    "the integer quantized hall effect has been observed in graphene @xcite , and , except for a well - understood shift in the precise values of the plateaus @xcite , the hall conductance appears rather similar to that found in the conventional 2deg .",
    "nevertheless , the behavior of clean and cold graphene in the low doping limit is likely to be different than that of the conventional 2deg . unlike the latter , non",
    "- interacting electrons in graphene to a good approximation obey a massless dirac equation @xcite , with two inequivalent dirac points in two different valleys ( denoted as @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) in the brillouin zone .",
    "when the system is undoped the fermi energy passes directly through these dirac points . with interactions , continuum @xcite and tight - binding @xcite studies of the this system in mean - field theory indicate that the system remains in a liquid state in zero magnetic field even at arbitrarily low doping . on the other hand",
    ", hartree - fock calculations @xcite and exact diagonalization studies @xcite suggest that cdws are possible in a large magnetic field  where states are restricted to a single or two @xcite landau levels ( lls )  and that the phase diagram is similar to that of the conventional 2deg . in this paper",
    "we address the question of how the system passes from these strong - field states into the liquid state as the field and density are lowered to small values .    for the conventional 2deg , the quantum hall states give way to the wc in the low - field , low density limit due to landau level mixing ( llm ) .",
    "this allows the electrons to form wavepackets that are more localized than is possible within a single landau level , thereby lowering the interaction energy @xcite .",
    "the degree of llm is determined by a coupling constant @xmath9 , the ratio of the typical coulomb interaction energy @xmath10 to the scale of the ll separation . for both graphene and the conventional 2deg ,",
    "@xmath10 is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the magnetic length .",
    "however , the ll separations are different in the two cases . in the conventional 2deg ,",
    "it is given by @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 and in the large @xmath2 limit where @xmath9 is small , llm is negligible . in graphene ,",
    "the lls are not equally spaced @xcite , so we instead characterize it by the gap between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 lls divided by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fermi velocity . then @xmath20 is a field - independent constant @xcite , typically estimated to be of order 1 or smaller .",
    "nevertheless , even though @xmath9 is field - independent , the degree of llm can change with @xmath2 even for fixed filling factor , and we shall see below that it in fact does , albeit by a small amount . this is because in addition to positive energy levels , the dirac equation in a magnetic field supports negative energy landau level states , as well as a zero energy ll , for each spin , provided the zeeman energy is neglected .",
    "moreover , the low energy theory of graphene involves two such dirac points ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 valleys ) , so there are two copies of these energy levels in the spectrum . when undoped , all the negative energy states are filled , as well as one of the two zero - energy states @xcite .",
    "added electrons interact with the electrons in these filled levels , which changes the _ effective _ energy of the higher lls .",
    "because the landau level structure of these filled levels varies with field , the splitting between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 energy levels does not precisely the follow the @xmath21 behavior discussed above .    in a continuum description ,",
    "the filling of the negative levels is characterized by a ( negative ) integer @xmath22 , which denotes the lowest ll which must be filled to accommodate one electron per atom , the density of mobile electrons of undoped graphene @xcite .",
    "an extra field dependence thus enters the problem through @xmath22 , and is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the area of the sample , @xmath25 is the lattice constant of the triangular ( bravais ) lattice and the factor of 4 in the denominator comes from the spin and valley degeneracies .",
    "the interaction of electrons with those in the negative levels is most easily described in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , where it appears as a contribution to the exchange self - energy . for uniform liquid states ,",
    "we find that the coulomb energy decreases faster with decreasing b than the difference in effective energy between the highest occupied level and the lowest unoccupied level , so that the ratio between kinetic and potential energy actually _ increases _ with decreasing @xmath2 , because @xmath26 increases . we will demonstrate a similar effect for stripe states , and believe it should be ubiquitous for charge - ordered and liquid quantum hall states .    because this effect is a result of filling @xmath26 negative lls",
    ", it is a concern that it may be an artifact of the cutoff procedure used in our hf calculations . to check this",
    ", we performed an analogous calculation for interacting electrons in a tight - binding model , where no artificial cutoff needs to be introduced .",
    "we obtain results from this model that are very similar to those of the continuum model .",
    "the consequence of this is that , for states where llm is small at large values of @xmath2 , we expect it remain small , and even _ decrease _ , with decreasing @xmath2 . while it is not immediately obvious that with @xmath27 one should find weak llm in these quantum hall states , this does appear to be the case for wc and bubble states @xcite , and as we demonstrate below , for stripe and uniform liquid states .",
    "the surprising result is that , within the hartree - fock approach , one expects these states to persist to arbitrarily small field .",
    "thus , many different states persist down to the origin of the phase diagram in @xmath6 - @xmath2 plane [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene ] ] .",
    "because these states follow trajectories of fixed @xmath3 in the plane , the density of electrons participating these cdw states decreases with @xmath2 , such that their amplitude scales roughly as @xmath2 , and the wavelength as @xmath28 .",
    "the stripe states , and by analogy other cdw states , disappear continuously as @xmath4 , eventually becoming indistinguishable from a uniform liquid state in the low field limit .",
    "nevertheless , in principle , for a clean , undeformed graphene system , this implies that in principle many states emanate from the @xmath29 point in the phase diagram .",
    "we note that this behavior is very specific to the @xmath30 form for coulomb interactions that is natural in this system . for shorter range interactions , where a length scale other than the magnetic length is involved in the interaction range , the effective value of @xmath9 will increase with decreasing field as in the standard 2deg , at low densities and fields llm should destabilize the high field states , and a wc state",
    "should result .",
    "such a situation could arise if a metallic gate is sufficiently close to the graphene plane to effectively screen the long - range component of the coulomb interaction .",
    "more generally , the behavior discussed here may be understood as being a consequence of the marginal nature of the @xmath30 coulomb interaction in undoped graphene . as has been shown by us",
    "elsewhere @xcite , the energy difference between landau levels near the fermi energy is increased by the filled fermi sea , by an amount proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "this logarithmic increase of the ll spacing with increasing @xmath26 can be reinterpreted as the fermi velocity being renormalized upwards as the high - energy cutoff of the theory is increased @xcite . that the ll spacing",
    "_ increases _ slightly with increasing @xmath26 as the doping is decreased is consistent with interactions being marginally irrelevant in this system @xcite .",
    "had it decreased instead , the interactions would be marginally relevant , one would expect to find a wc state near the origin of the @xmath32 phase diagram .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : continuum ] , we describe the continuum limit hamiltonian , and the hartree - fock approximation used to study quantum hall states in the presence of llm . in section  [ sec : result ] , we discuss the results of these continuum calculations . in section",
    "[ sec : hubbard ] , we introduce a tight - binding model with hubbard interactions , and demonstrate that the suppression of llm found in the continuum calculations is not an artifact of our cutoff procedure .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "in standard 2deg s , it is known that the hartree - fock approximation is quite reliable for electronic states in high landau levels @xcite .",
    "the situation should be similar for graphene , particularly if one can show that llm is small for states in high lls , as we will indeed find self - consistently below .",
    "we thus adopt the hartree - fock approximation for the states we study .",
    "more specifically , our hartree - fock approach to the dirac equation description of uniform and stripe quantum hall phases in graphene is adapted from a procedure developed for electrons in a standard 2deg @xcite ; in what follows we briefly outline the method , and highlight the ( largely technical ) differences .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system in a magnetic field is @xmath33 where the numbers denote composite indices for the different quantum numbers specifying the states [ e.g. , @xmath34 ( ll index , guiding center coordinate , spin , pseudospin ( valley ) index ) ] , @xmath35 is the ll spectrum plus the zeeman energy , and @xmath36 are matrix elements for the coulomb interaction .",
