    "it is well known that the leading term in the expansion of the london dispersion attractive interaction energy between a pair of atoms or molecules at long distance @xmath1 takes the form @xmath2",
    "the @xmath0 dispersion coefficients are conveniently expressed by the casimir - polder formula  @xcite involving imaginary - frequency dynamic dipole polarizabilities , and can be efficiently calculated from linear - response time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft )  @xcite . in such tddft calculations of @xmath0 coefficients ,",
    "a number of approximations have been used for the kohn - sham exchange - correlation potential @xmath3 and the corresponding response kernel @xmath4 , including the local - density approximation ( lda )  @xcite , generalized - gradient approximations ( gga )  @xcite , hybrid approximations  @xcite and optimized effective potential ( oep ) approaches  @xcite . using the generalized casimir - polder formula  @xcite , non - expanded dispersion energies",
    "can also be calculated from tddft  @xcite .",
    "the best results are obtained with lda or gga density functionals with asymptotically corrected potentials , hybrid approximations , and oep approaches , with a typical accuracy on the @xmath0 coefficients of atoms and small molecules of the order of 5% .    in the last decade ,",
    "hybrid tddft approaches based on a range separation of electron - electron interactions have been increasingly used .",
    "the range - separated tddft approach that was first developed is based on the long - range correction ( lc ) scheme  @xcite , which combines long - range hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange with a short - range exchange density functional and a standard full - range correlation density functional .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the lc scheme corrects the underestimation of rydberg excitation energies of small molecules  @xcite and the overestimation of ( hyper)polarizabilities of long conjugated molecules  @xcite usually obtained with standard ( semi)local density - functional approximations .",
    "a variety of other similar range - separated tddft schemes have also been employed , which for example use an empirically modified correlation density functional depending on the range - separation parameter  @xcite , or introduce a fraction of hf exchange at shorter range as well  @xcite , such as in the cam - b3lyp approximation  @xcite .",
    "recently , some of us have studied a new variant of range - separated tddft  @xcite based on the range - separated hybrid ( rsh ) scheme  @xcite , which differs from the lc scheme in that it uses a short - range correlation density functional instead of a full - range one .",
    "this range - separated tddft approach , referred to as tdrsh , is motivated by the fact that , as for exchange , the long - range part of standard correlation density - functional approximations such as the lda is usually inaccurate  @xcite , so one may as well remove it .",
    "the tdrsh method can then be viewed as a first - level approximation before adding more accurate long - range correlation , e.g. , by linear - response density - matrix functional theory ( dmft )  @xcite or linear - response multiconfiguration self - consistent field ( mcscf ) theory  @xcite . applied with a short - range adiabatic lda exchange - correlation kernel , it was found that this tdrsh method gives in fact electronic excitation energies and oscillator strengths of small molecules very similar to the ones obtained by the range - separated tddft method based on the lc scheme , suggesting that the tdrsh method is already a reasonably accurate method even before adding explicit long - range correlations  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we further assess the tdrsh method by calculating isotropic @xmath0 dispersion coefficients of a set of closed - shell atoms and molecules .",
    "in particular , we investigate the impact of long - range hf exchange on these @xmath0 coefficients .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only range - separated tddft method that had been applied so far to the calculation of van der waals dispersion coefficients was the one based on cam - b3lyp  @xcite , but the different results were inconclusive on whether or not long - range hf exchange brings any improvement .",
    "hartree atomic units ( a.u . ) are used throughout the paper .",
    "the isotropic @xmath0 dispersion coefficient between two subsystems @xmath5 and @xmath6 is given by the casimir - polder formula  @xcite ( see appendix  [ app : casimirpolder ] ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average imaginary - frequency dynamic dipole polarizability of subsytem @xmath9 , which has the general expression @xmath10 where the sum is over all excited states @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dipole oscillator strength and the excitation energy for the transition to the excited state @xmath11 .",

    "the range - separation parameter @xmath42 acts as the inverse of a smooth `` cut - off radius '' delimiting the long - range and short - range parts of the electron - electron interaction . for @xmath43 , the method reduces to standard tddft ( with a pure density functional and in the adiabatic approximation ) . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the method reduces to standard time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) .    to investigate the effect of range separation due to modification of the ground - state exchange - correlation potential @xmath3 alone , without involving the exchange - correlation kernel @xmath4 , we also compute @xmath0 coefficients using bare ( uncoupled ) polarizabilities @xmath45 where the bare excitation energies are simply given by orbital energy differences , @xmath46 , and the bare dipole length oscillator strengths by @xmath47    the exact ( non - relativistic ) oscillator strengths obey the well - known thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule ( or @xmath48-sum rule )  @xcite @xmath49 where the sum is over all transitions and",
    "@xmath50 is the number of electrons .",
    "physically , the trk sum rule is related to the equivalence of the dipole length and dipole velocity forms of oscillator strengths , which stems from electromagnetic gauge invariance ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the trk sum rule determines the asymptotic behavior of the dynamic polarizability at large imaginary frequency , @xmath51 , @xmath52 it has been shown that , in the limit of a complete one - electron basis set , the trk sum rule is satisfied in tdhf  @xcite and in tddft with pure density functionals ( without nonlocal hf exchange )  @xcite or with the oep exact - exchange approach  @xcite . in the appendix  [ app : trk ] , we show that the trk sum rule is also satisfied in tdrsh , and in fact with any usual hybrid approximation , as long as the same amount of non - local hf exchange is consistently used in the ground - state potential generating the orbitals and in the response kernel .",
    "by contrast , the bare oscillator strengths in the dipole length form satisfy the trk sum rule only if the orbitals have been generated with a local potential  @xcite .",
    "as the hf and rsh orbitals are generated with a non - local hf exchange potential , the bare hf and rsh dipole length oscillator strengths do not sum to the number of electrons .",

    "we use the value of @xmath57 bohr@xmath58 , which was previously used in ground - state range - separated hybrid methods for applications to weak intermolecular interactions  @xcite , without trying to re - optimize it .    for the rare - gas and alkaline - earth - metal atoms , we use large",

    "for all atoms ( except , of course , he ) , we include all excitations from the core orbitals in the response calculation . with this setup ,",

    "for example for kr , excluding the core excitations and using the contracted d - aug - cc - pvtz basis set gives a tdrshlda @xmath0 coefficient that is smaller by only about 1.5% than the one obtained with inclusion of core excitations and with the uncontracted d - aug - cc - pcv5z basis set .",
