    "one of the major goals of spintronic applications has always been to manipulate electron s spin degree of freedom to create a new paradigm  @xcite in the fields of quantum information processing .",
    "spin-@xmath3 particles are a natural choice for a qubit in quantum computers .",
    "so , generation of spin polarized beam is a highly significant issue as far as spintronic applications are concerned . a more or less usual way of realization  @xcite of spin filtering action is by using ferromagnetic leads or by external magnetic field .",
    "but , in the first case , spin injection from ferromagnetic lead is difficult due to large resistivity mismatch and for the second one , the difficulty is to confine a very strong magnetic field into a small region like a quantum ring .",
    "therefore , attention is being paid for modeling of spin filter using the intrinsic properties of mesoscopic systems such as spin - orbit ( so ) interaction  @xcite .",
    "originating from the relativistic correction to the schrdinger equation , so interaction provides an all electrical way to generate and manipulate spin current in a far precise way rather than the usual magnetic field based spin control .",
    "the main source of so coupling in mesoscopic systems comes either from magnetic impurities ( extrinsic type ) , or from bulk asymmetry or structural inversion asymmetry in the confining potential of the system ( intrinsic type ) yielding dresselhaus or rashba type of so interaction  @xcite .",
    "studies on rashba or dresselhaus kind of interactions has made a significant impact in semiconductor spintronics as far as the control of spin dynamics is concerned .",
    "since so interaction couples the spin degree of freedom with the momentum of an electron , so it is possible to achieve spin polarized currents in output terminals of a multi - terminal mesoscopic ring when an unpolarized electron beam is injected into its input terminal , though kramer s degeneracy suggests that due to preservation of time reversal symmetry only so interaction can never induce in a two - terminal system  @xcite , whereas , in case of multi - terminal system the condition gets relaxed . additionally , in a multi - terminal system the degree of spin coherence can also be manipulated even when a polarized beam is injected .    till date",
    "a lot of theoretical work has been done to model spin selective transmission . in 2003 ,",
    "kislev and kim have proposed that a planar t - shaped    structure with a ring resonator can be highly efficient in producing spin polarized currents in different output arms in presence of rashba so interaction  @xcite . following that in 2005 , shelykh _ et al . _",
    "investigated analytically by s - matrix theory both the effects of magnetic flux and rashba coupling on charge and spin transport in a multi - terminal quantum ring  @xcite .",
    "then , in 2006 , peeters _",

    "_ has designed a spin filter and spin splitter considering a two - terminal device in presence of external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "thus , the studies involving spin dependent transport in multi - terminal mesoscopic rings have already generated a wealth of literature , but to the best of our knowledge there is still a need to look deeper into the problem to address several important issues those have not been well analyzed earlier , for example , the understanding of the effect of rashba and dresselhaus so couplings on all three components @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the polarization vector associated with the charge current through the outgoing leads , and also the sensitivity of the polarization components on different electrode - ring interface configurations .    in the present work we mainly concentrate on these issues .",
    "here we analyze the dependence of the polarization components @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the two output terminals of a three - terminal mesoscopic ring subjected to rashba and dresselhaus so interactions . within a tight - binding ( tb ) framework we evaluate these quantities ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) using a general spin density matrix formalism , which was first approached by nikolic and co - workers  @xcite in 2004 .",
    "they presented an elegant way of expressing all three components @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of outgoing spin polarization vector in terms of spin resolved transmission matrices within the framework of landauer - bttiker formalism .",
    "this formalism encompasses both pure and mixed states as incoming beam and provides knowledge to investigate how polarization evolves  @xcite in outgoing current due to rashba or dresselhaus interaction , scattering at lead - conductor interface and spin dependent scattering off impurities in both the weak and strong disordered regimes .",
    "the sensitivity of the polarization components on the electrode - ring interface geometry is also described in detail to make the present communication a self contained study .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "these features can be explained from the following arguments .",
    "the @xmath58 component of spin polarization essentially describes the normalized difference between the charge currents of up and down spin electrons    flowing through the output leads ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn24 ] ) , since in our present scheme we choose the quantization direction along the @xmath57ve @xmath58 axis .",
    "now , it is well known that the up and down spin electrons scatter in opposite directions when they traverse through a conductor subjected to a so interaction which is the aspect of visualizing mesoscopic spin hall effect and accumulation of opposite spins on the opposite edges .",
    "therefore , spin polarization with opposite signs for the component @xmath2 is expected in two output leads those are attached symmetrically to the mesoscopic ring with respect to the input lead .",
    "the above argument can not be given to explain the characteristic features of the other two components @xmath0 and @xmath1 since we select @xmath57ve @xmath58 axis as the quantization direction . in our theoretical framework",
    "we have already stated that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are evaluated from the expectation values of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",

    "but , for @xmath1 the situation is somewhat different as @xmath141 is coupled with the @xmath139-component of the momentum which shows identical sign at the equivalent points ( see fig.[diagram ] ) .",
    "hence , a destructive interference takes place and it leads to a vanishingly small spin polarization at the output leads . based on the symmetry arguments of the s - matrix elements kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown analytically that in a y - shaped conductor subjected to so interaction the transmission amplitudes for the @xmath139 and @xmath58 components get equal magnitude and opposite phases for symmetrically connected leads which provide opposite spin polarization for these two components . while , for the @xmath142 component almost zero polarization is achieved with identical phase in the leads .",
    "our numerical results for a three - terminal mesoscopic ring match very well with their analytical findings .",

    "below we justify these phenomena through simple analytical arguments .    the tb hamiltonians ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) describing the rashba and dresselhaus so interaction terms can be transformed into each other by a simple unitary transformation using the matrix @xmath147 , i.e. , @xmath148 = @xmath146 , where @xmath149 = @xmath150 . therefore ,",

    "it is already said that @xmath2 in presence of rashba coupling is just equal in magnitude but opposite in sign with @xmath2 in presence of dresselhaus coupling , so when both the interactions are present in equal strength net polarization must vanish .",

    "one can control rashba so interaction by a suitable gate voltage , and hence , it can be measured . on the other hand , the possible techniques for the determination of dresselhaus",
    "so coupling are relatively few .",
    "recently , we have put forward some ideas of estimating so coupling strengths in a single sample which include the measurement of the minimum in drude weight  @xcite which describes the conducting nature of the material , the observation of transmission resonance or anti - resonance of outgoing electrons  @xcite and the determination of persistent spin current  @xcite in an isolated loop geometry in presence of these two so interactions . in the present work",
    "we give a separate proposal for it . for a single sample",
    "if a finite polarization is achieved for a particular value of @xmath28 , then one can tune rashba so coupling by means of gate voltage to get vanishing spin polarization at the output currents .",
    "thus , knowing the rashba so coupling , an accurate measurement of dresselhaus term is possible .",
    "the spin polarization turns out to be sensitive to the lead - ring    interface geometry . to this end",
    ", we analyze the behavior of spin polarization components in a three - terminal mesoscopic ring where the output leads are coupled asymmetrically ( see fig .  [ multiring ] ) with respect to the source lead .    in fig .",
    "[ polasymeng1 ] we display the variation of spin polarization components @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for a @xmath131-site ring described with rashba so interaction only , i.e. , setting @xmath28 at zero .",
    "the red curves represent the results for the lead @xmath137 , while for the lead @xmath138 they are shown by the green lines . from the spectra",
    "we see that , unlike the symmetric configuration , the magnitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath2 in two output    leads are no longer identical even when one so coupling is set equal to zero .",
    "this is solely due to the effect of quantum interference among the electronic waves passing through different arms of the mesoscopic ring .",
    "all the other properties , for examples , the phase reversals of the polarization components @xmath0 and @xmath2 in two output leads and the vanishingly small amplitude of @xmath1 remain exactly same as discussed earlier in the case of symmetric configuration .",
    "the same quantities are also analyzed for this asymmetric configuration considering the ring with only dresselhaus so interaction , i.e. , setting @xmath135 .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "[ polasymeng2 ] . except getting different amplitudes of polarizing currents in two output leads ,",
    "all the other physical phenomena remain unchanged as discussed in fig .",
    "[ poleng2 ] .",
    "before we end this section , in figs .",
    "[ polx]-[polz ] we describe the variations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of rashba so coupling considering two different values of @xmath28 for this asymmetric lead - ring interface geometry to make the present communication a self contained study .",
    "the amplitudes of the individual components of spin polarization in two output terminals get changed , as expected , and their magnitudes can also be tuned by including other so coupling .",
    "the physical picture about the possibilities of determining so fields by observing the vanishing spin polarization of out going currents in the limit @xmath158 remains also invariant for this lead - ring interface geometry , like the symmetric configuration .",
    "to conclude , in the present work we have described spin dependent transport through a multi - terminal mesoscopic ring in presence of rashba and dresselhaus so interactions . within a tb framework we have determined the polarization components @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of outgoing currents using a general spin density matrix formalism . the sensitivity of these components on the lead - ring interface geometry has also been analyzed in detail to make the communication is self contained study . from our extensive numerical work",
    "we have established that a two - terminal mesoscopic ring with only so coupling , in absence of any magnetic impurity or external magnetic field , can not induce spin polarization in the output lead . on the other hand ,",
    "a multi - terminal geometry , subjected to so interaction , containing at least two out put leads can generate polarized spin currents from a completely unpolarized electron beam even in absence of any magnetic field or magnetic like impurities .",
    "finally , we have also provided a possible realization of determining dresselhaus so coupling knowing the rashba term in a single sample by observing the vanishing spin polarization of the outgoing currents , and hence facilitates a possible experimental measurement in this line .",
    "finally we point out that , the presented results in this communication are also valid even for non - zero temperatures ( @xmath162k ) as the broadening of the energy levels caused by side - attached leads is much higher than the thermal broadening  @xcite ."
