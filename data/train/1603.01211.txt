    "there is a well - known problem ( problem 5.43 ) in  @xcite that asks the reader to show that if a charged particle starts at the center of a circular ( of radius @xmath0 ) , radially - symmetric , flux - free magnetic field region , it will exit the region ( if it exits ) perpendicular to the circular boundary . this is an exercise in angular momentum conservation , and its ultimate utility resides in running the problem backwards : if you shoot a particle into a region with this special magnetic field , it will hit the center provided it enters perpendicular to the circular boundary of the region .",
    "our interest in the problem begins with the determination of the critical velocity that allows the particle to escape the field region at all .",
    "since there is no traditional potential energy barrier to go over , it is not immediately obvious what sets the minimum  escape \" speed here . after we determine the condition for escape , highlighting the role of a gauge - fixed magnetic vector potential in classical mechanics , we turn to particle trajectories in quantum mechanics .    from schrdinger s equation in a region with magnetic vector potential @xmath1",
    ", we can establish that the expectation value of position satisfies the following ode ( see  @xcite problem 4.59 , for example  @xcite ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the canonical momentum .",
    "if the magnetic field was constant , this would reduce to @xmath4 and the expectation value @xmath5 would be directly comparable to the classical velocity . for magnetic fields that are _",
    "not _ constant , the right - hand side of  ( [ expp ] ) defines an exotic effective force , one which is very different from @xmath6 ( as we shall see ) . as an equation of motion",
    ", we do nt know what to expect for @xmath7 from  ( [ expp ] ) .",
    "indeed , we shall see that the expectation value of position is quite different from the classical position vector for these magnetic trajectories , and there are other differences as well . if the equation of motion for the expectation value of position was  ( [ wrongexpp ] ) , we would expect the  speed \" ( the magnitude of @xmath5 here ) to be constant , just as it is classically .",
    "but the effective force on the right of  ( [ expp ] ) does not lead to a constant magnitude for the expectation value of velocity .",
    "there are also similarities between the classical trajectories and the position expectation value of quantum mechanical solutions  we will use a numerical solution of schrdinger s equation to show that the expectation value of kinetic energy is constant ( as it should be for motion in a magnetic field ) , and we can also establish that certain geometric properties of the quantum mechanical trajectory are shared with the classical trajectory : the particle exits the field region perpendicular to the boundary , and we can get both  bound \" motion , and  escape \" trajectories . the difference between the trajectory - based  speed \" , @xmath8 and the kinetic energy  speed \" , @xmath9 is the main distinction between the classical and quantum mechanical trajectories , but it is a significant difference .",
    "the lagrangian for a particle moving in the presence of a magnetic field is : @xmath10 where @xmath1 is the magnetic vector potential .",
    "the canonical momentum is then @xmath11 .",
    "the legendre transform of the lagrangian defines the hamiltonian : @xmath12 we know that the hamiltonian is conserved , and that the speed of the particle is also a constant of the motion ( typical of motion in magnetic fields , which do no work ) .    for our target problem , the magnetic field points in the @xmath13 direction , and we re interested in motion occurring in the @xmath14 plane ( we will set the initial velocity to lie in this plane ) . the magnetic vector potential takes the general form : @xmath15 ( its magnitude depends only on @xmath16 , similar to the magnetic field itself ) . in polar coordinates ,",

    "since we are starting at the origin , we ll pick the constant @xmath24 ( to avoid the @xmath25 and @xmath26 that would appear in @xmath27 otherwise ) .    under these simplifying ( but reasonable ) assumptions ,",

    "what do we make of the fact that if we take @xmath22 less than this escape speed , there will be imaginary values for @xmath34 ?",
    "the particle never gets to those regions  when @xmath36 , the particle turns around , so that all of the motion will occur within a circle of radius @xmath39 defined by the value of @xmath40 at which @xmath41 .",
    "the escape speed in  ( [ escape ] ) uses the maximum value of @xmath40 in order to overcome all such constraining circles .",

    "so far , we have required that @xmath15 , appropriate for a radially symmetric magnetic field pointing in the @xmath42 direction , in coulomb gauge .",
    "we also took @xmath21 in order to set the initial particle angular momentum to zero .    for flux - free fields ( over the domain of the disk of radius @xmath0 )",
    ", there is an additional requirement : @xmath43 and for our form for @xmath1 , this reads @xmath44 which means that @xmath45 .",
    "what could we add to @xmath1 that preserves these basic requirements ?",
    "the gradient of a function @xmath46 could be added to @xmath1 , @xmath47 , yielding the same magnetic field .",
    "but , if we are to remain in coulomb gauge , @xmath46 must be a harmonic function , @xmath48 .",
    "the flux - free boundary condition imposes the additional requirement that @xmath46 is independent of @xmath49 ( else we ca nt get @xmath50 at @xmath0 for all @xmath49 ) , so we are left with @xmath51 for constant @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which will not allow us to set the boundary condition at @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) unless @xmath56 .",
    "so in this case , the gauge is fully fixed , and that s what allows us to unambiguously identify an escape speed .",
    "we can also use this @xmath45 requirement to solve the original problem posed in  @xcite  from  ( [ dots ] ) , we have , at @xmath0 : @xmath57 , so that all of the velocity is in the @xmath58 direction , with none of it in the @xmath32 direction , the particle exits the region radially .",

    "the maximum of the potential occurs at @xmath66 where the magnitude is @xmath67 . for initial speeds less than this , we will get bound trajectories , and for initial speeds greater than this , the particle will exit the field region perpendicular to the boundary .",
    "examples are shown in  figure  [ fig : exe ] , in which we plot two bound trajectories together with their bounding circles ( of radius @xmath39 obtained by solving @xmath41 for @xmath39 ) , and the trajectory for a particle that escapes .",

    "this is fundamentally different behavior than the classical case and comes from the fact that the notion of  speed \" in quantum mechanics has two different interpretations  there is the magnitude of the expectation value of velocity , @xmath8 which is not constant , and alternatively @xmath9 which is constant . in classical mechanics , there is no distinction to be made .     is shown above , with the speed below.,width=288 ]    we can once again compare the  forces \" defined by  ( [ expp ] ) and  ( [ wrongexpp ] ) in the trapped case  those are shown in  figure  [ fig : trapforce ] , and again we see that the left and right - hand sides of  ( [ expp ] ) are better matched than the left - hand side of  ( [ expp ] ) and the fictitious @xmath6 ( the right - hand side of  ( [ wrongexpp ] ) ) .",

    "we have attempted to minimize this contribution to our problem by placing the boundaries far away , and keeping the initial gaussian localized within the field region  but the boundaries do put a bound on how long we expect to be able to compare the classical and quantum trajectories .",
    "the motion of particles in the presence of magnetic fields is complicated ",
    "few closed - form solutions exist , and while we can say quite a bit about the behavior of particles moving in magnetic fields , the trajectories themselves require numerical solution , even classically .",
    "the situation is worse quantum mechanically  even constant magnetic fields prove difficult to handle  solving schrdinger s equation for such fields , starting from a reasonable initial wave function ( like gaussian ) is not possible analytically . in this paper",

    "we generated some trajectories for both  trapped \" and  escape \" behavior numerically to verify that the escape speed matches its theoretical prediction .",
    "that prediction relied on a completely gauge - fixed magnetic vector potential in coulomb gauge  it would be interesting to explore the effect of other gauge choices .    on the quantum mechanical side",
    ", we extended crank - nicolson to handle magnetic fields while retaining the norm - preservation of the method . using a linear , flux - free magnetic field",
    ", we verified that the behavior of the position expectation value matches the classical trajectories in the following ways : 1 .",
    "particles exit perpendicular to the boundary of the field region , and 2",
    ".   trajectories can remain inside the field region or escape , depending on the relation of the initial momentum to the field strength  @xcite .",
    "we also verified that the expectation value of energy remains constant , agreeing with the classical result , and yet classically , energy conservation _ means _ that the speed of the particle is constant ( since the only energy is kinetic )  for the quantum mechanical particle ,",
    "however , the speed @xmath154 is not constant , even though the energy is ( so that @xmath9 is constant ) .    in the case of a uniform magnetic field",
    ", our classical intuition can be used to predict the behavior of quantum mechanical expectation values , basically because the dynamical variable @xmath5 appears in  ( [ wrongexpp ] ) just as @xmath155 appears in the lorentz force law ( and indeed , we recover circular motion with predictable radius and constant speed using our initial gaussian and a constant magnetic field for @xmath156 solved using our numerical crank - nicolson method ) . for the more complicated flux - free magnetic field considered here , our classical intuition does not help us , because the effective force on the right - hand side of  ( [ expp ] ) involves @xmath157 and @xmath62 inside the expectation value  roughly speaking , we are looking at an effective force of the form @xmath158 rather than @xmath6 , _ different _ effective forces , leading to demonstrably different dynamics . in the context of ehrenfest s theorem ( see , for example  @xcite",
