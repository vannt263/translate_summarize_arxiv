    "the subject of black hole thermodynamics had its origin in the observation@xcite of a mathematical connection between various quantities that are relevant to black hole dynamics - horizon - area , mass , surface gravity etc . and",

    "consequences of this mathematical connection drive the current intense activity in this field , more than four decades after its initial discovery .",
    "we now suspect that this connection actually goes much deeper than a simple one - to - one correspondence between various parameters .",
    "it is known that many aspects of quantum field theories of various systems have their dual in gravitational systems .",
    "this connection enables us to analyze the behaviour of such systems by studying their dual gravitational theories , which is often a much easier task .",

    "[ [ section ] ]    the occurrence of phase transitions between various black hole states is a very important aspect of thermodynamic studies of gravitational systems , since it would enable us to study the behaviour of their dual systems near their critical points .",
    "these phase transitions can be studied in various ways - studying the heat capacity of black hole spacetimes is one approach@xcite , in which the positivity of the specific heat would point to a stable phase of the black hole while a negative value signals an unstable phase .",
    "transitions between thermal ads space and black hole configurations , discovered by hawking@xcite , is considered as the pioneering study on the subject . according to it ,",
    "pure thermal radiation in ads space becomes unstable above a certain temperature and collapses to form black holes .",
    "this is the well - known hawking - page phase transition which describes the phase transition between the schwarzschild ads black hole and the thermal ads space .",
    "this is dual@xcite to the confinement / deconfinement phase transition of gauge fields according to the ads / cft correspondence@xcite .",
    "since then , phase transitions of black holes have been investigated from different perspectives .",
    "some recent works may be found in @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    another approach to analyze black hole thermodynamic stability is to apply the methods of differential geometry by considering the thermodynamic phase space of a black hole system as a riemannian manifold and studying its curvature , which would then represent thermodynamic interaction@xcite .",
    "this curvature is determined by assigning a metric to the thermodynamic phase space .",
    "the components of the metric are defined in terms of second derivatives of suitable thermodynamic potentials with respect to a set of extensive variables @xmath2 of the thermodynamic system .",
    "usual choices for the thermodynamic potentials are the mass @xmath3 , internal energy @xmath4 , entropy @xmath5 , etc . of the black hole spacetime .",
    "depending on the choice of the metric , different versions of the geometric approach exist .",
    "the thermodynamic geometry method was first introduced by weinhold@xcite and ruppeiner @xcite .",
    "weinhold proposed a metric structure in the energy representation as @xmath6 , while ruppeiner defined the metric structure as @xmath7 .",
    "components of these metrics are those of the hessian matrix of the internal energy @xmath3 and the entropy @xmath5 respectively , with respect to the extensive thermodynamic variables @xmath2 .",
    "weinhold s metric was found to be conformally connected to ruppeiner s through the relation @xmath8@xcite , @xmath9 being the horizon temperature .",
    "ruppeiner s metric has extensively been used in the geometric analysis of various black hole spacetimes@xcite .",
    "recently , quevedo et al.@xcite presented a new formalism called geometrothermodynamics , which allows us to derive legendre invariant metrics for the phase space .",
    "geometrothermodynamics presents a unified geometry where the metric structure describes various types of black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    theoretical interest in the black hole horizon area stems from arguments@xcite that the origin of horizon entropy is related to the quantum structure of spacetime .",
    "statistical mechanics tells us that entropy is a measure of the number of occupied microstates of a system that have equal probability of being occupied .",
    "the direct counting of these microstates in the case of black hole spacetimes is still an unresolved problem . on one hand",
    ", entropy must obey the second law of thermodynamics , according to which it can do nothing but increase . on the other hand , we also know from the no - hair - theorem that the state of the black hole systems must be specified by a mere handful of parameters , namely the mass @xmath3 , the charge @xmath10 and the angular momentum @xmath11 of the black hole .",
    "in other words , a large portion of information regarding the fields that collapse to form black holes get lost to the observable universe , so that the nature of the microstates becomes obscure .",
    "this leads to a violation of unitarity since , according to quantum mechanics , pure states can only evolve into pure states , whereas the state inside the black hole becomes mixed after its formation .",
    "there have been suggestions@xcite that gravitational collapse could lead to the formation of topologically disconnected regions where the information could be stored .",
    "thus , black hole horizon area is considered to be intimately related to the very process of black hole formation and could offer vital glimpses into the quantum nature of spacetime itself , and thus be of incredible help in the formulation of a quantum theory of gravity . following the initial proposal of bekenstein@xcite of the discrete nature of the black hole spectrum , various approaches have been developed for the computation of the same@xcite .    [ [ section-3 ] ]    in the present work , we test the thermodynamic stability of black holes in charged , asymptotically ads , spherically symmetric spacetimes in lovelock model .",
    "ordinary thermodynamic analysis reveals the existence of two points in charged spacetimes , where the specific heat as a function of the horizon radius diverges , compared to just one in the uncharged case",
    ". then we compute the scalar curvature of the thermodynamic phase space for the spacetime using a legendre - invariant metric proposed by quevedo@xcite and find that there exist divergences in the scalar curvature near the points of divergence of the specific heat , thus explaining the thermodynamic phase transitions .",
    "we then calculate the area spectrum of black hole horizons in the model by directly calculating the adiabatic invariant for the spacetime and applying the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition to it .",

    ". we will see that the thermodynamic stability depends on both the size of the black hole and the temperature of the background ads spacetime .",
    "the thermodynamic behaviour of the black holes depends crucially on whether the temperature ( @xmath63 ) of the background spacetime ( also called thermal bath ) is * ( i ) * larger than the local maximum value ( @xmath64 ) of @xmath42 , * ( ii ) * between @xmath64 and the local minimum value ( @xmath65 ) of @xmath42 , or * ( iii ) * lower than @xmath65 .",
    "another important factor that determines the thermodynamic behaviour in all these three cases is the size @xmath25 of the black hole itself - whether it is greater than @xmath58 , in between @xmath58 and @xmath57 or less than @xmath57 .",
    "we analyze some of the possible scenarios here :",
    "in this case , we see that , similar to the case of schwarzschild - ads black holes , very large black holes in the model can always attain equilibrium with an external thermal bath at a finite temperature , since the specific heat is positive in this region .",
    "there is one difference though - when @xmath25 is large and the temperature @xmath63 of the bath is higher than the maximum value of @xmath42 , a straight line parallel to the horizontal axis meets the @xmath67 curve at only one point , which means that there exists only one final , stable , equilibrium configuration for such a black hole at that background temperature , with a horizon radius which is larger than @xmath58 .",
    "this is not the case for uncharged black holes - the uncharged spacetime always has two equilibrium configurations - one being unstable and the other being stable - as long as the temperature of the bath is higher than the minimum of @xmath42@xcite .",

    "again , there exists only one thermodynamically stable equilibrium configuration that the small black holes can get drawn towards , since the straight line parallel to the horizontal axis still cuts the @xmath67 curve at only one point . in this case , the horizon radius for the equilibrium state will be smaller than @xmath57 .",
    "the specific heat is positive in the region @xmath70 , so that a black hole with @xmath70 tends to make a transition towards this equilibrium state rather than away from it .",
    "it is clear from fig . [",

    "thus , if the temperature of the thermal bath falls in the range @xmath71 , the resultant thermodynamic behaviour of the black hole will depend on its initial size .",
    "essentially , initial black hole states with @xmath79 will evolve towards an equilibrium configuration with @xmath80 and those with @xmath81 will tend to evolve towards a configuration with @xmath82 .",

[ [ section-12 ] ]    using the usual methods of black hole thermodynamics , we calculated different thermodynamic parameters of the system such as the horizon temperature , entropy and the specific heat .",
    "we found that the horizon temperature @xmath9 , when written as a function of the horizon radius @xmath25 , has a couple of turning points , compared to just one in the uncharged case .",
    "entropy @xmath5 happens to be a monotonic function of @xmath25 , while the specific heat @xmath54 exhibits divergence at two points corresponding to the turning points of @xmath42 . from the plots of @xmath42 and @xmath59 against @xmath25",
    ", we were able to deduce the thermodynamic behaviour of the black holes .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    we found that large black holes are always able to attain thermodynamic equilibrium with the background ads spacetime ( the thermal bath ) as long as the bath has a temperature greater than the local maximum value of @xmath42 . in this case",
    ", there exists only one stable equilibrium configuration for a black hole at any bath temperature @xmath63 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be arrived at in the case of small black holes placed inside a bath at a temperature @xmath63 that is less than the local minimum value of @xmath42 .",
    "there exists a stable equilibrium configuration in this case as well , in contrast with the case of uncharged black holes . in this case , as in the previous case , initial black hole states get drawn towards the respective equilibrium configurations , since the specific heat is positive in both cases .",
    "when the temperature of the bath is in between the local maximum and local minimum values of @xmath42 , each bath temperature @xmath63 corresponds to three equilibrium black hole configurations - two stable states and one unstable state .",
    "in such a case , we concluded that initial black hole configurations would be drawn towards one of the stable points , depending on their initial size .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    in order to perform the geometric analysis of the thermodynamic evolution , we followed the method of geometrothermodynamics of quevedo@xcite .",
    "we chose what is known as the entropy representation of the thermodynamic phase space and computed the scalar curvature @xmath84 derived from a legendre invariant thermodynamic metric , the components of which are calculated using the second derivatives of the entropy of the system .",
    "we chose the mass and the charge of the black hole as the extensive parameters . since the expressions for the metric components and the scalar curvature were too long to treat analytically , we resorted to the graphical method , plotting the scalar curvature as a function of the horizon radius @xmath25 . from the plot",
    ", we found that the scalar curvature diverges at points that are very close to the points of divergence of the specific heat of the black hole , indicating that the thermodynamic phase transitions of the black hole correspond to the singularities in the corresponding thermodynamic phase space .",
    "thus , the results of geometrothermodynamics were found to be in agreement with those of ordinary black hole thermodynamics .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    next , we computed the horizon area spectrum of large , charged ads black holes in the model , motivated mainly by the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we computed the adiabatic invariant @xmath135 for the black hole spacetime taking the euclidean time @xmath136 and the horizon radius @xmath108 as the dynamical variables .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics was made use of during the computation .",
    "we applied the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule to the invariant and found that the entropy is a quantized entity with a logarithmic correction term added to it . in the limit of large black holes , the entropy becomes proportional to the horizon area for higher order lovelock theories and we were able to show that the area of such black holes also can be written as a quantized number with a logarithmic correction term added to it .",
    "the spacing @xmath133 between the various quanta was found to be dependent on the order @xmath12 of the theory ( and by extension the dimension @xmath0 of the spacetime ) and the value of the ads radius @xmath19 , although this dependence become evident only in higher dimensions and higher order theories .",
