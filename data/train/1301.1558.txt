    "the present system was first introduced by olver and rosenau in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 43 ) ) , and derived in the context of water waves in @xcite , showing @xmath10 positive and @xmath4 nonnegative to be the physically relevant case .",

    "it offers some technical challenges that will be described below .",
    "the 2ch system can suitably be rewritten as    [ eq : rewchsys10 ] @xmath11    where @xmath12 is implicitly defined by @xmath13    the reason for the intense study of the ch equation is its surprisingly rich structure . in the context of the present paper ,",
    "the focus is on the wellposedness of global weak solutions of the cauchy problem .",
    "there is an intrinsic dichotomy in the solution that appears after wave breaking , namely between solutions characterized either by conservation or dissipation of the associated energy .",
    "the two classes of solutions are for obvious reasons denoted conservative and dissipative , respectively .",
    "the fundamental nature of the problem can be understood by the following pregnant example , for simplicity presented here on the full line , rather than the periodic case .",
    "the ch equation with @xmath14 has as special solutions so - called multipeakons given by @xmath15 where the @xmath16 satisfy the explicit system of ordinary differential equations @xmath17 in the special case of @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath21 , the solution consists of two `` peaks '' , denoted peakons , that approach each other . at time @xmath21",
    "the two peakons annihilate each other , an example of wave breaking , and the solution satisfies @xmath22 pointwise at that time . for positive time",
    "two possibilities exist ; one is to let the solution remain equal to zero ( the dissipative solution ) , and other one being that that two peakons reemerge ( the conservative solution ) .",
    "a more careful analysis reveals that the @xmath23 norm of @xmath24 remains finite , while @xmath25 becomes singular , at @xmath21 , and there is an accumulation of energy in the form of a dirac delta - function at the point of annihilation .",
    "the consequences for the wellposedness of the cauchy problem are severe .",
    "the continuation of the solution past wave breaking has been studied , see @xcite .",
    "the method to handle the dichotomy is by reformulating the equation in lagrangian variables , and analyze carefully the behavior in those variables .",
    "we will detail this construction later in the introduction .",
    "the 2ch system has , in spite of its brief history , been studied extensively , and it is not possible to include a complete list of references here . however , we mention @xcite , where a similar approach to the present one , has been employed . the case with @xmath26 has been discussed in @xcite ; our approach does not extend to the case of @xmath10 negative .",

    "please see @xcite .",
    "there exists other two - component generalizations of the ch equation than the one studied here ; see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the present paper . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath28 and @xmath14 .",
    "we first make a change from eulerian to lagrangian variables and introduce a new energy variable .",

    "we then establish the existence of a unique global solution for this system ( see theorem  [ th : global ] ) , and we show that the solutions form a continuous semigroup in an appropriate norm . in order to solve the cauchy problem we have to choose the initial data appropriately . to accommodate for the possible concentration of energy we augment the natural initial data @xmath39 and @xmath40 with a nonnegative radon measure @xmath41 such that the absolutely continuous part @xmath42 equals @xmath43 .",
    "the precise translation of these initial data is given in theorem [ defl ] .",
