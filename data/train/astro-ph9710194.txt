    "ten years after paczyski s proposal ( @xcite ) to use gravitational microlensing as a tool for discovering dark stars , and four years after the identification of the first candidate events in the direction of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ( alcock et al .",
    "1993 , aubourg et al .",
    "1993 ) and galactic bulge ( @xcite ) , searches for microlensing events have started to yield quantitative information that contributes to a better understanding of galactic structure ( stanek et al .",
    "probably the most intriguing result is that the measured optical depth for microlensing towards the lmc implies a total galactic halo mass in compact objects that is within a factor of two of that required to explain the rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( @xcite , see also ansari et al .",
    "the time scales associated with these events indicate surprisingly high mass lenses and the difficulty of accounting for the events with known stellar populations has stimulated interest in star formation and evolution processes .",
    "strong limits have been set on the maximum contribution of low mass objects to the halo of the milky way ( renault et al .",
    "1997 , see also alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "given the importance of these results , it is imperative to verify them by using other lines of sight , the most promising ones being the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and m31 .",
    "here , we present a first analysis of microlensing data in the direction of the smc by using 5.3 million light curves collected by eros2 during the first year of the survey .",
    "more details can be found in ( palanque - delabrouille 1997 ) .",
    "our results have been obtained with a completely redesigned setup .",
    "the eros program now uses exclusively the dedicated 1 meter marly telescope , specially refurbished and fully automated for the eros2 survey ( bauer et al .",
    "1997 ) , now in operation at the european southern observatory at la silla , chile .",
    "the telescope optics allows simultaneous imaging in `` blue '' ( @xmath4  nm , peak at @xmath5  nm ) and `` red '' ( @xmath6  nm , peak at @xmath7  nm ) wide pass - bands of a one - square - degree field .",
    "this is achieved by a beam - splitting dichroic cube with a ccd camera mounted behind each channel .",
    "each camera contains a mosaic of 8 loral 2048 x 2048 thick ccd s .",
    "the total field is 0.7  deg ( right ascension ) x 1.4  deg ( declination ) .",
    "the pixel size is 0.6 arcsec , and typical global image quality ( atmospheric seeing + instrument ) is 2 arcsec fwhm .",
    "the read - out of the entire mosaic is done in parallel , controlled by digital signal processors , and takes 50 seconds .",
    "the data are first transferred to two vme crates ( one per color ) , which manage the real - time part of the acquisition system , and then to two alpha workstations where a quality assessment is run ( monitoring ccd defects , sky background , seeing , number of stars  ) and flat - field reduction is done .",
    "the raw and reduced data are finally saved on dlt tapes .",
    "data taking with the new apparatus began in july , 1996 .",
    "microlensing targets include fields near the galactic center , in the disk of the galaxy , and in the lmc and smc .",
    "the data discussed here concern 10 fields covering the densest @xmath8 of the smc , as illustrated in figure [ cartesmc ] .",
    "[ h ]    the fields were observed from july , 1996 to february , 1997 and again starting in july , 1997 . during the 1996 - 97 season , from 60 to 120 usable images",
    "were taken of each field , giving a sampling time of one point every 2 - 4 days on average .",
    "exposure times varied from 5  min in the central fields to 15  min in the outermost fields .",
    "the dlt tapes produced in chile are shipped to the ccpn ( in2p3 computing center , cnrs ) in lyons , france , where data processing occurs . for each of the fields ,",
    "a template image is first constructed by adding together 10 exposures of good quality , each re - sampled by a factor of 0.7 .",
    "a reference star catalog is then built using the corrfind star finding algorithm ( the stellar detection is done on a correlation image , obtained as described in section 3 , page ) .",
    "for each subsequent image , after geometrical alignment to the template catalog , each star identified on the reference catalog is fitted together with neighboring stars , using a psf determined on bright isolated stars and imposing the position from the reference catalog . a relative photometric alignment",
    "is then performed , assuming most stars do not vary .",
    "photometric errors are computed for each measurement , assuming again that most stars are stable , and parameterized as a function of star brightness and image sequence number .",
    "photometric accuracy is in the @xmath9 range at magnitude @xmath10 ( depending on image quality ) , and of the order of @xmath11 for bright stars ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the number of reconstructed stars varies from @xmath13 in the densest region ( where errors are dominated by crowding ) to @xmath14 in the outer regions ( where errors are dominated by signal - to - noise ) .",
    "the photometry is described in more details in ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 5.3 million light curves are subjected to a series of selection criteria and rejection cuts ( globally called `` cuts '' ) to isolate microlensing candidates ( palanque - delabrouille 1997 ) .",
    "the first three ( 13 ) make use of the expected general characteristics of microlensing candidates : single variations on otherwise constant light curves , which coincide in time for data taken in both colors .",
    "the next two cuts ( 4 and 5 ) are designed to reject a known background of variable stars , while the last two ( 6 and 7 ) improve the signal - to - noise of the set of selected candidates .",
    "the criteria were sufficiently loose not to reject events affected by blending or by the finite size of the source , or events involving multiple lenses or sources . we define a positive ( negative ) fluctuation as a series of data points that ( i ) starts by one point deviating by at least @xmath15 from the base flux , ( ii ) stops with at least three consecutive points below @xmath16 ( above @xmath17 ) and ( iii ) contains at least 4 points above @xmath18 ( below @xmath17 ) .",
    "the significance @xmath19 of a given variation is defined as the negative of the logarithm of the product , over the data points it contains , of the probability that each point deviates from the base flux by more than the observed fluctuation ( @xmath20 is the deviation of the point taken at time @xmath21 , in @xmath22 s , @xmath23 is the number of points within the fluctuation ) : @xmath24 we order the fluctuations along a light curve by decreasing significance .",
    "the cuts of the analysis are described hereafter :    * 1 : the main fluctuation detected in the red and blue light curves should be both positive and occur simultaneously : if i is the time interval during which the data are more than @xmath15 away from the base flux , we require @xmath25 . * 2 : to reject flat light curves with only statistical fluctuations , we require that on a given light curve + @xmath26 + in both colors . * 3 : we require that @xmath27 in both colors . * 4 : to exclude short period variable stars which exhibit scattered light curves , we require that the rms of the distribution of the deviation , in @xmath22 s , of each flux measurement from the linear interpolation between its two neighboring data points be smaller than 2.5 . * 5 : we remove two under - populated regions of the color - magnitude diagram ( see figure [ cut_hr ] ) that contain a large fraction of variable stars ( @xmath28 cephei , rv tauri variables , semi - regular giant variables and mira ceti stars ) , defined by ( flux @xmath29 given for the eros2 filters  @xmath30 for red and @xmath31 for blue  normalized to an exposure time of 300 s ) : + @xmath32 and @xmath33 + @xmath34 and @xmath35 + [ h ] * 6 : we remove events with low signal - to - noise by requiring a significant improvement of a microlensing fit ( ml ) over a constant flux fit ( cst ) , i.e. that + @xmath36/[\\chi^2({\\rm ml})/{\\rm d.o.f.}]>150 $ ] + where d.o.f . is the number of degrees of freedom . *",
    "7 : we require that the maximum magnification in the microlensing fit be greater than 1.40 .",
    "the tuning of each cut and the estimate of the efficiency of the analysis is done with monte carlo simulated light curves . to ensure similar photometric dispersion on simulated events and on the data ,",
    "the events are added to _",
    "real _ light curves .",
    "the microlensing parameters are drawn uniformly in the following intervals : time of maximum magnification @xmath37 $ ] days , impact parameter normalized to the einstein radius @xmath38 $ ] and time - scale ( einstein radius crossing time ) @xmath39 $ ] days .",
    "we correct for blending statistically , using a study of the typical flux distribution of the source stars which contribute to the flux of a reconstructed star , depending on its position in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    ".impact of each cut on data and simulated events .",
    "each fraction for cut @xmath40 refers to the stars remaining after cut @xmath41 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     model 1 is the `` standard '' halo model : an isotropic and isothermal spherical halo , with a mass distribution given in spherical coordinates by ( caldwell and coulson 1981 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43  kpc is the halo `` core radius '' and @xmath44  kpc is the distance from the sun to the galactic center .",
    "model 2a is the equivalent power - law model ( evans , 1993 ) .",
    "model 2b has a maximal disk ( @xmath45 ) and a very light halo , model 5 intermediate disk and halo .",
    "model 3 has a flattened e6 halo ( axis ratio @xmath46 ) and model 4 a decreasing rotation curve ( @xmath47 where @xmath28 is proportional to the logarithm of the asymptotic slope ) .",
    "models 25 are all power - law halo models , with self - consistent mass and velocity distributions . for each of these",
    ", we derive the expected number of events versus the mass @xmath48 of the objects in the halo ( assuming a dirac mass distribution ) and compare with the observations ( cf figure [ nbevt ] ) .",
    "[ h ]    whatever the halo model considered , the sole event we observed , if caused by a deflector in the halo of our galaxy , corresponds to at least 40% of the total optical depth expected for @xmath49 .",
    "this is a very small number statistics , however .",
    "the very long time - scale of the observed event suggests that it could show measurable distortions in its light curve due to the motion of the earth around the sun , ( the parallax effect : gould 1992 ) , provided that the einstein radius projected onto the plane of the earth is not much larger than the earth orbital radius . the first detection of parallax in a gravitational microlensing event was observed by alcock et al .",
    "the natural parameter to measure the strength of parallax is the semi major axis of the earth orbit , @xmath50 , in units of the projected einstein radius : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the distance from the observer to the deflector and @xmath54 the distance to the source .",
    "no evidence for distortion due to parallax is detectable on the light curve , implying either a very massive deflector with a very large einstein radius , or a deflector near the source . because our results for the standard and blended fits ( see table [ cand1 ] ) agree well with those obtained by the macho collaboration with a 3 year baseline ( alcock et al .",
    "1997b ) , we will fix the level of the baseline flux to that obtained previously with the blended fit , to perform parallax fits .",
    "we fit simultaneously the red and blue light curves allowing for parallax and for the periodic modulation described in section 3 . assuming a blending coefficient @xmath55 , our data allows us to exclude , at the 95% cl , that @xmath56 .",
    "this yields a lower bound on both the projected transverse velocity of the deflector : @xmath57 and on the projected einstein radius : @xmath58 we can thus write : @xmath59 @xmath60 the high projected transverse velocity definitely excludes the possibility that the deflector is in the disk of the milky way , where the typical velocity dispersion is @xmath61km / s ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "moreover , a disk lens ( i.e. @xmath62 ) generating this event would have a mass @xmath63 ! for a deflector in the halo ,",
    "@xmath64 at the 95% confidence level ( for a standard halo ) which requires the mass of the deflector @xmath48 to be at least @xmath65 , while for a deflector in the smc , if @xmath66 , the mass of the lens would be @xmath67 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ par_mx ] .",
    "[ h ]    it is possible for some parallax distortions to be largely cancelled out by blending effects .",
    "however , blending distortions of light curves are always symmetric about the point of highest magnification , while this is not the case , in general , of parallax distortions .",
    "it is only true when the velocity of the deflector is parallel or anti - parallel to the velocity of the earth around the sun at the moment of highest magnification .",
    "figure [ parbl ] illustrates the amount of blending required to compensate the effect of an increasing parallax while remaining compatible with the observed light curve .",
    "all the points plotted yield a @xmath68 for the fit within @xmath15 of the minimum value ( 157/158 ) .",
    "note the two minima regions in the planes shown in the figure , one around an angle of 180 degrees between the projected velocities of the earth and of the deflector ( full markers ) , while the other ( empty markers ) corresponds to a null angle .",
    "the shaded area delimits blending coefficients greater than unity , which is not physical .",
    "as shown in figure [ parbl ] , @xmath69 could be larger than 0.054 , but only in the unlikely case of alignment of velocities .",
    "we built a likelihood based on the fit with parallax , blending and a modulation on the magnified star , taking into account the probability that the alignment of the earth and deflector velocities were parallel or anti - parallel .",
    "this yields the 95% cl upper limit @xmath70 ( which requires a blending coefficient @xmath71 ) .",
    "the projected velocity is then constrained to be at least 190  km / s and equation [ eqpar ] becomes @xmath72 .",
    "if the deflector belongs to the halo of our galaxy , it is expected to have a mass greater than a third of a solar mass ( see sections 5 and 7 ) ; and yet to be dim enough to avoid direct detection , it could only be a white dwarf , a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "it is also possible , however , that both the lensing object and the source star belong to the smc , in which case the deflector would have a much smaller mass .",
    "let us estimate the optical depth for smc self - lensing .",
    "various authors have suggested that the smc is quite elongated along the line - of - sight , with a depth varying from a few kpc ( the tidal radius of the smc is of the order of 4 kpc ) to as much as 20 kpc , depending on the region under study ( hatzidimitriou and hawkins 1989 , caldwell and coulson 1986 , mathewson et al .",
    "we will approximate the smc density profile by a prolate ellipsoid : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is along the line - of - sight and @xmath75 is transverse to the line - of - sight .",
    "the depth @xmath76 will be a free parameter , allowed to vary between 2.5 and 7.5 kpc .",
    "fitting for instance the mathewson et al .",
    "cepheid data ( mathewson et al . 1986 ) in the bar of the smc with the above density distribution gives @xmath77  kpc ( assuming poissonian statistics on the cepheid counts ) .",
    "the other parameters are estimated from the surface - brightness map of de vaucouleurs ( see figure  [ cartesmc ] ) using the identity : @xmath78 derived from @xmath79 , @xmath80 for the sun .",
    "plotting the isophote levels @xmath30 as a function of the mean distance of each isophote to the optical center of the smc ( see figure [ rayonsmc ] ) , we can derive the central surface brightness : @xmath81 .",
    "the slope of the fit yields the value of the radial scale length : @xmath82  kpc .",
    "[ h ]    assuming a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath83 , this gives a central surface density @xmath84 and a total smc mass of @xmath85 , compatible with that estimated from the mass of the lmc considering that the smc is only @xmath86 as bright .",
    "we denote as @xmath87 and @xmath88 the positions of the deflector and the source , both in the smc , with origin taken at the center of the smc .    assuming the same spatial distribution for the source stars and the lenses , the optical depth for smc self - lensing is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the usual optical depth due to source stars all at a distance @xmath88 and deflectors at @xmath87 contained in the elementary volume @xmath91 : @xmath92 for @xmath93 , 5.0 or 7.5 kpc , this yields optical depths @xmath94 , @xmath95 or @xmath96 respectively . considering the very limited statistics we have , this optical depth is consistent with the observations .",
    "let us also consider the expected typical time - scales of smc - smc microlensing events .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the smc is @xmath97  30 km / s ( hatzidimitriou et al . 1997 , suntzeff et al . 1986 ) , so the estimated mass @xmath48 of the deflector causing the observed event ( @xmath98  days ) could be greatly reduced compared to that of a halo deflector . on average , we have : @xmath99 thus , if the deflector is 5 kpc ( resp . 2.5 kpc ) from the source , we have @xmath100 ( resp .",
    "@xmath101 ) .",
    "as more data are accumulated , we expect smc - smc events to be highly concentrated in high density regions of the cloud ( see figure 1 ) , unlike halo events which should be distributed like the smc stars over the sky . in addition",
    ", they should not have measurable parallax distortions .",
    "these criteria will help distinguish between the two possibilities .",
    "we have presented here the result of a one - year survey toward the small magellanic cloud with eros2 .",
    "one star has a light curve that is best interpreted as due to microlensing with an einstein radius crossing time of 123 days when allowing for blending , with 70% of the total baseline flux contributed by the star being lensed .",
    "the light curve exhibits a 2.5% modulation with a period @xmath102  days .",
    "the optical depth estimated from this event is @xmath3 , to be compared with @xmath103 for a spherical isothermal halo containing only such objects .",
    "the most probable mass of the deflector ( if it is in the halo ) would be @xmath104 . if we interpret this event as due to a deflector in the smc , the expected optical depth is @xmath105 for a depth scale - length of the smc of 5  kpc , and the mass of the deflector would be reduced to about @xmath106 . given the very small statistics",
    ", the smc interpretation seems possible .",
    "furthermore , we observe no distortion on the light curve due to the varying velocity of the earth on its orbit around the sun ( parallax ) , although some would have been expected for such a long duration event , unless the deflector were either very heavy or near the source .",
    "this further supports the smc lens interpretation .",
    "further observations will help discriminate halo from cloud deflectors .",
    "in particular , because the velocity dispersions in the lmc and the smc differ by almost a factor of 2 , the observation of a significant trend for longer time - scale events toward the smc than toward the lmc would be a clear signature of events dominated by smc or lmc self - lensing .",
    "we are grateful to d. lacroix and the technical staff at the observatoire de haute provence and to a. baranne for their help in refurbishing the marly telescope and remounting it in la silla .",
    "we are also grateful for the support given to our project by the technical staff at eso , la silla .",
    "we thank j.f .",
    "lecointe for assistance with the online computing .",
    "we also thank the staff of the ccin2p3 , and in particular j. furet , for constant help with the mass production of the data .",
    "we thank the referee for the many improvements he suggested .",
    "after submission of this article , the ogle-2 collaboration confirmed , with their data taken after june 1997 , the modulation we detected .",
    "they also separated the two components of the blend , which allowed them to establish that the modulation affects the magnified component ( udalski et al .",
    "astro - ph/9710365 ) .",
    "the macho collaboration provided us their data on the candidate , which allowed us to confirm the period , @xmath107 days , and the amplitude , @xmath108% , of the modulation ; we thank them for this private communication .",
