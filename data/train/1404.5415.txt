    "the _ wmap _ @xcite spacecraft was designed to measure the full - sky distribution of temperature differences ( anisotropy ) and polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "_ wmap _ is the successor of the legendary _ cosmic background explorer _ ( _ cobe _ ) satellite , whose spectrograph provided a precision - measurement of the cmb blackbody , implying that matter and radiation were in thermal equilibrium , consistent with the expectation of the hot big bang theory of the universe @xcite .",
    "the _ cobe _",
    "differential radiometers discovered the primordial ripples in spacetime that existed in the early universe @xcite . with 35 times better angular resolution and 40 times better sensitivity than _ cobe _ , _ wmap _ took the cosmological research with cmb to the next level .",
    "_ wmap _ was proposed to nasa as a midex ( medium - class explorers ) mission in 1995 .",
    "four of eight co - investigators of _ wmap _ were previously on the _ cobe _ science team . after being selected in 1996 , _ wmap",
    "_ launched on june 30 , 2001 , and arrived in its orbit around the second lagrange point ( l2 ) , 1.5 million kilometers from earth , three months later . since then , _ wmap _ operated almost flawlessly for nine years until it left its l2 orbit on september 8 , 2010 , to pass the baton to its successor , the _ planck",
    "_ satellite , which arrived at l2 in july 2009 .",
    "the _ wmap _ team issued five data releases .",
    "the first - year data release ( february 11 , 2003 ) came with 13 papers @xcite and later with one more paper @xcite ; the third - year data release ( march 16 , 2006 ) came with 4 papers @xcite and later with one more paper @xcite ; the five - year data release ( march 5 , 2008 ) came with 7 papers @xcite and later with one more paper @xcite ; the seven - year data release ( january 25 , 2010 ) came with 6 papers @xcite ; and the final , nine - year data release ( december 21 , 2012 ) came with 2 papers @xcite .",
    "in addition , detailed descriptions of the mission , data processing , calibration , as well as of the data products for each release are given in the explanatory supplement document @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we give a brief review on the _ wmap _ experiment , the data analysis , and the main science results from the nine - year observations .",
    "_ wmap _ measured the distribution of temperature and polarization of the entire sky in five frequency bands ( 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz ) .",
    "five frequencies were necessary to separate the cmb from emission of our own galaxy , including synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission ( see section  [ sec : fg ] for how to reduce the effect of the galactic emission ) .    _ wmap _ has two back - to - back mirrors to focus the incoming electromagnetic waves arriving from two different lines of sight , which are separated by @xmath2 from each other .",
    "the size of each mirror is 1.4  m@xmath3  m , providing substantially better angular resolution than _ cobe _ , which did not have mirrors but only horn antennas .",
    "the incoming waves collected by two mirrors are received by a pair of feed horns .",
    "let us call these two inputs `` a side '' and `` b side . ''",
    "each of the inputs from the a and b sides is separated into two orthogonal polarized waves by orthomode transducers ( omts ) , and then sent to a pair of radiometers .",
    "_ wmap _ has 20 radiometers , or 10 pairs of radiometers .",
    "we call each pair of radiometers a `` differencing assembly '' ( da ) .",
    "there are 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , and 4 das at 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz , respectively . each da measures temperature and polarization differences between the a and b sides",
    "each of 20 radiometers processes inputs from the a and b sides as follows ( section  2.3 of @xcite )    * the inputs are separated into two linear combinations , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . *",
    "these linear combinations are amplified by high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifiers , yielding @xmath6g_1,\\qquad          u_2\\equiv \\left[\\frac{a - b}{\\sqrt{2}}+n_2\\right]g_2 ,         \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the noise added by the amplifiers , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the gains of the amplifiers . * the latter combination , @xmath11 , is phased - switched to yield @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath13 and the phase - switched @xmath11 are combined to form @xmath14 and @xmath15 . *",
    "the combined signals are detected by the square - law detectors ( diodes ) .",
    "the outputs , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are proportional to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . * finally , we compute the difference between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , obtaining @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the proportionality constant of the square - law detector .",
    "this quantity is thus proportional to the _ difference _ between the powers of light coming from the a and b sides ; i.e. , _ wmap _ measures temperature differences in the sky separated by @xmath2 , and the mean cmb temperature ( 2.725  k ) and many types of undesirable systematic effects cancel out .",
    "we need to convert the measured @xmath22 ( in units of voltages ) to a temperature difference in thermodynamic units .",
    "we do this by using the dipole anisotropy of the cmb . as earth orbits around sun ,",
    "the l2 point ( hence _ wmap _ ) also orbits around sun at 30  km / s .",
    "this motion creates time - varying dipole anisotropy , creating a sinusoidal signal changing over a year . as we know the mean cmb temperature and the orbital velocity precisely , we know that the amplitude of this signal must be @xmath23 .",
    "this fixes the proportionality constant between @xmath22 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the temperatures toward the a and b sides , respectively .",
    "the polarization information is still entangled in @xmath24 measured by each radiometer . to measure polarization , we need to combine the measurements of a pair of radiometers forming each da .",
    "let us define @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the outputs of two radiometers .",
    "the action of omts gives ( equations  10 and 11 of @xcite ) @xmath31 here , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the stokes parameters describing the incoming waves from the a side .",
    "we define the stokes @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that the polarization directions of a pure @xmath35 signal are parallel to either galactic longitudes or latitudes , and the polarization directions of a pure @xmath36 signal are 45 degrees tilted from those of a pure @xmath35 signal .",
    "in other words , a pure @xmath35 signal aligns with either the galactic north - south or east - west direction ( see figure  [ fig : stokes ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath37 is the angle between a meridian through the galactic poles and the projection of the electric field of each output port of the omts on the sky .",
    "the sum and difference of the instantaneous outputs of two radiometers thus yield @xmath38 the sum gives the temperature difference ( i.e. , difference of unpolarized intensities ) , while the difference gives a combination of the stokes @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the polarization angles of radiometers were measured on the ground using a polarized source .",
    "the uncertainty of the measurement is @xmath39 ( section 2.5 of @xcite ) , and the measurements are within @xmath40 of the design orientation ( section 3 of @xcite ) . in flight , we observe tau a @xcite , and find that the standard deviation of angles measured in five bands is @xmath41 ( see table 15 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with ( and is smaller than ) the scatter of the ground measurements and we conservatively use @xmath42 as an estimate of the systematic error in the polarization angle of _",
    "the instantaneous outputs of two radiometers per da yield the temperature and polarization differences between the a and b sides .",
    "the next step is to reconstruct the distribution of temperature ( minus the mean cmb temperature ) and polarization over the entire sky .",
    "_ wmap _ scans the full sky in six months .",
    "we can then estimate maps of temperature and polarization over the full sky using the six - month data .",
    "we first write down the measured time - ordered data ( tod ) as ( section  3.4 of @xcite ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the tod of two radiometers , @xmath45 , measured at a given observation time , @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the actual sky map consisting of @xmath48 at a given sky location ( pixel ) , @xmath49 ; @xmath50 is noise of the tod ; and @xmath51 is the so - called `` mapping matrix '' which projects @xmath47 onto @xmath44 .    for an ideal differential experiment ,",
    "the mapping matrix is a @xmath52 matrix , where @xmath53 is the number of data - recording times and @xmath54 is the number of sky pixels .",
    "each row corresponds to one observation , while each column corresponds to a map pixel .",
    "each row of @xmath51 has 6 non - zero elements .",
    "the non - zero elements are @xmath55 in the columns corresponding to the observed pixels in the @xmath56 map ; and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 maps .",
    "the plus and minus signs are chosen according to equations  ( [ eq : d1 ] ) and ( [ eq : d2 ] ) .",
    "each observation is associated with 12 non - zero values of @xmath51 that are distributed in two rows .    in reality , there are two dominant nonidealities in radiometers that must be taken into account .",
    "one is the `` bandpass mismatch . ''",
    "we take the difference between two radiometers to measure polarization . while these radiometers were designed and built to have nearly identical frequency responses ( bandpass ) to the incoming electromagnetic waves , a slight mismatch in the bandpass produces a spurious polarization signal even in the absence of polarization .",
    "suppose that the incoming waves are unpolarized and have a spectrum of @xmath61 .",
    "due to the bandpass mismatch of two radiometers , they receive the incoming waves at slightly different effective frequencies , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . as a result ,",
    "the difference between two radiometers does not vanish , producing a spurious polarization , @xmath21 , given by @xmath64 . while the cmb , whose temperature does not depend on frequencies , does not produce a spurious polarization , the other components ( such as galactic emission ) that depend on frequencies do produce a spurious polarization .",
    "fortunately , it is relatively straightforward to remove this effect .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : d1 ] ) and ( [ eq : d2 ] ) show that the real polarization signals are modulated by the angle @xmath65 . on the other hand ,",
    "a spurious polarization is independent of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , we can separate the real and spurious polarization signals if we have enough coverage in @xmath65 .",
    "we modify equations  ( [ eq : d1 ] ) and ( [ eq : d2 ] ) as ( equations 17 and 18 of @xcite ) @xmath66 and expand the mapping matrix to a @xmath67 matrix .",
    "( each row has 8 non - zero elements . )",
    "while _ wmap _ s scan pattern allows for a uniform coverage in @xmath65 near the ecliptic poles , it covers only 30% of possible @xmath65 on the ecliptic plane .",
    "this produces noisy modes in the reconstructed sky maps , which must be properly de - weighted .",
    "( by comparison , _ planck _",
    "s coverage is @xmath68% on the ecliptic plane . )",
    "the second non - ideality is the `` transmission imbalance , '' which is the difference between the a and b sides ; namely , the a and b sides do not necessarily have equal responses to the incoming waves due to loss ( i.e. , imperfect transmission ) in the system .",
    "the spurious polarization is an additive effect , but the transmission imbalance is a multiplicative effect , given by ( equations 19 and 20 of @xcite ) @xmath69\\\\ \\label{eq : d1ss } & & -(1-x_{im})[i_b+q_b\\cos 2\\gamma_b+u_b\\sin 2\\gamma_b+s_b],\\\\ \\nonumber   d_2&= & ( 1+x_{im})[i_a - q_a\\cos 2\\gamma_a - u_a\\sin   2\\gamma_a - s_a]\\\\ \\label{eq : d2ss } & & -(1-x_{im})[i_b - q_b\\cos 2\\gamma_b - u_b\\sin 2\\gamma_b - s_b ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the transmission imbalance factor , which has been measured using the responses of radiometers to the cmb dipole ( table 2 of @xcite ) . we include the transmission imbalance in the mapping matrix by multiplying the a- and b - side elements by @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .    the optimal estimator for a sky map , @xmath73 , that is unbiased and has the minimum variance , is given by ( in matrix notation ) @xmath74 where @xmath75  @xmath76 is the noise matrix of the tod .",
    "the tod noise of _ wmap _ is stationary , in a sense that the noise matrix is a function of @xmath77 .",
    "the noise matrix is given by @xmath78 with ( equation 21 of @xcite ) @xmath79^{-1}d\\omega+k\\right\\ } , & \\delta t<\\delta",
    "t_{\\rm max},\\\\ 0 , & \\delta t\\ge \\delta t_{\\rm max } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is in units of samples , and @xmath81 is the time lag at which the tod noise correlation function ( @xmath82 in the integral ) crosses zero , typically @xmath83  seconds .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are chosen such that @xmath86 is normalized to unity , and that the mean of @xmath87 over @xmath88 vanishes .",
    "the tod noise correlation function , @xmath82 , is measured from the data and a functional form is given in equation  ( 4 ) of @xcite . given this noise matrix of the tod",
    ", we solve the equation , @xmath89 , to find a sky map solution , @xmath90 , using the conjugate gradient method .    as described in section  [ sec : temp ] , we use the cmb dipole to convert the input signals ( in voltages ) to thermodynamic temperatures .",
    "the uncertainty in this conversion ( calibration uncertainty ) per da is 0.2% for the final nine - year temperature and polarization maps , which has unchanged since the five - year analysis ( section  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wmap9_temp ] shows the nine - year solutions to the full - sky @xmath56 maps ( minus dipole anisotropy ) , while figures  [ fig : wmap9_q ] and [ fig : wmap9_u ] show the stokes @xmath35 and @xmath36 maps , respectively , in five frequency bands .",
    "maps in five frequency bands measured by _ wmap _",
    "( adapted from @xcite ) .",
    "maps are smoothed to a common gaussian beam of 2 degrees to suppress noise .",
    "see figure  [ fig : stokes ] for the correspondence between the signs of @xmath35 and polarization directions.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]     but for stokes @xmath36.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "figure  [ fig : wmap9_temp ] shows that the distribution of the measured temperatures at high frequencies ( 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz ) at high galactic latitudes are quite similar .",
    "this means that , at these frequencies , the temperature data at high galactic latitudes are dominated by the cmb which is independent of frequencies . on the other hand ,",
    "the data at lower frequencies ( 23 and 33  ghz ) are clearly affected by strong galactic emission , and the data near the galactic plane are dominated by the galactic emission at all five frequencies .",
    "also , there are many extra - galactic sources ( most of which are synchrotron sources ) all over the sky , which need to be removed from the cosmological analysis .    to reduce the effects of the so - called `` foreground '' emission from our galaxy and extra - galactic sources , we combine two methods : one is to simply mask the pixels which are strongly affected by the foreground emission ; and the other is to estimate and remove the foreground emission from the sky maps .    three galactic foreground components are known to dominate in the _ wmap _ frequencies ( section  3 of @xcite ) : synchrotron , free - free , and dust .",
    "the antenna temperatures of these three components go ( very approximately ) as @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , respectively . as a result",
    ", synchrotron dominates at the lowest frequencies ( 23 and 33  ghz ) , free - free dominates in some regions in the sky at the intermediate frequencies ( 41 and 61  ghz ) , and dust dominates at the highest frequency ( 94  ghz ) .",
    "we define the mask for the temperature data as follows ( section  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we first smooth the 23  ghz ( k band ) map to one degree resolution , and remove an estimate of the cmb from this map .",
    "the cmb is estimated by the internal linear combination ( ilc ) method ( section  5.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we then mask the pixels brighter than a certain threshold temperature , until 75% or 85% of the sky is left unmasked .",
    "we repeat the same procedure for the 41  ghz ( q band ) map .",
    "the masks defined by the k- and q - band maps are added to form two masks , `` kq75 '' and `` kq85 '' masks , depending on how much sky was left unmasked in the k- or q - band map .",
    "the mask for extra - galactic sources is created using the locations of the known bright radio sources in the literature ( as described in section  7 of @xcite ) , the sources found in the _ wmap _ nine - year data ( section  5.2.2 of @xcite ) , and additional sources found in the _ planck _ early release compact source catalog at 100  ghz @xcite .",
    "an exclusion radius of 1.2 degree is used for sources brighter than 5  jy in any _ wmap _ band , and an exclusion radius of 0.6 degree is used for fainter sources .    to further reduce foreground emission in unmasked pixels , we estimate the distribution of the diffuse galactic foreground emission over the full sky and remove it from the _ wmap _ maps .",
    "we use the difference between the 23 and 33  ghz maps ( which does not contain the cmb ) for synchrotron emission ; a map of h@xmath94 @xcite corrected for extinction and scattering ( section  5.3.1 of @xcite ) for free - free emission ; and a map of dust emission @xcite .",
    "these three maps are simultaneously fit to and removed from the 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz maps , yielding the foreground - reduced maps at these frequencies .",
    "finally , we slightly enlarge the kq75 and kq85 masks by further masking the regions which have significant excess in the differences between the foreground - reduced 41 and 61  ghz maps , and 61 and 94  ghz maps .",
    "the resulting nine - year temperature masks , `` kq75y9 '' and `` kq85y9 , '' retain 68.8% and 74.8% of the sky , respectively .",
    "the former is used for testing gaussianity of the temperature data , while the latter is used for the power spectrum analysis .      figures  [ fig : wmap9_q ] and [ fig : wmap9_u ] show that the polarization maps at low frequencies are dominated by the galactic emission .",
    "we thus mask the regions strongly contaminated by foreground emission , and remove an estimate of the foreground emission from unmasked pixels .",
    "two polarized foreground components are known to dominate in the _ wmap _ frequencies @xcite : synchrotron and dust .",
    "therefore , one might think that reducing foreground in polarization is easier than in temperature , as we have fewer foreground components .",
    "in reality , the polarization analysis is more challenging because the cmb signal in polarization is 10 times fainter than in temperature . while the polarized foreground emission is clearly seen in figures  [ fig : wmap9_q ] and [ fig : wmap9_u ] , there is no clear evidence for the cmb signals ; thus , we need more sophisticated statistical analysis to extract faint polarization signals of the cmb .",
    "we define the mask of polarization maps using the 23  ghz map ( which is dominated by synchrotron ) and a model of dust emission @xcite .",
    "we first create lower resolution @xmath35 and @xmath36 maps at the 23  ghz , each containing 3072 pixels .",
    "we then compute the total polarization intensity , @xmath95 . as the presence of noise produces a small positive bias in this quantity , we remove it using our estimate of noise in the maps . finally , we mask the pixels that are brighter than a certain threshold polarization intensity .",
    "we choose the threshold to be 0.6 times the mean polarization intensity , and call this mask the `` p06 '' mask . as for dust",
    ", we use a map of dust emission constructed from the _ wmap _ temperature data using maximum entropy method ( mem ) ( section  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "we choose a threshold in this map to be 0.5 times the maximum value found in the polar caps ( @xmath96 degrees ) , and mask the pixels brighter than this threshold value .",
    "we then add this dust mask to the p06 mask .",
    "we find that extra - galactic sources are minimally polarized in the _ wmap _ frequencies ; thus , we only mask ten bright sources outside of the p06 mask @xcite .",
    "the combined p06 mask including synchrotron , dust , and extra - galactic sources retains 73.2% of the sky for the cosmological analysis .",
    "to further reduce foreground emission in unmasked pixels , we use the 23  ghz polarization maps to trace synchrotron . as for dust",
    ", we use ( equation  15 of @xcite ) @xmath97,\\\\   u_{\\rm dust}(\\hat{n})&=&i_{\\rm dust}(\\hat{n})g_{\\rm    dust}(\\hat{n})\\sin[2\\gamma_{\\rm dust}(\\hat{n})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the same dust map that we used for the temperature analysis @xcite . dust emission",
    "is polarized because dust grains are not spherical , and are aligned with coherent magnetic fields in our galaxy such that the semi - major axes of grains are perpendicular to the fields . as a result , the polarization directions of dust emission are perpendicular to the field directions .",
    "the dust polarization we observe along a particular line of sight is the projection of multiple polarization signals along the line of sight , which is affected by geometry of the fields .",
    "we take this projection effect into account by the function @xmath99 , which is calculated using a simple model of fields given in section  4.1 of @xcite .",
    "how do we estimate @xmath100 ? as the polarization directions of synchrotron are also perpendicular to the field directions , we could take the polarization directions at 23  ghz as an estimate for @xmath100 ; however , alignment of dust grains with the fields is not necessarily perfect , which yields some differences between @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    ". therefore , we use the polarization directions measured toward stars .",
    "while the intrinsic starlight is usually unpolarized ( or polarized very weakly ) , the observed starlight can be polarized due to selective extinction of the starlight when it passes through regions with dust grains . as it gets more extinction along the semi - major axes of dust grains , the observed starlight polarization direction is precisely orthogonal to the polarization direction of dust emission from the same location .",
    "we have compiled the existing measurements of starlight polarization in the literature ( section  4.1.2 of @xcite ) , and created a map of the starlight polarization directions , @xmath102 .",
    "we then compute the dust polarization direction as @xmath103 .",
    "the correlation between @xmath100 computed in this way and @xmath101 shows that these two angles typically agree to 20 degrees .",
    "we simultaneously fit the 23  ghz polarization maps and dust polarization maps to reduce polarized foregrounds from the higher frequency maps at 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz . due to much lower signal - to - noise ratios in the polarization maps ,",
    "removal of the polarized foreground presents a great challenge to the _ wmap _ analysis .",
    "the error in the foreground removal has a non - negligible impact on the inferred value of the optical depth to the thomson scattering , @xmath104 .",
    "for example , an alternative foreground removal method presented in @xcite shifts the value of @xmath104 as much as the 1-@xmath105 statistical uncertainty .",
    "the steps we have described so far give us foreground - reduced temperature maps at 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz , and foreground - reduced polarization maps at 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz .",
    "the temperature maps come with the kq75 and kq85 masks depending on the purpose of the cosmological analysis , and the polarization maps come with the p06 mask . in this section , we describe how to measure the angular power spectra from these maps .      assuming that the distribution of cmb temperatures in the foreground - reduced maps outside the mask is given by a gaussian distribution , which is a good approximation as described in section  [ sec : ng ] , a complete description of the measured cmb temperatures is given by the following probability density distribution function ( pdf ) : @xmath106}{\\sqrt{\\det[2\\pi(s+n ) ] } } , \\label{eq : pdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the difference between the cmb temperature toward a direction ( or a sky pixel ) @xmath108 and the mean cmb temperature , @xmath109  k , with an extra index @xmath110 denoting a da and an observed period ( e.g. , first year , second year , etc ) .",
    "the total covariance matrix consists of the signal matrix , @xmath111 , and the noise matrix , @xmath112 . these matrices are @xmath113 matrices , where @xmath114 is the number of pixels , @xmath115 is the number of das used for the temperature analysis ( 2 at 61  ghz and 4 at 94  ghz ) , and @xmath116 is the number of years . for _ wmap",
    "_ , the noise matrix vanishes unless @xmath117 , i.e. , noise is uncorrelated between different das or years .    as _ wmap",
    "_ is a differential experiment measuring temperature differences between two points separated by 141 degrees , there is a pixel - to - pixel noise correlation at 141 degrees ( figure  11 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , this correlation has a negligible influence on the temperature analysis , as the signal covariance due to the cmb totally dominates at large angular scales where this pixel correlation is important .",
    "we thus have a simple description of the noise matrix : @xmath118 ^ 2}{n_{{\\rm obs},i}^{(a)}}\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ab},\\ ] ] where @xmath119 sets the overall noise level per da per observation , and @xmath120 gives the corresponding effective number of observations in a sky pixel @xmath108 .",
    "we also set the noise matrix to have a large value in the masked pixels , i.e. , we effectively set the noise level to be infinity at the masked pixels .",
    "the cmb signal matrix is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the temperature power spectrum of the cmb , and @xmath123 is the so - called `` beam transfer function , '' which is the legendre transform of a symmetrized beam profile of a given da , and @xmath124 is the usual legendre polynomials .",
    "an additional smearing due to pixelization may also be included in @xmath123 .",
    "the beam transfer functions of all das are determined by the repeated observations of jupiter and the full physical modeling of the optical system of _ wmap _ @xcite .",
    "two jupiter observing seasons of @xmath125 days each occur every 395400 days , and we had 17 seasons of the jupiter data over nine years of operation .",
    "the jupiter data are used to determine the inner beam profiles directly out to radii at which the antenna gains drop to 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , and 9 dbi ( or @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath129  db ) at 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz , respectively ( section  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "then , the physical optics modeling is used from the inner beams out to 7.0 , 5.5 , 5.0 , 4.0 , and 3.5 degrees from the beam center at 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 , and 94  ghz , respectively .",
    "the beam response at greater distances from the beam center ( i.e. , far sidelobes ) has been measured on the ground before launch and in - flight using moon @xcite .",
    "the accurate determination of the beam transfer functions is crucial for the accurate recovery of the intrinsic cmb power spectrum , @xmath122 , as the errors we make in @xmath123 propagate directly into @xmath122 .",
    "we estimate that the 1-@xmath105 uncertainty in the recovered @xmath122 from the nine - year data due to the uncertainty in the beam transfer functions is 0.6% at @xmath130 .",
    "this uncertainty is coherent ( correlated ) over a wide range in @xmath131 , and must be included in the cosmological analysis of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "how do we infer cosmological parameters from the cmb maps ?",

    "the so - called `` local - form bispectrum , '' parametrized by a non - linear parameter @xmath260 @xcite , carries a special significance , as detection of a large local - form bispectrum would rule out all inflation models based on a single energy component with a bunch - davies initial vacuum state and an attractor solution ( see @xcite for the latest discussion on this theorem ) .",
    "this triangle has the largest amplitude in the `` squeezed configurations '' in which one of the wavenumbers , say @xmath259 , is much smaller than the other two , i.e. , @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "detailed descriptions on what this bispectrum is and what the other shapes are , as well as on how to measure them can be found in @xcite .",

    "one way to generate the local - form bispectrum is to write the primordial curvature perturbation as @xmath264 .",

    ", @xmath270 , implies that the observed cmb is gaussian to the precision of 0.04% or better . this is a remarkable degree of gaussianity , which provides strong evidence that the observed cmb fluctuations originate from quantum fluctuations generated during single - field inflation",
    "models of inflation @xcite make specific , testable predictions .",
    "the simplest models based upon a single energy component ( scalar field ) , which slowly rolls down on its potential and drives a sustained quasi - exponential expansion for at least 50 @xmath249-folds , predict that the observable universe is homogeneous and isotropic with flat geometry , and is filled with small fluctuations which are precisely adiabatic and nearly gaussian ( before fluctuations become non - linear ) . both scalar and tensor",
    "fluctuations with various wavelengths are generated during inflation .",
    "the wavelengths of these fluctuations can exceed the horizon size at the decoupling epoch , and the amplitude of these fluctuations weakly depends on wavelengths .",
    "_ all _ of these predictions fit the _ wmap _ data remarkably well : flatness is measured with 0.4% precision ( from _ wmap _ combined with the baryon acoustic oscillation and the local hubble constant measurements ) ; the adiabatic condition holds to better than 7% precision ; a deviation from gaussian fluctuations is restricted to be less than 0.2% ( and 0.04% with the _ planck _ 2013 data ) ; and the presence of super - horizon fluctuations at decoupling is decisively detected in the te cross power spectrum at @xmath188 .",
    "the _ wmap _ data combined with the baryon acoustic oscillation and the local hubble constant measurements find convincing evidence for the scale dependence of the scalar initial power spectrum with 4.9@xmath105 significance , with the best - fit value in agreement with the first prediction made in @xcite .",
    "while _ wmap _ did not find signatures of tensor fluctuations , the upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio inferred from the temperature data is consistent with many single - field inflation models .",
