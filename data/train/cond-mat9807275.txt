    "the fascinating discoveries of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) originally found in single two dimensional electron layers , have also been extended to double layer systems , thanks to the development of techniques for growing gaas heterostructures containing two separated layers of two - dimensional electron gas ( see for example references @xcite ) .",
    "apart from finding plateaus in hall conductivity at total filling fractions @xmath2 corresponding to the `` direct sum '' of the familiar integral and odd - denominator fractional qhe in the individual single layers , experiments also show the occurence of new plateaus which are intrinsic to double - layer systems and rely on interlayer quantum coherence and correlations . on the theoretical front , a large body of work",
    "has already been done on double - layer systems .",
    "an extensive list of references to this literature has been given in the lucid review of this subject by girvin and macdonald @xcite and in the paper by moon @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "generally one analyses double layer systems by attributing to the electrons , in addition to their spatial coordinates on the plane , a two - component `` pseudospin '' whose up and down components refer to the amplitude for the electron to be in the first and second layers respectively .",
    "the real physical spin of the electrons is assumed , as a staring approximation , to be fully polarised by the strong magnetic field and hence frozen as a degree of freedom .",
    "however , even when real physical spin is suppressed , the use of a pseudospin to represent the layer degree of freedom maps the double layer spinless problem into a monolayer problem with spin @xcite .",
    "such a mapping allows one to borrow for double layer systems , the rich body of insights and results available from single layer systems with real spin .",
    "thus one may expect a fully symmetric ( polarised ) pseudospin state to be energetically preferred because of a combination of coulomb repulsion and the pauli principle which forces an associated antisymmetric spatial wavefunction , just as in itenerant ferromagnetism .",
    "further , the relevance of skyrmions to systems with real spin , predicted by theoretical considerations @xcite , @xcite and supported by experimental evidence @xcite , has in turn prompted studies of similar topological excitations in spinless double layer systems , but now involving pseudospin ( see girvin and macdonald @xcite , moon @xmath3 @xcite and references given therein ) .",
    "because of interplane - intraplane anisotropy in coulomb repulsion between electrons located in the two layers , as well the capacitance energy of maintaining unequal charge density in the two layers , the effective action governing pseudospin enjoys only u(1 ) symmetry of rotations about the z - axis ( the direction perpendicular to the x - y plane of the layers ) .",
    "finiteness of the capacitance energy between the two layers requires that asymptotically the pseudospin must lie on the easy ( x - y ) plane .",
    "the basic topological excitations in that case are the so - called merons which are vortices in pseudospin with a winding number of one - half ( with respect to the second homotopy group @xmath4 .",
    "these are similar to vortices in the x - y model , but non singular at the origin since the pseudospin is not restricted to lie on the x - y plane .",
    "but like the former they do have an energy that grows logarithmically with size .",
    "one can also have meron anti - meron bound pairs whose energy is finite .",
    "such a pair is topologically equivalent to skyrmions and carries unit winding number .",
    "( for an introduction to such topological excitations , their winding numbers , etc . see reference @xcite . )",
    "the possibilty of topological excitations like merons and bimerons in double layer systems has generated much interest , in part because of the excitement surrounding the skyrmion excitations in systems with real spin , and in part because of the additional possibility here of kosterlitz - thoulles type @xcite phase transitions caused by the break - up of bound bimerons into separated meron pairs @xcite,@xcite .",
    "bimeron solutions have already been extensively studied in a body of papers by girvin , macdonald and co - workers @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on optimising microscopic wavefunctions with respect to the microscopic interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we will also calculate bimeron solutions and their energies here , but by using an alternate method .",
    "an effective action for slowly varying pseudospin textures has already been obtained by moon et al @xcite . if one extremises that action one will get differential equations which the unit - vector valued field of psuedo spin configurations @xmath5 should obey in the classical limit .",
    "in this paper we solve these coupled non - linear differential equations , through a combination of analytically motivated ansatze followed by numerical calculations .",
    "we obtain bimerons as approximate time - independent solutions with appropriate topologically non - trivial boundary conditions , for a range of separations between the meron and its partner the anti - meron and also for a set of different inter - layer distances .",
    "the dependence of the bimeron texture on these variables is discussed .",
    "they turn out to be reasonably similar to what one would expect on general grounds .",
    "we also obtain the energy of this bimeron as a function of the separation between the meron centers .",
    "we include in this energy contributions coming from the pseudospin stiffness , its anisotropy , the capacitance energy and the coulomb energy . by minimising this energy with respect to the meron separation , we are also able to give an independent value for the optimal meron separation in a bimeron .",
    "we compare these results with earlier work , including our own .    apart from this",
    ", our work also enables us to independently check the validity of a physical picture often used @xcite in estimating bimeron energies , namely , that they can be viewed as a pair of rigid objects carrying electric charge of @xmath6 and a logarithmically growing energy . a work somewhat similar in spirit to ours , but in the context of skyrmions of real spin systems was done by abolfath @xmath7 who compared results obtained from solving a non - linear differential equation with those obtained from microscopic calculations @xcite . for yet another way of approaching meron solutions , starting from a chern- simons field theory see the work of ichinose and sekiguchi @xcite .    in an earlier paper @xcite",
    "we had done a similar study of single meron solutions .",
    "but the present work is much more complicated at the computational level .",
    "single meron solutions are circularly symmetric , with the spin component on the plane pointing along the coordinate direction . thus the only unknown",
    ", namely , the spin - z component obeys an ordinary ( though non - linear ) differential equation in the radius variable @xmath8 .",
    "further , the boundary conditions relevant to a single meron can be imposed , conveniently , at the end points @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "by contrast the boundary conditions characterising a bimeron are @xmath11 at two finite points on the plane where the two merons have their centers .",
    "the spin direction is also not simply related to the coordinate direction , so that there are two independent fields , say , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , ( since the @xmath14 is constrained to be a unit vector ) which obey coupled partial differential equations on the plane .",
    "we found it quite challenging to analyse these coupled equations analytically as far as posible , and use that information to employ an appropriate ansatz and coordinate system to numerically solve the equtions ( using a desk - top computer ) .",
    "finally , we should reiterate that our work here clearly relies heavily on the advances already made by the indiana group @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and is to be viewed as something which will hopefully augment their findings .",
    "the differential equations obeyed by spin textures is obtained by extremising an effective action which has already been derived by moon _",
    "et al _ @xcite starting from the basic microscopic physics .",
    "see also ezawa @xcite .",

    "@xmath15 is the coordinate on the x - y plane carrying the layers , while the magnetic field b is along the z - direction .",
    "the fully polarised `` ferromagnetic '' ground state corresponds to @xmath14 pointing everywhere in the same direction , say , along the x - axis . using this as the reference state , any other state with some arbitrary texture @xmath5 is given by performing a local pseudospin rotation on this uniform ground state .",

    "to find bimeron solutions we have to numerically solve the coupled partial differential equations ( pde ) in ( [ mz ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "the defining boundary condition of a bimeron is @xmath28 at the points @xmath29 our strategy will be to use the known exact solution of these equations in the non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) limit , and solve the full equations iteratively starting with the nlsm solution .",
    "the nlsm limit is realised when the layer separation @xmath30 goes to zero in which case we see from their defining equations above that @xmath31 , i.e. the stiffness is isotropic and further that the capacitance coefficient @xmath32 vanishes . then , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 also neglected , the action in ( [ eff ] ) is just that of the nlsm , all of whose solutions are exactly known @xcite .",
    "they are conveniently described by the complex field w(z ) which represents the stereographic projection of the unit sphere of textures @xmath14 .",
    "it is defined by w(z ) where z = x+iy .",
    "our texture variables @xmath12 and @xmath27 are related to w(z ) by m_z  & = &  |w|^2 - 1 |w|^2 + 1 + and  & = &  arg  ( w ) [ mzw ] any analytic function w(z ) will be a solution of the nlsm .",
    "in particular the function w(z )  =  z - a z + a [ nlsm ] represents the bimeron , with the points ( 0,-a ) and ( 0,a ) representing the centers of the two merons , where the solution gives @xmath11 respectively .",
    "it may be checked that ( [ nlsm ] ) satisfies the coupled equations ( [ mz ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) in the isotropic limit .    when the interlayer separation d is not zero , we have to cope with the coupled field equations ( [ mz ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) with both the anisotropic stiffness and capacitance terms present .",
    "some analysis of this system was done long ago by ogilvie and guralnik @xcite who studied the nlsm with the mass ( capacitance ) term included but no anisotropy .",

    "both made considerable progress analytically , but neither offered exact or numerical solutions . here we will try to solve ( [ mz ] ) and ( [ alpha ] ) numerically after including both the capacitance and anisotropic terms .",
    "to do so , it will be convenient to use a bipolar coordinate system to describe the x - y plane , as might be expected when we have to impose boudary conditions at two finite points ( 0,-a ) and ( 0,a ) .",
    "these coordinates , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are defined by   ln  |z - a z+a| + and   arg  ( z - a z+a ) [ etaphi ] this coordinate set has many advantages @xcite . the points ( 0,-a ) and ( 0,a ) at which we have to impose boundary conditions are now mapped into @xmath35 .",
    "the full x - y plane is mapped in @xmath36 coordinates to an infinite strip with @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "finally , it is clear upon comparing eq([etaphi ] ) to eq ( [ nlsm ] ) that this set of coordinates is closely related to the exact nlsm bimeron solution",

    "now let us analyse these equations as different terms are included in stages .",
    "\\(a ) in the nlsm limit , our exact solution has @xmath39 .",
    "then ( [ alpha1 ] ) forces @xmath12 to be a function of @xmath33 alone , @xmath40 . upon inserting this into the other equation ( [ mz1 ] )",
    "it becomes an _",
    "ordinary _ non - linear differential equation .",
    "this is the advantage of this choice of coordinates .",
    "the solution can be verified to be @xmath41 .",
    "\\(b ) next let us include anisotropy @xmath42 , while still keeping the capacitance term zero @xmath43 .",
    "once again we can set @xmath39 , and consequently @xmath44 , which will obey again an ordinary differential equation given by   ( _ ^2  m_z ) + + m_z + = 0 [ mz2 ]    this has no analytic solution , but can be solved relatively easily numerically , being just an ordinary differential equation in the variable @xmath33 . as boundary conditions we impose @xmath45    at @xmath46 and @xmath47 at @xmath48 , (",
    "note that the equation above is symmetric under @xmath49 , so that we can choose the solution to be antisymmetric , i.e. @xmath50 ) .",
    "the resulting numerical solutions for different values of layer separation @xmath30 ( on which the anisotropy depends ) , are shown in fig 1 .",
    "one can see that with increasing the layer separation , and hence increasing anisotropy in the stiffness , the pseudospin component @xmath51 reaches its asymptotic value more slowly .",
    "\\(c ) finally let us also include the capacitance term and consider the equations ( [ mz1 ] and [ alpha1 ] ) in full .",
    "now the ansatz @xmath39 is no longer sustainable , in contrast to what has been suggested in ref ( @xcite ) .",
    "the substitution of the ansatz @xmath52 in equation ( [ alpha1 ] ) would again force @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "but now this is in contradiction with equation ( [ mz1 ] ) which has an explicit @xmath55 dependence through the last ( capacitance ) term @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , once one includes the capacitance term in equation([mz1 ] ) both @xmath27 and @xmath51 become functions of both @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "one has unavoidably to solve the coupled non - linear pde for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we do this by employing what we believe is a good ansatz for @xmath27 which approximately satisfies [ alpha1 ] ) .",
    "we then solve the other equation ( [ mz1 ] ) numerically after inserting that ansatz for @xmath27 .",
    "our ansatz is been motivated by the following arguments .",
    "one can see from equation([mz1 ] ) that the troublesome @xmath34 dependent term @xmath59 is negligibly small in the large @xmath33 region @xmath60 and is most dominant in the small @xmath33 region .",
    "hence @xmath27 will still approach @xmath34 as @xmath61 but needs to be modified substantially in the small @xmath33 region where however @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath62 equation ( [ alpha1 ] ) can be approximated by ^2=0 [ laplace]this is just laplace s equation in two dimension whose solutions are all harmonic functions . with this in mind",
    "we choose our ansatz for @xmath27 as follows : = -b exp(-||)sin ( ) [ alpha2]where ( ) ^12  a     this solves laplace s equation and satisfies all the required boundary conditions and asymptotic behaviour , namely @xmath63 .",
    "note that the ansatz has a cusp at @xmath46 .",
    "this need not cause concern .",
    "some such cusps can be expected on physical grounds and are familiar in soliton physics .",
    "the point is that each meron feels some force due to the other ( coulomb plus a logarithmic force ) at arbitrary separation .",
    "we would expect them to move because of this force , and can not strictly speaking expect a static bimeron solution to exist at arbitrary separation . but a cusp , like the one in the above ansatz , amounts to a delta function in the second derivative and can be interpreted as a external force just at @xmath46 which can `` hold the two merons together '' at arbitrary separation . for more discussion of this point see rajaraman and perring and skyrme @xcite where this technique was used to get intersoliton forces betwen one dimensional solitons .",
    "the constant b is chosen by minimising the energy . substituting this ansatz in equation ( [ mz1 ] ) we then solved it numerically subject to the boundary condition @xmath64 .",
    "it is sufficient to solve the equation in the first quadrant .i.e .",
    "@xmath65 and \\phi [ 0,\\pi])$ ] . for the rest of the quadrants solutions can be obtained by writing @xmath66 which is consistent with the invariance of equations ( [ mz1])and([alpha1 ] ) under the transformation @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "before proceeding to solve this pde ( [ mz1 ] ) we must take note of the fact that the last term of the equation ( [ mz1 ] ) is singular at the point @xmath69 .",
    "this point corresponds to spatial infinity on the parent x - y plane .",
    "as one moves near this point the leading singularity in the equation , coming from the @xmath59 term , goes like @xmath70 with other subleading singuarities of the form @xmath71 .",
    "it can be seen that this leading singularity can be offset by requiring that @xmath51 behave as @xmath72 \\",
    "g ( \\eta,\\phi)$ ] , where this @xmath73 , is a more smooth function for which one solves numerically .",
    "this corresponds , in more familiar polar coordinates @xmath74 to writing @xmath12 in the form @xmath75 $ ]  @xmath76 . that @xmath12 will suffer such an exponential fall - off as @xmath77",
    "can also be inferred directly from the `` mass term '' @xmath78 in the original field equation ( [ mz ] ) .",
    "similarly one can also verify that the cancellation of the subleading singular terms can be achievedd by requiring that @xmath79 has to behave like @xmath80 as @xmath81 .",
    "given this functional form of @xmath51 near the origin of the @xmath82 plane , the boundary conditions ( [ kboundary ] ) , and the ansatz ( [ alpha2 ] ) for @xmath27 we solved equation ( [ mz1 ] ) through an iterative procedure .",
    "we start with the solution for @xmath83=0 but with full anisotropy , which can be obtained relatively easily from the ordinary differential equation ( [ mz2 ] ) .",
    "we then use this solution as input to obtain the solution for @xmath84 equal to a small number @xmath85 through the newton - raphson method @xcite . the solution for @xmath85",
    "is then used as input to obtain the solution for @xmath86 and so on .",
    "this procedure is repeated until one reaches the desired value of @xmath83 .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that one can make @xmath85 arbritrarily small to make the newton - raphson method converge . in this way we obtained solutions for different values of the ansatz parameter b for each value of @xmath83 .",
    "our solutions of equations([mz1 ] ) and along with the ansatz ( [ alpha2 ] ) give us the value of the pseudospin vector @xmath14 as a function of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , or equivalently , the value of the vector - field @xmath14 on a lattice of points on the parent x - y plane .",
    "we repeated this calculation for a set of values of the paramenter b in the ansatz ( [ alpha2 ] ) .",
    "we found that as one varies b starting from 0 , the energy does not vary much as b goes 0 to 0.1 , but then it increases sharply after b=0.1 .",
    "this behaviour is seen to be common to all @xmath83 and all @xmath87 .",
    "hence we take b to equal 0.1 . and solve the pde for a variety of values of layer separation _ d _ , and bimeron separation _ a _",
    "( _ a _ is actually half of the meron - antimeron separation ) .",
    "together all these solutions represnt a large body of calculated data .",
    "but it is neither feasible nor very interesting to try to display it all in this paper .",
    "instead we will try to bring out salient features of our solutions through examples .",
    "recall from ( [ mz2])that in the absence of the capacitance term @xmath12 had no @xmath34 - dependence . to give some feel for how the @xmath12 varies with @xmath34 in the presence of the capacitance term , we plot in fig .",
    "2 the solution @xmath88 of equation ( [ mz1 ] ) for a set of values for @xmath34 .",
    "this solution corresponds to @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the sequence of curves shown correspond to @xmath34 equal to 0 , 0.2@xmath91 , 0.47@xmath91 , and 0.94@xmath91 respectively with the outermost one belonging to @xmath34 equal to 0 .",
    "as we have discussed earlier , as @xmath33 and @xmath34 tend to zero , the solution should damp exponentially as @xmath92 .",
    "correspondingly we see in fig.2 that the low @xmath34 curves rise very slowly as @xmath33 increases away from zero .",
    "we also give for comparison , in the form of the dotted curve , the function tanh ( @xmath33 ) which is the solution in the nlsm limit .",
    "the comparison shows that the restructuring of the pseudospin texture due to the capacitance and term and anisotropy is considerable .    as an alternate representation of our results",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "3 the projection of @xmath14 on the x - y plane , for the example of @xmath30 equal to 0.7 and @xmath83 equal to 4.4 .",
    "( all lengths throughout this article are in units of the magnetic length @xmath93 ) .",
    "the length of each arrow gives the magnitude of its easy - plane projection @xmath94 and its direction gives the azimuthal angle of the projected vector , namely , @xmath95 .",
    "the plot clearly shows that our `` bimeron '' solution is indeed a meron - antimeron pair .",
    "note that , as desired , @xmath96 lies along the x - axis asymptotically .",
    "this picture closely resembles the general structure obtained by brey _ et.al .",
    "the data corresponding to all other values of @xmath30 and @xmath87 we studied have a similar behavior .",
    "in fig.4 we plot the topological charge density given in eq.([topo ] ) as a function of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the presence of all the local terms in the field equations , including anisotropic ones . in viewing this figure it may be helpful to remember that large @xmath97 corresponds to the meron centers while @xmath98 corresponds to spatial infinity .",
    "@xmath99 corresponds to the line joining the two merons.as topological charge density is symmetric when either of the co - ordinate variable changes sign we show the contours only in the first quadrant where both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are positive .",
    "next let us turn to the energetics of these bimeron solutions . in fig.5 .",
    "we show how the `` local '' energy i.e. the contribution from the local terms in the energy functional ( all terms in eq([eff ] ) except for @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) varies when one changes the separation @xmath100 between the meron and antimeron centres .",
    "the appearance of a minimum is quite conspiquous and generic to all the layer separations for which the energy is calculated .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "5 corresponds to a layer separation of 0.7 .    in fig.6",
    "we plot the coulomb energy @xmath101 evaluated using our solution of the equation ( [ mz1 ] ) , as a function of the bimeron separation .",
    "the continuous curve is the best fit to our calculated points . sometimes in the literature , a phenomenological estimate of bimeron energetics",
    "is made assuming that it can be viewed as a bound pair of two merons , each symmetrical , undistorted by the other and carrying a charge of @xmath102 .",
    "such a pair would have a coulomb energy of @xmath103 ( in units of @xmath104 that we are using ) . to see how good an approximation this simple picture is , we give in the same fig.6 , in the form of a broken line the plot of this function @xmath103 .",
    "we see that the value of the coulomb energy we get from the actual bimeron solution is much larger than what the simple two - charge picture would give .",
    "this is presumably because each meron is considerably squashed ( polarised ) by the close proximity of the other . in our earlier work on single merons @xcite",
    ", we had found that at the layer separation ( @xmath105 ) used in fig.6 , the core - radius of individual merons is about 2 , which is of the same order as the meron - separation in fig 6 .",
    "in fact we can see that the gap between the two curves in fig.6 is higher for smaller @xmath87 where the individual merons are squeezed together more .",
    "of course our results , while indicative , may not be quantitatively unambiguous .",
    "for instance , recall that our solution was obtained using only the local terms in the differential equation and the coulomb energy was calculated by substituting this solution into the integral @xmath24 .",
    "the non - local coulomb term s influence @xmath106 the solution has no been included .",
    "in fig.7 we plot the variation of three terms in the energy fuctional namely the contribution from the local terms ( capacitance+gradient energy ) , @xmath101 and @xmath107 as a function of the bimeron separation.the data presented here corresponds to layer separation @xmath30 equal to 0.7@xmath108 but this behaviour is representative of almost all the layer separations ( 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 and 0.8 for which we have found solutions .",
    "the trend of all three contributions is the same for the other layer separations also with only slight changes in the slope of the curves .",
    "our calculations were done for different bimeron separations @xmath87 , for each layer separation @xmath30 .",
    "in reality , the exact solution should exist only for some optimal bimeron separation @xmath87 for each value of @xmath30 .",
    "one can ask if our calculations would reveal this by minimising the total energy at some particular @xmath87 . to see this ,",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "8 the total energy at d=0.7 ( i.e. the sum of all three contributions plotted in the fig.7 ) as a function of bimeron separation @xmath87 .",
    "as we can see from fig.7 , the total energy keeps decreasing with @xmath87 , all the way to about @xmath109 , which is the highest value upto which we could calculate , given limitations of our computing facilties .",
    "however , the decrease is clearly levelling off and is indicative that a minimum may exist at around a=4 or 5 .",
    "what we have done , in drawing fig.8 , is to obtain a best - fit - curve of the data points upto a=3.2 and extrapolate that curve upto a=4.5 . for what it is worth",
    "such extrapolation indicates a minimum at about a=4 .",
    "this corresponds to a meron - antimeron separation of of about 8 , larger than what yang and macdonald found by entirely different methods ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) @xcite .",
    "their value of the meron separation for @xmath105 is about 4.5 .",
    "we attribute this discrepency to the fact , noted already in our discussion of fig.6 , that the coulomb energy in our explicit calculation of the bimeron solution is higher than the undistorted meron pair estimate used in ref(@xcite ) .",
    "the actual larger coulomb repulsion is , we believe responsible for the larger optimal meron separation that we get .",
    "we saw that the coulomb interaction energy between the two merons as given by the term @xmath24 in the present calculation differs quite a bit from the simple picture of the bimeron as a pair of undistorted merons of charge @xmath110 each .",
    "one can ask if there is a similar discrepency in the non - coulombic energy as well . this is the subject of table 1 . in the picture of a bimeron as a pair of merons @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ", it will have energy equal to e_prev  2e_mc +  2_e  ln ( ) where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are respectively the core energy and radius of a single merons , which have a logarithmic interaction with each other because of the logarithmic divergence of the self energy of single merons .",
    "( as stated already we are leaving out their coulomb interaction in the comparison being done in this table . )",
    "this @xmath113 has been calculated in our previous work @xcite .",
    "it can be compared with the local part of the energy in the present calculation .",
    "such a comparison is given in table 1 for different values of @xmath30 , using the optimal value of the meron separation @xmath87 which minimises @xmath114 .",
    "we see that the comparison is not bad considering the completely different ways of estimating this energy in this paper and in earlier literature .    in conclusion ,",
    "our solution for the bimeron obtained by directly solving the coupled partial differential equations that the bimeron texture obeys provides an alternate way of obtaining the profiles and energies of these objects .",
    "as far as the local part of the energy is concerned , the results are in broad agremment with microscopic derivations earlier . but the coulomb energy we obtain is higher by a factor of about 2 from earlier simple estimates because in actuality , the two merons in close proximity will not behave like undistorted symmetrical merons .",
