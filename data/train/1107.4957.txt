    "spin - imbalanced ultracold @xmath0li atoms confined to different geometries are spin-1/2 fermion systems displaying the interplay of cooper pairing and spin - polarization and have been the subject of several recent studies.@xcite confinement to nearly one - dimensional tubes can be achieved if the ultracold cloud of atoms is subjected to a two - dimensional optical lattice , which defines a two - dimensional array of tubes.@xcite the tubes can be regarded as isolated if the confinement by the laser beams is strong enough to suppress tunneling between tubes .",
    "the scattering between atoms under transverse harmonic confinement is subject to a confinement - induced resonance.@xcite fine - tuning this feshbach - type resonance , the interaction between the fermions can be made attractive and its strength can be varied.@xcite the interaction is local and can be approximated by a @xmath8-function potential in space . the confinement along the tube is roughly harmonic and weak ; it can be locally incorporated into the chemical potential .",

    "the procedure is completely analogous to that used for magnetic impurities ( degenerate anderson model in the @xmath59 limit with zeeman and crystalline field splittings).@xcite    the phase diagram for @xmath128 and @xmath129 is shown in figs . 4 and 5 , respectively . for these parameters",
    "the level crossings are at @xmath103 and @xmath102 .",
    "the level crossings stabilize the i+iii+iv and i+ii+iv ( ii+iii+iv ) mixed phases over the i+ii+iii+iv mixed phase .",
    "as discussed above , the phase i+iii+iv for @xmath130 involves different condensates than for @xmath131 .",
    "all phase boundaries are the consequence of one of the four rapidity bands getting empty and , hence , a transition involves a one - dimensional van hove singularity with the corresponding consequences on the density of states and low-@xmath9 specific heat . for small magnetic fields",
    "the phase is a mixture of two - particle and four - particle bound states . for larger fields",
    "@xmath6 , the four - particle bound states are only favorable if the density of particles is high enough . also for intermediate magnetic fields",
    "the phase diagram for @xmath132 is very different from that of @xmath133 .",
    "we studied an ultracold gas of fermionic atoms with an attractive contact potential by solving the corresponding bethe _ ansatz _ equations .",
    "we obtained the phase diagram for a @xmath7 in a magnetic field ( @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 ) within the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "four elementary states can occur : ( i ) polarized unbound atoms with spin - component @xmath134 , ( ii ) bound pairs of atoms with spin - components @xmath134 and @xmath135 , ( iii ) bound states of three particles with spin - components @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , and ( iv ) bound states of four particles , one with each spin - component .",
    "mixed phases of different classes of bound states dominate the phase diagram . for a given chemical potential the phases are homogeneous and display no long - range order .",
    "the transitions between phases are crossovers of the prokovskii - talapov type .",
    "there are several advantages of working in the grand - canonical ensemble vs. the canonical ensemble,@xcite where the number of particles is kept fixed .",
    "( 1 ) by rescaling all quantities in the integral equations for the dressed energy potentials , @xmath137 , with the interaction strength @xmath89 , one obtains _ universal _",
    "equations for the phase diagram @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 .",
    "our phase diagram shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 is then valid for all attractive @xmath89 .",
    "this is not the case if the total number of particles is kept fixed .",
    "( 2 ) since the diameter of the tube gradually changes with position from the center of the trap to its boundaries , the effective local chemical potential varies along the tube . within the local density approximation",
    "this change can be represented by a harmonic potential and as a consequence of the @xmath91-dependence of @xmath5 there is an inherent tendency of phase separation,@xcite i.e. the trap is inhomogeneous . at different positions of the trap",
    "then different phases may be realized and a sequence of transitions should be observed along the trap .",
    "( 3 ) josephson tunneling between tubes and interactions between particles in different tubes,@xcite may give rise to a dimensional crossover from one - dimension to a higher dimension .",
    "this gives rise to long - range order of quantities that are generalizations of cooper pairs for @xmath67 to higher spin .",
    "the system remains strongly anisotropic and pure ( there are almost no impurities ) and is hence favorable for inhomogeneities like modulations of the order parameter of the fflo type in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "all these properties can only be studied within the framework of the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "we also investigated the theoretically interesting situation of a quadrupolar splitting superimposed with the zeeman field . in this case , the spin energy levels display two crossovers as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "hence , the character of the bound states before and after the crossover changes . in general bound states of four particles are not favorable for low particle density or high magnetic fields .",
    "the phase diagram for larger spin values can be obtained the same way but the calculations and the results are considerably more involved and complicated .",
    "an extension to hard - core bosons ( particles with integer spin ) is also possible,@xcite since the bethe _ ansatz _ equations for hard - core bosons are the same ones as for fermions .",
    "note that wave functions for hard - core bosons have a node when two particles are at the same position , in analogy to what is required by pauli s principle for fermions .",
