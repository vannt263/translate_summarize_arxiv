    "the study of the casimir effect in light front dynamics has been investigated by several authors @xcite . in the context of the non - massive scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions and imposing a periodic boundary condition on the longitudinal light front coordinate , and at fixed light front times , the traditional methods of regularization fail in extracting the finite part of the vacuum energy density @xcite .",
    "these problematic situations can be avoided if , even for the quantization taken on equal light front times , the periodic boundary condition is taken on equal minkowski times @xcite .",
    "this prescription of boundary conditions on equal usual times consistently leads , in the light front formalism , to the usual casimir energy density found in literature @xcite .    the problem of light front quantization with simultaneous presence of a thermal bath and boundary conditions was investigated in refs .",
    "specifically , the authors in @xcite considered oblique light front coordinates and periodic boundary condition on the longitudinal light front coordinate , and at fixed light front times , and obtained that , beyond the absence of regularization and break of the isotropy , the imposition of periodic boundary conditions on @xmath1 hyperplanes breaks the temperature inversion symmetry .    in the present paper , we extend the investigation started in ref .",

    "this new system of coordinates @xmath3 is related to the minkowski coordinates @xmath4 through a linear transformation @xmath5 where @xmath6    we then consider the massless scalar field in the oblique lf coordinate system , given by the lagrangian density @xmath7 the field decomposition takes the form @xcite @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 and @xmath10 finally , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , satisfying @xmath13 = 2 \\bar{k}_3 \\delta^3(\\bar{k}- \\bar{q}).\\ ] ]    next , we calculate the helmholtz free energy and casimir entropy , as functions of the temperature , for a periodic boundary condition taken at fixed minkowski times , @xmath14    we then follow @xcite ( and references therein ) and write the helmholtz free energy @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the vacuum energy density , given by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the hamiltonian ) , and @xmath20 is the explicit finite temperature contribution , @xmath21 furthermore , @xmath22 is the energy of the statistical system . considering first the boundary condition ( [ fixed - equal - times - bc ] )",
    ", we find the following constraint for the momenta : @xmath23 and applying it in the helmholtz free energy we then write @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the area associated with the transversal directions . now , considering that the distribution function @xmath26 acts as a natural regulator making all thermal results ultraviolet finite , we can change the variables @xmath27 such that the range of @xmath28 is @xmath29 , and rewrite the free helmholtz energy as : @xmath30 where in the intermediate steps we integrated over @xmath28 .",
    "we also defined the discretized energy @xmath31 as @xmath32 the calculation now is straightforward and , without going into technical details , one can find that the finite temperature contribution to the helmholtz free energy , when the boundary condition ( [ fixed - equal - times - bc ] ) is considered , is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the volume enclosed by the boundary condition , @xmath35 stands for the riemann zeta function and @xmath36 is a dimensionless variable .",
    "the first term is the free field configuration and after subtracting it we are left with the casimir free energy , given by @xmath37 before calculating the entropy of the system , it is worth noting that @xmath38 , given by eq.([correct - free - energy ] ) satisfies the tis , expressed as @xcite@xmath39 where @xmath40 is dimensionless function defined as @xmath41 this result has to be contrasted with that found for the casimir free energy at fixed light front times , @xmath42 given by @xmath43 which does not respect tis ( in fact , this behavior was already pointed out in ref.@xcite , where the high and low temperature limits of the free energy where evaluated ) .    to obtain the casimir entropy",
    ", we use the definition : @xmath44    thus , the casimir entropy for the boundary condition ( [ fixed - equal - times - bc ] ) is calculated using the free energy ( [ correct - free - energy ] ) and is written as @xmath45 on the other hand , to obtain the casimir entropy for the boundary condition ( [ fixed - lf - times - bc ] ) , we use the free energy given in eq.([eq.31 ] ) and find @xmath46 ^ 2}\\right).\\ ] ]    the behavior of the casimir entropy as a function of @xmath47 is shown in fig.([graph - entr ] ) , for eqs.([eq.30 ] ) and ( [ eq.40 ] ) .     as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the full line corresponds to boundary condition ( [ fixed - equal - times - bc ] ) ; the dashed line to boundary condition ( [ fixed - lf - times - bc ] ) ; and the dotted line to @xmath48 . ]    in particular , in the classical limit ( i.e. for high temperatures , wherein the energy equipartition theorem is valid @xcite ) , @xmath49 , the casimir entropy at fixed light front times @xmath50 , eq.([eq.40 ] ) , decreases linearly with the temperature , @xmath51 not having the expected thermodynamical behavior in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the eq.([eq.30 ] ) , considered at fixed minkowski times , where the entropy behaves in the expected way , increasing monotonically as the temperature increases , up to a critical value .",
    "after this value ( high temperature limit ) , it becomes independent of the temperature , @xmath52 being exactly the known classical entropy per volume unit @xcite .",
    "in addition to the analysis of the entropy , we also examine the casimir energy in the classical limit for the two boundary conditions given by ( [ fixed - lf - times - bc ] ) and ( [ fixed - equal - times - bc ] ) .",
    "the casimir energy at finite temperature is defined as a sum of the zero - point energy and the casimir energy of the quantum system referring to real occupied states : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the regularized vacuum energy density and @xmath55 is the explicit temperature - dependent contribution to the casimir energy density , which is obtained from difference between the energy density of the field in the presence of external constraints and the one of the free field , i.e. , @xmath56 furthermore , in the ref.@xcite the authors noted that @xmath55 , in the high temperature limit , contains exactly the zero - temperature casimir energy with opposite sign , @xmath57 leading to a vanishing total casimir energy , @xmath58 where higher order terms vanish exponentially fast .",
    "this result is also known as the kirchhoff theorem @xcite and can also be understood as been a consequence of the one - to - one correspondence @xcite together with the classical energy equipartition theorem .",
    "now , if we consider the boundary condition ( [ fixed - equal - times - bc ] ) the energy @xmath59 can be calculated from @xmath20 through @xmath60 and matches exactly the instant form calculation @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the high temperature limit is given by @xmath61 it is worth emphasizing that the temperature independent term appearing in this expression is exactly the zero - temperature casimir energy with opposite sign @xcite .",
    "the free field configuration is obtained replacing the summation in eq.([free - ener - beta ] ) by an integration over all momenta @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "therefore , one obtains the energy of the free field configuration as @xmath63 collecting all the results we find @xmath64 respecting the kirchhoff theorem .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the boundary condition ( [ fixed - lf - times - bc ] ) and follow the same steps , the high temperature limit of @xmath59 is obtained to be @xmath65 assuming that this expression contains exactly the zero - temperature casimir energy with opposite sign , we identify the temperature - independent term with the casimir energy at zero temperature , namely @xmath66    the free field configuration is given by @xmath67 a straightforward calculation gives the result @xmath68 collecting all the results we find @xmath69 which clearly does not respect the kirchhoff theorem .",
    "for completeness , in this section we present the analysis of the problem considering the dirac light front coordinates .",
    "these coordinates were first proposed by dirac , and are given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 are the minkowski coordinates and we have used the notation @xmath72 .",

    "in contrast , once a light - front description of a theory is manifestly relativistic , we consider an alternative velocity for the heat bath , given by @xmath83 in which case , the density matrix is written as @xmath84 using this prescription , the explicit finite temperature contribution to the helmholtz free energy becomes @xmath85 \\delta\\left(\\frac{k_i^2}{4k_{- } } - \\frac{2\\pi n}{l}\\right).\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then change the variables , @xmath86 such that the range of @xmath28 is @xmath87 and rewrite the free helmholtz energy as : @xmath88 recovering eq.([eq10 ] ) , which reproduces the correct behavior for the free energy and entropy .",
