    "coisotropic submanifolds of symplectic manifolds are a natural generalization of lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "they may equally well be defined on poisson manifolds , and in that context , as known since [ we2 ] , they play precisely the same general role as lagrangian submanifolds do in the symplectic category : a smooth map @xmath5 between two poisson manifolds is a poisson map if and only if its graph is coisotropic in @xmath6 .",
    "staying in the symplectic category , a coisotropic is defined as a submanifold @xmath7 which contains its symplectic orthogonal : @xmath8 this distribution @xmath9 on @xmath7 is of constant rank as @xmath10 is non - degenerate , and is integrable as @xmath10 is closed .",
    "thus a coisotropic has a canonical foliation , the _",
    "null foliation _ , which we denote @xmath11 . in the lagrangian case it reduces to the trivial foliation by one leaf , and at the other extreme , the symplectic manifold is coisotropic in itself with codimension zero , so",
    "the null foliation is the trivial foliation by points . in the general case",
    ", we have some mixture of tangential and transverse structure , a foliation whose leaf space is a symplectic space .    the deformation problem of coisotropics in the symplectic category was taken up in 2003 by oh and park ( [ op ] ) as a natural boundary condition in the a - model , after kapustin and orlov gave evidence that some special coisotropics must be included in the fukaya category for the homological mirror symmetry conjecture to hold ( [ ko ] ) . in the same year , cattaneo and felder pursued their quantization in poisson manifolds as natural boundary conditions for the poisson sigma model ( [ cf ] ) .",
    "the main result of [ op ] , to be elaborated in part 1 , is :    ( [ op ] ) there exists the structure of an @xmath0-algebra on @xmath12({\\mathcal{f}})$ ] , the shifted foliation complex of the null foliation .",
    "furthermore , the first - order operator @xmath13 of this structure is the natural differential @xmath2 on this complex , and the maurer - cartan equation of this @xmath0-algebra is the defining equation for a small deformation of @xmath7 ( the zero section ) to be coisotropic .",
    "there is a natural obstruction theory for any @xmath0-algebra , determining if an infinitesimal deformation may be extended to a full deformation , and thus identifying if the moduli space is singular at a particular point . here",
    "an infinitesimal deformation @xmath14 is one for which @xmath15 , and proving that an obstruction class is exact amounts to inverting @xmath2 .",
    "this may be a very badly behaved differential operator , and the associated foliation cohomology is generally infinite - dimensional .",
    "the obstruction classes of an @xmath0-algebra are in terms of @xmath16 and the higher - order operators . in our coisotropic case",
    ", @xmath16 represents the transverse symplectic form .",
    "if the foliation has finite holonomy , then the leaf space is a symplectic orbifold , and we may work with the obstruction class directly on the leaf space .",
    "it remains to identify a good model for the leaf space in the case of infinite holonomy .",
    "a prototypical example is the following : consider a foliation having transverse section a disk , and holonomy given by rotation of the disk by a fixed angle @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath17 irrational , the naive definition of the leaf space suffers a loss of dimension , and so can not adequately represent the transverse bracket .    in [ hae ]",
    ", haefliger offered the group @xmath4 as a model for the leaf space of a foliation .",
    "it is defined in terms of @xmath18 a transverse section of the foliation , making no connectedness assumption . here",
    "@xmath18 plays the role of an open cover for the leaf space , with forms on two neighborhoods being identified via pullback along the leaves .",
    "this gives a subtler notion than the naive quotient obtained by using forms constant along leaves .",
    "further relevance to our obstruction question is bestowed by haefliger s integration - over - leaves map @xmath19 , which maps forms on the total space to forms in haefliger s group .",
    "appropriately restricted , this gives a map from foliation cohomology to haefliger s group .",
    "we will consider an example based on the disk rotation described above , a 4-manifold @xmath20 , @xmath21 , viewed as a coisotropic .",
    "with the help of haefliger s map , we find that the behavior of the deformation problem depends not only on if @xmath17 is irrational , but in fact on what kind of irrational number it is :    the deformation problem of the 4-manifold @xmath22 , as a coisotropic , is obstructed in the two cases    * @xmath23 , and * @xmath24 a liouville number ,    and unobstructed in the case    * @xmath24 satisfying a diophantine condition .    furthermore ,",
    "as haefliger s group already distinguishes the three cases , we view this as deforming some structure over the leaf space , with haefliger s group as model .",
    "we then interpret the result by saying that the deformation problem of the leaf space behaves like the orbifold case ( @xmath23 ) , exactly when it is `` close to '' being an orbifold .",
    "i would like to thank prof .",
    "joel robbin for many helpful discussions , and especially my advisor , prof .",
    "yong - geun oh , for his generous support during my time in wisconsin , and for suggesting a question which led to more questions , which led to more questions ...",
    "we follow the conventions of [ dmz ] in our definition of @xmath0-algebras , in particular with respect to signs .",
    "let @xmath25 be a @xmath26-graded vector space , with @xmath27 homogeneous elements of degree @xmath28 .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the tensor algebra of @xmath25 , and by @xmath30 the quotient of @xmath29 by the ideal generated by all elements of the form @xmath31 .",
    "then we define the koszul sign :    for @xmath32 any permutation of @xmath33 , the * koszul sign * @xmath34 is determined by @xmath35    note that @xmath36 refers to the action of @xmath32 on @xmath29 , as it depends on the degrees @xmath28 : it counts the number of interchanges of odd elements .",
    "we denote the * antisymmetric koszul sign * @xmath37 as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 refers to the standard sign of @xmath32 as a permutation of @xmath33 .",
    "we call an operator @xmath40 _ graded commutative _ if it is well - defined on @xmath30 , that is , if @xmath41 we call an operator @xmath42 _ graded anti - commutative _ if the same identity holds with @xmath43 in place of @xmath44 .",
    "if we consider a lie algebra as a graded vector space with every element in degree 0 , the lie bracket is graded anti - commutative .",
    "if we consider every element to be in degree 1 , the bracket is graded commutative .",
    "now for the definition of @xmath0-algebra , we wish to form the composition of two graded anti - commutative operators .",
    "given two graded anti - commutative operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we define the graded anti - commutative operator @xmath47 , by @xmath48 here @xmath49 denotes the subgroup of @xmath50 consisting of all unshuffles of @xmath51 elements into two ordered sets of @xmath52 elements and @xmath53 elements , respectively .",
    "finally we are ready to define    an * @xmath0-algebra * is @xmath25 , a @xmath26-graded vector space , together with a sequence of graded anti - commutative operators @xmath54 of degree 2-k , such that @xmath55    standard terminology designates as _ weak _ an @xmath0-algebra in which @xmath56 .",
    "the condition @xmath57 is also referred to as _ flatness_. as noted in [ op ] , the @xmath0-algebra governing the deformation of coisotropics is flat , and we assume flatness for the remainder of the present work .",
    "some light is shed on flatness in the poisson context by the approach of voronov via higher derived brackets ( [ vo ] ) .",
    "cattaneo and felder , in [ cf ] , show that the @xmath0-structure produced for any submanifold of a poisson manifold is flat if and only if the submanifold is coisotropic . for a further study of higher homotopy structures and their application to the deformation of coisotropics , see [ sch ] .    for a flat @xmath0-algebra ,",
    "the first coherence relations take the form @xmath58 thus the first relation allows us to define a cohomology theory , and the second encodes the leibniz rule for @xmath13 and @xmath16 , almost yielding a differential graded lie algebra ( dgla ) .",
    "the third relation measures the failure of the jacobi identity @xmath59 , a phenomenon we will return to in our coisotropic case below .",
    "for @xmath60 an @xmath0-algebra and @xmath61 , the _ maurer - cartan equation _",
    "( mc ) is @xmath62 which reduces to the traditional case @xmath63 if @xmath64 .",
    "an @xmath0-algebra is said to _ govern _ a deformation problem if deformations preserving the structure under consideration are exactly those satisfying the mc equation of the given @xmath0-algebra .    to study deformations using this apparatus , we attempt to find power series solutions to the mc equation near zero . that is , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a formal parameter , and each @xmath67 is an element of the underlying vector space @xmath25 . for our purposes",
    "it suffices to consider degree 1 elements ( shifted degree 0 ) , incidentally simplifying signs considerably .",
    "we require @xmath68 to solve the mc equation for each @xmath66 , and after gathering terms by degree , we find : @xmath69    we call @xmath70 satisfying @xmath71 an _ infinitesimal deformation_. from the @xmath0-relations , it follows that @xmath72 .",
    "then the second equation above says that the @xmath13-cohomology class @xmath73 $ ] vanishes , if and only if there exists @xmath74 extending @xmath14 to second order . in general",
    ", for any @xmath75 , given @xmath76 satisfying these equations up to order @xmath77 , the right hand side of equation @xmath75 defines a cohomology class , the @xmath78 obstruction class , which vanishes iff @xmath14 extends to order @xmath75 .",
    "the first obstruction class @xmath79 $ ] , sometimes referred to as the value of the _ kuranishi map _",
    "\\mapsto [ \\{{\\gamma}_1,{\\gamma}_1\\}]$ ] , suffices to prove our obstructedness results .",
    "we return to the higher obstructions in the final unobstructedness section .      as @xmath13",
    "( hereafter referred to as @xmath81 ) and @xmath16 satisfy the leibniz rule , @xmath16 induces an operation on @xmath13-cohomology .",
    "in addition , if @xmath82 are closed for @xmath83 , @xmath84 for some @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath16 in fact defines an honest lie bracket on @xmath13-cohomology , and @xmath86)$ ] gives a dgla .    on the other hand , rewriting the above , we see @xmath87 does not necessarily descend to cohomology , much less as zero : @xmath88 ( @xmath87 of three closed forms is not necessarily closed )",
    ". therefore the question remains of what relationship there is between the original @xmath0-algebra , and the induced @xmath0 ( dgla ) structure on its @xmath13-cohomology .",
    "while we do not answer this question in the present work , we hope to shed some light on its meaning for coisotropics .",
    "in this section we give a tensor - level introduction to oh and park s @xmath0-structure , as identified in [ op ] . recall :    let @xmath89 be a symplectic manifold .",
    "a submanifold @xmath90 is called * coisotropic * iff @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the symplectic orthogonal .    the assumption of closedness of @xmath10 passes to @xmath7 .",
    "thus @xmath93 generates a differential ideal in @xmath94 , which is equivalent to integrability of @xmath95 by the frobenius theorem .",
    "we call this , the foliation @xmath11 of @xmath7 such that @xmath96 , the _ null foliation _ of @xmath97",
    ".    there is also what remains of the symplectic form , `` on the quotient @xmath98 . ''",
    "to be more precise , there is a non - degenerate form on @xmath99 , which in the case of @xmath11 given by a fiber bundle , may be interpreted as a symplectic form on the base .",
    "the derham differential does not canonically restrict to @xmath100 , however , and in general we only have a non - degenerate form , not necessarily closed .",
    "( on the other hand , it would be a misnomer to call it an _ almost symplectic structure _",
    ", for the failure of closedness is not a defect of the form itself , but rather of the underlying space in its failure to be a manifold . )",
    "thus there are two aspects to the structure of a coisotropic , the null foliation and the transverse structure , and both present obstacles when considering deformations .",
    "the deformation of foliations is quite general and involved , and while the deformation of ( compact ) symplectic manifolds is unobstructed , we rapidly encounter leaf spaces which are not manifolds .",
    "it would represent a beginning toward both problems to identify a fine model for the leaf space .",
    "one model for the leaf space of a foliation is the _ basic _ forms .",
    "let @xmath101 be a smooth , foliated manifold .",
    "a differential form @xmath102 is called * basic * if , for all @xmath103 , @xmath104 in particular , a function @xmath105 is basic if for all @xmath103 , @xmath106 .",
    "proposition 5.2 of [ op ] states holonomy - invariance of @xmath93 , which , combined with closedness , implies it is basic . in our example",
    ", the basic cohomology will be rather easy to describe , but carries very little information .",
    "another tool , which keeps track of essentially the opposite information , is the _ foliation cohomology _ @xmath3 , defined from the cochain complex @xmath107 , which we describe in the next section .",
    "the principal problem with this complex is that unlike basic forms , it does not canonically include in @xmath94 .",
    "there is a spectral sequence decomposing @xmath94 ( [ to ] ) , and given an inclusion @xmath108 , the foliation cohomology @xmath109 appears in the first column at the @xmath110 level , the complex of basic forms @xmath111 in the first row .",
    "hence @xmath112 , and all of @xmath3 is a module over basic functions .",
    "even basic cohomology may already be infinite - dimensional ( [ gh ] ) , so at first glance foliation cohomology is a rather poorly behaved object .",
    "what will concern us is exactly the part of @xmath3 that goes beyond @xmath113 .",
    "finally , for completeness we mention two facts .",
    "one is that were we to restrict attention to transversely holomorphic foliations , there is a versality theorem for transversely symplectic foliations that would apply , due to girbau and guasp ( [ gg ] ) .",
    "the other is that there is a ech - derham theory for foliations , defined by crainic and moerdijk ( [ cm ] ) , which subsumes the above cohomologies and has better properties . among other things",
    ", it satisfies poincar duality .",
    "there is a natural map to foliation cohomology with compact supports , and in general some information is lost . the foliation ech - derham theory , however , is difficult to compute with .      in the lagrangian embedding theorem",
    "( [ we1 ] ) , a tubular neighborhood of a lagrangian submanifold @xmath115 of a symplectic manifold is canonically identified with the cotangent bundle of @xmath115 with the standard symplectic form .",
    "furthermore , ( @xmath116-small ) sections are lagrangian if and only if they are closed as 1-forms .",
    "thus the deformation problem of lagrangian submanifolds is unobstructed , in fact linear . after identifying trivial deformations with exact forms , we find it has a finite - dimensional moduli space , modelled on @xmath117",
    ".    correspondingly , by a coisotropic embedding theorem of gotay [ go ] , the normal bundle of @xmath7 in @xmath118 is modelled ( non - canonically ) by the cotangent bundle @xmath119 of the null foliation . from this one constructs the foliation derham complex @xmath120 , which hosts a canonical differential @xmath2 for any foliation @xmath11 .",
    "this differential is defined by the cartan formula , which makes sense due to involutivity of @xmath121 :    let @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "then @xmath124,x_0 , ...",
    "\\hat{x_i } , ...",
    "\\hat{x_j } , ...",
    "x_k ) . \\end{array}\\ ] ]    thus @xmath125 may be viewed alternatively as lie algebra cohomology of the foliation , lie algebroid cohomology of the tangent bundle of the foliation , and the restriction of derham cohomology to the foliation .",
    "( for further discussion of foliated cohomology and references , see [ cm ] , [ ds ] , [ va ] . )",
    "the first way in which the coisotropic case differs from the lagrangian case is that this cohomology is generally infinite dimensional .",
    "there is a symplectic form on @xmath119 as well ( [ go ] ) , again non - canonical , which allows us to ask when the graph of a small section is coisotropic .",
    "coisotropic deformations also differ from lagrangians in that they are not described entirely by @xmath2 . rather , the defining equation is non - linear to all orders , given by the maurer - cartan equation of an @xmath0-algebra .",
    "the higher - order operators of the @xmath0-algebra include the transverse symplectic structure , and additionally , the defect in the symplectic reduction as a smooth manifold .",
    "the first - order operator @xmath13 of this @xmath0-structure is given by @xmath126 .",
    "we now proceed to define @xmath16 .",
    "to define higher - order operators on @xmath127 , we note that @xmath10 induces a well - defined non - degenerate form on @xmath99 .",
    "it is not possible to speak of closedness of this form , however , as the bundle @xmath100 itself , while a subbundle of @xmath128 , is not closed under @xmath129 .",
    "in fact we consider the poisson bivector dual to the symplectic form on @xmath119 .",
    "the non - degenerate form on @xmath130 also has a dual @xmath131 , not necessarily satisfying the jacobi identity . to write @xmath132 in coordinates",
    ", we must choose a representative for the normal bundle .",
    "that is , we choose @xmath133 a subbundle of @xmath134 such that @xmath135 , @xmath136 otherwise known as an * ehresmann connection * for the foliation . for any choice of local foliation coordinates @xmath137 , i.e. local coordinates on @xmath7 such that @xmath11 is defined by @xmath138 , we write @xmath139 , where @xmath140 ( it is equivalent to make an arbitrary choice of @xmath141 , where @xmath142 . )",
    "then we may write @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "such a choice also allows us to make sense of taking transverse derivatives . a lengthy but straightforward derivation in section 7 of [ op ]",
    "shows that    1 .",

    ". then @xmath152 where we denote @xmath153 ( note that in [ op ] , this notation is used to signify an earlier stage . ) here @xmath2 may be seen in yet another way , as the skew - symmetrization of @xmath154 : since @xmath146 is flat in the @xmath121 direction , skew - symmetrizing @xmath154 yields a differential .",

    "what s more , it will suffice to work on an open set where @xmath146 is flat , meaning it specifies coordinates for a transverse submanifold @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath242 , while leaf topology is lost , there is another significant restriction , that of the leaves being dense in tori . in particular , this implies the zero average condition is retained . in the liouville case , this will turn out to be sufficient to retain obstructedness . in the complementary diophantine case",
    ", however , another phenomenon takes over : the holonomy also works to kill the transverse structure , making it impossible to support a non - trivial poisson bracket .",

    "we produce @xmath294 such that @xmath174 is not in the denominator of @xmath295 .",
    "for simplicity we refer to @xmath296 as @xmath297 , and begin by taking @xmath298 a smooth cutoff function vanishing smoothly on a neighborhood of both `` poles '' @xmath299 , allowing us to consider only one transverse disk .",

    "we compute @xmath174 , where in terms of the transverse coordinates @xmath305 , @xmath306 , so    @xmath307 thus we must show that @xmath308 is not of the form @xmath309 for any smooth function @xmath133 on the disk .",

    "what remains in question is if these new fourier series @xmath320 define a smooth function , and for certain @xmath17 , the so - called liouville numbers , there exist smooth functions @xmath281 for which they do not .",
    "this comes directly from replacing the term @xmath321 in the rational case with a sequence of very small numbers , and when we divide to solve for @xmath322 , we encounter the so - called small divisor problem causing the fourier coefficients to blow up .",
    "all application of this phenomenon in the present work is standard - only its context is novel .",
    "suppose we have a sequence of rational numbers @xmath323 converging to @xmath17 , for instance the @xmath324 decimal approximation to @xmath17 .",
    "we may say this example converges at the `` rate '' of @xmath325 , as @xmath326 , and the remainder term can certainly be no larger than this .",
    "it may be shown that any irrational number may in fact be approximated at the rate of @xmath327 .",
    "if we ask for convergence at the rate of @xmath328 for all @xmath329 , however , we find that not every number has such an approximation , and the set of numbers which do is of lebesgue measure zero - these are called the liouville numbers .",
    "let @xmath330 .",
    "we call @xmath331 if it has an approximation @xmath332 such that , for any @xmath333 , there exists a constant @xmath334 such that @xmath335 for all @xmath336 , or equivalently that @xmath337 for all @xmath336 .",
    "it is also equivalent to say @xmath17 is liouville if @xmath338 such that @xmath339 specifically it is not directly a question of convergence in @xmath336 .",

    "then @xmath281 is smooth , due to the liouville condition for @xmath17 .",
    "however , using the geometric fact that a chord on a circle is shorter than the arc subtended , in the form of the inequality @xmath347 we see that the coefficients @xmath348 satisfy the following : @xmath349 and so do not even give a series whose terms converge to zero .",
    "we obtain a function on the disk by multiplying @xmath350 by the cutoff function @xmath298 used in the rational case .",

    "therefore @xmath353 is not sent to zero in @xmath354 under @xmath19 , and this infinitesimal deformation is obstructed .",
    "we may understand the obstructedness result in the liouville case above as a result of the zero - average condition , brought on by dense leaves intertwining the tangent and transverse structure .",

    "we prove that in the case @xmath17 is diophantine , every infinitesimal deformation is the infinitesimal deformation of some full deformation ( i.e. the dimension of the moduli space is the same as the dimension of its tangent space ) .",

    "we define @xmath528 for @xmath529 : @xmath530 for @xmath531 , this reduces to @xmath532    we make a few remarks pertinent to our example .",
    "the contraction @xmath533 ignores any @xmath534 component of @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting endomorphism of @xmath100 is therefore @xmath535 recalling further that we may assume @xmath536 , we see that this entire expression pulls out of the double integral in the proposition , and the earlier arguments apply to the higher obstructions as well .",
    "it only remains confirm that we may solve all of these individual exactness problems simultaneously and consistently .",
    "we first point out that when @xmath133 is integrable ( @xmath537 ) , all higher @xmath0 operators vanish , yet higher obstructions do still persist , namely the following : @xmath538    we note that the main proposition does not depend on @xmath402 and @xmath165 coming from the same @xmath14 . for @xmath539 ,",
    "@xmath540 we may modify @xmath541 and @xmath542 separately to make both @xmath543 and @xmath544 constant in @xmath387 and @xmath388 , the crux of the argument .",
    "we modify all @xmath82 in this manner . by the above argument , any higher bracket ,",
    "all of whose arguments are @xmath545 with @xmath546 constant in @xmath387 and @xmath388 , is exact .",
    "in the above computations , we reduced a differential question about a foliation to an algebraic question on a complete transversal , as an tale model for the leaf space .",
    "the connection is rather tight - for instance the resolution of a singularity proved to be almost identical under the two perspectives .",
    "the transverse bracket @xmath16 in particular is well - represented by its image under haefliger s map , which , due to the isomorphism @xmath547 in this case , can be viewed as the induced bracket on @xmath13-cohomology .",
    "the transverse curvature used in the definition of the higher - order @xmath0-operators , on the other hand , was defined as a global vector - valued form , and in this example , it was simply shown to have no effect .",
    "a natural next step would be to consider an example with vanishing first obstruction , and use the curvature to twist the bracket such that higher obstructions do not vanish .",
    "then the following natural questions arise : does the curvature itself pass to an tale model for the leaf space , something of the form @xmath548 ?",
    "do the higher order @xmath0-operators descend ? and what measures the difference , if any , between this @xmath0-structure and the induced dgla structure on @xmath13-cohomology ?"
