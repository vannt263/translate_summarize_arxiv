    "a total coloring of a graph @xmath0 is a coloring of its vertices and edges such that no adjacent vertices , edges , and no incident vertices and edges obtain the same color .",

    "this conjecture became known as total coloring conjecture @xcite .",
    "it is known that total coloring conjecture holds for cycles , for complete graphs @xcite , for bipartite graphs , for complete multipartite graphs @xcite , for graphs with a small maximum degree @xcite , for graphs with minimum degree at least @xmath11 @xcite , and for planar graphs @xmath0 with @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "the general upper bound for the total chromatic number was obtained by m. molloy and b. reed @xcite , who proved that @xmath19 for every graph @xmath0 .",

    "the key concept discussed in a present paper is the following . given a graph @xmath0 ,",

    "the concept of interval total coloring @xcite is a new one in graph coloring , synthesizing interval colorings @xcite and total colorings .",
    "the introduced concept is valuable as it connects to the problems of constructing a timetable without a gapand it extends to total colorings of graphs one of the most important notions of classical mathematics - the one of continuity .    in this paper",
