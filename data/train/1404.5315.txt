    "@xcite , using the same @xmath5 _ chandra _ observation of @xcite analysis , found morphological disturbances in the x - ray emitting gas , and interpreted them as the result of interaction with the central agn . instead a subsequent analysis of deeper _ chandra _ observations by @xcite showed a generally undisturbed x - ray morphology , consistent with that expected from a hot ism in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "later , the analysis by @xcite of _ chandra _ observations shallower that those of @xcite - but deeper than @xcite - revealed ( again ) disturbances and cavities in the ism connected with the radio emission .    thanks to the relatively small distance and large supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass ( @xmath6 few @xmath7 ) of ngc 4649 , _ chandra _ resolves radii close to the bondi accretion radius , @xmath8 , at which the gravitational binding energy of a gas element becomes larger than its thermal energy @xcite .",

    "in particular , we notice that the s / n of the binned pixel in the observed structures is of the order of 3 or higher , pointing to an higher significance of the structures as a whole .    in order to evaluate the reliability of the observed structures and their dependence on the particular model used",
    ", we performed the 2-d fitting procedure described above excluding data between 5  and 70  ( so avoiding the structures shown in figure [ fig : sign10 ] ) and then subtracted the best - fit model so obtained from the complete dataset .",

    "figure [ fig : profiles ] shows temperature and gas density profiles out to a radius @xmath45 in comparison with that obtained with similar techniques by @xcite using shallower _ chandra _ data .",
    "the temperature we derive is systematically higher than that of @xcite , while our gas density is systematically lower .",

    "* ) . in particular with respect to this previous analysis",
    ", while the gas density profiles have similar shapes , we see that our temperature profile , rather than a decrease up to @xmath46 followed by a monotonic increase up to the outer regions , is characterized by a decrease up to @xmath47 followed by a  plateau \" of almost constant temperature up to @xmath20 ( the same scales of the structures shown in figure [ fig : sign10 ] ) .",
    "the two profiles are properly fitted by a double broken power - law model ( shown in figure [ fig : profiles ] with the dashed lines ) , with breaks at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "in the local universe , most central smbhs in elliptical galaxies are radiatively quiescent , and often seen in a `` radio - mode '' , where they are able to drive jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "mechanical feedback of these jets has a significant impact on the surrounding ism , with implications for galaxy and smbh coevolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "many aspects of this feedback process , though , are not well understood , including the nature of the material feeding the smbhs , the details of how accretion originates a mechanical energy output , in the form of a wind or a jet , and then how this couples to the surrounding ism heating it .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of hot gas rich elliptical galaxies often show direct evidence of mechanical feedback in the form of radio jets and inflated bubbles displacing the hot plasma . from a study of nine x - ray luminous ellipticals harboring cavities , sufficiently nearby to measure the hot gas density and temperature reasonably close to the smbh",

    "@xmath10 correlates also with the ( extended ) radio luminosity , albeit in relationships showing a large scatter @xcite .",
    "thanks to the long cumulative _ chandra _ pointing on ngc 4649 we have determined the hot gas density and temperature in a wide range of radii , discovering cavities and a ring - like higher - pressure ripple .",
    "we also determine these parameters in the nuclear region with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the residual map of the x - ray emission with respect to a standard @xmath22 model ( figure [ fig : sign10 ] ) shows significant cavities and bright spots on sub - kpc scale , as well as more extended ring like structures at scales @xmath20 .",
    "these previously unreported features appear to be morphologically related with the weak nuclear radio source @xcite .",
    "we find no significant temperature variations between under - dense and over - dense regions ( see figure [ fig : spectral_results ] ) .",
    "moreover , looking at the average temperature profile presented in figure [ fig : profiles ] ( left panel ) , we see an almost constant temperature @xmath51 in the @xmath52 range .",
    "this resembles the case of the ripples and cavities around ngc 1275 in the perseus cluster , discovered by @xcite with _ chandra _ , which also shows no sign of increased temperature in higher pressure regions .",
    "@xcite concluded that the ngc 1275 structures may be isothermal waves whose energy is dissipated by viscosity , with thermal conduction and sound waves effectively distributing the energy from the radio source .",
    "the radial kt profile of ngc 4649 shows a sudden increase up to @xmath53 in the inner @xmath54 .",
    "_ chandra _ observations revealed central temperatures higher than the surroundings in other early type galaxies with low or very low power radio sources : ngc 4594 @xcite , ngc 4552 @xcite , ngc 3115 @xcite and ngc 4278 @xcite .",
    "this hotter core has been interpreted as a result of heating from gravitational effects due to the central smbh , a recent agn outburst , or interaction with confined nuclear jets . the clear evidence for agn feedback on the large scale in ngc 4649 ( i.e.",
    ", the series of cavities , likely more numerous than the n and s ones that will be investigated in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : jet_power ] ) provides support to the idea of repeated agn heating occurring at the center , possibly producing the temperature peak , for example through shock activity .",
    "note that the radiative cooling time in the innermost radial bin is just @xmath55 yr ( using the cooling curve from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then if such cooling is to be offset a heating mechanism is required . following the calculation by @xcite",
    ", we can interpret the observed structures as isothermal waves and show that they can provide an effective way to heat the ism .",
    "in fact , the thermal pressure deviations from the average value ( shown in figure [ fig : spectral_results ] ) are about 5 - 10% ( comparable with those observed in ngc 1275 , although with less significance ) .",
    "then , such waves can balance radiative cooling if the cooling time is @xmath56 times the crossing time evaluated from the local sound speed @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this condition is met , since the cross time for the inner @xmath58 region is @xmath59 , while the cooling time at this radius turns out to be @xmath60 .",
    "so , even if constraints on isothermal waves are not as tight as in the case of ngc 1275 due to larger uncertainties , it is possible for them to be the source of the ism disturbances we observe in ngc 4649 .",
    "to further investigate the origin of the observed ism disturbances , we performed an analysis similar to that proposed by @xcite , confronting the mass profiles obtained from the hot gas profiles presented in figure [ fig : profiles ] through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and the ones obtained from independent diagnostics such as stellar kinematics , globular clusters ( gcs ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) velocities @xcite .",
    "the profiles are presented in figure [ fig : masses ] ( left panel ) , the hot gas - derived profile is in light blue and that from stellar and gc kinematics in red @xcite , with the strips width representing the relative uncertainties . in the outer regions",
    "the mass profiles from @xcite are plotted in green ( gcs ) and dark blue ( pne ) .    at larger radii",
    "we notice a significant discrepancy between the mass profile derived by @xcite using stellar @xcite and gc @xcite kinematics , and the mass profiles obtained by @xcite using pne @xcite and gc ( same dataset as @xcite ) kinematics assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "we note that @xcite report that pne are more centrally concentrated and are on more radial orbits with respect to the total gc population , while the red gc subpopulation is similar to that of both the stars and pne .",
    "these discrepancies have been discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who suggested that gc an pne may represent dynamically distinct systems .",
    "in addition , the analysis of stellar kinematics observation from the slugss survey by @xcite shows strong evidence for ngc 4649 of a fast rotating embedded disk structure , pointing to this galaxy as a candidate for a major merger remnant .",
    "finally , a recent analysis by @xcite revealed significant anisotropies in the two - dimensional distribution of gcs in ngc 4649 , in particular in red and blue gc populations , that may affect these mass profiles .",
    "however , we note that the gc anisotropies revealed by @xcite are on a bigger scale than the ism disturbances studied here .    in the inner radii , the mass profile from x - ray emitting hot gas and",
    "that from stellar and gc kinematics differ significantly between 0.5 and 3 kpc , again the same scales of the structures shown in figure [ fig : sign10 ] .",
    "in particular , the blue profile has been obtained using the equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the radius , @xmath63 is the gas temperature , @xmath64 is the gas densities , @xmath65 the proton mass and @xmath66 is the average molecular weight factor .",

    "see , e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and plotted it for n and s lobes in figure [ fig : masses ] ( right panel ) as black squares .",
    "although there are large uncertainties in these estimates , the radio jet pressure appears comparable with the thermal gas pressure at similar radii .",
    "we note that the non thermal pressure can account on average for @xmath70 of the gas pressure in the regions of significant ism disturbance , and that there is a striking correlation between peaks and dips in the two pressure trends . a simple cross - correlation test between the two profiles yields that without any lag the correlation is significant at the @xmath71 , indicating a correlation between the two profiles .",
    "this links the non - thermal pressure to the nuclear radio source and its jets .",
    "@xcite advanced several possibilities for the non - thermal pressure component observed in ngc 4649 , including gas rotation , random turbulence , magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure .",
    "our analysis strongly correlates the non - thermal pressure with the radio jet structure , and therefore we conclude that cosmic ray injection into the ism from the weak radio jets is the most likely origin of this pressure component .      to investigate the effects of the non - thermal pressure on the smbh mass estimate we fitted the mass profile derived with eq .",

    "besides the details of the dm halo ( more relevant in the outer regions ) , comparing with the mass profile form @xcite we note the main effect of the non - thermal pressure ( significant in the @xmath81 range ) on this fitting procedure is to yield higher values of @xmath73 , that is , a higher contribution of the stellar component to the total mass , and as a consequence a lower smbh mass .",
    "however , since the central smbh mass is mainly driven by the mass profile in innermost radii , its estimate does not appear to be strongly affected by the presence of the non - thermal pressure component .",

    "indeed , the stellar component of ngc 4649 is known to possess a significant rotation @xcite . if @xmath122 , the predicted @xmath114 goes down to @xmath123 erg s@xmath92 , which is now larger than @xmath124 by a factor between one hundred and six hundreds , considering the range for @xmath9 .    in conclusion , the accretion flow seems to emit less than predicted from the fuel observed to be available , even when allowing for a riaf with angular momentum at the outer radius of the accretion flow ( the various powers and luminosities considered here are summarized in table [ table : powers ] ) ; possible solutions could be that the bolometric correction is larger , so that @xmath125 becomes larger ( this is not expected to fix entirely the problem , though ) , or that the accretion flow should be modeled differently ( i.e. , with an even lower radiative efficiency ) , or that outflows / convective motions are important .",
    "we note that a very low radiation efficiency was also found in the deep @xmath126 ms _ chandra _ observations of ngc 3115 @xcite indicating for this source either a remarkably inefficient flow or a very low accretion rate suppressed by outflow , rotational support or stellar feedback .",
    "however , the total ( observed ) power output from the black hole is the sum of the radiating ( e.g. , @xmath125 ) and mechanical powers , where the latter by far dominates usually in the low luminosity nuclei of the local universe .",
    "therefore , a further important constraint on how much mass must be accreting comes from @xmath10 , and is examined below .",
    "pointed vla observations by @xcite showed the radio properties at 1.4 ghz ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and their connection with the cavities in the hot ism ( from a shallower 37 ksec _",
    "exposure ) .",
    "@xcite derived a total flux density of @xmath127 jy at 1.4 ghz ; for a distance of 16 mpc , this gives a radio power of @xmath128 erg s@xmath92 hz@xmath92 , that is @xmath129 erg s@xmath92 .",
    "thus ngc 4649 is a low - power radio source , one of the least radio emitting giant ellipticals with respect to those in the samples that produced the correlations between @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and radio luminosity mentioned above ; it is useful then to establish whether extrapolation to lower luminosity sources is applicable .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite used the 1.4 ghz image to determine the edges of the cavities , and then calculate the kinetic energy of the jet , as the sum of their internal energy and the pdv work done to inflate them ( as @xmath130 ) . since the majority of the energy carried off by these jets is mechanical , not radiative ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , the resulting energy @xmath131 , when divided by an approximate age for the cavities , gives an estimate of ( a lower limit to ) the jet power @xmath10 .",
    "when considering both age estimates for the cavities , based on the buoyancy rise - time and sound - speed expansion timescales , @xmath10 is in the range @xmath132 erg s@xmath92 .",
    "this number is @xmath133 of the accretion power @xmath134 derived above .",
    "we calculated the cavity power from our deeper image adopting the same method of @xcite , but rather than using the radio contours as a guide we used instead the x - ray residual map to delineate the cavities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sign3 ] ) .",
    "these are approximated as ellipsoids centered at distance @xmath62 from the smbh and with semi - axes @xmath135 along the radio jet direction ( @xmath136 east of north ) and @xmath137 across it ( the semi axis along the line of sight is taken equal to @xmath137 ) .",
    "the regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sign3 ] have @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 for the n and s cavities , respectively , with a @xmath144 uncertainty on these sizes .",
    "we evaluated an energetic content @xmath145 and @xmath146 for the north and south cavity , respectively .",
    "the sound - speed expansion time has been evaluated as @xmath147 , where @xmath148 @xcite , yielding @xmath149 and @xmath150 for the n and s cavity , respectively .",
    "buoyancy rise times are evaluated as @xmath151 , where @xmath152 . using @xmath153 from eq .",
    "[ equ : he ] we obtain @xmath154 and @xmath155 for the n and s cavity , respectively .",
    "we then obtained for the two n and s cavities , for the sound speed expansion time @xmath156 erg s@xmath92 and @xmath157 erg s@xmath92 , and for the buoyancy rise time @xmath158 erg s@xmath92 and @xmath159 erg s@xmath92 .",
    "the two estimates are compatible between the errors , and give a total @xmath160 erg s@xmath92 ( for the buoyancy rise time ) , and @xmath161 erg s@xmath92 ( for the sound speed expansion time ) .",
    "note that , as mentioned above , this may not be the whole of the mechanical power injected in the hot ism ; shocks are not seen here , though , possibly sound waves . moreover , in addition to the larger cavities close to the ends of the jets , there are other smaller cavities seen in the x - ray gas ( as well as other smaller radio structures , see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the total of @xmath10 is then such that @xmath162 .    in the correlation found by @xcite between @xmath10 and @xmath163 for a sample of elliptical galaxies , on average @xmath164 , a much larger fraction than found here . for ngc 4649 , that has @xmath163 equal to the largest one in the @xcite s sample ,",
    "a larger @xmath10 is predicted from our @xmath163 by their correlation : @xmath165 erg s@xmath92 ( with @xmath166 erg s@xmath92 the lowest value allowed by all the uncertainties on @xmath95 and on the correlation coefficients ) , about 100 times larger the jet power we estimate above .",
    "the @xcite s relation implies that a significant fraction of @xmath163 emerges as kinetic energy , which requires that a significant fraction of the mass entering @xmath167 flows all the way down to the smbh , with little mass loss ( in outflows ) along the way .",
    "this seems not to be the case here , consistent with the results of the previous section , where a significant reduction of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath95 was needed .",
    "a similar result is obtained if one were to infer the accretion rate from the `` observed '' @xmath168 erg s@xmath92 . for the riaf low radiative efficiency",
    ", one would derive @xmath169 yr@xmath92 , that is @xmath170 .",
    "such a value for @xmath94 gives @xmath171 erg s@xmath92 , which can still account for the measured @xmath10 ( and is much closer to it , @xmath172 ) .",
    "it seems so that the same reduction in @xmath94 required by the ( far smaller ) nuclear luminosity could explain also the ( far larger ) accretion output observed in mechanical form .",
    "in addition we note that in principle @xmath10 is an average over the @xmath173 yr age of the cavities , while @xmath125 is a measurement of the instantaneous accretion rate ( since the flow time from @xmath167 to the smbh is very small , of the order of @xmath174 yr ) .",
    "thus when linking @xmath94 to @xmath10 we assume that the accretion flow has been the same over the past @xmath6 few @xmath175 yr . we note that @xcite were not able to reproduce @xcite s relation .",
    "this is mainly due to a different method for delineating the cavities adopted in the two papers , that is , radio maps for @xcite and x - ray maps for @xcite ( the same method adopted in the present paper ) . as a result , the trend between cavity power and bondi power appears significantly weakened in @xcite analysis ( see their figure 11 ) and with a larger scatter due to the different profiles adopted by these authors to extrapolate the gas density profiles to the accretion radius .",
    "note that ngc 4649 does not display extended optical emission line regions and is depleted of molecular and atomic gas , as shown by @xcite , that put an upper limit of @xmath176 to the @xmath177 mass content of this galaxy .",
    "if we assume that the agn mechanical power we evaluate in the cavities is generated by accretion at @xmath178 , the total accreted mass to power the jet would be @xmath179 , well below the upper limit evaluated by @xcite .",
    "however , in ngc 4649 there is ( as in general for hot gas rich galaxies ) a large hot gas reservoir @xmath180 , much larger than the cold gas upper limit .",
    "then , on a secular scale it is more likely that accretion is taking and took place thanks to the hot gas .",
    "even if the primary source of accretion is likely to be the hot gas , however , the low accretion rate we evaluate does not exclude molecular gas as a source of fuel for the smbh , so cold accretion of molecular and atomic gas represents a possible alternate ( or additional ) scenario to bondi accretion .",
    "@xcite re - examined the scaling relationship between jet power , @xmath181 , and synchrotron luminosity at 1.4 ghz and 200 - 400 mhz , incorporating measurements for 21 giant elliptical galaxies , thus expanding the sample of @xcite , dominated by bubbles in clusters , to lower radio power sources .",
    "the @xmath181 was estimated as @xmath10 , the power required to inflate the cavities .",
    "the @xcite s relationship predicts @xmath182 erg s@xmath92 from @xmath183 of ngc 4649 , and between @xmath184 and @xmath185 erg s@xmath92 considering the large scatter around the correlation relation shows a large scatter , possibly due to the fact that the radio emission from lobes depends on their composition , and processes such as gas entrainment , shocks and aging . in the case of ngc 4649",
    "we do not see evidence of shocks .",
    "shurkin et al .",
    "investigated the particle content of the cavities by determining k / f , where k is the ratio of the total particle energy contained in the cavity to the energy accounted for by electrons emitting synchrotron radiation in the range of 10 mhz to 10 ghz , and f is the volume filling factor of the relativistic plasma in the cavity . in general ,",
    "k / f is in the range of @xmath186 to @xmath187 for cavities that are active , while the values for ngc 4649 are very large ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "this could be explained by entrained particles , or electrons that have aged , which is likely given the small radio flux ; ngc 4649 could soon become a ghost cavity system .",
    "] of 0.78 dex .",
    "this range of @xmath10 includes the direct estimate from sect .",
    "[ sec : jet_power ] ( see figure [ fig : cavagnolo ] , left panel ) .",
    "similar results are obtained for the @xcite @xmath189 relation .",
    "thus , ngc 4649 seem to host cavities similar in nature to those of other giant ellipticals , at least for their radio properties , i.e. , the relation between radiative and mechanical energy of the jets .",
    "the nuclear 2 - 10 kev luminosity of ngc 4649 also fits on the correlation between nuclear 2 - 10 kev luminosity and @xmath10 , derived for 27 detected nuclei of central dominant galaxies ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of the sample is in a riaf mode , and the mechanical cavity power dominates the radiative output .",
    "ngc 4649 sits at the lowest values of the correlation , with @xmath190 , from which we can predict @xmath191 erg s@xmath92 ( see figure [ fig : cavagnolo ] , right panel ) . even though also in this correlation the scatter is large , it was taken as evidence that the radiative efficiency of the x - ray nucleus increases with increasing @xmath10 , until the quasar regime is reached ( where the nuclear luminosity becomes comparable to @xmath10 ) .",
    "we investigated the presence of agn feedback in the ism of the giant elliptical ngc 4649 by using a total of 280 ks _",
    "chandra _ observations this source has been studied several times in different wavelength , and in particular in the x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite , making use of _ chandra _ observations , studied the properties of the ism in ngc 4649 using the unsharp - mask technique looking for morphological disturbances pointing to deviations from the hydrostatic equilibrium condition suggested by the generally relaxed x - ray morphology .",
    "interestingly , while the former authors using a shallow @xmath192 observation found evidences of structures and cavities in the ism that they interpreted as connected with the central , faint radio source , the latter authors using deeper @xmath193 data did not found any evidence of such disturbances .",
    "a subsequent analysis by @xcite showed disturbances and cavities in the ism as residuals of the x - ray surface brightness from a spherical @xmath22 model , connected with the radio emission .",
    "using much deeper _ chandra _ data with a total exposure @xmath194 , we used the latter approach to investigate the morphological distribution of the ism in ngc 4649 .",
    "we studied the deviation of the x - ray surface brightness from an elliptical @xmath22 model , which is expected to describe the hot gas distribution in relaxed galaxies .",
    "the residuals of this fitting procedure , presented in figure [ fig : sign10 ] , show significant cavities , ripples and ring like structures on the inner @xmath81 scale .",
    "this is at variance with the @xmath195 significance of the cavities reported by @xcite as evaluated by @xcite .",
    "the deeper data considered here revealed these structures with high significance ; moreover the structures appear to be morphologically related with the central radio emission , with cavities lying in correspondence with the extended radio lobes and regions of enhanced emission situated on the side of them and , on larger scale , taking the form of ring like ripples which seems reminiscent of the structures observed in ngc 1275 @xcite . in common with this source",
    ", we found no significant temperature variations in correspondence with higher pressure regions .",
    "so , if radio ejecta driven shocks are responsible for the observed ism morphology , the observed structures may be isothermal waves whose energy is dissipated by viscosity , with thermal conduction and sound waves effectively distributing the energy from the radio source .",
    "evidences of deviations from the hydrostatic equilibrium are also provided by the mass profiles presented in figure [ fig : masses ] ( left panel ) .",
    "a significant non - thermal pressure is found on the same scale of the residual structures , where it reaches @xmath196 of the observed gas pressure .",
    "in addition , the excess gas pressure and non - thermal pressure profiles appear to be strongly correlated , indicating the radio ejecta as the likely origin for this additional pressure component .    at smaller scales , similarly to a few other early type galaxies harboring low power radio sources , ngc 4649 shows increased temperatures in the inner @xmath54 region .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 4649 appears to be extremely sub - eddington , with the accretion flow emitting less than predicted from the fuel observed to be available , even when allowing for a riaf with angular momentum at the outer radius of the accretion flow .",
    "also the jet power evaluated from the observed x - ray cavities appears to be much smaller than that predicted for elliptical galaxies from the bondi accretion power @xmath163 .",
    "if the mass accretion rate accounting for the observed nuclear x - ray luminosity is adopted - which requires , in addition to a low radiative efficiency , a significant reduction of the accretion rate with respect to the bondi value , due , e.g. , to outflows / convective motions - then the corresponding accretion power @xmath197 is @xmath198 times larger than the observed kinetic power .",
    "when comparing the jet power to radio and nuclear x - ray luminosity , on the other hand , the observed cavities show similar behavior to those of other giant elliptical galaxies .",

    "<S> using the deepest available _ chandra _ observations of ngc 4649 we find strong evidences of cavities , ripples and ring like structures in the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) that appear to be morphologically related with the central radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> these structures show no significant temperature variations in correspondence with higher pressure regions ( @xmath0 ) . on the same spatial scale , a discrepancy between the mass profiles obtained from stellar dynamic and _ chandra _ data represents the telltale evidence of a significant non - thermal pressure component in this hot gas , which is related to the radio jet and lobes . on larger scale </S>",
