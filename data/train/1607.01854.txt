    "consequently , many of the physical properties of graphene are similar to properties characteristic to the physics of quantum electrodynamics , although at much lower speed . in particular , when subject to external magnetic fields graphene exhibits an anomalous integer quantum hall effect that can be observed at room temperature @xcite , a phenomena that is strictly related to the dirac fermions behavior .    from the applications point of view",

    "as mentioned , graphene has a linear , gapless , energy spectrum and exhibits a metallic - like electric conductivity even in the limit of low carrier concentration .",

    "<S> we calculate the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation time and the knight shift for the case of gapped graphene systems . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations consider both the massive and massless gap scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> both the spin - lattice relaxation time and the knight shift depend on temperature , chemical potential , and the value of the electronic energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , at the dirac point , the electronic energy gap has stronger effects on the system nuclear magnetic resonance parameters in the case of the massless gap scenario . </S>",
    "<S> differently , at large values of the chemical potential , both gap scenarios behave in a similar way and the gapped graphene system approaches a fermi gas from the nuclear magnetic resonance parameters point of view . </S>",
    "<S> our results are important for nuclear magnetic resonance measurements that target the @xmath0c active nuclei in graphene samples . </S>"
