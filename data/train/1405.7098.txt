    "we found that there are two narrow @xmath1co  components with velocities centered at @xmath86  km  s@xmath6 and @xmath87  km  s@xmath6 in the shocked clump sc  05 and one narrow @xmath1co  component centered at @xmath48  km  s@xmath6 in the shocked clump d. as two oh masers are adjacent to the two shocked clumps , the @xmath86  km  s@xmath6 and @xmath48  km  s@xmath6 components of the @xmath1co   emission are likely due to the preshock gas while the @xmath87  km  s@xmath6 component might be from the foreground / background mc along the line of sight .",
    "the @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 mcs seems to divide the remnant into the multiwavelength bright part in northeast and the faint breakout part in southwest .",
    "it is noteworthy that the shocked clump g is projected around the centroid of the @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 mcs extending along the southeast  northwest .",
    "figure  12 shows pv diagrams of @xmath0co   and @xmath1co  across the shock clump g along the southwest  northeast ( the short arrow in the right panel of figure  3 ) .",
    "the lsr velocity coincidence between the @xmath1co  line and oh maser emission toward the shocked clump g ( see section 3.1.1 ) indicates that the @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 molecular gas could be associated with snr ic  443 ( figure  12 ) .",

    "we have seen that the partial shell structures of @xmath0coemission in the northeast are concentric with the bright radio border of ic  443 and appear to confine the remnant s faint radio halo in the east . as mentioned in section 3.1.2 , we can see that the northern and northeastern partial shells , together with the eastern small clumps , form a half - ring structure to surround snr ic  443 ( the left panel in figure  7 ) .",
    "the lsr velocity range of the half - ring structure is consistent with the @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 co component .",
    "this is also consistent with the lsr velocity of the quiescent , ambient molecular gas of the shocked clumps b , e , f , and g ( table  1 ) .",
    "the half - ring structure distribution along the northeastern half of the remnant indicates the high density there . on the contrary",
    ", the density is very low in the southwestern half of the remnant , in which snr ic  443 displays the breakout structure .",
    "moreover , the half - ring structure seems to confine the remnant s faint radio halo in the northeastern part ( figure  7 ) .",
    "the lsr velocity consistency between the half - ring structure and the @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 mcs ( figure  3 ) and the positional coincidence between the ring structure and the remnant s radio halo ( figure  7 ) indicate that the half - ring structure with an lsr velocity of @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 is associated with snr ic  443 .",
    "we also note that there are no emissions in the other bands corresponding to the half - ring structure , and the structure is unlikely shocked by the snr .",
    "the half - ring structure is probably related to the stellar winds of the remnant s massive progenitor star ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "we have shown that snr ic  443 is located in the environment of the dense gas ( troja et al .",
    "the remnant was likely from a core - collapse explosion of a massive progenitor star , although the tail of the pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) does not point toward the geometric center of the remnant ( olbert et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the scenario that snr ic  443 is evolving inside the preexisting wind - blown bubble was suggested by several authors ( braun & strom 1986 ; troja et al . 2006 , 2008 ; lee et al . 2008",
    "; yamaguchi et al . 2009 ) . the half - ring structure ( e.g. , the left panel in figure  7 ) , which is discovered in our @xmath0co  and @xmath1coobservations , appears to confine the faint radio halo .",
    "we propose that the half - ring structure originates from the interaction between the ic  443 s progenitor winds and its surrounding mcs . assuming that the northeastern partial shell structures were formed by the gas swept by the wind of the remnant s massive progenitor , the volume ratio between the partial shell ( a cylinder - like volume with a diameter of 15 and a height of 7@xmath4 assumed ) and the original rectangular pyramid ( a volume with a base area of @xmath93 and a height of 26@xmath4 assumed ) is about 0.14 . adopting the mean molecular density of the partial shell structures of @xmath94  @xmath95 ( see section 3.1.2 )",
    ", the mean density in the original rectangular pyramid would be @xmath96140  @xmath95 for the cloudy ism environment .",
    "we find that the mean density of our estimation is consistent with the 170  @xmath95 estimation of braun & strom ( 1986 ) .",
    "the massive stellar winds will sweep a dense shell from the homogenized region and leave a low - density bubble around the star . using formulae ( 51 ) and ( 52 ) in weaver et al .",
    "( 1977 ) and assuming @xmath96140  @xmath95 and @xmath97  pc ( 26@xmath4 at a distance of 1.5  kpc ) , we compute the value of the mechanical luminosity @xmath98 , which roughly corresponds to a value typical for the b0 star ( table  1 in chen et al . 2013 ) for shaping a bubble with the expansion velocity of the order of magnitude of 1  km  s@xmath6 ( table  2 ) .",
    "since the expanding velocity of the half - ring structure is very low , we think that the bubble is nearly stalled in the ism .",
    "therefore , we use the linear relationship to assess the initial masses of the progenitors for snrs associated with mcs ( chen et al . 2013 ) . considering the blowout structure of snr ic  443 , the remnant s progenitor mass of 1519",
    "@xmath99 is a lower limit , which is consistent with the above calculation for a b0 star .    because of the multi - shell morphology of this remnant , the sn explosion site is difficult to determine .",
    "the blast center and geometric center of an snr can be different given the large - scale density gradients of the surrounding medium .",
    "assuming that the explosion site is the geometrical center of the half - ring structure , the distance between the explosion site and the pwn is about 157 ( 6.8  pc at a distance of 1.5  kpc ) . adopting @xmath100  km  s@xmath6 ( olbert et al .",
    "2001 ) , snr ic  443 is estimated to be in an age of @xmath101  yr , which is consistent with other authors results ( e.g. , chevalier 1999 ; lee et al .",
    "2008 , 2012 ) .",
    "it is different from the estimation based on x - ray observations ( petre et al .",
    "1988 ; asaoka & aschenbach 1994 ; troja et al . 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "we outline the molecular environment around snr ic  443 .",
    "the molecular gas environing snr ic  443 was modified by the winds of the massive progenitor star and the remnant is evolving in the medium with a nonuniform distribution of gas .",
    "the remnant evolved in the pre - existing cavity blown by the stellar winds of the high - mass progenitor and interacted with the preexisting cavity .",
    "the northeastern part bright in multiwavelengths is due to the high density environment , while the southwestern part displays the breakout structure because of the low - density environment locally , which agree with that presented by mufson et al .",
    "( 1986 ) . in the south , the shock of the snr is interacting with the ambient molecular clumps .",
    "the dense clumps belong to the @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 mcs component and still survive from the progenitor s winds .",
    "generally , snr ic  443 evolved in the medium with large scale density gradient along the southeast - northwest .",
    "the half - ring structure from the east to the northwest discovered by us was likely blown by the massive winds of the remnant s massive progenitor star .      generally , class i objects are likely younger on average than class ii ysos . in figure  11",
    "( see section 3.2 ) , we find that the class i and ii ysos are much more projectively concentrated in the region of the northeastern part of snr ic  443 .",
    "interestingly , most of class i ysos ( blue triangles ) are located along the boundary of the bright radio shell of the remnant . because of the coincidence between the distribution of our identified yso candidates and the remnant s morphology , it is unlikely that these yso candidates are the foreground and background stars .",
    "therefore we suggest that these ysos projected on the fov of the remnant are probably associated with snr ic  443 . considering the age difference between the ysos ( @xmath102@xmath103  yr ) and the remnant ( @xmath104@xmath105  yr ) , we suggest that these ysos are likely to be triggered by the stellar winds from the progenitor of ic  443 ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "xu et al . (",
    "2011 ) used the 2mass all - sky point source database in the near - ir @xmath19(1.25 @xmath39 m ) , @xmath81(1.65 @xmath39 m ) , and @xmath88 ( 2.17 @xmath39 m ) bands to look for primary tracers of star formation activity in the vicinity of ic  443 .",
    "they identified 1666 yso candidates in a search circle around ic  443 within a 25@xmath4 radius , whose number is greater than ours .",
    "it is probable that some yso candidates selected by xu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have flat seds and should be rejected ( e.g. , rebull et al .",
    "we show the sed diagrams for the 98 sources in figure  14 . actually , using 2mass data",
    ", we identified 260 ysos ( including classical t tauri stars and herbig ae / be stars ) with an s / n greater than 3 .",
    "xu et al . ( 2011 ) proposed that the distribution of yso candidates may show a shell morphology ( see figure  5(b ) in their paper ) .",
    "interestingly , the similar shell structure of the distribution of our yso candidates can be seen roughly in figure  11 .",
    "the radius of the shell structure is @xmath1520@xmath4 , which is surrounded by the radio halo of snr ic  443 .",
    "whitworth et al . (",
    "1994 ) have studied the fragmentation of the shocked dense shells swept up by an expanding stellar wind bubble .",
    "adopting a reasonable value of @xmath106140  @xmath95 , @xmath107 ( see section 4.3 ) , and the effective sound speed @xmath108=0.2  km  s@xmath6 , we can estimate the time at which the fragmentation begins , @xmath1095.7  myr and the radius of the shell at that time , @xmath11010.8  pc .",
    "this result is roughly compatible with the value of 9  pc ( 20@xmath4 at 1.5  kpc ) .",
    "we fit yso models to 75/98 sources combined 2mass+@xmath36 bands ( see columns 38 in table  3 ) based on the work of robitaille et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; 57/75 sources were well fitted ( @xmath111 less than 12 ) .",
    "the estimated age is between 0.01  myr and several megayears .",
    "we emphasized that the sed models are often highly ambiguous because the models show a high degree of degeneracy .",
    "therefore , the stellar parameters are often uncertain , especially if only ir photometry is available .",
    "spectroscopic information is needed to estimate the actual age of these yso candidates . on the other hand , since these sources are class i and class ii sources , the typical lifetimes for these sources are considered to be 0.5  myr and 23  myr ( evans et al .",
    "2009 ) , respectively .",
    "it is also compatible with the general evolutionary scheme of the progenitor s wind of snr ic  443 .",
    "it is common that many low - mass stars will experience nearby supernovae . when a massive star dies as a supernova , the ejecta of it will expand freely through the hot , tenuous interior of an region",
    "subsequently , the gaseous ejecta from the supernova hits a protoplanetary disk to form a bow shock structure .",
    "chevalier ( 2000 ) showed that a protoplanetary disk around a young star can survive from the nearby supernova explosion .",
    "our solar system had very likely experienced such a process and survived from the extreme environment .",
    "recent isotopic analysis of meteorites have revealed that the sun and the solar system formed near a massive star and experienced a supernova explosion ( hester & desch 2005 ) .",
    "briefly , the explosion of the supernova plays an essential role for the formation and evolution of the solar system ( tachibana et al .",

    "in either case , the @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 mc component , for which the centroid of the molecular gas near the center of the remnant is consistent with the centroid of the gev  tev emission , could play an essential role for the observed @xmath112-ray emission . recently , ackermann et al .",
    "( 2013 ) identified the characteristic pion - decay feature in the gamma - ray emission .",
