    "the cooling of neutron stars has been used by many authors @xcite as a way of probing the internal composition of these objects .",
    "such studies rely on the fact that the physical quantities relevant for the cooling ( specific heat , thermal conductivity , and neutrino emissions ) strongly depend on the microscopic composition , so that different models lead to different thermal evolutions . for such studies ,",
    "the predicted thermal evolution is compared to the observed data , with the ultimate goal of constraining the microscopic properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "an example of this is the recent analysis of the observed thermal behavior of the compact star in cassiopeia a ( cas a ) @xcite . in these studies",
    "the authors link the observed thermal behavior of this neutron star to the onset of superfluidity in the stellar core .",
    "possible alternative explanations have been suggested in @xcite , where the observed data was explained in terms of the nuclear medium cooling scenario @xcite , and the a late onset of the direct urca process , triggered by the gravitational compression that accompanies a spinning - down neutron star @xcite .    in the standard approach ,",
    "studies of the thermal evolution of neutron stars are performed by assuming that these stars are spherically symmetric .",
    "this assumption renders the thermal evolution calculations inherently one - dimensional ( 1d ) , which greatly simplifies the numerical treatment .",
    "however , as pointed out by us in @xcite , rotation may play a very important role for the cooling of neutron stars .",
    "in @xcite the effects of rotation on the microscopic composition , and its consequences for cooling , were studied . in the work presented here",
    "we investigate the macroscopic aspects of rotation on the cooling of neutron stars in the framework of a fully self - consistent two - dimensional ( 2d ) treatment .",
    "we shall consider the thermal evolution of rigidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "first we calculate the rotational structures of such stars , which is considerably more complicated than for spherically symmetric stars .",
    "the stellar structure is obtained by solving einstein s field equation for a rotationally deformed 2d fluid @xcite . the numerical method used here",
    "is based on the keh method @xcite .",
    "the equation of state used for computing the global neutron star properties and its composition is a relativistic non - linear mean field ( rmf ) model , whose parameters are adjusted to the properties of nuclear matter at saturation density @xcite .",
    "once the structure of a rotating neutron star is computed , we solve the equations that govern the thermal evolution .",
    "the latter equations are re - derived for the metric of a 2d rotating neutron star . we show that the cooling of the object strongly depends on its frequency . at higher frequencies , rotating neutron stars show a substantial temperature difference between the equator and the pole .",
    "we also show that the time scale for the thermalization of such stars increases with its frequency .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we discuss the energy balance and transport equations for a rotating neutron star . in section [ sec : surftemp ] we show the results for the surface temperature evolution of rotating neutron stars .",
    "the internal temperature evolution is discussed in section [ sec : inttemp ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "given the complex nature of rotating neutron stars , where effects like frame dragging ( lense - thirring effect ) and additional self - consistency conditions ( e.g.  mass shedding , which sets an absolute limit on rapid rotation ) are in place , carrying out a 2d study of the thermal evolution of such objects is a challenging task .",
    "first steps toward this direction were made in @xcite .",
    "we note that the 2d cooling of magnetized neutron stars has been previously studied in @xcite , where the 2d effects of the magnetic field in the crust were investigated , and first steps towards a consistent magneto - thermal evolution simulation were taken .",
    "the cooling simulations performed in @xcite are based on a standard spherically symmetric metric , since this study focused primarily on the impact of magnetic field effects on cooling . differently from @xcite , we are presenting full 2d calculations of the thermal evolution of rotating neutron stars , taking into account the 2d metric of a rotating fluid distribution .",
    "the latter can be written as @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the quantities @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote metric functions , and @xmath6 accounts for the dragging of local inertial frames caused by the rotating fluid .",
    "all these quantities are functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and are implicitly dependent on @xmath6 .",
    "they need to be computed self - consistently from einstein s field equation , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the fluid s energy momentum tensor .",

    "this issue can be resolved by assuming that portions of the hadronic matter in the cores of neutron stars are in a superfluid state @xcite .",
    "the presence of an enhanced cooling process allows us to track the heat propagation more clearly inside the rotating neutron star .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for rotating stars , the cold front originating from the stellar core is more intense ( due to stronger neutrino emission , see @xcite ) , and thus easier to track .    as for the neutrino emission processes taking place in the core",

    "the consequences of superfluidity / superconductivity , along with the cooper - pair breaking / formation process , on the thermal evolution of rotating neutron stars will be presented in a follow - up study .",
    "we now present the results for the thermal evolution of rotating neutron stars . we analyze the thermal evolution of three different stellar configurations , each one with the same central density but rotating at different selected frequencies , ranging from around 100  hz to 800  hz ( see table [ table : stars ] ) .",
    "the choice of this frequency range is motivated by theoretical calculations of the mapping between initial and final neutron star spins , likely spin - down mechanisms , and observational constraints from pulsars and supernova energetics . on this basis , it has been argued @xcite that the initial pre - collapse central iron core periods inside of massive stars , which give birth to neutron stars and pulsars , are on average greater than around 50 seconds .",
    "the associated neutron stars would then be born with rotation periods greater than around 10 ms @xcite .",
    "considering the many poorly understood features associated with the birth of rotating neutron stars , such as the estimated iron core spin rates , angular momentum profiles , progenitor masses , and general relativistic effects , the central iron core periods may be smaller by a factor of 5 , however , in which case the birth periods of neutron stars increases to around 1000  hz .",
    "observationally , the most rapidly rotating neutron star , psr j1748 - 2446ad , rotates at 716  hz @xcite , followed by the 642  hz pulsar b1937 + 21 @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been noted that the low mass x - ray binary sax j1750.8 - 2900 may have a spin frequency of 601 hz , and that this object may be the most luminous known neutron star @xcite .",

    "[ t_int ] ( a ) also shows that the core is much colder than the outer layers , which is a consequence of the fast core cooling via the du process .",

    "the objective of this work was is to investigate in detail the cooling of rotationally deformed neutron stars in 2 dimensions ( 2d ) .",

    ". this might be the case for highly magnetized neutron stars , neutron stars that are spinning down from high to low rotation rates , as well as for accreting neutron stars which are being spun up to high rotation rates .",
    "this work represents the first step towards a widely applicable , fully self - consistent treatment of the cooling of neutron stars whose spherical symmetries have been broken .",
    "as a first step in this direction , we considered here rigidly rotating , rotationally deformed neutron stars .",
    "the metric of such objects is significantly different from the metric of spherically symmetric stars ; we therefore re - derived the general relativistic equations that govern the thermal evolution of such stars .",
    "the microscopic model for the equation of state ( eos ) which was used in our study is that of purely hadronic matter , with the whole baryon octet included .",
    "this model for the eos allows for the direct urca process in stars with masses above 1.0  @xmath68 , which leads to enhanced stellar cooling .",
    "this choice for the equation of state was intentional , since the direct urca process yields sharper temperature gradients inside the star , which allow us to track the energy transport more clearly .",
    "after obtaining a solid understanding of the thermal evolution of rotating compact stars , our study will be applied in a future study to compact objects with more complex core compositions , such as hadronic superfluids , boson condensates , or quark matter .      *",
    "the redshifted temperature of the pole is slightly higher than the temperature at the equator , which is due the difference in surface gravity between these two regions . *",
    "thermal energy is more efficiently transported along the polar direction , due to the lower fluid velocities and thinner crust there .",
    "this allows a `` cold front '' , originating from the core , to arrive at the pole sooner than at the equator .    with respect to the second item above",
    ", we have found that the increase in the core - crust coupling time is independent of all stellar properties , except the frequency .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the crusts of the neutron star at different rotational stages are very similar regardless of their core composition , and that the only factor ( in the present study ) that alters the macroscopic properties of the crust is rotation .",
