    "uniform and accurate photometric calibration plays a central role in the current and next - generation wide - field imaging surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , the dark energy survey ( des ; the des collaboration 2010 ) , pan - starrs ( kaiser et al . 2002 ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; ivezi et al .",
    "accurate photometric calibrations over wide areas are pivotal for robust object classifications , determinations of photometric redshifts of a large number of galaxies to probe the large - scale structure of the universe ( e.g. padmanabhan et al . 2007 ; blake et al . 2007 ) , and for topographical studies of the galactic structure via a large number of stars whose basic properties can be obtained from the photometric magnitudes and colors ( e.g. juri et al .",
    "2008 ; ivezi et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "astronomical optical photometric measurements are traditionally calibrated based on sets of standard stars , such as the landolt s ( landolt 1992 ) and stetson s ( stetson 2000 , 2005 ) . however , achieving a one per cent precision for ground - based wide field imaging surveys is difficult given the spatial and temporal variations of the earth atmospheric transmission and the instrumental effects such as flat - fielding ( e.g. stubbs & tonry 2006 ) .    to pursuit a one per cent accuracy for large field imaging surveys ,",
    "a number of different approaches have been proposed and implemented .",
    "one main approach is to decouple the problem of  relative \" calibrations ( i.e. , producing an internally consistent system ) from that of  absolute \" calibrations ( i.e. , connecting the internal system to a physical flux scale ) using observations from the overlapping regions ( e.g. , ivezi et al .",
    "2007 , hereafter i07 ; padmanabhan et al . 2008",
    "; schlafly et al .",
    "2012 ) . the absolute calibration for the whole survey",
    "is then reduced to the determinations of a few numbers . applying the ( ubercal ) method to the whole sdss imaging data ,",
    "padmanabhan et al . have achieved about 1 per cent relative calibration for @xmath5 , and @xmath0 bands and about 2 per cent for @xmath6 band .",
    "these errors are dominated by the unmodeled variations of atmospheric transmission . applying a similar method to the repeatedly scanned ( at least four times per band , with a median of 10 times per band ) sdss stripe",
    "82 data , i07 have constructed a standard star catalog in the sdss @xmath7 system containing about 1 million objects with an internal photometric accuracy of 1 per cent [ i.e. the spatial variations of the photometric zero points across the stripe survey area is smaller than 0.01mag ( rms ) ] .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is that i07 use a different algorithm for flat - field corrections , requiring that the stellar loci ( ivezi et al .",
    "2004 ; covey et al .",
    "2007 ) remain fixed in multi - dimensional color space , whereas padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) achieve so by minimizing the relative photometric errors of repeated observations .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the stellar locus regression method ( slr ; high et al .",
    "2009 ) , which aims to achieve real - time , accurate color calibration using direct measurements from multi - band , flat - fielded images for a given field .",
    "note that colors hold the key information about a source s type , temperature , metallicity , and redshift . thus achieving accurate color calibration",
    "is often more important than deriving highly accurate ( absolute ) magnitudes in many astronomical applications , in particular considering the fact that we seldom know the distances to individual celestial objects to a per cent level .",
    "the slr method makes a wholesale correction for a variety of potential effects , including variations in instrumental sensitivity , in the earth atmospheric extinction and reddening , and in the galactic interstellar extinction and reddening by adjusting the instrumental broadband optical colors of stars to bring them into accord with a universal set of stellar color loci .",
    "the method is able to produce calibrated colors accurate to a few per cent .",
    "the approach needs neither estimates of zero point for individual passbands nor repeated measurements of the standard stars , and can be performed in real - time as the survey progresses .",
    "however , the slr method assumes the stellar loci are universal , an assumption that is not always true , given the variations of stellar populations and the interstellar extinction , especially in the galactic disk .",
    "it also requires a blue filter in addition to at least two other filters .",
    "in addition to imaging photometry for over 10,000 deg@xmath8 , the sdss has delivered low - resolution spectra for about 0.7million stars in its data release 9 ( dr9 ; ahn et al .",
    "2012 ) . by june 2014 , the lamost galactic surveys",
    "( deng et al . 2012 ; liu et al .",
    "2014 ) have collected over 3 m stellar spectra and the stellar parameters ( bai et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ; yuan et al .",
    ", 2014a ) for over half of them .",
    "the surveys will eventually obtain over 6 million spectra upon the completion in three years time . with millions of stellar spectra over large sky area now available , ",
    "identical \" stars located in different environments but otherwise having nearly identical atmospheric characteristics can be easily paired and compared to measure the interstellar reddening of stars suffering from substantial extinction ( yuan , liu & xiang 2013 ) , as well as to detect and measure the strengths of the diffuse interstellar bands along hundreds of thousands sightlines ( yuan & liu 2012 ) , assuming that stars of the same set of atmospheric parameters ( , log  @xmath9  and [ fe / h ] ) possess the same intrinsic colors and spectra . to take advantage of this era of millions of stellar spectra and the fact that stars observed spectroscopically serve as excellent color standards , here we propose a spectroscopy based stellar color regression ( scr ) method for accurate relative color ( re-)calibration of modern large sky area wide field imaging surveys .",
    "to apply the method , one requires that : 1 ) a few well - calibrated fields are available .",
    "spectroscopic reference stars selected from those defining fields are used to determine the stellar intrinsic colors as a function of the atmospheric parameters ; 2 ) the reddening law does not vary within the sky area of a ( target ) field to be calibrated ; and 3 ) a sub - sample of stars in the field to be calibrated have been spectroscopically targeted and the reddening values of those targets are known . with those information , the zero points of colors can be derived by linear regression between the reddening and the color offsets of stars of the target field relative to the intrinsic colors . by this way",
    ", the whole survey fields can be brought on a uniform color scale .",
    "note that in cases where the reference fields have a calibration error , the method brings the photometry of all fields onto a uniform , internally consistent color scale that may have an overall offset from the true color scale .",
    "this is analogous to the ubercalibration algorithm ( padmanabhan et al .",
    "2008 ) that brings the photometry of the whole survey footprint in each bandpass to a uniform scale that may have an overall offset from the ab system .",
    "the method yields simultaneously the reddening coefficients as a by - product . compared to the slr method , the scr method has the advantages of being straightforward , model - free and applicable to large sky area encompassing a variety of environments ( galactic halo and disk , regions of low or high extinction ) that are effectively covered by large - scale spectroscopic surveys such as the sdss and lamost .",
    "given a spectroscopic sampling density of a few hundred stars per deg@xmath8 , and a precision of respectively 30  100k , 0.1  0.25dex , and 0.05  0.1dex for the spectroscopically yielded atmospheric parameters , log  @xmath9  and [ fe / h ]  ( lee et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b ; wu et al . 2011",
    "; xiang et al . 2014 ) , the scr method is capable of delivering a few mmag accuracy for relative color calibration .    to demonstrate the power and performance of the scr method ,",
    "we have applied the method to the stripe 82 data of i07 . as demonstrated by i07 with a variety of independent tests , the spatial variations of the photometric zero points",
    "must be no larger than 0.01 mag in @xmath10 bands and 0.02 mag in @xmath6 band ( rms ) . applying the scr method to a sample of 23,759 spectroscopically targeted stars of stripe82 in a sky area of about 80 per deg@xmath8 ,",
    "we have confirmed the conclusions of i07 .",
    "however , the study also reveals small yet substantial and tightly correlated spatial variations in the color zero points across the stripe , and are ascribed to the degeneracies intrinsic to the i07 calibration .",
    "possible color and magnitude dependence of the variations is also examined .",
    "small but significant magnitude dependence is found in @xmath0-band for some ccds .",
    "our results are compared with those from a completely independent test based on the intrinsic colors of red galaxies .",
    "the comparison confirms that the scr method has achieved a calibration accuracy of or better than 5 mmag in color @xmath1 , 3 mmag in color @xmath2 , and 2 mmag in colors @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties are only a factor of two larger than what expected from the random errors alone .",
    "the method can thus serve as an extremely powerful and robust tools to calibrate existing , on - going , and up - coming large scale imaging surveys , including the sdss , des , pan - starrs , and lsst .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the method . in section3",
    ", the method is applied to the sdss stripe 82 region to demonstrate its performance and recalibrate the data .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are given in section4 .",
    "the current method is built on the spectroscopic ",
    "star pair \" technique ( yuan & liu 2012 ; yuan , liu & xiang 2013 ) , taking advantage of millions of stellar spectra and parameters now available over a large sky area . the star pair technique has been used to estimate multi - band interstellar reddening and reddening coefficients of a large number of stars targeted by the sdss ( yuan , liu & xiang 2013 ) and by the lamost ( yuan et al .",
    "2014a ) , and to detect and measure the diffuse interstellar bands in thousands of the sdss spectra ( yuan & liu 2012 ) .",
    "unlike in the above work where star pairs are composed of target and control stars from high and low extinction regions , respectively , in the current work they are composed of target and control stars from the fields to be calibrated and from those of well calibrated , reference fields that are used to define the stellar intrinsic colors as a function of stellar atmospheric parameters . for each star in the target sample ,",
    "its control stars are selected from the control sample as those having values of , log  @xmath9  and [ fe / h ]  that differ from those of the target by less than 200 k , 0.25 dex , and 0.5 dex , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic colors of the target are derived by linearly interpolating the intrinsic colors of its control stars in  and [ fe / h ] .",
    "linear interpolation should be sufficient given the small ranges of values of parameters being considered .",
    "the dependence of colors on log  @xmath9  has been ignored here .",
    "stars with less than three control stars are not used .",
    "this method requires that a sub - sample of target stars in a given field to be calibrated have been spectroscopically observed and their reddening values in a certain color are available , say from the 2d extinction map of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ; sfd hereafter ) for targets at high galactic latitudes or derived using the star pair technique of yuan , liu & xiang ( 2013 ) from existing and well calibrated photometric surveys for targets at low galactic latitudes .",
    "the reddening law should also not vary across the field to be calibrated ( thus the field should not be too large and encompass different environments ) . in general ,",
    "the reddening law is expected to show no or only marginal spatial variations at high galactic latitudes . in the galactic disk , it is however known to vary significantly and data to constrain such variations are now available ( e.g. yuan et al .",
    "2014a ) . finally to obtain a highly accurate definition of the stellar intrinsic colors as a function of atmospheric parameters , one or a few photometrically and spectroscopically",
    "well - calibrated fields are needed .",
    "those fields will be used to determine the intrinsic colors from a given set of stellar parameters .",
    "then for a given target field to be calibrated , the method obtains its color zero point by performing a linear regression between the reddening and color offsets relative to the intrinsic colors using the sub - sample of spectroscopically targeted stars of the field .",
    "calibrating each target field by this way , this method will bring the whole survey on a uniform color scale .",
    "this process will also yield the reddening coefficients of each target field as a by - product .",
    "fig.1 schematically illustrates the method .",
    "note that if the reddening coefficient is previously known , then the slope of regression can be fixed when fitting the data .",
    "the accuracy achievable with the method is controlled by : 1 ) the random errors of color measurements ; 2 ) the random errors of atmospheric parameters of the reference stars as well as of the spectroscopically targeted sub - sample of stars in the fields to be calibrated ; 3 ) the random errors and breadth of range spread by the reddening values of the spectroscopic sub - sample of target stars ; and 4 ) the size of the spectroscopic sub - sample of target stars in the individual target fields . for modern digital imaging surveys , the random errors of measured colors",
    "are typically at 1  2 per cent level at good signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) .",
    "the random errors of stellar atmospheric parameters derivable from low- and medium resolution ( @xmath11 ) spectra of snrs better than 20 with those widely used stellar parameter pipelines [ such as the sspp  the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ; yanny et al .",
    "2009 ) stellar parameter pipeline ( lee et al .",
    "2008a , b ) , or the lsp3  the lamost stellar parameter pipeline at peking university ( xiang et al . 2014 ) ] are at a level of 0.005  0.01 dex",
    "( i.e. , about 75  150k at 6,000 k ) in   and 0.05  0.1dex in [ fe / h ] . systematic errors in the stellar atmospheric parameters do not affect the performance of the scr method , as they are cancelled out . taking the sdss colors for example , a 0.01 dex change in  for fgk stars will lead to variations of 0.08 , 0.04 , 0.013 , and 0.010 mag in colors @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "similarly , a 0.1 dex change in [ fe / h ]  for fgk stars can cause about variations of 0.05 , 0.023 , and 0.01 mag in color @xmath1 at [ fe / h ]  =  0 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13dex , respectively , and essentially nil ( @xmath14 0.015mag ) in the other three colors .    at high galactic latitudes , reddening values of the target stars can be obtained from the sfd extinction map , or the planck extinction map ( planck collaboration et al .",
    "the random errors of the sfd extinction are very small , although their values are known to suffer from some systematic errors due to a scaling problem ( e.g. schlafly et al .",
    "2010 ; schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ; yuan , liu & xiang 2013 ) .",
    "in the scr method , those systematics however can be taken care of by the reddening coefficients , and thus should not affect its results . at low galactic latitudes where the sfd extinction map is not usable , reddening values of the target stars can be derived using the star pair technique ( yuan , liu & xiang 2013 ) or , alternatively , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting method ( e.g. berry et al . 2012 ) .",
    "for example , using the sed fitting method , chen et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have determined the reddening values for over 13 million stars within the footprint of the xuyi schmidt telescope photometric survey of the galactic anti - centre ( xstps - gac ; liu et al .",
    "2014 ) by combining the xstps - gac optical photometry and the near infrared photometry of 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",

    "2014 ) , over a million already , reddening values have also been deduced using the star pair method and released in the value - added catalogs ( yuan et al .",
    "2014a ) supplementary to the lamost official data release .",
    "the random errors of reddening values thus obtained after converted into @xmath15  are typically between 0.02 to 0.1 mag , depending on which datasets are available .",
    "there are however some degeneracies between the color calibration and reddening coefficient determinations . if the stars in a given target field span a wide range of reddening values ( relative to the uncertainties of reddening ) , which is likely the case for high extinction regions of low galactic latitudes , the reddening coefficients and the color zero points can be robustly determined . in cases where the reddening values of the target stars are large yet span a narrow range , incorporating a prior distribution of reddening coefficients with a bayesian approach may be needed to improve the accuracy of color calibration . for high galactic latitude fields where the reddening values of target stars are small and span a narrow range , fixing the reddening coefficients to some pre - determined values",
    "is probably favored .",
    "the number of spectroscopically targeted stars is about one hundred to a few hundred per deg@xmath8 , as afforded by surveys such as the sdss and lamost .",
    "here we have neglected the random errors of reddening of the reference stars considering that the reference stars are usually selected from well - calibrated , low extinction regions and thus suffer from negligible uncertainties in reddening corrections .",
    "given the above constrains , a few per cent accuracy in color measurements is capable of delivering a few mmag accuracy in color calibration with the scr method , as we shall show in the next section .",
    "the scr method can be used to check the calibration accuracies of existing photometric data and recalibrate them .",
    "any systematic photometric errors present in the calibrated data , except for grey ones that are the same in different bands , will reveal themselves as offsets in dereddened colors with respect to the intrinsic values . in this section",

    "the results are listed in table2 of the appendix and plotted in fig.4 . given the number of stars in each bin ( about 200 ) and the typical errors of color offsets for a single star are about 0.039 , 0.019 , 0.013 , and 0.013 mag for the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 colors ,",
    "the median color offsets of each bin have errors of about 2.8 , 1.3 , 0.9 , and 0.9 mmag , respectively for the four colors .",
    "the peak - to - peak variations are 0.058 , 0.034 , 0.020 , and 0.017 mag in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 colors , respectively .",
    "the offsets in all colors display similar patterns and the variations are well correlated .",
    "most offsets are negative in the range @xmath38 ra @xmath39 and positive out of the range . the results are consistent with an independent test of i07 based on the colors of 19,377 red galaxies color , 0.05mag in the @xmath2 color , and 0.03mag in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 colors ( i07 ) . ] , where they find that the colors are redder around ra @xmath40 than around ra @xmath41 .",
    "to compare our results and those of i07 based on the galaxy colors , we have overplotted the latter in fig.4 as blue lines , and found that they agree remarkably well .",
    "note that i07 use a coarser spatial resolution , i.e. , a total number of 11 bins in @xmath1 and 55 bins in other colors .",
    "after corrected for the spatial variations of color offsets in ra , the spatial variations of color offsets in dec are plotted in fig.5 .",
    "following i07 , the median color offsets are computed for 0.01@xmath42 wide bins , and then smoothed using a triangular filter [ i.e. , @xmath43 is replaced by @xmath44 .",
    "the results are overplotted in fig.5 and listed in table3 of the appendix .",
    "each bin contains about 80 stars . after the smoothing ,",
    "the errors of the median color offsets of the individual bins are about 3.0 , 1.5 , 1.0 and 1.0 mmag in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 colors , respectively .",
    "the corresponding peak - to - peak variations in the four colors are 0.075 , 0.033 , 0.017 , and 0.023 mag , respectively .",
    "the offsets in all colors display similar patterns of variations and are well correlated . for comparison",
    ", we have also overplotted in fig.5 the independent test results of i07 for color @xmath45 based on the colors of red galaxies .",
    "our results are consistent with those of i07 .",
    "the test results of i07 for other colors based on the colors of red galaxies are not publicly available .              after correcting for @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we investigate the possible dependence of the remaining color offsets on source magnitudes and colors .",
    "the offsets may vary with source magnitudes as a consequence of ( improper corrections of ) the non - linearity of the detectors , whereas color - dependent variations may result from ( improper corrections of ) the bandpass variations amongst the different camera columns or from the wavelength - dependent variations of the earth atmospheric transmissivity .",
    "the non - linearity of detectors have been corrected for by the sdss photometric pipeline to an accuracy of better than 5 mmag , so no more corrections are applied in i07 .",
    "if any effects of the non - linearity remain , they should exist in all the sdss photometric data .",
    "the bandpass differences amongst the six ccd columns can lead to discrepancies in photometric colors at 1 per cent level , and have been corrected for by incorporating some by color terms in i07 ( see their table1 ) .",
    "the potential wavelength - dependent variations of the earth atmospheric transmissivity have been neglected in i07 due to the lack of usable data .",
    "the effects are however believed to be small .",
    "fig.7 plots variations of @xmath1 color offsets as a function of @xmath9 magnitude , @xmath2 color offsets as a function of @xmath20 magnitude , @xmath3 color offsets as a function of @xmath21 magnitude , and @xmath4 color offsets as a function of @xmath0 magnitude for the six sdss ccd columns .",
    "no obvious variations with magnitudes are found except for the @xmath4 colors measured by four of the six ccd columns . for the latter , variations over 20 mmag are observed .",
    "since no variations in the @xmath3 color offsets are detected , the variations of @xmath4 color offsets with @xmath0 magnitude are likely caused by ( improper corrections of ) the non - linearity of detectors for the @xmath0 band .",
    "we have performed a 2nd - order polynomial fit to the observed variations of @xmath4 color offsets as a function of @xmath0 magnitude for the four ccd columns where the variations are seen .",
    "the results are overplotted in red in fig.7 and the fit coefficients are listed in table1 .",
    "fig.8 plots color offsets in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 colors as a function of @xmath48 for the six sdss ccd columns .",
    "no obvious variations are found for stars bluer than @xmath49mag . for redder stars",
    ", fig.8 seems to indicate that there might be some small systematic variations at the level of about 1 mmag in @xmath1 and about 0.5 mmag in the other three colors .",
    "the variations might be caused by the fact that red dwarfs are all local objects and , for at least some of them , the reddening corrections have been overestimated .",
    "given the very small magnitudes of variation , we have opted to not correct for those possible variations ."
