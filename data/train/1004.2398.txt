    "the technique of coupling of reflecting brownian motions is a useful tool used by several authors in connection to the study of the neumann heat kernel of the corresponding domain ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc ) .    in a series of paper ,",

    "the main difficulty in the extending the construction of the mirror coupling comes from the fact that the stochastic differential equation(s ) describing the mirror coupling has a singularity at the times when coupling occurs . in the case @xmath4 considered by burdzy",
    "this problem is not a major problem ( although the technical details are quite involved , see atarburdzy2 ) , since after the coupling time the processes move together . in the case",
    "@xmath5 however , this is a major problem : after processes have coupled , it is possible for them to decouple ( for example in the case when the processes are coupled and they hit the boundary of one of the domains ) .    it is worth mentioning that the method used for proving the existence of the solution is new , and it relies on the additional hypothesis that the smaller domain @xmath6 ( or more generally @xmath7 ) is a convex domain .",
    "this hypothesis allows us to construct an explicit set of solutions in a sequence of approximating polygonal domains for @xmath6 , which converge to the desired solution .    as an application of the construction",
    ", we will derive a unifying proof of the two most important results on the challenging chavel s conjecture on the domain monotonicity neumann heat kernel ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which also gives a possible new line of approach for this conjecture ( note that by the results in @xcite , chavel s conjecture does not hold in its full generality , but the additional hypotheses under which this conjecture holds are not known at the present moment ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ mirror coupling of rbm ] we briefly describe the construction of burdzy et .",
    "al . of the mirror coupling in a smooth bounded domain domain @xmath0 .    in section [ extensions of mirror coupling ] , in theorem [ main theorem ] , we give the main result which shows that the mirror coupling can be extended to the case when @xmath8 are smooth bounded domains in @xmath9 and @xmath6 is convex ( some extensions of the theorem are presented in section [ extensions and applications ] ) .    before proceeding with the proof of theorem , in remark [ reduction to the case d_1=r ]",
    "we show that the proof of the theorem can be reduced to the case when @xmath10 .",
    "next , in section [ 1-dimensional case ] , we show that in the case @xmath11 the solution is essentially given by tanaka s formula ( remark [ remark on tanaka formula ] ) , and then we give the proof of the main theorem in the @xmath12-dimensional case ( proposition [ prop 1-dim case ] ) .    in section [ case of polygonal domains ] , we first prove the existence of the mirror coupling in the case when @xmath6 is a half - space in @xmath13 and @xmath10 ( lemma [ lemma for a half - space ] ) , and then we use this result in order to prove the existence of the mirror coupling in the case when @xmath6 is a convex polygonal domain in @xmath9 and @xmath14 ( theorem [ coupling in polygonal domains ] )",
    ". some of the properties of coupling , essential for the extension to the general case are detailed in proposition [ properties of mirror coupling in polygonal domains ] .    in section [ the proof of the main theorem ]",
    "we give the proof of the main theorem [ main theorem ] .",
    "the idea of the proof is to construct a sequence @xmath15 of mirror couplings in @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a sequence of convex polygonal domains in @xmath18 , and to use the properties of the mirror couplings in polygonal domains ( proposition [ properties of mirror coupling in polygonal domains ] ) in order to show that the sequence @xmath19 converges to a process @xmath20 , which gives the desired solution to the problem .",
    "the last section of the paper ( section [ extensions and applications ] ) is devoted to discussing the applications and the extensions of the mirror coupling constructed in theorem [ main theorem ] .",
    "first , in theorem theorem on chavel s conjecture we use the mirror coupling in order to give a simple , unifying proof of the results of i. chavel and w. s. kendall on the domain monotonicity of the neumann heat kernel ( chavel s conjecture chavel s conjecture ) .",
    "the proof is probabilistic in spirit , relying on the geometric properties of the mirror coupling .    in remark [ possible extensions of chavel ]",
    ", we discuss the equivalent analytic counterpart of the proof theorem [ theorem on chavel s conjecture ] , which might give a possible new line of approach for extending chavel s conjecture to other classes of domains .    without giving all the technical details",
    ", we discuss the extension of the mirror coupling to other classes of domains ( smooth bounded domains @xmath21 with non - tangential boundaries , such that @xmath22 is a convex domain ) .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion on the ( non ) uniqueness of the mirror coupling .",
    "it is shown here that the lack of uniqueness is due to the fact that after coupling , the processes might decouple , not only on the boundary of the domain , but even when they are inside of it .",
    "the two basic solutions give rise to the _ sticky _ , respectively _ non - sticky _ mirror couplings , and there is a whole range of intermediate possibilities .",
    "the stickiness refers to the fact that after coupling the processes stick  to each other as long as possible ( this is the coupling constructed in theorem [ main theorem ] ) hence the name sticky  mirror coupling , or they can split apart immediately after coupling , in the case of non - sticky  mirror coupling , the general case ( _ weak / mild _ mirror couplings ) being a mixture of these two basic behaviors .",
    "we developed the extension of the mirror coupling having in mind the application to chavel s conjecture , for which the sticky mirror coupling is the right  tool , but perhaps the other mirror couplings ( the non - sticky and the mild mirror couplings ) might prove useful in other applications .",

    "the solution of ( [ 4 ] ) is not pathwise unique .",
    "this is due to the fact that the stochastic differential equation has a singularity at the origin ( i.e. at times when the coupling occurs ) ; the general mirror coupling can be thought as depending on a parameter which is a measure of the stickiness of the coupling : once the processes @xmath29 and @xmath85 have coupled , they can either move together until one of them hits the boundary ( _ sticky _ mirror coupling - this is in fact the solution constructed in the above theorem ) , or they can immediately split after coupling ( non - sticky mirror coupling ) , and there is a whole range of intermediate possibilities ( see the discussion at the end of section extensions and applications ) .    as an application , in section [ extensions and applications ]",

    "consider a mirror coupling @xmath450 of reflecting brownian motions in @xmath451 starting at @xmath452 .",

    "[ possible extensions of chavel]we also note that the above proof uses only geometric considerations on the relative position of the reflecting brownian motions coupled by mirror coupling . analytically , the above proof reduces to showing that @xmath467 for all @xmath468 , where @xmath179 is the solution of the following stochastic differential equation@xmath469where @xmath470 is @xmath12-dimensional brownian motion",

    "however , although the technical details can be considerably longer , it is possible to construct the mirror coupling in a more general setup .",
    "for example , in the case when @xmath64 and @xmath6 are disjoint domains , none of the difficulties encountered in the construction of the mirror coupling occur ( the possibility of coupling / decoupling ) , so the constructions extends immediately to this case .",
    "the two key ingredients in our construction of the mirror coupling were the hypothesis @xmath67 ( needed in order to reduce by a localization argument the construction to the case @xmath475 and the hypothesis on the convexity of the inner domain @xmath6 ( which allowed us to construct a solution of the equation of the mirror coupling in the case @xmath10 ) .",
    "replacing the first hypothesis by the condition that the boundaries @xmath476 and @xmath253 are not tangential ( needed for the localization of the construction of the mirror coupling ) and the second one by condition that @xmath7 is a convex domain , the arguments in the present construction can be modified in order to give rise to a mirror coupling of reflecting brownian motion in @xmath451 .     for the mirror coupling : @xmath477 have non - tangential boundaries and @xmath7 is a convex domain . ]    we conclude with some remarks on the non - uniqueness of the mirror coupling in general domains . to simplify the ideas , we will restrict to the @xmath12-dimensional case when @xmath478 .",

    "in fact , more can be said about the solutions of ( [ degenerate sde ] ) in this case .",
    "it is immediate that both @xmath492 and @xmath493 are solutions to [ degenerate sde ] , and it can be shown that an arbitrary solution can be obtained from @xmath48 by delaying it when it reaches the origin ( sticky brownian motion with sticky point the origin ) .    therefore , until the hitting time @xmath494 of the boundary , we obtain as solutions @xmath495and @xmath496and an intermediate range of solutions , which agree with ( [ sol1 ] ) for some time , then switch to ( [ sol2 ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "correspondingly , this gives rise to mirror couplings of reflecting brownian motions for which the solutions stick to each other after they have coupled ( as in ( [ sol1 ] ) ) , or they immediately split apart after coupling ( as in ( [ sol2 ] ) ) , and there is a whole range of intermediate possibilities .",
    "the first case can be referred to as _ sticky _ mirror coupling , the second as _ non - sticky _ mirror coupling , and the intermediate possibilities as _ weak / mild sticky _ mirror coupling .",
    "the same situation occurs in the general setup in @xmath9 , and it is the cause of lack uniqueness of the stochastic differential equations which define the mirror coupling . in the present paper we detailed the construction of the sticky mirror coupling , which we considered to be the most interesting , both from the point of view of constructions and of the applications ,",
