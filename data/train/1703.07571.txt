    "proper understanding of the dis(deep inelastic scattering ) structure of nucleon and associated sum rules is expected to offer an important opportunity to investigate quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) as a theory of strong interaction and hence these are regarded as the objects of intensive investigation both theoretically and experimentally in recent years(see for example @xcite and references therein ) . with the recent developments of dedicated experimental facilities significant progresses have been observed in the field of experimental investigation of structure functions .",
    "simultaneously , in this regard , tremendous progress is observed in the field of theoretical investigation with a variety of theoretical approaches .",
    "quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) is one of the most important theoretical approaches in order to account for the strong interaction processes observed at high energy particle colliders .",
    "however , the predictive power of qcd is limited .",
    "qcd is successful in describing @xmath4 dependency of the structure functions in accord with dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) evolution equations@xcite in the perturbative regime i.e. , within the bjorken limit ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 fixed and not too small )",
    ". however the most important region in dis , which has attracted much interest recently is the small-@xmath6 region , lies between the interface of bjorken limit and the regge limit .",
    "the dglap equation is a renormalisation group equation for the quarks and gluon inside hadron .",
    "it is one of the fundamental equations of perturbative quantum chromodynamics(pqcd ) , being central to all theoretical predictions for lepton - hadron colliders .",
    "solutions of dglap equations give the @xmath4 evolution of both the parton distribution functions as well as various structure functions .",
    "although qcd predicts the @xmath4 dependence of structure functions in accord with the dglap equations but they have limitations on absolute prediction of structure functions .",
    "dglap equations can not predict the initial values from which the evolution starts , they can only predict the evolution of structure functions with @xmath4 , once an initial distribution is given .",
    "further , due to its complicated mathematical structure , an exact analytic determination of the structure functions is currently out of reach and one needs to apply approximated methods to arrive on predictions from the dglap equation .",
    "accordingly several approximate numerical as well as semi - analytical methods for the solution of dglap equation have been discussed considerably over the past years ( see@xcite and references therein ) .    in our previous paper ref .",
    "@xcite , the small-@xmath6 behaviour of @xmath0 structure function and the gls sum rule was obtained by means of solving the dglap evolution equation using a @xmath4 dependent regge behaved ansatz as initial input with pqcd corrections upto next - next - to - leading order(nnlo ) . in accord with ref.@xcite",
    "the solutions , governing the small-@xmath6 behaviour of @xmath0 structure function in lo , nlo and nnlo are given by ,    @xmath7.\\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt)},\\label{sflo}\\ ] ]    @xmath8\\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt)},\\label{sfnlo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath9\\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt)}.\\label{sfnnlo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively , where the structure function @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 for nothing but simplicity , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the qcd cut off parameter . here",

    "considering above relations for the small-@xmath6 behaviour of @xmath0 structure function we obtained the gls integral with lo , nlo and nnlo corrections as    @xmath24 . \\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt)},\\label{srlo }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath25\\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt)}\\label{srnlo }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath26\\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt)}\\label{srnnlo }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively and they were also observed to be compatible with the ccfr@xcite experimental data and ks @xcite analysis .    detailed phenomenological analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite revealed that higher order pqcd corrections have a significant contribution towards the precise predictions of the structure functions as well as the sum rules .",
    "however recent analysis indicates that precise prediction of structure functions demand to incorporate several non - perturbative effects , in addition to pqcd corrections .",
    "there are several non - perturbative effects such as nuclear effects , higher twist effects , target mass corrections(tmc ) etc .",
    ", to be incorporated into the joint qcd analysis of dis structure functions and sum rules .",
    "however in accord with @xcite the contribution due to tmc within the region of our consideration is neglected . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of the nnlo results of @xmath0 structure function and the gls sum rules taking into account the nuclear effects and higher twist corrections .",
    "the fact that the structure functions of bound and free nucleons are not equal was discovered in a deep inelastic muon experiment carried out by the european muon collaboration at cern in 1982@xcite .",
    "since then the nuclear effect has been actively investigated with ever more sophisticated and ingenious deep inelastic scattering experiment with charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "available experimental information on nuclear structure functions are mainly from charged - lepton dis experiments performed at cern , slac , desy , fnal and at jlab . in addition , data from the drell  yan reaction of protons off nuclear targets are also available @xcite .",
    "the experiments usually measures the ratio @xmath27 of the structure function @xmath28 of a complex nucleus to deuterium .",
    "the studies on the behaviour of the ratio @xmath27 as a function of @xmath6 for a given fixed @xmath4 reflects four distinct region of characteristic nuclear effects : shadowing region(@xmath29 ) , anti - shadowing region(@xmath30 ) , emc region ( @xmath31 ) and fermi motion region(@xmath32 ) .",
    "in addition to the charged - lepton dis , neutrino dis have also been a significant process for investigating the structures of hadrons and nuclei(see @xcite and their references ) .",
    "many @xmath33-dis experimental programmes , such as bebc@xcite , cdhs@xcite , e545@xcite , and , etc.,were carried out in order to have proper information about structure of nucleon , nuclear effect(emc ) , mixing angle of weak interaction , etc . but none of them were able to confirm the emc effect due to the presence of statistical uncertainties with the measurements .",
    "however it is expected that the measurements of differential cross - sections and structure functions in ccfr@xcite , nutev@xcite , cdhsw@xcite , chorus@xcite and more recently in minerva@xcite , through @xmath33-dis experiments would provide us better understanding about nuclear effect as well as internal structure of nucleon(see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "along with the experimental efforts , several groups have been performed theoretical as well as phenomenological analysis of the nuclear effects in neutrino - nucleus dis . among them",
    "most prominent are the kulagin and petti(kp)@xcite , qiu and vitev(qv)@xcite and hirai , komano and naga(hkn ) groups@xcite , which have predicted the nuclear corrections in the low @xmath6 region .",
    "kulagin and petti s approach is quite different from the above ones in the sense that they try to calculate the nuclear corrections in conventional nuclear models as far as they can , and then they try to attribute remaining factors to off - shell effects of bound nucleons for explaining the data .    for simplicity , let us denote @xmath10 as @xmath11 and with this notation our results , ( [ sfnnlo ] ) which predicts the @xmath0 structure functions for a nucleon(single or free ) in nnlo pqcd corrections can be written as    @xmath34\\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt)}. \\label{8ch1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however in predicting the free nucleon structure functions , we need to consider the input point @xmath35 , a free nucleon structure function at @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in our previous analysis",
    "performed in ref.@xcite , the points were taken from the available experimental data .",
    "it is known that the experimental data for nucleon structure functions are extracted from nuclear targets and hence they are with several nuclear effects .",
    "thus the experimental input points , we considered in our previous analysis are nothing but nuclear structure function @xmath38 , which in turn leads to inaccuracy in predicting free nucleon structure function",
    ". therefore accurate prediction of free nucleon structure function requires a nuclear effect free input point .",
    "the experimental results are the structure functions for bound nucleon @xmath39 which is related to the free nucleon structure function as    @xmath40    here @xmath39 represents the nuclear structure function per nucleon and @xmath41 , the free nucleon structure function . at @xmath36 and @xmath37 , if we consider the value of the nuclear correction factor to be @xmath42 , the input point in ( [ 8ch1 ] ) can be replaced with @xmath43 and provides    @xmath44\\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt)}. \\label{ne3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    above expression is capable of predicting the free nucleon structure function through the experimental data @xmath38 along with the correction factor @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , due to the unavailability of free nucleon structure function data , direct phenomenological analysis of ( [ ne3 ] ) is not possible . in order to perform phenomenological analysis of our results with the experimental data either we need to remove nuclear effects from the data points or include the corresponding effects to our results of free nucleon . here",
    "we have considered the later one , i.e. , we have incorporated the nuclear correction factor @xmath46 with our calculations as    @xmath47\\bigg(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\bigg)^{(1-bt ) } , \\label{ne4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to describe properly the experimental results .    in this paper",
    "we have utilised the results for the nuclear correction factor @xmath46 predicted in kp@xcite . incorporating the corresponding corrections to our calculations of @xmath11 structure function , we have obtained the nuclear structure function @xmath48 and depicted them in fig .",
    "[ nef3ns ] .",
    "here we have shown only the modification of our nnlo results in comparison with ccfr , nutev , chorus and cdhsw experimental data .",
    "we observe that our results for free nucleon structure functions , along with nuclear effect predicted by kp provides a well description of available experimental data for nuclear structure functions .",
    "analogous to the structure functions , experimental determination of the dis sum rules consists of considerable nuclear effects . as dis sum rules are associated with the underlying symmetry as well as conservation laws of interactions , they provide strong normalization constraints on the structure functions .",
    "therefore the sum rules are expected to provide an important bridge between different nuclear effects . in this section",
    "we briefly discuss the nuclear effects in gls sum rule based on several earlier analysis .",
    "we then incorporate possible nuclear corrections to our results eq .",
    "( [ srnnlo ] ) for gls sum rule , obtained in the previous paper@xcite and perform phenomenological analysis in comparison with the experimental measurements .",
    "experimental measurements of gls sum rule was performed by ccfr and the results were extracted from @xmath49 target . in order to compare our results for gls sum rule obtained in @xcite , we refer the nuclear corrections estimated in @xcite .",
    "the detailed investigation on the nuclear corrections to gls sum rule was performed in ref .",
    "they explicitly separated the nuclear corrections to the gls integral as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 refers to the gls integral for nucleon . in accord with their predictions , the nuclear corrections to the gls sum rule",
    "cancel out as @xmath52 in the leading order , which is due to the baryon charge conservation .",
    "they have also calculated the gls integral , @xmath53 for different nuclear targets . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they obtained the corrections for iron and deuteron nuclei as @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite they have nicely presented their result in fig .",
    "10 . from fig .",
    "10 we observe that the nuclear correction @xmath56 decreases progressively by increasing @xmath4 .    the gls sum rule for nuclei can be expressed as    @xmath57    where the first term on the right hand side of above equation represents the gls sum rule for free nucleon and the second term for the nuclear correction . using the nnlo pqcd corrected expression ( [ srnnlo ] ) as @xmath58 we get    @xmath59+\\delta s_{gls}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now incorporating the kp@xcite prediction @xmath54 , for the nuclear correction term , we have calculated @xmath60 and depicted the results in fig .",
    "[ neglsq ] , in comparison with ccfr measurements of gls sum rule with @xmath49 as the target .",
    "in addition , we have plotted our nnlo results and the results of ks@xcite prediction . from the figure",
    "we see that the our nnlo expression for glssr along with necessary nuclear correction has the capability of describing the experimental data of glssr for nuclei .",
    "the behaviour of the deep inelastic structure functions can be analyzed with the perturbative qcd .",
    "a method used for this analysis is the operator product expansion method(ope)@xcite .",
    "the ope is successful in describing the contributions from different quark - gluon operators to hadronic tensor and helps in ordering them according to their twist . in accord with ope ,",
    "the dis structure functions and sum rules consist of two parts , the leading twist(lt ) and the higher twist(ht ) contributions :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 labels the type of the structure function ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the leading twist term is associated with the single particle properties of quarks and gluons inside the nucleon and is responsible for the scaling of dis structure function via perturbative qcd @xmath64 corrections .",
    "the higher twist terms reflect instead the strength of multi - parton interactions ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "since such interactions spoil factorization one has to consider their impact on the parton distribution functions extracted in the analysis of low-@xmath4 data . because of the non - perturbative origin it is difficult to quantify the magnitude and shape of the higher twist terms from first principles and current models can only provide a qualitative description for such contributions , which must then be determined phenomenologically from data .",
    "the higher twist terms are governed by the terms contributing at different orders of @xmath67 :    @xmath68    the leading term in this expansion is known as twist - two , the sub - leading ones twist - three , etcetera .",
    "the higher twist terms are suppressed by terms of order @xmath67 , @xmath69 ... , respectively .",
    "the currently available experimental measurements of deep inelastic structure functions covers a wide range of @xmath6 and @xmath4 with ever increasing precision , which lead to an interesting challenge for theoretical physics in describing these data in the low-@xmath4 domain .",
    "pqcd predictions , even with higher order corrections up to nnlo and nnnlo observed to be not sufficient for a precise description of deep inelastic structure function data , which in turn reveals that the discrepancy among data and pqcd predictions are not primarily the sub - leading terms in powers of @xmath70 , but corrections which are proportional to the reciprocal value of the photon virtuality @xmath4 , viz .",
    "higher - twist terms@xcite .",
    "the extraction of higher twist terms from the data is a longstanding problem , as recognized from the very first developments of a pqcd phenomenology @xcite .",
    "existing information about higher twist terms in lepton - nucleon structure functions is scarce and somewhat controversial .",
    "early analysis @xcite suggested a significant ht contribution to the longitudinal structure function @xmath71 . the subsequent studies with both charged leptons @xcite and neutrinos @xcite raised the question of a possible dependence on order of qcd calculation used for the leading twist .",
    "the common wisdom is generally that hts only affect the region of @xmath72 and can be neglected in the extraction of the leading twist .",
    "the higher twist terms are presently poorly known and currently is a subject of both theoretical and phenomenological studies(see @xcite and the references therein )",
    ". a better understanding of ht terms , in particular their role in describing low @xmath4 and high @xmath6 dis data is important and provides valuable information on quark gluon correlations inside the nucleon . the importance of higher twist ( ht ) contribution to structure functions was pointed from the very beginning of qcd in comparison with experimental data@xcite on structure functions .",
    "several reports are available on the determination of the higher twist contributions in the electron - dis structure functions @xmath73(see",
    "@xcite for details)as well as neutrino - dis structure function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "further , in general the higher twist corrections are also present in the case of polarized deeply inelastic scattering . but in this regard",
    "as the polarized structure functions are predicted in terms of an asymmetry , the effect of higher twist corrections in the denominator function needs to be known accurately .",
    "however , in @xcite no significant higher twist contributions were found . on the other hand some authors predicted (",
    "see for example ref.@xcite ) existence of higher twist contributions in the low @xmath6 region , which is also the region of very low values of @xmath4 .    the usual approach in analyses whose main aim is the extraction of leading twist pdfs is either to parametrize the higher twist contributions by a phenomenological form and fit the parameters to the experimental data@xcite , or to extract the @xmath4 dependence by fitting it in individual bins in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "such an approach effectively includes contributions from multiparton correlations ( the true higher twist contributions ) along with other power corrections that are not yet part of the theoretical treatment of dis at low @xmath4 .",
    "these include @xmath74 contributions such as jet mass corrections @xcite and soft gluon resummation @xcite , as well as contributions which are of higher order in @xmath70 but whose logarithmic @xmath4 behavior mimics terms @xmath75 at low virtuality@xcite .    in the following subsections we present a simple model in order to extract the higher twist contribution to @xmath0 structure function and gls sum rule , along with comment on the phenomenological implications of our results .",
    "in order to estimate the higher twist contribution to the @xmath0 structure function , we have performed an analysis based on a simple model . here",
    "the first higher twist term is extracted and to do so we have parameterised the non - singlet structure functions as    @xmath76    here leading twist(lt ) term corresponds to the pqcd contribution to structure functions and the constants @xmath77 ( one per @xmath6 - bin ) parameterize the @xmath6 dependence of higher twist contributions . for the leading twist term , we have utilised the results for the non - singlet structure functions obtained in our previous paper @xcite . incorporating our results for non - singlet structure functions in nnlo as the lt terms we have extracted the difference , @xmath78 from their corresponding experimental data and",
    "then fitted with @xmath79 . from the best fitting values",
    ", we have determined the higher twist contribution terms @xmath80 per @xmath6-bin . in this analysis",
    "we have performed our fitting analysis within the kinematical region @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    incorporating the nnlo result ( [ sfnnlo ] ) as the lt term",
    ", we have fitted the parametrization ( [ eq:9chf3 ] ) with the ccfr , nutev , chorus and cdhsw data for the @xmath6-bins @xmath83 .",
    "best fitted values of @xmath84 at different values of @xmath6 are presented in table [ tab:9chhtf3ns ] along with the @xmath85 value .",
    ".higher twist corrections to @xmath0 structure function at nnlo .",
