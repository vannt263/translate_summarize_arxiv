    "optical antennas or nanoantennas have been the focus of research efforts due to their intriguing applications in wireless nano - links @xcite , photodetection @xcite , photo emission @xcite , and nonlinear plasmonics @xcite , to name a few .",
    "antennas play a vital role as the mediator between free space propagation and localized energy in communication systems @xcite .",
    "antennas may offer less loss and improved performance as compared to their plasmonic waveguide interconnect counterparts @xcite , specifically in optical wireless nano - links with long propagation distances of more than several wavelengths .",
    "however , modifications to the conventional antenna theory and design techniques are needed in the optical frequencies due to the changes in the properties of metals @xcite .",
    "designing individual antennas to resonate at optical frequencies is not the only problem to be solved .",
    "impedance matched integration of antennas with waveguides , efficient energy extraction from ( or coupling to ) the antennas , and controlling the directivity of the antennas are other challenges that need to be tackled @xcite . recently , a widely used rf horn antenna @xcite design has been extended to operate at the optical frequency regime .",
    "the horn geometry offers an inherently waveguide integrated design , a high directivity , and a large efficiency @xcite .",
    "ramaccia et al .",
    "first studied horn nanoantennas with a gradual exponentially tapered structure where metal - insulator - metal waveguides with cylindrical metallic pillars were incorporated @xcite .",
    "a similar structure was adopted by yang et al .",
    "@xcite where they designed a broadband and highly directive e - plane horn @xcite nanoantenna with straight flares fully incorporated in a homogeneous medium . in @xcite ,",
    "yang et al .  extended the same horn antenna concept , where a plasmonic channel waveguide , along with the flared section , was carved in a silver film .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite presented a systematic study of the horn nanoantenna for different flare parameters , where the antennas were embedded in a homogeneous medium , and radiated in end - fire direction@xcite for wireless nano - link applications .    on the other hand , when a nanoantenna is placed at the interface between two different media with different refractive indices",
    ", it radiates a significant amount of power into the medium with the higher index @xcite .",
    "if horn nanoantennas presented in @xcite , which were designed for end - fire radiation , are placed at the interface of two heterogeneous media , they will radiate mostly into the substrate . as a result ,",
    "only a fraction of the total power can be coupled or extracted from the end - fire direction , as the antenna radiation will be directed elsewhere .",
    "thus , there is a need to engineer the radiation of these nanoantennas , so that they can radiate in any given direction , for applications in wireless nano - links @xcite , and laser detection and ranging @xcite .",
    "previously , plasmonic substrates ( i.e.  metallic ground - planes ) were used to manipulate the nanoantennas radiation pattern @xcite .",
    "if a reflector ground plane is employed , directly emitted light from the nanoantenna and the reflected light from the ground plane can interfere with different phases based on the thickness and type of the substrate material , enabling one to control and engineer the far - field radiation pattern @xcite . in @xcite , ghadarghadr et al .",
    "reported that the dipole nanoantenna far - field radiation can be engineered by changing the distance between the dipole and the reflecting surface , and showed beam steering can be achieved in any arbitrary direction , ranging from end - fire to broadside .",
    "similarly , reflector ground planes were also used by @xcite in order to direct the scattered radiation from nanoparticles or dipole nanoantennas out of the substrate plane .    in this paper , we analyze and extend the plasmonic horn antenna design in @xcite to the case where the antenna is at the interface of air and a glass substrate with or without a metal mirror at its back .",
    "analysis of the proposed design shows that beam steering can be achieved by changing the thickness of the substrate . in order to minimize the reflection from the antenna into the waveguide we use the impedance matching technique in @xcite .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sec2 ] , we introduce the horn nanoantenna .",
    "section [ sec : sec3 ] gives an in - depth analysis of the horn nanoantenna on an infinitely thick as well as on a finite thickness , metal - backed substrate , along with the illustration of impedance matching technique .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "the antenna structure with the ground plane and impedance matching section is shown in fig .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows top view of the antenna ( xy - plane ) , and fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows side view of the antenna ( xz - plane ) .",
    "the horn antenna , along with the waveguide , is placed at the interface between air ( n=1 ) and glass ( n=1.44 ) .",
    "the waveguide is in the form of a two - wire transmission line ( twtl ) with fixed dimensions @xmath1 given by @xmath2 nm , respectively , while the gap @xmath3 between these two wires is equal to 30 nm .",
    "the horn length @xmath4 is 650 nm , the opening angle @xmath5 equal to 20@xmath6 , and width of the horn strip @xmath7 equal to 300 nm .",
    "it should be noted that lengths @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 make a total length @xmath11 , where @xmath8 is position of the impedance matching ( i m ) section from flare and twtl interface , and @xmath9 is length of the i m section .",
    "the substrate has a finite thickness @xmath12 in the case of a metal - backed antenna .",
    "the nanoantenna was simulated and analyzed in comsol multiphysics .",
    "the whole structure was excited by the fundamental mode that is supported by the twtl .",
    "a rectangular _ numeric port _ was defined at the end cross - section of the twtl , and _ boundary mode analysis _ was used to calculate the mode at the specified port .",
    "the _ boundary mode analysis _ performs an eigenfunction study to find the desired mode ( fundamental mode in this case ) supported by the twtl , and its associated propagation constant .",
    "consequently , the same mode , with input power ( @xmath13 ) was fed to the antenna system .",
    "the whole structure was bounded by a box which served for the purpose of calculating the far - field pattern of the antenna , and a pml layer of finite thickness was assigned at each face of the bounding box .",
    "permittivities for a range of wavelengths of the silver @xmath14 metal were obtained by interpolating the data from @xcite .",
    "in radio frequency ( rf ) and microwave engineering , an antenna s performance is evaluated by its near - field electric field ( e - field ) intensity , directivity , and how well the antenna is matched to the connecting waveguide by measuring the reflection coefficient @xmath15 .",
    "directivity is defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath5 and @xmath17 are elevation and azimuth angle , respectively , @xmath18 is the angular power density , and @xmath19 is total radiated power .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the results for the nanoantenna where the substrate is an infinitely thick glass .",

    "[ fig2](b ) , one can observe that most of the radiation is directed into the substrate .",
    "directivity of horn antennas is given in terms of e - plane and h - plane pattern @xcite .",
    "e - plane is defined as the plane in which the primary e - field of the electromagnetic wave radiated by an antenna lies , which in our case is xy - plane , and h - plane is defined as the plane in which the magnetic field ( h - field ) lies , which is xz - plane in this case .",
    "figure  [ fig2](c ) shows the far - field h - plane directivity pattern of the antenna which has a maximum value of 14.5 at @xmath21 .",
    "the amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath15 and the radiation efficiency @xmath19/@xmath22 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) as function of wavelength . at the central wavelength of 1550 nm ,",
    "@xmath15 ( black solid line ) is less than 0.09 ( in linear scale ) meaning that @xmath23 power is delivered to the nanoantenna . during the calculation of the radiation efficiency ,",
    "@xmath22 is calculated as @xmath24 @xcite , where @xmath25 is the waveguide s propagation length , and @xmath11 is length of the twtl .",
    "the total radiation efficiency is around 0.61 , at 1550 nm , while the efficiency in substrate is greater than efficiency in air , which also confirms that most of the power is radiated into the substrate .",

    "therefore , only a fraction of the total power can be extracted from the plane parallel to the nanoantenna , as required in the case of a nano - link @xcite . in this section",
    "we investigate the effects of a reflective ground plane beneath the substrate .",
    "we examine the radiation properties by changing the thickness @xmath12 of the substrate .",
