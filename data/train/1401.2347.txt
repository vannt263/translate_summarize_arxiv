    "+ ii ) the massive dense cores reported toward this irdc @xcite are preferentially found toward the intersecting positions between filaments 1 and 3 , which suggests that these filaments may be interacting .",
    "+ iii ) a global , relatively smooth velocity gradient of @xmath20.4 - 0.8@xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath4@xmath3pc@xmath4 is measured from north to south in this irdc .",
    "several possible scenarios , including rotation , global gas accretion along the filaments , global gravitational collapse , and unresolved sub - filamentary structures , are proposed to explain this velocity gradient .",
    "+ iv ) the linewidths of the molecular gas in the three filaments clearly exceed the thermal contribution , indicating that the gas motions are supersonic ( @xmath22 - 3 in sonic mach number ) .",
    "the @xmath0co @xmath17=2@xmath181 linewidths get broader in the outer regions of the irdc .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that reported toward the low - mass star - forming b5 core @xcite .",
    "+ v ) the average h@xmath6 densities in the filaments are @xmath25000 - 7000@xmath3@xmath7 , with filament 1 being less dense and less massive than filaments 2 and 3 .",
    "this would explain the systematic velocity red - shift observed for the high - density gas with respect to the low - density gas in the irdc envelope reported in @xcite .",
    "+ vi ) the co depletion derived from the high - j c@xmath1o lines toward g035.39 - 00.33 are @xmath8@xmath25 - 12 , factors of 2 - 3 larger than those previously measured from lower - density c@xmath1o lines @xcite . +",
