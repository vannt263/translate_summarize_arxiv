    "in discussing collective excitations of quantum degenerate gases , there arises a distinction between hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes .",
    "let @xmath0 be a frequency of a collective mode and @xmath1 be a mean - collision time .",
    "the hydrodynamic regime is characterized by @xmath2 , while the collisionless regime is characterized by @xmath3 .",
    "the present paper is devoted to detail analyses of collective excitations in both limiting regimes and in the crossover regime .",
    "we deal with a sound propagation in a population balanced normal fermi gas .",
    "in general , the viscosity calculated in the hydrodynamic regime diverges at the absolute zero temperature ( @xmath4 ) , and hence it was considered that sound could not propagate at @xmath5 . in 1957 , using the fermi liquid theory  @xcite , landau predicted that a sound propagation could occur in liquid @xmath6he even at very low temperatures owing to the mean - field interaction  @xcite .",
    "this new type of sound was called zero sound , which differs from first sound propagating because of a small dissipation achieved by local equilibrium .",
    "khalatnikov and abrikosov conducted detail calculations of the dispersion relation and derived the sound attenuation coefficient of the zero and first sound modes  @xcite .",
    "_ confirmed the existence of zero sound in the liquid @xmath6he  @xcite .",
    "they also observed a crossover between the zero and first sound modes , and measured temperature dependence of the sound velocity and of the sound attenuation coefficient . the theoretical prediction based on the landau s fermi liquid theory  @xcite agreed with the experimental data .",
    "until now , investigations of liquid @xmath6he have been conducted in detail , and the results are summarized in many text books  @xcite .",
    "the landau s fermi liquid theory is also summarized in standard textbooks  @xcite .    with the realization of the bose - einstein condensate as a turning point  @xcite",
    ", vigorous studies of ultracold atomic gases have been conducted .",
    "ultracold atomic gases have flexibilities such as controllability of an interaction parameter using the feshbach resonance .",
    "these systems open new windows to investigate phenomena that were difficult and impossible to study in the liquid helium and superconductors .    as mentioned below , a number of studies on the collective modes have been also reported in ultracold fermi gases .",
    "dipole oscillations were studied in collisionless and collisional regimes in two component @xmath7k gases  @xcite .",
    "experiments of the collective excitation in the bcs - bec crossover regime have been performed using @xmath8li gases  @xcite . in particular , the reference  @xcite reported the sound velocity in the bcs - bec crossover regime .",
    "collective excitations in fermi gases have been also investigated theoretically .",
    "the dipole mode  @xcite and the quadrupole mode  @xcite were analyzed making use of the moment method .",
    "zero sound with arbitrary spin was investigated  @xcite .",
    "bruun _ et .",
    "al . _ studied collective modes in trapped gases extensively and intensively  @xcite .",
    "tosi s group studied collective modes by solving the boltzmann equation numerically  @xcite .",
    "they studied the dipole mode of two component trapped gases as a function of a collision rate in some situations  @xcite , and the crossover between zero and first sound modes in the cigar - shaped trap  @xcite .",
    "recently , collective excitations in the unitarity limit were studied  @xcite .    as noted earlier , after a publication of the path - breaking work by landau  @xcite , a classic paper by khalatnikov and abrikosov studied the crossover between zero sound and first sound  @xcite .",
    "they treated a mean - collision time as temperature - dependent , but approximated other quantities by those at @xmath4 .",
    "when the system is in the collisional regime at finite temperatures , a sound velocity within this analysis reaches that of first sound evaluated at @xmath4 .",
    "this simple approximation is appropriate as long as we restrict discussion to the landau s fermi liquid theory , since this theory focuses on quasiparticles at sufficiently low temperatures . in the experiments in liquid @xmath6he",
    "@xcite , however , the temperature dependence of first sound velocity has been observed , although it was small . in usual atomic gases ,",
    "furthermore , first sound has a significant temperature dependence , and hence the simple treatment mentioned above is invalid at high temperatures .",
    "it is therefore necessary to discuss the crossover between the zero and first sound modes with a more efficient treatment valid at wide range of temperatures .",
    "brooker and sykes attempted to analyze the general solution of the linearized boltzmann equation to investigate the crossover of sound propagation  @xcite .",
    "they expanded a deviation from local equilibrium in terms of spherical harmonic functions , and introduced different relaxation times for different spherical harmonics .",
    "they , however , used an approximation only appropriate in the low temperature regime , and hence the analysis was not appropriate at high temperatures .",
    "they , furthermore , could not obtain the explicit solution because of the computational difficulty at that time , although they gave an equation to be solved .",
    "although the physics on the crossover between the zero and first sound modes has been understood to some extent , some issues shown above still remain . with the developments of recent experimental techniques in ultracold atomic gases and of theoretical methods ,",
    "it is meaningful to revisit the study of sound mode in fermi systems with a modern approach . in the present paper , we investigate the crossover between zero sound and first sound over wide parameter ranges with a single theoretical framework . for this purpose , we analyze the general solution of the linearized boltzmann equation using the moment method .",
    "the moment method is suitable for describing the crossover of collective excitations between collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes . so far in cold atomic gases ,",
    "the moment method has been used to study characteristic collective excitations in trapped systems , such as monopole , dipole , quadrupole and scissors modes  @xcite . with a use of same technique , collective modes in atomic gases with internal degrees of freedom",
    "were also studied  @xcite .",
    "the moment equation for the uniform system , however , has not been solved to study sound modes in quantum many - body systems .",
    "this is one of the new points in the present paper .    in the landau",
    "s fermi liquid theory , central players are quasiparticle , and hence theoretical studies have been done in the very low temperature regime .",
    "those studies are based on the landau boltzmann equation for quasiparticles . in dilute quantum gases ,",
    "on the other hand , real atoms are central players .",
    "these systems are described by the boltzmann equation for real particles . although the boltzmann equation has the same form as the landau boltzmann equation , this equation is applicable up to the high - temperature maxwell - boltzmann gas regime .",
    "studies of sound mode in ultracold atomic gases thus need a single theory which can be applied up to high temperatures .",
    "the present study can solve those issues .",
    "the contents of the present paper are summarized as follows : ( a ) the spectrum of the sound mode obtained from the general solution shows the crossover between zero sound and first sound . in collisionless and collisional regimes , the sound velocities reproduce the results calculated in each limiting regime .",
    "this method also offers the frequency of first sound with the temperature dependence .",
    "this result can not be obtained by a standard approach such as given in ref .",
    "( b ) the results of the moment method include a thermal diffusion mode .",
    "( c ) the moment method reproduces not only a collective mode of the sound propagation , but also the particle - hole continuum .",
    "( d ) in a weak coupling case , the crossover between zero sound and first sound has a different character from the crossover in a strong coupling case .",
