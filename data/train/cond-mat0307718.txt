    "we have recently studied an externally driven , finite temperature bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) described by the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdhfb ) equations  @xcite .",
    "a systematic procedure was outlined for solving these equations perturbatively in the applied external field , and position - dependent linear response functions and susceptibilities were calculated .    in this paper",
    "we extend this formalism to calculate the second order response function for the condensate , non - condensate density and non - condensate correlation .",
    "the linear response provides an adequate description of the system only for weak external perturbations .",
    "otherwise , nonlinear effects contained in the higher order terms in the perturbation series may not be ignored .",
    "there are strong similarities between nonlinear optics and the dynamics of bec owing to the interatomic interactions in bose condensates .",

    "the tdhfb theory is a self - consistent theory of bec in the collisionless regime that progresses logically from the gross - pitaevskii equation by taking into account higher order correlations of noncondensate operators . although tdhfb neglects higher order correlations included in the various quantum kinetic theories , the tdhfb equations are valid at very low temperatures near zero , even down to the zero temperature limit , and are far simpler than the kinetic equations which can only be solved using approximations such as zng .",
    "another attractive feature of tdhfb from a purely pragmatic point of view is that the fermionic version of the theory has already been well - developed in nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "we therefore work at the tdhfb level in this paper and our approach draws upon the analogy with the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) formalism developed for nonlinear optical response of many electron systems  @xcite .    in section ii",

    "7 shows the corresponding plot at the finite temperature @xmath151 .",
    "the main difference is that there are more peaks appearing around frequency @xmath152 , @xmath153 than at zero temperature .    since the second order susceptibility @xmath154 is by itself a product of several green s functions @xmath155 and linear susceptibilities @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 , several features of figs .",

    "this explains the features around @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "in addition , the linear susceptibility @xmath156 at finite temperature has more peaks around frequencies @xmath161 than at zero temperature , as there are more resonances below the frequency of 1 at finite temperature .",
