    "narrow , low - energy ( @xmath2 kev ) spectral lines in grbs have been reported using the data of several instruments ( e.g. , see review @xcite ) . based on these reports , the batse team expected lines to be easy to find and looked for them manually @xcite .",
    "the reality was different : lines were not obvious in burst spectra . in order to be sure that the manual search had not missed any lines",
    ", we implemented a comprehensive , automatic computer search @xcite .",
    "bursts with at least one spectrum with a normed signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite near 40  kev above 5.0 are searched . for each burst , we form spectra from each individual spectral record , every pair , triple , etc . the spectra so formed overlap in many cases .",
    "once a burst is selected for the search , spectra are searched regardless of the presence of burst flux  low snr spectra serve as controls .",
    "each spectrum is fit with a continuum model and then a series of fits are made adding narrow lines at a closely spaced grid of line centroids extending to 100 kev .",
    "line candidates are identified by a @xmath3 change @xmath4 of more than 20 , corresponding to a chance probability in a single spectrum of @xmath5 .",
    "the probability is calculated for two line parameters , intensity and centroid , since the intrinsic width is assumed narrow compared to the detector resolution .",
    "so far , 133,000 spectra formed from 12,000 spectral records from 117 bursts have been searched .",
    "most of these spectra have snr too low to support the detection of a line .",
    "only 16,000 have normed snr @xmath6 5 , which our simulations show is needed to have a reasonable sensitivity to lines similar to those found in the _ ginga _ data @xcite .",
    "the search identified several cases with @xmath4 values exceeding our significance threshold , but which we rejected either because they occur in background intervals or because they become insignificant when a better fit requiring a non - negative flux is made .",
    "these cases were located in spectra of low snr , and because of the large number of low - snr spectra , they are consistent with statistical fluctuations .",
    "several possible candidates with angles between the burst direction and detector normal exceeding @xmath7 are inconsistent with the data of other detectors .",
    "we believe these cases to be due to inadequacies in the detector model and we have set them aside .",
    "after these exclusions , our candidate list has 12 members with @xmath4 values ranging from the threshold of 20 to 31.8 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the normed snrs of the spectra in which these candidates are most significant range from 2.1 to 18.4 , with 10 normed snr values exceeding 5 .",
    "these snr values are reasonable for real features .",
    "the number of independent trials is a nebulous concept . while there are roughly 16,000 spectra sufficiently bright for there to be a high probability of detecting a real line , many of these spectra overlap , e.g. , starting a few records earlier or later , or differing in length by a few records .",
    "consequently the number of bright , independent spectra is one or more orders of magnitude below 16,000 . the number of independent energy resolution elements averages about 5 per spectrum .",
    "we estimate that the ensemble chance probability of the most - significant candidate is below @xmath9 , and probably much lower than this value .",
    "we therefore believe that few , if any , of these candidates are statistical fluctuations . of the 12 candidates , in all but one",
    "the best line fit is an emission feature with a centroid near 40  kev .",
    "the twelfth candidate is an absorption feature at 60  kev .",
    "typically the lowest energy of the data is about 20 kev , so we are unable to find lines much below 40  kev .",
    "we have previously presented results @xcite for a candidate in grb  940703 ( trigger 3057 ) which was usefully observed by only one batse spectroscopy detector ( sd ) .",
    "observations are useful only from sds in high - gain mode which point to within @xmath7 of the burst . since that time we have searched more bursts and begun more detailed analyses of the nine candidates that were usefully observed by more than one sd .",
    "these multiple - detector cases allow stringent tests of the reality of the candidates .",
    "ideally , the data from another detector will confirm the feature found by the automatic search .",
    "while some features may not be confirmed by another detector due to differing snrs between the detectors or from plausible statistical fluctuations , the data of all detectors must be consistent .",
    "grb 941017 ( trigger 3245 ) was usefully observed by sds 0 and  5 .",
    "the automatic search identified a candidate in the data of sd  0 during the rising portion of the burst ( fig .",
    "a spectrum is not available for sd  5 for the time interval with the best @xmath4 value for sd  0 .",
    "we therefore continued our analysis using spectra from a similar time interval ( 9.728 to 23.936  s ) which is available for both detectors .",
    "the results of fits to this interval are listed in table  1 .",
    "because of the non - optimum time interval , the significance of the feature in the data of sd  0 is reduced .",
    "the line was discovered in the data of sd  0 so we may regard the centroid as a priori determined when we analyze the data of sd  5 .",
    "a one parameter line fit yields a significance for the feature in sd  5 of @xmath10 .",
    "the joint fit ( fig .",
    "2 ) yields a significance of @xmath11 , better than the value obtained with sd  0 alone despite the forced change to the common time interval .",
    "sd  5 provides evidence for the feature independent of the detector in which the feature was found by the automatic search .",
    ".line fits to the common time interval , grb  941017 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to demonstrate the existence of a line , we must show that the data require a line independent of which reasonable continuum model is assumed @xcite .",
    "the above fits were made using the standard ` grb ' continuum function of band . however , if we use an alternative continuum model with a low - energy break _ in addition _ to the standard high - energy break , the significance of the line in sd  0 is reduced to @xmath12 ( @xmath13= 4% ) . while this model still involves a low - energy spectral feature ( fig .",
    "3 ) , it means that for this burst we can not prove that the feature is a line .",
    "since our last report @xcite , we have completed the automatic search for bright bursts through may 1996 .",
    "we have identified 12 line candidates and have begun detailed analysis . because the 12 candidates appear as expected in the small fraction of spectra with high snr , their probability of appearing in the ensemble by chance is low .    for all except one of the 12 candidates ,",
    "the best line fit is an emission line with a centroid near 40  kev .",
    "our simulations show that we have useful sensitivity to _ ginga_-like absorption lines at 40  kev @xcite , so the lack of detections of absorption lines gives a constraint on their frequency .",
    "however , with the small number of bright bursts seen by batse and _ ginga _ , there is no significant discrepancy between the two instruments @xcite .",
    "observations made with multiple detectors have the strong advantage of redundantly verifying the existence of the features .",
    "we have now carefully investigated several candidate features , including some observed with multiple detectors .",
    "so far the evidence appears good for the existence of spectral features , however we do not want to make a blanket statement that batse has observed spectral features until we have carefully examined all 12 candidates .",
    "note that we are stating that the evidence appears good for the existence of _ spectral features .",
    "_ in the cases",
    "examined so far , we have not been able to demonstrate that the spectral features must be narrow lines ",
    "an alternative explanation is possible : a low - energy break in addition to the normal break in the few 100 kev to 1 mev region ."
