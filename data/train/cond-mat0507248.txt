    "josephson first noted that the superconducting tunnel junction can be viewed as a non - linear , non - dissipative , electrodynamic oscillator @xcite . we exploit this non - linearity to produce a new type of high - sensitivity amplifier , the josephson bifurcation amplifier ( jba ) .",
    "no shunt resistors are required in our amplification scheme , and it is thus possible to take advantage of the elastic character of the junction and eliminate on - chip dissipation , thereby minimizing the back - action of the amplifier .",
    "the combination of high - sensitivity and minimal back - action makes the jba well - suited for measurements on quantum systems such as superconducting qubits , and make it a strong candidate for reaching the quantum noise limit .",
    "the operation of the jba is represented schematically in fig .",
    "1 . the central element is a josephson junction , shunted with a lithographic capacitor , whose critical current @xmath0 is modulated by an input signal ( input port ) .",
    "coupling between the junction and the input signal can be achieved through different schemes , examples of which involve placing the jba in a squid loop @xcite or in parallel with a sset @xcite .",
    "the junction is driven with a pure ac signal @xmath1 in the microwave frequency range fed via a transmission line through a circulator ( drive port ) . in the underdamped regime , for certain values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , two possible oscillation states which differ in amplitude and phase ( denoted `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' ) can coexist .",
    "the reflected component of the drive signal , measured through another transmission line connected to the circulator ( output port ) , is a convenient signature of the junction oscillation state . at the bifurcation point where switching between oscillation states occurs",
    ", the system becomes infinitely sensitive , in the absence of thermal and quantum fluctuations , to variations in @xmath0 . at finite temperature",
    ", the energy stored in the oscillation can always be made larger than thermal fluctuations by increasing the scale of @xmath0 , thus preserving sensitivity .",
    "small variations in @xmath0 are transformed into readily discernible changes in the escape rate @xmath4 from state 0 to 1 .",
    "back - action is minimized in this arrangement since the only fluctuations felt at the input port arise from the fluctuations of the @xmath5 drive port whose dissipative elements are physically separated from the junction via a transmission line of arbitrary length and can therefore be thermalized efficiently to base temperature .",
    "additionally , the frequency band over which the back - action contributes is narrow , and well controlled .    in section 2 , simplified expressions adapted from the theory of activated escape in a driven non - linear oscillator @xcite",
    "are presented .",
    "details of the devices and the measurement setup are presented in section 3 .",
    "experimental results are given in section 3 , and concluding remarks are in section 4 .",
    "the tunnelling of cooper pairs manifests itself as a non - linear inductance that shunts the linear junction self - capacitance @xmath6 , formed by the junction electrodes and the tunnel oxide layer .",
    "the constitutive relation of the non - linear inductor can be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the current , gauge - invariant phase - difference and voltage corresponding to the inductor , respectively , while the parameter @xmath0 is the junction critical current . here",
    "@xmath11 is the reduced flux quantum .",
    "the dynamics of the junction are given by the time evolution of @xmath12 , which exhibits the motion of a phase particle in a cosine potential @xmath13 .",
    "for small oscillation amplitude about the potential minima , the frequency of oscillation is given for zero dc bias current by the plasma frequency @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the effective junction inductance .",
    "as the oscillation amplitude increases , the potential `` softens '' and @xmath16 decreases , an effect which has been measured in both the classical and quantum regime @xcite .",
    "a more dramatic non - linear effect manifests itself if the junction is driven with an ac current @xmath17 at a frequency @xmath2 slightly below @xmath18 . if the quality factor @xmath19 $ ] is greater than @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the impedance of the junction electrodynamic environment and @xmath22 the detuning parameter , then the junction switches from one dynamical oscillation state to another when @xmath3 is ramped above a critical value @xmath23 @xcite . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the oscillation state is low - amplitude and phase - lagging while for @xmath25 , the oscillation state is high - amplitude and phase - leading",
    ". this generic non - linear phenomenon , which we refer to as `` dynamical switching '' , is reminiscent of the usual `` static switching '' of the junction from the zero - voltage state to the voltage state when the dc current bias exceeds the critical current @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , an important distinction between dynamical and static switching is that in dynamical switching , the phase particle remains confined to only one well of the junction cosine potential , and the time - average value of @xmath12 is always zero .",
    "the junction never switches to the voltage  state , and thus no dc voltage is generated .",
    "also , for dynamical switching , the current @xmath23 depends both on @xmath26 and on the detuning @xmath27 .        in presence of the microwave drive @xmath1",
    ", the oscillations in the junction phase can be parameterized using in - phase and quadrature phase components @xmath28 ( higher harmonics of oscillation are negligible).the two oscillation states appear as two points in the @xmath29 plane and are denoted by vectors labelled 0 and 1 ( see fig .",
    "the error - current @xcite which describes the generalized force felt by the system is also plotted in the @xmath30 plane .",
    "its value goes to zero at the attractors corresponding to states 0 and 1 and also at a third extremum which is the dynamical saddle point . also shown in fig .",
    "2 is the calculated escape trajectory @xcite from state 0 ( dashed ) and the corresponding retrappping trajectory @xcite into state 1 ( solid line ) .",
    "2 has been computed for @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "these values correspond to typical operating conditions in our experiment .",
    "the dynamical switching from state 0 to 1 is characterized by a phase shift given here by @xmath34 = -139\\,\\mathrm{deg}$ ] . using the junction phase - voltage relationship and the transmission line equations",
    ", we can calculate the steady - state magnitude and phase of the reflected microwave drive signal . the change in the oscillation of @xmath12 results in a shift of the reflected signal phase @xmath35 .",
    "since there is no source of dissipation in the junction chip , there should be no change in the magnitude of the reflected signal power , even though @xmath36 .",
    "both static and dynamical switching can be described by an arhennius law in which the escape rate @xmath37 is written as the product of an attempt frequency @xmath38 and a boltzman factor which contains the potential barrier height @xmath39 and the system temperature @xmath40 . for the case of a dc current bias , the cosine potential , near the switching point ,",
    "is approximated as a cubic potential with height @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bias current .",
    "the attempt frequency is the plasma frequency @xmath43 in the absence of fluctuations , the characteristic current at which switching occurs is @xmath44 for the ac driven junction , the dynamical switching from oscillation state 0 to 1 can be cast in a similar form using the model of a particle in a cubic metapotential @xcite . in this case , the effective barrier height is , to lowest order in @xmath45 , @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the attempt frequency in the metapotential is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the bifucrcation current @xmath23 where the 0 state ceases to exist is given by @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "typical junction fabrication parameters limit the plasma frequency to the 20 - 100 ghz range where techniques for addressing junction dynamics are inconvenient . we have chosen to shunt the junction by a capacitive admittance to lower the plasma frequency by more than an order of magnitude and attain a frequency in 1 - 2 ghz range ( microwave l - band ) .  in this frequency range ,",
    "a simple on - chip electrodynamic environment with minimum parasitic elements can be implemented , and the hardware for precise signal generation and processing is readily available . in the first step of sample fabrication , a metallic underlayer  either a normal metal ( au , cu ) or a superconductor ( nb )  was deposited on a silicon substrate to form one plate of the shunting capacitor , followed by the deposition of an insulating @xmath52 layer . using e - beam lithography and double - angle shadow mask evaporation , we subsequently fabricated the top capacitor plates along with a micron sized @xmath53 tunnel junction .",
    "the critical current of the junction  was in the range @xmath54 . by varying both the dielectric layer thickness and the pad area ,",
    "the capacitance @xmath55 was varied between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the junction + capacitor chip is placed on a microwave circuit - board and is wire - bonded to the end of a coplanar stripline which is soldered to a coaxial launcher affixed to the side wall of the copper sample box .",
    "we anchor the rf leak - tight sample box to the cold stage of a @xmath58 refrigerator with base temperature @xmath59 .",
    "the measurement setup is schematically shown in fig .",
    "microwave excitation signals are coupled to the sample via the -13 db side port of a directional coupler .",
    "the reflected microwave signal passes through the direct port of the coupler , and is amplified first using a cryogenic @xmath60 hemt amplifier with noise temperature @xmath61 .",
    "a dc bias current can be applied to the junction by way of a bias tee .",
    "we use cryogenic attenuators , isolators , and specially developed dissipative microstrip filters on the microwave lines in addition to copper - powder and other passive filters @xcite on the dc lines to shield the junction from spurious electromagnetic noise . in the first set of experiments which probe the plasma resonance , a vector network analyzer",
    "was used to both source a cw microwave signal and to analyze the reflected power @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the transition between the two oscillation states was then probed using microwave pulses @xcite , generated by the amplitude modulation of a cw source with a phase - locked arbitrary waveform generator with @xmath62 resolution . for the pulsed experiments ,",
    "the reflected signal was mixed down to @xmath63 and digitally demodulated using a @xmath64 digitizer to extract the signal phase @xmath65 .     coaxial transmission lines .",
    "the network analyzer is used for cw measurements .",
    "for probing the dynamics , the sample is switched to the pulse generator and phase detector . a lumped element model for the junction chip and measurement line",
    "is shown in the lower right .",
    "the two ideal current sources actually represent external sources.,width=326 ]",
    "we first probed the drive current dependence of the reflected signal phase @xmath66 by applying a @xmath67 long symmetric triangular shaped pulse with a peak value @xmath68 .",
    "the demodulated reflected signal was divided into @xmath69 sections , each yielding one measurement of @xmath65 for a corresponding value of @xmath3 .",
    "the measurement was repeated @xmath70 times to obtain a distribution of @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "4 , the mode of the distribution is plotted as a function of @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the bifurcation amplifier is always in state 0 , @xmath65 is constant and assigned a value of @xmath74 . as the drive current is increased above @xmath75 , thermal fluctuations are sufficiently large to cause transitions to the 1 state . in the region between the two dashed lines at @xmath76 and @xmath77 , @xmath65 displays a bimodal distribution with peaks centered at @xmath78 and @xmath79 with the latter corresponding to the amplifier in the 1 state . the dotted line in fig .",
    "4 is the average reflected signal phase @xmath80 .",
    "when @xmath72 is increased above @xmath81 , the system is only found in state 1 . in the decreasing part of the @xmath3 ramp ,",
    "the system does not start to switch back to state 0 until @xmath82 .",
    "the critical switching currents @xmath23 for the @xmath83 transition and @xmath84 for the @xmath85 transition , calculated from numerical simulations to treat the inductance of wire bonds , are denoted with ticks in fig .",
    "4 , and are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the hysteresis @xmath86 is a consequence of the asymmetry in the escape barrier height for the two states .",
    "thus , the @xmath83 transition at @xmath87 is nearly irreversible , allowing the bifurcation amplifier to latch and store its output during the integration time set by the sensitivity of the follower amplifier .    to determine the sensitivity of the bifurcation amplifier , we have characterized in detail the switching in the vicinity of the @xmath83 transition .",
    "we excited the system with two different readout pulse protocols . in the first protocol ,",
    "the drive current was ramped from 0 to its maximum value in @xmath88 and was then held constant for @xmath88 before returning to 0 .",
    "only the final @xmath69 of the constant drive period were used to determine the oscillation phase with the first @xmath69 allotted for settling of the phase .",
    "histograms taken with a @xmath89 acquisition rate are shown in fig .",
    "5 . in the upper panel ,",
    "the two peaks corresponding to states 0 and 1 can easily be resolved with a small relative overlap of @xmath90 .",
    "the width of each peak is consistent with the noise temperature of our hemt amplifier . in this first method",
    ", the latching property of the system has not been exploited . in our second protocol for the readout pulse , we again ramp for @xmath88 and allow a settling time of @xmath69 , but we then reduce the drive current by @xmath91 and measure the reflected signal for @xmath92 . in that latter period ,",
    "whatever state was reached at the end of the initial @xmath93 period is `` latched '' and time is spent just increasing the signal / noise ratio of the reflected phase measurement . as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "5 , the two peaks are now fully separated , with a relative overlap of @xmath94 allowing a determination of the state 1 probability with an accuracy better than @xmath95 .",
    "this second protocol would be preferred only for very precise time - resolved measurements of @xmath0 or for applications where a low - noise follower amplifier is impractical .",
    "[ figsamplewl ]    a third experiment was performed to study the state 1 switching probability @xmath96 for different values of the temperature @xmath40 and @xmath0 , the latter being varied with a magnetic field applied parallel to the junction plane . using the first readout protocol and the discrimination threshold shown in fig .",
    "5 , we obtain the switching probability curves shown in fig .",
    "defining the discrimination power @xmath97 as the maximum difference between two switching probability curves which differ in @xmath0 we find that at @xmath59 , @xmath98 for @xmath99  the typical variation observed in a superconducting charge - phase qubit @xcite .",
    "the switching probability curves should shift according to @xmath100 , which for our case takes the value 5.6 . in fig .",
    "6 , the curves are shifted by @xmath101 , which agrees well with this prediction . for the case of the dc current biased junction , similar curves would shift only by @xmath102 since the switching current is @xmath0 itself . comparable discrimination power using dc switching has only been achieved in these devices at @xmath103 as the temperature is increased , the switching probability curves broaden due to increased thermal fluctuations and the discriminating power decreases : at @xmath104 , @xmath105 .    finally , we determined the escape rate @xmath106 as a function of @xmath3 by measuring the time dependence of the switching probability , using a method previously applied to the determination of the static switching rates to the voltage state @xcite .",
    "after the initial ramp ( @xmath88 ) and settling period ( @xmath69 ) , the reflected signal phase was extracted every @xmath69 for a duration of @xmath107 . by repeating this measurement",
    ", we generated switching probability histograms which we analyzed as @xmath108 .",
    "to obtain the escape rate at different temperatures , two different techniques were used . in the first method , we varied the temperature of the cryostat and used a magnetic field to keep the critical current constant at @xmath109 . in the second method , @xmath0",
    "was kept fixed at @xmath110 , and a @xmath111 white noise source irradiating the junction was used to increase the effective temperature . in fig .",
    "7 we show the drive current dependence of the escape rate as @xmath112 plotted versus @xmath113 for two different sample temperatures . data in this format should fall on a straight line with a slope @xmath114 proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "a trace taken at @xmath116 is also shown in fig 7 .    in parallel with these dynamical switching measurements",
    ", we ran static switching measurements to obtain an escape temperature @xmath117 .",
    "due to insufficient filtering in our rf amplifier line outside the measurement band , @xmath117 exceeded @xmath40 by @xmath118 .",
    "using @xmath119 and @xmath120 we can cast the results of the dynamical switching measurements into a dynamical escape temperature @xmath121 .",
    "we plot @xmath122 versus @xmath117 in the inset of fig .",
    "the agreement is very good , and only deviations at the highest temperatures are observed.@xmath123 analyzing the dynamical switching data with @xmath117 in place of @xmath40 , we extract a value of @xmath124 from the @xmath59 data with @xmath125 while the calculated value keeping higher order terms in @xmath126 is @xmath127 .",
    "with the jba operating at @xmath128 , it is possible to resolve with a signal / noise ratio of 1 a @xmath129 variation in @xmath0 in a total time @xmath130 @xmath131 , corresponding to a critical current sensitivity of @xmath132 .",
    "this value is in agreement with the prediction from the analytical theory @xmath133 , where @xmath134 near the bifurcation point and @xmath11 .",
    "the advantage of the bifurcation amplifier over squids @xcite resides in its extremely low back - action . since there is no on - chip dissipation , the only source of back - action is the matched isolator load , which is efficiently thermalized at @xmath59 .",
    "an important point is that in the jba , only fluctuations from the load that occur in a narrow band centered about the plasma frequency contribute to the back - action , whereas in the squid noise from many high frequency bands is also significant .",
    "finally , the bifurcation amplifier does not suffer from quasiparticle generation associated with hysteretic squids @xcite and dccurrent - biased junctions @xcite which switch into the voltage state .",
    "long quasiparticle recombination times at low temperatures limit the acquisition rate of these devices while the recombination process itself produces excess noise for adjacent circuitry @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the jba is competitive with the squid for applications where low back - action is required .",
    "its speed , suppression of on - chip dissipation , and latching make it ideal for the readout of superconducting qubits . at temperatures such that @xmath135 , the discrimination power would be greater than 95% , hence permitting stringent tests of quantum mechanics , like the violation of bell s inequalities",
