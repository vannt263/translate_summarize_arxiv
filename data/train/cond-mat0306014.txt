    "let us first consider pure annihilation kinetics with reaction rate @xmath13 .",

    "yet as we are mostly interested in the asymptotic behavior at low @xmath1 densities , this distinction should be largely irrelevant .",

    "for the correlator of the stochastic noise one finds @xmath74 which is to be understood as the prescription to always factor in the local particle density when noise averages are taken . according to eq .",

    "the distribution at @xmath173 is still fairly peaked , which may be accounted for by the initial high density of @xmath1 particles leading to homogenization of the diffusion rates .",
    "the distributions at later times ( scaled to match the average value of the @xmath173 distribution ) seems approximately constant , though perhaps the peak is slowly shifting towards smaller values .",
    "finally , we note that the measured values of @xmath157 were approximately the same for all systems , namely @xmath367 in @xmath21 and @xmath368 in @xmath204 .",

    "since we allow any number of b particles to occupy the same lattice site , the last reaction in ( [ rxs ] ) is required to maintain a finite particle density in the active phase .",
