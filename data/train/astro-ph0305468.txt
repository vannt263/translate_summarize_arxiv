    "the recent measurements of cmb anisotropies made public by the wmap team are in good agreement with a ` concordance ' cosmology based on the model .",
    "the unprecedented sensitivity , frequency and sky coverage of this new data set provides us the opportunity of asking new questions about the evolution of the universe . in this paper",
    "we present the cross - correlation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies measured by wmap @xcite , with galaxies in the apm galaxy survey @xcite . in the observationally favored models ,",
    "a non - vanishing cmb - galaxy cross - correlation signal arises from the distortion of the pattern of primary cmb anisotropies by the large - scale structures as microwave photons travel from the last scattering surface to us . on large angular scales",
    "such distortion is mainly produced by the energy injection photons experience as they cross time - evolving dark - matter gravitational potential wells : the so - called integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "on smaller scales additional secondary anisotropies are produced when photons scatter off hot intra - cluster gas , ie the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall use optical galaxies from the apm survey as tracers of the large - scale dark - matter distribution of the universe .",
    "the apm survey has produced one of the best estimates of the angular galaxy 2-point correlation function to date .",
    "its shape on large scales led to the discovery of excess large - scale power , and gave early indications of the model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "higher - order correlations have also been studied in the apm galaxy survey @xcite . for the first time , these measurements were accurate enough and extended to sufficiently large scales to probe the weakly non - linear regime with a reliable survey .",
    "the results are in good agreement with gravitational growth for a model with initial gaussian fluctuations .",
    "they also indicate that the apm galaxies are relatively unbiased tracers of the mass on large scales @xcite .",
    "moreover the apm results are in excellent agreement with other wide field photometric surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , for both number counts and clustering @xcite .",
    "the apm galaxy survey @xcite is based on 185 uk iiia - j schmidt photographic plates each corresponding to @xmath8 deg@xmath9 on the sky limited to @xmath10 and having a mean depth of @xmath11 mpc / h for @xmath12 deg and @xmath13 deg .",
    "these fields were scanned by the apm machine and carefully matched using the @xmath14 deg@xmath9 plate overlaps .",
    "out of the apm survey we considered a @xmath15 magnitude slice , which includes 1.2 million galaxies at a mean redshift @xmath16 , in an equal - area projection pixel map with a resolution of @xmath17 , that covers over @xmath18 deg@xmath9 around the sgc .",
    "we use the full - sky cmb maps from the first - year wmap data @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have chosen the v - band ( @xmath19 ghz ) for our analysis since it has a lower pixel noise than the highest frequency w - band ( @xmath20 ghz ) , while it has sufficiently high spatial resolution ( @xmath21 ) to map the typical abell cluster radius at the mean apm depth .",
    "we mask out pixels using kp0 mask , which cuts @xmath22 of sky pixels @xcite , to make sure galactic emission does not affect our analysis . wmap and apm data are digitized into @xmath23 pixels using the healpix tessellation .",
    "figs [ fig : apmwmap ] show these maps smoothed using a gaussian beam of fwhm @xmath24 deg ( left ) and @xmath25 deg ( right panels ) .",
    "[ sec : null ]    to determine the accuracy of our error estimation we run @xmath26 wmap v - band monte - carlo realizations .",
    "we simulate the signal by making random realizations of the cmb angular power - spectrum as measured by wmap , convolved with its measured symmetrized beam profile , to which we add random realizations of the white noise estimated for the v - band @xcite .",
    "sampling variance in the wmap - apm cross - correlation is thus evaluated by computing the correlation between the simulated v - band cmb maps ( with wmap kp0 mask pixels removed ) and the apm survey .",
    "we define the cross - correlation function as the expectation value of density fluctuations @xmath27 and temperature anisotropies @xmath28 ( in @xmath29k ) at two positions @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the sky : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , assuming that the distribution is statistically isotropic . to estimate @xmath2 from the pixel maps we use : w_tg ( ) = _ i , j _",
    "t(*_i * )   _ g(*_j * )  w_i  w_j , where the sum extends to all pairs @xmath34 separated by @xmath35 .",
    "the mean temperature fluctuation is subtracted @xmath36 .",
    "the weights @xmath37 can be used to minimize the variance when the pixel noise is not uniform , however this introduces larger cosmic variance . here",
    "we follow the wmap team and use uniform weights ( i.e. @xmath38 ) .",
    "we consider angular scales , @xmath39 deg .",
    "cross - correlations are expected to be dominated by sampling variance beyond @xmath40 deg , where the apm angular correlation function vanishes .",
    "fig [ fig : jacknife ] shows the resulting cross - correlation . on scales above @xmath41 deg",
    "there is a significant correlation above the estimated error - bars .",
    "fig [ fig : jacknife ] shows the 1-@xmath4 confidence interval for @xmath2 obtained using the jack - knife covariance matrix .",
    "surveys are first divided into @xmath42 ( similar results are found for @xmath43 ) separate regions on the sky , each of equal area . the analysis is then performed @xmath44 times , each time removing a different region , the so - called jack - knife subsamples , which we label @xmath45 . the estimated statistical covariance for @xmath46 at scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 is then given by : c_ij = m-1 _ k=1^m w_tg^k(_i ) w_tg^k(_j ) where @xmath49 is the difference between the @xmath50-th subsample and the mean value for the @xmath44 subsamples .",
    "the case @xmath51 gives the error variance .",
    "the accuracy of the jack - knife covariance have been tested for both wmap @xcite and the apm and sdss survey @xcite .",
    "we have used the monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations described above to find that _ the jack - knife ( jk ) errors from a single mc simulation _ agree very well ( better than @xmath52 accuracy ) , with the mc error from 200 realizations .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jackvs ] . the jk error from a _ single realization _ ( shown as squares ) is in excellent agreement with the mc error ( dispersion from 200 realizations , shown as continuous line ) .",
    "thus , in our case , using jk errors over a single realization gives an unbiased estimation of the true error , but the variance ( shown as errorbars in fig .",
    "[ fig : jackvs ] ) in this error estimation can be as large as @xmath52 .    on the other hand , _ the jk errors in the real wmap - apm sample",
    "_ are shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : jackvs ] .",
    "they are comparable to the errors we measure using the mc simulations on scales @xmath53 deg , where the jk errors are potentially subject to larger biases ( as we approach the size of the jk subsample ) . on smaller scales ,",
    "the jk errors from wmap are up to a factor 2 smaller than the jk errors ( or sample to sample dispersion ) within the mc simulations .",
    "the deviation is significant , given the errorbars , and it therefore shows that the mc simulations ( rather than the jk error method ) fail to reproduce the wmap - apm data on small scales .",
    "this is not very surprising as the mc simulations do not include any physical correlation that might be present in wmap - apm and assume a cmb power spectrum that is valid for the whole sky , and not constraint to reproduce the wmap power over the apm region .",
    "alternatively , the jk errors provide a model free estimation that is only subject to moderate ( @xmath52 ) uncertainty , while mc errors depend crucially on the model assumptions used to produce simulations .    despite these differences in the errors on small scales ,",
    "the overall significance for the detection on different scales is similar when we use the @xmath54 values below or when we ask how many of the 200 mc simulations have a signal and jk error comparable to the observations .",
    "when a particular mc simulation has an accidentally large cross - correlation signal , it also has a large noise ( jk error ) associated .",
    "we find that at 5 degrees only one of mc simulations have a signal to noise ratio comparable to the observed wmap - apm correlation on large scales .",
    "this means that the significance of the cross - correlation detection is better than @xmath55 .",
    "we can now estimate confidence regions in @xmath46 using a @xmath54 test with the jk covariance matrix : ^2 = _ i , j=1^n _ i   c_ij^-1   _ j , where @xmath56 is the difference between the `` estimation '' @xmath57 and the model @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath54 test gives a best fit constant @xmath58k ( the error corresponds to 68% c.l .",
    "@xmath59 ) for the 3 bins in the range @xmath60 degrees . for this range of scales ,",
    "a constant null correlation @xmath61 gives @xmath62 which has a probability of @xmath63 and sets the significance of our detection to @xmath64 .",
    "we find similar results when we use the mc covariance matrix ( eg , @xmath65 for best fit ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 for the significance of the detection ) but concentrate on the jk matrix from now on for the reasons given above .",
    "galaxy fluctuations in the sky can be modeled as , @xmath68 where @xmath69 models the survey selection function along the line - of - sight .",
    "we will assume here that apm galaxies are good tracers of the mass on large scales ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) , so that we can use the linear bias relation : @xmath70 , with @xmath71 and for the power spectrum : @xmath72 .",
    "in the linear regime we further have : @xmath73 .",
    "we can then define a galaxy window function @xmath74 accounting for bias , linear growth , and the galaxy selection function . for the apm selection we use the function in @xcite with a mean redshift @xmath75 .",
    "thus the galaxy 2-point angular correlation is @xcite,@xcite @xmath76 , where the kernel @xmath77 is a line - of - sight integral , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the zero - th order bessel function , and @xmath80 denotes comoving distance .",
    "we use @xcite for the linear power spectrum , with shape parameter @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "we take @xmath83 and @xmath84 which give a resonable match to the measured variance in the apm @xcite .",
    "the temperature of cmb photons is gravitationally blueshifted as they travel through the time - evolving dark - matter gravitational potential wells along the line - of - sight , from the last scattering surface @xmath85 to us today , @xmath86 @xcite . at a given sky position @xmath87 : @xmath88 . for a flat universe @xmath89 @xcite , which in fourier space reads , @xmath90 .",
    "thus : w_tg^isw ( ) & = & < _ t^isw_g > =  p(k )  g(k ) + g(k ) & = & 1  dz  w_isw(z )  w_g(z )  j_0(kr ) where the isw window function is given by @xmath91 , with @xmath92 mpc@xmath93 the hubble radius today .",
    "@xmath94 with @xmath95 quantifies the time evolution of the gravitational potential .",
    "note that @xmath96 decreases as a function of increasing redshift ( as @xmath97 ) .",
    "it turns out that for flat universes , @xmath98 , @xmath99 has a maximum at @xmath100 and tends to zero both for @xmath101 ( since the prefactor @xmath102 ) and also for @xmath103 ( because @xmath104 ) .",
    "the prediction with @xmath6 and @xmath105 is shown as a short - dashed line in fig [ fig : jacknife ] .",
    "[ sec : sz ]    for the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , we just assume that the gas pressure @xmath106 fluctuations are traced by the apm galaxy fluctuations @xmath107 with an amplitude @xmath108 , representative of galaxy clusters . note that analytical results based on halo models and hydrodynamic simulations show that this `` gas bias '' factor is scale and redshift dependent @xcite .",
    "however , for low-@xmath109 sources and _ linear _ scales one can safely take @xmath110 .",
    "note that the cross - correlation function is dominated ( its overall shape and amplitude ) by large - scale modes that are well described by linear theory , but a more precise calculation requieres non - linear corrections .",
    "thus a rough conservative estimate is given by @xcite : @xmath111 , where @xmath112k is the estimated mean sz fluctuation from apm clusters , what corresponds to a compton parameter @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the sz prediction along with the total correlation , @xmath114 , are given by the lower short - dashed and long - dashed lines in fig [ fig : jacknife ] .",
    "deriving more accurate parameter contraints from the sz effect requires including non - linear effects in the power spectrum , what is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the main result of this paper is a measurement of a positive cross - correlation @xmath115k ( 1-@xmath4 error ) between wmap cmb temperature anisotropies and the galaxy density fluctuations in the largest scales of the apm galaxy survey , @xmath116 deg .",
    "the significance of this detection is at the @xmath117 confidence level ( 2.5 @xmath4 ) .",
    "large - scale modes from the primary sw temperature anisotropies introduce large sampling variance and makes measurements of the isw contribution intrinsically noisy .",
    "the measured cross - correlation on @xmath118 deg scales is in good agreement with isw effect predictions from standard @xmath0cdm models . using the theoretical modeling in ",
    "iii.a we find a 2-@xmath4 interval of @xmath119 , with a best fit value of @xmath6 .",
    "if the detected cross - correlation is only due to the isw effect @xcite , one would expect a stronger isw - induced correlation on smaller scales ( see fig [ fig : jacknife ] ) .",
    "instead , on scales @xmath120 deg , the mean cross - correlation becomes negative , @xmath121k .",
    "this sudden drop can be understood as thermal sz contribution from hot gas in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the sz effect contributes to a level @xmath122k , where errors reflect the uncertainties at large and small scales .",
    "this result can be used to set bounds on the mean compton scattering of cmb photons crossing clusters ( see also @xcite ) . despite the high galactic latitude ( @xmath12 deg ) ,",
    "our results can potentially be contaminated by galactic dust @xcite . however , as illustrated in fig 2 , using the kp0 masked w - band , v - band or a foreground `` cleaned''map @xcite all give similar results within the errors .",
    "fig [ fig : apmwmap ] shows the isw and sz contributions at the map level . on larger scales",
    "the apm - wmap product map shows a clear correlation with the apm structures , while on smaller scales ( right panels ) this correlation fades away or turns into anti - correlation at the core of the largest structures in the apm map .",
    "these apm structures correspond to the very large scale potentials hosting superclusters or a few large clusters in projection .",
    "some of them appear to be anti - correlated with wmap in the product map , but with very similar shapes ( regions pointed by an arrow in fig [ fig : apmwmap ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the measurement of the isw effect is intrinsically affected by sampling variance from the larger amplitude modes due to primordial sw fluctuations . in particular ,",
    "if a real ( positive amplitude ) isw signal is `` mounted '' over a larger scale sw mode ( of negative amplitude ) it can produce a net negative contribution to @xmath46 .",
    "our findings are in agreement with recent work on the cross - correlation measure of wmap with nrao vla sky survey radio source catalogue ( nvss ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they detect a signal of @xmath123k with @xmath124 deg pixels ( 148 counts / pixel ) , what is consistent with our measurements once the different selection function is taken into account .",
    "our cross - correlation analysis on large - scales reveals that the evolution of the gravitational potential has been strongly suppressed at low-@xmath109 .",
    "the drop of this positive correlation on small - scales suggests that we might be measuring the sz - induced distortion of cmb photons by nearby clusters .",
    "deep large area galaxy surveys , such as the sdss , should be able to confirm these results , provide tighter constraints on cosmological parameters and improve our knowledge of cluster physics @xcite .",
