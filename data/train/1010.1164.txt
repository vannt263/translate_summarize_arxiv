    "our understanding of distant galaxies and the history of galaxy formation has undergone a revolution in the past decade .",
    "galaxies are now routinely discovered and studied out to redshifts @xmath8 ( e.g. , dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ; yan et al . 2005 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2007 ; bouwens et al . 2010 ) . samples of a few dozen objects have been found at even higher redshift , back to the era of reionization ( @xmath9 ) , and perhaps some galaxies have been discovered at even higher redshifts , @xmath10 ( e.g. , bouwens et al . 2010 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "this relatively rapid advance in our discovery of the earliest galaxies is the direct result of technical advances in spectroscopy and imaging over the past decade , in which the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) has played a leading role .",
    "historically , distant galaxies are found within deep optical imaging surveys , and are confirmed as high redshift galaxies with large multi - object spectrographs on 8 - 10 meter telescopes , which came online in the mid-1990s .",
    "it can be argued however that some of the most important advances in our understanding of galaxies has come about from very deep imaging , especially from _ hst_. the _ hubble _ space telescope has played a key role in high - redshift discoveries and our understanding of galaxy evolution through large blank field and targeted programs such as the _ hubble _ deep and ultra deep fields , goods , egs , and cosmos , among others ( e.g. , williams et al .",
    "1996 ; giavalisco et al . 2004 ; beckwith et al . 2006 ; davis et al . 2007 ;",
    "scoville et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "this _ hubble _ imaging has proven invaluable for two primary reasons .",
    "one is simply due to the depth that can be achieved with a high photometric fidelity , ensuring that exquisite photometry of distant galaxies can be obtained . whilst ground based telescopes can reach the depths of _ hst _ at optical wavelengths , in principle the accuracy and precision of this photometry",
    "is not nearly as good , due to a higher background , and importantly , the large and variable psf .",
    "this makes accurate measurements of light difficult , particularly for colours which require exact apertures for accurate measures .",
    "furthermore , _ hst _",
    "data have proven important for the discovery of the most distant galaxies in the universe through the use of the lyman - break method of looking for drop - out galaxies in bluer bands .",
    "many filter choices within multi - colour deep imaging programmes were in fact selected to facilitate optimal drop - out searches ( e.g. , giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "_ hubble _ imaging furthermore has facilitated a renaissance in the study of galaxy structure in the distant universe , which provides a key observable for understanding how distant galaxies form and evolve ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2003 ; conselice et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; lotz et al . 2008 ; buitrago et al . 2008 ; jogee et al . 2009 ; bluck et al .",
    "2009 ; casatta et al .",
    "these structural measurements have proven critical for determining how galaxy morphologies , sizes , and merger / kinetic states have evolved through time ( e.g. , trujillo et al .",
    "2007 ; ravindranath et al . 2004",
    "; conselice et al .",
    "this allows us to examine how the merger history of galaxies has changed ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2003 , 2008 ; lotz et al . 2008 ; jogee et al .",
    "2009 ) , and thus we can begin to derive how galaxies form , as opposed to simply when .",
    "it is not currently straightforward to measure the structures of distant galaxies with ground based imaging even with adaptive optics , and thus _ hubble _ has and continues to provide a key aspect for tracing evolution using these methods .",
    "however , one key aspect of parameter space that has not yet been explored with _ hst",
    "_ , or other space - based telescopes in any depth over large areas , is deep infrared imaging over a relatively large area .",
    "previously there exists deep nic3 imaging over the _",
    "hubble _ deep field ( dickinson et al .",
    "2000 ) and hubble ultra - deep field ( thompson et al . 2004 ) , as well as very deep nicmos imaging over a small area of the hdf - n ( thompson et al . 1999 ) .",
    "these areas are however very small , and while nic3 parallel data exists over the cosmos and egs fields , it is quite shallow at @xmath11 orbit depth .",
    "_ hst _ imaging data however has a distinct advantage over ground - based imaging not only in terms of the higher quality photometric fidelity and higher resolution , but also the depth which can be achieved in the near infrared ( nir ) with _ hst _  as opposed to the ground - based optical where comparable depths to _ hst _ can be reached . within one or two orbits , the _ hst",
    "_ can reach a depth in the nir which is difficult to obtain from the ground even with an 8 - 10-m class telescope , and which will not have the same photometric quality , nor resolution as the _ hubble _ data .",
    "we thus designed and carried out the goods nicmos survey ( gns ) , which is a large _ hst _ programme intended to remedy this situation by providing through an initial 180-orbit program of nic3 imaging in the goods fields , a data set designed to examine a host of problems requiring very deep nir data .",
    "the gns data consist of 60 nicmos nic3 pointings , centred on the most massive ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "the depth of each image is 3 orbits / pointing within the @xmath15-bandpass over a total area of @xmath16 arcmin@xmath17 ( buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ; bluck et al .",
    "2009 , casey et al .",
    "2009 , bouwens et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 present results using this data ) .    with these nicmos data we are able to explore the rest - frame optical features of galaxies at @xmath18 in detail .",
    "this allows a few measurements to be made that can not be easily reproduced with optical imagining and/or deep nir imaging from the ground .",
    "this includes : filling in the important near - infrared gap in galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ; sampling the rest - frame optical structures and sizes of galaxies out to @xmath19 ( buitrago et al .",
    "2008 ) ; and the detection and characterization of the population of massive @xmath20 galaxies and agn , and determining the relation of agn evolution to that of massive galaxies ( e.g. , bluck et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the basic outline , background , and results from this survey .",
    "we discuss the design of the observations , our field selection , as well as the selection for our initial massive galaxy sample which has guided the centres for our nicmos nic3 pointings .",
    "we also discuss the various methods for locating the massive galaxy population at higher redshifts , and the connection of these massive galaxies to those at @xmath4 .",
    "we show that no one colour method is able to identify the massive galaxy population at high redshifts , and that a combination of methods and photometric redshifts are needed to construct a semi - complete massive galaxy sample at higher redshifts . in this paper",
    "we construct as complete as possible sample of massive galaxies within our fields , and discuss the properties of these galaxies , as well as some features of lower mass galaxies .",
    "this paper is organised as follows :  2 gives a summary of our observations and the design of the gns , including how the initial sample of galaxies was selected .",
    " 3 gives a description of the derived parameters from the @xmath21band imaging , including photometric redshifts and catalogue matching .",
    " 4 describes our initial analysis of the survey data , including how the various selections for massive galaxies at high redshifts compare , while finally  5 is our summary .",
    "we use a standard cosmology of _",
    "km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , and @xmath24 = 0.3 throughout .",
    "the gns selection and field coverage is based on the previous optical acs and ground - based imaging from the original goods program ( giavalisco et al .",
    "the goods programme is a multi - wavelength campaign to obtain a coherent collection of deep imaging and spectroscopy in two 150 arcmin@xmath17 areas in the northern and southern hemispheres ( goods - n and goods - s ) .",
    "these two fields are centred around the _ hubble _ deep field - north ( hdf - n ) and _ chandra _ deep field - south ( cdf - s ) , which are areas of very low dust extinction , and minimal stellar and radio contamination .",
    "the existing goods / acs fields match the coverage of the goods _ spitzer _ program and cover the 2 msec exposure of the _ chandra _ deep field south and the 2 msec exposure of the _ chandra _ deep field north ( luo et al .",
    "large ongoing campaigns to obtain spectroscopy for the goods fields have also been carried out , including 3000 spectra as part of the keck treasury redshift survey ( wirth et al .",
    "another @xmath25 redshifts in goods - s have been measured from various eso programs ( e.g. , vanzella et al .",
    "2008 ; le fevre et al .  2005 ; popesso et al . 2009",
    "; balestra et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the co - moving volume probed by goods at high redshifts , @xmath26 , is similar to the co - moving volume covered by the cosmos field ( e.g. , scoville et al .",
    "2007 ) at @xmath27 . furthermore ,",
    "due to its depth at all wavelengths the goods fields are thus an ideal location for examining the formation and evolution of early galaxies .",
    "deep nir imaging of these fields however is lacking , although some deep nir imaging has been obtained with eso telescopes using sofi and isaac for the goods - south , as well as deep cfht wircam imaging , subaru imaging , and some keck imaging over the goods north ( e.g. , kajisawa et al . 2009 ; retzlaff et al .",
    "2010 ; wang et al .",
    "however , these data only reach modest depths of @xmath28 compared to our _ hst _ imaging .",
    "the depth of our suvey is only comparable to previous nicmos deep programmes covering the hdf - north and hdf - south fields , as well as new near - ir data obtained with wfc3 ( cassata et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "ideally , one would want to cover both goods north fields completely , yet given the small nicmos field of view it is not practical to cover the entire goods fields any deeper than one orbit with nicmos . the wfc3 camera will , however , soon cover these fields to an even great depth with the candels programme . our strategy is not to map out a continuous area , but to collect 60 pointed observations directed towards the most massive galaxies at @xmath29 found in the goods fields (  2.2 ) , maximised to obtain the largest number of galaxies based on our selection methods . to obtain the most unique and useful science we therefore constructed a program which covers a sixth of the area of a single goods field ( in total 43.7 arcmin@xmath17 ) in three orbits depth in the @xmath15 band , in areas of the deepest _ spitzer _ , _ chandra _ , and acs imaging , and where the greatest amount of spectroscopy already exists .",
    "some of these fields were then observed in the @xmath30-band ( @xmath31 ) with nicmos or wfc3 as part of a follow up programme to obtain near infrared seds to look for high redshift drop - out galaxies ( bouwens et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "our nicmos pointings were chosen to target a set of objects selected to be known massive galaxies at high redshift , identified using a variety of color selection methods .",
    "these include `` distant red galaxies '' ( drg : franx et al .",
    "2003 ; papovich et al .",
    "2006 ) , irac extremely red objects ( yan et al .",
    "2006 ) , and bzk color - selected galaxies ( daddi et al .",
    "2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "all of these methods are designed to find red , dusty or passively evolving older galaxies at @xmath32 . in practice , we utilised all three of these colour - selections separately , in order to obtain as much as possible a complete sample of massive galaxies at @xmath33",
    ". to optimise our field placement , we also used catalogues of lyman - break selected bm / bx objects ( reddy et al . 2008 ) , as well as high redshift drop - outs and sub - mm galaxies .",
    "however , the primary field selection was done in terms of the massive galaxy selection through the three primary colour criteria as described further below .",
    "colour selection of distant galaxies has a long history dating back to the early work of finding lyman - break galaxies through image drop - outs in blue bands ( e.g. , guhathakurta , tyson , majewski 1990 ; steidel & hamilton 1992 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that no single method can find all galaxies at a given redshift , and some of these methods are better at finding star - forming objects , as opposed to those which are more passive and evolved .",
    "in fact , it is generally agreed that no method or combination of methods can identify an obviously complete sample of high - z galaxies .",
    "one of the methods we use for finding likely passively evolving and dusty red galaxies is to find distant red galaxies ( drgs ) defined by a nir colour cut ( e.g. , franx et al .",
    "2003 ; papovich et al . 2006 ; conselice et al .",
    "the selection we use to find drgs , and to be included within our sample , is galaxies at @xmath29 with ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 mag in vega magnitudes ( or @xmath36 in ab mags ) .",
    "the selection for these galaxies is based on ground - based imaging from isaac on the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "this selection is only used for choosing systems in goods - s , as deep nir imaging over the entire goods - n field was not available when the target selection was carried out .",
    "this goods - s drg sample is approximately complete for @xmath0 drg selected galaxies at @xmath37 ( papovich et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "another selection we use to construct our initial massive sample is the _",
    "spitzer _ selected extremely red objects ( eros ) , otherwise known as infrared eros ( ieros ) .",
    "these were first described in yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , based on nir and _ spitzer _ data within the goods fields .",
    "the selection for these objects is s@xmath38(3.6 @xmath39m)/s@xmath40 .",
    "these objects were found by yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , based on sed fits , to have a mixture of old and younger populations .",
    "note that selecting galaxies in this way ensures that they are massive given their brightness in the ir .",
    "however , because they are selected with _ spitzer _",
    "imaging , which has a large psf , resulting in potential confusion from neighboring objects , this selection can have issues with contamination from other galaxies . hence any galaxies which would satisfy the criteria but are too close to another galaxy will not be included simply due to the problem of confusion .",
    "another method we use to select distant galaxies is through the bzk approach , which is described in daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in terms of selection within the goods fields .",
    "the selection for these objects is slightly more complicated than that of the drgs or ieros , since they are selected through colours using the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43-bands together .",
    "this method proposes to separate evolved galaxies or passive pbzks , and those which are star forming , or sbzks .",
    "the selection for these galaxies is done through the quantity @xmath44 , defined using these three bands by :      star forming galaxies at @xmath46 are proposed to have @xmath47 .",
    "the redder , possibly more evolved galaxies , are found through the selection @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "for the bzk sample we use , the selection is somewhat more limited than for the other colour selections as these sources were selected down to @xmath50 vega in the north and @xmath51 in the south .",
    "we utilise photometric redshifts and stellar masses of the galaxies selected through these methods to identify and study these colour selected populations taken directly from papovich et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "our initial massive galaxy sample from which we optimise our nicmos pointings are selected through these three methods , with a further photometric redshift cut of @xmath14 , and with a stellar mass cut of @xmath0 . in practice",
    "our final pointings were chosen by finding the locations within the goods fields where the number of these massive galaxies was maximised within the nic3 fields .",
    "in total we imaged 45 pre - selected massive @xmath0 galaxies at @xmath14 in the goods - n , and 35 in the goods - s .",
    "galaxies selected in other ways were also used to optimise the number of galaxies in each nic3 pointing , although each pointing was designed to have at least one massive galaxy with the properties above .",
    "these ` additional ' galaxies are selected through the lyman - break drop - out method utilising @xmath41 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 drop - outs , the bx / bm selection , as well as sub - mm galaxies from greve et al .",
    "each nic3 pointing contained between four to 19 of each of these galaxy types .",
    "figure  1 shows our field layout within the goods fields with the different galaxy types shown as different colours and symbols , and figure  2 shows a typical nicmos nic3 pointing of one of our fields .",
    "tables  1 and 2 list the statistics and positions of our 60 pointings , with 30 nic3 pointings in the goods - north field , and 30 in goods - south .",
    "we also list the number of various other types of galaxies within each of these fields .",
    "tables  3 and 4 list the initial massive galaxies for which we picked our fields , along with basic information such as their photometric redshifts , stellar masses , and information on the optical and @xmath21band magnitudes for these systems .",
    "nicmos and acs images of ten of these massive galaxies are shown in figure  3 .",
    "this data , including catalogs of sources , redshifts and stellar masses , as well as the original reduced nic3 imaging itself is available at * http://www.nottingham.ac.uk / astronomy / gns/*.          + notes .",
    "( a ) the values of the errors on @xmath54 and sersic @xmath55 are representative of the 1 @xmath56 model errors from galfit ( see buitrago et al .",
    "this does not take into account many possible sources of error that may bias these measurements , including magnitude of galaxy , concentration of its light profile , etc .",
    "the uncertainty in these structural parameters increase by on order of 10 percent for @xmath54 and 20 percent for @xmath55 due to changes in the psf across the nicmos nic3 field of view .",
    "also listed is the fitted axis ratios for these galaxies ( b / a ) , and position angles ( p.a . ) . the effective surface brightness ( @xmath57 )",
    "is listed , as is the spectroscopic redshift ( @xmath58 ) , if available .",
    "the value of ` sep ' is the difference between the position of an object and the identification of the spectroscopic target , in arcsec .",

    "<S> we present the details and early results from a deep near - infrared survey utilising the nicmos instrument on the _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> centred around massive @xmath0 galaxies at @xmath1 found within the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) fields north and south . </S>",
    "<S> the goods nicmos survey ( gns ) was designed to obtain deep f160w ( h - band ) imaging of 80 of these massive galaxies , as well as other colour selected objects such as lyman - break drop - outs , bzk objects , distant red galaxies ( drgs ) , extremely red objects ( eros ) , _ spitzer _ selected eros , bx / bm galaxies , as well as flux selected sub - mm galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we present in this paper details of the observations , our sample selection , as well as a description of features of the massive galaxies found within our survey fields . </S>",
    "<S> this includes : photometric redshifts , rest - frame colours , and stellar masses . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore provide an analysis of the selection methods for finding massive galaxies at high redshifts , including colour selection methods and how galaxy populations selected through these colour methods overlap . we find that a single colour selection method can not locate all of the massive galaxies , with no one method finding more than 70 percent </S>",
    "<S> we however find that the combination of these colour methods finds nearly all the massive galaxies , as selected by photometric redshifts with the exception of apparently rare blue massive galaxies . by investigating the rest - frame @xmath2 vs. m@xmath3 diagram for these galaxies </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore show that there exists a bimodality in colour - magnitude space at @xmath4 , driven by stellar mass , such that the most massive galaxies are systematically red up to @xmath5 , while lower mass galaxies tend to be blue . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the number densities for galaxies with stellar masses @xmath0 , whereby we find an increase of a factor of eight between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , demonstrating that this is an epoch when massive galaxies establish most of their mass . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide an overview of the evolutionary properties of these galaxies , such as their merger histories , and size evolution .    </S>",
