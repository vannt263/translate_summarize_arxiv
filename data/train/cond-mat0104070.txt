    "imposing an inhomogeneous pressure / temperature field on a ( porous ) material causes in general mechanical deformations and stresses .",
    "these ` induced ' elastic deformations in turn can and do influence the further mass / heat transport .",
    "the problem is described as a coupled field problem consisting of ( at least ) two equations ( a ) an elastic equation describing mechanical displacements due to a given source field ( pressure / temperature gradient field ) and ( b ) at least one transport equation for mass / heat with a source term originating from the mechanical deformation ( divergence of the displacement field ) .",
    "the entire description bases on continuity equations and constitutive laws which are discussed in textbooks in great detail@xcite .",
    "perhaps less known is biot s theory of hydrodynamic flow in porous elastic media@xcite .",
    "we will address this problem below in more detail .",
    "in particular we wish to draw some attention on similarities for the flow and the heat problem .",
    "we give the basic outline of biot s theory for the particular case of an incompressible pore fluid .",
    "this considerably simplifies the governing equations and their discussion , because all material derivaties can be eliminated .",
    "first we discuss the basic elastic equations .",
    "this is followed by a detailed discussion of the flow equation for incompressible pore fluids .",
    "thereafter we discuss some properties of the coupled equations , and finally establish their general integral following the spirit of galerkin s method .",
    "we specialize the obtained general integral for the case of irrotational displacement fields and make the connection to the problem of thermoelasticity .      in the following bold - face letters",
    "always indicate vectors / tensors .      the continuity equation for momentum density , @xmath1 represents the mechanical equilibrium condition , where @xmath2 is the stress tensor , @xmath3 any external body force , @xmath4 the solid s mass density and @xmath5 the mechanical displacement .",
    "we will neglect the inertial terms in the following and will consider biot s theory of porous media for the case of symmetric elasticity , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "deformations are characterized by the strains @xmath7 .",
    "employing hooke s linear relation between stresses and strains for isotropic materials one obtains lam s equation for the displacements , @xmath8 with poisson contraction number @xmath9 and young modulus e. there are a few quite general results about this equation , which will be useful in the following . taking the divergence of eq.([equation : lame ] ) one has , @xmath10 i.e. , @xmath11 is the solution of a poisson equation and for vanishing body forces @xmath3 it is even a potential function .",
    "the physical significance of @xmath11 is that it measures the local relative volume change due to the deformation which is an invariant .",
    "pure shear deformations are unreflected in eq.([equation : lame1 ] ) because they preserve the volume .",
    "of course all information on vorticity has been lost by passing from eq.([equation : lame ] ) to eq.([equation : lame1 ] ) . on the other hand taking the laplacian on eq.([equation : lame ] ) and inserting eq.([equation : lame1 ] ) into yields , @xmath12 this equation is of fourth order while eq.([equation : lame ] ) is of second order ; hence their solutions will be in general not identical . in his seminal work galerkin",
    "resolved this problem .",
    "he introduced another vector function @xmath0 satisfying the ( inhomogeneous ) biharmonic equation , @xmath13 with @xmath3 being the same body force as in eq.([equation : lame ] ) .",
    "he showed that the integral of eq.([equation : lame ] ) can be expressed in form of derivatives of @xmath0 , @xmath14 we would like to note that the foregoing considerations made no particular assumptions on the body force field @xmath3 in particular they apply to conservative fields .",
    "typically @xmath3 is explicitly known like for gravitational forces , or it is itself a solution of another independent equation .",
    "the latter is the case for thermo - elastic problems , in which @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the heat expansion coefficient , the @xmath17 accounts for the material s compressibility , and @xmath18 is the temperature field .",
    "typically eqs.([equation : lame ] ) and ( [ equation : fourier ] ) are supplemented by a heat conductance equation , @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the coefficient of heat conductance divided by the specific heat capacity .",
    "equation ( [ equation : garlekin ] ) then becomes a biharmonic equation with time dependent but known inhomogeneitis which do _ not _ dependent on the deformation themselves .",
    "as will be shown further below does flow in porous materials imply in general ` body forces ' being deformation dependent themselves .",
    "the deformation acts back on the flow .",
    "we will come back to this point in more detail further below .",
    "lets consider fluid flow in a porous continuum .",
    "the porosity ( local volumetric fluid fraction ) can be described by a scalar field @xmath21 .",
    "it is common to assume that the relative fluid - solid velocity @xmath22 can be expressed by darcy s relation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the fluid and solid velocities , @xmath26 the mechanical permeability , @xmath27 the fluid viscosity , and @xmath28 the hydrostatic pressure field .",
    "the continuity equations for solid and fluid mass are , @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , where @xmath4 and @xmath31 denote the solid and fluid mass densities . in the following",
    "we make the two important assumptions that the mass densities are constants ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .    from eqs.([equation : darcy ] ) , ( [ equation : solid_continuity ] ) and ( [ equation : fluid_continuity ] ) and the assumption of constant mass densities follows a ) that the local volume is conserved because the inflow of fluid volume into a volume element equals the solid volume outflow , and b ) that the flow equation takes the following simple form ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 i.e. a poisson equation for the pressure with the rate of the relative elastic volume change as source term .",
    "the porosity @xmath36 does not enter explicitly into the flow equation because of constant mass densities .",
    "as soon as @xmath25 has been determined from the coupled eqs.([equation : lame ] ) and ( [ equation : flow ] ) @xmath36 can be computed from eq.([equation : solid_continuity ] ) .        after the above preparations we will focus on the coupled eqs.([equation : lame ] ) and ( [ equation : flow ] ) describing elastic  flow interactions for incompressible pore fluids .",
    "note that @xmath37 in eq.([equation : lame ] ) , comp .",
    "eq.([equation : darcy ] ) . in general lam s vector equation ( [ equation : lame ] ) is much harder to solve than the scalar poisson equation ( [ equation : flow ] ) .",
    "however , for the _ very _ particular case of irrotational displacements lam s equation can be integrated easily , see sec .",
    "[ subsection : pressures_and_displacements ] .",
    "in general ( and also for most boundary conditions of practical interest ) displacements and velocities will have a non - zero rotational part .",
    "therefore @xmath11 or its time derivative will not contain the full information about displacements and strains , i.e. all elastic volume preserving deformations ( shears ) are unreflected in it .",
    "it has been convincingly demonstrated that for heat - conductance in solids the relative volume changes , @xmath38 , actually do also appear in eq.([equation : heat ] ) . however , the corresponding coefficient is for most solids so small that this term can be safely disregarded simplifying the theoretical treatment considerable@xcite . as an analogy to heat - conductance in solids",
    "one can think of a _ strongly _ compressible fluid , i.e. a gas in a porous medium .",
    "one can neglect the back - influence of the pressure induced elastic distortion on the pore pressure field and is basically left with the equations decribing a corresponding thermo - elastic problem . on the other hand does flow of an _ nearly incompressible _ fluid in a porous medium represent the ` opposite ' case : in order flow to happen elastic deformation must take place . without elastic deformation",
    "there is no flow and vice versa .",
    "we reconsider the flow problem eq.([equation : garlekin ] ) and make some small refinements .",
    "of course the pore pressure field is unknown in eq.([equation : garlekin ] ) since we have not incorporated any information from eq.([equation : flow ] ) .",
    "this needs to be done in order to obtain a fully decoupled equation for displacements .",
    "starting from eq.([equation : flow ] ) we have , @xmath39 this equation still needs to be complemented by boundary conditions for the pressure field .",
    "inserting eq.([equation : garlekin1 ] ) into eq.([equation : poisson ] ) and integrating employing helmholtz s theorem@xcite one obtains a relation between @xmath40 and @xmath41 which is in turn inserted in eq.([equation : garlekin ] ) , @xmath42 with the abbreviation @xmath43    equation ( [ equation : garlekin2 ] ) is the main general result in this section .",
    "it needs to be complemented by boundary and initial conditions for displacements and pressure .",
    "it is not difficult to see from eqs.([equation : garlekin1 ] ) and ( [ equation : garlekin2 ] ) that if @xmath44 the displacements are characterized by a vector - diffusion equation .",
    "however , the general case with non - vanishing curl is much more complicated ( it is described by an integro - differential equation in @xmath45 ) .",
    "while theoretical simplifications within models are usually appreciated a remaining question is whether the simplified model assumptions do lead to a consistent physical picture concerning certain criteria .",
    "one such criterion is stability .",
    "for example , is it obvious that the model equations are stable if one disregards inertial forces for the elastic continuum phase ?",
    "this problem is most convenient considered investigating the dispersion relation @xmath46 obtained from an expansion after eigenfunctions . for brevity we only present the basic result in the following .    assuming certain mathematical integrability conditions on displacements @xmath47 and pressure @xmath48 both fields",
    "can be represented as fourier - integrals , @xmath49 and @xmath50 inserting this two representations into the basic eqs.([equation : lame ] ) and ( [ equation : flow ] ) one obtains the dispersion relation , @xmath51 with @xmath52 being already defined in eq.([equation : d ] ) the dispersion relation has the form of a diffusion only problem , i.e. , all solutions are damped in time and therefore the equations are stable .",
    "the damping is controlled by a constant of diffusion @xmath52 in a rough estimate of order @xmath53 which is _ orders _ of magnitude larger than for molecular diffusion ( we estimated @xmath52 from @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "in the following we consider a particular simple case in three dimension : at time @xmath58 the material is loaded by a pressure peak @xmath59 .",
    "dimensionless quantities for the length scale , stress and time scale will be useful ( denoted by a star ) ; @xmath60 with @xmath26 , @xmath61 and @xmath27 being the permeability , elastic modulus and fluid viscosity respectively .",
    "because the chosen symmetry of boundary conditions guarantuees the existence of an irrotational solution lam s equation eq.([equation : lame ] ) simplifies considerable , @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the equilibrium pressure and @xmath64 a material constant .",
    "note that the solution for @xmath65 can be obtained by direct integration of eq.([equation : curlfree ] ) , @xmath66 equation ( [ equation : curlfree ] ) can be inserted into the pressure equation ( [ equation : flow ] ) giving an ( inhomogeneous ) heat conductance equation , @xmath67 with three dimensional solution ( green s function ) , @xmath68 where , @xmath69 thus incompressible flow in a porous medium whose displacement field is irrotational corresponds to a heat conductance problem in a fiktive non - porous medium .",
    "one can insert the pressure field eq.([equation : heat_dirac_solution ] ) into eq.([equation : generic_solution ] ) and evaluate the integral , @xmath70 in fig.[fig : ur ] we show the dimensionless radial displacements , @xmath71 , for two different times .",
    "the displacements being zero at the symmetry center raise to a maximum value and drop for larger radii towards zero again .",
    "as can be seen from eq.([equation : ur ] ) do the displacements follow a scaling form . the scaling variable @xmath72 may be anticipated for a diffusion - related problem .",
    "it is obvious that the deformations can be written in scaling form , @xmath73 with @xmath74 being a scaling function of the form , @xmath75 being plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : urr ] .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the root of the forgoing equation .",
    "we find , @xmath77 within three percent error .",
    "the volumes exhibiting positive and negative stresses are therefore separated by a surface of radius @xmath78 at time @xmath79 around the center , or equivalently @xmath80 with diffusity @xmath52 defined in eq .",
    "( [ equation : d ] ) , eg .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate gives @xmath81 for @xmath82 for the neutral zone .",
    "another interesting property is the asymptotic behaviour of the deformation for @xmath83 .",
    "the asymptotics is given as , @xmath84 it is interesting to note that neither elastic constants nor fluid properties enter this relation .",
    "only the permeability enters this compressional _ far - field _ decay .",
    "this relation should be compared to the simple case of a cavity of radius @xmath85 bearing pressure @xmath86 within an infinite non - biot medium with vanishing pressure at infinity , @xmath87 when one measures the bearing pressure in units of the shear modul @xmath88 .",
    "both relations are essentially the same , where the _ typical _ length - scale @xmath89 in eq.([equation : urr_infinite ] ) given by the solids permeability acts similar to the cavity - size in non - biot elasticity . in principle",
    "this should allow to _ measure _ the permeability experimentally for @xmath83 , which means in practice for distances @xmath90 .",
    "this observation leads us to the conclusion that the more complicated biot elasticity reduces for length scales much larger than the scale of diffusion towards convential linear elasticity .",
    "the maxima of the tensile deformations , @xmath91 , are readily calculated using @xmath92 @xcite , @xmath93 this value does _ not _ depend on the material s permeability .    before turning towards the mechanical stresses",
    "we quickly summarize the results for the polar deformations @xmath94 .",
    "[ fig : upp_delta ] shows the polar deformations . in a rescaled form .",
    "one has , @xmath95 with @xmath74 and @xmath96 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ equation : h_delta ] ) .",
    "the limiting cases are , @xmath97 and @xmath98      we now proceed to calculate the radial stresses @xmath99 which we measure in units of the shear modul @xmath100 , @xmath101 which is equivalent to @xmath102 we have plotted the rescaled stresses eq .",
    "( [ equation : stresses_delta ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : stresses_delta ] for poisson numbers @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the characteristic points of the rescaled stress @xmath105 do now depend on @xmath9 albeit not very strongly , i.e. , for lower @xmath9 one finds lower maximum tensile stresses , lower roots @xmath76 and higher compressive stresses .",
    "generally spoken do the _ polar _ deformations @xmath94 strengthen the tensile stresses and weaken the compressive region .",
    "higher contraction numbers @xmath9 do stronger weight polar deformations on radial stresses .",
    "the two limiting cases for the radial stresses are , @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    "we have considered a simplistic model for the fluid flow within a porous elastic solid .",
    "the presented description is given by linear equations .",
    "essential simplifications are : vanishing inertial forces of the solid phase and vanishing fluid compressibility .",
    "the first assumption relieves us of the problem of wave propagation in biot media .",
    "the second assumption allows us to construct a linear description .",
    "we tried to obtain some general results for the linear problem .",
    "it appears that the general integrals for biot s and the thermo - elastic problem are different even within a linear description . while in both cases",
    "the body force field is governed by scalar potentials , e.g. pressure and temperature respectively , biot s problem is a fully cross - coupled field problem .",
    "this changes the structure of the governing galerkin - biot vector - potential , eq .",
    "( [ equation : garlekin2 ] ) , substantially in such a way that _",
    "mixed _ space - time derivatives do appear .",
    "however , we were able to show that an irrotational displacement field garantuees an equivalence of both problems .",
    "though irrotational displacement fields are rare in geometries of practical interest , we studied the point symmetric case in three dimensions in order to exemplify the fluids action on the elastic strain / stress distribution .",
    "we quantitatively discussed the situation that arises when a pressure pulse within a borhole drives fluid through the solids pore - space .",
    "we found that radial tensile stresses arise in a region where non - permeable solids exhibit only compressive stresses .",
