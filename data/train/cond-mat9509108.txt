    "the possibility of observing the fractional charge of edge states in the fractional quantum hall regime has generated considerable excitement in recent years @xcite . while some indications of the fractional charge of the edge have been reported @xcite ,",
    "the situation is far from resolved . in contrast , in the integer regime there is a profusion of information on the dependence of the edge states on the number of electrons , the electrostatic potential ( gate voltage ) and the magnetic field , obtained mainly from tunneling measurements through quantum dots @xcite .",
    "this motivated theoretical investigations into the question of tunneling into a quantum dot in the fractional quantum hall regime @xcite .",
    "recently it was argued @xcite that tunneling into a @xmath4 edge state will reduce the tunneling amplitude by a factor of @xmath5 relative to the integer case . hence ,",
    "tunneling measurements through a small system in the fractional quantum hall regime indeed offer the possibility of directly probing the composition of the edge structure of the system . at zero or low magnetic fields",
    "the conductance consists of a series of well separated peaks @xcite , each corresponding to an additional electron added to the system .",
    "if the average peak conductance can be studied as a function of the number of electrons in the system , the theory predicts that for filling factor @xmath1 , for example , the peak amplitudes will fall as @xmath6 . since , however , tunneling peaks",
    "are observed when there is already a substantial number of electrons in the system , the tunneling amplitude in this regime may already fall below experimental sensitivity .",
    "this motivated the suggestion @xcite that it would be advantageous to study the @xmath0 regime , where the edge structure is particularly intriguing , and several theories have been proposed to describe the edge states .",
    "one picture , due to macdonald @xcite , is based upon a wavefunction proposed by girvin @xcite , which , due to particle - hole symmetry , consists of droplet of holes in the @xmath1 laughlin - state@xcite embedded in a droplet of electrons in the @xmath7 state .",
    "this wavefunction has indeed been shown to be an excellent description of the exact ground - state for a system with a small number of electrons under various boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "for example , greiter@xcite quotes an overlap of @xmath8 between the exact ground state and the girvin wavefunction for a system of @xmath9 electrons in spherical geometry .",
    "this @xmath0 wavefunction supports two different edges@xcite , one at the edge of the hole droplet ( of charge @xmath10 ) , and the other at edge of the @xmath7 electron droplet ( of charge @xmath11 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a very different edge structure was suggested by chang and by beenakker @xcite , and elaborated on by chklovskii et al .",
    "@xcite in a more general context .",
    "they argued that for a smooth enough potential an incompressible @xmath1 state will nucleate near the edges of the system , leading again to two edge branches , but this time of charge @xmath12 each @xcite . in the first scenario , where a single edge state carries a fractional charge",
    ", one would expect that half of the tunneling peaks will be suppressed , giving a clear signature of the composition of the edge states . in the second scenario , where both edges carry a fractional charge , all the peaks",
    "would be suppressed , resulting in a very low conductance signal .",
    "in this work we study quantitatively the nature of the ground state and the corresponding edge states in the @xmath0 regime , in order to understand which of the pictures is relevant experimentally . generalizing the girvin wavefunction to incorporate the possibility of a @xmath1 strip near the edge of the sample , the correlation functions in this generalized state",
    "are expressed exactly in terms of correlation functions calculated in the @xmath1 laughlin wavefunction . using the mapping onto a classical one - component two - dimensional plasma @xcite we calculate those correlation functions using classical monte carlo @xcite for up to @xmath2 electrons .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 correlation functions enable us to calculate the energy of the state for arbitrary electron - electron interactions and confining potential .",
    "we find that as a function of the slope of the confining potential , the ground state makes a sharp transition from the girvin - macdonald form to the chang - beenakker form .",
    "this calculation suggests that for heterostructures where the gates are not too far from the two - dimensional electron gas , the suppression of half of the peaks , in the first scenario above , should be observable .",
    "in addition , information about the actual distance between the two edges , which is a crucial ingredient of recent edge state theories @xcite , is obtained .",
    "the main results of this work have been published in a short communication @xcite .",
    "the results have also been verified by composite - fermion calculations @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we introduce the variational wavefunction and describe its construction . in sec.iii",
    "the correlation functions for this wavefunction are expressed in terms of the correlation functions for the @xmath7 and the @xmath1 systems , with more details in the appendix .",
    "sec.iv describes the numerical evaluations of the @xmath1 correlation function , while sec.v contains the main results for the @xmath0 state .",
    "sec.vi summarizes and concludes .",
    "the ground state of @xmath13 electrons in a radially symmetric system in the @xmath1 fractional quantum hall regime can be approximated very well by the laughlin wavefunction @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the complex coordinates of the @xmath16-th particle in the plane , and all lengths are expressed in units of the magnetic length , @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 denotes a second - quantization representation , where @xmath19 creates an electron in a first landau - level state of angular momentum @xmath20 , described by the single - particle wavefunction @xmath21 .",
    "the sum is over all permutations of @xmath13 distinct integers which sum up to the total angular momentum @xmath22 , and the @xmath23 can , in principle , be obtained by expanding the first product .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry - based wavefunction , introduced by girvin to describe the @xmath0 state @xcite , consists of @xmath24 holes in the @xmath1 state embedded in a first landau level state of @xmath25 electrons , and can be written in a second - quantized form as @xmath26 the yet undetermined number of holes , @xmath24 , must be chosen to minimize the energy .    in order to allow for the possibility of a @xmath1 state nucleating along the edge of the sample , we start with the laughlin wavefunction with an inside hole of size @xmath27@xcite , @xmath28 where the sum is over the same sets as in ( [ eq : laughlin ] ) , and",
    "@xmath29 can again , in principle , be evaluated by expanding the products .",
    "( clearly @xmath30 for each set of integers . )",
    "with the above wavefunction describing a strip of electrons with @xmath1 correlations along the edge of the sample , we write a generalized @xmath0 state , @xmath31 this wavefunctionis schematically depicted in fig.1 .",
    "it depends on three integer parameters . out of the @xmath13 electrons ,",
    "@xmath32 are described by the girvin wavefunction ( [ eq : girvin ] ) , with @xmath24 holes .",
    "the remaining @xmath33 electrons nucleate into a @xmath1 strip along the edge of the sample , with minimal angular momentum @xmath27 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "our task now is to find the set of parameters @xmath35 , and @xmath27 , that minimizes the energy of an @xmath13-particle state for a given confining potential and interactions . to this end",
    "we need to calculate the one - particle and two - particle correlation functions for this state , @xmath36 the normalization is chosen such that @xmath37 is normalized to @xmath13 , and @xmath38 is normalized to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the energy is easily obtained from these correlation functions , @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the potential energy and the interaction , respectively .    in principle , of course , if one can obtain the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 , all correlation functions for the @xmath0 state ( eq.([eq : tt ] ) ) chould be readily evaluated .",
    "this , however , can only be achieved for a system of a very small number ( @xmath45 ) of particles @xcite .",
    "correlations functions for the @xmath1 laughlin - like wavefunction([eq : shifted ] ) , on the other hand , can be straightforwardly calculated for a large number of particles , using a mapping into a classical statistical problem @xcite .",
    "such a calculation , however , is not possible for the girvin wavefunction ( [ eq : girvin ] ) , or the generalized wavefunction ( [ eq : tt ] ) , due to a resulting sign problem .",
    "the most important step in this work is expressing the correlation functions for the generalized @xmath0 wavefunction in terms of correlation functions for the laughlin - like wavefunctions for @xmath1 .",
    "the main steps in this mapping are described in the appendix .",

    "the single - particle distribution function @xmath48 , is simply expressed as the sum of the three distribution functions of the @xmath32 electrons in the @xmath7 state ( @xmath49 ) , that of the @xmath50 electrons in the strip of @xmath1 state ( @xmath51 ) , and ( minus ) that of the @xmath24 holes in the @xmath1 state , ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the two - particle correlation function , @xmath53 , is far more complicated . nevertheless , the various terms contributing to the resulting interaction energy have straightforward interpretations .",
    "the first three terms describe the contribution to the interaction energy from interactions within the three different components .",
    "the next six terms describe the direct ( hartree ) interactions between the three components , the @xmath24 holes in the @xmath1 state , the @xmath54 electrons in the @xmath7 state , and the @xmath50 electrons in the @xmath1 strip .",
    "the last three nontrivial terms correspond to the exchange and correlation interactions between the different components .",
    "eq.([eq : mapping ] ) enables us to express the one- and two - particle correlation functions for the @xmath0 state in terms of quantities evaluated for the @xmath1 states ( eq.[eq : laughlin ] and eq.[eq : shifted ] ) .",
    "we calculate the @xmath1 correlation functions using classical monte carlo method @xcite , based on the mapping of expectation values in the laughlin state into statistical correlation functions for a two - dimensional classical plasma @xcite , which for the wavefunction ( [ eq : shifted ] ) takes the form    @xmath55 .",
    "\\label{eq : plasma}\\ ] ]    @xmath56 corresponds to the special case eq.([eq : laughlin ] ) .",
    "the term in the brackets can now be considered as the hamiltonian for a classical system , for which monte carlo calculations can be applied .",
    "2 depicts the one and two - particle correlation functions for @xmath57 and @xmath2 particles .",
    "similar results can be easily obtained for larger systems . as the number of particles increases , the edge structure in the single - particle density shifts to larger distances , without a significant change in the bulk density , while the two - particle correlation function reaches a similar maximum , but decays on a longer length scale .",
    "the main numerical problem in the present work is not the calculation of the correlation functions for large number of particles , but the increasing number of possible parameter sets that needs to be considered .",
    "accordingly we limit ourselves to systems with up to @xmath2 electrons .",
    "in addition we have to calculate @xmath58 , the average occupation of the @xmath16-th state .",
    "this quantity is somewhat more complicated to calculate , and so far it has been calculated with only a partial success @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is that the expression of the density in terms of the occupation numbers , @xmath59 involves nonorthogonal functions , @xmath60 .",
    "the significant overlap between them makes impossible the extraction of the occupations from the density profile @xcite . in this work",
    "we use a novel idea to calculate the occupations using correlation functions for an @xmath39-state , @xmath61 |\\phi_i(r)|^2 ,   \\label{nm }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 can be easily obtained by expanding the laughlin wavefunction .",
    "comparing eqs.([eq : occupations ] ) and ( [ nm ] ) shows that the occupations for the @xmath13-electron system , @xmath63 , can be directly evaluated by numerically calculating the averages of the functions @xmath62 in the @xmath39-particle system . in fig .",
    "3 we show a comparison between the one - particle distribution function deduced from the occupations such calculated and the independently calculated distribution function for @xmath57 particles . an excellent agreement is observed . in addition , the occupations near the edge were found to obey various exact relations obtained by directly expanding the laughlin wavefunction@xcite .",
    "having obtained the correlation function for the generalized @xmath0 state ( [ eq : tt ] ) , its energy can easily be evaluated for any choice of interactions and confining potential . in order to be as close to the experimental situation as possible , we present results for coulomb interactions , @xmath64 .",
    "rather similar results have been found for other types of interactions , such as screened or logarithmic ones .",
    "as all the wavefunctions have uniform bulk density , they differ only by their structure near the edge , or , alternatively , by the occupations of the single - electron states near the fermi energy . accordingly , as indeed verified numerically , the only relevant ingredient of the confining potential is its slope at the fermi energy .",
    "the detailed results will be presented for a linear confining potential , of slope @xmath65 , rising from zero to @xmath66 over the range @xmath67 .",
    "the position of the midheight of the potential step , @xmath68 , is fixed so the filling factor is @xmath69 .",
    "as discussed below , the physically relevant parameter will be the slope of the potential , @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath70 is determined experimentally by the distance of the gates from the two - dimensional electron gas , while @xmath66 is determined by the amount of voltage applied to the gate , as seen by the electrons in the 2d gas . for typical ga - as samples ,",
    "the gates are 120 - 200 nm from the 2d gas , which corresponds to 8 - 12 magnetic lengths .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath71 is typically 5 mev , while the boundary potential seen by the electrons is tens of mev @xcite . here",
    "we will express all energies in units of @xmath71 .",
    "the calculations were done for up to @xmath2 electrons , which is a typical number in an experimental quantum dot@xcite .",
    "in fig.4a we plot the number of holes , @xmath24 , which minimizes the energy for a step potential ( @xmath72 ) , for two values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 . for a step potential ,",
    "the ground state usually involves @xmath75 electrons in the @xmath1 strip , so it is of the girvin type ( [ eq : girvin ] ) .",
    "the number of holes in the ground state is determined by the competition between the two contributions to the energy : the larger the number of holes , the more uniform the density , and the lower the interaction energy . on the other hand , the larger the number of holes , the more angular - momentum states are occupied , and the larger the potential energy .",
    "thus , as the potential becomes softer , the number of holes may increase and a strip of electrons in the @xmath1 state may form near the edge .    as can be seen from the figure , the number of holes in the ground state scales as @xmath76 , which shows the region of density different from @xmath0 is independent of @xmath13 , namely an edge effect . from fig.4a one can obtain the physical distance between the edges for large enough system , as a function of the confining potential .",
    "we find that this distance changes from @xmath77 to @xmath78 when @xmath66 changes from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "thus , unlike the case for slowly varying confining potential@xcite one can not consider those edges as isolated from each other , and any effective theory should include interactions and mixing of those states @xcite .",
    "since the number of holes is an integer , it will change , on average , every other time an electron is added to the system .",
    "this is the source of the prediction @xcite that half of the peaks for tunneling into a @xmath0 droplet will be suppressed .",
    "as the present calculation can not produce the tunneling amplitudes exactly , we estimate them by their upper limit , the average occupation of the angular momentum state the electron tunnels to . in the inset of fig.4a we plot this occupation as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the suppression of more than half of the peaks is clearly observed , with the right power - law dependence on the electron number .",
    "interestingly , the calculation suggests that sometimes the ground states of @xmath13 and @xmath81 electrons differ by two holes .",
    "it remains to be seen if this is a real effect , which will result in a more dramatic reduction of the peak amplitude .",
    "in any real system the potential will rise over a finite length scale , @xmath70 .",
    "we have studied the nature of the ground state as a function of @xmath70 , and we found that for a given electron number @xmath13 , and potential height @xmath66 , there will be a transition from the ground state being of the girvin type ( [ eq : girvin ] ) to a state which includes electrons nucleating at the edge of the sample in the @xmath1 state . by varying @xmath66 it is found the transition occurs at the same ratio of @xmath65 , namely at a given slope of the confining potential .",
    "for example , for @xmath82 electrons the ground state evolves smoothly from @xmath83 and @xmath75 , for @xmath72 , to @xmath84 and @xmath75 for @xmath85 , and then it changes abruptly to @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "4b ) . thus the two edges , of the electron droplet and the hole droplet suddenly merge , and a @xmath1 strip forms , signaling a transition from the girvin - macdonald picture to the picture presented by chang and by beenakker @xcite and chklovskii et al .",
    "@xcite . this strip moves away from the edge of the electron droplet ( @xmath88 ) as @xmath65 decreases .",
    "for example , for @xmath89 the ground state corresponds to @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "for @xmath91 electrons one can actually see two transitions . for @xmath85 the ground state changes from @xmath92 and @xmath75 to @xmath93 and @xmath75 , namely it is still described by eq.([eq : girvin ] ) , but the two edges have merged , while for @xmath94 nucleation first occurs with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this intermediate regime where the two edges merged may suggest a possible description in terms of a single @xmath0 edge @xcite .",
    "similar transitions have been observed for other forms of confining potentials and electron - electron interactions . as the slope of the potential in experimental systems@xcite is",
    "if the order of @xmath97 @xmath98 @xcite , we predict that while the experiment still being in the smooth side of the transition , the suppression of half of the tunneling peaks should be observable in quantum dots in present high mobility structures .",
    "the closer the gates to the 2d gas , the better the chances of seeing that effect .",
    "in addition , it is predicted that as a function of the voltage applied to the gates , ( which changes the slope of the effective potential ) , the tunneling peak structure will change abruptly as this transition occurs . for high voltages half of the peaks appearing in the @xmath7 regime",
    "will be suppressed in the @xmath0 regime , while for lower voltages , as extensive tunneling into the @xmath1 state will occur , most or all of the peaks will be suppressed .",
    "in conclusion , using an exact expression for the generalized @xmath0 state correlation functions in terms of the @xmath1 and the @xmath7 ones , we have been able to study quantitatively systems of relatively large number of electrons ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "consequently we predict a transition in the nature of the ground state of the system as a function of the slope of the confining potential and discuss its experimental manifestation .    in this work",
    "it was assumed that all electrons are spin polarized due to the strong magnetic field .",
    "there is experimental and numerical evidence that there could be a density and magnetic field regime , where the @xmath0 state can involve both spin directions .",
    "the transition between this latter state and the spin - polarized one can be also explored using similar methods to the one described in this work .",
    "it is hoped that this work will stimulate more experiments in this direction .",

    ", one can integrate over @xmath101 .",
    "the result will be nonzero only if @xmath39 of the quantum numbers of the the two slater determinants involved are the same .",
    "since the total angular momentum is fixed that means that the last quantum number is also identical .",
    "this leads to an equation similar to ( [ eq : occupations ] ) , with @xmath102 the average occupations in this particular state .",
    "since , by definition , the occupations of the girvin wavefunction ( [ eq : girvin ] ) are trivially related to those of the full landau level and those of the laughlin wavefunction , @xmath103 , the first of eqs.([eq : mapping ] ) immediately follows .",
    "the derivation of the second equation is more complicated . to calculate @xmath53 , one integrates over @xmath104",
