    "therefore both stable and quasistable states should be described on the same footing , as is the case if one defines them by @xmath19-matrix poles .    since a stationary state characterized by a real energy value @xmath21",
    "is described not only by a bound state pole on the negative real axis but also by an eigenvector of the ( self - adjoint , semi - bounded ) hamiltonian @xmath22 with eigenvalue @xmath21 , a  pure \" decaying state should also be described by an  eigenvector \" of @xmath22 but with complex eigenvalue @xmath17 . in the standard , hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics such vectors do not exist .",

    "the quantity that is measured in the neutral @xmath45 experiments@xmath275 is the instantaneous decay rate of the @xmath276 s into @xmath277 , ( @xmath156 or @xmath65 ) . in analogy to the instantaneous transition rate of @xmath278 into @xmath277 , which is given by ( 1.8 ) with ( 1.7 ) and ( 1.5 ) , we take for the instantaneous transition rate of the prepared state @xmath163 into @xmath277 the matrix element @xmath279 , where @xmath280 is the cp conserving interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the difference between the standard phenomenology and the model that we want to consider in this section is the following : our hamiltonian is @xmath281=0\\qquad[h_w , cp]=0\\ ] ] and our @xmath26 state ( @xmath151 prepared in the inelastic scattering process ( 3.1 ) ) is given by ( 3.27 ) , which evolves with a preferred time direction , @xmath42 . in the effective theory summarized in section 1 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath54 given by ( 1.2 ) , but the time evolving state vector is given by ( 1.6 ) ( and though it is only used for the forward time direction there is no theoretical reason that @xmath278 could not also evolve backward in time ) . for our model",
    "we define the ratio @xmath81 by replacing in ( 1.8 ) @xmath282 by @xmath283 by @xmath123 and @xmath284 by @xmath285 , since @xmath286 for an @xmath22 given by ( 1 ) .",

    "we know that @xmath300 ( hardy class function of the lower half plane , second sheet ) . if we also knew that @xmath301 , then one could prove ( using the riemann - lebesgue lemma for hardy class functions ) that @xmath297 also decreases for increasing @xmath61 , but it decreases less than an exponential @xmath302 . even though we do not have this information let us assume that the non - resonant background @xmath297 will survive the exponential @xmath303 : @xmath304 the magnitude of @xmath305 ( which can be calculated from on the positive real axis i.e. at physical values of @xmath306 because of its hardy class property@xmath217 ) depends upon @xmath123 i.e. upon the preparation of the @xmath26 state .",
    "since experimentally the @xmath156 are selected such that their invariant mass is near the center of a @xmath26-breit - wigner energy distribution , the magnitude of the non - resonance contributions to the observed @xmath81 will be small .",

    "( recall that @xmath46 @xmath335 is the space spanned by the vectors @xmath336 .",

    "this confinement to @xmath46 is an ad hoc assumption which can not be justified in an infinite dimensional space of states , except as the zeroth order of perturbation theory : if one considers @xmath348 as the exact hamiltonian and @xmath280 as a perturbation of @xmath22 and if one takes the eigenvectors @xmath349 and @xmath350 of @xmath22 as the zeroth order eigenvectors of @xmath53 , then one knows from perturbation theory that the higher order eigenvectors of @xmath53 are generally not linear combination of the zeroth order eigenvectors .",

    "it is not really needed in order to ask the question why the prepared state @xmath354 should be expandable ( with an accuracy of @xmath272 ) only in terms of vectors of the two - dimensional @xmath46 .",

    "the rhs is needed to explain the existence of the eigenvectors ( 1.3a ) with the property ( 1.4a ) for @xmath42 , and to justify the inclusion of these eigenvectors in a complete basis system for the prepared state vectors @xmath150 , ( where @xmath151 corresponds to @xmath357 ) . for these properties",
    "one needs the mathematical ( topological ) completion of the linear scalar product space @xmath111 ( appendix a ) .",
    "even if the @xmath277 decay of the long lived neutral @xmath45 meson state can be explained without a cp violating interaction hamiltonian , it does not mean that there is no cp violation of the hamiltonian . as was already mentioned above , the background term in ( 3.24 )  though it needs to be there  may be so small ( @xmath358 ) that it can not account for the princeton effect .",
    "also , the observed time dependence of the transition amplitude ( 1.8 ) , in particular the interference term in ( 1.9 ) , may be such that it can not be explained by the background integrals in ( 4.3 ) or ( 3.27 ) .",
    "therefore , we want to apply now the same exact theory of sections 2 and 3 to the cp - violating hamiltonian @xmath359\\not=0 \\ .\\ ] ] then , in place of the eigenvectors @xmath360 of @xmath22 , we use the eigenvectors @xmath361 of @xmath54 in the complex basis vector expansion ( b2 ) of the k - meson state vector @xmath252 : @xmath362 in here , @xmath363 are the generalized eigenvectors of @xmath54 , and @xmath364 are the degeneracy quantum numbers ( where now @xmath365 ) .",
    "the complex basis vector expansion ( 1 ) is , as before , very general and exact , under the assumption that @xmath366 and @xmath316 are the only gamow vectors with the right quantum numbers for the neutral @xmath45-system .",

    "thus if @xmath371 , then , as far as the princeton effect ( which is of order @xmath272 ) is concerned , every pure neutral-@xmath45 state obtained from ( 1 ) is adequately approximated as @xmath372 since the time evolution of the gamow vectors @xmath366 and @xmath316 is derived ( not assumed ) to be given by ( 1.4b ) ( with the additional result that @xmath42 ) , we have obtained in the rhs an exact theory which contains the standard phenomenological description of the neutral @xmath45-system with cp - violation as an approximation .",
    "no new physics has been developed , but the standard phenomenological description has been given an exact theoretical foundation .",

    "the purpose of this paper was to use the neutral @xmath45-system of two interfering resonances to test some aspects of the rhs - quantum theory of microphysical irreversibility .",
    "we limited our investigation to the hypothesis that the two decaying @xmath45-states are ordinary , first order , s - matrix - pole resonances ( by the choice of @xmath387 ) since the standard theory with complex effective hamiltonian makes the same hypothesis ( by the choice of a diagonalizable complex hamiltonian matrix rather than a jordan block ) .",
    "then we saw that the effective lee - oehne - yang theory is a subtheory of the exact theory in the rhs .",
    "it must be emphasized that this is not the case for the exact theory in hilbert space because the hilbert space theory does not allow for a complex basis vector expansion . as a bonus",
    ", we saw that the remainder of the exact theory , which is always ignored in the two dimensional effective subtheory , leads to a non - zero @xmath4 decay rate of the neutral @xmath45-system for large time even if we choose a cp conserving hamiltonian .",
    "this may or may not be of practical significance since at this stage nothing can be said about its magnitude .",
    "many more experimental properties are known about the instantaneous transition rate @xmath388 than have been used in our discussion in this paper.@xmath275 to make adequate use of these properties the background terms @xmath389 need to be investigated further and more of its characteristics needs to be known than just the property that it decreases slower than exponentially in time .",
    "of particular interest is the transition rate at instances around @xmath390 where it has been fitted@xmath275 to the interference term @xmath391 of ( 1.9 ) ; a result which , in that form , can probably not be obtained from the background term .",
    "these questions will have to be discussed in a subsequent paper .",
