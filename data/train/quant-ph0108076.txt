    "local hamiltonian @xmath2 has very recently attracted the attention of several authors in quantum information science @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , average hamiltonian techniques , a basic ingredient in non  local hamiltonian simulation , have been studied for many years in control theory @xcite , and are commonly used in the area of nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite .    from the perspective of quantum information science , non  local hamiltonian simulation",

    "particle hamiltonians , very much in the line of thought pursued to quantify the entanglement of multi  particle quantum states . in the most common",
    "setting , fast local unitary operations lu are performed on a series of systems to effectively modify the hamiltonian @xmath1 that couples them .",
    "a remarkable result is the qualitative equivalence of all bipartite interactions under lu @xcite .",
    "this can be shown to imply that any hamiltonian @xmath1 with pairwise interactions between some of the systems can simulate any other hamiltonian @xmath2 consisting of arbitrary pairwise interactions between the same systems .    at a quantitative level ,",
    "the time  efficiency with which a hamiltonian @xmath1 is able to simulate a hamiltonian @xmath2 can be used as a criterion to endow the set of non  local hamiltonians with a ( pseudo ) partial order structure , that allows to compare the non  local capabilities of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . for two - qubit hamiltonians , simulations using lu or",
    "arbitrary local operations lo have been shown to yield the same optimal time efficiencies , and the resulting partial order structure has been computed explicitly .",
    "this has led to the necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath1 to be able to simulate @xmath2 _ efficiently _ for infinitesimal times , that is , the conditions under which the use of @xmath1 for time @xmath6 allows to simulate @xmath2 for the same time @xmath6 , in the small time @xmath6 limit .",
    "equivalently , this result shows how to _ time  optimally _",
    "simulate @xmath2 with @xmath1 , in the sense of achieving the maximal simulation ratio @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is the time of interaction @xmath1 that it takes to simulate interaction @xmath2 for a time @xmath8 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to elucidate the role a number of resources play in the simulation of non  local hamiltonians .",
    "relatedly , we seek at establishing equivalences between different classes of operations that may be used in a simulation protocol .",
    "we first address the question whether classical communication ( cc ) between the systems is useful in non  local hamiltonian simulation . recall that in protocols that include local measurements , the ability to communicate which outcome has been obtained in measuring one of the systems allows for subsequent operations on other systems to depend on this information .",
    "now , can this ability be used in non  local hamiltonian simulation to enlarge the set of achievable simulations ?",
    "suggestively enough , the answer is yes in the closely related problem of converting one non  local gate into another",
    "non  local gate using lo .",
    "for instance , a series of two  qubit gates @xmath9 exist such that they can be achieved by performing a c  not gate and locc but can not be achieved by a c  not and lo @xcite .",
    "we also study the advantage of using ancillary systems in simulation protocols , as well as performing general local operations instead of just local unitary transformations .",
    "altogether , our analysis refer to the following classes of transformations :    * lu = local unitary operations , * lu+anc = local unitary operations with ancillas , * lo = local operations @xcite , * locc = local operations with classical communication .",
    "this paper contains the following three main results concerning the simulation of non  local hamiltonian evolutions for infinitesimal times :    ( @xmath10 ) locc ( or lo ) simulation protocols can be reduced to lu+anc simulation protocols .",
    "that is , for @xmath0-particle hamiltonian interactions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , any protocol that simulates @xmath2 using @xmath1 and locc ( or lo ) can be replaced , without changing its time efficiency , with a protocol involving only @xmath1 and local unitary transformations .",
    "each local unitary transformation may be performed jointly on one of the @xmath0 systems and a local ancilla .",
    "( @xmath11 ) apart from exceptional cases such as that of two - qubit hamiltonians @xcite in which any lu+anc protocol can be further replaced with an even simpler protocol that uses only lu on each qubit , the use of ancillas is , in general , advantageous .",
    "this is proven by constructing explicit examples of lu+anc protocols where ancillas are used to obtain simulations that can not be achieved with only lu operations , both in the case of two @xmath3-level systems ( @xmath4 ) and in the case of @xmath5 systems .",
    "( @xmath12 ) for two - qubit hamiltonians , we use results of majorization theory to recover the optimality results presented in @xcite . in view of the equivalence between lu , lu+anc , lo and locc protocols for two  qubit systems ,",
    "this solves the problem of time ",
    "optimal , two  qubit hamiltonian simulation under any of these classes of operations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce some known results .",
    "section iii , iv and v present results ( @xmath10 ) , ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath12 ) respectively .",
    "section vi contains some conclusions and appendices a and b discuss some technical aspects of sections iii and v.",
    "we start by reviewing some background material from ref .",
    "@xcite , of which the present work can be regarded as an extension .",
    "recall that the aim of non  local hamiltonian simulation is , given a set of systems that interact according to hamiltonian @xmath1 for time @xmath6 and a class @xmath13 of local control operations , to be able to produce an evolution @xmath14 for the systems , where @xmath2 and @xmath8 are the simulated hamiltonian and the simulated time .",
    "[ we take @xmath15 along the paper ] .    as mentioned above",
    ", one can consider several classes of operations to assist in the simulation , including lu , lu+anc , lo and locc .",
    "as in @xcite , we make two basic assumptions : ( @xmath10 ) these additional operations can be implemented very fast compared to the time scale of the hamiltonian @xmath1 ( we actually consider the setting in which they can be performed _ instantaneously _ and thus characterize the fast control limit ) ; ( @xmath11 ) these operations are a cheap resource , so that optimality over simulation protocols is defined only in terms of the ratio @xmath7 , that is , in terms of how much time @xmath8 of evolution according to @xmath2 can be produced by using @xmath1 for a time @xmath6 .",
    "another interesting parameter characterizing simulations , that we do not analyze here , would be some measure of the complexity of the simulation , that is of the number of control operations that are performed .",
    "we also note that the inclusions between classes of operations , lu @xmath16 lu+anc @xmath16 lo @xmath16 locc , imply relations between the sets of achievable simulations and time efficiencies .",
    "for instance , since locc simulation protocols contain all lu simulation protocols , we expect locc protocols to be more powerful than lu protocols",
    ".      the maximal simulation factor @xmath17 when simulating @xmath14 by using @xmath1 for time @xmath6 may depend on @xmath8 .",
    "however , we are ultimately interested in characterizing the non - local properties of interaction hamiltonians , irrespective of interaction times . a sensible way to proceed is by considering the worst case situation , namely the time @xmath8 for which the optimal ratio @xmath18 achieves its minimal value .",
    "this occurs for an infinitesimal time @xmath8 .",
    "that is , simulations of @xmath2 for a time such that @xmath19 are , comparatively , the most expensive in terms of the required time @xmath6 of interaction @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that , ( @xmath10 ) simulations for an infinitesimal time are a particular case of simulation , providing an upper bound for the minimum of @xmath18 , and ( @xmath11 ) any finite - time simulation or _ gate synthesis_ can be achieved , maybe not optimally , by concatenating infinitesimal  time simulations .",
    "we shall denote @xmath20 the limit @xmath21 , and call it the simulation factor of @xmath2 with @xmath1 [ @xmath20 corresponds to the inverse of the time overhead @xmath22 of ref .",
    "@xcite , that is @xmath23 .",
    "] then , apart from quantifying the time efficiency in infinitesimal simulations , @xmath20 has also two other meanings :    * @xmath24 upper bounds the time @xmath25 of use of @xmath1 needed to perform the unitary gate @xmath26 , for any @xmath27 ( _ gate simulation _ or _ gate synthesis @xcite _ ) ; * @xmath20 is the optimal time efficiency in _",

    ", we shall refer to condition @xmath31 as the small time limit , of which @xmath32or @xmath33 $ ] will denote first order corrections .      for any class @xmath34lu , lu+anc , lo , locc@xmath35 of the above operations and in the small time limit",
    ", the space of achievable evolutions using hamiltonian @xmath1 and operations @xmath13 turns out to be convex . then the following two problems ,    * p1 : * _ given any @xmath1 and @xmath2 , determine when @xmath2 can be efficiently ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) simulated with @xmath1 for infinitesimal times , denoted _",

    "the simulation of non  local hamiltonians using lo and that using lu+anc are equivalent ( see @xcite for details ) , in that any protocol based on lo can be replaced with another one that uses only lu+anc and that has the same time efficiency . the ultimate reason for this equivalence is that even if lo provide , through measurement outcomes , information that can be used to decide on posterior local manipulations , this information can not be transmitted to the other parties [ unless the interaction itself is used for this purpose , but this leads to null efficiency @xmath7 when @xmath40 ; then , unitarity of the simulated evolution implies that each party is effectively applying a trace  preserving local operation on its subsystem , and this can always be achieved using only lu+anc .",
    "the previous situation changes when classical communication is allowed between the parties , because then they can coordinate their manipulations . in spite of this fact ,",
    "cc does not help in hamiltonian simulation , as we move to discuss next .",
    "in this section we show that any protocol for non  local hamiltonian simulation based on locc can be replaced with another one based only on lu+anc and having the same time efficiency .",
    "this result , valid for infinitesimal  time simulations on arbitrary @xmath0particle systems , brings an important simplification to the general problem of non  local hamiltonian simulation , since it implies the equivalence of locc , lo and lu+anc protocols .",
    "we first describe in detail a most general protocol for hamiltonian simulation using locc .",
    "then we show through an argument that exploits the fact that entanglement only decreases under locc that any such protocol can be replaced with another one using only lu+anc .",
    "the key point of the proof is to assume that one of the systems is initially entangled with an auxiliary system @xmath41 , and to realize that a non  trivial measurement ( i.e. , a measurement not equivalent to some local unitary transformation ) on the system would partially destroy this entanglement in an irreversible way . since we are simulating a unitary process on the systems ( which should preserve the entanglement between those and @xmath41 )",
    ", all local measurements must be trivial , and can be replaced with unitary transformations .",
    "for clearness sake we will perform most of the analysis in the simplest non  trivial case , that involving only two qubits , because this already contains all the ingredients of the general @xmath0-particle setting .",
