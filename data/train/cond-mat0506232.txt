    "in applied magnetism , the coupling of the magnetic moment to spatial degrees of freedom plays a key role , and this especially applies to modern magneto- or spin - electronics@xcite .",
    "basically , this coupling is provided by the spin - orbit interaction , which in the example of magnetotransport causes the scattering rate of the conduction electrons , @xmath0 , to depend on the direction of the local magnetization @xmath1 with respect to the current . in the archetypal bulk ferromagnets iron , cobalt , nickel , and their alloys , the resistance difference for orientations of @xmath1 parallel and perpendicular to the current , i.e. the socalled anisotropic magnetoresistance ratio ( amr ) , @xmath2 , amounts to some percent . in nanostructured devices like magnetic multilayers , wires , or constrictions in the ballistic regime@xcite , this ratio may be enhanced to several ten percent .",
    "basically , the determination of the scattering rate @xmath3 and of the amr requires the knowledge of the scattering potential and also of the spin - orbit split bands at the fermi - surface @xmath4 .",
    "some special aspects of the amr have been evaluated by smit@xcite , berger@xcite , potter@xcite , and fert and campbell@xcite , however , the evaluation of @xmath3 for a realistic case is still lacking , at least to the best of our knowledge . in this context",
    ", we note a recent _ ab initio _ calculation of the intrinsic anomalous hall - effect which , in contrast to the amr , depends only to first order on the spin - orbit interaction and _ not _ on a scattering potential .",
    "this quantity was obtained by integrating the k - space berry - phase over the occupied spin - orbit split states of iron@xcite and was found to agree up to some 30 percent with data on iron whiskers@xcite .",
    "the present work is intended to a fairly systematic study of the amr , which is of second - order in the spin - orbit interaction , also in an elemental 3d - ferromagnet . by selecting hcp cobalt with a rather well known band - structure@xcite",
    ", some deeper insight into the amr may be facilitated . by choosing polycrystalline films ,",
    "we are closer to devices which invariably use polycrystalline materials .",
    "we will vary the structural disorder and the temperature in the films to probe the role of different scattering mechnisms .",
    "these basic properties of the films under study are examined in sect.ii .",
    "section iii is devoted to the amr in the technically saturated state with main emphasis to a still unexplained phenomenon of the amr , i.e. the socalled geometrical - size effect ( gse ) , previously observed in thin ni@xcite and permalloy@xcite films .",
    "another point of interest will be the absolute value of @xmath5 at low temperatures : for ni - alloys , already mcguire and potter@xcite pointed out the unsensitivity of @xmath5 against significant variations of the residual resistivity @xmath6 .",
    "the influence of different domain structures , depending on the film thicknesses , on the magnetoresistance , is investigated in section iv and will be discussed by using the results on the gse .",
    "this low - field regime , where the in - plane amr switches at rather small coercive fields @xmath7 , may be of interest for applications despite the fact that @xmath8 lies in the range of some percent .",
    "the summary and conclusions are contained in section v.",
    "by means of dc - magnetron sputtering at an ar - pressure of 2@xmath910@xmath10  bar , cobalt films of thicknesses 10  nm , 20  nm , and 188  nm were deposited on synsil - glass and oxidized si(100 ) surfaces and capped by 3  nm thick al - layers .",
    "the thicknesses were measured by a profilometer to an accuracy of 0.6  nm and controlled by high - resolution squid - magnetometry .",
    "x - ray diffraction diagrams ( xrd ) , as shown in fig.1 , revealed a polycrystalline hcp - structure with a slight texture of the hexagonal axis normal to the plane .",
    "surface images recorded by an atomic force microscope ( afm , q - scope@xmath11250 , quesant instruments co. ) yielded surface roughnesses between @xmath12  nm for 10  nm and @xmath13  nm for 188  nm and indicated the grain sizes to increase from @xmath14  nm to @xmath15  nm . within the error margins , these results turned out to be the same for both substrates .",
    "it is interesting to note that the grain sizes and their increase with thickness are consistent with a recent report for polycrystalline co on glass and si(100 ) substrates @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of all films have been investigated by ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) , hysteresis loops , and magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) . using a home - made fmr spectrometer operating at 9.1 ghz , the directions and magnitudes of small uniaxial anisotropy fields , @xmath16 , in the film planes were determined . on 20  nm co : si and 188  nm co : glass , for example , @xmath17  oe and 15.3  oe",
    ", respectively , was obtained and the orientation of @xmath16 could be related to the direction of the deposition process .",
    "magnetization isotherms were measured by a squid - magnetometer ( quantum design mpms2 ) along three orthogonal directions of the applied field @xmath18 at temperatures , which were of interest for the analyses of the magnetoresistances ( mr s ) in section iv .",
    "there also mfm images are presented in order to visualize the domain structure underlying the magnetization processes , see fig.7 below . for this purpose",
    ", the q - scope was equipped with a commercial tip , coated by a 40  nm thin hard co - alloy ( nanosensors@xmath19 ) , and magnetized perpendicularly to the scanning directions .",
    "the directions of the in - plane magnetization were determined by monitoring the domain wall motion induced by a small magnetic field produced by external helmholtz coils .",
    "the resistances have been measured by an array of four in - line contacts prepared parallel to @xmath16 by ultrasonic bonding .",
    "the driving currents were kept small enough to produce linear responses and the resulting @xmath20-ratios were corrected for the sample geometry @xcite to determine the resistivities of the films .",
    "the sample chip was mounted to the end of an cold - finger extending from the cold - plate of a pulse - tube cooler ( prk , transmit co. giessen , germany ) to the center of a warm - bore superconducting magnet ( 130  koe , oxford instruments ) .",
    "a pid controller and a heater allowed stable sample temperatures between 70  k and 350  k. measurements of the magnetoresistance in the domain states , i.e. at low magnetic fields , were performed by means of an electromagnet , by which also the angle between current and field could be varied .",
    "more experimental details are given in ref .. we should mention here , that the structural , magnetic , and transport properties proved to be largely independent on the substrate , i.e. synsil - glass or oxidized si(100)@xcite .",
    "this feature indicates a dominant effect of the polycrystallinity of the films , i.e. of the deposition process .",
    "for some practical reasons , we selected three films with thicknesses between 10  nm and 188  nm for the present study .    the temperature dependence of the zero - field resistivities is depicted in fig.2 for these three films .",
    "the data can be well described by a sum of three contributions    @xmath21    according to the inset , the residual resistivity increases linearly with the inverse thickness ,    @xmath22.\\ ] ]    the characteristic thickness , @xmath23 can not be related to an extra scattering by the film surfaces@xcite or grain boundaries@xcite since , the theories predict the 1/d - behavior only for small deviations from the bulk limit , @xmath24 . hence , the observed increase of @xmath6 indicates scattering by an additional , yet unidentified disorder in the thinner films . using the extrapolated bulk value , @xmath25 , the carrier density @xmath26 from hall - data for these films@xcite , and the free electron model for the conduction electrons in co@xcite",
    ", we find an upper limit for the mean free path , @xmath27 .",
    "since this length is significantly smaller than the mean grain sizes observed by afm , it may be associated with point - defect scattering within the otherwise crystalline grains .    since the electron - magnon scattering in co ,",
    "@xmath28 @xcite is small , the temperature variation of the resistivities should be dominated by phonons . indeed , by fitting @xmath29 to the bloch - grueneisen form    @xmath30    and taking for the debye temperature @xmath31=445  k",
    ", we find an excellent agreement by setting for the exponent n=3 , valid for phonon - mediated sd - scattering@xcite .",
    "the strength of this scattering , @xmath32 , becomes smaller in the thinner , more disordered films , however , due to coupling of the phonons to the complicated structure of the d - states , it is difficult to estimate , @xmath32 , even for single crystals@xcite .",
    "finally , it may be interesting to note that the present resistivities of the 188  nm film are almost identical to those obtained by freitas _",
    "@xcite on a 300  nm co film deposited by magnetron sputtering on glass .",
    "this applies to the residual resistivity , @xmath33 , as well as to @xmath29 at room temperature .",
    "significantly smaller @xmath6-values have been detected on diode sputtered@xcite and epitaxial@xcite films of similar thickness .",
    "the mr of all films has been studied for three principal directions of @xmath18 , defined by the directions of the current @xmath34 and the film plane , see inset to fig.3a . to give an example",
    ", fig.3a shows the three mr s of the 20  nm film at room - temperature . starting from a common value at low fields ,",
    "a negative mr is found for all directions of @xmath18 . while the longitudinal mr , @xmath35 decreases linearly with field ,",
    "the transverse and polar mr s contain additional contributions . above the saturation fields @xmath36 , where the films become homogeneously magnetized",
    ", @xmath37 , these additional contributions to the mr also saturate at values @xmath38 and @xmath39 , both indicated in fig.3a .",
    "this contribution results from the spin - orbit induced amr , since upon rotation of the magnetization either to the transverse or to the polar direction , we realize the angular dependence    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the angle between current and the direction of the magnetization @xmath1 .",
    "such behavior is characteristic of the amr of polycrystalline samples of cubic or hexagonal ferromagnets@xcite , and is illustrated by fig.3b for the in - plane rotation of @xmath1 in a field @xmath42 .",
    "details of the mr during saturation by ( weak ) _ in - plane _ fields will be discussed in section iv . here",
    "we look at the _ polar _ mr by increasing @xmath43 in fig.3a .",
    "squid magnetization data@xcite reveal @xmath44 due to a rotation of @xmath1 against the in - plane demagnetizing field @xmath45 , so that the angle between @xmath1 and current @xmath46 is determined by @xmath47 . for this case",
    ", equ.2 predicts a parabolic decrease , @xmath48 , which is depicted in fig.3a by the dashed curve in full agreement with the data .",
    "it is evident from fig.3a that the linear mr , @xmath49 , is the same in all directions of @xmath18 .",
    "no signature of the classical lorentz - mr , which is positive and proportional to @xmath50 , is realized for @xmath51 , even not at room temperature . due to",
    "the small mean free path the absence of this effect is plausible , while in epitaxial films it becomes visible@xcite .",
    "the linear mr has been realized before in @xmath35 on epitaxially grown iron , cobalt , and nickel films on @xmath52 and @xmath53@xcite and was quantitatively discussed in terms of elastic scattering by thermally excited magnons .",
    "roughly spoken , the negative mr can be ascribed to the suppression of low energy magnons , which results from the increase of the magnon gap proportional to h. the strong thermal increase of @xmath49 is illustrated by fig.4a for the longitudinal mr to which the amr does not contribute . in fig.4b , their temperature dependence is shown for the three films under study and compared to the result for a 7  nm thin co - film obtained by raquet _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "these authors fitted their data to a simplified model for sd - scattering by magnons@xcite ,    @xmath54    where the amplitude a changed only little from 3 to 4 @xmath55 . since a depends on the sd - exchange , numerical estimates are rather difficult .",
    "the coefficient @xmath56 is determined by the ratio of the mass renormalization coefficient @xmath57 and the zero - temperature stiffness of the spin - waves @xmath58 .",
    "independent experimental data for co yield @xmath59 in good agreement with calculations , and it was argued@xcite that @xmath60 might be rather insensitive to microstructural details of the films . consequently , we fitted our data to equ.3 admitting ( plausible ) variations in the amplitude a and found a larger value , @xmath61 .",
    "we believe that the difference is related to the rather strong disorder in the present films with a residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) near 2 ( see fig.2 ) , which contrasts to rrr=27 reported by raquet _ _ et al.__@xcite for their thickest films . hence , one may suspect that the granular disorder in our films gives rise to a stronger thermal renormalization of the spin - wave energies.      at low temperatures , where the spin - wave contribution vanishes",
    ", the amr effect should prevail .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.5 by the mr curves of the 20  nm and 188  nm films measured at t=78  k along the three principal directions of the field .",
    "the significant difference between the mr s of both films at smaller fields is related to the domain structure and will be discussed in section iv . here",
    "we focus on the saturated transverse and polar amr s , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which differ significantly from each other , but do not change very much with thickness ( essentially the same observation is made on the 10  nm film ) .",
    "this phenomenon is one of our main results : for all thicknesses , the polar amr turns out to be about twice as large as the transverse amr .",
    "at first , a sizable difference between both mr s , @xmath64 , has been reported by chen and marsocci@xcite for single- and poly - crystalline nickel films . they coined this feature as geometrical size effect ( gse ) and believed that it may arise from the electronic structure inside the film material .",
    "more recently , this size - effect has also been detected on sputter - deposited 4.5  nm to 100  nm thin permalloy films@xcite at a low temperature , t=5  k. this study revealed that by raising the degree of ( 111)-texture in the film , @xmath63 was increased so that the ratio @xmath65 tended towards two .",
    "an attempt to explain this gse by assuming an anisotropic scattering rate due to diffuse scattering at the film boundaries , however , did not provide conclusive results@xcite .    in order to explore the amr and the gse of our co - films in some more detail ,",
    "the absolute values and the thermal behavior of both @xmath66 are summarized in fig.6 .",
    "two remarkable features should be emphasized : ( i ) despite different temperature variations , the mr s of all films can be extrapolated to the same value at t=0 , as shown in fig.6a for the polar direction ; ( ii ) fig.6b demonstrates that the gse , i.e. the ratio of the polar and transverse amr s , remains almost independent of temperature .    at first , we address to the amr postponing the discussion of the gse to the following subsection . a thickness - independence of @xmath5 itself rather than of the ratio @xmath67 has been pointed out earlier for @xmath68 and @xmath69 alloys ( see fig.17 of ref . ) . for all present co - films",
    ", @xmath70 follows from fig.6a , and we suspect that the origin of this amr resides in the crystalline regions , to which we tentatively assigned already the bulk residual resistivity , @xmath71 , in sect.ii .",
    "there we determined the mean - free path , @xmath72 , which turned out to be much smaller than the grain sizes estimated from afm images@xcite .",
    "therefore , we relate the low - temperature amr @xmath73 also to the scattering within the crystalline grains and believe that the extra scattering , which enhances @xmath6 in the thinner films ( see inset to fig.2 ) , produces a negligible amr .",
    "in fact , a weak amr is expected for scattering potentials with reduced symmetry , e.g. associated with phonons@xcite or correlated structural disorder ( grain boundaries , dislocations ) , because in these cases the directional symmetry - breaking effect by the magnetization @xmath1 via the spin - orbit interaction becomes less effective .    analyzing the effect of temperature , i.e. of phonon - scattering",
    ", we employ the widely used parker - plot @xcite , based on the relation for the amr ratio ,    @xmath74\\,\\,\\,\\frac{{\\rho \\left ( 0 \\right ) } } { { \\rho \\left ( t \\right ) } } + \\left ( { \\frac{{\\delta \\rho } } { \\rho } } \\right)_t   .\\ ] ]     + this equation is valid under the two premises : ( i ) the electric transport is dominated by one spin - channel , i.e. the majority channel in co@xcite , and ( ii ) matthiessen s rule applies for the thermal and defect scattering .",
    "the validity of the latter has been demonstrated by the fits of @xmath75 to equ.1 indicated in fig.2 .",
    "then a plot of @xmath76 _ vs. _ @xmath77 allows to separate the thermal contribution to the amr , @xmath78 , from the defect one , @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , the extrapolation of the high - temperature data , shown by the inset to fig.6a , is consistent with a common intercept at @xmath78 = -0.40  @xmath80 .",
    "such negative contribution to the amr has been realized early on crystalline permalloy@xcite and , more recently , also on polycrystalline co - films@xcite .",
    "it was associated with phonon - scattering rather than with magnon contributions . at lower temperatures ,",
    "our data break away from the straight lines , which in the thickest film occurs at a rather high temperature , where @xmath81 .",
    "this feature indicates a change of the dominant defect type for scattering and has also been observed by freitas _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite on various co - films with different @xmath82 , i.e. different degrees of disorder .      as a guide for discussing the gse",
    ", we refer to potter s work@xcite , who calculated the amr s produced by majority and minority spins for polycrystalline cubic ferromagnets .",
    "he assumed an isotropic scattering potential , as it may be present in the grains of our films . calculating the sd - scattering rates , potter considered the effect of the spin - orbit interaction on localized 3d - states , but ignored the influence on the band - structure .",
    "therefore , we expect only a more or less qualitatively correct guidance by infering the amr - ratio from ref . :    @xmath83    here @xmath840.1  ev measures the spin - orbit coupling energy @xmath85 .",
    "the positive contribution to equ.5 arises from the longitudinal part of @xmath86 mixing two 3d - orbitals of the minority bands separated by @xmath87 near the fermi - surface @xmath4 .",
    "the negative term is due to the nondiagonal part of @xmath88@xmath89 , which admixes some of the exchange - split majority states to the minority band .",
    "the parameter @xmath90 accounts for the different scattering rates of the conduction electrons into the 4s- and 3d - states and is mainly determined by the density of states of the 3d - bands at @xmath4 . because the exchange splitting @xmath91 is significantly larger than @xmath87 , the negative majority spin contribution to the amr may be small relative to the positive one . taking @xmath92 from a recent experiment on co - films@xcite , @xmath93 follows from equ.5 . comparing this estimate with our result for the transverse amr at low temperatures , @xmath94",
    ", we obtain for the effective splitting of the two unperturbed 3d - levels , @xmath95 .",
    "this finding for @xmath87 becomes smaller if a finite contribution by the majority spins would be considered in equ.5 , but it seems to be reasonable regarding the other simplifying assumptions of the theory@xcite . here",
    "we mention the neglect of the effects of the lattice potential and the spin - orbit interaction on the fermi - surface and on the density of states at @xmath4@xcite , and also of possible hybridizations between the s- and d - orbitals@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will extend potter s results derived for an isotropic , i.e. polycrystalline cubic ferromagnet , to films with polar texture .",
    "let us recall that the amr originates from a symmetry breaking of the 3d - orbitals by the magnetization @xmath1 via the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the resulting anisotropic charge distribution gives rise to the scattering asymmetry of the conduction electrons into these 3d - states . on general grounds",
    "one may expect that a reduction of the symmetry of the ferromagnet structure weakens the amr@xcite , loosely spoken , because then the magnetization induced axial anisotropy of the orbitals becomes less effective . since the texture in the permalloy@xcite and in our cobalt films , both perpendicular to the plane , appear to be strongly correlated with the gse , we assume the mixing parameter in equ.5 , @xmath96 , to be different for the in - plane @xmath97 and the polar @xmath98 directions of @xmath1 . then equ.5 remains still valid for the in - plane orientations of @xmath1 and ignoring again the small contribution by the majority spins , we have @xmath99 in order to determine the effect of the film anisotropy on the polar mr , we introduce @xmath100 directly into potters@xcite result for the perpendicular conductivity of the minority spins , @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "for small spin - orbit perturbations , @xmath102 , the difference between the transverse and polar resistivities becomes :    @xmath103    by some trivial algebra we obtain for the gse from equs.6 , 7 :    @xmath104    hence , this simple model can explain the upper limit of two of the gse , which emerges from our data in fig.6b and also from fig.6 in ref .",
    "for permalloy films . moreover , this model ascribes the gse to the electronic structure , as it was suspected by chen and marsocci@xcite .",
    "consequently , the gse should not depend on the temperature which is fully consistent with our results depicted in fig.6b .",
    "equation 8 also predicts that the upper limit of two is reached , when the mixing effect due to the polar oriented magnetization is small compared to mixing by the in - plane @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath105 .",
    "this case seems to be realized in our films , see fig.6b , and also in the permalloy films with increased @xmath106-epitaxy ( fig.6 of ref . ) .",
    "these observations indicate that the spin - orbit induced anisotropy in the 3d - orbitals near @xmath4 is smallest , if @xmath1 is aligned parallel to the existing axial perturbation built in by hcp- or @xmath106-epitaxy . in this case",
    ", the 3d - orbitals have already the axial symmetry so that an induced magnetization along the epitaxial ( polar ) direction may have only a moderate effect on the scattering probability into these states .",
    "this is in distinct contrast to the in - plane orientation of @xmath1 which breaks the symmetry of these orbitals .",
    "therefore , the mechanism proposed here for the gse qualifies the film anisotropy of the amr more precisely as structural , rather than as a geometrical effect .",
    "the formation of domains affects the mr s of the 188  nm thick film and of the thinner films , d@xmath107  20  nm , in quite different ways .",
    "the interesting features can already be realized on the large field scale of fig.5 : ( i ) for d=20  nm co ( and also for 10  nm , not shown ) both , the polar and the transverse mr s approach the field - independent longitudinal mr , @xmath108 , whereas the polar and the longitudinal mr s of the 188  nm film tend to the field - independent transverse resistance @xmath109 . in order to provide some solid basis for a detailed discussion of these characteristic features of the domain mr s , we examine the domain structures by magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) .    the essential difference between the thick ( 188  nm ) and the thinner films can be infered from mfm images of the demagnetized states , shown in fig.7a .",
    "the images have been recorded in the dynamic mode of the q - scope which is sensitive to the polar gradient of the polar force , i.e. @xmath110 . the 20  nm film consists of large , some 10  @xmath111 wide domains with in - plane magnetizations separated by 180@xmath112 neel walls .",
    "the domain magnetizations are oriented parallel to the uniaxial anisotropy field @xmath16 as determined by fmr .",
    "a slight longitudinal ripple of @xmath1 about @xmath16 is visible , which most likely arises from the polycrystallinity of the film .    in constrast ,",
    "the 188  nm film exhibits a maze configuration of stripe domains with sizable polar components of the domain magnetizations .",
    "the fourier transform of the image in fig.7a yields a mean width of the stripes , @xmath113  nm , being rather close to the thickness as expected for weak stripes by magnetostatic reasons @xcite .",
    "recently , the same observations were reported for a 195  nm thin _ polycrystalline _",
    "co - film on glass and related to a hexagonal texture perpendicular to film plane@xcite .",
    "mfm images depicted on _ epitaxial _ co - films revealed a reorientation of the domain magnetization from in - plane to polar between 10  nm and 50  nm  @xcite which was explained in terms of the perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy of co. these results suggest that also in our case the hcp texture , realized by the xrd ( fig.1 ) , generates such a crystalline anisotropy , which in the 188  nm film becomes large enough to produce a significant polar component of @xmath1 .",
    "let us also recall that we supposed this texture already in the discussion of the gse .",
    "the other interesting property of these weak stripes is seen in fig.7b . in the remanent states ,",
    "stripe patterns are found aligned with the direction of the previously applied fields @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "this socalled rotable anisotropy can be attributed to the stiffness of the domain walls against deformations  @xcite and is probably supported by a pinning of the walls by local anisotropies in the granular structure .",
    "the rotatable anisotropy suggests also an isotropic hysteresis loop , the shape of which should be independent on the direction of the in - plane field .",
    "in fact , we do observe this feature on the 188  nm film , see fig.9 below , and will refer to it when discussing the mr in the domain state .",
    "we begin with the low - field resistance of the _ thin _ films , exemplified by figs.3a , 5a for d=20  nm : both the transverse and the polar mr s , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , tend to the longitudinal one , @xmath35 .",
    "this behavior is readily explained by the fact that the resistance is measured along @xmath16 , and that at low fields the domain magnetization is also directed parallel to @xmath118 evidenced by mfm ( fig.7a ) .",
    "the parabolic decrease of @xmath119 in larger _ polar _ fields , @xmath120 , was already attributed to the amr resulting from the rotation of @xmath1 from an in - plane to the polar direction .",
    "also the detailed variation of the _ in - plane _",
    "mr s , shown in fig.8a , can be explained by the amr . using the hysteresis loops @xmath121 in fig.8b , and assuming the relations for the angle @xmath41 in equ.2 ,    @xmath122    @xmath123    the in - plane mr can be described rather nicely .",
    "the physical arguments for these agreements are : ( i ) the _ longitudinal _ magnetization process , @xmath124 , is due to the nucleation of 180@xmath112 neel walls ( see fig.7a ) at the coercive field @xmath125 ( determined by fmr ) , which then rapidly cross the film leaving the resistance unchanged ; ( ii ) upon reduction of the _ transverse _ field , on the other hand , a longitudinal ripple of @xmath1 about @xmath126 appears which originates from @xmath16 ( see e.g. ch.5.5 of ref . ) .",
    "accordingly , the components of @xmath1 parallel and antiparallel to the current @xmath127 are growing continuously so that @xmath128 increases until the transverse coercive field @xmath129 is reached .",
    "there the magnetization component along @xmath16 changes sign and increases at the expense of the ripple , so that @xmath128 back to @xmath109 at larger negative fields",
    ".    a rather different behavior is displayed by the 188  nm _ thick _ film .",
    "already in fig.5b we noticed that at low fields the polar and the longitudinal mr s tended to the transverse mr .",
    "as a rather unexpected feature , the transverse mr turned out to be nearly independent of the field also in the domain regime , @xmath130 .",
    "the detailed variation of the in - plane mr s at low fields is shown in fig.9a revealing just the opposite to the behavior of the thin films ( see fig.8a ) : the longitudinal mr displays a strong field dependence , while the transverse mr remains very small . these results are explained also by the amr effect .",
    "the _ in - plane _ mr , shown in fig.9b , is rather nicely reproduced by the solid curves which have also been calculated from equ.2 .",
    "again , the mean angle @xmath41 between current and magnetizations @xmath131 has been determined from equ.9 and the hysteresis loops , fig.9b . as a matter of fact",
    ", we emphasize that the shape of these loops does not depend on the direction of the in - plane field ( rotatable loops ) .",
    "this is consistent with the corresponding behavior of the weak stripe domains depicted by mfm in fig.7b .",
    "in contrast to the thin films , d@xmath10720  nm , no effect by the uniaxial in - plane anisotropy field , @xmath132  oe , determined by fmr  @xcite , is realized . the much larger coercive field , @xmath133  oe , stems most likely from the pinning of the stripe domain walls by the random polycrystalline anisotropy in the films .",
    "aiming at a more detailed description of the mr in the 188  nm film , again the domain structure has to be taken into account .",
    "for this purpose , we use an effective medium model , by which rdiger _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite successfully interpreted the amr of epitaxial co - films . introducing the volume fractions @xmath134 for different domain species ,",
    "the amr is approximated by    @xmath135    here the @xmath136 denote the amr s of the corresponding domain with polar , transverse or longitudinal orientations of @xmath1 relative to current and film plane . by definition",
    "is @xmath137 and if , for convenience , @xmath138 is normalize to the transverse mr , equ.10 takes the form    @xmath139    where @xmath140 denotes the gse - ratio .",
    "the simplest case , @xmath141 and , hence , @xmath142 has been realized on the thin films at low fields .",
    "the most interesting example is the 188  nm film , where ( i ) the low - field mr appears to be inverted relative to the thin films and , moreover , ( ii ) the transverse resistivity remains at the saturation value @xmath143 , even in the domain state .",
    "we will now attempt to relate these striking features displayed by figs.5b , 9 to the domain structure observed by mfm , see fig.7 .",
    "observation ( ii ) in connection with equ.11 implies for the concentration of polar oriented domains , @xmath144 .\\ ] ] below the saturation field , the magnetization @xmath145 and therefore , @xmath146 , starts to decrease at the expense of a finite polar component @xmath147 , which leads to the nucleation of stripe domains . upon further reduction , @xmath148",
    ", the hysteresis loops display a normalized remanent magnetization @xmath149 , i.e. volume fraction @xmath150 . for an estimate",
    ", we take the maximum gse , @xmath151 , to find from equ.11 @xmath152 and by using @xmath153,the same longitudinal volume fraction @xmath154 .",
    "the agreement of both volumes implies that the nucleation of _ polar _ domains is accompanied by the creation of an equal amount of _ longitudinally _ oriented domain .",
    "considering the square - like cross - section of the stripes following from fig.7b , this result indicates that the flux extending from the polar phase is closed by the longitudinal volume @xmath155 .",
    "the rotatable symmetry of the hysteresis loops implies for the longitudinal direction also @xmath156 . for the longitudinal mr",
    "equ.10 predicts then @xmath157 , which is in close agreement with the measured value , see fig.9a .",
    "finally , upon reduction of @xmath158 to the coercive field , @xmath159 increases further .",
    "the volume fraction of the polar domains at @xmath160 can be estimated from the stripe maze of the demagnetized state , fig.7a , which suggests @xmath161 .",
    "then , from equ.11 and simple algebra we obtain @xmath162 .",
    "thus the demagnetized state consist of equal volumes for all six possible magnetization directions , which by considering the symmetry of the stripe structure is again a plausible result .",
    "the magnetoresistance of polycrystalline co - films , which were characterized by xrd , fmr , squid - magnetometry , afm , mfm and temperature variable resistivity , has been investigated in fields up to 100  koe directed along three principal directions . in the saturated state , the mr displayed the socalled geometrical size - effect ( gse ) , according to which the mr for the polar orientation of @xmath1 is up to twice as large as for the in - plane @xmath1 .",
    "the determination of the gse was facilitated by the facts that the spin - wave contributions could be easily subtracted and that in the present disordered films the classical lorentz mr proved to be negligible . basing on a correlation between the gse and a texture detected previously on permalloy films@xcite and also on our co - films by xrd , we proposed to attribute the gse to an anisotropic mixing of the 3d - levels near @xmath4 by the longitudinal part of the spin - orbit interaction . by extending potters@xcite prediction for the amr of the minority spin channel",
    ", we obtained a result which is consistent with the observed upper limit of two for the gse and also with the temperature independence of the gse .",
    "a relation of the gse to the electronic structure has already been conjectured in the literature@xcite , but not yet been worked out . of course , regarding the simplicity of the proposed extension and the assumption of a simple spherical fermi - surface for the final 3d - states in ref .",
    ", which considers only the local aspect of the spin - orbit interaction , these consistencies may be fortuitous .",
    "however , we believe that the central argument for the appearance of the gse , i.e. the presence of an additional uniaxial symmetry in polycrystalline films through a texture in thin films remains valid . hence , a more detailed reasoning for the gse considering also the effect of the spin - orbit interaction on the band - structure is indicated in order to check the present rough model .",
    "the mr s in the _ domain state _ were interpreted using the saturated amr s and the gse , the hysteresis loops , and mfm images of the domain structure . for thin co - films ,",
    "@xmath163 , where the magnetization remained the film - plane and became for @xmath164 parallel to the weak uniaxial anisotropy field , the mr attained the maximum ( longitudinal ) value at zero magnetization .",
    "the mr in the domain state of the thickest film ,",
    "d=188  nm , on the other hand , displayed a rather different behavior .",
    "as a function of the _ transverse _ field in the film - plane , the resistance turned out to be almost constant , whereas upon reducing _",
    "longitudinal _ and _ polar _ fields the resistances decreased and increased , respectively , from their different saturation values to the transverse mr .",
    "mfm images and hysteresis loops revealed the formation of rotatable stripe domains with square cross - section due to the hcp texture . by means of an effective medium",
    "model@xcite , the mr s could be quantitatively explained in terms of a flux closure configuration of the magnetization components about the directions of the stripes .",
    "approaching the coercive field , the stripes terminated in a maze configuration , and the fractional volumes of all three magnetization components proved to be equal . in this model , the surprising field independence of the transverse mr results from the squared corss - section of the stripes with transverse flux - closure and from a gse ratio of two .",
    "we should note that this discussion did not invoke ( possible small ) contributions to the mr by the neel- and bloch - walls in the thin and thick films , respectively .",
    "such effects have been reported before in epitaxial co - films@xcite with strong hcp crystalline anisotropy and quantitatively different domain dimensions .",
