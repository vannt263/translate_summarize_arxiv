    "nilpotent lie groups have long been of interest as a natural setting for the study of subelliptic operators ; indeed , as shown in @xcite , they model , at least locally , a general class of hypoelliptic operators on manifolds .",
    "perhaps the simplest example is the classical heisenberg group of dimension @xmath11 , followed by the higher - dimensional heisenberg or heisenberg - weyl groups of dimension @xmath12 having @xmath13-dimensional centers . beyond this ,",
    "a natural generalization of the heisenberg groups is given by the h - type ( or heisenberg - type ) groups , which were introduced in @xcite ; these have a greater variety of possible dimensions while retaining some fairly strong algebraic structure .",
    "the main result of this paper is found in corollary [ main - corollary ] , in which we establish precise upper and lower pointwise estimates on the subelliptic heat kernel @xmath4 for an h - type group @xmath0 , of the form @xmath14 for some positive constants @xmath7 , @xmath8 and an explicit function @xmath2 , where @xmath5 is the carnot - carathodory distance on @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , in theorem [ main - gradient - theorem ] , we obtain similar bounds for the subriemannian gradient of @xmath15 , namely that @xmath16 for another explicit function @xmath17 , where the inequality is valid at points sufficiently far from the identity of @xmath0 .",
    "estimates of the form ( [ p - bound - intro ] ) for the classical heisenberg group first appeared in @xcite , in the context of a gradient estimate for the heat semigroup , as did an estimate equivalent to the upper bound in ( [ grad - bound - intro ] ) .",
    "a proof for heisenberg groups in all dimensions followed in @xcite .",
    "our proof is similar in spirit to the latter , in that it relies on the analysis of an explicit formula for @xmath4 using steepest descent methods and elementary complex analysis .",

    "all three of these works , like @xcite and the present article , were based on an explicit formula for @xmath4 and involved steepest descent type methods . in @xcite ,",
    "similar techniques were used to obtain a li - yau - harnack inequality for the heat equation on heisenberg groups .",

    "in particular , it makes sense for all @xmath89 , whether or not an h - type group of the corresponding dimension actually exists ( which can be ascertained via theorem [ dimension - classification ] ) .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ main - theorem ] and [ main - gradient - theorem ] do not depend on the values of @xmath64 and @xmath58 , so they likewise remain valid for all @xmath89 .",
    "the estimates given are in terms of the distance function @xmath5 , which likewise should be taken as a function defined by the formula ( [ distance - formula ] ) . indeed , the only place where we need @xmath15 to be a heat kernel is in the proof of corollary [ main - corollary ] , where we use the positivity of @xmath15 which follows from the general theory .",
    "in particular , in section [ hadamard - sec ] we shall make use of estimates on @xmath15 for values of @xmath89 not necessarily corresponding to h - type groups .",
    "the proofs of these two theorems are broken into two cases , depending on the relative sizes of @xmath425 and @xmath426 .",

    "even can be deduced from that for @xmath58 odd by a hadamard descent approach , which is contained in section [ hadamard - sec ] .",
    "we first handle the region where @xmath451 for some constant @xmath452 . if @xmath453 is as in theorem [ distance ] , this implies @xmath454 ; since @xmath305 increases on @xmath153 we have @xmath455 in this region .",
    "note also that by corollary [ distance - estimate ] we have @xmath456 , as well as @xmath457 which is clear from ( [ distance - formula ] ) .",

    "our approach here will be a steepest descent argument .",
    "very informally , the motivation is as follows : given a function @xmath460 , move the contour of integration to a new contour @xmath461 which passes through a critical point @xmath462 of @xmath115 , so that @xmath463",
    ". then we have @xmath464 for large @xmath465 the integrand looks like a gaussian concentrated near @xmath462 , so @xmath466 .",

    "let @xmath476 denote the branch of the square root function satisfying @xmath477 and @xmath478 for @xmath479 ( so the branch cut is the positive real axis ) .",
    "thus if @xmath480 is an analytic even function , @xmath481 is analytic as well , and satisfies @xmath482 for @xmath474 .",
