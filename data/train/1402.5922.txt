    "consider modal logic as given by atomic propositions , boolean operations , and a unary box , together with its usual axiomatisation stating that box preserves finite meets . in  @xcite ,",
    "dunn answered the question of an axiomatisation of the positive fragment of this logic , where the positive fragment is given by atomic propositions , lattice operations , and unary box and diamond ( but no negation ) .    here",
    "we seek to generalize this result from kripke frames to coalgebras for a weak pullback preserving functor . whereas dunn had no need to justify that the positive fragment actually _ adds _ a modal operator ( the diamond ) , the general situation requires a conceptual clarification of this step . and , as it turns out , what looks innocent enough in the familiar case is at the heart of the general construction .    in the general case , we start with a functor @xmath4 . from @xmath5",
    "we can obtain by duality a functor @xmath6 on the category @xmath7 of boolean algebras , so that the free @xmath8-algebras are exactly the lindenbaum algebras of the modal logic .",
    "we are going to take the functor @xmath8 itself as the category theoretic counterpart of the corresponding modal logic .",
    "how should we construct the positive @xmath5-logic ?",
    "dunn gives us a hint in that he notes that in the same way as standard modal logic is given by algebras over @xmath7 , positive modal logic is given by algebras over the category @xmath9 of ( bounded ) distributive lattices .",
    "it follows that the positive fragment of ( the logic corresponding to ) @xmath8 should be a functor @xmath10 which , in turn , by duality , should arise from a functor @xmath11 on the category @xmath1 of posets and monotone maps .",
    "the centrepiece of our construction is now the observation that any functor @xmath4 has a universal extension to a functor @xmath11 .",
    "theorem  [ mainthm ] then shows that this construction @xmath12 indeed gives the positive fragment of @xmath8 and so generalizes dunn s theorem .",
    "an important observation about the positive fragment is the following : given any boolean formula , we can rewrite it as a positive formula with negation appearing only on atomic propositions . in other words ,",
    "the translation @xmath13 from positive logic to boolean logic given by @xmath14 induces a bijection ( on equivalence classes of formulas taken up to logical equivalence ) .",
    "more algebraically , we can formulate this as follows .",
    "given a boolean algebra @xmath15 , let @xmath16 be the free boolean algebra generated by the set @xmath17 modulo the axioms of modal logic . given a distributive lattice @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be the free distributive lattice generated by @xmath20 modulo the axioms of positive modal logic .",
    "further , let us denote by @xmath21 the forgetful functor .",
    "then the above observation that every modal formula can be written , up to logical equivalence , as a positive modal formula with negations pushed to atoms , can be condensed into the statement that the ( natural ) distributive lattice homomorphism @xmath22 induced by  equations  - is an isomorphism .",
    "our main results , presented in sections  [ sec : poscoalglog ] and [ sec : monotone_predicate_liftings ] , are the following .",
    "if @xmath23 is an extension of @xmath5 and @xmath24 are the induced logics , then @xmath25 exists . if , moreover , @xmath23 is the induced extension ( posetification ) of @xmath5 and @xmath5 preserves weak pullbacks , then @xmath13 is an isomorphism ( theorem  [ mainthm ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the same way as the induced logic @xmath8 can be seen as the logic of all predicate liftings of @xmath5 , the induced logic @xmath26 is the logic of all _ monotone _ predicate liftings of @xmath5 ( theorem  [ thm : mon - lift ] ) .",
    "these results depend crucially on the fact that the posetification @xmath23 of @xmath5 is defined as a completion with respect to @xmath1-enriched colimits .",
    "we devote section  [ sec : pos - functors ] to establishing some results on posetifications used later .",
    "we show that posetifications always exists ( theorem  [ thm : posetification ] ) .",
    "moreover , we characterize those functors @xmath3 that arise as posetifications as the functors that preserve coinserters of ` truncated nerves of posets ' and discrete posets ( theorem  [ thm : pres - nerves ] ) .",
    "we also establish properties of posetifications needed in section  [ sec : poscoalglog ] , for example , that a functor @xmath27 preserves weak pullbacks if and only if its posetification preserves exact squares ( theorem  [ thm : wpb_exsq ] ) .",
    "on the algebraic side , the move to @xmath1-enriched colimits guarantees that the modal operations are monotone . in section  [ ak ] , and",
    "recalling  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.7 ) stating that a functor @xmath10 preserves ordinary sifted colimits if and only if it has a presentation by operations and equations , we show that @xmath10 preserves _ enriched _ sifted colimits if and only if it has a presentation by _ monotone _ operations and equations ( theorem  [ thm : presentmonop ] ) . to see",
    "the relevance of a presentation result specific to monotone operations , observe that in the example of positive modal logic it is indeed the case that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are monotone .",
    "from the point of view of category theory the results of sections  [ sec : pos - functors ] and [ ak ] are of independent interest .",
    "in addition to what we already discussed , we introduce the concept of functors @xmath3 with presentations in discrete arities .",
    "they generalise posetifications and are functors that arise as left kan extensions of functors @xmath30 along the discrete functor @xmath31 .",
    "they are characterised as those functors preserving coinserters of ` truncated nerves of posets ' ( theorem  [ thm : discretearities ] ) .",
    "an important property of @xmath1-functors with presentations in discrete arities is that  like @xmath0-functors but unlike general @xmath1-functors  they preserve surjections ( proposition  [ prop : t-pres - monot - surj ] ) .    *",

    "a kripke model @xmath32 ( see e.g. @xcite for an introduction to modal logic ) with @xmath33 and @xmath34 can also be described as a coalgebra @xmath35 , where @xmath36 stands for the powerset of @xmath37 .",
    "this point of view suggests to generalize modal logic from kripke frames to coalgebras @xmath38 where @xmath5 may now be any functor @xmath4 , see @xcite for an introduction .",
    "we recover kripke models by putting @xmath39 .",
    "we also recover the so - called bounded morphisms or p - morphisms as coalgebras morphisms @xmath40 , that is , as maps @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "more generally , for any category @xmath43 and any functor @xmath44 , we have the category @xmath45 of @xmath5-coalgebras with objects and morphisms as above .",
    "dually , @xmath46 is the category where the objects @xmath47 are arrows in @xmath43 and where the morphisms @xmath48 are arrows @xmath41 in @xmath43 such that @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath5-coalgebras over @xmath43 are dual to @xmath50-algebras over @xmath51 , that is , @xmath52 .",
    "here @xmath51 is the category which has the same objects and arrows as @xmath43 but domain and codomain of arrows interchanged and @xmath53 is the functor that has the same action on objects and morphisms as @xmath5 .",
    "the abstract duality between algebras and coalgebras becomes particularly interesting if we put it on top of a concrete duality , such as the dual adjunction between the category @xmath0 of sets and functions and the category @xmath7 of boolean algebras .",
    "we denote by @xmath54 the functor taking powersets and by @xmath55 the functor taking ultrafilters .",
    "alternatively , we can describe these functors by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which also determines their action on arrows ( here @xmath58 denotes the two - element boolean algebra ) . @xmath59 and @xmath60 are adjoint , satisfying @xmath61 . restricting @xmath60 and @xmath59 to finite boolean algebras / sets , this adjunction becomes a dual equivalence  ( * ? ? ?",

    "we follow a well - established methodology in modal logic  @xcite and study modal logics via the associated category @xmath62 of modal algebras . in modal logic , major milestones",
    "are @xcite and @xcite . in computer science",
    ", we have the seminal work on domain theory in logical form @xcite .",
    "more formally , given a modal logic @xmath63 extending boolean propositional logic with its category @xmath62 of modal algebras , we describe @xmath63 by a functor @xmath64 so that the category @xmath65 of algebras for the functor @xmath8 coincides with @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , the lindenbaum algebra of @xmath63 will be the initial @xmath8-algebra .",

    "the semantics of such a logic is described by a natural transformation @xmath70 intuitively , each modal operator in @xmath71 is assigned its meaning as a subset of @xmath72 .",
    "more formally , @xmath73 allows us to lift @xmath74 to a functor @xmath75 if we consider a formula @xmath76 to be an element of the initial @xmath8-algebra ( the lindenbaum algebra of the logic ) , then the semantics @xmath77\\!]}_{(x,\\xi)}\\ ] ] of @xmath76 as a subset of a coalgebra @xmath78 is given by the unique arrow from that initial algebra to @xmath79 .",
    "this account of the semantics of modal logic is typical for the coalgebraic approach : one first defines a one - step semantics @xmath73 mapping formulas with precisely one layer of modal operators ( as described by @xmath8 ) to one - step - transitions on the semantic side ( as described by @xmath5 )",
    ". then one uses ( co)induction to extend the ` one - step situation ' to arbitrary formulas and behaviors .",
    "[ exle : deltalpcal ] for the logic @xmath6 from example  [ exle : lpcal ] and the powerset functor @xmath80 we define the ( one - step ) semantics @xmath81 by @xmath82 it is an old result in domain theory that @xmath83 is an isomorphism for finite @xmath84 , see  @xcite .",
    "this implies completeness of the axioms   with respect to kripke semantics  .      two important properties of logics , with respect to their coalgebraic semantics , that can be discussed parametrically in @xmath5 , @xmath8 and the semantics @xmath70 are completeness and expressiveness .",
    "the logic given by @xmath85 is _ complete _ if @xmath86\\!]}_{(x,\\xi)}\\subseteq{[\\![\\psi]\\!]}_{(x,\\xi)}$ ] for all coalgebras @xmath87 implies that @xmath88 holds in the initial @xmath8-algebra .",
    "the logic is _ expressive _ if for any two elements of a coalgebra @xmath87 which are not bisimilar , there is a formula that separates them .    in the duality approach to logics",
    "as exemplified by work such as goldblatt s  @xcite in modal modal logic and abramsky s  @xcite in domain theory , completeness and expressiveness follow immediately if @xmath73 is an isomorphism .",
    "since in that work the modal algebras and the coalgebras are based on dually equivalent categories , such as boolean algebras and stone spaces ( or distributive lattices and priestley spaces ) , the requirement that @xmath73 is an isomorphism is reasonable .    in our setting ,",
    "the situation is different since we only have an adjunction , not an equivalence , relating @xmath7 and @xmath0 ( or @xmath9 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "one of the consequences is that @xmath73 typically fails to be an isomorphism and the best we can usually expect is to have @xmath83 an isomorphism for _ finite _ @xmath84 .",
    "but , as it turns out , under relatively mild conditions on the functors @xmath5 and @xmath8 involved , one can show that the logic @xmath8 is complete if and only if @xmath73 is injective  @xcite , and that @xmath8 is expressive if the adjoint transpose @xmath89 of @xmath73 is injective  @xcite or , in the case of @xmath1 , an embedding @xcite .",
    "we will pick up this discussion again at the end of .",
    "given that the notion of functor is axiomatic and rather abstract , the question arises which functors @xmath6 can legitimately be considered to be a modal logic . for us , in this paper , the requirement on @xmath8 is that @xmath8 has a presentation by operations and equations @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this notion in detail in section  [ sec : pos - functors ] , for now it is enough to recall an example .",
    "for a presentation @xmath90 of @xmath7 we let @xmath91 and @xmath92 the usual equations of boolean algebra . for a presentation @xmath93 of the functor @xmath6 from example  [ exle : lpcal ]",
    "we let @xmath94 and @xmath95 the equations .",
    "the first reason why the notion of a presentation of a functor is important to us is the following . if @xmath93 is a presentation of @xmath8 by operations @xmath96 and equations @xmath95 and if @xmath97 is a presentation of @xmath7 then @xmath65 is presented by @xmath98 in such a situation , the logical description of @xmath8-algebra is obtained in a modular way from the logical description of the base category @xmath7 and the logical description of the functor @xmath8 .",
    "we call the elements of @xmath96 _ modal operators _ and the elements of @xmath95 _ modal axioms _ or just axioms .",
    "the second reason is that the class of functors having presentations can be captured in a purely semantic way : a functor @xmath8 has a presentation by operations and equations if and only if @xmath8 is determined by its action on finitely generated free algebras , if and only if @xmath8 preserves sifted colimits , see  @xcite .",
    "we shall give more details on sifted colimits in section  [ sec : sifted ] below .",
    "most succinctly , endofunctors of @xmath7 having presentations by operations and equations are precisely those that arise as _ left kan extensions _ of their restrictions along the inclusion functor @xmath99 of the full subcategory @xmath100 of @xmath7 consisting of free algebras on finitely many generators .",
    "the question considered in this paragraph is : given the coalgebra - type @xmath5 , how can we define the logic @xmath101 of @xmath5 ? as there are many different logics @xmath8 for @xmath5 , we shall use @xmath101 for _ the _ logic of @xmath5 , that is , the strongest logic that captures all aspects of @xmath5 that can be expressed by a finitary boolean logic .",
    "the general considerations laid out above suggest that in order to define the finitary ( boolean ) coalgebraic logic associated to a given functor @xmath4 one first puts @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the free boolean algebra over @xmath104 generators , for @xmath104 ranging over natural numbers .",
    "the functor @xmath105 is then defined as a left kan extension .",
    "the semantics @xmath106 is given by observing that natural transformations @xmath107 are in bijection with natural transformations @xmath108 and we can let @xmath109 to be the identity on finitely generated free algebras .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath110 can be represented as the free boolean algebra on the set @xmath111 modulo appropriate axioms .",
    "the semantics @xmath112 is given by putting @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the adjoint transpose of @xmath115 , with @xmath116 being the familiar adjunction .",
    "it is worth noting that the elements in @xmath117 are , by the yoneda lemma , in one - to - one correspondence with natural transformations @xmath118 .",
    "the latter natural transformations are also known as _ predicate liftings _",
    "hence we see that the logic @xmath101 coincides with the logic of all predicate liftings of  @xcite , with the difference that the functor @xmath101 also incorporates a complete set of axioms .",
    "the axioms are important to us as otherwise the natural transformation @xmath13 mentioned in the introduction , see  equation  , might not exist .    of course , in concrete examples one is often able to obtain much more succinct presentations :    [ prop : mathbf l ] for @xmath5 the powerset functor , the functor @xmath101 defined by  equation   is isomorphic to the functor @xmath8 of example  [ exle : lpcal ] .    in analogy with  equation  ,",
    "let @xmath119 be the transpose of @xmath120 as defined in  equation  .",
    "we know from example  [ exle : deltalpcal ] that @xmath121 is an isomorphism .",
    "but as both @xmath8 and @xmath101 are determined by their action on finitely generated free algebras , this extends to an isomorphisn @xmath122 .",
    "the functor @xmath101 is universal in the sense that any other finitary boolean coalgebraic logic @xmath8 for @xmath5 is uniquely determined by the natural transformation @xmath123 constructed in the proof above .",
    "more formally , we can express this universality as follows : denote by @xmath124 $ ] the category of sifted - colimit - preserving functors from @xmath7 to @xmath7 and by @xmath125 the inclusion @xmath124\\to[{\\mathsf{ba } } , { \\mathsf{ba}}]$ ] .",
    "then @xmath126 as given in  equation   is a final object in the comma category @xmath127 .",
    "proposition  [ prop : mathbf l ] can then be understood as saying that the logic defined by finality as above has a simple concrete presentation given by  equations  - .",
    "it is evident that , at least for some of the developments above , not only the functor @xmath5 , but also the categories @xmath0 and @xmath7 can be considered to be parameters .",
    "accordingly , one expects that positive coalgebraic logic takes place over the category @xmath9 of ( bounded ) distributive lattices which in turn , is part of an adjunction @xmath128 , taking upsets , and @xmath129 , taking prime filters , or , equivalently , @xmath130 and @xmath131 where @xmath58 is , as before , the two - element chain ( now considered , depending on the context , either as a poset or as a distributive lattice ) .",
    "consequently , the ` natural semantics ' of positive logics is ` ordered kripke frames ' , or coalgebras over posets .",
    "one side of this argument is formal : coalgebras over @xmath1 are to logics over @xmath9 what coalgebras over @xmath0 are to logics over @xmath7 .",
    "another side of the argument goes as follows : to provide the semantics for a logic without negation , we need to distinguish between sets and their complements .",
    "this is most easily done by stipulating that the semantics of formulas is given by upward closed sets with respect to some order , as the complements then are downward closed sets .",
    "replaying the developments above with @xmath1 and @xmath9 instead of @xmath0 and @xmath7 , we may define a logic for @xmath23-coalgebras , with @xmath11 , to be given by a natural transformation @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a functor determined _ by its action on finitely discretely generated free distributive lattices _ , namely @xmath134 and @xmath135 is given by its transpose in the same way as in  equation  .",
    "here , @xmath136 denotes the functor equipping a set with the discrete order , and @xmath137 is the functor mapping a poset to the free distributive lattice on it .",
    "[ exle : lpcal ]    given a poset @xmath84 , a subset @xmath138 is called _ convex _ if @xmath139 and @xmath140 imply @xmath141 .",
    "the _ convex powerset functor _",
    "@xmath142 maps a poset to the set of its convex subsets , ordered by the egli - milner order , and a monotone map to its direct image .",
    "let now @xmath10 be the functor mapping a distributive lattice @xmath18 to the distributive lattice @xmath143 generated by @xmath67 and @xmath144 for all @xmath68 , and subject to the relations stipulating that @xmath28 preserves finite meets , @xmath29 preserves finite joins , and that the inequalities @xmath145 hold .",
    "the natural transformation @xmath146 is defined by putting @xmath147 the clause for @xmath67 being the same as in  equation  .",
    "@xmath148 is the category of positive modal algebras of dunn  @xcite .",
    "we shall later see in corollary  [ cor : lisboldl ] that it is isomorphic to @xmath149 .",
    "we have again that for a finite poset @xmath84 , @xmath150 is an isomorphism , a representation first stated in  @xcite , the connection with modal logic being given by  @xcite and investigated from a coalgebraic point of view in  @xcite . as opposed to @xcite , we take the set - theoretic semantics of modal logic as fundamental .",
    "we therefore do not have to use the topological semantics based on stone or priestley duality : all we need is contained in the adjunctions @xmath151 and @xmath152 .      moving from ordinary categories to categories enriched over @xmath1 plays a major role in this paper .",
    "the reason is that enrichment over @xmath1 takes automatically care of the fact that positive modal logics extend the logic of distributive lattices by _",
    "modal operations .",
    "this is crucial from the point of view of our main application , namely positive modal logic .    throughout the paper , however , we shall encounter many more reasons why to move to an enriched setting .",
    "some of the reasons are the following .    1 .",
    "the category @xmath1 is the cocompletion under _ enriched _ sifted colimits of the category of finite sets .",
    "the posetification , to be locally monotone , must be defined as an _ enriched _ left kan extension .",
    "3 .   among all functors on @xmath1 ,",
    "posetifications are characterized by ` coinserters of truncated nerves ' where a coinserter is the enriched analogue of a coequalizer .",
    "4 .   in the ordered setting ,",
    "one is frequently interested in definability by inequations ( @xmath153 ) instead of definability by equations : quotienting by inequations corresponds to taking a coinserter instead of a coequalizer .",
    "5 .   having a presentation by _",
    "monotone _ operations and equations in _ discrete arities _ is characterized by preservation of _ enriched _ sifted colimits .",
    "below we recall some notions of enriched category theory needed in the sequel .",
    "most of this section is rather technical , but we have decided to include it in order to keep the paper self - contained . however , for more details , we refer the reader to kelly s monograph  @xcite .",
    "the category @xmath1 has partial orders ( posets ) as objects and monotone maps as arrows .",
    "@xmath1 is complete and cocomplete ( even locally finitely presentable  @xcite ) .",
    "limits are computed as in @xmath0 , with the order on the limit being the largest relation making the maps in the cocone monotone .",
    "colimits are easiest to compute in two steps .",
    "first , colimits in the category of preorders are computed as in @xmath0 , with the preorder on the colimit being the smallest one making the maps in the cocone monotone .",
    "second , one quotients the preorder by anti - symmetry in order to obtain a poset ( directed colimits , however , are computed as in @xmath0 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath1 is also cartesian closed , with the internal hom @xmath154 $ ] being the poset of monotone maps from @xmath84 to @xmath155 , ordered pointwise .",
    "we shall consider categories _ enriched _ in @xmath1 .",
    "thus , a @xmath1-enriched category @xmath43 is a category with ordered homsets , such that composition is monotone in both arguments : @xmath156 whenever @xmath157 and @xmath158 ; a @xmath1-enriched functor @xmath159 is a _ locally monotone _ functor , that is , it preserves the order on the homsets : @xmath160 implies @xmath161 .",
    "a @xmath1-natural transformation between locally monotone functors is just a natural transformation , the extra condition of enriched naturality being vacuous here .",
    "consequently , a @xmath1-adjunction between two @xmath1-categories is just an ordinary adjunction between two locally monotone functors .",

    ", unless it is necessary to emphasize the distinction between them . in such case , the ordinary category will be denoted by @xmath165 , and we proceed similarly for @xmath1-functors .",
    "besides @xmath1 itself , an example of a @xmath1-enriched category is @xmath0 , the category of sets and functions , considered discretely enriched . in the chain @xmath166 of adjunctions between the connected components functor , the discrete functor and the forgetful one , only the adjunction @xmath167 is enriched ; in particular the discrete functor @xmath136 is locally monotone , while the forgetful functor @xmath168 fails to be so .",
    "observe also that , due to the discrete enrichment , _ any _ functor @xmath169 is automatically locally monotone .",
    "recall from  @xcite that the proper concepts of limits and colimits in enriched category theory are those of _ weighted _ ( co)limits . specifically , the _ colimit _ of a @xmath1 functor @xmath170 weighted by a @xmath1-functor @xmath171 is an object @xmath172 in @xmath43 , together with an isomorphism @xmath173(\\varphi , \\k(g- , x))\\ ] ] of posets , natural in @xmath84 in @xmath43 .",
