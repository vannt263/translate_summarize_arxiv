    "* and references therein ) , crossing the instability strip as they move bluewards in the hertzprung - russell ( hr ) diagram ( _ blue loop _ excursion ) at constant luminosity for each given mass .",
    "thus , stellar evolution predicts a mass - luminosity relation ( mlr ) for classical cepheids .",
    "this mlr , combined with the period - density relation and the stefan boltzmann law , produces a plc relation , holding for each individual cepheid ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "on this basis , the investigation of cepheid pulsation properties is also crucial for providing independent constraints on the mlr .",
    "several authors have discussed the uncertainties related to this mlr as due to core overshooting and/or mass loss ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these authors noticed that the cepheid _ evolutionary _ masses based on the application of theoretical isochrones to observations were larger than the _ pulsational _ ones , e.g. based on period  mass  radius relations @xcite .",
    "one of the methods that has been recently adopted by our team to address the mass discrepancy problem is the so called model fitting of multi - filter light , radial velocity and radius curves ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the adopted nonlinear convective pulsation models reproduced the luminosity variation over the entire pulsation cycle if the adopted stellar mass for both cepheids was roughly 15% smaller than predicted by evolutionary models neglecting mass loss and convective core overshooting .",
    "moreover , the model fitting procedure provided a distance modulus to the lmc of 18.53@xmath30.05 mag .",
    "this value was in excellent agreement with the results based on the model fitting technique applied by other teams ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) to lmc cepheids from the macho @xcite database , as well as with the distance obtained from application of the model fitting technique to rr lyrae @xcite or @xmath2 scuti @xcite pulsators . * in @xcite",

    "again , the inferred stellar parameters corresponded to a mlr slightly brighter than the canonical one , as an effect of mild overshooting and/or mass loss , and to individual distances consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "the resulting mean distance modulus ( 18.56 @xmath3 0.03 ( stat ) @xmath3 0.1 ( syst ) mag ) , was found to be in agreement with the literature , as well as with the previous model fitting applications . * in @xcite we fitted the light and radial velocity curves of the lmc cepheid ogle - lmc - cep-0227 belonging to a detached double - lined eclipsing binary system , finding , for the best fitting model , a pulsation mass , a mean effective temperature , a luminosity amplitude and a mean radius in agreement with the empirical estimates .",
