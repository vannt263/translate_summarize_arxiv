    "@xmath51    one has to stress that it is impossible to put @xmath52 close to @xmath24 because we consider the supercritical droplets .",
    "moreover when @xmath52 goes to @xmath24 one can expect divergence of @xmath53 .",
    "fortunately this divergence is rather weak .",
    "it will be discussed later .",
    "another reason to forbid the small values of @xmath52 is that in this process one can not attain @xmath54 in principle .",
    "what shall we do with the totally dissolved embryo ?",
    "this is the necessary disadvantage of the approach used here .",
    "so , one has to take @xmath52 greater than @xmath55 .",
    "the last value ensured the necessary accuracy and negligible intensity of the process of dissolution .",
    "let the characteristic size of the cluster be @xmath56 molecules .",
    "let the supersaturation be @xmath57 ( during the nucleation period it falls but not so essentially , so one can take the characteristic value ) .",
    "we start at @xmath58 and try to attain @xmath56 .",
    "we calculate the time necessary to attain it according to macroscopic regular law in continuous approximation @xmath59 ( in corresponding time units ) and get @xmath60 .",
    "then we recalculate the time according to regular law with discrete jumps @xmath61 and get @xmath62 .",
    "the value @xmath63 has to be corrected up to the integer number of elementary time intervals @xmath4 . in this example @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath48 will be slightly another .",
    "it is more profitable to fulfil the simple simulation of regular growth . at every step",
    "@xmath4 instead of @xmath1 we get @xmath65 . the final value will be marked as @xmath66 .",
    "this way allows to estimate the deviation caused by the finite value of @xmath4 .",
    "the general result of simulations is that the value @xmath66 is practically the same as @xmath27 .    to note the difference between these values one has to see that latexmath:[\\[\\label{tty }    @xmath19 .",
    "now we turn to the dispersion",
    ". the mean number of events can be estimated as @xmath68 so , the estimate for the mean standard deviation of the size @xmath1 from the mean value @xmath27 in a particular attempt will be @xmath69 namely , @xmath70    numerical simulations give @xmath71 .",
    "the discrepancy will be a matter of discussions .    for the final values we have the following results @xmath72 @xmath73 to ensure that @xmath74 we fulfilled @xmath75 attempts .",
    "formally the necessary inequalities ( [ tty ] ) are satisfied . but still this discrepancy can be the result of small errors in simulation",
    ". really , the random number generators are not so perfect .",
    "also there has to be a special correction caused by the prescribed sequence of possible adsorption and ejection events .",
    "this weak correlation remained without our attention .",
    "certainly , the deviation in the mean coordinate is out of practical interest .",
    "it is much more interesting to consider the deviation in dispersion .",
    "to see that @xmath76 we start from the master equation in fokker - planck approximation for the partial distribution function @xmath77 over size @xmath1 : @xmath78\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the formal equilibrium distribution .",
    "the last equation is valid for small values of supersaturation .    from the equation of detailed balance",
    "it follows that @xmath80 since @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the free energy of the embryo , one can get explicit kinetic equation on @xmath77 .    in the cappilary approximation @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a scaled surface tension .    for the supercritical embryos @xmath85    taking into account that @xmath86 , @xmath87 and acting in a scale where @xmath88 one can get @xmath89    the next step is to note that asymptotically at @xmath90 @xmath91    since the initial condition is @xmath92 one can suppose that @xmath93 then the kinetic equation ( [ pp ] ) can be written as @xmath94    the second term @xmath95 can be comparable with the fist term @xmath96 only when @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the stationary flow .",
    "but here we consider the growth of a single droplet , the situation is opposite and the true initial condition is @xmath99 so , here the second term can be neglected and the relation ( [ rr ] ) can be justified .",
    "now we can see that having neglected @xmath100 in kinetic equation one can reduce it to @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "we see that the last equation is the ordinary diffusion equation with constant velocity of regular growth and the coefficient @xmath103 of diffusion along @xmath104-axis written as @xmath105 since @xmath103 is a decreasing function , one can see that the distribution function over @xmath1 ( as a function of @xmath104 ) will be a well localized function in @xmath104-scale ( and , hence , in @xmath1-scale ) .",
    "so , the characteristic relative width of @xmath77 will be small .",
    "this conclusion will also lead to the self consistency of negligible character of the second term in kinetic equation .    under the constant value of @xmath103 the characteristic width",
    "@xmath106 will have an order @xmath107 and the characteristic value of @xmath104 is many times greater than the characteristic width .",
    "here the situation leads to a more strong inequality .    to see the effects of stochastic growth one can also calculate the derivative @xmath108 .",
    "the expression is the following @xmath109 then @xmath110 or @xmath111 note that we have to use namely precise equation ( [ pp ] ) without transformation ( [ rr ] ) .",
    "if we use ( [ rr ] ) we get the additional wrong factor @xmath112 .",
    "the first integral @xmath113 corresponds to the regular growth and the second integral @xmath114 represents corrections .",
    "one can see that integration by parts gives @xmath115 since @xmath77 is well localized in a relatively small region @xmath116 can be presented as @xmath117 and it is rather small in comparison with @xmath118 which can be estimated as @xmath119    so , the smallness of correction to the mean coordinate is proven analytically .",
    "one has to note that the mentioned conclusion is rather typical for the processes of such kind .",
    "we can make our arguments more strong if we recall the uhlenbeck process .",
    "one can note that for the uhlenbeck process @xmath120 with two parameters @xmath121 and @xmath122 the green s function is known and has the exponent form : @xmath123 this exponent form lies in correspondence with the absence of correction to the regular growth .",
    "really , @xmath124 since @xmath125 .",
    "then @xmath126 with arbitrary @xmath127 .",
    "the coordinate of the regular growth @xmath127 will be @xmath128 .",
    "then the green s function is the gaussian symmetrical on @xmath129 . then @xmath130 . as the result",
    "the first term @xmath131 describes the regular evolution and the second term @xmath132 is absent .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the green s function is known here .    in our process",
    "the analogous property is absent .",
    "but the last example shows that at least the effects of the difference between @xmath133 and @xmath134 are moderate because in situations @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( our situation lies between these laws ) they are absent .",
    "the next task is to calculate dispersion @xmath53 as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath52 . here",
    "there is no need to average over such a giant number of attempts , it is quite sufficient to take @xmath137 attempts to get suitable result for dispersion .",
    "the results of simulation are the following :    * for @xmath138 one can see in the figure 1 the following dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath48 +    +   dispersions for @xmath138 as a function of @xmath139 + one can see that it can be approximately the straight line @xmath140 * for @xmath141 one can see the analogous dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath48 drawn in figure 2 +    +   dispersions for @xmath141 as a function of @xmath139 + one can see that it is also approximately the straight line @xmath142    the result of these two numerical pictures is that one can not say that the fluctuations disappear when @xmath1 goes to infinity .",
    "the result is that @xmath143    the direct sequence is that one has to take fluctuation effects of growth into account .",
    "fortunately , the true result is a little bit more optimistic . in reality",
    "@xmath144 becomes small for enough big @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely the result of mentioned simulations give @xmath145 where @xmath146    it can be seen from corresponding pictures drawn in logarithmic scales .",
    "the following figure 3 shows the dependence of @xmath147 on @xmath1 for @xmath138         logarithm of dispersions for @xmath138 as a function of @xmath148    the linear approximation @xmath149 is also drawn .",
    "the same dependence for @xmath150 is drawn in figure 4         logarithm of dispersions for @xmath141 as a function of @xmath148    the best linear approximation @xmath151 is also drawn .",
    "so , the convergence @xmath152 formally takes place .",
    "but for every concrete ( finite ) situation one has to take this correction into account .",
    "here we are interested in the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath48 . this dependence will be like a power one and the value of the power has to be determined",
    ".    the starting point of explanation will be equation ( [ r ] ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath153 has a singularity at @xmath154 .",
    "certainly , @xmath154 is out of range of consideration .",
    "at least @xmath155 is a rapidly decreasing function .",
    "it means that the main blurring takes place in initial period of time of growth ( i.e. some @xmath156 has been formed ) and later this blurring is mainly translated along @xmath1-scale .",
    "it is rather easy to estimate the role of translation .",
    "really , due to translation @xmath157 since the value of initial dispersion @xmath106 is fixed we come to the power like dependence @xmath158 the power is @xmath159 .",
    "one has also to consider the standard diffusion of purely independent events with blurring in the @xmath104 scale .",
    "this leads to @xmath160 .",
    "then @xmath161    the power like dependence together with scaling invariancy means that some fixed part of evolution forms the dispersion @xmath162 . for",
    "this value one can take @xmath163    since @xmath164 , where @xmath10 is some fixed parameter , one can come to @xmath165 and @xmath166    numerical simulations confirm this result .",
    "the problem of establishing the dependence of @xmath19 is not yet solved because there exists the uncomfortable dependence of @xmath53 on the starting size @xmath52 .",
    "one can not put @xmath52 to zero and solve this problem because in numerical simulation one has to exclude the dissolution of embryos .    the simulations with finite @xmath52 shows the irregular behavior of @xmath19 for small @xmath1 .",
    "seeking for the power like dependence we shall draw curves in logarithmic scales .",
    "the dependence of @xmath147 on @xmath167 is drawn in figure 5 for @xmath56 and figure 6 for @xmath168         logarithm of dispersions for @xmath56 as a function of @xmath169         logarithm of dispersions for @xmath168 as a function of @xmath169    the straight lines drawn in these figures are the following    * in figure 5 @xmath170 * in figure 6 @xmath171",
    "again we are seeking for the power in the power like dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath52 .",
    "having noticed that @xmath172 we can rewrite this equation as @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the moment corresponding to @xmath104 .",
    "we see that @xmath155 is mainly concentrated in initial moments of time .",
    "this allows us to state that approximately @xmath175    having calculated the last integral and interested in behavior at the lower limit of integration we come to @xmath176    in terms of @xmath177 one can rewrite the last equation as @xmath178    the numerical results confirm in general features the small negative value of the power . but",
    "the some discrepancy between theoretical model and results of simulation still remains .",
    "then we have to use the ideas of the self - similarity .",
    "there is no difference between @xmath52 and @xmath48 . really , the value @xmath52 is the final value for the region @xmath179 $ ] which is out of consideration .",
    "the dispersion was supposed to be like @xmath180 .",
    "but since @xmath52 can be interpreted as a final size , we know that dispersion really will be @xmath181 .    then we have to increase the power of the previous result in @xmath182 times .",
    "this leads to @xmath183*(1/6 ) } = \\nu^{-5/18}\\ ] ]    then the coincidence between theoretical and experimental results becomes satisfactory .",
    "since the functional dependence on @xmath52 and on @xmath48 have been determined we do nt know only the numerical coefficient in the formula @xmath184 this coefficient can be determined by the unique computer simulation or by application of analytical model to one of the concrete situations .    here",
    "we shall show no more than an illustrative example of calculations .",
    "the weak feature is that it does not correspond to all approaches used above .",
    "let us choose the situation used in simulations for the mean value .",
    "the value of dispersion has to be calculated as following :    * the moments of time @xmath185 and @xmath186 have to be determined .",
    "* dispersion in @xmath104 scale is @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the effective total number of events .",
    "it cam be approximately calculated according to the following formula @xmath189to have an analogy with @xmath190 in a case @xmath191 . having used ( [ difco ] ) and keeping in mind @xmath192 we come to @xmath193 * dispersion in @xmath1 scale will be @xmath194 after substitution of ( [ t0 ] ) and ( [ tf ] ) we come to @xmath195 * it is quite evident that the dispersion of self blurring @xmath196 has not to be added .",
    "this is because we have not divided the whole region into two parts but integrate @xmath155 over the whole time interval .",
    "the result for dispersion without self blurring will be @xmath197 the addition of dispersion of self blurring leads to @xmath198 it practically coincides with the result of simulations .    as the result",
    "the dependence of @xmath19 will be @xmath199",
    "* decay *    now we shall apply the already known formulas for concrete systems .",
    "it is known that two typical types of external conditions are the decay of the metastable state @xcite and the so - called dynamic conditions for condensation @xcite .",
    "the peculiarities of stochastic appearance of droplets were investigated in @xcite , @xcite for decay and in @xcite , @xcite for dynamic conditions . in these publications",
    "the rate of growth for supercritical embryos of liquid phase is supposed to be the regular one .",
    "the results in description of stochastic effects in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite were achieved by application of algebraic structure of the nucleation period .",
    "this structure will be very important below .",
    "* until the moment when the prescribed ( by recipe of the monodisperse approximation ) part of the total ( averaged total ) number of droplets has been appeared the system simply waits .",
    "this is the first subperiod of the nucleation period . * then the second subperiod begins . in this period",
    "the rest droplets appear .",
    "the vapor consumption and , thus , the behavior of supersaturation is fully governed by the growth of droplets appeared in the first subperiod . *",
    "dispersion of the number of droplets appeared in the first subperiod equals to zero , the system is simply waiting for the appearance of the necessary amount of droplets .",
    "* dispersion of the rest droplets , i.e. of the number of droplets appeared in the second subperiod equals to the standard dispersion .",
    "but due to the fact that the number of the rest droplets is less than the total number of droplets the final dispersion will be less than the standard one .",
    "all conclusions except the last one remain valid also under the stochastic model for the droplets growth .",
    "the last conclusion has to be reconsidered .",
    "really , earlier the cut off by the vapor consumption was absolutely regular since the number of droplets in the first subperiod has to be absolutely fixed and , hence , the action of these droplets was absolutely prescribed .",
    "now the situation is changed .",
    "the cut off of the rest part of spectrum can be initiated in different moments of time since the droplets from the first part of spectrum ( let us call them as the the leading droplets ) can grow faster or slower .",
    "* suppose that the droplets grow slower than the averaged velocity .",
    "then the moment of the cut off will be later and more droplets than the standard value appear in the rest part of spectrum . *",
    "suppose that the droplets grow faster than the averaged velocity .",
    "then the moment of the cut off will be earlier and less droplets than the standard value appear in the rest part of spectrum .",
    "certainly , the picture of ueg is nt absolutely correct .",
    "it is clear that the balancing factor appear .",
    "this factor is similar to that which leads to the absence of dispersion in formation of the leading droplets .",
    "suppose that the initially determined leading droplets grow slower than ordinary .",
    "does it mean that only these droplets have to be taken into account in vapor consumption during the nucleation period ?",
    "certainly not .",
    "we have simply to include into the group of leading droplets some new droplets appeared a few moments later than the initial boundary between the leading droplets and the rest droplets .",
    "so , the existence of a balancing force is evident here .",
    "now suppose that the initially determined leading droplets grow faster than ordinary",
    ". then we have to exclude from the group of leading droplets some the last droplets appeared just before the initial boundary between the leading droplets and the rest droplets .",
    "so , the balancing force here also takes place .",
    "it is clear that the picture with unbalanced effects of growth will estimate the stochastic effects of growth from above .",
    "we shall use this property to calculate the stochastic effects in this picture and then to see that they are small enough .        to grasp the stochastic effects from above we use the picture of unbalanced effects of growth and calculate the effects from the stochastic appearance of droplets and from stochastic growth into dispersion .",
    "we suppose that one can add dispersions caused by both stochastic causes .",
    "it is true at least when one of dispersions is much smaller than another .",
    "namely this situation will take place .",
    "fortunately the initial size is well determined in the advanced monodisperse approximation and it is not zero . in the previous initial monodisperse approximation it was zero and the consideration of stochastic effects required to give in @xcite a new version where the initial position of monodisperse spectrum ( the @xmath205 -coordinate ) in renormalized scale is @xmath206 .",
    "namely the new version has to be used .",
    "one can also determine @xmath52 in a following simple manner .",
    "the actual height of monodisperse spectrum is the unperturbed rate of nucleation ( of appearance ) @xmath208 . since @xmath209 we can get the characteristic width of the spectrum @xmath106 .",
    "this value will be initial value for @xmath210 .",
    "it is clear that approximately this way leads to the same value of @xmath52 .",
    "then since the dependence on @xmath52 is like @xmath211 we see that the results of two ways to determine @xmath52 will be approximately equivalent .",
    "the zero value of @xmath212 would lead to divergence , now such a danger is over and one can see that the asymptotic at @xmath90 for characteristic relative deviation in @xmath1 is @xmath213 and goes to zero .",
    "the total characteristic relative deviation will be        we have to note the absence of the shift of the averaged value of the final size from the value calculated on the base of the regular law of growth .",
    "the order of this deviation is less than the characteristic attained value .",
    "if this shift was essential the action on the averaged number of droplets would be significant .        in dynamic conditions all previous arguments are valid .",
    "the initial size @xmath52 has to determined by the following way . since in the approximation of monodisperse consumption @xcite the monodisperse spectrum",
    "is formed already at @xmath217 one can say that it is formed at the ideal conditions ( the real supersaturation coincides with the ideal one ) . then the characteristic width of spectrum will be @xmath218 . then the starting value value @xmath210 will have the order @xmath218 @xmath219 the final value @xmath220 will have the order @xmath221 @xmath222 all other constructions are absolutely analogous .",
    "certainly , the numerical simulation can not give correction terms where the effects of stochastic growth can be noticed because these effects will be corrections for corrections to the main result .",
    "the corrections connected with the discrete growth by steps of absorption of one molecule will be more significant .",
    "one has also to note that at the further periods of evolution ( after the end of nucleation ) the stochastic effects of growth will be more important .",
