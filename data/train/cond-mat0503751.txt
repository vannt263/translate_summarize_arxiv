    "shot noise in mesoscopic conductors,@xcite has attracted great interest , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "while shot noise measurements are an important tool in experimental labs , the measurement of non - gaussian noise presents an experimental challenge.@xcite noise characteristics beyond the size of the typical fluctuation , known as full counting statistics ( fcs),@xcite are interesting because they bring additional information about the transport properties of the measured conductor .",
    "in particular , the extreme value statistics ( evs ) can have qualitatively different behavior than typical fluctuations,@xcite and thus gives rise to new physical effects .",
    "how these rare fluctuations can be measured is one outstanding question that this paper is concerned with , and has only recently received attention.@xcite    the standard measurement method runs the current through a series of cables , filters and amplifiers before the noise is detected . while this works well for the noise power , and can be extended to the third cumulant with great effort,@xcite it is very hard to experimentally measure rare current fluctuations .",
    "a breakthrough in measurement technology came with on - chip detectors , which use superconducting devices , or quantum dots for a variety of functions , such as fast qubit read - out@xcite or high - frequency quantum noise measurement.@xcite    in addition to the many advantages of going on - chip , a further possibility advanced in this paper is the use of two - terminal , rather than four - terminal measurements for low frequency noise .",
    "four - terminal measurements are intrinsically limited by the small coupling constant between the measurement circuit and the conductor , as well as by the fact that the low - frequency noise can evade the measurement device by leakage through the bias line.@xcite in contrast , a two - terminal noise detector is strongly coupled , and detection is fundamentally a non - perturbative process that serves as a preamplifier of the low frequency microscopic noise .    in order to exploit the above advantages , we propose circuits with an instability as detectors of low frequency noise , as well as fcs .",
    "the considered on - chip circuit consists of a mesoscopic conductor with a parallel mesoscopic capacitor , connected in series with the nonlinear element ( see fig .",
    "1).@xcite the nonlinear element has a region of negative differential resistance , which allows bistability .",
    "the mesoscopic conductor loads the instability , so that there are two stable charge points on the capacitor , corresponding to two different currents through the circuit . in this bistable range",
    ", the shot noise occasionally causes the circuit to transit from one stable state to the other , producing a random telegraph signal.@xcite the rate of transition is exponentially sensitive to the size of the fluctuation,@xcite and thus serves as a threshold detector for the rare current fluctuations .",
    "although the threshold rates are not a direct measurement of the fcs , they reorganize the complete information about the noise statistics in an indirect way , `` telegraphing '' the size of a fluctuation . therefore , bistable systems are a promising candidate for low - frequency noise detectors , and can confirm or falsify a given prediction for fcs .",

    "is plotted in fig .  1 versus the charge on the parallel capacitor @xmath1 ( we choose to speak about the charge on the capacitor , rather than the voltage across the right element @xmath2 . ) the nonlinear element on the left has a range of negative differential resistance , which leads to the possibility of three charge / current points , @xmath3 , where the i - q curves intersect , so the average current is conserved in the circuit .",
    "the central intersection at @xmath4 is unstable to small charge perturbations , while the outer two intersections @xmath5 are stable .",

    "this corresponds to large action , or a very small switching rate , which makes the measurement of the fcs experimentally challenging . to overcome this difficulty a general strategy",
    "should be based on the following ingredients :    1 .   a separation of time scales , that allows the measurement of the markovian fcs of the fast microscopic noise sources that drive the classical circuit on a longer time scale .",

    "the charge width is given by the density of states of the cavity , times the peak s voltage width , @xmath129 .",
    "together , these two conditions constrain the size of the cavity , /t_m",
    "> _ c > /q , [ dc ] which gives a rather small parameter range .    finally , to go out of equilibrium , the system must be cooled to mesoscopic temperatures , @xmath130 , much smaller than the mean level spacing of the small quantum dot . however , it would be also interesting to observe evs even in equilibrium . while the noise power in equilibrium is simply a consequence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem",
    ", the evs is nontrivial .",
    "we now compare our idea with other proposals for measuring noise and evs of mesoscopic conductors . in the proposals discussed below",
    ", the measurement device is in a separate circuit weakly coupled to the mesoscopic conductor that acts as an external noise source .",
    "aguado and kouwenhoven proposed a double quantum dot as a detector of high frequency noise.@xcite the quantum noise causes inelastic transitions between the states of quantum dot , and therefore the double dot current is proportional to the noise power at that frequency .",
    "tobiska and nazarov proposed using josephson junctions as a measurement device.@xcite a rare current fluctuation causes the quantum phase to jump over the top of its effective potential , creating a transition from the superconducting phase to the normal conducting phase .",
    "the switching rate gives information about the probability of the rare current fluctuation .",
    "macroscopic quantum tunneling is suppressed by having an array of josephson junctions to make the potential barrier width large .",
    "pekola also proposed using josephson junctions as a measurement device.@xcite in this proposal , the noise first creates a transition from the ground state to the first excited state , where macroscopic quantum tunneling causes escape .",
    "the noise experiment implementing this last proposal , ref .",
    "[ ] , provided additional clarification of the difficulties involved in measuring fcs . similarly to the double - dot detector , @xcite the josephson junction measured noise at the plasma frequency of the junction , while the low frequency noise leaked through the bias line .",
    "this also explained why the expected exponential dependence of the rate on the current threshold was not found .",
    "our proposal is based on essentially different physics : the threshold detector is supposed to work in a regime where detection is a non - perturbative process due to strong coupling to the measured system .",
    "although a realization of this threshold detector is an experimental challenge , there are several advantages of our proposal .",
    "the separation of time scales requirement @xmath7 is necessary to measure low frequency noise : the finite response time allows many electrons to enter and leave the cavity , so the markovian limit is reached .",
    "this limit also implies that quantum effects are not relevant .",
    "detector feedback , usually a liability , is completely accounted for .",
    "in fact , detector feedback is an essential ingredient for our proposal .",
    "we have proposed the use of circuit instabilities as two - terminal detectors of low - frequency noise .",
    "the considered circuit consists of a mesoscopic conductor with parallel capacitor , in series with a nonlinear element .",
    "the nonlinear device contains a region of negative differential resistance , which allows bistability .",
    "there are two regimes of interest , from the point of view of shot noise measurement .",
    "the first is the gaussian regime , where the noise power is much larger than the current threshold . in this limit ,",
    "the noise power is effectively constant , and the higher cumulants may be neglected .",
    "the noise drives a transition between two current values , the telegraph process .",
    "this process produces a step in the i - v curve of universal form , with only one variable parameter , from which the noise power may be extracted .",
    "the second cumulant has a peak at the current step , while the third cumulant has a peak and a dip , the relative weight depending on an asymmetry parameter of the switching rates .",
    "we further considered external circuit effects . in the current biased case , the dominant effect is that the i - v curve has a plateau , not a step , because it is the voltage that switches , not the current .",
    "the measurement of gaussian noise may be carried out with macroscopic conductors containing nonlinearities , such as resonant tunneling wells .",
    "the second regime is the threshold regime , where the noise power is smaller than the current threshold . in this limit ,",
    "the switch comes from the tails of the distribution , and is a direct signature of the extreme value statistics of the mesoscopic conductor .",
    "the most interesting effect occurs for charge distributions that have a cut - off .",
    "this cut - off manifests itself in a divergence of the switching rate , that stabilizes the state .",
    "we considered both pauli stabilization from a quantum point contact , as well as stabilization from a microscopic random telegraph process . while the measurement of full counting statistics requires a mesoscopic instability because of the long time scales involved , the stabilization effect from the random telegraph process should be visible in macroscopic nonlinear elements .",
    "we proposed a quantum double dot operating in the resonant tunneling regime as an implementation of the threshold detector of rare shot noise fluctuations .",
    "constrains on the conductance of the measured conductor , and the capacitance of the central dot were discussed .                                          if the rates are not that small , it is important to first subtract off the noise background in eqs .",
    "( [ c2],[c3 ] ) before applying the self - consistent check .",
    "this is straightforward to do , because the crossover between the stable states in higher order cumulants is also universal .",

    "there is a further possibility that occurs when the standard deviation of the voltage fluctuations exceed the range of the nonlinear voltage step . here",
