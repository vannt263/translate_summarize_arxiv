    "an issue that has not yet been widely explored is the influence of colloidal confinement on polymer conformations and implications for phase behaviour of cp mixtures .",
    "polymers near surfaces and polymer - mediated interactions between surfaces have been examined by a variety of theoretical approaches , including scaling theory  @xcite , integral equation theory  @xcite , classical density - functional ( df ) theory  @xcite , and field - theoretic methods  @xcite .",

    "the constraint of fixed polymer size is thus relaxed by endowing the effective polymer spheres with an internal degree of freedom that can respond to colloidal confinement .",
    "we study the phase behaviour of a model mixture of hs colloids and compressible polymers by means of a geometry - based df theory .",
