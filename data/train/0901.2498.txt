    "pattern formation has gained a lot of interest in both the physical @xcite and the ecological @xcite literature .",
    "patterns may either emerge from the dynamics itself or reflect the structure of the underlying landscape . since the mechanism of pattern formation plays a crucial role , for instance , in ecological systems",
    "when one is concerned about extinctions of species @xcite , it is of fundamental interest to be able to pin down the essential mechanism .",
    "the classical model of two - species systems , such as predator  prey or host  parasitoid systems , is the lotka ",
    "volterra ( lv ) model @xcite .",
    "it assumes fully stirred , or panmictic , species .",
    "however , introducing explicit space typically leads to correlated structures where the assumption breaks down @xcite .",
    "the correlations manifest themselves in a wide variety of forms .",
    "the most common ones are spray - like or flame - like in spatial dimensions @xcite , ripple - like in space ",
    "time @xcite , and spiral - like @xcite .",
    "similar patterning has also been observed in several related models in statistical physics @xcite , in chemical surface catalysis @xcite , in calcium signaling in cells @xcite , and in the infamous complex ginzburg  landau equation ( cgle ) @xcite , for instance .    in ecological and chemical systems ,",
    "the correlations typically weaken the interactions , since species tend to be aggregated within themselves .",
    "they also provide the prey ( host ) a spatial refuge since around the prey ( host ) there are less predators ( parasitoids ) .",
    "this is called the spatial rescue effect @xcite . altogether",
    ", spatial inhomogeneity can stabilize the dynamics and strengthen population coexistence @xcite even via several different mechanisms @xcite .",
    "spatial two - population dynamics can also lead to counter - intuitive effects in which increasing the host ( prey in prey  predator systems ) spreading rate actually leads to smaller host population sizes @xcite .",
    "understanding spatiotemporal dynamics in highly fragmented landscapes @xcite is of even greater difficulty .",
    "there are also myriads of empirical observations of the patterning in ecological systems . among the most intriguing examples are field voles in northern britain with evidence of traveling waves @xcite , mussel beds in the wadden sea in the netherlands with regular spatial patterns @xcite together with voles @xcite and lemmings @xcite in northern europe .",
    "recently , similar studies have also been performed in experimental laboratory conditions @xcite .    in this contribution , we study a numerical model of spatially extended two - population , or three - state , dynamics .",
    "we formulate the model in terms of hosts and parasitoids but in the scope of this work , these are interchangeable with prey and predator , respectively .",
    "it is defined on a regular square lattice , and the spreading of the species occurs in a distance - dependent way according to the corresponding incidence functions ( see below ) .",
    "there are two regimes of coexistence : the species can be either distributed homogeneously in space , or build up spatial correlations or patterns ( see fig .  [",

    "the first one concentrates on the patterns , which we first coarse - grain into areas dominated by one of the species or empty space .",
    "they give rise to vortices as the corner points of three different areas , and domain walls as the boundary lines between them .",
    "we introduce several quantities describing the geometry and dynamics of these objects .",
    "they include the instantaneous velocities of the vortices , their number and lifetime , the average length of the domain walls and the shape of the dominance areas close to the vortices .",
    "all these quantities support the division of the parameter space into two kinds of coexistence .",
    "the second point of view is that of the global dynamics of the system . here",
    ", we extend on our previous results @xcite in which we have shown that for large enough systems there are no non - linearities and in the spatially correlated coexistence regime , the global dynamics is governed by noise - sustained oscillations not conforming to the traditional limit cycles .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : example_timeser ] for examples of the corresponding time series .",
    "we show that the linearization coefficients differ from what one gets from the complete mixing , or mean - field , assumption , that this is caused by the dependence of the effective spreading parameters on the instantaneous global population densities , and that this dependence is vastly different in the two different coexistence regimes .",
    "we also link the dynamics together with the patterns by showing that the former one can be understood as an infinite stream of aperiodically occurring spontaneous synchronizations .",
    "both the tools for the patterns classification and the analysis of the dynamics are not restricted to the particular case studied here .",
    "foremost , they are not restricted to two species ( or three states ) or two spatial dimensions .",
    "in addition , their domain of applicability does not lie in ecology only ; the voter models of statistical physics @xcite and certain surface catalysis reactions @xcite lead to similar patterning , and sometimes similar dynamics , as well , and the machinery discussed here provides means to characterize and classify the patterns also in these areas .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the model is defined in detail together with the coarse - graining procedure , vortices , domain walls and quantities derived from them .",
    "the section also discusses the program to correct the mf equations . in secs .",
    "iii and iv the results regarding patterns and dynamics , respectively , are presented and discussed .",
    "v contains an example application of the analysis , and sec .",
    "vi discusses the results both from the physical and the ecological point of view and makes connections to earlier and contemporary literature .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vii wraps up the paper and concludes .",
    "the model describes annual host  parasitoid dynamics on a regular two - dimensional square lattice @xmath8 .",
    "it is inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite but has a wider interaction range as typical in metapopulation dynamics @xcite . at a given time , a lattice site can be empty ( state @xmath5 ) , populated by a host either without ( @xmath6 ) or with ( @xmath7 ) parasitoids .",
    "the dynamics allows for a cycle of transitions , @xmath9 .",
    "this is a simplification that neglects the decay of the hosts on their own , and in turn emphasizes the role of the parasitoids . in particular",
    ", spontaneous deaths of non - parasitized hosts are assumed to be rare enough to be considered nonexistent . even though this means that hosts live forever if parasitoids are absent , the restriction is not serious . in coexistence",
    "it reduces to assuming faster typical extinction times for the parasitoids than for the hosts .",
    "an equivalent description of the model is as a variant of the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model @xcite with longer spreading lengths and rebirth . here",
    ", the infected state corresponds to hosts , the recovered one to parasitoids , and the rebirth to the spontaneous death of the parasitoids .",
    "the transition probabilities between the states are functions of the _ connectivities _ which in turn depend on the local populations and are thus directly related to the number of immigrants arriving at a lattice site . for a given configuration , the connectivity of species @xmath6 or @xmath7 on lattice site @xmath10 at time @xmath11 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the characteristic function , i.e.  @xmath14 if the state of @xmath15 at time @xmath11 is @xmath6 or @xmath7 , respectively , and @xmath16 else .",
    "the kernel has an exponential decay with a characteristic scale @xmath17 @xmath18 and is normalized such that its integral over the whole plane equals one . in time",
    "step @xmath19 , the transition @xmath20 takes place with probability @xmath21 and transition @xmath22 with probability @xmath23 .",
    "the parasitoids die out ( the transition @xmath24 ) with probability @xmath25 irrespective of the surroundings .",
    "parallel updates are used .",
    "there is an absorbing state with the lattice completely filled with hosts without any parasitoids , together with long - lived reactive coexistence states .",
    "there are numerous assumptions in the model from the ecological point of view .",
    "the first and foremost are the long - range interactions . in realistic cases , they are particularly important for the stability of the system since they contribute to immigration and survival also in remote habitat patches . in a regular lattice ,",
    "their role is not as emphasized .",
    "the assumption , however , is fairly weak , since the dispersal takes place according to an exponentially decaying kernel , i.e.  there is a typical short interaction length .",
    "furthermore , the connectivity ( [ eq : connectivity ] ) is defined such that parasitized hosts do not contribute to the host connectivity .",
    "naturally , this is not completely true in empirical systems , since unparasitized hosts can be found also in parasitized habitat patches and these are fully capable of contributing to the spreading of the hosts .",
    "all these assumptions are minor ones and they do not hinder one from being able to tackle the relevant and interesting properties of the model system .    in the mf approximation , the behavior of the system can be calculated as follows .",
    "the rate equations for the population densities are @xmath26 where the coupling constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 are just the total transition rates obtained under constant densities",
    ". there are three fixed points : the coexistence @xmath29 if @xmath30 , the extinction of parasitoids @xmath31 otherwise , and the extinction of both species @xmath32 which is achieved if the hosts die out before the parasitoids do . the coexistence fixed point can be either stable or unstable depending on the parameters .",
    "the unstable case corresponds to a limit cycle .",
    "below , we compare these elementary observations to the behavior of the spatially extended system . since the mf approximation is merely a rough one , there is no particular reason to expect one - to - one correspondence .      to characterize the patterns ,",
    "consider a spatially smoothed continuous field of population densities @xcite @xmath33 where the smoothing kernel @xmath34 is a two - dimensional gaussian such that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . here",
    "the variance @xmath38 is called the smoothing width , and the summation runs over all lattice sites . at each site @xmath15 , the smoothed densities @xmath39 oscillate around the temporally and spatially averaged densities @xmath40 and @xmath41 we use these to divide the two - dimensional phase space spanned by the densities into three sectors , defined in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : domains ] .",
    "they are then used to divide the system into _ prevalence domains _ so that site @xmath15 at time @xmath11 is defined to belong to a domain according to the region of the phase space containing the smoothed densities at location @xmath15 , i.e.  @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : smoothed_densities ] ) .",
    "the regions coarse - grain on a scale somewhat larger than the typical interaction lengths .",
    "they are not sensitive to changes in the smoothing width @xmath38 given that it is larger than the interaction lengths and smaller than the system size @xmath43 .",
    "the domains readily give rise to more sophisticated quantities .",
    "to start , define the vortices as the corner points of the three different types of domains .",
    "these are associated with a positive or negative unit `` charge '' since one can encounter the three domains in two different orders by traversing a circle around it in a given direction ( say , counter - clockwise ) .",
    "similar structures with three kinds of domains rotating around their corner points without any coarse - graining have been identified earlier in statistical physics in the context of the three - state voter model @xcite , the extended three - state voter model and the three - state potts model @xcite , and combinations thereof @xcite .",
    "also a four - state model with game - theoretical inspirations @xcite shows similar vortices . in three dimensions ,",
    "the vortices generalize to strings @xcite .",
    "further , the domain walls are defined as the boundary lines between two domains of different types .",
    "there are three kinds of walls , according to the possible three pairs of domain types they separate , and exactly one wall of any given type emanates from a given vortex .",
    "the vortices and domain walls provide simple means to describe the population patterns , as we demonstrate below .",
    "to derive quantities that follow the evolution of the vortices and domain walls in time , it is necessary to be able to reliably track their motion . to this end , we have implemented the following procedure .",
    "let the @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the sets of vortices with negative and positive sign , respectively , at time @xmath11 .",
    "denote by @xmath46 and @xmath47 the same after one discrete time step , i.e.  at time @xmath48 .",
    "an interpretation for the movements of the vortices , including creation and annihilation or pairs , is a simple pairing of the sets @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "if an element @xmath51 of this pairing consists of vortices in @xmath44 and @xmath46 ( @xmath45 and @xmath47 ) a negatively ( positively ) charged vortex is interpreted to have moved but not annihilated .",
    "if the element consists of vortices in @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the two vortices are considered to have annihilated with each other , and , finally , if the element is a pair of vortices from @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the vortices are considered to be newly created vortices at time step @xmath48 that did not exist at time @xmath11 .    there is an enormous number of such pairings , and physically motivated means of selecting one are needed . to this end , define a fully connected weighted bipartite graph @xmath52 , where the vortex sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the vertices , the edge set their cartesian product @xmath55 , and the weight function @xmath38 assigns each edge ( @xmath56 ) a weight equal to the euclidean distance between vortices @xmath10 and @xmath57 .",
    "we use the so - called hungarian method from graph theory to obtain the pairing of the sets @xmath53 and @xmath54 that has the minimum total weight .",
    "this pairing is then used to interpret the motion , annihilation , and creation of the vortices as described above . the hungarian method itself",
    "is a well - known exact optimization algorithm for the bipartite pairing problem based on graph flows .",
    "it is fairly complex but it runs in cubic time with respect to the number of elements in the sets to be paired .",
    "detailed explanations of it can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "building on the tracking procedure for the vortices , it is simple to outline a similar procedure for the domain walls .",
    "we consider a given wall observed at time @xmath11 to be the same wall as another one at time @xmath48 if and only if it is of the same type ( separates the same two domain types ) and if both its endpoint vortices are identified as the same according to the method above .",
    "a necessary condition for this is that the vortices have not been annihilated .    after implementing these identification procedures , the vortices and walls",
    "can be used to derive a practically unlimited number of quantities that , in a way or another , describe the dynamics or the statics of the patterns . here",
    ", we have used several , selecting the ones considered most suitable .",
    "these include the jump length of the vortices , i.e.  distance traveled by a vortex in unit time , the number and lifetime of vortices , the geometry of the domains in the immediate vicinity of the vortices described by the widths of the sectors the domains form around them , and the lengths of the domain walls themselves .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] for a schematic illustration of some of these quantities .    upon applying these metrics ,",
    "attention must be paid to the fact that random fluctuations around the average densities also create vortices and domain walls .",
    "this is an unfortunate side effect of the definitions that must not be neglected but has to be taken into account .",
    "this is especially important in the case of the domain wall lengths , in which the fluctuations give rise to a nonzero background level , and it is the deviations of the wall length statistics from this background  not from zero  that signals the onset of patterns . here , we take the background into account by creating random configurations of the system by assigning each lattice site a state of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 randomly using the spatiotemporally averaged densities @xmath58 and @xmath59 from a simulation as the occurrence probabilities of the respective states",
    ". the background vortex and wall length levels are then obtained by computing the same metrics for these random configurations .      the mf equations ( [ eq : naivemf ] ) discussed in the introduction",
    "assume full mixing both within a single species and between two species . in spatially extended systems , such as the one studied here , the assumptions fail almost invariably .",
    "there are several known ways to incorporate spatial effects .",
    "these include , for example , pair approximations @xcite , rescaling the coordination number of the lattice @xcite , and others @xcite . here , our approach is to use input from numerical simulations to introduce corrections of different order to the mf equations .",
    "these corrections are such that there is no need to specify a functional form for the interactions before the analysis .",
    "the zeroth - order correction is to consider the change in the effective values of the spreading rate parameters introduced by the spatial effects .",
    "this is done by running the simulations for different values of the parameters , obtaining the average population densities as a function of them , and subsequently using the inverse of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nontrivialfp ] ) to arrive at those effective values of the mf parameters that lead to the densities observed in the simulations .",
    "however , common experience suggests that this kind of rescaling of the parameters is an utterly implausible explanation for the spatial effects . instead",
    ", higher order schemes have to be used .",
    "the first - order correction builds on the zeroth - order one .",
    "now , in addition , the effective parameters are considered functions of the instantaneous population densities @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 small , they equal the spreading probabilities , and thus dynamics can be written as @xcite @xmath63 \\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath64 where the influence of the connectivities on the prevalence dynamics is expressed by the correlation functions @xmath65 an approximation of these equations can be written as ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : naivemf ] ) ) @xmath66 this is an approximation of the usual mf form with the interaction parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 generalized to be arbitrary functions of the instantaneous densities .",
    "the full form of them seems to be in general not obtainable analytically . in general",
    ", they can be nonlinear , and in particular they do not have to conform to the standard lv model nor to any ad - hoc approximations discussed in the literature , for example turning the coordination number of the lattice into two effective coordination numbers that serve as phenomenological parameters separately for the hosts and the parasitoids @xcite .",
    "to arrive at the first - order correction , perform a series expansion of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lv ] ) around the fixed point @xmath69 and introduce auxiliary variables @xmath70 and @xmath71 such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "doing this , we arrive to linear order at @xmath74 with the matrix elements @xmath75 in which @xmath28 , @xmath27 , their derivatives , and the population densities are evaluated at the fixed point @xmath69 .    if the four derivatives are set to zero in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix_elements ] ) , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) and ( [ eq : matrix_elements ] ) fall back to the mean - field approximation , and the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) is directly the linearization matrix usable for the standard stability analysis . on the other hand , if the derivatives are nonzero , the mean - field analysis is not valid anymore .",
    "this situation can be interpreted as instantaneous densities affecting the spreading rates .",
    "as we have demonstrated earlier @xcite and will elaborate on below , the linear form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) and ( [ eq : matrix_elements ] ) can be readily fitted to temporal data from simulations of the spatially extended model , and numerical values for the matrix elements can be easily obtained .",
    "this allows one to solve for the four derivatives , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and subsequently arrive at the first order correction to the mf equations .",
    "note that this computation reveals the domain of applicability of the mean - field treatment by either yielding vanishing derivatives ( applicable ) or non - vanishing ones ( not applicable ) . in principle",
    ", the procedure could be continued _",
    "ad infinitum _ to higher derivatives leading to higher - order corrections .",
    "these calculations are omitted here , however , since the linear treatment turns out to be enough to demonstrate and discuss the effect of the corrections .",
    "note that the program outlined here is by no means restricted to the present model , but it can be applied to virtually any other one with a similar structure . in particular , it is not restricted to two - species ( or three - state ) models , two spatial dimensions and not even to discrete time , since continuous - time results can always be retrospectively discretized by sampling snapshots , nor discrete space .",
    "promising candidates for such an application include those in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "the vortices and the domain walls can be located and followed through time as described in section [ sec : characterizing_patterns ] . in general , considering quantities derived from these leads to an observation of two distinct kinds of coexistence regimes .",
    "there is one with formation of chaotic moving fronts , patterns , and another one without them .",
    "all computations discussed in detail below support the division .",
    "first , we consider the jump length of the vortices , i.e.  the distance a given vortex moves in unit time .",
    "a histogram of these is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex_jump_length ] for the values of the parasitoid spreading rate parameter @xmath76 corresponding to the patterned and the non - patterned cases .",
    "both distributions are exponential , but the patterned case has a clearly smaller average jump length than the non - patterned one .",
    "similarly , we plot the lifetime distributions of the vortices in the same two cases in fig .  [",
    "fig : vortex_lifetime ] .",
    "now , the difference between them is even bigger ; in the patterned case the vortices live typically ten times as long as in the non - patterned case .",
    "therefore , with patterns the vortices are more stable than without them both with respect to movements and annihilation . were the typical vortex jump lengths considered in units of the typical pattern size ( for example , the average domain wall length discussed below ) , the difference between the two cases would be even more pronounced .    in a more detailed inspection , the vortex lifetime distribution in the patterned case ( @xmath4 ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : vortex_lifetime ] is composed of two parts ; for short lifetimes the distribution follows that of the non - patterned case , and for long lifetimes , there is a broad tail .",
    "a direct consideration of the definition of a vortex reveals the cause .",
    "namely , vortices can , roughly speaking , originate in two different ways .",
    "they can be either signs of a `` real '' inhomogeneous structure such as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] , or merely random fluctuations around the average population densities .",
    "the former leads to the wide tail , whereas the latter shows up as the short - lifetime part of the distribution .",
    "next , we turn to the geometry of the dominance regions in the vicinity of the vortices .",
    "we compute the angles between the tangent lines of the three walls ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) and plot the distributions in the patterned case in fig .",
    "[ fig : mutual ] .",
    "the parasite - dominated sectors appear to be rather narrow ( typically 60 degrees ) in comparison to the host- and empty - dominated ones , whose typical spread equals approximately 160 degrees .",
    "this is somewhat balanced by the larger variance of the width of the parasite - dominated sectors . in any case , these observations conform to those one can make by studying the appearance of fig .",
    "[ fig : domains ] in the vicinity of the vortices by bare eye .",
    "the ratio of the measured domain wall length and its counterpart in random configurations is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ll ] as a function of the two spreading rate parameters , @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter space is clearly divided into two regions with a continuous crossover in between by this quantity . in one of these parts ,",
    "the ratio equals approximately one ( corresponding to homogeneous population densities ) , whereas in the other , the ratio clearly differs from one ( corresponding to pattern formation ) . in other words , in cases where the system does not exhibit patterns visible to human eye ,",
    "the domain wall length statistics also coincides with that in a spatially homogeneous case , whereas with patterns there is a significant difference .",
    "note , however , that the numerical value of the ratio bears no meaning by itself , since it can be tuned to almost any value by altering the smoothing kernel ( in particular the smoothing width @xmath38 ) in the coarse - graining procedure .",
    "nevertheless , for any usable value of @xmath38 , the ratio clearly deviates from one and therefore is a usable metric of the patterning .",
    "the transition between the cases is continuous everywhere on the transition line .",
    "we have also considered similar statistics for the average vortex jump length and the average vortex lifetimes , recovering a continuous crossover in each case .    given all these results on the vortices , the domain walls , and their dynamics",
    ", there remains the question of how much of them can be explained by considering the vortices as identical random walkers with random signs in a plane . to study this point in detail",
    ", we have performed numerical experiments consisting of a set of simulated random walks for a given value of the simulation parameters as follows . for each walk , draw its duration @xmath78 randomly using the measured vortex lifetime distribution .",
    "let each walk start at the origin and perform @xmath78 random steps .",
    "for each step , draw the jump length from the corresponding measured jump length distribution and choose the direction in two dimensions randomly from a uniform distribution .",
    "record the average total length of the walks for each case of interest , i.e.  for different simulation parameters ( and consequently different measured distributions ) .    in the non - patterned and patterned cases ,",
    "we get average total walk lengths of 20 and 9 lattice units , respectively , in the random walk experiment . in the non - patterned case",
    ", this roughly corresponds to half of the average domain wall length which , in turn , approximately equals the average inter - domain distance .",
    "therefore , the picture of vortices as merely uncorrelated random walkers can not be ignored . on the other hand , there is more than an order of magnitude of difference between the average domain wall and random walk lengths .",
    "this rules out any explanation of the dynamics of the system that is based on the random walk picture only .",
    "finally , we take a look at the behavior of the number of vortices as a function of time .",
    "a relevant benchmark for comparison is the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) which has been studied extensively ( for a good review , see @xcite ) .",
    "both in the usual deterministic version of the equation @xcite , and in a version with added noise @xcite , the number of pairs of vortices @xmath79 has been observed to be a markov process with @xmath79-dependent creation and annihilation rates . an essential feature of such processes is the lack of memory of any kind .",
    "we have partially repeated the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite in the present case .",
    "average creation and annihilation rates as a function of @xmath79 can be measured once a sufficient number of realizations of the process have been simulated .",
    "doing this , we arrive at a description similar to eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the creation rate is a constant and the annihilation @xmath80 rate assumes the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants . in this respect",
    "the number of vortices behaves here in the same way as in the cgle .",
    "however , a detailed look reveals again an important difference . in the present case , the number of vortices as a function of time contains an oscillatory component clearly visible both in the time series itself and its fourier power spectrum .",
    "this can not be explained by a one - dimensional memoryless dynamical system , and therefore the vortex number statistics lies outside the realm of applicability of the analysis of refs .  @xcite .    instead , to recreate the vortex number process",
    ", short - term memory has to be incorporated in a way or another .",
    "one way to do this is to consider a two - dimensional process where the role of the second variable is played by the first discrete time derivative of the vortex number @xmath84 .",
    "this leads to a description similar to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) and ( [ eq : matrix_elements ] ) for the vortex number and its derivative . on the other hand ,",
    "the same process can be formulated in terms of the second time derivative or a temporal delay . in any case ,",
    "one - dimensional processes such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : markovannihilationrate ] ) do not suffice .",
    "to gain insight on the dynamics of the system , and to produce the effective low - order corrections to the mf equations , we have used poincar maps @xcite reconstructed from simulations . here , the dynamical ( scalar )",
    "variables of the system at time @xmath48 are considered to be functions of the same at time @xmath11 .",
    "this mapping is then numerically computed from measurements of the dynamical variables from the simulations of the model . in particular , in the case of two dynamical variables , a graphical representation of the poincar maps boils down to two three - dimensional scatter plots . we draw them for two different system sizes in the patterned case and for comparison in the non - patterned one in fig .",
    "[ fig : poincare ] .",
    "immediate conclusions can be made .",
    "there is indeed a clear functional dependence of the densities on their previously assumed values . in other words ,",
    "the dynamics can be described by using the densities themselves only ; as a dynamical system the present one is two - dimensional .",

    "this can be interpreted as direct evidence that the pattern formation and the deviations of the dynamics from the mf description are closely intertwined .",
    "also the behavior of the time scale ratio and the excess line length is qualitatively similar for @xmath109 since both are constants in this regime .",
    "this is comparable to the coupled discrete oscillators of wood and co - workers @xcite , where a related system has a second - order synchronization transition in the mf theory and in higher dimensions but not in two .",

    "[ fig : timeser ] together with the host and parasitoid densities in the same simulation run .",
    "the amplitude of the density oscillations correlates strongly with @xmath115 .",
    "this is to be interpreted such that the system spontaneously synchronizes over at least intermediate length scales at random intervals . as a feature of secondary importance",
    ", the synchronization order parameter @xmath115 oscillates with a time of a period half of that of the population densities , which is also seen in the fourier power spectrum of @xmath115 ( not shown ) .",

    "in addition to the extinction transition of the parasitoids , the coexistence phase can be split into three .",
    "there are the non - patterned and the patterned regions , and since the crossover between them is not sharp a `` gray area '' between them .",
    "we have built the phase diagram in the @xmath117-plane by defining the boundary between the non - patterned case and the gray area to be the line at which the timescale ratio @xmath105 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : timescale_ratio ] ) equals 1.0 , and that of the gray area and the patterned phase where the ratio equals 4.0 . albeit arbitrary , these definitions seem fit since upon looking at the population densities as a function of time and figures such as fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] , the patterns and the oscillations are clearly not there if the ratio is below one , and , on the other hand , if it exceeds 4 , both are clearly observed .",

    "[ fig : phases ] for two choices of the spreading widths @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "it is seen that for any value of @xmath77 the four phases ( parasitoid extinction , homogeneous coexistence , the gray area , and patterned coexistence ) follow each other in this order if the parasite spreading rate parameter @xmath76 is increased .",
    "this feature does not depend on the particular values of the spreading widths , or even their mutual order .",
    "the phase structure bears some resemblance to related earlier models @xcite in that oscillatory and non - oscillatory regions and a boundary between them is recovered .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] for a detailed discussion and comparison .",
    "[ fig : phases]c also shows the vortex density , i.e.  number of vortices per lattice site , as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "one sees that the number of vortices decreases rapidly while going from the nonoscillatory region via the gray area to the oscillatory regime .    finally , we note that even if the system does not in general synchronize macroscopically , such synchronization can be artificially achieved by making the system small with respect to the spreading widths",
    ". this can originate in either making the system really small , or keeping the size fixed and increasing the spreading widths . in these cases ,",
    "the mf theory probably works better than in what has been studied here .",
    "this , however , lies outside the scope of interest since extremely small system sizes or very large spreading lengths are needed .",
    "to give a concrete example of how to apply the methods introduced here , we illustrate the role of coherent dynamics in biological systems by resorting to a well - known metapopulation system , investigated at length by the metapopulation research group at university of helsinki , finland @xcite .",

    "here we use the known patch geography as the `` lattice '' .",
    "the two populations follow a variant of the model used above , with the differences that the contribution of each patch to the connectivities is multiplied by its area , and that in addition to the connectivity - driven spreading a small amount of uniformly random reproduction is used .",
    "these differences are biologically motivated .",
    "intuitively , the immigration pressure from a given patch increases with the local population , which itself is positively coupled to the amount of locally available suitable habitat , the patch size .",

    "this does not restrict the validity of the analysis for two reasons .",
    "first , the equations ( [ eq : lin ] ) are an observation made _ from _ the simulations , and by plotting the poincar maps as in fig .  [",
    "fig : poincare ] , one sees that the equations hold both for open and periodic boundaries .",

    "( [ eq : generalmf ] ) by straightforward differentiation , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lv ] ) , in turn , are a rough approximation equally valid in either case .    fig .",
    "[ fig : alandexample ] shows a snapshot of the system , and the inset contains the respective time series ; see the caption for the parameters .",
    "the question is now , do we find evidence of oscillations and/or patterns here ?",
    "a similar analysis of the dynamics , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) is readily carried out , revealing the eigenvalues @xmath121 for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : alandexample ] .",
    "these imply , in accordance with the appearance of the time series , that the system contains patterns and exhibits oscillations coming from the combination of an unstable fixed point with oscillatory transients and demographic stochasticity .",
    "the patterning is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : alandexample ] .",
    "it can be analyzed using the smoothed densities by considering the sum in the expression for them , eq .",
    "( [ eq : smoothed_densities ] ) , as a summation over the patches , and using the position - dependent smoothed densities assuming average population densities at each patch as the triple point in the phase space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : domains]a ) .",
    "the rest of the analysis can then be carried out as explained in section [ sec : characterizing_patterns ] .",
    "doing this , one finds a domain structure analogous to that on the regular lattice with the average domain wall length @xmath122 .",
    "these observations are of interest for a couple of reasons .",
    "first , the land landscape is rather heterogeneous , and at a closer inspection @xcite appears to consist of a variety of densely connected subsystems , which are weakly coupled to each other . due to the differences in the landscape with respect to a regular lattice",
    ", it is not clear , a priori , that the whole system has similar pattern - included noise - sustained oscillations as the version defined on a regular lattice . instead , the expectation for a single densely connected subsystem is to be closer to the mean - field limit @xcite obeyed by a fully connected ( essentially non - spatial ) system , and since the number of such dense subsystems is relatively small , the expectation is the same for the full system .",
    "however , noise - sustained oscillations are observed , and the land system works as an example of the applicability of the analysis presented here to more realistic cases , than regular lattices .",
    "this is emphasized by the fact that also the dynamics of the model contains differences with respect to the lattice one , in addition to the spatial structure . in any case , the eigenvalues of the effective iterative map ( eq .  ( [ eq : lin ] ) ) provides information about the stability properties and the level of patterning in the system .",
    "the change between the patterned and non - patterned cases is rather abrupt in terms of several quantities .",
    "this leads naturally to the question whether the phenomenon is actually a phase transition .",
    "we argue that this is not the case due to several reasons .",
    "first , since phase transitions are defined only for infinite systems , the transition in plots such as fig .  [ fig : ll ] should become sharper as the system size increases .",
    "however the behavior remains essentially the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ll ] for a wide range of system sizes , except for the fact that for the smallest systems , the highest value the average domain wall length assumes becomes smaller due to finite - size effects . in any case , no sharpening of the transition is observed , and in this respect the correct description of the behavior is as a continuous crossover .",
    "second , similar models have been studied with the transition aspect in mind .",
    "the most relevant one for the present discussion is that by wood and coworkers @xcite , which deals with a symmetric three - state model of discrete coupled oscillators .",
    "it has been found that the system does not have a phase transition in two dimensions but does in three and higher dimensions .",
    "however , in two dimensions , there is a continuous change in the order parameter around the region of the parameter space where the transition would take place in higher dimensions .",
    "this is similar to what has been observed here for the average domain wall lengths , giving further credibility for the interpretation of the change from non - oscillatory to oscillatory behavior as a continuous cross - over .",
    "the eigenvalue structure in the non - patterned case also speaks in favor of the absence of a sharp transition .",
    "we get a complex conjugate eigenvalue pair for the matrix @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) even in the non - patterned case .",
    "the difference lies in the relative magnitudes of the oscillation and decay time scales .",
    "so , even if the ratio of the timescales were used instead of the average domain wall length , there would be no sharp transition ( cf .",
    "[ fig : timescales ] ) .",
    "this can be viewed as a consequence of the corrected mf approach yielding a stable fixed point both in the patterned and the non - patterned regimes . as a conclusion ,",
    "the difference between the two is strictly speaking only quantitative , or  put in other words  in the non - patterned case",
    "the spatial correlations are much more suppressed than in the patterned one .",
    "however , on the other hand , the quantitative difference between the cases is rather huge : there are practically no patterns in the non - oscillatory systems as can be seen by looking at the system itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ) , the average domain wall length ( fig .  [ fig : ll ] ) , and the random walk experiments outlined in section [ sec : effmf ] , for example .",
    "therefore , discussing these two regimes as different appears justified .",
    "in addition to the discrete - space discrete - time setting studied here , the methods of analysis and characterization of patterns and dynamics are equally applicable to systems with continuous time or space , for example that in ref .",
    "@xcite . applying the methodology to such systems might reveal differences between them and their discrete - space counterparts .",
    "studies of these would be interesting already as such .",
    "one possible cause of the differences is that the discretization of space into lattice cells often comes with implicit locally density - dependent establishment , i.e.  the local population density is restricted such that only one individual can be present at one site at a time .",
    "continuous - space approaches typically do not have such restrictions unless explicitly included .",
    "a very similar system restricted to nearest - neighbour spreading has been recently studied @xcite both analytically using the pair approximation and numerically .",
    "the authors of these articles have found that the co - existence phase is divided into two regions .",
    "these are oscillatory and non - oscillatory coexistence .",
    "the similarity to the present case is striking .",
    "it has been concluded in @xcite from the pair approximation that the oscillations are a limit cycle , and indirectly that , since there are oscillations also in the spatially extended counterpart , they have to be limit cycles as well . comparing to the present results reveals that such conclusions can not be made without further evidence ; the possibility of noise - sustained oscillations remains , and for small systems even that of two kinds of oscillatory regimes . while further studies would be needed to resolve this issue , note that in some cases the amplitude fluctuates in a way that appears similar to the fluctuations in the present case .",
    "one example is given by fig .",
    "9a of ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are established results on two - dimensional three - state dynamic lattice models with limit cycle oscillations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , processes on excitable media have been recently characterized in terms of prey  predator systems @xcite , and the machinery introduced here could provide tools for studying those as well .",
    "other comparable approaches taken recently include refs .",
    "@xcite . in these works , a simplified model of two connected patches is studied , and the oscillations are made dependent either on the phase or the amplitude in the phase space . both lead to stabilized oscillations . however , eq .  ( [ eq : lin ] )",
    "explicitly forbids such dependencies in the present case , and therefore the mechanisms suggested in @xcite can not be the root cause of the stability in the spatially extended case studied here .    another interesting approach is to map related population models @xcite to the complex ginzburg - landau equation @xcite .",
    "the mappings rely on the existence of an unstable fixed point @xcite , and the oscillations are classical limit cycles .",
    "therefore , these studies and the present one can be described as complementary approaches to each other .",
    "while the present model is without doubt castable as a partial differential equation at least in an approximative manner , it is an open question of what the outcome from such equations would be .",
    "since the fully - mixed approximation can have both a stable and an unstable fixed point , a mapping to the cgle along the lines of @xcite would not work , and further complications are also caused by the highly asymmetric reaction rates @xcite . due to these reasons , it is not immediately clear that the picture of noise - sustained oscillations linked to patterns via spontaneous synchronizations would be captured by such a treatment . in any case",
    ", this kind of analysis offers an intriguing issue for future studies .",
    "a model of two - species dynamics defined and treated in the language of hosts and parasitoids but equally applicable to prey  predator systems as well has been studied .",
    "in addition to extinct states , the system shows two kinds of coexistence , depending on the parameters .",
    "these are a patterned state with oscillating population densities and a non - patterned state with populations homogeneously distributed in space , and densities that fluctuate around their respective averages .",
    "this contribution contains two closely tied lines of work .",
    "one characterizes the patterns via coarse - graining the habitat space to domains in which a given species or empty space is dominant .",
    "the other concentrates on the dynamics of the system .",
    "the coarse - grained domains allow for a definition of domain walls as the lines separating the domains , and vortices as their corner points . from these ,",
    "we compute several quantities , such as the instantaneous vortex velocities , their lifetime , the lengths of the domain walls , and ones describing the geometry of the domains in the vicinity of the vortices .",
    "invariably , these quantities reveal the division of the parameter space into two kinds of coexistence .",
    "we have argued that these two regions are separated by a continuous cross - over rather than a conventional phase transition .",
    "we have also reasoned why the vortex number process is not comparable to that in the cgle @xcite .",
    "the main argument is based on the fact that the process is not memoryless .",
    "the dynamics has been studied using poincar maps @xcite .",
    "we have found out that as a stochastic dynamical system , the present one is two - dimensional . in other words , the dynamics is adequately described in terms of the two population densities and the unit - time advancing mapping , the poincar map , of the two .",
    "no further dynamical variables nor history - dependence are needed .",
    "in addition , for large systems the poincar maps are linear leading to an easy characterization of the behavior using eigenvalue analysis . in both the patterned and the non - patterned case",
    ", this reveals a stable fixed point with oscillatory transients .",
    "however , between the cases there is a huge difference in the level of separation between the associated oscillation and decay time scales .",
    "this also leads to a direct connection between the patterning and the dynamics , since the ratio of the two timescales has been shown to be closely related to the average domain wall lengths .",
    "the amplitude fluctuations have also been given a spatial interpretation as an irregular sequence of spontaneous synchronization and desynchronization events of coupled oscillators @xcite whose role in this setting is played by mesoscopic subsystems .",
    "we have also compared the average densities in the system to those predicted by a mean - field theory .",
    "we have introduced corrections to the mf equations on two levels based on series expansions and simulated data . in both zeroth- and first - order settings ,",
    "the cross - over between the patterned and the non - patterned cases is visible and crucial .",
    "the results have been compared to earlier literature .",
    "there are numerous results on related systems where oscillations have been recovered . in some of these , the oscillations might in fact be noise - sustained in character .",
    "interesting candidates to study this possibility include @xcite . in all of these , the machinery for pattern characterization introduced here could be applied to produce further insight .",
    "we have applied the analysis briefly to the empirical metapopulation landscape of a butterfly and its parasitoids wasp @xcite .",
    "future prospects include studying these issues further - we have merely highlighted the applicability of the results presented here .",
    "studying such systems could , for instance , let one approach the question of how to tell the difference between patterns caused by inhomogeneities in the landscape and those that are spontaneously formed even on homogeneous substrates .",
