    "photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) has been discussed in literature for almost half a century by now @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon arises when a relatively high frequency field is applied across a tunnel junction whose dc current - voltage characteristics are highly non - linear .",
    "the radiation field is , however , slow enough to guarantee adiabatic evolution of the energy levels of the electrons .",
    "a typical system to observe pat is a sis tunnel junction , with superconducting ( s ) leads and a tunnel barrier ( i ) in between . even though the system as such is a josephson junction for cooper pairs , pat deals with the influence of the radiation on quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "our system of interest here is a nis tunnel junction , where one of the conductors is a normal metal ( n ) .",
    "such junctions exhibit highly nonlinear current - voltage characteristics at low temperatures , and normally the current is due to quasiparticles only .",
    "nis - junctions are known to have peculiar heat transport properties under the application of a dc bias voltage @xcite , or ( `` quasi - static '' ) ac radiation of relatively low frequency in form of either periodic or stochastic drive @xcite .",
    "specifically , it is possible to find operation regimes where the normal metal is refrigerated and the superconductor is overheated , and in some special situations the opposite can occur as well .",
    "the question remains whether and under what conditions the relatively high frequency radiation responsible for pat would either enhance or suppress the thermal transport in the nis - system . in this paper",
    "we show that the influence of pat , as compared to static and quasi - static ac drive conditions , is to decrease the refrigeration of the normal conductor , and also to change , usually to increase , the magnitude of heat dissipation in the superconductor .",

    "the calculations were performed by setting the temperature at @xmath146 . ]",
    "we now turn to the effect of a finite dc voltage @xmath7 combined with an ac modulation on the heat current exiting the n electrode . in figs .",
    "[ fig7](a ) and ( b ) , the time - average @xmath157 at large temperatures ( @xmath146 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath7 for several values of frequency at @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig7](a ) shows that @xmath157 is nearly constant having a weak maximum around @xmath170 almost independently of the frequency , and rapidly decreasing thereafter . by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) it clearly appears that , at @xmath146 , @xmath157 is maximized around @xmath171 , so it seems that a finite value of @xmath7 just adds to the ac voltage making the heat current to move along the voltage characteristic similarly to the pure ac case .",
    "furthermore , we note that the addition of a static dc potential to an ac modulation is not able to recover the maximum value the heat current can achieve with only the ac voltage biasing . a confirmation of this is given in the plots displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) which are relative to a value of @xmath169 .",
    "for such an ac voltage biasing @xmath157 does not present a constant part , and the addition of @xmath7 turns out to only suppress the time - average heat current .",
    "moreover , an increase of frequency @xmath152 causes a reduction of @xmath157 , even to negative values .",
    "we finally plot in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the maximum value of @xmath157 , obtained by spanning over @xmath3 , as a function of @xmath172 for several values of frequency . for every @xmath152",
    "the time - average @xmath157 is a bell - shaped function presenting a maximum around @xmath173 ( similarly to what happens in the static @xcite as well as in the quasi - static limit ) , which is gradually suppressed upon enhancing the frequency . by increasing the frequency",
    "the curves slightly shrink , thus reducing the temperature interval of positive heat current .",
    "moreover , the position of the maxima tends to move to higher temperatures for intermediate frequencies ( i.e. , for @xmath152 below @xmath174 ghz ) , while they tend to move to lower temperatures in the higher range of frequencies ( see for example the curve corresponding to @xmath148 ghz in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .    , maximized with respect to @xmath3 , as a function of temperature @xmath172 at @xmath144 for different values of frequency @xmath152 . the static case and the quasi - static limit",
    "are plotted for comparison . ]",
    "in this paper we have calculated the heat currents in a normal / superconductor tunnel junction driven by an oscillating bias voltage in the photon - assisted tunneling regime .",
    "we have found that the maximum heat extracted from the normal electrode decreases with increasing driving frequency .",
    "we checked that for small frequencies ( @xmath175 ) the photon - assisted heat current approaches the quasi - static limit , the latter being obtained by averaging the static heat current over a sinusoidal voltage cycle ( relevant for sub - ghz frequencies ) .",
    "the suppression of the heat current by photon - assisted processes can be imputed to the ac power , dissipated at the tunnel contact , which is enhanced in the quantum regime with respect to the quasi - static limit . on the contrary , the heat current entering the superconducting electrode slightly increases with increasing frequency .",
    "we also found that , for small temperatures , the heat current as a function of the inverse of frequency presents an additional structure consisting of superimposed oscillations with a period corresponding to the time scale derived from the superconducting gap , @xmath164 .",
    "we want finally to briefly comment onto some implications of the above results for practically realizeable systems .",
    "we refer , for instance , to ac - driven nis electron refrigerators operating in the regime of coulomb blockade which were theoretically investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and experimentally demonstrated in ref . @xcite .",
    "more in particular , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that both the heat current flowing out the n island and the minimum achievable electron temperature depend on the frequency of the gate voltage as well as on the bath temperature .",
    "our results may thus suggest the proper operating conditions in terms of frequencies and bath temperatures in order for photon - assisted tunneling not to suppress the heat current in these systems .",
    "in other words , they allow to predict a suitable range of parameters which keep the system in the quasi - static limit .",
