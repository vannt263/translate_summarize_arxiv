    "the problem of thermoconvective instabilities in fluid layers driven by a temperature gradient has become a classical subject in fluid mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is well known that two different effects are responsible for the onset of motion when the temperature difference becomes larger than a certain threshold : gravity and capillary forces . when both effects are taken into account the problem",

    "numerically hydrodynamical problems in the primitive variable formulation raises two questions , one is the handling of first order derivatives for pressure and the other is finding its boundary conditions @xcite , which are not intuitive . in thermoconvective problems pressure",
    "usually is avoided , for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite the method of potentials of velocity is used to eliminate it from the equations .",
    "this technique raises the order of the differential equations and additional boundary conditions may be required .",
    "this is particularly troublesome in cylindrical coordinates where high order derivatives cause awkward difficulties . in ref .",
    "@xcite the primitive variables formulation is used although the use of a particular spectral method allows the removal of pressure . in ref .",
    "@xcite the linear stability analysis of two convection problems are solved in the primitive variables formulation and taking appropriate boundary conditions for pressure . in this article very good accuracy",
    "is obtained both for cartesian and cylindrical coordinates .",
    "this method has been succesfully applied to describe experimental results in cylindrical containers @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this method to study a bm problem in a cylinder heated laterally .    the physical set up ( fig .",
    "1 ) consists of a fluid filling up a container bounded by two concentric cylinders .",
    "the upper surface is open to the air and the fluid is heated laterally through the lateral walls which are conducting .",
    "this set up corresponds to the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and also it is comparable to similar experiments in rectangular containers @xcite . in @xcite a similar problem",
    "is treated theoretically , however in this work rotation is considered and the gravity field is along the radial coordinate . in the problem we treat ,",
    "as soon as a slight difference of temperature is imposed between the lateral walls , a stationary solution appears which is called basic state .",
    "when the temperature of the walls is modified the basic state can become unstable and bifurcate to different patterns , both stationary and oscillatory .",
    "when the bifurcation is stationary , the emerging pattern consists of a 3d structure of rolls whose axes are parallel to the radial coordinate ( radial rolls ) and in the oscillatory case , the axes are tilted with respect the radial axis .",
    "these results coincide with those obtained experimentally @xcite .",
    "the basic state is calculated solving a set of nonlinear equations whereby the first contribution is obtained by a linear approach . to improve the solution we expand the corrections of the unknown fields in chebyshev polynomials , and we pose the equations at the gauss - lobatto collocation points @xcite .",
    "the bifurcation thresholds are obtained through a generalized eigenvalue problem with the same chebyshev collocation method .",
    "the convergence of the method is studied by comparing different expansions .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the formulation of the problem with the equations and boundary conditions is explained . in the third section",
    "the basic state is calculated and the results obtained are discussed for different physical conditions . in the fourth section",
    "the linear stability of the basic solution is performed and instabilities are studied for different parameters . in the fifth section conclusions are detailed .",
    "the physical set up considered is shown in fig .",
    "1 . a horizontal fluid layer of depth @xmath0 ( @xmath1",
    "coordinate ) is in a container bounded by two concentric cylinders of radii @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 coordinate ) .",
    "the bottom plate is rigid and the top is open to the atmosphere .",
    "the inner cylinder has a temperature @xmath5 whereas the outer one is at @xmath6 and the environment is at @xmath7 .",
    "we define @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are the main two parameters controlling instabilities in this problem .",
    "the system evolves according to the momentum and mass balance equations and to the energy conservation principle . in the equations governing the system",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the components of the velocity field @xmath13 of the fluid , @xmath14 the temperature , @xmath15 the pressure , @xmath16 the radio vector and @xmath17 the time are denoted .",
    "the magnitudes are expressed in dimensionless form after rescaling in the following form : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the thermal diffusivity , @xmath24 the kinematic viscosity of the liquid and @xmath25 is the mean density at the environment temperature @xmath26 .",
    "the governing dimensionless equations ( the primes in the corresponding fields have been dropped ) are the continuity equation , @xmath27 the energy balance equation , @xmath28 the navier - stokes equations , @xmath29 where the operators and fields are expressed in cylindrical coordinates @xcite and @xmath30 is the unit vector in the @xmath1 direction . here",
    "the oberbeck - bousinesq approximation has been used .",
    "it consist of considering only in the buoyant term , the following density dependence on temperature @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 is the thermal expansion coefficient .",
    "the following dimensionless numbers have been introduced : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gravity constant .",
    "@xmath35 is the prandtl number which is assumed to have a large value and @xmath36 the rayleigh number , representative of the buoyancy effect .",
    "we discuss now the boundary conditions ( bc ) .",
    "the top surface is flat , which implies the following condition on the velocity , @xmath37 the variation of the surface tension with temperature is considered : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the surface tension at temperature @xmath40 @xmath41 is the constant rate of change of surface tension with temperature ( @xmath41 is positive for most current liquids ) .",
    "this effect supplies the marangoni conditions for the velocity fields which in dimensionless form are , @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the marangoni number . in our particular problem the rayleigh and",
    "the marangoni numbers are related in the same way as in the experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath44 , so buoyancy effects are dominant .",
    "the remaining boundary conditions correspond to rigid walls and are expressed as follows , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    for temperature",
    "we consider the dimensionless form of newton s law for heat exchange at the surface , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the biot number . at the bottom",
    "a linear profile is imposed , @xmath50 while in the lateral walls conducting boundary conditions are considered @xmath51 > from this boundary conditions it is clear how not only @xmath52 defining the rayleigh number is involved in the problem , but also @xmath53 . due to the fact that pressure is kept in the equations ,",
    "additional boundary conditions are needed .",
    "they are obtained by the continuity equation at @xmath54 and the normal component of the momentum equations on @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "as soon as the lateral walls are at different temperatures and a horizontal temperature gradient is set at the bottom , a stationary convective motion appears in the fluid .",
    "in contrast to the classical bnard - marangoni problem with uniform heating , here the basic state is not conductive , but convective . in order to calculate it , for computational convenience ,",
    "the following change has been performed : @xmath61 and @xmath62 which transforms the domain @xmath63 \\times \\left [ 0,2\\pi \\right ] \\times   \\left[0,1\\right]$ ] into @xmath64 \\times \\left [ 0,2\\pi \\right ] \\times \\left [ -1,1\\right ] $ ] .",
    "after these changes , and since the basic state has radial symmetry ( there is no dependence on @xmath65 ) the steady state equations in the infinite prandtl number approach become ( the primes have been dropped ) , @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the boundary conditions are now as follows , @xmath71      we have solved numerically eqs .",
    "( [ 1])-([5 ] ) together with the boundary conditions ( [ 1bc])-([6bcbis ] ) by a chebyshev collocation method .",
    "this approximation is given by four perturbation fields @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 which are expanded in a truncated series of orthonormal chebyshev polynomials : @xmath76 expressions ( [ a1])-([a4 ] ) are replaced into the equations ( [ 1])-([5 ] ) and boundary conditions ( [ 1bc])-([6bc ] ) .",
    "the @xmath77 gauss - lobato points @xmath78 in the @xmath4 axis and the @xmath79 gauss - lobato points @xmath80 in the @xmath1 axis are calculated .",

    "@xcite , in this way @xmath81 equations are obtained with @xmath82 unknowns .",
    "the system has not maximun rank because pressure is only determined up to a constant value .",
    "since this value is not affecting to the other physical magnitudes , we replace the evaluation of the normal component of the momentum equations at ( @xmath83 @xmath84 ) by a value for the pressure at this point , for instance @xmath85 . to solve the resulting nonlinear equatins ,",
    "a newton - like iterative method is used . in a first step",
    "the nonlinearity is discounted and a solution is found by solving the linear system .",
    "it is corrected by small perturbation fields : @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath90 in such way that solutions at @xmath91 step are obtained after solving eqs .",
    "( [ 1])-([6bc ] ) linearized around the approach at step @xmath92",
    ". the considered criterion of convergence is that the difference between two consecutive approximations in @xmath93 norm should be smaller than @xmath94      previous theoretical works @xcite dealing with this problem have approached the basic state solution as a parallel flow , where only the horizontal component of the velocity field exists .",
    "this approach requires the imposition of a constant temperature gradient over all the fluid layer and at the top boundary . in those descriptions",
    "this gradient becomes the main control parameter . in our model",
    "lateral effects are considered , so parallel flow is no longer valid and no restrictions are needed in the temperature boundary conditions which , as explained in the previous section , is the usual newton law .",
    "this boundary condition is the origin of two control parameters related to temperature , i. e. , @xmath53 and @xmath52 .",
    "this possibility , which had been already addressed in @xcite , is explored in detail in the next section .",
    "we have found two types of basic states . the first one , displayed in fig .",
    "2 shows the isotherms obtained at @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the bottom profile is linear , as expected from the boundary condition , however at the top it approaches the constant ambient temperature , since the biot number is large .",
    "this field is similar to that of the layer heated from below , i.e. roughly speaking hotter at the bottom .",
    "this feature is shared with the _ linear flow _ described in @xcite .",
    "3 shows the velocity fields for the same conditions .",
    "they are formed by two co - rotative rolls perpendicular to the gradient .",
    "this result is similar to that obtained in experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , where co - rotative rolls perpendicular to the gradient are found as well .",
    "these results coincide with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for a rectangular geometry .    the second kind of basic state is represented in fig . 4 for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "the most striking feature is that along the vertical axis there are changes in the sign of the temperature gradient .",
    "it seems that the biot number is not dissipating heat effectively at the top and then heat is advected by the velocity field .",
    "this temperature profile coincides with that of the _ return flow _ defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the role of the transport of heat by the velocity field as the origin of the instability is discussed .",
    "as we will demonstrate in the next section this flow becomes unstable through an oscillatory bifurcation , as it is also reported in @xcite .",
    "crucial to the appearence of the two different flows described in this section , is not only the biot number that dissipates heat at the top , but also the role of parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 which introduces heat into the system .",
    "5 shows a transition between the two states we have just described .",
    "it is obtained at @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 . at this stage",
    "the flow already becomes unstable through an oscillatory bifurcation .",
    "the stability of the basic state is studied by perturbing it with a vector field depending on the @xmath106 and @xmath1 coordinates , in a fully 3d analysis : @xmath107 here the superscript @xmath108 indicates the corresponding quantity in the basic state and the bar refers to the perturbation .",
    "we have considered fourier modes expansions in the angular direction , because along it the boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "we replace the expressions ( [ 10])-([50 ] ) into the basic equations and after linearizing the resulting system , we obtain the following eigenvalue problem ( the bars have been dropped ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "the following boundary conditions for the pertubations are obtained , @xmath111 together with @xmath112      the eigenvalue problem is discretized with the chebyshev collocation method used for the basic state .",
    "now there is a new field , the angular velocity , which is expanded as follows , @xmath113 in order to calculate the eigenfunctions and thresholds of the generalized eigenvalue problem the equations are posed at the collocation points according to the rules explained in @xcite , so that a total of @xmath114 algebraic equations are obtained with the same number of unknowns . if the coefficients of the unknowns which form the matrices @xmath115 and @xmath49 satisfy det@xmath116 , a nontrivial solution of the linear homogeneous system exists",
    "this condition generates a dispersion relation @xmath117 , equivalent to calculate directly the eigenvalues from the system @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the vector which contains the unknowns .",
    "if re@xmath120 the basic state is stable while if re@xmath121 the basic state becomes unstable . in the appendix a study of the convergence of the thresholds calculated with this method is shown .",
    "the basic solutions obtained in section 3 , become unstable when the control parameter , @xmath52 in this work , is increased . when @xmath52 is changed , @xmath53 which is not the control parameter in our choice , is fixed to a non zero value . in the explored parameter range two types of bifurcations take place : stationary and oscillatory .",
    "figure 6 depicts the m dependence of re@xmath122 for @xmath95 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 at the threshold ( @xmath125 ) and below it ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the bifurcation is stationary since the imaginary part of the eigenvalue @xmath127 is zero at the critical value m@xmath128 .",
    "figure 7 is similar to figure 6 but at @xmath129 , @xmath103 and @xmath130 and @xmath131 . now",
    "the bifurcation is oscillatory since the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is non zero at the critical value m@xmath132 . in order to understand how physical conditions affect the instability , fig . 8",
    "summarizes the influence of heat related parameters in the bifurcation .",
    "there , it is shown the critical value of @xmath133 , as a function of the biot number @xmath49 , for several values of @xmath53 . in this figure",
    "stationary and oscillatory bifurcations are observed and it shows that having one or other transition depends on an equilibrium between these parameters .",
    "travelling waves are favoured by systems storing a lot of heat , i.e. , low values of the biot number , and high values of @xmath134 , which facilitates the transport of heat by the velocity field @xcite .",
    "we notice here the novelty of these results , where transitions between stationary rolls and oscillatory waves are due to changes in heat related parameters .",
    "this has not been reported in any experimental or theoretical work before , where transitions have been found due to variations in prandtl number @xcite or in aspect ratio @xcite .    in fig . 8",
    "it is also clear that thresholds decrease as @xmath49 increases while the dependence of thresholds on @xmath53 is not monotonous , it presents a minimum for @xmath135 as figure 9 a ) displays . in fig .",
    "9 b ) it is shown how the critical wavenumber increases with @xmath53 , on the other hand it remains almost constant with @xmath49 .    the geometry and size of the box is also affecting the instability as it is noticed mainly in low aspect ratio systems . although a detailed study of patterns in small containers is beyond the scope of this work , table i gives an insight into it .",
    "it shows the critical value of @xmath133 and the corresponding critical wavenumber m@xmath136 for some @xmath137 . the wavenumber does not change monotonously with the aspect ratio , as also happens in small containers with uniform heating from below @xcite as well .",
    "the critical wavenumber for the stationary bifurcation shows that a 3d structure appears which consists of radial rolls whose axes are parallel to the radial coordinate as fig .",
    "10 shows for @xmath95 and @xmath96 and @xmath138c .",
    "the growing perturbation along the transverse plane is plotted in fig .",
    "11 , where a structure appears near the hot side as in the experiment reported in @xcite .",
    "this is so because , in this case , the instability has the same origin as a static fluid heated from below , so since the vertical temperature gradient is greater at this boundary , perturbation grows there first . on the other hand",
    "since the hot cylinder counteracts the vertical temperature gradient it inhibits the instability threshold .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in similar conditions but in a cartesian geometry . in that article at a threshold @xmath139c , the critical wavenumber is @xmath140 , which would correspond to @xmath141 periods respectively in the inner and outer radii of an annulus as ours .",
    "this matches rather well with our critical threshold and wavenumber which is @xmath142 , suggesting that , at least for this aspect ratio , geometry does not strongly affect the results .",
    "these results and discussions of the stationary bifurcation are in good agreement with those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also obtain oscillatory bifurcations .",
    "for instance , there is one at @xmath96 ( @xmath143 mm ) , @xmath144c , @xmath129 and @xmath145c , which corresponds to travelling waves or hydrothermal waves described in refs .",
    "@xcite . fig .",
    "12 depicts the eigenfunction along the transverse plane , where the tilted axis of the waves can be seen .",
    "this result is comparable to that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where for a cartesian container with @xmath146 mm , @xmath147 mm , hydrothermal waves of wavenumber @xmath148 , emerge above a threshold .",
    "this would correspond to a pattern with @xmath149 periods in the inner and outer radii of our annulus respectively , which is not far from our critical wavenumber m@xmath150 .",
    "the angle of inclination of the waves in fig .",
    "10 is @xmath151 also close to that of @xmath152 rad of ref .",
    "we have studied a bm lateral heating problem in a cylindrical annulus .",
    "the problem has been solved with a chebyshev collocation method by keeping the original navier - stokes equations , where appropriate boundary conditions are required for pressure @xcite .",
    "the scheme developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for stability problems has been extended to calculate a non trivial basic state .",
    "the procedure is confirmed to be reliable , effective and easy to implement .",
    "we have obtained two kinds of basic solutions .",
    "one type is formed by co - rotative rolls such as those reported in experiments @xcite , and in similar theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the second kind of solution has similar features to those of the _ return flow _ described in @xcite .",
    "the linear stability analysis of these solutions shows stationary bifurcations to radial rolls and oscillatory bifurcations to hydrothermal waves , whose appearance has been proved to depend on their heat related parameters ( @xmath49 , @xmath53 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "this fact has not been adressed before , perhaps because experimentally these parameters are hard to manipulate .",
    "properties of the growing patterns coincide with those reported in previous works .",
    "stationary solutions appear in basic flows with temperature profiles close to the static fluid heated from below @xcite .",
    "their wavenumbers are in the range of experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite . also the structure in the @xmath153 plane",
    "agrees with previous results @xcite .",
