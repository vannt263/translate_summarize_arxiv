    "the targets are in a bath of liquid helium that is cooled by the refrigerator .    to maintain reasonable target polarization , the beam current was limited to 100  na and was uniformly rastered .",
    "the uniformity of the raster was obtained by independently and simultaneously rastering at a fast frequency ( 17.9  khz in vertical direction and 24.2  khz in the horizontal direction ) over 1  mm square spot and slow frequency ( 30  hz ) over 0.9  cm maximum radius spiral pattern .",

    "the protons have a slow relaxation time compared to the electrons and slowly the polarization of the protons builds up . the spin vector of the polarized protons is aligned parallel or anti - parallel to the field direction by changing the frequency of the microwaves and measurements were done at both microwave frequencies . for this data",

    "@xmath49 was determined separately for the bottom and top target , since each target has an individual nmr setup .",

    "three separate series of te measurements were done for one target at different times and the standard deviation was found to be 2.9% .",
    "this was used as the relative systematic error on the target polarization for both targets .",
    "the accelerator at jefferson lab produces highly polarized beam that can be simultaneously delivered to all three experimental halls .",
    "the polarized beam was produced by photo - emission from a semiconductor cathode using polarized laser light from a pulsed diode laser .",
    "each hall had its own diode laser which produces a narrow pulse , but a small continuous noise was also present .",

    "the ratio of the two rates is a measure of the leakage current . throughout the experiment",
    "the leakage current was measured every 12 hours and on average the leakage current was found to be 2% of the total current .",
    "this is the leakage current from both halls  a and b.    the polarization of electrons produced at the cathode depends on the laser wavelength . at the time of this",
    "experiment , hall  a wanted high current and was not interested in polarized beam , while halls b and c wanted low current and polarized beam .",
    "the wavelength of the laser chosen for the hall  a system produced a high current beam with @xmath50  35% polarization which is about half the beam polarization for hall  c. a 2% leakage current from hall  a dilutes the hall  c beam polarization by about 1% .",
    "since both hall  b and c were at the same laser wavelength , the beam polarization at the injector is the same for halls  b and c. this means that hall  b leakage current does not effect the polarization of beam to hall  c , but changes to the relative amount from halls  a and b to the total leakage current in hall  c does change the hall  c beam polarization .",
    "there was no measurement of the relative amount of leakage current from halls  a and b in the total measured leakage current .",
    "in addition to dilution from leakage current , the longitudinal beam polarization at the hall  c target depends on the energy per pass , the number of passes and the setting the spin rotator in the injector which was set to maximize the product of longitudinal beam polarization in halls  b and c. therefore , to accurately know the beam polarization in hall  c , a measurement must be made near the hall  c target .",
    "the beam polarization , @xmath51 , was measured in hall  c using the mller polarimeter  @xcite .",
    "mller measurements were taken when the target was retracted from the beam for annealing .",

    "the measurements were taken throughout the run period and are plotted in fig .",

    "the average @xmath51 was @xmath52% and was used to determine the elastic asymmetry in eq .",

    "the beam polarization was assumed to be constant throughout the perpendicular target field running and no time dependent nor run - by - run adjustment to the beam polarization was done .",
    "the relative systematic error for the mller measurement is 0.7% .",
    "the beam polarization could be different during the mller measurements and the actual running due to changing leakage currents in halls  a and b. if the leakage current was mainly from hall  b then there would be no dependence of the hall  c beam polarization on leakage current .",
    "the worse case would be assuming that the leakage current is dominantly from hall  a. with that condition and assuming that leakage varies from 0% to 4% then an estimate of the relative systematic error on the beam polarization from changes in the leakage current is 1% . combining these errors in quadrature",

    "the electrons scattered toward the hms are bent downward and have an average out - of - plane angle of 3.4@xmath45 .    normally , the position , angle and momentum of the scattered electron are determined by measuring hms focal plane position and angles of the electron and then reconstructing the target quantities using an optics matrix .",
    "in addition , the hms optics matrix takes into account the vertical position of the beam at the target .",
    "the calculation of momentum and out - of - plane angle are sensitive to the vertical position .",
    "the hms optics matrix has been determined without the target field .",
    "the effect of the target field can be mimicked by using a effective vertical position at the target with the known hms optics matrix in an iterative procedure .",
