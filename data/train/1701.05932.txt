    "one of the most interesting features of topological matter is fractionalization . in non - topological materials we usually expect that the quantum numbers of excitations are multiples of the quantum numbers of constituent particles . for example",

    "the success of that model is puzzling given strongly interacting nature of the fractional quantum hall physics .",

    "( [ noise-2 ] ) solely from the basic principles of statistical mechanics without any reference to a particular model .",
    "we next consider the opposite limit of @xmath26 .",

    "the relation holds for any chiral system , such as a qhe edge , and its derivation does not depend on a model .",

    "in such a physical picture , electrons and not fractional quasiparticles tunnel at qpc in the right - left direction with a small backscattering rate @xmath12 .",

    "fractional quasiparticles are excitations of a strongly - correlated electron system",

    "the direction of the tunneling current is from the left to the right in fig .",
    "equation ( [ noise-5 ] ) can be rewritten in the form , similar to ( [ noise-2-add ] ) , with both the average and differential transparencies .",
    "the above derivation relies on the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite whose proof assumes chiral edges , such as the edges at the filling factors @xmath6 and @xmath61 but not @xmath62 and @xmath0 . for a judiciously chosen experimental setup , our results also hold for nonchiral edges as discussed in the appendix .",

    "<S> we also derive an approximate model - independent formula for shot noise in the regime of intermediate backscattering . </S>",
    "<S> the equation is numerically close to the standard ` noninteracting ' fitting formula but suggests a different physical interpretation of the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> we verify our theoretical predictions with a shot noise experiment at the filling factor @xmath0 . </S>"
