    "generalized non - hermitian eigenvalue problems of the form @xmath0 arise in many important applications of applied sciences and engineering that include economic modeling , markov chain modeling , structural engineering , fluid mechanics , material science , and more ( see  @xcite for example ) . solving complex - symmetric ( still non - hermitian ) eigenvalue problems are crucial in modeling open systems based on the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) technique that is staple tool in electromagnetics nanoelectronics  @xcite , and micro electromechanical systems mems  @xcite . as a tool in numerical linear algebra , non - hermitian eigensolvers are kernels to non - linear eigenvalue problems such as quadratic or polynomial eigenvalue problems  @xcite .",
    "more generally , advances in high - performance and big - data computing will only increase the use for general eigenvalue solvers in areas such as bioinformatics , social network , data mining , just to name a few .",
    "compared to the hermitian case , the arsenal of solvers available for non - hermitian eigenproblems are much more meager .",
    "any addition to the software toolbox for the general scientific computing is therefore always timely and welcome .    for eigenproblems of moderate size",
    ", robust solvers are well developed and widely available  @xcite and are sometimes referred to as direct solvers  @xcite .",
    "these solvers typically calculate the entire spectrum of the matrix or matrix pencil in question . in many applications , especially for those where the underlying linear systems are large and sparse , often only selected regions of the spectrum are of interest .",
    "a new approach for these calculations for hermitian matrices and matrix pencils based on density matrices has been proposed recently  @xcite . unlike well - known krylov subspace methods",
    "( see for example  @xcite ) which maintain subspaces of increasing dimensions , the feast algorithm maintains a basis for a fixed - dimension subspace but updates it per iteration .",
    "in this view , it is similar to the non - expanding subspace version of an eigensolver based on trace minimization  @xcite but with a different subspace update strategy . from an implementation point of view , this new approach is similar to spectral divide - and - conquer  @xcite in that the calculation is expressed in terms of high - level building blocks that can much better exploit the advantages of modern computing architectures . in this case , the high - level building block is a numerical - quadrature based technique to approximate an exact spectral projector .",
    "this building block consists of solving independent linear systems , each for multiple right hand sides .",
    "a software package feast based on this approach has been made available since 2009 .",
    "a comprehensive theoretical analysis of hermitian feast has been completed very recently  @xcite by two of the authors of this present work .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the feast algorithm and theory to tackle non - hermitian generalized eigenproblems . similar to the hermitian case",
    ", the non - hermitian feast algorithm takes the form of standard subspace iteration in conjunction with the rayleigh - ritz procedure ( see for example  @xcite , page 157 , or  @xcite , page 115 . ) for non - hermitian problems , left and right eigenvectors are in general different .",
    "there are two natural generalizations of subspace iterations to handle this complication .",
    "a one - sided approach where one focuses on either the right or left invariant subspace , or a bauer bi - iteration approach where both invariant subspaces are targeted simultaneously .",
    "the crucial ingredient is that the subspace iteration here is carried out on an approximate spectral projector obtained by numerical quadrature .",
    "our analysis shows that the quadrature approximation perturbs the projector s eigenvalues but not the eigenvectors .",
    "consequently , the convergence of subspace iteration can be established similar to the approaches shown in  @xcite , suitably generalized as the left and right eigenspaces are now different . by exploring the structure of the generated subspaces ,",
    "we show that the rayleigh - ritz procedure produces the targeted eigenpairs .",
    "typical to many large - scale applications , the target eigenpairs are a small portion of the entire spectrum . in this case , the dominant work of our algorithm is the quadrature computation which possesses multiple levels of parallelism , making this an excellent algorithm for high - performance computing .",
    "this paper aims to show how the various components of non - hermitian feast fit together , stating the relevant mathematical properties without rigorous proofs .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis similar to  @xcite for the hermitian case is beyond the scope here . in subsequent sections we will describe the numerical - quadrature - based method to compute approximate spectral projectors , state the convergence properties of subspace iteration and the associated rayleigh - ritz procedure with this approximate projector as an accelerator , and present numerical and performance examples .",
    "throughout this paper , we consider the generalized eigenvalue problem specified by two @xmath1 matrices @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 invertible .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is diagonalizable with an eigendecomposition @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues in some order .",
    "@xmath8 is a set of corresponding right eigenvectors , @xmath9 .",
    "define @xmath10 by @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the conjugate transpose of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath10 is a set of corresponding left eigenvectors @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath15 it is customary to describe the relationship @xmath11 as @xmath8 and @xmath16 being bi - orthogonal .",
    "consider that the eigenvalues of interest , totaling @xmath17 of them , are those that reside inside a simply connected domain @xmath18 ( e.g. disk , ellipse , etc . ) .",
    "we further assume that none of the eigenvalues @xmath19 are on the boundary @xmath20 of @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be a corresponding set of right and left eigenvectors , respectively . in particular , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath23 matrices with @xmath24 .",
    "our strategy is motivated by the spectral projectors onto the invariant subspaces @xmath25 of @xmath5 and @xmath26 of @xmath27 , respectively . in matrix form , these projectors are @xmath28 and @xmath29 . more specifically ,",
    "suppose we could compute @xmath30 for any @xmath31-vector @xmath32 , then we can apply @xmath28 to a set of random vectors @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath34 .",
    "if it happens that @xmath35 , then @xmath36 . one can then obtain a basis @xmath37 for @xmath25 , for example by performing a rank - revealing factorization .",
    "thus @xmath37 must be of the form @xmath38 for some @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 .",
    "construct a reduced - size eigenproblem @xmath41 where @xmath42 it is easy to see from equation  ( [ eqn : eigendecomposition ] ) that @xmath43 .",
    "solving the reduced - size problem for @xmath44 and @xmath40 yields the eigenvalues of interest and the eigenvectors @xmath21 , which are given by @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , the projector @xmath29 can lead to a basis @xmath46 . construct the reduced - size generalized eigenproblem @xmath41 , @xmath47 solving @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 yields @xmath44 and @xmath51 .",
    "finally , if we employ both projectors to obtain basis @xmath37 and @xmath52 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , then we can construct @xmath53 the eigenvalues of the reduced problem is @xmath44 and the right and left eigenvectors are @xmath40 and @xmath50 , respectively .    while the exact spectral projectors are not readily available , we show how we can approximate them based on rational approximations to a cauchy integral via quadrature rules . applying these approximate projectors",
    "is tantamount to solving multiple independent linear systems each with multiple right - hand - sides  a procedure that is inherently parallel in multiple levels .",
    "furthermore , the approximate spectral projectors in fact preserve the invariant subspaces @xmath25 and @xmath26 exactly . consequently , performing subspace iteration or bauer bi - iteration with the approximate spectral projector becomes numerically effective as well as computationally efficient in capturing invariant subspaces as well as the associated eigenpairs .",
    "the general flow of the remaining sections is as follows . in section  [ sec : asp_via_quad ]",
    ", we construct the approximate spectral projectors and analyze their properties .",
    "section  [ sec : subspace_iteration ] presents several variants of the approximate - spectral - projector - accelerated subspace iteration algorithms adapted for generalized non - hermitian eigenvalue problems .",
    "we state the basic convergence properties of these methods .",
    "we present in section  [ sec : experiments ] a number of numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical analysis .",
    "scalability results are also presented , supporting our claim that this building block is a great addition to the overall toolbox for hpc calculation of non - hermitian eigenvalue problems . in the concluding section ,",
    "we put our new method in the context of other popular existing methods and share our views of future work .",
    "we focus first on the right projector @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath54 be a rational function in partial fraction form where @xmath55 for all the @xmath56s .",
    "the standard definition of @xmath57 applied to the matrix @xmath58 is @xmath59 the last equality holds because @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 has the obvious meaning of the diagonal matrix with entries @xmath62 . if it happens that @xmath63 for all eigenvalues @xmath64 and @xmath65 for all eigenvalues @xmath66 , then in fact @xmath67 . in the following ,",
    "we construct a function @xmath62 such that @xmath68 for @xmath64 and @xmath69 for @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , the resulting @xmath70 approximates the spectral projector @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the complex - valued function defined by the cauchy integral ( in the counter clockwise direction ) @xmath72 the cauchy integral theorem shows that @xmath73 for @xmath74 inside the @xmath18 and @xmath75 for @xmath74 outside of @xmath18 .",
    "it is therefore natural to approximate the integral in equation  ( [ eqn : cauchy_contour ] ) by a quadrature rule . to simplify the exposition , we focus on elliptical contours @xmath20 parameterized by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the center , with horizontal and vertical axes of lengths @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",

    "bi - feast is the  bullish - but - riskier \" sibling of the more conservative r - feast . for well - conditioned problems ,",
    "bi - feast offers faster convergence of eigenvalues ; r - feast , however , is just as fast in producing small residuals .",
    "both are useful and complement each other .",
    "we note here that bi - feast was experimented in  @xcite by laux , but without theoretical explanation .",
    "feast has a number of signature features . by nature",
    "it works equally well regardless whether the targeted spectrum consists of dominant eigenvalues or not .",
    "it zooms in on all the targets simultaneously , at practically the same rapid convergence rate .",
    "the dimension of the subspaces , as well as the linear systems that need to be solved remained unchanged throughout a fixed targeted domain @xmath18 .",
    "although the linear systems are of the form @xmath232 , they are not shifts in the familiar sense .",
    "the @xmath233s are not meant to be close to any eigenvalues but merely correspond to nodes of a numerical quadrature rule . under ideal situations , they are",
    "not near any eigenvalues and none of the linear systems is ill - conditioned .",
    "every one of these features is distinct from those associated with popular non - hermitian eigensolvers such as unsymmetric lanczos  @xcite , arnoldi  @xcite , or jacobi - davidson  @xcite .",
    "feast is fundamentally based on subspace iteration , whereas  @xcite , despite their use of quadrature techniques , are more related to krylov methods .",
    "the quadratures there are used to approximate higher - order matrix moments .",
    "in contrast , the quadratures used in feast are used to approximate the zeroth moments , which correspond to spectral projectors .",
    "the feast algorithms require the user to set a subspace dimension @xmath183 , which should exceed @xmath17 , the number of eigenvalues in @xmath18 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath183 is often chosen based on a priori knowledge or experience , or trial - and - error .",
    "a more elaborate theory exists , similar to those detailed in  @xcite for the hermitian case , on estimation of the @xmath17 .",
    "for example , one can use the eigenvalues of @xmath234 ( @xmath235 from steps 4 and 5 of bi - feast ) to estimate the eigenvalue count @xmath17 .",
    "opportunities for further work present themselves naturally , in the directions of approximation theory , matrix analysis and parallel computing . at feast s",
    "core is a rational function close to 1 inside a domain @xmath18 , and 0 outside .",
    "here we have used either a gauss or trapezoidal quadrature rule to construct this rational function .",
    "in general , possibility abounds for other quadrature rules , either general or domain , @xmath18 , specific ( see  @xcite for example ) .",
    "alternatively , one can view this as a function approximation problem .",
    "chebyshev polynomials",
    "@xcite which work well on the real line ( for hermitian problems ) would not work on the complex plane in terms of approximating the @xmath71 function in equation ( [ eqn : pi ] ) : polynomials are analytic and must obey the maximum modulus theorem ( see  @xcite for example ) .",
    "rational approximation can contribute fruitfully here .",
    "we have already seen one such case for hermitian problem where zolotarev approximation is shown to outperform gauss quadrature  @xcite .    in non - hermitian matrix computations , it is customary to focus on the class of diagonalizable matrices .",
    "how well a quadrature - based approximate spectral projector handles a general jordan block , and what the resulting implication on feast s convergence behavior in the face of deficient eigenvectors will be , are worthy pursuit that requires classical matrix and perturbation analysis .",
    "last but not least , feast offers multiple levels of parallelism : multiple target domains , multiple linear systems , with multiple right hand sides . exploiting these parallelism fully , automatically ,",
    "require much work still .",
    "on the highest level , fast partitioning of a region in the complex plane to subregions , each containing roughly the same number of eigenvalues , for the obvious sake of load balancing , is nontrivial . challenging software engineering work",
