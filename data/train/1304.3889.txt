    "the formation of galaxies is intimately dependent on the conversion of stars into gas , the production of heavy elements , recycling of this material into the interstellar medium , and repetitions of this cycle .",
    "a detailed understanding of the interplay between each of gas mass , star formation rate , and metallicity is clearly important to understand the galaxy evolution process . scaling relations between sfr and stellar or gas mass , and between mass and metallicity ,",
    "have been explored for many years .",
    "more recently , the connection between gas fraction and metallicity have also begun to be explored @xcite .",
    "identifying the causal relationships between these empirical scaling relations is , however , more challenging .    from the fundamental properties of galaxies",
    ", we can identify extensive ( scale - dependent ) and intensive ( scale - invariant ) properties .",
    "intensive properties are essential or inherent to a system and are independent of the amount of baryonic mass , for example metallicity , temperature , density , and ssfr . extensive properties on the other hand ,",
    "depend on the amount of baryonic mass of the system , such as the star formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar mass ( @xmath0 ) . by way of illustration of this point , if we were to split a galaxy in half , the metallicity of the halves are unchanged from the original galaxy .",
    "the sfr and stellar mass of the halves , however , are half that of the original , corresponding to the amount of baryonic mass removed .",
    "although the metallicity is scale invariant , or intensive , it is related to the stellar mass through the well known @xmath0@xmath1 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this relationship",
    ", the metallicity of high mass systems is higher than that of low mass systems .",
    "this does not mean that the metallicity and @xmath0  are dependent variables . a correlation or trend between an intensive and an extensive property can not be directly causal .",
    "for example , simply combining a large number of low - metalliticy dwarf galaxies will increase the total mass , but will not directly increase the metallicity of the total system .",
    "any such relation , consequently , must imply a common underlying cause , in this example likely to be the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "on the other hand , relationships such as z - sfr & z - ssfr are shown to have weaker correlations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , the z - ssfr relation is formed by intensive properties of galaxies , and has not been widely studied since it shows high scatter . nevertheless , metallicity is important for the ability of gas clouds to form stars , since it enables most of the gas cooling that will facilitate the star formation @xcite .",
    "crucial information regarding galaxy properties is given by their neutral gas content .",
    "large hi surveys such as the arecibo legacy fast arecibo l - band feed array ( alfalfa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the galex arecibo sdss survey ( gass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have provided new scaling relationships and dependencies for the cool gas in galaxies .",
    "the link between the gas metallicity and hi content in galaxies was studied in @xcite . specifically , they study the hi dependence on the @xmath0@xmath1 relation using sdss galaxies .",
    "they estimate empirically the hi content for 10@xmath2 emission ",

    "@xcite confirms this result , from an investigation of the role of cold gas and environment on the @xmath0@xmath1 relation for 260 nearby late  type galaxies .",
    "they find that , at fixed stellar mass , galaxies with lower gas fractions typically also possess higher metallicities .",
    "in general , they observe that gas  poor galaxies are typically more metal rich , and demonstrate that the removal of gas from the outskirts of spirals increases the observed average metallicity by @xmath3 0.1 dex .",
    "athough some scaling relations with hi content have been studied , the interplay between metallicity and ssfr has not yet been analyzed as a function of the gas content or stellar mass .",
    "the z - ssfr relation is formed by intensive properties , and is a key relationship to study the different properties of high and low  mass galaxies .",
    "the gas mass is a direct measure of the available fuel in galaxies to form stars .",
    "the relation of this gas with metallicity , stellar mass , and ssfr can tell us how fast a galaxy assembled stars in the past , the amount of stars it formed , and how actively it is forming stars at present .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to analyse the interplay between all these properties to produce a general picture of the gas recycling process .",

    "the correlation between the amount of metals and the ssfr has not been explored in detail .",

    "[ dependenciabin1p1 ] can be understood assuming that galaxies at a given @xmath0  have different amounts of hi .",
    "based on that figure , we generate the cartoon model shown in fig .",
    "[ cartoonmodel ] . in this model ,",
    "mass galaxies are represented by a blue ellipse that extends from high ssfr and low @xmath31 , to low ssfr and high @xmath31 .",
    "massive galaxies , represented by a red ellipse , extend from low ssfr and low @xmath31 to high ssfr and high @xmath31 .",
    "different physical explanations can be given to justify this basic supposition of our cartoon model .",
    "the presence of galactic inflows and outflows and how they affect the metal enrichment in galaxies is still a matter of debate .",
    "galactic outflows have been shown to be important to reproduce the @xmath0@xmath1 relation of galaxies using analytical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hydrodynamic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , @xcite reproduced the @xmath0@xmath1 relation mainly by means of an increasing efficiency of star formation , without any need to invoke galactic outflows .",
    "a general picture of downsizing suggests that low ",
    "mass galaxies process their gas slower than massive galaxies , therefore low  mass galaxies are actively forming stars , and present high ssfrs today compared to massive galaxies .",
    "hereafter , we will focus on downsizing to provide a possible explanation for the trends between the intensive properties of ssfr and z as a function of the extensive property of mass .    a combination of downsizing and the amount of hi can explain the opposing trends for low and high mass galaxies observed in the z - ssfr relation . focusing our attention on the low  mass galaxy branch ( blue ellipse of fig . [ cartoonmodel ] )",
    ", we can explain the differences in ssfr through the amount of hi present in each galaxy .",
    "mass galaxies with a high amount of neutral gas will show higher ssfr today , as they have more fuel for star formation , than galaxies of the same mass with a lower amount of neutral gas .",
    "the same is applicable to high  mass galaxies ( red ellipse of fig .",
    "[ cartoonmodel ] ) , in this branch , galaxies with a high amount of hi show higher ssfrs than galaxies at the same mass with lower amount of hi .",
    "it is noteworthy however , that @xmath31 plays the opposite role . while low  mass galaxies with a large amount of hi show low @xmath31 , massive galaxies with a large amount of hi show high @xmath31",
    "this can again be explained by downsizing , but not downsizing in stellar mass , rather the amount of hi is driving the rate of metal enrichment in galaxies . in the low  mass branch ,",
    "galaxies with large hi show low @xmath31 because they are processing their gas slower and on longer time scales than galaxies with lower hi for the same stellar mass .",
    "on the other hand , massive galaxies with large hi show higher metallicities because they processed their gas faster in the past and have already reached high @xmath31 , and due to their large hi , they also have a high ssfr too .",
    "to test our model we use the 4491 sdss optical counterparts with direct hi mass measurements from the alfalfa and gass surveys described in @xmath23[hidata ] . for the relationships shown in this section , we define the gas mass as m@xmath32m@xmath33 , and the gas mass fraction as m@xmath34 / ( @xmath35 + m@xmath34 ) .",
    "we generate the z - ssfr relation and show it as a function of the gas mass fraction in fig .",
    "[ cartoonmodel ] ( right ) .",
    "although with our hi sample it is only possible to see the low  mass branch in this relationship , it is clear that the gas mass fraction of galaxies increases as the ssfr increases , consistent with our proposed cartoon model .",
    "black triangles in fig .",
    "[ cartoonmodel ] ( right ) correspond to sdss galaxies in the alfalfa and gass fields with no hi detection and @xmath0@xmath3610@xmath37 m@xmath28 .",
    "a linear fit to these data is given by log(ssfr ) @xmath38 , where @xmath39=12+log(o / h ) .",
    "[ cartoonmodel ] also suggests that there is a relation between the gas mass fraction and the ssfr .",
    "this indicates , regardless of the @xmath0 , that the intrinsic rate at which a galaxy is forming stars depends strongly on the gas mass fraction .",
    "this relationship is shown in fig .",
    "[ higas]a .",
    "galaxies with a high gas mass fraction show a very steep relation with ssfr . on the other hand , galaxies with a low gas mass fraction have uniformly flat and low ssfrs in which the lack of gas would prevent galaxies from forming stars .",
    "indeed , there is an inflection point between this abrupt change at log(ssfr ) @xmath309.9 , in agreement with the dividing line seen in fig .",
    "[ dependenciabin1p1 ] , that motivated the cartoon model of fig .",
    "[ cartoonmodel ] .",
    "the relations between the gas mass fraction with the stellar mass and metallicity are shown in figs . [ higas]b and [ higas]c . similarly to fig .",
    "[ higas]a , these relations show steep and flat tendencies for high and low gas mass fractions , respectively .",
    "galaxies with high gas mass fractions have low metallicities and low  masses .",
    "this suggests , as downsizing indicates , that low ",
    "mass galaxies assemble their stars on longer timescales compared to massive galaxies .",
    "galaxies with very low gas mass fractions , have assembled their stellar mass , exhausted their gas , and reached high stellar masses and high metallicities . as a result , galaxies with low gas mass fraction will show a flat relation against stellar mass and metallicity , as seen in figs .",
    "[ higas]b and [ higas]c , respectively .",
    "to further refine this picture , hi measurements for massive galaxies are necessary .    another way to see",
    "the influence of the gas fraction on metals is through the @xmath0@xmath1 relation shown in fig .",
    "[ mzgas]a .",
    "since low  mass galaxies are actively forming stars they show a high hi gas fraction but low metallicity , while massive galaxies have finished forming stars , exhausting their hi , and reaching high metallicities .",
    "a fit to this relation gives : 12+log(o / h ) @xmath40 , with @xmath39=log(@xmath41 ) .",
    "two important extensive variables analyzed here are the stellar mass and the total hi in galaxies .",
    "the relationship between both is shown in fig .",
    "[ mzgas]b .",
    "it is interesting to note that low ",
    "mass galaxies have a larger amount of mass in hi than in stars , which supports the scenario described in this section .",
    "galaxies with a higher mass in stars were more efficient at forming stars in the past , resulting in a current amount of hi that is relatively smaller , although still larger in an absolute sense , than in low - stellar - mass systems .",
    "a fit to this relation gives : log(m@xmath42/m@xmath28 ) @xmath43 , with @xmath39=log(@xmath41 ) .",
    "a key question to answer to have a general picture of this model is , why do low metallicity galaxies have either high ssfrs or low ssfrs but almost nothing in between ? .",
    "in the picture presented here , galaxies evolve in a downsizing fashion with two independent mechanisms that lead to having a galaxy with low metallicities : ( @xmath44 ) a high  mass galaxy will be at low metallicity today if it exhausted its available fuel for star formation and can no longer continue to enrich its ism .",
    "( @xmath45 ) a low  mass galaxy will be at low metallicity while it slowly forms stars , taking longer to enrich its ism .",
    "these different scenarios lead naturally to the dearth of mid - range ssfrs for the very low metallicity systems .",
    "staying at low - z for massive galaxies means less and less star formation the lower the metallicity needing to be maintained .",
    "vice - versa , for the low - mass galaxies , the metallicity stays low if the system is young and has a high amount of hi and ssfr . as observed in fig .",
    "[ dependenciabin1p1 ] and [ cartoonmodel ] , within the range of stellar masses present at a given metallicity , the lower  mass end will still have higher ssfrs than the higher  mass end , but the difference compared to the lowest metallicities will be reduced .",
    "this is because the higher mass galaxies can have progressively more star formation and still stay at mid - range to higher metallicities , while the lower - mass galaxies could have had a more bursty star formation in the past due to a higher amount of hi , which today would result in a high metallicity , low hi content and hence low ssfr .",
    "@xmath1 relation colour coded from low ( magenta ) to high ( green ) hi/@xmath0  content .",
    "( b ) log(@xmath41 ) vs. log(@xmath46 ) relation colour coded from low ( green ) to high ( magenta ) metallicity.,title=\"fig : \" ] @xmath1 relation colour coded from low ( magenta ) to high ( green ) hi/@xmath0  content .",
    "( b ) log(@xmath41 ) vs. log(@xmath46 ) relation colour coded from low ( green ) to high ( magenta ) metallicity.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we can argue that more star formation increases the metallicity , which is sensible for massive galaxies , in which their ssfr increases as metallicity increases .",
    "it is noteworthy however , that this does not apply for low  mass galaxies , which follow the opposite behavior .",
    "therefore , we propose that galaxies will follow a downsizing scenario in which the hi content is an important driver of their evolution . low ",
    "mass galaxies with a large amount of hi will process their gas on longer timescales and thus show low metallicities today .",
    "on the other hand , low ",
    "mass galaxies with a lower hi might have evolved differently . these galaxies might have experienced a more bursty sf in the past that exhausted their gas and increased their metallicity .",
    "aditionally , a combination of the infall of pristine gas and environment could play an important role here . in this second scenario ,",
    "infall can be more significant for low mass galaxies , diluting their metallicity , and provide pristine fuel for high ssfrs .",
    "it is possible , even perhaps likely , that a combination of such scenarios are at play . to explain the observations presented here , and further explore the cartoon model proposed , more detailed simulations targetted at this problem are necessary"
