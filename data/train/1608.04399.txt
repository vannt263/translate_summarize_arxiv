    "it is well - known that the atomic inversion for a two - level atom interacting with a classical field @xcite undergoes rabi oscillations @xcite , which suffer collapses and revivals when instead of a classical field , a quantised field is considered .",
    "the shape of the revival of rabi oscillations may be considered as an indicator of of the photon distribution of the field being interacted with the two - level atom .",
    "for instance , when a squeezed field is considered , there exist so called ringing revivals of the rabi oscillations that indicate such non - classical field @xcite .",
    "in the case of an initial coherent field , it is well known that its interaction with an initially excited two - level atom , produces , in phase space , the appearance of two counterrotating bumps that , after the so - called half revival time , @xmath0 , produces approximately a superposition of coherent states @xcite . some ( little ) time before @xmath1 , the bumps start to collide , which produces the revival of rabi oscillations . if , instead of an initial coherent state , a superposition of two coherent states is considered , the revival of oscillations is divided by two , and the rabi oscillations occur faster @xcite . however , if instead of the superposition of coherent states , a mixture of coherent states is initially considered , rabi oscillations occur at @xmath1 , just as in the case of a ( single ) coherent state .",
    "although rabi oscillations can give us some information about the initial state of the field , it is not enough , and we in general can not say , for instance , if the initial field was in a pure coherent state or in a mixture of coherent states , because both produce the same atomic inversion .",
    "one then can rely on the entropy triangle inequality @xcite @xmath2 is the entropy of the total system and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the entropies of the subsystems",
    "a and b , respectively . an important implication from this equation is that , if the total entropy is zero , both subsystem s entropies will be equal .",
    "therefore , if in a lossless interaction , one can generate pure initial states for subsystems a and b , their entropies will be equal after evolution .",
    "for instance , in the ( two - level ) atom - field interaction we may be able to find the entropy for the field given by the entropy of the atom .",
    "a question arises : how to compute the field s entropy in the case one of the subsystems , let us say the quantised field , is not in a pure state ? in this case the above triangle inequality can not be applied and there is not a general answer .    phoenix and knight have shown how the field entropy for an initial coherent state can be calculated @xcite analytically . in order to do so , the eigenstates and eigenvalues are obtained from the field density matrix .",
    "moreover , phoenix applied later the same method to compute the entropy for a field subject to decay @xcite .",
    "both calculations are rather complicated procedures even for a pure coherent state .",
    "although decay produces loss of information , it may be shown that information about an initial pure state can be obtained after decay happens @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we study a way to calculate the field entropy for an initial mixture of coherent states .",
    "we obtain analytical results with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "consider the hamiltonian for the on - resonance interaction of an atom and a quantized field @xmath5 where for simplicity we do not take into account the free hamiltonian terms ( atom and field ) , and we only consider the interaction picture .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is the so - called rabi frequency , the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the annihilation and creation operators , and the atomic operators , @xmath9 and @xmath9 are the lowering and raising pauli matrices , respectively .",
    "if we consider an initial coherent state for the field , @xmath10 and an excited state for the atom , we obtain the evolved ( total ) density matrix as @xmath11 where the unnormalized wavefunctions are given by @xmath12 the london phase operator @xcite .",
    "we find the field reduced density matrix as @xmath13 while the atomic density matrix reads @xmath14    phoenix and knight @xcite looked for eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath15 in order to find the field entropy . here",
    "we take a different approach and will find first the field entropy operator , to finally obtaining the entropy .",
    "it may be easily proved that for two subsystems initially in pure states , after they interact , a relation between the powers of the reduced density matrices may be obtained @xcite    @xmath16    this helps to calculate functions of any of the density matrices , in particular the entropy operator @xmath17 .",
    "we will follow @xcite in order to obtain the field entropy operator .",
    "for this we first need to find @xmath18 , for this purpose we write    @xmath19    where @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the @xmath23 unit density matrix .",
    "the powers of @xmath24 are then given by @xmath25 by splitting the above sum into two sums , one with odd powers of @xmath26 and one with even powers and using @xmath27 with @xmath28 we can write    @xmath29 + \\frac{\\hat{r}}{2\\epsilon}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon\\right)^n-\\left ( \\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon\\right)^n \\right]\\;.\\ ] ]    we can finally write any power of @xmath30 in terms of itself and the unit matrix ( as expected from cayley - hamilton s theorem ( for @xmath23 matrices ) @xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the determinant @xmath33 . note that we have written @xmath34 in terms of @xmath24 and the unity matrix . alternatively one can express @xmath34 in terms of the chebyshev polynomials as    @xmath35,\\ ] ]    where @xmath36&=&||\\hat{\\rho}_a(t)||^{\\frac{n-1}{2}}u_{n-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2||\\hat{\\rho}_a(t)||^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath37&=&||\\hat{\\rho}_a(t)||^{\\frac{n}{2}}t_{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{2||\\hat{\\rho}_a(t)||^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right)\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 and @xmath39 the chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind respectively @xcite .",

    "we now use the expression for @xmath52 in terms of @xmath30 to write the field entropy operator in terms of the atomic density operator @xmath53 by inserting ( [ atent ] ) into ( [ ent - field ] ) we obtain @xmath54 using the expression of the inverse of the atomic density operator in terms of the purity operator , the entropy may be written as @xmath55)\\}\\;. \\label{29}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the field density matrix the field entropy operator is @xmath56 and from ( [ ccss ] ) we can write @xmath57 as @xmath58 the entropy operator for the field is written as @xmath59",
    "we now consider an initial field given by an statistical mixture of coherent states , @xmath60 , and the atom in its excited state .",
    "the quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the probabilities that the quantized field is either in the coherent state with amplitude @xmath63 or @xmath64 , respectively , with @xmath65 .",
    "the evolved density matrix for such initial conditions is    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the so - called parity operator , with the relation @xmath68 .",
    "it is clear that , by tracing over the field basis we obtain the atomic density matrix    @xmath69    and by tracing over the atomic basis we obtain the field density matrix    @xmath70    and from it we can calculate    @xmath71    in order to have an idea of the behaviour of the field entropy we have calculated the purity parameter @xmath72 and the atomic entropy @xmath3 as it is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig2](a ) we have plotted time evolution of the total atomic inversion @xmath76 and the figures [ fig2](b - c ) the @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .    note that they start in zero and continue being zero for a time longer than the collapse time , in the figure for times up to @xmath80 . for such periods of time",
    "we may disregard the second term in each of the rows of equation ( [ 27 ] ) , yielding exactly    @xmath81    equation ( [ 28 ] ) tells us that , for the periods in which @xmath82 we may separate the calculation of the entropy for the field , obtaining terms related only to the state @xmath10 or @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , we can apply the method of section 2 to each of them . before that , let us rewrite a generalization of equation ( [ 28 ] )    @xmath84    and therefore , a function of it may be written as @xmath85 + \\pi f\\left [ p_{-\\alpha}\\left(|c\\rangle\\langle   c|+|s\\rangle\\langle   s|\\right)\\right ] \\pi\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath86 -\\pi \\ln\\left [ \\left(|c\\rangle\\langle   c|+|s\\rangle\\langle   s|\\right)\\right ] \\pi \\\\&-&\\ln p_{\\alpha}-\\ln p_{-\\alpha}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath87 where @xmath88 is given in ( 23 )",
    ". finally we can obtain the entropy by tracing the entropy operator times the density matrix @xmath89 where @xmath90 in figure 3 we plot the entropy as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "it may be noticed in the above equation that the entropy for the entropy for the mixture of coherent states splits into two parts , one given by the entropy of a single coherent states and the other one given just by the mixture probabilities .",
    "this figure should be compared with fig .",
    "1(a ) which has oscillations about the region of @xmath91 reflecting the term we neglected in equation ( 34 ) .     where the field initially was prepared in statistical mixture of coherent states with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and the atom was in its excited state as in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . ]",
    "by noticing that the quantities @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , are zero for relevant periods of time , for such periods we can calculate ,  _ exactly _ the entropy for an initial field composed by a statistical mixture of coherent states .",
    "we could argue that because of the _ cuasi - orthonormality _ of different coherent states with ( large ) different amplitudes it is possible to calculate the entropy in an analytical form , but this is not the case : we are truly relaying on the numerical properties of @xmath92 , i.e. , in the fact that , for large periods of time , these quantities are zero .",
