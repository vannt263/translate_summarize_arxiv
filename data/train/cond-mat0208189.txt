    "the binding energy of two electrons , @xmath164 , is also of the order of the spin gap in the undoped ladder but twice as large as the hole pair binding energy . in our previous investigation of the two - leg cuo ladder  @xcite",

    "we have calculated the pair binding energy as a function of the various model parameters in a ladder with @xmath165 cu sites .",

    "it is easy to measure correlations between doped charges because there are no other itinerant charges ( i.e. , there are no charge fluctuations in the undoped system ) . in the cuo hubbard model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , however , bare electron - electron and hole - hole correlation functions give little information about the correlations between two doped charges because they are dominated by the quantum fluctuations of the other charges .",
    "therefore , we have to project out the ground state of  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) onto a subspace with no charge fluctuation .",
    "for that purpose we consider a perturbation expansion in @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath171 and @xmath126 close to 1 .",

    "we average the density over four o sites around each cu site because a doped hole is locked in a singlet state with another hole on a cu site as in a @xmath189 cluster ( i.e. , in a zhang - rice singlet  @xcite ) .",

    "an examination of the spin structure of the @xmath212 state containing two doped electrons or holes shows that the spin and added carriers are spatially correlated .",
    "thus , the spin gap is set by the energy of a bound magnon - carrier pair .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig13 ] shows the spin density ( on the cu sites ) of the @xmath212 state with two doped carriers ( electrons or holes ) , when these doped carriers are in the configuration with the highest probability @xmath213 ( the pair structure of the triplet states is similar to that of the singlet states shown in fig .",

    "the spin structure shown in fig .  [ fig13 ] is very similar to that found in @xmath19-@xmath167-@xmath20 two - leg ladders .",
    "@xcite for hole doping , however , the spin structure is quite different , which is only in part due to the difference in the carrier configuration .",

    "using the density matrix renormalization group , we have studied the structure of the charge , spin , and pairing correlations for a hubbard - like model of a two - leg cuo ladder .",
    "this model allowed us to examine the differences between electron and hole doping that occur in a charge transfer insulator .",
    "for the undoped ladder , where there is one hole per cu , we found that parameters obtained from lda downfolding calculations  @xcite lead to reasonable charge and spin gaps . a typical parameter set in units of the cu - o hopping @xmath6 were a near - neighbor oxygen - oxygen hopping @xmath31 , an oxygen - copper site energy difference @xmath32 , and on - site cu and o coulomb repulsions @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . with these parameters ,",
    "the charge gap is determined primarily by @xmath25 rather than @xmath11 and the spin gap is set by the effective cu - cu exchange .",
    "we have found that the o - o hopping @xmath7 plays a significant role in giving a large effective cu - cu exchange interaction .    for the undoped ladder , we found that the holes were distributed approximately 70% on the cu sites and 30% on the o sites .",
    "the large on - site coulomb interaction on the cu site leads to the spin moment being dominantly on the cu site .",
    "basically , if the hole is on a cu site , the square of the spin moment ( 0.7 ) has nearly its full value of 3/4 .",
    "when electrons are added , they go primarily onto the cu sites ( of order 80% of the added charge goes onto the cu sites ) .",
    "this is seen in both the decrease in the average cu site hole occupation and the decrease in the average spin moment .",
    "note that the decrease in the spin moment simply reflects the fact that there are fewer cu@xmath216 sites in the electron - doped system .",
    "alternatively , when holes are added ( electrons are removed ) , they go primarily onto the o sites ( of order 20% of the holes go onto the cu with 80% going onto the surrounding o sites ) .",
    "this leaves the local spin moments on the cu sites .",
    "thus , the undoped cuo ladder is a spin - gapped insulator with a charge gap set by the oxygen - copper site energy difference .",
    "magnetically the undoped ladder is essentially a heisenberg ladder made up of hole spins localized on the cu sites .",
    "when the ladder is electron doped , some of the holes ( and spins ) on the cu sites are removed and pairing correlations develop . because the doped electrons go primarily onto the cu sites , the electron - doped system is closer to the one - band hubbard or t - j models .",
    "when the ladder is hole doped , the holes go dominantly onto the o sites leading to a low - density gas of fermions delocalized over the o - site lattice and interacting by spin - exchange with the localized spins on the cu sites .",
    "the local magnetic moments remain essentially unchanged on the cu sites but the o holes frustrate the exchange coupling between the spins on the cu sites .",
    "this local , strong coupling picture focuses on the differences between the electron and hole - doped ladders . nevertheless , on low energy scales , the spin gap and pairing correlations of the electron- and hole - doped systems are quite similar .",
    "both exhibit @xmath0-wave like power law pairing correlations in which the pair field cu - cu rung - leg correlations are negative .",
    "the spin gap for both dopings is associated with a bound magnon - pair .",
