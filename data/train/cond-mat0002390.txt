    "overall photon scattering and emissions from such a system is complicated as internal fields couple to external fields to cause radiative decays of atom - photon polaritons .",
    "their periodic energy exchange implied by @xmath50 could exhibit rabi type oscillations in the radiated fields . if on the other hand when the motional state @xmath60 is initially unpopulated , oscillatory behaviors will not appear since @xmath50 can not contribute during the early stages of dynamic interaction .    in the following two sections",
    ", we will focus on situations when @xmath59 is the dominant interaction term .",
    "we start by outlining the required system conditions to achieve this .",
    "first we observe that @xmath56 governs mostly small angle scattering while both raman type interactions give rise to mostly large angle scattering .",
    "mathematically this is due to the fact that diagonal elements of the franck - condon factors are sharply peaked around axis defined by pump wave vector @xmath17 , while off - diagonal elements favor off - axial scattering for traps of reasonable size @xmath61 a few times the resonant wave length @xmath62 .",
    "the interaction strengths of rayleigh , stokes , and anti - stokes processes all depend on the spatial distribution of atoms , the initial ground state population @xmath63 , and the laser induced effective dipole interaction strength @xmath0 . in general",
    "these different factors compete and complicated pictures of light scattering emerge .",
    "but for the current model system , we find that the major role is played by the geometry factor of the system through @xmath64 , of which several off - diagonal elements are displayed in fig .",
    "since @xmath56 is the leading order interaction term , we will first consider its effect by discussing the process of small angle scattering . in this case , the system dynamics is determined essentially by @xmath65 .",
    "using the property @xmath66 , and taking @xmath67 with @xmath68 real , we obtain the following heisenberg operator equations of motion @xmath69 where we have defined auxiliary quadrature operators @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and the form function operator @xmath72 .",

    "we can readily see that the incoherent part contributes mostly at higher temperatures while the coherent part is more effective at lower temperatures . in order to suppress incoherent large angle scattering",

    "we can now take advantage of trap size parameters . for a cylindrical sample with @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) the long ( short ) axis length as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the coherent scattering is controlled by @xmath95 where @xmath96 axis is chosen to be along the pump field direction and @xmath97 are polar and azmithual angles of the scattering direction .",

    "( [ f00 ] ) , we see that the cigar shaped geometry with @xmath101 is more effective in suppressing the overall coherent rayleigh scattering .    concluding this section we note that under optimal conditions , it is possible to significantly suppress the coherent rayleigh scattering . therefore effects of the other wise higher order raman processes can be made dominant . as reasoned before we can also ignore contributions from anti - stokes terms at sufficient low temperatures and for short pulse excitation .",
    "thus we shall first develop a simple model considering @xmath59 as the only dominant mechanism in describing the directional and exponential superradiance . a more complete treatment including anti - stokes processes will be considered in sec . v using a generalized atomic side mode formalism .",
    "in this section we consider large angle raman scattering processes when small angle rayleigh scattering is suppressed . in the low temperature limit when all atoms are condensed into the ground motional state , we can neglect the ground state atom number fluctuations and approximate @xmath102 as a classical field .",

    "these wavepacket operators are the best compromise one can construct to reflect the momentum conservation law for starting in the ground motional state before the absorption and emission cycle .",

    "( [ eqp ] ) , the right hand side then immediately motivates the introduction of operators @xmath221 , and @xmath94 . upon averaging over their dynamic operator equations , even higher order moments in general",
    "we then follow the decorrelation approximation as outlined above , and only keep factorized products of already introduced operator moments .",
    "more details of this higher order decorrelation approximation can be found in previous treatments of superfluorescence @xcite .",

    "this system of twelve equations can be compared with the maxwell - bloch equations describing superfluorescence from a sample of coherently pumped three level atoms @xcite .",
    "similar to current trapped bec systems , earlier superfluorescence studies also assumed cigar ( or pencil ) shaped gas distribution , albeit with much larger volumes . in those earlier studies , the pump pulse is typically along the long axis direction of the gas sample that is typically about several centimeters long @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis included both propagation retardation and transverse diffractive effects @xcite .",
    "in the recent mit experiment , the sample size is much smaller and the pump pulse is along the transverse direction of the long axis @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at higher pump power super - radiant pulse shapes from the bec display multiple pulses or ringing effects similar to earlier hot gases experiments @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "sequential superradiance may arguably be considered as a temporal analog of spatial effects observed earlier although the mechanism is clearly different .",
    "more recent experiments observed temporal ringing as an intrinsic property in hot gas superfluorescence @xcite . here in the bec superradiance system",

    "are negligible .",
    "the motional ground state - condensate node , is coupled only to the two first order side modes thus no dissipative terms appear in the equation for @xmath63 . in view of the one to one correspondence between the number of atoms in the side modes and their corresponding number of scattered photons",

    "the coherent coupling parameter @xmath0 depends on the pump laser power .",

    "the depletion of condensate atoms is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] for several different choices of @xmath2375.1 , 6.7 , 8.3 , and 10.7 ( hz ) with larger coupling rates correspond to faster decaying curves .",
    "the effect of @xmath227 on the condensate decay can be obtained from a comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , in which only two curves with @xmath241 and 10.7 ( hz ) are displayed .",
    "looking at these two curves , we can identify four separate dynamical regimes .",
    "first , there is the linear regime where the condensate can be considered as undepleted .",
    "second , there is the super - radiant regime where a fast decay of condensate atom number occurs .",
    "the third regime is a transient one where oscillatory behavior is seen .",
    "finally we have the fourth regime where saturation sets in and the condensate decays slowly",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig10 ] show that oscillations are more prominent at smaller decoherence rate and higher pump laser power . in this case , the linear regime is shortened and super - radiant decay becomes faster .",
    "figures [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] display matter wave amplifications for the first and second atomic side modes respectively for the same parameter set as used in fig .",

    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig10 ] respectively .",
    "they are seen to increase sharply but to decay more slowly . at higher laser powers",
    "double peak ( shoulder ) structures are seen while at lower laser powers the pulse shape becomes more asymmetric , broad and has single peak . with lower decoherence rate",
    "the double - peak structure is more prominent , and the pulse becomes more intense and shorter .",
    "additional peaks in the rings are also observed in tail regions .",
    "physically we assign the double - peak structure as due to sequential ( cascading ) super - radiant scattering .",
    "overall we find that the high order decorrelation approximation produces simulation results capable of capturing detailed dynamics of the super - radiant scattering from trapped condensates @xcite .",
    "apart from the unavoidable choice of introducing and adjusting phenomenological coupling constants and various decay and decoherence rates , all reported experimental observations can be interpreted based on our model @xcite .",
    "we also find that @xmath242 and @xmath94 terms are almost negligible in affecting system dynamics , presumably because they are already of a higher order as compared with @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "further research into this point is needed for a complete characterization of quantum states of scattered photons .    for completeness",
    ", we finally discuss solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eqp ] ) using the markov approximation .",
    "we formally integrate the heisenberg operator equation for @xmath210 in terms its initial condition @xmath245 and a radiation reaction term related to emitted field from atoms .",
    "the formal solution is then substituted into atomic operator equations and the standard markov approximation made such that the radiation reaction on atoms become instantaneous .",
    "the resulting langevin equations for atomic operators now contain quantum noise terms @xcite due to @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "averaging over this quantum noise reservoir and taking care of operator ordering , we obtain the following equations for averaged quantities ( again neglecting @xmath222 ) @xmath247-{\\cal l}n_{1},\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{d}{dt}n_0&=&\\gamma_{m}n_1(1+n_2 ) , \\label{eqm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath248 the markovian coupling constant @xmath249 .",
    "it also depends on reservoir noise spectra width as well as a shape factor of the condensate .",
    "the above procedure is similar to what is used in obtaining eqs .",
    "( [ fdot ] ) , ( [ bdot ] ) , ( [ fsmall ] ) , ( [ fl ] ) , and ( [ fav ] ) .",
    "@xmath250 can be estimated from the rayleigh scattering rate @xmath251 to be @xmath252 ( where typically in the mit experimental set up @xcite , @xmath253 ) .",
    "we again will use @xmath254 and the new phenomenological loss rate [ due to scattering into nodes at @xmath255 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ] is chosen to be @xmath256 ( hz ) .",
    "the results for condensate and side mode populations from markovian dynamics eq .",
    "( [ eqm ] ) are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig14]-[fig16 ] .",
    "the four sets of curves are gain respectively for @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , and @xmath260 ( hz ) , with larger @xmath250 values correspond to faster decaying condensates .",
    "we see that the transient regime with oscillations is visibly absent , while previous results from the decorrelation approximation [ eqs .",
    "( [ nm1 ] ) and ( [ nm2 ] ) ] correctly captures this essential experimental feature .",
    "in addition , we find the scattered intensity displays a two pulse structure in the markov approximation , rather than the ringing shoulder structure discussed earlier .",
    "we thus come to the conclusion that a simple markov approximation is incapable of describing dynamic processes of the super - radiant bec system . in the markovian limit",
    ", the dynamical behavior of scattered intensity follows @xmath261 . by incorporating quantum fluctuation and choosing appropriate initial conditions",

    "@xcite presented results from a collection of single - shot simulations .",
    "in summary , we have presented a thorough investigation of the super - radiant light scattering from trapped bose condensates .",
    "we have shown that depending on gas sample conditions : _",
    "e.g. _ density , geometrical shapes , temperatures , and pump field characteristics , the scattered light can exhibit either oscillatory or exponential gain behaviors .",
    "we have presented a new atomic side mode formulation that allows for a useful and simple framework to analyze problems related to scattering from trapped particles in momentum space .",
    "a cascading structure in the side mode lattice is presented that allows for identification of sequential super - radiant pulse dynamics .",
    "our investigations also point to eminent correlations between photons from the two end firing modes similar to the two cascading photons from a single atom @xcite .",
    "interestingly , atomic side modes connected through multiple scattering are highly correlated because of their non - commuting algebra . even though we simplified that aspect of them in accordance with the current experimental designs , future experiments might as well take this as an advantage of generating strongly correlated high flux of photons .",
    "we are currently investigating prospects of a super - radiant source for correlated or entangled photons from our model system .",
    "our study also clarifies similarities and differences of the recent mit super - radiant experiment from trapped atomic bec with earlier studies of hot gas superfluorescence .",
    "we have compared theoretical approaches based a markov approximation with a non - markovian description of the experimental light scattering observation .",
    "we find that the occurrence of multiple peaks in super - radiant pulse reflects the generally non - markovian nature of our system .",
    "our studies also sheds light on the role of dephasing in a coherent quantum system @xcite .",
