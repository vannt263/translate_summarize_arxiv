    "a useful lemma about plugs proved in reference  @xcite is the following :    a flow bordism with an infinite leaf with non - empty entry or exit region is either a plug or a semi - plug .",
    "[ linfleaf ]      the technique of plugs generalizes without any substantive changes to the category of measured foliations , either smooth or pl .",
    "the base @xmath92 of a measured plug is measured , but by moser s theorem , the only relevance of this structure is that a bridge immersion of @xmath92 with large volume into a disk with small volume is inconvenient , although not strictly impossible , if @xmath92 has large volume .",
    "one way to overcome this inconvenience is to rescale the transverse measure of the plug to make the measure of @xmath92 small .",

    "a flow bordism with support @xmath88 is _ attachable _ if the flux form is smooth in a neighborhood @xmath117 of the boundary , so that the foliation method can be used to insert it without loss of smoothness .",
    "a @xmath30-dimensional , measured @xmath10 semi - plug @xmath87 with support @xmath88 can always be made attachable by the following method : since the flux form @xmath7 is defined over all of @xmath88 and @xmath88 bounds @xmath89 , it is the differential of an @xmath124-form @xmath125 in a neighborhood of the boundary @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath126 be an @xmath124-form which is a smooth approximation to @xmath125 in a smaller neighborhood of @xmath89 , agrees with @xmath125 in a neighborhood of @xmath127 , and is an interpolation with a smooth bump function in between .",
    "in addition , choose @xmath126 so that @xmath128 has the same parallel and transverse boundary at @xmath89 as does @xmath7 .",
    "then the flux form which is @xmath128 on @xmath117 and @xmath7 on @xmath127 yields an attachable semi - plug @xmath129 with the same leaf structure as @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , the mirror - image construction applied to @xmath129 yields an attachable plug .",
    "the main construction of the proof of theorem  [ thdiscrete ] is a measured , dehn - twisted plug . before constructing or even defining such a plug",
    ", we recall several facts about dehn twists and dehn surgery : the boundary of a solid torus @xmath130 has a distinguished embedded circle , the _ meridian _ , which is unique up to isotopy and which is identified by the fact that it bounds a disk in the solid torus .",
    "a _ framing _ of a solid torus is a homotopy class of another circle in the boundary ; the framing may or may not equal the meridian .",
    "a framing is _ integral _ if it homologically crosses the meridian exactly once .",
    "dehn surgery _ on a 3-manifold consists of removing a collection of disjoint framed tori and gluing them back in such a way that the new meridian circles match the old framing circles ; the topology of the resulting manifold does not otherwise depend on the gluing maps .",
    "the lickorish - wallace theorem @xcite asserts that every closed , oriented 3-manifold can be obtained from @xmath2 by integral dehn surgery , or equivalently every closed , oriented 3-manifold can be obtained from every other by integral dehn surgery . in the second formulation",
    ", the theorem also holds for non - orientable manifolds .",
    "suppose that @xmath131 is a plug with base @xmath132 whose support @xmath88 is homeomorphic to a solid torus @xmath130 .",
    "recall that there is an attaching map @xmath116 between neighborhoods of the boundary , and note that the thickened base @xmath108 is also a solid torus . if @xmath133 , the curve @xmath134 is a meridian of @xmath135 , while the curve @xmath136 is a convenient standard framing which might be called the _",

    "an integrally dehn - twisted plug @xmath131 , assuming that it exists , can be used to construct a foliation on any closed , oriented 3-manifold with finitely many closed leaves as follows : the 3-torus @xmath143 possesses a smooth , measured foliation @xmath64 such that all leaves are dense : if @xmath143 is given with periodic coordinates @xmath144 , define @xmath64 to be parallel to the vector field @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 are linearly independent over the rationals .",

    "non - orientable manifolds can similarly be handled as follows : a rotation of a round 2-sphere @xmath151 by an irrational angle descends to a volume - preserving , smooth diffeomorphism of the projective plane @xmath152 with only one periodic point , a fixed point .",

    "every other non - orientable , closed 3-manifold can be obtained from this one by appropriate insertions of @xmath131 .",
