    "many extensions of the standard model predict the existence of light scalar particles . the axion may be the most debated one but there are also approximate nambu - goldstone fields associated with family symmetries , or moduli fields , or dilatons , or superpartners of the gravitino  @xcite .",
    "exchange of such particles by ordinary matter will induce forces that extend over the compton wavelength of the particle  @xcite .",
    "however , the effect will be felt by bulk matter only if the potential is spin - independent so that forces can add up coherently over macroscopic distances .",
    "now , a pseudoscalar particle , such as the axion , is coupled to fermions via a @xmath2 which , in the nonrelativistic limit , flips the spin .",
    "therefore , single pseudoscalar exchange leads to spin - dependent forces that do not extend over macroscopic unpolarized bodies  @xcite . a double exchange of pseudoscalars on the other hand can coherently sum over a macroscopic sample of matter because it can leave the spin unflipped .",
    "the explicit form of these forces has been derived and their phenomenological consequences explored in previous work in the context of nonrelativistic `` old fashioned perturbation theory ''  @xcite . here",
    "we reopen the question of pseudoscalar mediated forces in the light of the powerful dispersion theoretical techniques devised by feinberg and sucher and collaborators that make extensive use of full relativistic quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : metode ] we give the necessary theoretical background which is nothing but a brief resum of the seminal work by feinberg and sucher .",
    "section  [ sec : yuk ] is devoted to the yukawa type interaction and section  [ sec : der ] deals with derivatively coupled scalars .",
    "we shall see that the two interactions produce quite different potentials  @xcite , a fact that could not have been derived in a purely non - relativistic framework  @xcite .",
    "the paper ends with a brief summary and conclusions contained in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "following the general strategy devised by feinberg and sucher  @xcite , we define a potential in a given quantum field theory by equating the scattering amplitude for a two body process that follows from the usual feynman rules , with the transition amplitude associated to a schrdinger type equation solved _  la _ lippmann - schwinger .",
    "let us be explicit and consider elastic scattering of particles a and b with four momenta @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the initial state and @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the final state .",
    "the mandelstam variables are then :    @xmath7    with @xmath8 .    in the c.m .",
    "we write the momenta as @xmath9    now @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 , whose physical region is @xmath14 where @xmath15 \\left [ s-{\\left (          m_a - m_b \\right)}^2 \\right ] \\right/ 4 s.\\ ] ]    the transition from initial state @xmath16 to final state @xmath17 is described in quantum field theory by the transition matrix element @xmath18 where @xmath19 are normalization factors of one particle states and @xmath20 is the invariant feynman amplitude .",
    "the definition of our potential follows now from identifying this transition amplitude with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sum of the free dirac hamiltonians for particles a and b. here all quantities are referred to the c.m .    the feynman amplitude @xmath23 is understood as a series expansion in ( even ) powers of the coupling constant associated to single , double ,  particle exchange in the t - channel .",
    "we assume that the potential v also admits a series expansion @xmath24    so we determine v order by order in perturbation theory through @xmath25    here we should point out a technicality .",
    "the potential we are after must have the form  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an operator that projects on the positive energy states of @xmath22 . because @xmath28 and @xmath29 we can rewrite the previous equations that determine the potential as , @xmath30    in principle the above equations permit an iterative determination of the potential to the desired order .",
    "however we are not done yet because we would like to have our potential in position space and what we have is the operator @xmath31 in the momentum representation .",
    "therefore , we should fourier transform our results back to configuration space , i.e. we wish to find @xmath32 such that @xmath33    inversion of the above equation , however , requires knowing the function @xmath23 for all values of three momentum .",
    "but we only know the scattering amplitude on shell , i.e. for @xmath34 .",
    "we can use the fact that @xmath35 is an analytic function of t and so analytically extend its domain beyond the physical region , i.e. for all values of @xmath36 .",
    "suppose @xmath35 is analytic everywhere except for branch cuts on the real axis and furthermore , it vanishes for large @xmath37 .",
    "then , using cauchy s theorem , we can write @xmath38 where @xmath39_t}{2 i}$ ] is the spectral density and @xmath40_t$ ] is the discontinuity of @xmath23 across the cut .",
    "only the piece of the amplitude arising from the right hand cut will be of interest to us for only this piece leads to a long range potential  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the basic relations eqs  ( [ eq : u2 ] )  and  ( [ eq : u4 ] ) hold also in the extended domain , we can fourier invert them as follows . ] , @xmath41    we use now the spectral representation given before to obtain @xmath42 where , to reach this final form , we conveniently changed the order in which integrals were done . in short , obtaining long range potentials amounts to calculating t - channel discontinuities in feynman diagrams and performing a laplace transform .",
    "we shall see how things work out in detail as we do our specific calculations in the next two sections .",
    "our starting point is the lagrangian density , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a fermion field and @xmath45 is the pseudoscalar field which we take to be massless .",
    "the potential associated to single particle exchange is easily obtained from the discontinuity associated to the diagram in fig .",
    "the spectral density function @xmath46 is in this case @xmath47    after laplace transforming we get the relativistic potential operator @xmath48 where subindices make explicit that dirac matrices act either on spinor a or spinor b.    the nonrelativistic limit of equation above leads to the well known spin - dependent potential    @xmath49    with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the masses of particles a and b respectively .",
    "what we are really interested in is @xmath52 , i.e. the potential due to two - particle exchange . to this end",
    "we need the discontinuities of diagrams in fig . 2 and the discontinuity of the subtraction term in eq  ( [ eq : u4 ] ) ( iteration of the lowest order potential @xmath53 ) .    the feynman amplitude associated to fig .",
