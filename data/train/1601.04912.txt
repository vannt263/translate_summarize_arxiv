    "we consider a thin elastic anisotropic plate @xmath6 of the relative thickness @xmath7 with one or several small , of diameter @xmath8 support areas at its lower base @xmath9 ( see figure [ f1],a ) . in this paper",
    "we assume that the plate is clamped along the lateral side @xmath10 while the bases @xmath11 are traction - free , except at the only small support zone@xmath12 here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are domains in the plane @xmath15 with smooth boundaries and compact closures ( see figure [ f1],b ) , the @xmath16-coordinate origin @xmath17 is put inside @xmath14 , @xmath18        this paper is a direct sequel of @xcite where a convenient form of korn s inequality in @xmath19 was derived as well as a boundary layer effect near @xmath0 was investigated scrupulously .",
    "these results , combined with the classical procedure of dimension reduction , see @xcite etc . , and an asymptotic analysis of singular perturbation of boundaries , see @xcite , allow us here to construct and justify asymptotic expansions of elastic fields in @xmath20 i.e. , displacements , strains and stresses",
    ".    a small dirichlet perturbation of boundary conditions may lead to neglectable changes in a solution but in our case , unfortunately , such a change is fair and significant in two aspects .",
    "first of all , fixing the plate ( [ b1.1 ] ) with the sharp supports at @xmath21 cf .",
    "( [ b1.3 ] ) , results in the sobolev point conditions , see , e.g. , @xcite , namely the average deflexion @xmath22 vanishes at the points @xmath23 the centers of the small support areas . due to the sobolev embedding theorem in @xmath15",
    "these additional restrictions are natural in the variational formulation of the traditional two - dimensional model of kirchhoff s plate while the only implication defect turns into a certain lack of smoothness properties of the solution at the points @xmath24 much more disagreeable input of the small support areas becomes a crucial reduction of the convergence rate : instead of the the conventional rate @xmath25 for the kirchhoff model , we detect @xmath26 cf .",
    "@xcite , that is unacceptable for any application purpose .",
    "the three - dimensional boundary layers , described and investigated in @xcite , see also @xcite , help to construct specific corerctions in the vicinity of @xmath27 to take into account their influence on the far - field asymptotics and , as a result , to achieve the appropriate error estimate @xmath28 at the same time , the global asymptotic approximation of the elastic fields becomes quite complicated so that its utility in application is rather doubtful . in this way ,",
    "it is worth to restrict our analysis to the fair - field asymptotics whose dependence on the small parameter @xmath29 remains complicated but can be expressed through rational functions in @xmath30 and an integral characteristics of the support area , namely a @xmath31-matrix of elastic capacity @xcite .    to provide a correct and mathematically rigorous two - dimensional model of the supported plate ,",
    "we employ two approaches .",
    "first , we turn to the technique of self - adjoint extensions of differential operators ( see the pioneering paper @xcite , the review @xcite and , e.g. , the papers @xcite , especially @xcite connecting this approach with the method of matched asymptotic expansions ) . to simulate the influence of localized special boundary layer , we provide a proper choice of singular solutions by selecting a special self - adjoint extension in the lebesgue space @xmath32 of the matrix @xmath33 of differential operators in the kirchhoff plate model , see ( [ 3.28 ] ) , ( [ 3.27 ] ) .",
    "parameters of this extension depend on the quantity @xmath34 and the elastic logarithmic capacity matrix , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2 ) , which is similar to the logarithmic capacity in harmonic analysis , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the introduced model is two - fold and can be formulated as either an abstract equation with the obtained self - adjoint operator , or a problem on a stationary point of the natural energy functional in a weighted function space with detached asymptotics .",
    "advantages and deficiencies of these approaches are discussed in section [ sect4 ] . in any case",
    "the compelled removal of a major part of the three - dimensional layer from the asymptotic form surely reduces capabilities of the model which , in particular , does not give the global approximation of stresses and strains , but does outside a neighborhood of the sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 where the dirichlet conditions are imposed .",
    "thereupon , we mention that , first , the kirchhoff model itself does not approximate correctly stresses and strains near the clamped edge , too , and , second , quite many applications demand to determine asymptotics of displacements only . in corollaries [ cor5.99 ] and [ cor5.77 ] we will give some error estimates for the model , in particular , an asymptotic formula for the elastic energy of the three - dimensional thin - plate",
