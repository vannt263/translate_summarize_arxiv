    "in the iron pnictides , unconventional superconductivity appears in close proximity to a magnetic instability @xcite . as a result ,",
    "much of the research into these compounds has been devoted to understanding the magnetic properties of these systems @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the spin - density wave ( sdw ) magnetic order of most iron pnictides has orthorhombic ( @xmath0 ) symmetry and corresponds to stripes of parallel spins modulated either along the @xmath1 direction ( i.e. ordering vector @xmath2 and staggered magnetic order parameter @xmath3 ) or along the @xmath4 direction ( i.e. ordering vector @xmath5 and staggered magnetic order parameter @xmath6 ) , in the coordinate system of the fe square lattice @xcite . theoretically , this state has been described by a variety of approaches , from purely localized heisenberg spins @xcite to itinerant nesting - based scenarios @xcite to hybrid models mixing local moments and itinerant carriers @xcite .",
    "common to nearly all these approaches is the assumption that the magnetic degrees of freedom have an underlying @xmath7 spin - rotational symmetry . from a phenomenological perspective",
    ", this implies that the magnetic free energy @xmath8 depends only on the absolute value of the magnetic order parameters , i.e. @xmath9 @xcite .    despite the success of these approaches in describing many magnetic properties of the iron pnictides  such as the onset of a preemptive nematic transition @xcite and the appearance of a tetragonal magnetic ground state @xcite  there are important features that remain largely unaddressed .",
    "in particular , the @xmath7 rotational symmetry of a free spin does not hold for a magnetic moment in a crystal . instead",
    ", the symmetries of the underlying lattice induce anisotropies in spin space that may be significant @xcite .",
    "indeed , in most iron pnictides , the magnetic moments are observed to point parallel to the modulation vector of the stripes , i.e. @xmath10 @xcite . attesting the significance of this spin anisotropy",
    ", a sizable spin gap of the order of @xmath11 mev is also found at low temperatures deep in the magnetically ordered state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent experiments in hole - doped iron pnictides have reported a spin reorientation near optimal doping , in which the direction of the magnetic moments flip from in - plane to out - of - plane @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this spin reorientation takes place in a region of the phase diagram in which the magnetic ground state changes from stripe / orthorhombic to tetragonal .",
    "therefore , elucidating the origins of these spin anisotropies and their impact on the normal state properties is paramount to advance our understanding of the iron pnictides . a natural candidate to account for these effects",
    "is the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) term @xmath12 @xcite , which converts the lattice anisotropies into anisotropies in spin space .",
    "recent arpes measurements of the soc @xmath13 have reported values of the order of @xmath14 mev @xcite , which is not far from the typical magnetic energy scale of the problem ( as extracted for instance from optical conductivity measurements @xcite ) . to include the soc term in theoretical models",
    ", it is necessary to account for the puckering of the as atoms along the feas plane , which effectively doubles the unit cell of the fe - only square lattice . in this paper , instead of working with the cumbersome ten - band model relevant for the 2-fe unit cell , we consider a simpler low - energy microscopic model that respects all the symmetries of the feas plane and focuses only on the states near the fermi level .",
    "such a model , which relies on the smallness of the fermi surface pockets of the iron pnictides , was previously derived by cvetkovic and vafek using rigorous group theoretical arguments @xcite . here",
    ", we show how the main ingredients of the model can be derived from a straightforward expansion of the usual five - orbital model for the pnictides . by computing microscopically the magnetic free energy in the paramagnetic state , we find the leading - order magnetic anisotropic terms : @xmath15    the anisotropic coefficients @xmath16 are proportional not only to the square of the soc term , @xmath17 , but also to the hund s rule coupling @xmath18 .",
    "evaluation of the coefficients reveals that @xmath19 for most of the temperature - doping phase diagram , implying that the magnetic moments have a general tendency to lie in the plane .",
    "interestingly , in the hole - doped side of the phase diagram , we find a small region in which @xmath20 , indicating a spin reorientation from in - plane to out - of - plane .",
    "both results are in qualitative agreement with the observations discussed above , providing evidence that the soc term , with the aid of the hund s rule coupling , is sufficient to account for the magnetic anisotropies of the iron pnictides .",
    "this conclusion contrasts with previous proposals that orbital and/or nematic order are necessary to explain the observed magnetic moment orientation @xcite .    for completeness",
    ", we also analyze the nature of the magnetic ground state across the phase diagram .",
    "we find a general tendency of electron - doped compounds to form an orthorhombic uniaxial ( single-@xmath21 ) stripe state ( i.e. either @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) , whereas hole - doped compounds favor a tetragonal biaxial ( double-@xmath21 ) magnetic state ( i.e. @xmath24 ) .",
    "such an electron - hole asymmetry is also qualitatively consistent with experiments  and in particular with the recent observation that the spin reorientation takes place in a region of the phase diagram in which the magnetic ground state is tetragonal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the low - energy microscopic model with the soc term and the electronic interactions .",
    "section [ sec : second_order_free_energy ] is devoted to the analysis of the coefficients of the free energy responsible for the magnetic anisotropy within leading - order . in section [ sec : c2vsc4 ] we refine the phase diagram by including fourth order contributions to the free energy that allow us to distinguish between stripe and tetragonal magnetic ground states .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "details of the calculations are included in four appendices .",
    "we start with a low - energy microscopic model that focuses only on the electronic states near the fermi level , while respecting the symmetries of the feas plane .",
    "such a model was originally derived in ref .",
    "@xcite using the symmetry properties of the non - symmorphic space group @xmath25 of a single feas plane . here",
    ", we present an alternative derivation based on the typical 5-orbital tight - binding model used for the iron pnictides @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the momentum , @xmath28 is the spin , and @xmath29 denote one of the five fe orbitals , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the matrix @xmath35 corresponds to the fourier - transformed tight - binding dispersions involving up to fourth - nearest neighbor hoppings .",
    "its explicit expression is given in appendix a. note that this hamiltonian is based on the single - fe square lattice ( i.e. it refers to the `` unfolded '' brillouin zone ) , and that the coordinate system is defined such that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are parallel to the nearest - neighbor fe atoms directions .",
    "the actual crystallographic unit cell contains two fe atoms due to the puckering of the as atoms , resulting in the so - called `` folded '' brillouin zone , described by the coordinates @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : unit_cells ] ) .",
    "note that the two coordinate systems are related by : @xmath39 where the momentum in the unfolded zone is measured in units of its inverse lattice constant @xmath40 , whereas the momentum in the folded zone is measured in units of the its inverse lattice constant @xmath41 .",
    "the key properties that allow us to derive a simpler low - energy model are the facts that the fermi surface pockets are small and that the orbitals that mostly contribute to the fermi surface are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , the idea is to start at the high - symmetry points of the unfolded brillouin zone ( namely , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) , where the band states are pure orbital states , and perform an expansion of the corresponding matrix elements @xmath35 for small momentum .",
    "note that , to focus on a general and analytically tractable model , we follow ref . @xcite and ignore the states near the @xmath45 point of the unfolded brillouin zone . while it is true that some iron pnictides display a hole - pocket with @xmath33-orbital character centered at this point , this pocket is not usually present for all values of @xmath46 , and is absent in many of the iron - based materials with a single feas plane per unit cell .",
    "correspondingly we consider in this work the doping range in which this pocket lies below the fermi level .",
    "consider first the @xmath47 point ; the two states closest to the fermi level are the @xmath30 and @xmath31 orbitals , which form a degenerate doublet in the absence of soc .",
    "thus , for small @xmath27 , we define the spinor : @xmath48    projecting @xmath35 on this sub - space and expanding for small @xmath27 then yields the @xmath49 hamiltonian : @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a pauli matrix acting on spin space .",
    "the coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 can be obtained directly from the tight - binding parameters ( see appendix a ) .",
    "note , however , that as we move away from the high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone , other orbitals start to contribute to the electronic states .",
    "consequently , the coefficients of the expansion ( as derived in appendix [ app : heurestic_model ] ) will be slightly renormalized by the hybridization with the orbitals not included in the expansion , although the form of the expansion remains invariant . to account for this issue",
    ", we can consider the coefficients to be free parameters that can be fit directly to the first - principle band dispersions .    near the @xmath57 point , the low - energy states correspond to the orbitals @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",

    "interestingly , in the first three compounds , neutron scattering has shown that the onset of a tetragonal magnetic state takes place in a region in which the magnetic moments reorient from in - plane to out - of - plane . within our analysis ,",
    "this can be attributed to the robust region in parameter space in which @xmath112 is the smallest anisotropic coefficient ( see fig . [",
    "fig : phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "more importantly , this anisotropic coefficient removes the degeneracy between the two types of tetragonal sdw phase  the svc and the csdw states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetic_orders_c4 ] )  by favoring the latter .",
    "this is expected to happen even if @xmath191 , since the latter is a quartic coefficient , whereas @xmath112 is a quadratic coefficient .",
    "therefore , at least near the onset of the magnetic transition , it is the soc and the hund s rule coupling that select the csdw phase .",
    "recently , mssbauer @xcite and @xmath74sr @xcite experiments in sr@xmath189na@xmath190fe@xmath168as@xmath168 and ba@xmath189k@xmath190fe@xmath168as@xmath168 , respectively , have reported direct evidence that indeed the csdw state is realized in the regime where the spin is reoriented and the magnetic long - range order preserves tetragonal symmetry .",
    "in summary , we have shown that within a low - energy model that respects the symmetries of the feas plane , magnetic anisotropy arises naturally from the combination of the spin - orbit coupling and the hund s rule coupling .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy consists of three terms ( see sec . [",
    "sec : second_order_free_energy ] ) .",
    "although it can not be mapped generally on an easy - axis or an easy - plane term , it effectively behaves as an easy - plane term for a large part of the parameter region studied here , since @xmath162 .",
    "we found that , for most of the temperature - doping phase diagram , the spin anisotropy is such that the magnetic moments point in - plane and parallel to the direction of the ordering vector .",
    "for a small doping range in the hole - doped side , across all temperatures studied , the magnetic moments tend to reorient and point out - of - plane .",
    "these features are consistent with those observed experimentally , including the spin reorientation observed in the hole - doped pnictides ba@xmath189na@xmath190fe@xmath168as@xmath168 @xcite , sr@xmath189na@xmath190fe@xmath168as@xmath168 @xcite , ba@xmath189k@xmath190fe@xmath168as@xmath168 @xcite .",
    "we also found a general tendency of tetragonal double-*q * magnetic order for the hole - doped side of the phase diagram , whereas the orthorhombic single-*q * stripe magnetic order is favored in the electron - doped side . although this is in general agreement with the experimental observations in ba@xmath189na@xmath190fe@xmath168as@xmath168 @xcite , sr@xmath189na@xmath190fe@xmath168as@xmath168 @xcite , ba@xmath189k@xmath190fe@xmath168as@xmath168 @xcite , and ba(fe@xmath189mn@xmath190)@xmath168as@xmath168 @xcite , our results seem to overestimate the size of the region in which the tetragonal magnetic state is stable .",
    "a possible reason for this discrepancy is that our model does not account for other factors that usually favor the stripe over the tetragonal magnetic state , such as the magneto - elastic coupling @xcite and the residual interactions not directly responsible for the sdw instability @xcite .",
    "yet , our results provide a clear connection between the spin reorientation and the type of tetragonal magnetic state observed in the hole - doped iron pnictides  namely , the charge - spin density - wave state with a non - uniform magnetization @xcite .    an important consequence of our results is that the spin anisotropy is not necessarily tied to the orbital order that is triggered across the nematic / structural transition @xcite .",
    "although it is plausible that such an orbital order affects the spin anisotropy , the latter exists already in the tetragonal paramagnetic state as a result of the symmetry properties of the feas plane . in this regard , it would be interesting to investigate how the spin anisotropies in the tetragonal - paramagnetic phase studied here are connected to the spin anisotropies in the low - temperature phase , after both magnetic and nematic orders are well established .",
    "finally , our results open the important question of how this particular form of magnetic anisotropy impacts the normal state properties of the iron pnictides .",
    "in particular , the onset temperatures and the characters of the coupled nematic - magnetic transitions are expected to be strongly affected by any form of spin anisotropy @xcite .",
