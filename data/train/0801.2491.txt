    "systems where particles may react , change chemical or physical nature and ultimately disappear , model a rich variety of phenomena and provide prominent situations to develop and test the foundations of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when reactions are controlled ballistically , the system can be modeled by an assembly of hard spheres or disks which annihilate with probability @xmath0 or collide elastically with probability @xmath1 everytime two particles meet each other @xcite . within the framework of this probabilistic ballistic annihilation ( pba ) model ,",
    "most of the work carried out up to now has focused on the kinetic equations for the one - body distribution function and the information following from them @xcite . in particular , the hydrodynamic equations , with explicit expressions for the transport coefficients , have been derived by using a generalization of the chapman - enskog expansion @xcite .",
    "our companion paper @xcite , where we have established the hydrodynamic description in the context of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the linearized boltzmann collision operator , falls in this vein . within this formalism",
    ", the conditions in which the hydrodynamic description is expected to apply are somehow more transparent , and can be expressed in terms of some properties of the linearized boltzmann collision operator .    in the present paper ,",
    "the goal is to go beyond the study of one body quantities : the focus is on fluctuations and correlations . to this end",
    ", we use the tools and ideas developed in the context of the linearized boltzmann equation .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the correlations in the dilute limit can indeed be obtained in terms of the linearized boltzmann collision operator .",
    "the study of correlations in the pba model allows to go beyond the description at the level of average values , and to characterize how global magnitudes ( such as the total number of particles or the total energy ) fluctuate around their average .",
    "it has already been shown in other classes of dissipative systems , such as in granular systems , how the knowledge of fluctuations is relevant in order to understand the behavior of the system when vortices or clusters develop @xcite , or even in simpler situations where the system is still homogeneous @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to formulate a theory of fluctuations for the pba model in the dilute limit and to apply it to one of the simplest possible state , namely the homogeneous decay state , exploiting its scaling properties .",
    "this will allow us to obtain explicit expressions for the distributions characterizing the velocity correlations in the system , and to compute the statistics of the total number of particles , total momentum and total energy , which decrease monotonically due to the annihilation process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec .",

    "the system we consider consists of a dilute gas of identical smooth hard spheres or disks of mass @xmath2 and diameter @xmath3 , moving ballistically in dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the particles are supposed to undergo only binary collisions .",
    "when two particles collide they annihilate with probability @xmath0 or collide elastically with probability @xmath1 . in this probabilistic ballistic annihilation ( pba )",
    ", there is therefore no conserved quantity ( except for @xmath5 ) and the number of particles decreases steadily . in this section",
    ", we will show how to obtain evolution equations for the correlation functions in this system .",
    "the general idea of the method is to derive a closed set of equations for the distribution functions describing the fluctuations by using the same kind of approximations as needed to derive the kinetic equation , in our case the boltzmann equation . in this way",
    ", a unified formalism provides the usual kinetic equation as well as evolution equations for the one - time and two - time correlations .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the position and velocity of particle @xmath7 in the system at time @xmath8 .",
    "both , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are parametric functions of the initial positions and velocities of all particles .",

    ".    the initial state of the system is characterized by a point in phase space , @xmath13 , which is chosen at random according to a probability @xmath14 . introducing the notation @xmath15 for the average over the initial conditions , the averages of the microscopic densities @xmath16 over @xmath14 are the usual one - time reduced distribution functions @xmath17 similarly",
    ", two - time reduced distribution functions can also be defined in terms of the microscopic densities as @xmath18 for simplicity we will consider @xmath19 in the following .",
    "we now introduce the two - particle correlation functions through the usual cluster expansion .",

    "the equations for the correlation functions @xmath21 and @xmath20 contain a part corresponding to free streaming and another one which corresponds to collisions .",
    "in particular , the evolution of the one - time correlation function @xmath20 due to collisions has two parts : one due to collisions of particle @xmath50 or @xmath51 ( corresponding to the indices of the correlation function ) with a third particle , which is governed by the boltzmann collision operator ; and a second one , due to collisions of particle @xmath50 with particle @xmath51 , which can be written in terms of the one particle distribution function as a consequence of the molecular chaos hypothesis .",
    "in fact , as in the case of the inelastic granular gas @xcite , the only difference between the evolution equations of the correlation functions for the pba and for a system of elastic particles lies in the substitution of the elastic binary collision operator by the operator for the pba model , @xmath52 .",
    "however this does not give any a priori guarantee on the range of validity of these equations .",

    "as recalled in the previous companion paper @xcite , the boltzmann equation for the pba model ( [ ii1 ] ) admits a particular solution @xmath53 describing a spatially homogeneous decay state ( hds ) , in which all the time dependence is contained in the evolution of the density @xmath54 and the temperature @xmath55 , which are defined as in standard kinetic theory as @xmath56 although there exists no rigorous proof of its stability nor of the fact that such a state should be approached from arbitrary initial conditions , numerical results obtained by molecular dynamic simulations and by the direct monte carlo method strongly support the existence of such a homogeneous solution @xcite . in this section , we review for completeness the evolution equation of the one - particle distribution function and obtain the equations for adequately rescaled correlation functions .",
