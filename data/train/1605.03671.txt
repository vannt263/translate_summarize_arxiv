    "dynamic wetting processes such as spreading , imbibition , and drainage are ubiquitous in natural , agricultural , and industrial processes that are crucial to modern technology .",
    "engineering applications ranging from oil recovery and water treatment to microfluidics and bioanalytical systems have been enabled by a fundamental understanding of wetting that is embodied in mathematical descriptions such as the young - dupre , young - laplace , and lucas - washburn equations @xcite .",
    "these classical wetting models are derived in the framework of continuum thermodynamics under the assumption of perfectly smooth and homogeneous surfaces and predict dynamic behaviors that are governed by deterministic forces due to capillary action and hydrodynamic effects .",
    "although these assumptions can reasonably describe wetting phenomena in macroscale systems , random thermal fluctuations and the microscopic details of the surface must be properly considered to understand interfacial transport processes at micro- and nanoscales . with the advent of micro- and nanofabrication techniques a comprehensive understanding of dynamic wetting",
    "has become essential to improve traditional industrial processes such as surface coating and spraying and to fully exploit the potential of modern fabrication techniques such as micro / nanolitography and additive manufacturing ( or 3d printing ) . as the system dimensions shrink to micrometer scales and below , roughness and chemical heterogeneities inherent to natural and artificial surfaces pose a major challenge in modeling wetting processes @xcite . given the multiscale nature of the microscopic structure of solid surfaces it is not always feasible to define a single characteristic dimension .",
    "nevertheless , surface roughness and heterogeneities are usually characterized by a `` defect '' size @xmath1 , determined by some relevant dimension given by the root - mean - square ( rms ) roughness , height autocorrelation length , or other topographic parameters . for `` macroscopic '' defect sizes @xmath2  nm ,",
    "thermal fluctuations can be neglected and for low capillary numbers the dominant forces are due to elastic deformation of the interface and pinning at localized defects @xcite .",
    "these elastic and pinning forces are merely the consequence of changes in interfacial energies as the contact line moves over random surface heterogeneities of physical and/or chemical nature .",
    "when multiple `` macroscopic '' defects collectively distort and pin the contact line , the energy barriers preventing net displacement give rise to contact angle hysteresis @xcite . the conventional approach to consider the effects of random surface defects with macroscopic ( @xmath2  nm ) or mesoscopic ( @xmath3  10100  nm ) dimensions consists in employing receding and advancing contact angles that are different from the young contact angle @xmath4 , which is determined by minimization of energy on a perfectly smooth surface . despite available predictive models based on the wenzel @xcite and cassie - baxter @xcite equations ,",
    "no analytical approach has been established to quantitatively predict the degree of contact angle hysteresis from topographic parameters characterizing the surface @xcite . as result , receding and advancing contact angles for static and dynamic conditions for different surfaces and liquid pairs must often be determined empirically .",
    "it is necessary to model the effects of random thermal motion when surface defects have dimensions smaller than 100 nm and become comparable to the nanoscale thermal fluctuations of the liquid interface .",
    "the interplay between thermal motion and nanoscale surface features can lead to nontrivial wetting processes that are induced by thermal fluctuations of the contact line @xcite .",
    "a few different approaches have been proposed to model the effect thermal motion and nanoscale surface defects @xmath5  nm have on the dynamics of wetting .",
    "in the so - called molecular kinetic theory ( mkt ) proposed by blake and coworkers @xcite , the effect of atomistic and nanoscale surface defects is modeled as a frictional force that dissipates the work required for the molecules in the contact line to `` hop '' over energy barriers @xmath6 between adsorption sites separated by a distance @xmath7 .",
    "the virtual frictional force proposed in mkt scales linearly with viscosity and its magnitude is often comparable to hydrodynamic forces , which can make it difficult to distinguish between damping due to pinning at nanoscale defects or hydrodynamic effects @xcite .",
    "energy barriers @xmath8 in mkt are determined by the `` work of adhesion '' @xmath9 at localized sites , here @xmath10 is the liquid - vapor surface tension @xmath10 and @xmath11 the area of the adsorption site .",
    "predictions from mkt show agreement with experimentally observed displacement rates for different liquid pairs by assuming nanoscale defect sizes @xmath12  0.21  nm ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for consistency with the model assumptions of mkt",
    "the defect size must be smaller than 1 nm ( @xmath13  nm@xmath14 ) , which yields energy barriers @xmath15 ( here @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath17 the system temperature ) .",
    "notably , a series of recent experimental studies on diverse systems indicate that even larger defect sizes of the order of 10 nm can induce wetting processes that are thermally activated .",
    "for example , experimental observations report that single colloidal particles at water - oil interfaces exhibit surprisingly slow adsorption rates with time scales to reach equilibrium conditions on the order of several hours or even days @xcite . according to conventional wetting models for",
    "perfectly spherical particles @xcite , the adsorption dynamics of single particles is a fast monotonic decay to stable equilibrium conditions where the system energy is a global minimum .",
    "the slow adsorption rates observed for diverse microparticles were attributed to thermally activated processes induced by surface defects with sizes ranging from 1 to 5 nm @xcite .",
    "studies of the spreading dynamics of low viscosity liquids on surfaces with defect sizes of 10 nm report that the contact line displacement is governed by thermally activated processes @xcite .",
    "these studies @xcite indicate that energy barriers prescribing the displacement rate of the contact line are significantly smaller than the work of adhesion , and thus energy barriers @xmath18 induced by mesoscopic defects are smaller than predicted from the defect size .",
    "the `` kinetics '' of contact line displacement on surfaces with mesoscopic defects @xmath19  1100 nm can be described by wetting models based on kramers theory of thermally activated transitions @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the energy barrier @xmath6 and separation distance @xmath20 between long - lived metastable states can have a nontrivial relation with the defect size @xmath1 since these quantities are determined by projecting the multidimensional energy landscape parametrized by molecular positions and velocities onto a one - dimensional energy profile along the `` reaction '' coordinate describing the contact line displacement @xcite .",
    "theoretical models recently proposed by colosqui _",
    "@xcite support the idea that kinetic rates determined via kramers theory @xcite can predict the displacement rates of contact lines in the presence of mesoscopic defects ( @xmath12  110  nm ) .",
    "according to these models @xcite it is possible to observe both a fast dynamic regime , governed by capillary forces and hydrodynamic friction , or a much slower kinetic regime governed by thermally activated processes .",
    "the distance from equilibrium at which the regime crossover takes place is determined by the energy barrier magnitude and defect size , as well as the length of the contact line perimeter @xcite .",
    "previous studies by wexler _",
    "_ @xcite have reported the shear - driven drainage of oil - infused microgrooves and identified conditions where a finite volume of oil is retained for indefinitely long time .",
    "the observed steady states were analytically predicted by establishing a balance between capillary forces and the applied shear stress @xcite .",
    "the drainage dynamics far from equilibrium was approximately described by a lucas - washburn - type equation where thermal motion is neglected and the microgroove surfaces are assumed to be macroscopically smooth but having a receding contact angle significantly different from the young contact angle . given that the drainage of the microgrooves involves the displacement of a contact line perimeter of microscale dimensions , similar phenomena observed in the adsorption of microparticles at water - oil interfaces @xcite is expected to affect the drainage dynamics . indeed , experimental observations by wexler _",
    "show that the drainage dynamics close to steady - state conditions presents deviations from analytical predictions from the proposed lucas - washburn - type equation @xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend the lucas - washburn - type equation for shear - driven drainage in order to consider thermal motion and the presence of nanoscale surface roughness , by following the approach proposed by colosqui _",

    "atomic force microscopy ( afm ) is employed to characterize the surface roughness and thus determine the defect dimensions used in the proposed wetting model for thermally activated wetting .",
    "while the rms roughness seems to determine the magnitude of the energy barriers @xmath6 , the height autocorrelation length appears to determine the separation distance @xmath20 between metastable states .",
    "the proposed model employing mesoscopic defect sizes ( 330  nm ) determined via afm describes the drainage dynamics observed close to equilibrium conditions for different oil viscosities and applied shear rates .",
    "the agreement between the observed contact line displacements and analytical predictions indicate that the drainage close to equilibrium is dominated by thermally activated transitions between metastable states .",
    "moreover , we propose a criterion for estimating the crossover point where the drainage transitions from dynamics governed by capillary and hydrodynamic forces to a kinetic regime dominated by thermally activated processes .",
