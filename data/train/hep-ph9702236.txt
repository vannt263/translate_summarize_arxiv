    "current hera experiments , both in the collider and fixed target modes , allow to take a fresh look at the target fragmentation region in a wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "it has been discussed for a long time within the framework of the parton model that at large @xmath0 properties of the target fragmentation region should depend on @xmath0 , see e.g. ref . @xcite . on the contrary for small @xmath0",
    "the yang limiting fragmentation is expected i.e. the baryon differential multiplicities should be similar to those in soft hadron - nucleon interactions . really within",
    "the parton model hadron radiation is a random process where transverse size of initial configuration diffuses to the transverse size of the target and memory on the hard physics in the hadron final states is restricted by the photon fragmentation region which form small part of rapidity space at fixed @xmath1 when @xmath2 .",
    "this diffusion is especially enhanced in pqcd as a result of infrared slavery , i.e. , from the infrared pole in the invariant charge . as a result of this diffusion , the interaction with the target is always given by non - perturbative qcd , and it is independent of the projectile . at the same time",
    ", it is expected that with increase of @xmath0 the spectrum of baryons should drop faster at large @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the feynman-@xmath0 of the produced baryon , see eq .",
    "( [ zdef ] ) below .",
    "we reevaluate these expectations by taking into account effects of the gluon bremsstrahlung and consider also new opportunities for testing the small @xmath0 dynamics of the strong interaction by means of studies of long range correlations in rapidity space in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "this is now practical with hera s large acceptance detectors .",
    "in particular , we will argue that the lack of correlations between hadron production in the current and target fragmentation regions , which is characteristic for the dglap evolution equations , may break down if non - linear effects are really important in the evolution .",
    "these non - linearities could be observed simply by switching from inclusive measurements to semi - inclusive studies involving the production of hadrons at central rapidities .",
    "first , let us summarize the parton model expectations . it is convenient to consider the scattering in the breit frame , where the colliding proton and the virtual photon have four - momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "after the violent collision , the photon removes a parton with momentum @xmath6 and `` turns it around '' , while the spectator system of partons with momentum @xmath7 fragments into hadrons in the proton fragmentation region .",
    "it is convenient to define the feynman-@xmath0 for the produced baryon , @xmath8 as well as the light - cone fraction @xmath9 of the initial proton momentum carried by this baryon , @xmath10    correlations between hadrons produced in the soft interactions are short - range in rapidity , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , one expects that in the limit of small @xmath0 , when the distance in rapidity between the removed parton carrying the light - cone fraction @xmath0 and the leading partons , which form the leading hadron exceeds several units correlations should disappear .",
    "suppose the leading hadron carries a light - cone fraction of the residual system s momentum of feynman-@xmath3 .",
    "then , the hadron yield , @xmath12 should be independent of @xmath0 , and be the same as for real photon or hadron projectiles .",
    "this is just an analog of yang limiting fragmentation observed in hadron - hadron collisions . in the limit of @xmath13 ,",
    "this relation follows from triple regge analysis @xcite . here",
    ", the same triple reggeon diagrams enter in the inclusive cross section for different projectiles .",
    "the only difference arises from the coupling of the pomeron to the projectile , which cancels out in the ratio to the total cross section for @xmath14 scattering , and hence it is canceled also in the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) and @xmath15 , requires special treatment , see review in ref .",
    "] .    the violation of limiting fragmentation may occur due to screening effects ( multi - pomeron exchanges ) , which are naturally much smaller in the case of @xmath16 or @xmath17 projectiles than for nucleon projectiles .",
    "these effects would lead to a certain enhancement of the spectra of the leading particles for the case of projectiles interacting with a smaller cross section , and to a violation of limiting fragmentation at super - high energies due to an increase of the effective cross section of projectile - nucleon interaction .",
    "indication of such a break - down of factorization for proton production in the triple pomeron limit was observed at the tevatron collider , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .    with increasing @xmath0 , the factorization relation in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) is expected to break down .",
    "first , the triple pomeron piece disappears , i.e. , the ladder becomes too short in rapidity to build the @xmath18 behavior .",
    "next , at @xmath19 the main contribution to dis starts to originate from the scattering off the target s valence quarks .",
    "but the qcd counting rules indicate @xcite that , in this limit , @xmath20 at sufficiently large @xmath0 ( probably @xmath21 ) , dis selects scattering from the minimal fock space configuration @xmath22 .",
    "the analysis of the leading perturbative qcd diagrams , which give the dominant contribution in the @xmath23 limit , indicates that the main contribution stems from configurations where two spectator quarks carry large relative momenta , i.e. , @xmath24 or @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the light - cone fractions of the spectator quarks ( @xmath28 ) @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the independent fragmentation of two spectator quarks becomes more and more important . also , for joint fragmentation of both quarks , the relative chance of producing an excited baryon state increases .",
    "hence , in the limit of large @xmath0 , we expect a graduate decrease of @xmath29 at large @xmath3 and an increase of the yield of excited baryon states @xcite .",
    "for inclusive processes , the major modification to the target fragmentation is due to qcd radiation in the initial state .",
    "really , according to the qcd evolution at large @xmath1 , if the @xmath17 interacts with a parton at a given @xmath0 , latter parton originates from a parent parton at a softer resolution scale @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "as soon as we focus on the production of hadrons at large @xmath3 and small enough @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 ) , we can neglect the fusion of gluons ( quarks ) emitted in the evolution from ( @xmath34 ) to ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the reason is that these partons have transverse momenta larger than @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the simple evolution equations are valid , i.e. , @xmath37 here @xmath38 and @xmath39 label the parton flavors , @xmath40 is the fragmentation function for a residual system with parton @xmath38 removed , and @xmath41 is the hard blob leading to the standard kernel of the dglap evolution equation for inclusive scattering . the quantity @xmath42 , which was defined in eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) , is the light - cone fraction of the momentum of the _ initial _ nucleon carried by the spectator baryon .",
    "conservation of @xmath9 in the evolution equation reflects the spectator origin of the leading baryon . within the discussed above approximations @xmath1 dependence of @xmath43 in eq.([evol ] ) is due to the change of @xmath0 of the `` parent '' quark at @xmath44 scale .",
    "as long as @xmath45 satisfies the condition @xmath46 the factorization expectations of eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) should hold .",
    "however , for fixed @xmath0 , with increase of @xmath1 the essential @xmath47 increase , and at some @xmath1 this inequality should be violated .",
    "hence , in pqcd , we expect that for fixed @xmath0 with increase of @xmath1 the factorization relation would gradually break down leading to a decrease of @xmath48 at large @xmath3 .",
    "very recently , zeus has released @xcite first data on the production of neutrons in the reaction @xmath49 in the target fragmentation region for @xmath50 the authors did not explicitly check factorization by comparing their data with real photon data on neutron production or with data on scattering of circulating protons off the gas in the vacuum tube .",
    "however , qualitatively , the data seem to be consistent with factorization and a weak ( @xmath51 ) dependence of the neutron multiplicity . such comparison high precision tests of factorization since many detector parameter uncertainties would cancel out in the relative measurements .",
    "in the kinematics of sufficiently small @xmath0 in dis , where the qcd evolution equation should be violated , a contribution of multi - pomeron exchanges may appear significant if the rapid increase of the parton distribution with decreasing @xmath0 would not be stopped through the diffusion of small configurations to the soft scale .",
    "indeed , if we write @xmath52 as a sum of diffractive ( rapidity gap ) events and the inelastic contribution , @xmath53 and assume that only double pomeron exchanges are important , we obtain , using agk cutting rules @xcite , that single multiplicity and double multiplicity events have the cross sections @xmath54 respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath55 where we take the diffraction fraction to be 1520% . for diagrams where two pomerons are cut , the spectrum of leading nucleons ( with @xmath56 ) should be reduced substantially similar to the reduction of the spectrum of leading nucleons in the @xmath57 reaction when the incoming nucleon interacts with two nucleons in the target .",
    "substantial fluctuations in the differential multiplicities of particles produced in the central rapidity range were observed at hera for the soft @xmath58 scattering @xcite .",
    "agk cutting rules have predicted such fluctuations .",
    "models which include multi - pomeron exchanges can quantitatively describe the observed multiplicity fluctuations , for a recent summary see ref .",
    "thus , it is quite likely that multi - pomeron exchanges contribute significantly to the large multiplicity tail of these distributions .",
    "hence , we suggest to measure the multiplicity of the leading neutrons as a function of the multiplicity of the hadrons produced at central rapidities . this quantity can be defined as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the multiplicity of hadrons produced in the rapidity interval @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the number of dis events with multiplicity @xmath63 .",
    "screening effects would lead to a decrease of @xmath64 for large @xmath3 if one selects events with particle multiplicity in the central rapidity range satisfying the inequality @xmath65 obviously , no such correlations are expected in the framework of the dglap evolution equations .",
    "it was suggested in a number of papers , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , that the hera collider data on the process of eq .",
    "( [ en ] ) could be used to measure the pion structure function at small @xmath0 .",
    "approximate factorization characteristic of soft qcd processes makes this extreemly difficult ( see however discussion in the end of the paragraph ) since , in this limit , scattering off the pomeron dominates .",
    "scattering of any small @xmath0 partons will lead to essentially the same spectrum of leading neutrons as does hadron - proton scattering .",
    "hence , the spectrum of leading neutrons would be fitted well by a parameterization corresponding to the sum of @xmath67 triple reggeon terms , where @xmath68reggeons , see e.g. ref .",
    "note that in the high - energy limit , which we discuss , the contribution of @xmath69 terms is negligible - reggeon has no simple connection to the @xmath70-meson exchange used in models of the low - energy nn interaction , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , since the effective spin of the @xmath70-reggeon is @xmath71 for small @xmath72 and not 1 .",
    "the same is true for pion exchange away from @xmath73 .",
    "for example , for @xmath74 , which gives the dominant contribution in pion models of the nucleon s antiquark sea @xcite , the pion s effective spin is @xmath75 . ] . at the same time",
    ", there is no simple way to distinguish , in the ( @xmath51 ) limit of eq .",
    "( [ kinem ] ) which was studied by zeus , the scattering of the virtual photon off pions belonging to the nucleon s @xmath76 and @xmath77 components from scattering off other components in the nucleon s wave function .",
    "to estimate the contribution of the scattering off the pion field to the proton s structure function @xmath78 , we use our analysis @xcite of the nucleon s antiquark distributions at @xmath79 .",
    "the latter provides lower limits on the slopes of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 form factors .",
    "note that the lower limit corresponds to the _ maximal _ possible contribution of the pion field .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that , at small @xmath0 and especially with increasing @xmath1 , the pion contribution should be a relatively small fraction of the sea s parton density .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this analysis to the even smaller @xmath0 of the zeus experiment @xcite .",
    "we find that , though in this model the contribution of scattering off the pion field may exceed @xmath82 for @xmath83 , it can not exceed @xmath84 of @xmath85 for the kinematics given by eq .",
    "( [ kinem ] ) , see fig .",
    "1 . there , we show results from fits to two experiments which measured the pion s parton distributions via drell - yan scattering .",
    "the fit to the na24 data @xcite leads to a value of the ratio @xmath86 close to 1 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , while the na10 fit @xcite corresponds to a ratio of about @xmath89 .",
    "so , the results of the calculation based on the na24 fit can be considered an upper limit for the pion contribution to @xmath78 .",
    "besides , we want to stress that since the average relative distances in the @xmath90 configuration are small ( @xmath91 ) @xcite , screening effects , which we neglected in our model calculation of the pion contribution to @xmath92 , would further reduce this contribution .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath85 in the small @xmath0 and @xmath93 range comes thus from the scattering off the gluon field , which , at low @xmath1 resolution , originates predominantly from gluon emission from the valence quarks as well as non - perturbative gluons , and hence does not belong to the pions .",
    "however , based on the factorization argument , we expect that these configurations give a regular , unsuppressed contribution to the neutron spectrum .    within models which explicitly include pion degrees of freedom to the nucleon s wave function ,",
    "scattering off a number of components , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , is important , see fig .",
    "2 . only about @xmath82 of the final states result in the production of neutrons .",
    "hence , the total multiplicity of neutrons in dis due to the pion mechanism can not exceed @xmath99 , though for typical inelastic ( non - diffractive ) events one expects that the baryon multiplicities of protons and neutrons are about equal and close to @xmath82 ( where we neglected the small correction due to the production of strange baryons ) .",
    "this expectation is consistent with bubble chamber neutrino data , which were analyzed , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to really measure the pion structure function ,",
    "one would have to extrapolate to the pion pole , which requires measurements for @xmath100 . since @xmath101 only the region of @xmath102 and @xmath103 could be used for such measurements .",
    "the current angular and momentum resolution of the zeus detector @xcite is approaching requirements necessary for such studies .",
    "however counting rates in this region would be quite low .",
    "note , also , that even interpolation to the pion pole for small @xmath72 would not be simple due to screening effects .",
    "these effects lead to a non - zero value for the cross section at @xmath104 , though in a naive pion exchange model this cross section would be proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "this situation is analogous to the one encountered in low - energy charge exchange reactions where it causes substantial problems for an accurate determination of the @xmath105 coupling constant , for a recent discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "a study of leading baryon production in deep inelastic scattering can shed new light on the interplay of soft fragmentation dynamics and the properties of the nucleon s parton wave function .",
    "it can furthermore provide an effective probe of the deviations from the dglap picture of small @xmath0 deep inelastic scattering .",
