    "for nearly integrable hamiltonian systems , the set of kam tori has a relatively large lebesgue measure in phase space . for systems with two degrees of freedom",
    ", it implies the dynamical stability : all orbits are stable , the variation of actions stays small for all the time as each 2-dimensional kam torus separates the 3-dimensional energy level .",
    "however , this is a special property of lower - dimensional space , kam torus of @xmath5-dimension does not separate @xmath6-dimensional energy level if @xmath7 .",
    "it is conceivable that the complement of all @xmath5-dimensional invariant tori forms dense and connected set in phase space .",
    "this would mean that by arbitrary small changes of the initial states one would find orbits along which the action variables ultimately escape . the underlying phenomenon is now called  arnold diffusion \" .    * conjecture * ( @xcite ) : _ the typical case in a higher - dimensional problems is topological instability : through an arbitrarily small neighborhood of any point there passes a phase trajectories along which the slow variables drift away from the initial value by a quantity of order 1 .",
    "_    since the celebrated example of arnold @xcite was published half a century ago , there are many works for the study of this problem . in recent years",
    ", it has become clear that diffusion is a typical phenomenon in so called _ a priori _ unstable systems , refer to @xcite .",
    "the _ a priori _ unstable condition guarantees the existence of normally hyperbolic cylinder , from which one derives certain regularity of the barrier functions .",
    "the genericity of the diffusion is obtained by using the regularity @xcite .",
    "there are also many works for the study of the problem , for instance , see @xcite .",
    "general perturbation of integrable hamiltonian is usually called _ a priori _ stable system .",
    "a bit away from strong complete resonance in such systems , some pieces of normally hyperbolic cylinder still exist and the method for _ a priori _ unstable system can also be applied @xcite . for _ a priori _ stable systems with three degrees of freedom , a notable difficulty occurs at the point of double resonance , around which the cylinder for prescribed single resonance may disappear .",
    "the averaged system has two homoclinic orbits associated with different classes in @xmath8 . as the energy decreases , the periodic orbit on the cylinder approaches these two homoclinic orbits simultaneously .",
    "thus , the transition chain in @xmath9 for the single resonance may break . to solve this difficulty ,",
    "mather suggested a path in @xmath9 to cross double resonance , along which one moves the cohomology class in the channel determined by the prescribed homology class and switches it to the channel determined by one of these two classes when it is getting close to the double resonance @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the path we choose to construct transition chain is different from that suggested by mather .",
    "we find an annulus surrounding the flat of double resonance in @xmath9 , which has a foliation of circles .",
    "each of these circles is actually a transition chains , possibly , of incomplete intersection .",
    "although the annulus is not so thick , each single resonance path extends into .",
    "it allows us to use one of these circles connecting one single resonance path to another . in this way",
    ", we find a path of transition chain along which the diffusion orbits are constructed by variational method .",
    "we consider nearly integrable hamiltonian systems with 3 degrees of freedom : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is assumed to strictly convex , namely , the hessian matrix @xmath12 is positive definite .",

    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "it is generic not only in usual sense , but also in the sense of ma , namely , it is a typical phenomenon when the system is perturbed by potential .",
    "the same result for time - periodic systems can be proved by using the same method .",
    "the statement of the result is : for typical time - periodic perturbations of integrable hamiltonian with 2-degrees of freedom , the hamiltonian flow admits orbits passing through any prescribed two balls @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the phase space and finitely many small balls @xmath60 @xmath52 in the action variable space .",
    "the proof is easier from technical point of view , one can see it in the proof .",
    "similar result was announced by mather earlier @xcite .",
    "recently , two other groups ( kaloshin and zhang , marco @xcite ) announced , using different approach , a similar result for time - periodic systems with two degrees of freedom .    the result obtained here is stronger than what was formulated in @xcite . by dropping the requirement that orbit passes two prescribed balls in the phase space and using the same construction",
    ", one can get an orbit that visits these balls @xmath51 @xmath52 infinitely many times with any prescribed order , as it was announced in @xcite . indeed , as finitely many balls are given , there exists a path with finite length passing through finitely many resonance layers and connecting any two of these balls directly .",

    "we use variational method to prove the result . since the work of mather @xcite , the variational method has become a powerful tool for the study of dynamical instability in positive definite lagrange systems with multiple degrees of freedom .    in the study of arnold diffusion in _ a priori _ stable systems with three degrees of freedom , mainly due to the work of mather @xcite , it has been widely known that the main difficulty takes place near double resonance . to describe what puzzled us and to explain the strategy of our proof , let us recall the example of arnold and previous study on _ a priori _ unstable systems .    in the example of arnold , there exists a 2-dimensional cylinder in the phase space , which is invariant and normally hyperbolic for the time-1-map determined by the hamiltonian flow .",
    "this cylinder is foliated into a family of invariant circles , each of them has stable and unstable manifold which intersect each other transversally .",
    "consequently , the unstable manifold of some circle intersects the stable manifold of other circles nearby , it implies the existence of a sequence of successively connected heteroclinic orbits . this structure is called transition chain by arnold .",
    "diffusion orbits are then constructed shadowing these heteroclinic orbits .",
    "such argument heavily depends on the geometric structure and variational method turns out to have wider range of application .",
    "let us interpret the proof by variational language .",
    "each invariant circle is the aubry set for certain cohomology class , the stable as well as the unstable manifold is actually the graph of the differential of the weak kam solution .",
    "expressed as the difference of backward and forward weak kam , the barrier function reaches its minimum at primary intersection points of these two manifolds .",
    "these homoclinic orbits and the aubry set constitute the ma set in certain finite covering space . for positive definite systems , the transversal intersection implies the minimality of the homoclinic orbits as well as local heteroclinic orbits , along which the lagrange action reaches the minimum among all those curves with the same boundary conditions .",
    "the diffusion orbits are obtained by searching for global minimizers which generate orbits shadowing a sequence of local heteroclinic orbits .",
    "the variational arguments still work even if there does not exist such nice geometric structure , provided the following conditions are satisfied for each cohomology class    1 , _ the aubry set is lower dimensional : @xmath199 _ ;    2 , _ the stable  manifold \" intersects the unstable  manifold \" transversally_.    however , it turns out very difficult to verify whether the stable  manifold \" intersects the unstable  manifold \" transversally for each cohomology class along a path of first cohomology class . as uncountably many stable and unstable  manifolds \" have to be considered , one can not verify the genericity of the transversal intersection by taking the intersection of countably many open - dense sets .",
    "one possible way is to study some regularity of barrier functions with respect to some parameter , with which one obtains the finiteness of hausdorff dimensions of the set of barrier functions . as such regularity",
    "is obtained in the case when a normally hyperbolic cylinder exists we are succeeded in solving the problem in _ a priori _ unstable case @xcite .",
    "in fact , the regularity was obtained in @xcite only for those barrier functions for which the minimal measure is supported on an invariant circle .",
    "it was extended in @xcite to all other barrier functions , which allows us to construct diffusion orbits of which the picture looks like what was constructed by arnold , while in our previous work , the constructed orbits keep close to the cylinder when they pass through strong resonance ( birkhoff instability region ) .",
    "gap \" problem was then solved .",
    "intuitively , diffusion orbits in _ a priori _ stable systems may be constructed along some resonant path . in terms of rotation vector ( first homology class ) ,",
    "each point on this curve satisfies at least one resonant condition for the system with @xmath200 degrees of freedom . in integrable systems",
    ", each resonant path corresponds to an invariant cylinders without any hyperbolicity . under generic perturbations ,",
    "it breaks into many pieces of normally hyperbolic cylinder , but may disappear around double resonant points .",
    "it implies a bad consequence : we lost a handhold to get certain regularity of barrier functions in suitable parameter .",
    "it then becomes unclear whether there is a transition chain near double resonance .    in terms of first cohomology",
    ", strong double resonance corresponds to a convex disc with size @xmath201 if the perturbation is of order @xmath202 , each piece of normally hyperbolic cylinder corresponds to a channel which extends to a small neighborhood of the disc .",
    "but it is unclear whether these channels are connected to the disc of double resonance .",
    "the method we use to overcome this difficulty bases on following discoveries :    first , each double resonant disc is surrounded by an annulus foliated into a family of paths , along each of these paths , there is another invariant ( a coordinate component of the cohomology class ) besides the average action . for each class in this annulus , the intersection of stable  manifold \" with unstable  manifold \" is nontrivial although it may not be transversal .",
    "this annulus has width of order @xmath202 .",
    "next , incomplete intersection of the stable and unstable  manifold \" of an aubry set does not implies that it can not be connected to any other aubry set nearby . it",
    "does if they are @xmath89-equivalent .",
    "finally , the channels of normally hyperbolic cylinder reach to somewhere @xmath203-close to double resonant disc ( @xmath54 ) , i.e. it has overlap with the annulus . for each class in the channel ,",
    "the relative homology of the aubry set is non - trivial .",
    "therefore , we are able to find a path close to prescribed one , for each class on the path , the aubry set is connected to another one nearby if the class is also on the path .",
    "all of these connecting orbits are minimal in local sense .",
    "the diffusion orbits are constructed shadowing these successively connected orbits .",
    "we organize the proof in following way .",
    "section 2 is used to establish the concept of elementary weak kam , with which one has simpler expression of barrier function .",
    "it thus becomes easier to study genericity of transition chain .",
    "section 3 , 4 and 5 are devoted to study the structure of ma set and of aubry set . since these sets are symplectic invariants @xcite , we do it by studying the normal form which is put into the appendix .",
    "the truncated hamiltonian of the normal form is a system with two degrees of freedom . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the dynamics around the double resonance , and the modulus continuity of the period on energy ( average action ) . with these preliminary works ,",
    "normally hyperbolic cylinder is shown to get very close to the double resonance in section 4 , the existence of annulus of @xmath89-equivalence is established in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to establish two types of local connecting orbits .",
    "the local minimality of these local connecting orbits are naturally given , it enables us to construct global connecting orbit shadowing these local connecting orbits .",
    "it is obtained by searching for the minimizer of certain modified lagrangian , which is done in section 7 .",
    "finally in section 8 , we verify the cusp - residual property of the transition chain in nearly integrable hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom .",
    "consequently , the main result of this paper is proved .",
    "the concept of elementary weak kam solution is introduced for @xmath89-minimal measure with finitely many ergodic components , this condition has been shown to be generic in @xcite . each ergodic component",
