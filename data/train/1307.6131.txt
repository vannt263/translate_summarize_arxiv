    "the ageing term vanishes at large measurement times inverse - proportionally .",
    "while solutions to regular langevin equations with white noise as well as the confined fbm show exponential relaxation of the time averaged msd in the ageing time , solutions to fles exhibit power - law relaxation and power - law ageing with a characteristic exponent between -1 and -3 .",
    "notably , the ageing exponents differ between free and confined fle motion .",
    "the existence of the finite stationary term of the time averaged msd for stochastic processes driven by fractional gaussian noise contrasts the properties of the ctrw process , for which the time averaged msd decays to zero in the respective limits .",
    "the origin of this difference is that a ctrw particle effectively grinds to a complete halt after a sufficiently long time while a free fle particle keeps spreading .",
    "hence , the ageing dynamics in ctrws and the free fle are well distinguishable .",
    "in particular , it should be noted that free fbm , which is equivalent to overdamped free fle motion @xcite does not exhibit ageing at all .",
    "what happens when , instead of fixed initial conditions @xmath71 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 as well as ageing times @xmath1 we analyze an ensemble of trajectories with distributed ageing times or initial conditions ? in such cases our ageing formulas may also be useful . consider the example of free fle motion .",

    "<S> stochastic processes driven by stationary fractional gaussian noise , that is , fractional brownian motion and fractional langevin equation motion , are usually considered to be ergodic in the sense that , after an algebraic relaxation , time and ensemble averages of physical observables coincide . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , it turns out that for fractional langevin equation motion the ageing dependence on @xmath1 is different between the cases of free and confined motion . </S>",
