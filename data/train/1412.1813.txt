    "an approach to colloidal patterning is via evaporation - driven deposition of uniformly dispersed particles in a volatile liquid film  @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism of evaporation - driven patterning involves vapor leaving the suspension more easily along the liquid - air - substrate triple line ( the contact line ) , resulting in a singular evaporative flux profile . the combination of the contact line pinning and a singular evaporative flux there generates a fluid flow that carries the dissolved particles towards the edge of the film  @xcite . the advected colloids then get arrested near the contact line to form patterns such as continuous solid films , or regular bands  @xcite , that are laid down along the substrate .",
    "the evaporative patterns form via a complex dynamics .",
    "the propagation rate of the interface separating the liquid and the colloidal deposit is controlled by the local particle concentration in the solution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](a ) ) and the velocity of the viscous capillary flow transporting the colloids . during this process",
    ", the liquid meniscus pinned to the edge of the deposit deforms as a function of the rate of particle transport and evaporation , in turn dictating the formation of either a continuous film or a periodic band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematics](b)(e ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment0](a)(f ) ) . as a result ,",
    "the particles self - organize into various forms of ordered and disordered states@xcite as a function of the deposition speed and the local evaporation rate  @xcite .",
    "an additional complexity is that the fluid flow regime changes dramatically over the course of the drying process .",
    "initially , we have flow in a thin film that is characterized by the stokes regime away from the deposition front where the particle concentration is low . near the deposition front",
    ", the liquid enters a porous region that is itself created by the particulate deposits at the solid - liquid interface , leading to a darcy regime .",
    "early models  @xcite focused on understanding the singular evaporative flux and the related particulate flux , leaving open mechanisms for the filming - banding transition , the deposition front speed that sets the rate of patterning , and the stokes - darcy transition , questions we answer here .",
    "here we use a combination of experimental observations and theoretical models of the interface growth and colloidal patterning to understand the dynamics of periodic banding , and its transition to the deposition of a continuous film as a function of the particle concentration . based on our observations ,",
    "we formulate two complementary theories : ( 1 ) a coarse - grained two - stage model , which consists of a hydrostatic stage until the meniscus touches down the substrate , followed by rapid contact line motion terminated by its equilibration .",
    "this minimal model allows us to explain the geometry of the periodic bands as a function of the deposition rate .",
    "( 2 ) a detailed multiphase model of the drying , flowing suspension allows us to account for the stokes - darcy transition , and couples the evaporation rate , fluid flow , the meniscus height , the distribution of particle concentration , and the dynamic interface velocity as a function of the initial particle concentration .",
    "this theory leads to explicit predictions for the deposition rate , and the banding - filming transition in good quantitative agreement with the measurements .",

    "<S> drying suspensions often leave behind complex patterns of particulates , as might be seen in the coffee stains on a table . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dynamics of periodic band or uniform solid film formation on a vertical plate suspended partially in a drying colloidal solution . </S>",
    "<S> direct observations allow us to visualize the dynamics of the band and film deposition , and the transition in between when the colloidal concentration is varied . </S>",
    "<S> a minimal theory of the liquid meniscus motion along the plate reveals the dynamics of the banding and its transition to the filming as a function of the ratio of deposition and evaporation rates . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a complementary multiphase model of colloids dissolved in the liquid , which couples the inhomogeneous evaporation at the evolving meniscus to the fluid and particulate flows and the transition from a dilute suspension to a porous plug . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to determine the concentration dependence of the bandwidth and the deposition rate . </S>",
    "<S> together , our findings allow for the control of drying - induced patterning as a function of the colloidal concentration and evaporation rate . </S>"
