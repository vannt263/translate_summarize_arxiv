    "the shape of the imf and whether or not it is universal have been central questions in astrophysics for more than 50 years .",
    "the shape of the stellar part of the imf has been examined observationally in some detail . above 0.5 m@xmath3 ,",
    "the imf derived for field stars is well characterized by a salpeter power law , @xmath9 @xcite . at this characteristic mass ,",
    "the slope of the power law changes to @xmath10 and for masses below 0.1 m@xmath3 the imf flattens further @xcite , although the slope is very uncertain @xcite . to search for variations in the imf as a function of environment , one has to look at individual star  forming episodes , such as star clusters or associations .",
    "young clusters in particular are useful for these studies because the more massive stars are still present in the cluster and the clusters have not experienced significant dynamical mass segregation . recently , the imf studies have been extended deep into the brown dwarf regime in several star forming regions , most notably the orion nebula cluster ( onc , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in order to search for variations in the sub ",
    "stellar imf as a function of environment , a larger ensemble of young clusters is needed . here",
    ", we present a study of the imf in the mon r2 cluster . the embedded cluster associated with mon r2",
    "was originally discovered by @xcite and is located at a distance of 830@xmath1150 pc @xcite .",
    "the most massive star in the cluster is @xmath2 10 m@xmath3 @xcite . @xcite",
    "estimated mon r2 to contain at least 475 stars within a 3.6@xmath03.6 pc region , significantly less than the @xmath2 3500 stars found within a 2.5 pc radius of the onc @xcite .",
    "ic 348 contains @xmath2 400 members including brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "thus , mon r2 has a richness intermediate between the two well studied clusters .",
    "the molecular cloud has been shown by @xcite to have a central density of @xmath12 , much higher than typical densities in the taurus molecular cloud cores ( @xmath13 , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the density of the molecular cores have an impact on the imf as suggested by e.g. @xcite and @xcite , we would expect the imf in mon r2 to have relatively more brown dwarfs than taurus .",
    "previously , @xcite imaged mon r2 down to the brown dwarf limit and obtained spectra for a subset of the stars .",
    "they established the age of the cluster to be @xmath14 3 myr , and that the majority of the low mass stars clustered around the 1 myr isochrone . adopting an age of 1 myr for the stellar population",
    ", they found the ratio of high mass to low mass stars n(110",
    "m@xmath3)/n(0.11 m@xmath3)@xmath15 , which is consistent with other nearby star forming regions @xcite and with a @xcite field star imf .",
    "despite the fact that mon r2 is relatively nearby , the brown dwarf content has not been investigated in a systematic manner . here , we present hst / nicmos 2 near  infrared imaging of the central 0.24pc@xmath00.24pc ( 1 @xmath0 1 ) of the cluster .",
    "our main goal is to constrain the low  mass stellar and brown dwarf content in the cluster and compare the results to those derived for other young clusters and the field .",
    "in addition , we estimate the fraction of stars with disks within our surveyed region .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we present the observations , the data reduction and the photometry .",
    "section 3 presents the results from the color  magnitude and color  color diagrams for the cluster .",
    "we place objects in the hr diagram based on the estimate of the effective temperature derived from the f160w and f165 m band observations . in section 4",
    ", we discuss our constraints on the imf and disk frequency based on extinction limited samples constructed from our observations .",
    "section 5 compares our derived ratios with the similar ratios for other star forming regions .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 6 with a summary of our results .",
    "hst / nicmos2 observations of the central 1@xmath01  of mon r2 were obtained in cycle 7 under program number 7417 .",
    "the field of view for nicmos 2 is 192 square and the pixel scale is 0075 . a @xmath16 grid was observed in the f110w , f160w , f165 m , and f207 m filters , where each position in the grid was observed twice in each filter with a dither offset of @xmath2 20 pixels in both ra and dec .",
    "the total integration time per position in the grid is 512 seconds for f110w , 352 seconds for f160w , 576 seconds for f165 m , and 288 seconds for f207 m .",
    "all the images were obtained in non  destructive readout mode with a total of 16 readouts in each exposure . the full width at half maxima of the point spread function are 012 , 015 , and 020 , for the f110w , f160w , and f207 m bands respectively .",

    "synthetic darks were used based on the software nicred .",
    "the pedestal effect was removed from each frame also using nicred .",
    "bad pixels were identified and corrected using the iraf task fixpix . finally , for each filter , the images were registered and a mosaic was created using the average of the two dithered exposures at each position in the mosaic .",
    "a color composite of the observed region is shown in fig .",
    "[ color ] , where f110w is blue , f160w is green , and f207 m red .",
    "point sources in each of the mosaics were identified using the iraf implementation of daofind with a 5@xmath17 detection threshold .",
    "false detections in the form of noise peaks or structures in the point spread function were eliminated by comparing the source lists from each filter and a visual inspection of each source detected by daofind .",
    "since the location of features in the psf for a given star is dependent on wavelength , the use of different filters helps in separating faint stars next to bright stars from structure in the bright star psf .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using the apphot package in iraf .",
    "an aperture of 3.5 pixel radius was used to measure the flux of the object and the background was measured in an annulus from 10 to 15 pixels . for 10 objects an annulus of 2 pixel",
    "was used to measure the object flux because they were close to bright stars .",
    "the choice of a relatively large aperture for the majority of the sources was to limit photometric errors due to the variations in the psf across the field of view of the nic2 camera .",
    "some 40 stars with no ( or very little ) nebulosity associated with them were used to determine aperture corrections for the photometry in each filter .",
    "the nicmos photometry was measured relative to a 10 pixel radius aperture and is presented in the vegamag system .",
    "the astrometry was done relative to @xcite .",
    "some 25 stars in common were used to fit a second order polynomial in both ra and dec .",
    "the final rms was 01 .",
    "a comparison with 2mass showed an offset by 05 in ra and -03 in dec relative to our astrometry .",
    "we corrected the astrometry for this offset and the rms compared to 2mass is then 02 for 8 relatively bright isolated sources .",
    "table  2 presents the photometry and coordinates for the 181 sources detected together with 2mass ids where available .",
    "where more than one source was within an arcsecond in the hst / nicmos survey , we have chosen the brightest source in our observations as the 2mass source . in four cases , two sources of roughly equal brightness in the nicmos data were identified as one object by 2mass .",
    "both objects have been given the 2mass i d and are marked with an @xmath18 .",
