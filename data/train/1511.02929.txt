    "in this paper , we study t hooft anomalies for finite symmetry groups @xmath1 .",
    "this is the situation where a field theory has a global @xmath1 symmetry which can not be gauged . for simplicity ,",
    "especially when we talk about gauging , we only consider internal symmetries ( no time reversal , fermion parity , etc ) . by gauging",
    "we mean we couple the field theory to a flat @xmath1 gauge field and attempt to preserve @xmath1 gauge invariance by introducing local counterterms involving the original fields and the @xmath1 gauge field .",
    "when it is not possible to assemble such counterterms , we say the system has an t hooft anomaly for the symmetry @xmath1 .    in such situations , the variation of the @xmath0-dimensional action , while not cancellable by local counterterms ,",
    "can often be cancelled by the boundary variation of a @xmath3-dimensional local term for the @xmath1 gauge field .",
    "in such a situation we say @xmath1 satisfies _ anomaly in - flow _ and the @xmath3-dimensional tqft of the @xmath1 gauge field is a sort of universality class of the t hooft anomaly , preserved under rg flow and small perturbations .",
    "a basic question is    do all symmetries satisfy anomaly in - flow ?    in @xcite",
    "this question was answered negatively in the field theory context .",
    "the authors demonstrated a 2 + 1d dijkgraaf - witten theory with an anomalous @xmath1 symmetry too severe to be cancelled by any 3 + 1d theory of just the @xmath1 gauge field .",
    "this is related to the @xmath4 obstruction to finding a @xmath1-crossed braided extension of a modular tensor category that was studied in a mathematical context in @xcite and discussed in a condensed matter context in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "however , we return to the example studied in @xcite and show that if we let the @xmath1 gauge field in 3 + 1d be the 1-form part of a 2-gauge field ( which includes also a 2-form field ) then there is a local term whose boundary variation cancels the anomaly .",
    "in fact we show    all anomalies of dijkgraaf - witten theories satisfy anomaly in - flow after extending @xmath1 to a higher symmetry .",
    "we will show this in the field theory after @xmath1 has been gauged using the serre spectral sequence , which naturally filters the anomalies by their severity ( and also by how ",
    "higher \" the symmetry must be extended ) .",
    "further , in 2 + 1d , where there is a concrete understanding of a fairly general class of tqft s , we show    any @xmath1 symmetry of a modular 2 + 1d tqft satisfies anomaly in - flow after extending @xmath1 to a 2-group with @xmath5 equal to the group of abelian anyons in the tqft .    along the way",
    ", we relate concretely the @xmath4 obstruction we observed in field theory to the @xmath4 obstruction found in @xcite .",
    "our understanding of this obstruction is that it signals an emergent 1-form gauge symmetry that comes along with gauging @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the emergent codimension 2 symmetry defects that proliferate are composed of  associator bubbles \" of @xmath1 domain walls , where the @xmath4 cocycle determines the charge of the bubble .",
    "these sorts of questions have received much recent attention from condensed matter physicists since the discovery of symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phases .",
    "these are gapped systems with @xmath1 symmetry which , after gauging @xmath1 and passing to the ir tqft , we get some non - trivial topological term . if the original system has a symmetric boundary , then @xmath1 has to have an t hooft anomaly on the boundary to cancel the variation of the bulk topological term .",
    "the analog of question 1 in this ",
    "ungauged \" case is    are all @xmath1-symmetric systems realizable on the boundary of a @xmath1 spt phase with an on - site group action ?",
    "it is widely believed that @xmath1 acting on - site in some theory with the same ir fixed point as our system implies the @xmath1 symmetry is non - anomalous .",
    "given this , since the answer to question 1 is no , the answer to question 2 is also no .",
    "however , in @xcite the notion of spt phase was generalized to higher symmetries , which in a lattice model act not just on - site in the non - anomalous case but on vertices , edges , faces , etc . in a controlled way and",
    "whose symmetries form not a group but a @xmath0-group in @xmath0 dimensional spacetime .",
    "we call such a symmetry action ultralocal . in this sense",
    ", we show    any @xmath1-symmetric dijkgraaf - witten theory is realizable on the boundary of a higher spt phase with ultralocal symmetry action",
    ".    all our conclusions can be re - interpreted in terms of anyon condensation using the observation that any abelian anyon acts as the generator of a 1-form symmetry . gauging the 1-form symmetry means proliferating symmetry defects means condensing these anyons .",
    "thus , another way to understand the @xmath4 anomaly is that certain anyons become condensed when the anomalous 0-form symmetry is gauged .",
    "the charge of the condensate is determined by the background 1-form gauge field via the class in @xmath4 .",
    "the remaining anomaly in @xmath6 is an obstruction to forming this condensate in a purely 2 + 1d system , but the condensate can be consistently formed ( as far as tqft rules are concerned ) on the boundary of a 2-spt in 3 + 1d .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a 2 + 1d dijkgraaf - witten theory with gauge group @xmath7 and gauge field @xmath8 .",
    "we consider this theory with the level 1 action @xmath9 see appendix a for an introduction to our field theory notation .",
    "in @xcite , the authors considered gauging a global @xmath10 symmetry of this theory .",
    "this introduces a new @xmath11 gauge field @xmath12 and turns the flatness constraint for @xmath8 into @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a group cocycle classifying a group extension of @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "we call the resulting extended group the total group of symmetries @xmath17 .",
    "we henceforth use the extension @xmath18 .",
    "this cocycle determines how @xmath15 acts projectively on wilson lines .",
    "indeed , the constraint implies that in a non - trivial ( but necessarily flat ) @xmath19 background , the electric charge @xmath20 wilson line @xmath21 can change by a phase if the worldline @xmath22 is deformed .",
    "in particular , if the worldline bounds a disc @xmath23 then the above equals @xmath24    we can think of a configuration of the background @xmath19 as a network of @xmath15 domain walls with codimension 2  zippers \" where pairs of domain walls fuse . then the integral in the exponent can receive a contribution every time @xmath25 intersects one of these zippers . in particular , consider a zipper junction where a @xmath26 and @xmath27 domain wall meet , @xmath28 .",
    "consider @xmath22 to be a small loop linking this zipper ( see fig .",
    "[ zipper ] ) .",
    "the cocycle @xmath14 defines an element @xmath29 , so that a charge @xmath20 test particle accrues a net phase @xmath30 on braiding around the zipper ( along the orange path in fig .",
    "[ zipper ] ) .",

    "more precisely , we should view the charge @xmath20 wilson lines as being the world - lines of particles whose internal hilbert space carries a projective representation of @xmath15 .",
    "this in turn , is equivalent to the statement that these particles carry an honest faithful @xmath17 representation , in a manner we now describe .",
    "recall that @xmath17 is obtained through an extension @xmath34 { } g_{total } \\xrightarrow[\\pi ] { } g_{global}.\\ ] ] we will define the maps @xmath35 explicitly below . to describe the fundamental @xmath17 representation carried by the wilson lines , we embed @xmath17 into the group of @xmath36 unitary matrices @xmath37 with generators @xmath38 @xmath39 these satisfy @xmath40 defining a central element @xmath41 ( i.e. , one which commutes with everything ) .",
    "this relation along with @xmath42 characterize @xmath17 .",
    "now we define the maps named above .",
    "* the map @xmath43 sends the generator @xmath44 to @xmath41 . *",
    "the map @xmath45 sends @xmath46 @xmath47    one checks that these maps make the sequence a central extension .",
    "it will be necessary to choose once and for all a section @xmath48 .",
    "that is , we want a set map satisfying @xmath49 .",
    "this section will be used to define the projective @xmath15 action .",
    "it will not be possible to choose @xmath50 to be a group homomorphism ( one says is not splittable ) .",
    "we choose @xmath51    the fundamental ( @xmath52 ) wilson lines in this theory should be through of as the world - lines of particles whose internal hilbert space transforms in this three dimensional representation just described .",
    "we can associate a wavefunction @xmath53 with the internal hilbert space of the particle .",
    "@xmath53 is an automatically an eigenvector of central element @xmath41 , which generates @xmath16 , with eigenvalue @xmath54 , so these are all charge @xmath52 from the perspective of @xmath16 .",
    "a global symmetry transformation @xmath55 acts by @xmath56 using the section just described .",
    "thus , a particle prepared in state @xmath53 which travels over the zipper ends up in state @xmath57 while one traveling below ends up in state @xmath58 these differ by the operator @xmath59 , which acts by a phase .",
    "this phase equals when @xmath52 .    in the category language",
    "we have essentially tripled the collection of electric quasiparticles by introducing these extra internal degrees of freedom on the charges . the global symmetry generator @xmath60 permutes these three copies , while the global symmetry operator @xmath61 acts by a different @xmath62 charge in each copy .",
    "the relation @xmath63 = 0 $ ] holds only up to the gauge transformation @xmath41 .",
    "the flatness condition for @xmath8 was modified by gauging @xmath15 , and as a result the bare action @xmath64 is no longer @xmath16 invariant .",
    "consider a shift @xmath65 .",
    "this causes a shift @xmath66 modulo integer terms .",
    "previously this term would have disappeared using integration by parts , but that is no longer the case because of the modified flatness constraint , which gives instead a term @xmath67 this term must be cancelled by redefining @xmath68 writing @xmath69 , we can rewrite the action @xmath70 now consider a @xmath62 gauge transformation @xmath71 , but in terms of the integer lifts @xmath72 . since we have already shown invariance under shifts of @xmath73 , we need only show invariance under the lifted gauge transformation @xmath74 . under this variation",
    "the action transforms @xmath75 we can rewrite this variation using @xmath76 @xmath77 the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 commute up to exact terms modulo 3 .",
    "however , they appear with the denominator 9 , so when we bring them past each other , there is a cup-1 correction term to deal with by a shift @xmath80 ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "given this correction , which is safely ignored by the reader , the final variation is @xmath81 this term can be cancelled by a shift @xmath82 iff @xmath83 the 3-cocycle @xmath84 is called the postnikov class . in @xcite it was shown more systematically that this is the only possible local counterterm that can deal with this variation . in particular , @xmath85 should be only a function of @xmath19 , so if the cohomology class @xmath86 \\in h^3(bg_{global},g_{gauge}^*)$ ] is nonzero , there is no way to solve for arbitrary configurations of @xmath19 , so there is an anomaly . , there would be no anomaly , since this variation would be an integer . ]",
    "it was argued in @xcite that this anomaly can not be cancelled by placing the system on a @xmath15 spt boundary . to see this , first note that our action is @xmath87 write the lagrangian density @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath17 gauge invariance is equivalent to @xmath89 . as in @xcite ,",
    "one computes @xmath90 for some 4-cochain @xmath91 .",
    "anomaly in - flow in this situation means that by placing the 3d spacetime @xmath60 on the boundary of a 4d spacetime @xmath61 , the composite action @xmath92 is @xmath17 gauge invariant .",
    "however , when the third term is nonvanishing , the @xmath16 field @xmath8 must live on @xmath61 rather than be constrained to the boundary .",
    "this gauge field is there even before gauging the @xmath15 symmetry , so the bulk state is not short range entangled before gauging ; it is not an spt .",
    "rather we say it is a kind of symmetry enriched topological order , or set for short .",
    "however  and this is the novelty of this paper  instead of requiring @xmath85 be determined by @xmath19 , we can let @xmath85 be a dynamical bulk 2-form satisfying equation ( and we constrain @xmath19 so that this constraint equation has solutions ) . in this case",
    ", it is always possible to cancel the anomaly using a 4d theory with action @xmath93 note that this action does not involve @xmath8 ! neither , as in previous cases @xcite , is this action an @xmath94 cocycle obtained from gauging a traditional spt . instead",
    ", this action come from gauging a higher symmetry of a short range entangled state .",
    "indeed , this action describes a generalized dijkgraaf - witten theory for the _ 2-group _ we call @xmath95 defined by @xmath96 , @xmath97 , to denote the pontryagin dual of @xmath16 .",
    "that is , @xmath98 . for finite abelian groups , they are isomorphic , but the @xmath4 anomaly lives naturally in @xmath99 , so we prefer this notation .",
    "it is also important to distinguish the @xmath100 action , which is a global symmetry , from the @xmath16 gauge symmetry .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ dwgeneral ] for more details . ] and postnikov invariant @xmath101 .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that such a tqft is the gauged effective field theory of a certain generalized spt phase ( called a 2-spt ) protected by a symmetry action of this 2-group .",
    "that is , while our anomaly is too severe to live on the boundary of an spt phase , it can live on the boundary of a 2-spt phase !",
    "let us pause to give a simplification of @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath85 be a @xmath62 valued cochain satisfying .",
    "we consider @xmath103 if we pick a different integer lift of @xmath85 , @xmath104 shifts by a term divisible by @xmath105 , so @xmath106 shifts by a term divisible by @xmath107 .",
    "similarly , if we shift @xmath78 by @xmath108 for some integer 2-cochain @xmath32 , because of the constraint , @xmath104 shifts by @xmath109 , so again @xmath106 is invariant mod @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , for any configuration of the @xmath95 gauge field , we can produce a configuration of a @xmath110 2-form gauge field .",
    "in terms of @xmath106 , the 4d action is rewritten as @xmath111 which can be verified by expanding @xmath112 mod @xmath107 using the definition of @xmath106 above .",

    "the 0-form and 1-form symmetries are truly coupled .",
    "this is contrasted with the case where the postnikov class @xmath123 is exact , when we can perform this separation .",

    ". thus , a global 0-form transformation preserves @xmath161 and therefore also @xmath156 .",
    "one easily checks the same for 1-form transformations .",
    "the expression allows us to determine the nonlocal symmetry action on a boundary state of the 2-spt .",
    "see @xcite for a clear exposition of these ideas in the ordinary spt case .    in the case that @xmath60 has boundary ,",
    "the phases in can not be written as integrals of @xmath162 over the cone @xmath149 , since @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , the invariance of @xmath147 under @xmath95 transformations does not imply that is invariant when @xmath164 .",
    "indeed , one can find a second descendant @xmath165 satisfying @xmath166 this causes a shift @xmath167 where @xmath168 are the operators @xmath169 @xmath170 these operators commute so quantization of these descendants is unambiguous up to an overall phase .",
    "note this rederives that @xmath156 is @xmath95 invariant when @xmath171 . to have a symmetric state , we need to introduce boundary physics that transforms by an opposite phase . in the notation of @xcite ,",
    "this is the operator @xmath172 .",
    "further descendants may be computed as well .",
    "for instance , we may ask if the symmetry acts projectively on the boundary .",
    "in other words , we compute the difference between applying @xmath173 followed by @xmath174 and just applying @xmath175 all at once : @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 for some 1-cochain @xmath179 . thus ,",
    "since the spatial boundary is closed , we get an honest global symmetry action .",
    "however , we find that if we restrict the action to a region @xmath180 of the boundary which itself has boundary , only applying the symmetry action to its interior , then there is a necessary boundary correction @xmath181 in @xcite , this corresponds to the operator @xmath182 .",
    "likewise one can compute the last descendant @xmath183 , which corresponds to @xmath184 .",
    "note that the last descendant can be thought of as an element in @xmath185 , which characterizes this 2-spt phase .",
