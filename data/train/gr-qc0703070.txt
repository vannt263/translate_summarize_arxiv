    "when the geometry around a black hole is slightly perturbed , a characteristic ringdown wave is emitted .",
    "this kind of phenomenon is known as _ quasinormal ringing _ , which is expressed as a superposition of _ quasinormal modes _",
    "the central frequencies and the damping times of quasinormal modes are determined by the geometry around the black hole , and thus the gravitational quasinormal ringing of a black hole is expected to play the important role of connecting gravitational - wave observation to astronomy .",
    "although quasinormal modes are themselves linear perturbations , they are in many cases excited after _ nonlinear _ evolution of a black hole , such as the black hole formation after the merger of binary neutron stars .",
    "therefore , in order to fully understand the emission process of quasinormal ringing in such a situation , one has to resort to numerical relativity , which needs extremely powerful computational resources .",
    "interestingly , an alternative way to study the physics of black holes has been proposed . in a transonic fluid flow",
    ", sound waves can propagate from the subsonic region to the supersonic region , but can not in the opposite direction . therefore , the sonic point of transonic flow can be considered as the `` event horizon '' for sound waves , and the supersonic region as the `` black hole region '' . for this reason , a transonic fluid flow is sometimes called an _ acoustic black hole _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the wave equation for sound waves in an inhomogeneous flow is precisely equivalent to the wave equation for a massless scalar field in a curved spacetime  @xcite .",
    "this implies that an acoustic black hole also has the quasinormal modes , and that one can study the physics of quasinormal ringing without resorting to numerical relativity , ultimately _ in laboratories_. although the quasinormal modes of acoustic black holes have been studied in some recent works  @xcite , it was still an open issue whether they are actually excited and , if so , how they can be excited .    in this paper , we show some results of our numerical simulations to prove that the quasinormal ringing of sound waves is actually emitted from acoustic black holes in some situations , just as a real black hole emits the quasinormal ringing of gravitational waves . for future experiments in laboratories ,",
    "we treat one of the most accessible models of acoustic black holes : a transonic flow of air in a _ laval nozzle _  @xcite .",
    "a laval nozzle is a wind tunnel that is narrow in the middle , and is widely used to accelerate a fluid supersonically . with this nozzle",
    ", we can easily materialize a stable transonic flow in a laboratory , just by exerting a sufficiently large pressure difference between both ends of the nozzle .",
    "in addition , it is known that the sonic point is always formed at the _ throat _ , where the nozzle radius becomes the smallest .",
    "thus , we do not need to search for the position of the sonic point in experiments .",
    "a quasinormal mode is characterized by a complex frequency ( called _ quasinormal frequency _ ) @xmath0 , or equivalently , a pair of the central frequency @xmath1 and the quality factor @xmath2 .",
    "the quality factor is a quantity that is propotional to the number of cycles of the oscillation within the damping time . in experiments ,",
    "a damping oscillation like a quasinormal ringing is inevitably buried in noise within a few damping times .",
    "therefore , for detecting the quasinormal ringing efficiently , it is important to design a laval nozzle which yields a quasinormal mode with a_large quality factor_.    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the schrdinger - type wave equation for sounds , which describes the  curvature scattering \" of sound waves in an acoustic black hole , and compute the quasinormal frequencies of transonic airflow in laval nozzles with known semianalytic methods . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the results of our fully - nonlinear numerical simulations to prove that the quasinormal modes of are actually excited in two different types of situations . in sec",
    ".  iv , we discuss how the quasinormal ringing changes when any outgoing waves are reflected at the upstream end of the apparatus . sec .",
    "v is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "in what follows , we assume that the radius of the laval nozzle @xmath3 varies sufficiently slowly along the axis of the nozzle ( @xmath4-direction ) and the airflow in the nozzle can be considered as quasi - one - dimensional .",
    "in addition , we neglect viscosity and heat conduction throughout .",
    "the basic equations for quasi - one - dimensional flow of a perfect fluid are @xmath5 = 0 \\ , , \\label{eq : momentum } \\\\ \\pd_t(\\eps a ) +   \\pd_x[(\\eps+p)va ] = 0 \\ , , \\label{eq : energy}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the density , @xmath7 is the velocity , @xmath8 is the pressure , @xmath9 is the cross section of the nozzle , and = v^2 + is the energy density and @xmath10 is the heat capacity ratio for air .",
    ",  , and   are the equation of continuity , the momentum equation , and the energy equation , respectively . insted of eq .  , we can use euler s equation @xmath11 which is derived from eqs .   and  .",

    "we omit the bars over the background quantities .    next , we consider the stationary background and fourier transform @xmath25 in terms of @xmath26 : _ ( x ) = ( t , x)e^itdt .",
