    "it is clear now that on the basis of eq.([sec_2_7a ] ) we can connect solutions in the boundary domains @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "we can then write down solutions of ( [ sec_1_1 ] ) for each of these domains .",

    ", we get the probability conservation equation for reflection and transition amplitudes , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 where summations are over such @xmath76 for which @xmath77 and @xmath78 are real , i.e. , over the open channels .",
    "this equation permits us to interpret @xmath79 and @xmath80 as reflection and transition probabilities for a tunneling process in which absorption ( @xmath81 ) or emission ( @xmath82 ) of energy @xmath83 by electrons occurred @xcite . in case of a monochromatic laser field",
    "this process can be interpreted as absorption or emission of @xmath76 photons from the laser field .",
    "the unitary condition ( [ unit_5 ] ) can be also interpreted as the conservation of electric charge . to this end , let us define the quantities proportional to the density of electric currents , @xmath84 then eq . ( [ unit_5 ] ) adopts the form of the first kirchhoff low , @xmath85    using ( [ sec_2_7a ] ) we can calculate constants @xmath86 and @xmath87 appearing in equations ( [ unit_1 ] ) - ( [ unit_3 ] ) . indeed , since @xmath88 where transfer matrix @xmath89 , and because @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 adopt the following block forms , @xmath93 we arrive at @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 denote the columns of @xmath73 i @xmath74 , and @xmath97_{n}=\\delta_{0,n}$ ] .",
    "thus , after some algebraic manipulations , we have , @xmath98 which allows us to determine the quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 for a given transfer matrix @xmath90 . for open channels , these quantities are the amplitudes of reflection ( @xmath73 ) and transition ( @xmath74 ) probabilities , from which one can compute reflection and transition probabilities using equations ( [ unit_6 ] ) and ( [ unit_7 ] ) .",
    "we note from equations ( [ sec_2_5 ] ) and ( [ sec_2_10 ] ) that each of the @xmath99 matrices that constitute the transfer matrix @xmath55 contain elements @xmath100 that depend on the @xmath101 coordinates at which the discontinuities appear . for closed channels , that is when the @xmath102 momenta are purely imaginary , these numbers are real and may assume arbitrary values , very large or very small , depending again on the @xmath101 coordinates .",
    "number of the @xmath99 matrices is equal to the number of discontinuity points , that is it depends on how we divide the space into short intervals in order to make our potential tractable by our algorithm .",
    "it may therefore turn out that in order to compute the transfer matrix @xmath55 , we have to multiply a large number of the @xmath99 matrices , each containing both very small and very large numbers .",
    "it is clear that such a procedure is numerically unstable .",
    "we have to find a way to modify our method of calculations in order to compute the elements of each @xmath99 matrix at the same point @xmath103 independently of where the ` real ' @xmath101 is .",
    "this would eliminate `` dangerous '' @xmath100 elements ( turning them to @xmath104 ) , however at the cost of appearing somewhere else .",
    "we shall see later that these ` left - overs ' of the shift into @xmath103 appear only as differences @xmath105 and therefore do not cause any harmful side - effects .",
    "we shall see now that such a modification is possible and the price we pay for it is worth the effort .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ sec_2_7a ] ) that in the neighboring domains , @xmath106 and @xmath4 , we have , @xmath107 although the elements of the transfer matrix @xmath108 have been computed from the continuity conditions at point @xmath44 , one can compute them at any other point , for example @xmath103 . to this end , let us notice what follows from the form of the solution ( [ sec_1_7 ] ) .",
    "translation of the system by a certain distance @xmath109 along the @xmath110-axis causes only multiplication of each member of the sum over @xmath76 in ( [ sec_1_7 ] ) by a constant @xmath111 .",
    "these constants can be included in coefficients @xmath23 . in this way",
    "we get a new set of constants which we shall denote as @xmath112 , @xmath113 we shall interpret these constants as coefficients in solution ( [ sec_1_7 ] ) , given by the continuity conditions at point @xmath114 .",
    "( [ sec_3_2 ] ) written in the matrix form becomes , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 in the equation above @xmath118 is a diagonal matrix , @xmath119_{nn'}=\\delta_{nn'}\\exp{(\\mathrm{i}\\sigma p_{in}\\delta ) } , \\label{sec_3_5}\\ ] ] whereas @xmath35 and @xmath120 are the columns of the constants @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively , that is @xmath123_{n}=c_{in}^{\\pm}$ ] and @xmath124_{n}=c_{in}^{\\pm}$ ] .",
    "it follows from the form of the matrix @xmath125 that the following relations are satisfied : @xmath126 @xmath127    let us notice also that translation of the system defined above modifies the transfer matrix @xmath108 .",
    "we have @xmath128 thus @xmath129 and we can write it down as @xmath130 where @xmath131 matrix elements denoted with the tilde symbol refer to the translated system . using the method defined above and the relation ( [ sec_2_7a ] ) , we can connect now the solution in the domain @xmath56 with the solution in any other domain @xmath4 . in this way the elements of the transfer matrix , which have been computed until now at the points of discontinuity @xmath132 , are computed now each time at the same point @xmath103 .",
    "let us illustrate this method for a special case of @xmath133 @xmath134 equation ( [ sec_3_12 ] ) connects constants @xmath91 and @xmath135 using the matrices @xmath136 all computed at @xmath103 independently of @xmath137 , and diagonal matrices @xmath138 , given by the relations ( [ sec_3_4b ] ) and ( [ sec_3_5 ] ) , where @xmath139 . edge matrices @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the equation ( [ sec_3_12 ] ) can be omitted while computing the transmission and reflection probability amplitudes since their only role is to multiply the amplitudes by phase quotients which disappear while computing the probabilities .",
    "although these matrices lead to significant modifications of the closed channels in the domains of @xmath142 and @xmath143 in this particular case , these channels do not influence the reflection and transition amplitudes .",
    "transmission and reflection probabilities can thus be computed using a modified transfer matrix , @xmath144 the matrices @xmath145 are equal to the matrices @xmath146 in eq .",
    "( [ sec_2_12 ] ) calculated however for @xmath147 .",
    "this fact speeds up numerical calculations since now matrix @xmath148 in eq .",
    "( [ sec_2_12 ] ) have to be inverted only once .",
    "further on we shall omit the superscript @xmath149 in @xmath90 and the tilde over @xmath150 in order to simplify notation .    the method presented above",
    "is still numerically unstable .",
    "the reason for this instability lies in the existence of large numerical values of elements of the @xmath151 matrix for imaginary momenta @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , for @xmath152 the source of numerical instabilities are matrix elements @xmath153 that contain large numbers .",
    "there is however a chance for improving the stability , if only its reverse will be used , @xmath154 .",
    "it appears that it is possible provided that in our numerical algorithm only the so - called scattering matrix will be applied . for this reason we will show below how to compute the scattering matrix , @xmath155 , using only elements of the transfer matrix , @xmath156 . for the transfer matrix @xmath156",
    "we have , @xmath157 thus , @xmath158 on the basis of ( [ sec_3_16 ] ) we now want to compute the elements of the @xmath155 matrix .",
    "this matrix is supposed to connect the coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath159 in the following way , @xmath160 using the set of linear equations ( [ sec_3_16 ] ) , we easily compute the coefficients @xmath161 and @xmath162 on the left - hand side of equation ( [ sec_3_17 ] ) , as functions of the coefficients @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "we get then the following relations , @xmath165 finally we compute the elements of the matrix @xmath155 , @xmath166 as expected , the matrix @xmath155 contains only numerically stable elements @xmath167 .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ sec_2_7a ] ) that the transfer matrix @xmath156 can be written as the product of two transfer matrices , @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) , @xmath171 where matrices @xmath168 and @xmath169 are defined as follows , @xmath172 applying the method presented above , for each of the transfer matrices @xmath168 and @xmath169 we can construct a scattering matrix , @xmath173 and @xmath174 respectively .",
    "elements of the scattering matrix @xmath155 can be computed using only elements of the matrices @xmath173 and @xmath174 . using the notation above ,",
    "we obtain the following expressions for the elements of the @xmath155 matrix , @xmath175 it is clear from the above that the @xmath155 matrix is not merely a product of two matrices @xmath173 and @xmath174 , but rather a complicated nonlinear composition of them .",
    "it is important however to note that despite its evident complexity , such a construction of the scattering matrix is numerically stable , as opposed to the transfer matrix method which fails if a system with a large number of discontinuity points @xmath101 is considered .",
    "stability of such an algorithm has been proven in our numerical investigations by checking that the condition ( [ unit_5 ] ) is satisfied with an error smaller than @xmath176 .",
    "such an accuracy can never be achieved for systems with a large number of discontinuity points if the transfer matrix is applied .",
    "in our model investigations , we concentrate on some essential features of the solid - vacuum interface , as exemplified by the sommerfeld model , in which the band structure is neglected .",
    "this simplification allows us to consider a quite general form of the laser field . to be more specific ,",
    "the solid surface is described by a continuous step potential @xmath177 with @xmath178 the parameter @xmath179 determines the skin depth of a surface . for @xmath180 ,",
    "the surface potential represents the step function , commonly used in the sommerfeld model . in our illustrations",
    ", we put @xmath181 .",
    "we apply our theory to the gold surface and assume that the electron effective mass is close to the free electron mass . the work function and the fermi energy for the gold metal",
    "are equal to 5.1 and 5.53 ev , respectively .",
    "this means that the constant @xmath182 above ( as the sum of the work function and the fermi energy ) equals 10.63 ev .",
    "the surface potential described above can be generalized further to meet conditions suitable for other solids . in particular",
    ", one can take into account the space - dependent effective mass of electrons in semiconductor heterostructures or metals with effective masses different from the free electron mass .",
    "on the other hand , the form of the laser field is assumed to depend on both space and time coordinates . since , for laser pulses of duration @xmath183 fs and the 800 nm wavelength , the monochromatic approximation works well , we therefore adopt the following form for the laser electric field : @xmath184 where @xmath185 and similarly @xmath186 the parameter @xmath187 defines the plasmon - enhanced part of the laser field . for the incident laser beam ,",
    "we choose the ti : sapphire laser beam of frequency @xmath188 ev ( @xmath189 nm ) .",
    "this means that inside the solid the laser field intensity averaged over the time period decays exponentially , @xmath190 on the other hand , in vacuum , it stays constant close to the surface , and then again decays exponentially . in this way",
    ", we can mimic a real physical situation in which the radiation - filled space is finite . in our illustrations , we take @xmath191 , which means that the penetration depth of the laser field intensity equals @xmath192 . the parameter @xmath193 describes the distance in a solid at which the intensity is not reduced substantially . on the other hand , @xmath194 corresponds to the laser focus diameter in vacuum , whereas @xmath195 alone determines the intensity reduction rate outside the focus .",
    "similar parameters with the subscript @xmath196 refer to the plasmon - enhanced part of the laser field .",
    "the remaining parameters have been chosen as follows : @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 .",
    "all dimensional parameters are in atomic units .    , @xmath205 and @xmath206 , respectively .",
    ", width=264 ]    in our discussions presented below , the laser field intensity is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the ponderomotive energy of electrons in the monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave of frequency @xmath10 ; hence @xmath209 . in fig .",
    "[ syst ] we draw the space - dependence of the continuous step potential @xmath2 and the electric field amplitude @xmath210 for @xmath211 and @xmath212 .",
    "and for six values of @xmath187 .",
    ", width=264 ]    the total photo - emission probability is equal to @xmath213 we plot it in fig .",
    "[ trans10 ] as a function of the electron kinetic energy for @xmath212 and for six values of @xmath187 .",
    "we clearly see the multi - photon structure in this distribution , i.e. , the total probability jumps sometimes by a few orders of magnitude if the smaller number of laser photons is sufficient for photo - emission .",
    "as expected , the plasmon effect usually increases the photo - emission probability .",
    "moreover , the energy of the multi - photon channel opening increases with increasing @xmath187 , which is due to the increase of the space - dependent ponderomotive energy of the laser field .",
    "the significance of this effect for the tunneling phenomena is going to be discussed in due course .",
    "as mentioned above , our algorithm is convergent provided that a sufficient number of discretization points is introduced . for systems considered here , this number should not be smaller than 100 .",
    "if the laser field is very weak , this does not create significant numerical problems , except that calculations become longer .",
    "however , when the laser field is sufficiently intense , the algorithm based on the transfer matrix is unstable .",
    "this instability is due to the existence of closed channels , which introduce into numerical calculations very small and very large numbers at the same time . augmenting precisions",
    "significantly slows down the calculation and does not diminish the problem .",
    "we have found that it is possible to make this algorithm numerically stable by just applying nonlinear matrix transformations , without introducing higher precisions .",
    "illustrations presented in this paper show that photo - emission of electrons can be changed significantly by applied nonperturbative oscillating in time and space - dependent electric field .",
    "the efficiency of the algorithm presented in this contribution opens up the possibility of investigating surface phenomena in the presence of more realistic laser pulses that gradually decrease within solids and extend on a mesoscopic scale in vacuum .",
