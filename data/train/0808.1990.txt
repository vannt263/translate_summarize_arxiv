    ", the raising of new technologic fields has brought more motivations for the study of these techniques of reconstruction .",
    "for example , in the field of quantum information , protocols like teleportation @xcite and superdense coding @xcite require initially knowing the quality of the quantum channel which is being used for implementing them .    in spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) one photon from a pump beam incident onto a non - linear crystal originates , with small probability , two other photons usually called signal ( s ) and idler ( i ) or also twin photons @xcite .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated that by exploring the transverse momentum correlations of the twin photons it is possible to generate entangled states of two effective @xmath0-dimensional quantum systems @xcite . because the dimension of the hilbert space of these photons is defined by the number of different ways available for their transmission through apertures where they are sent to , we call them spatial qudits .    in this work",
    "we investigate the state determination of these quantum systems .",
    "we show , theoretically , that one can implement the process of qtr to obtain the density operators of two spatial qubits ( @xmath1 ) states . the theoretical description of our protocol is closely related to the description given in ref .",

    "even though we have considered just the case of qubits , the description used here can be generalized to spatial qudits states .",
    "the angular spectrum of the pump beam is transferred to the two - photon state generated by spdc , when the monochromatic , paraxial and thin crystal approximations are assumed @xcite .",
    "the spectral matching is implemented by inserting narrow bandwidth interference filters in front of the detectors @xcite .",
    "the state of twin photons when they are transmitted through generic apertures , under above approximations , can be written in one dimension as @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the fock state for one photon in mode @xmath4 with transverse wavevector @xmath5 .",

    "the @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) state is a single - photon state defined , up to a global phase factor , by @xmath23 and represents the photon in mode @xmath14 transmitted by the upper ( lower ) slit of its respective double slit .",
    "these states form an orthonormal basis in the two - dimensional hilbert space of each photon and are used to define the twin photons logical spatial qubit states .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the state @xmath24 represents a system composed of two spatial qubits .",
    "a typical setup used to generate the spatial qubits is outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . a pump beam incident upon a non - linear crystal generates spdc the twin photons which are correlated in their transverse momenta .",
    "these photons are then sent through identical double slits ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) placed at the @xmath8-plane and , after being transmitted by these apertures , the twin photons will be in the state of eq .",
    "( [ estqubit ] ) .",
    "for doing the quantum tomographic reconstruction of two - qubit states codified in polarization it is necessary to consider the detection of these qubits in some polarization states .",
    "the measurement bases that are usually considered in the experiments are @xcite : @xmath27 ( horizontal and vertical polarizations ) , @xmath28 ( linearly polarized light at @xmath29 and @xmath30 with respect to the horizontal polarization , respectively ) , and @xmath31 ( left and right circularly polarized lights , respectively ) .",
    "the measurement ( the projection ) in one of the states of these bases is represented by a projector operator , and an adequate choice among the available projections allows the reconstruction of the composite state .",
    "now we show how the spatial qubits can be measured in distinct bases of \\{@xmath32}. after being transmitted by the double slit , the twin photons freely evolve in space . because of diffraction , it spreads out faster in the @xmath12-direction so that it passes from the discrete states @xmath33 , to states continuously distributed along this transverse direction . in a certain @xmath34-plane",
    "situated far behind the double slits plane ( @xmath35 ) , each particular superposition of the basis states @xmath36 will have a specific transverse probability distribution @xcite . to recover the discrete nature of the logical states in this @xmath34-plane , we need to implement an adequate postelection process for the twin photons . as we shall show in the following lines , this can be properly done by allocating in this plane one double slit for the transmission of each mode @xmath14 .",
    "we refer to these new apertures as detection double slits .",
    "the transverse position of their slits are @xmath37 where the subscript @xmath14 denotes the mode at which the double slit was placed ( again @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 stands for the lower and upper slit of this aperture , respectively .",
    "the slits width is @xmath40 .",
    "the superscript @xmath41 is used to define a set of measurements . for a certain value of @xmath41",
    "we have two transverse positions available , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for the slits of the double slit .",
    "it can be seen as the mean position of the double slit s center and , as we shall see , it is the index which defines the spatial measurement basis which is being considered .",
    "the state of the twin photons that crossed these two detection double slits can be written as @xmath44 where the states @xmath45 are the states of the postselected photons which crossed the slit in the transverse position @xmath46 of the double slit placed in mode @xmath14 .",
    "these states are given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and one can see that the logical states used to describe the twin photons are once again discrete . the calculation of the state @xmath49 is shown in [ a1 ] .",
    "however , what is really interesting to note now is that there is a relation between the coefficients of this state and the coefficients of the original state of the twin photons given by eq .",
    "( [ estqubit ] ) . that is @xmath50 with @xmath51 therefore",
    ", one can think of the state of the twin photons transmitted through the detection double slits [ eq .  ( [ psitrans ] ) ] as the original state of these photons [ eq .  ( [ estqubit ] ) ] rewritten in the new basis \\{@xmath52 } ( again @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) . as we mentioned before , the spatial bases are designed in terms of @xmath41 . for distinct values of @xmath41 one",

    "we use the superscripts @xmath57 to denote distinct bases .",
    "the post - selection of the twin photons in one of the basis states of \\{@xmath52 } is then represented by the following projector : @xmath58",
    "as is discussed in ref @xcite , the density operator of two qubits is specified by sixteen real parameters .",
    "thus , for determining their state , one needs to construct sixteen equations that are linearly independent and that are functions of measurable quantities . from now on we refer to these equations as mli equations ( measurable and linearly independent equations ) . in this section",
    "we show how this can be done for the spatial qubits state of eq .",
    "( [ estqubit ] ) . to do this",
    "we first remind the reader of some basic results of the two photons interferometry theory .",
    "the photodetection of a @xmath59-photon ( at @xmath60,t ) followed by the detection of a @xmath61-photon ( at @xmath62,@xmath63 ) is described by the fourth - order correlation function which is defined as @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the two photon state and @xmath66 are the positive and negative parts of the electric field operator .",
    "the coincidence rate of these photons ( at @xmath60,t,@xmath62,@xmath63 ) is , therefore , given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant related to the total number of photon pairs sent to the detection apparatus and to its efficiency .",
    "we can now explain the protocol for doing the reconstruction of the two spatial qubits state given by eq .",
    "( [ estqubit ] ) . to start with this ,",
    "let us first assume the following general formula for its density operator @xmath69 : @xmath70 where the indices @xmath71 assume the values @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) when denoting the upper ( lower ) slits of the double slits @xmath74 s .",
    "for example , the matrix element , @xmath75 , is the probability of detecting the twin photon signal at the slit  + \" and the idler photon at the slit  - \" .    to construct the first set of mli equations , one should first measure the coincidence rates with two detectors ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) placed just behind the slits of the apertures @xmath25 and @xmath26 as is shown in fig  [ fig2](a ) .",
    "four mli equations can be constructed by permuting the detector positions behind the slits of these two double slits .",
    "the coincidences rates behind these slits , according to eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , can be written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the number of the photon pairs transmitted through the double slits and @xmath80 the coincidence counts efficiency for the detectors used .",
    "@xmath81 is the projector operator given by @xmath82 .",
    "if we work out this expression we will see that @xmath83 and , therefore it is clear that , after doing the normalization of the coincidence counts seen in this part of the experiment , one will be able to determine the diagonal elements of the spatial qubits density operator @xmath69 .",

    "they are fixed behind the detection double slits whose slit transverse positions are : @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in ( c )",
    "one detector records the idler photons transmitted by the slits of @xmath25 and the other , the photons transmitted by the signal detection double slit.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to obtain four more mli equations one should now introduce the detection double slits in the @xmath34-plane , with their slits at the transverse positions @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( again , @xmath48 ) , and record the coincidence rates with the detectors @xmath86 s behind these slits [ see fig .  [ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the new coincidences rates are now written in terms of the projectors of eq .",
    "( [ pz ] ) and are given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the transverse size of the idler and signal diffraction patterns ( caused by the apertures @xmath74 s ) at the @xmath34-plane , is defined by the transverse length of the three principal peaks of diffraction .",
    "however , we can say that eq .",
    "( [ czz ] ) is a good approximation for the values of the coincidence rates considered since most of the intensity of the light scattered by a double slit lies in this @xmath88 region . ] .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the factor @xmath89 is a normalization constant which accounts for the effect of one photon diffraction , which causes a reduction of @xmath89 in the detector s efficiency that is being used to record this photon at the @xmath34-plane . from these measurements",
    "one will be able to determine the imaginary and real parts of some of the matrix elements of @xmath69 . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we give a summary showing which are the components of @xmath69 that are determined from the measurements considered in this protocol .",
    "there is also a comparison with the measurements done in the qtr of two polarized qubits @xcite . in [ a2 ]",
    "we give the expressions which relate the elements of @xmath69 and all the coincidence rates considered in this protocol .",
    "let us now consider the detection of the signal photons behind its detection double slit at the @xmath34-plane and the detection of the idler photons behind the slits of the double slit @xmath25 ( at the @xmath8-plane ) as it is schematically shown in fig .  [ fig2](c ) .",
    "the four possible coincidence rates obtained , again by permuting the detectors positions behind the slits of these double slits , are now written as @xmath90 with again @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) for the detection of the idler photon at the upper ( lower ) slit of @xmath25 .",

    "so , after performing the sixteen measurements described above , one will have reconstructed the density operator @xmath69 of the two spatial qubits state generated in the experiment considered .",

    "furthermore , there are not requirement for numerical aperture of the detectors .",
    "the technique of qtr is based on a linear inversion of the measured data as was shown above for the two spatial qubits states .",
    "thus , it is dependent on any experimental errors that may occur while recording the data .",
    "they can appear as a consequence of experimental noise or misalignment and the reconstructed state is , in general , only a reasonable approximation of the real quantum state .",
    "the density matrices obtained may have properties that are not fully compatible with a quantum state .    to generate only possible density matrixes",
    "there is an alternative that has been used during the state determination .",
    "it is the numerical technique called maximum likelihood estimation @xcite .",
    "however , even though it generates only possible density matrixes , it has the drawback of enhancing the uncertainty in the state estimation .",
    "once the two qubit density operator is reconstructed with the technique proposed here , one can apply the matrix obtained to this numerical optimization . in ref",
    "@xcite a practical approach for doing this is extensively discussed and it can also be applied for two spatial qubits systems .",
    "in conclusion , we have theoretically shown that one can use the technique of quantum tomography to reconstruct states composed of two spatial qubits . even though we have considered the state determination only for this special case , we believe that it can be generalized and performed in a similar way for spatial states of more dimensions .",
    "the importance of this work comes from the possibility of using the spatial qubits for quantum communications protocols where the ability to characterize may be necessary .",
    "the main advantage that we can envisage at this stage is the possibility of using transverse correlations of the down - converted photons for encoding quantum information in qudits instead of qubits . besides",
    ", even in the case of qubits we see some other important advantages . for instance ,",
    "when entangled polarization qubits are propagated through optical fibers they suffer decoherence because of the depolarization effect of the fibers .",
    "the birrefrigence of the fiber gradually destroys the entanglement of the entangled polarized qubits .",
    "the entanglement of the time - bin entangled qubits also suffers of severe decoherence in optical fiber due to the chromatic dispersion effect .",
    "however , when the spatial qubits are used for sending information thought optical fibers , both depolarization and chromatic dispersion does not affect , directly , their quantum correlations and thus the entanglement of the spatial qubits seems to be more robust against the decoherence effects of optical fibers .",
