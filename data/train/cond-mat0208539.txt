    "the single impurity kondo or @xmath0@xmath1 model ( sikm ) @xcite @xmath2 is , together with its close relative , the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xcite , one of the fundamental models in the theory of correlated electron systems .",
    "it has been studied extensively over the past four decades @xcite , but despite its simplicity , no complete analytic solution exists that provides information on both thermodynamic and dynamical quantities . for example , the bethe ansatz solution @xcite has solved all universal properties of the kondo problem including its high to low  temperature crossover behavior . but",
    "the bethe ansatz requires the limit of infinite conduction band width and can not be used to calculate dynamical quantities beyond the low  energy limit .",
    "thus , numerical methods , like wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite or quantum monte  carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , in connection with maximum  entropy methods @xcite have to be employed to access dynamical quantities on all energy scales . in both methods , evaluation of dynamical properties , and quantities related to them , like the korringa  shiba relation or the friedel sum rule @xcite ,",
    "suffer from unavoidable numerical errors .",
    "qmc simulations , in addition , can not be used at zero temperature and are restricted to comparatively large values of @xmath3.@xcite moreover , a reliable evaluation of single and two  particle spectra and related quantities in an external magnetic field , as well as their comparison and interpretation within a local fermi liquid picture @xcite become rather problematic @xcite , especially in the limit of vanishing external magnetic field .",
    "approximate analytical techniques , like perturbation expansions or @xmath4expansions @xcite , typically only describe certain properties of the kondo model correctly .",
    "a notable exception in this respect is the so  called local moment approach ( lma ) @xcite .",
    "this perturbative approach is very accurate in most cases @xcite , including those of nonvanishing external magnetic fields.@xcite    besides its relevance for the study of moment formation in metals , the sikm ( [ equ : sikm ] ) has gained new importance as input for investigating non  dilute correlated electron systems like heavy fermion materials within dynamical mean  field theory ( dmft).@xcite here a reliable method for calculating single ",
    "particle correlation functions , especially close to the fermi energy , is extremely important .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new _ non  perturbative _ semi  analytical approach to the kondo problem based on wegner s flow equation method @xcite and previous work on applications of flow equations to strong  coupling problems @xcite .",
    "we will show that to a very good approximation , many physical quantities of the kondo model can be calculated from a resonant level model ( rlm ) , where the interacting features of the kondo model are encoded in a non  constant _ effective hybridization function _ of this resonant level model .",
    "surprisingly , this noninteracting effective model describes both universal low ",
    "energy properties like the wilson ratio as well as high  energy power laws and logarithmic corrections with very good accuracy . due to the noninteracting nature of this effective model this",
    "mapping allows immediate insights into the physics of the sikm , for example the dependence of its static and dynamical quantities on a local magnetic field .    after presenting our approach in the next section",
    ", we will discuss several static quantities at @xmath5 as a function of a local magnetic field and derive analytical expressions for their asymptotic behavior .",
    "as an example for a dynamical quantity , we will then discuss the spin  structure factor and the korringa ",
    "shiba relation .",
    "an outlook on potential future applications of our approach concludes this paper .",
    "the general framework of the flow equation method@xcite and its application to the kondo model has been explained in detail in ref .  .",
    "here we will only repeat the main steps in order to make this paper self  contained , and refer to ref .   for more details .",

    "one can set up a framework that diagonalizes a many  particle hamiltonian @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 becomes diagonal .",
    "the concrete realization of this approach for the kondo model was discussed in ref .  .",
    "the starting point is the bosonized form@xcite of the hamiltonian  ( [ equ : sikm ] ) . since we will be mainly interested in describing the basic ideas of our approach , we restrict ourselves to a linear dispersion relation .",
    "notice , however , that the flow equation approach can also be used for a nontrivial conduction band density of states as it does not rely on the integrability of the model.@xcite with a linear dispersion relation the kondo problem becomes effectively one  dimensional , the charge density excitations in ( [ equ : sikm ] ) decouple , and we only need to look at the spin density part @xmath12 with @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 are the bosonic spin density modes with the bosonic spin density field defined by @xmath15 . for simplicity we have set the fermi velocity @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17  is proportional to the inverse conduction band width .",
    "all our latter results will be expressed as universal functions of the low ",

    "( [ bosonic_kondo ] ) was used as the starting point @xmath10 of the flow equation approach in ref .  .",
    "away from the toulouse point the unitary equivalence of the flow holds only approximately , but this approximation can be controlled by a small parameter@xcite and yields very accurate results . during the flow the hamiltonian can be parameterized as @xmath20 \\ .",

    "for the special case @xmath27 they fulfill fermionic anticommutation relations @xmath28 and can therefore be interpreted as creation and annihilation operators for fermions .    in ref .   the following flow equations for the parameters in ( [ h(b ) ] )",

    "we will use an improved version of the above flow equations by taking into account that all approximations should be performed with respect to the interacting ground state : it turns out that the only necessary modification in ( [ feq_1 ] ) , ( [ feq_2 ] ) and ( [ feq_3 ] ) is that the exponent in @xmath32 gets replaced by @xmath33 , i.e.  it is not a running exponent anymore.@xcite      now we will compare this system of differential equations with the flow equations for a resonant level model ( rlm ) .",
    "this will lead to the _ key result _ of this paper : the rlm can be used as an _ effective model _ for the complicated strong  coupling kondo model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the resonant level model is given by @xmath34 following the same flow equation approach as previously in the sikm , we establish a solution to the rlm ( [ equ : siam ] ) .",
    "a detailed description of the flow equation solution can be found in ref .  .",
    "one finds the following flow equations for the parameters in ( [ equ : rml ] ) @xmath35    it should be noted that this yields the exact analytical solution . having established the flow equations to solve both the sikm and the rlm , respectively , one can now show an approximate equivalence of these two models .",
    "we introduce the substitution @xmath36 and notice that with this substitution the two set of flow equations ( [ feq_1],[feq_2 ] ) and ( [ feq_a1][feq_a3 ] ) become equivalent for @xmath37 in the rlm , with the exception of the logarithmic term in ( [ feq_1 ] ) .",
    "thus we now have established an approximate mapping of the sikm onto the rlm by means of ( [ subst ] ) in the sense that their flow equation diagonalization is identical .",
    "we shall refer to this relation by introducing the _ effective hybridization function _ @xmath38 : the rlm with this non  trivial hybridization function can be used as an effective model for the sikm in the kondo limit ( small coupling limit ) @xmath39 . since this noninteracting rlm is a simple , quadratic hamiltonian , this mapping will allow us to read off and understand many properties of the complicated many  body kondo physics in an intuitive and straightforward way .",
    "_ it will turn out that the deviations of @xmath40 from a constant hybridization function encode the quasiparticle interaction and therefore the many ",
    "body kondo physics in this quadratic effective hamiltonian .",
    "_    notice that the above mapping between the sikm and the rlm becomes _ exact _ at the toulouse point @xcite @xmath41 since @xmath42 for all flow parameters  @xmath9 .",
    "one easily verifies that the effective rlm then has a constant hybridization function , @xmath43 . in this case",
    ", our mapping just reduces to the observation already made by toulouse that the partition function of the kondo model for this specific coupling constant  @xmath3 is exactly equivalent to the partition function of a quadratic hamiltonian.@xcite    in order to specify the function @xmath40 in the kondo limit it is best to not directly use relation ( [ subst ] ) , but to determine the effective hybridization function from matching a correlation function in the sikm and the rlm .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath44correlation function , evaluated it with respect to ( [ h(b ) ] ) for @xmath45 , and then chose @xmath40 in the rlm such that this coincided with the @xmath46correlation function .",
    "the resulting @xmath40 agrees with ( [ subst ] ) in the high and low  energy regimes , with deviations only in the crossover region .",
    "however , the mapping from the kondo model to the effective rlm becomes better since this procedure manages to partly also take the logarithmic term in ( [ feq_1 ] ) into account .",
    "the resulting effective hybridization function can be scaled into a dimensionless form with one dimensionful parameter @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 is a universal function in the kondo limit ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for @xmath50 , and coincides with its universal form for @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , i.e. this should be sufficient for most practical purposes@xcite ) . for larger energies",

    ".result of the fit ( [ equ : fit ] ) to the effective hybridization @xmath49.[tab : fit ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a similar analysis based on the comparison of flow equations shows that the above mapping between the sikm and the noninteracting rlm can be extended to the case of a kondo hamiltonian ( [ equ : sikm ] ) with a nonvanishing local magnetic field  @xmath57 @xmath58 by setting @xmath59 in the rlm",
    ". however , the mapping with the above effective hybridization function becomes less accurate for @xmath60 due to the approximate nature of the flow equation solution ( [ feq_1][feq_3 ] ) .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail below .",
    "summing up , as long as we are interested in static quantities in a local magnetic field smaller than approximately  @xmath18 and/or dynamical correlation functions for energies smaller than approximately  @xmath61 , we can use the rlm with the effective hybridization function ( [ equ : fit ] ) to describe the physics of the sikm in the small coupling limit .",
    "the only undetermined parameter in the rlm is the energy scale @xmath62 that explicitly depends on  @xmath3 .",
    "this overall energy scale is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "notice that the non  perturbative behavior of this energy scale @xmath63 follows correctly from the original flow equations ( [ feq_1][feq_3 ] ) , compare ref .  .",
    "once the mapping between the sikm ( [ equ : sikm ] ) and the effective rlm ( [ equ : siam ] ) has been established , one can readily calculate physical quantities for the kondo model .",
    "one complication arises from the fact that operators of the original sikm have to be transformed by a unitary transformation analogous to ( [ floweq_1 ] ) . in the language of the effective resonant level model they will thus in general correspond to more complicated many ",
    "particle operators .",
    "since the intention of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of our mapping in a pedagogical setting , we will concentrate on two quantities that remain simple under these transformations : i )  the @xmath64-component of the spin operator @xmath65 , which becomes @xmath66 , and ii )  the hamiltonian itself .    from the latter we obtain the internal energy @xmath67 and the sommerfeld coefficient , @xmath68 . a straightforward calculation in the noninteracting rlm yields @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the derivative of @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the principal value integral .",
    "here @xmath73 is the impurity orbital density of states of the rlm @xmath74    the result ( [ equ : gamma ] ) for @xmath75 has some interesting implications .",
    "first , because @xmath76 is connected to @xmath77 , it is apparent that the low  energy excitations in the system are controlled by spin degrees of freedom , a well  known feature of the kondo physics .",
    "however , in our approach this result can be read off directly from equ .",
    "( [ equ : gamma ] ) .",
    "second , @xmath78 , i.e.  we obtain the correct scaling behavior for @xmath75 _ directly _ from the behavior of @xmath40 .",
    "there is , however , a nontrivial correction coming from the factor in parenthesis in ( [ equ : gamma ] ) . note that for @xmath79const .",
    "this correction is one , but for the strongly @xmath80dependent @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] it is of the order of two . as we will demonstrate later , this difference is directly responsible for obtaining the correct wilson ratio in our approach .    from the mapping @xmath66 it is easy to calculate @xmath81 .",
    "since the correlation function has to be evaluated within the rlm , one obtains for the imaginary part at @xmath5 @xmath82 again , this result provides direct access to an interpretation of the behavior of @xmath83 in terms of the physics of the resonant level model .",
    "one quantity that can be calculated analytically is the low  energy limit of the spin structure factor @xmath84 , @xmath85 for a vanishing local magnetic field @xmath86 is just the spin relaxation rate accessible in e.g.  spin resonance experiments . with the result for @xmath87 from ( [ equ : chipp ] ) we obtain @xmath88 which leads to the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figt1 ] .",
    "( [ equ : toneinv ] ) is of particular importance because it explicitly demonstrates universality , @xmath89 , and allows to directly fit e.g.  experimental data from esr or nmr experiments and extract the kondo     as function of the local magnetic field @xmath57.[fig : figt1],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    temperature .",
    "note furthermore that the result ( [ equ : toneinv ] ) is not only valid in the kondo limit , but also holds at the toulouse point of the anisotropic kondo model and everywhere in between .",
    "since it does not depend on the details of @xmath40 it will also be true for general band structures @xmath90 in ( [ equ : sikm ] ) and thus is eventually _ the _ result for @xmath86 in dmft calculations .",
    "the full frequency dependent @xmath87 has to be calculated numerically using the form of the effective hybridization function in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . the results for three values of the external field , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93     for three characteristic local magnetic fields @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . [ fig : chipp],scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : chipp ] .",
    "these correlation functions provide a good example for the usefulness of our mapping to the effective rlm since one can directly interpret the structures and their frequency and field dependencies in terms of analytical formulas derived for the rlm .",
    "e.g.  the high  frequency behavior of @xmath87 follows directly from equ .",
    "( [ equ : chipp ] ) and the behavior of the effective hybridization function @xmath40 at large energies ( which is linear with logarithmic corrections , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) : @xmath87 decays like @xmath94 with logarithmic corrections , in agreement with ( expensive ) numerical results @xcite .    for the dependence of the dynamical susceptibility on the local magnetic field",
    "one makes use of the fact that the local magnetic field corresponds to the on  site energy in the effective rml .",
    "therefore it is obvious that the observed shift of the resonance peak in @xmath87 is due to the shifted center of the resonant level .",
    "furthermore , the depletion of the maximum value is related to the decreasing occupation of the resonant level , which corresponds directly to the _ increasing _ local magnetization in the sikm . at the same time",
    ", one observes a decrease of the total spectral weight in @xmath87 , which can be accounted for by a transfer to a finite expectation value of @xmath95 in the sikm .",
    "there is , however , also a non  trivial effect , namely the increasing broadening of the resonance peak with increasing magnetic field . for a rlm with a constant @xmath40 such a behavior does not occur",
    "; it is entirely related to the fact that with increasing magnetic field the system starts to notice the energy dependence of the effective hybridization .",
    "the quantity not yet fixed in our calculation is @xmath18 , or more precisely the proportionality constant in @xmath96 .",
    "this can most conveniently be done by using wilson s definition of the kondo temperature@xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the static magnetic susceptibility and @xmath99 the wilson number .",
    "@xmath98 can be obtained from the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility ( [ equ : chipp ] ) via @xmath100 and must in general be evaluated numerically . at the toulouse point",
    "one can , however , give an analytic answer since @xmath101 and thus @xmath102 therefore at the toulouse point the korringa ",
    "shiba relation@xcite @xmath103 is independent of the local magnetic field @xmath104    in the following we will discuss @xmath105 and the korringa ",
    "shiba relation for the kondo limit @xmath106 .",
    "the quantity @xmath105 is particularly convenient for a comparison with nrg results .     from equ .",
    "( [ equ : chi ] ) ( circles ) and the same quantity obtained from an nrg calculation.[fig : fig2],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the circles represent the values of @xmath105 calculated via ( [ equ : chi ] ) with the effective hybridization function from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , and the full line represents the result of an nrg calculation .",
    "we observe excellent agreement for all values of the local magnetic field : notice that the curves agree without fit parameters .",
    "this example clearly demonstrates that the nontrivial form of the effective hybridization in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] encodes the many  particle physics of the sikm in a trivial noninteracting effective model .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] can readily be combined with relations ( [ equ : gamma ] ) and ( [ equ : toneinv ] ) to obtain the wilson ratio@xcite @xmath107 our results for the wilson ratio and the korringa  shiba relation obtained within the effective rlm are collected in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . for the wilson ratio we would actually have to calculate the quantity @xmath108 and",
    "not @xmath98.@xcite however , for the case of small @xmath109 considered here , both quantities are equivalent.@xcite one observes that both @xmath110 and @xmath111 are independent of the local magnetic field up to approximately @xmath112 , and then start to     ( full line ) and the wilson ratio @xmath110 ( dashed line ) as a function of a local magnetic field . the correct limiting values at @xmath113 are missed by approximately 5% .",
    "[ fig : fig3],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    decrease ( shiba ratio ) , respectively increase ( wilson ratio ) .",
    "the exact bethe ansatz solution @xcite gives @xmath114 independent of the magnetic field strength ( see also ref .  ) , and local fermi liquid theory yields @xmath115 for @xmath116.@xcite our limiting values as @xmath113 miss these exact results by approximately 5% .",
    "notice that the term @xmath117 in ( [ equ : gamma ] ) is very important to obtain this correct value for @xmath118 .",
    "remarkably , our simple _ noninteracting _ effective model therefore correctly describes the wilson ratio in the kondo limit ( for not too large magnetic fields ) , which is a hallmark of strong  coupling kondo physics .",
    "let us finally analyze the accuracy of our effective model . since fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] demonstrates that integral quantities like @xmath105 are obtained with very good accuracy for _ all _ magnetic fields , one can infer from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] that quantities depending on low  energy details in frequency space like @xmath75 and @xmath86 are more susceptible to our approximations for increasing magnetic fields .",
    "this suggests that for such low  energy quantities our effective model can be employed with very good accuracy ( 5%  error ) for magnetic fields below @xmath18 , and with good accuracy ( 20%  error ) still up to approximately  @xmath119 .",
    "summing up , we have shown that the resonant level model with a nontrivial hybridization function @xmath40 can be used as an effective model for the single impurity kondo model .",
    "the key observation was the fact that the flow equation solutions of both models are approximately identical if a suitable @xmath40 is chosen for the rlm ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in this mapping the impurity orbital occupation number @xmath120 plays the role of the kondo impurity spin @xmath65 .",
    "the impurity orbital energy corresponds to the local magnetic field acting on  @xmath65 .",
    "in contrast with the conventional approach where effective models describe the vicinity of the low  energy renormalization group fixed points@xcite , our effective model very accurately describes _",
    "both certain low and high  energy properties of the original kondo model _ : compare for example our discussion of the dynamical spin  spin correlation function in fig .",
    "[ fig : chipp ] .",
    "it also yields thermodynamic quantities that are in excellent agreement with much more expensive numerical methods ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the nontrivial behavior of the effective hybridization function encodes the quasiparticle interaction , which leads to e.g.  the correct wilson ratio for small magnetic fields ( with 5% accuracy ) .",
    "notice , however , that our effective model does not allow the correct evaluation of higher  order correlation functions beyond the low  energy limit ,    in conclusion , our approach describes many aspects of the complicated many  body kondo physics for not too large magnetic fields within a simple noninteracting model",
    ". therefore one can very easily and intuitively understand certain properties of the kondo model , e.g. the dependence of correlation functions on a local magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chipp ] ) .",
    "one main prospect of our approach is to look at other correlation functions using this effective model , in particular the @xmath121matrix for applications in the framework of dmft calculations .",
