    "recent observations of high redshift type ia supernovae reveal that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion rather than decelerated expansion @xcite . meanwhile , the discovery of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy on degree scales together with the galaxy redshift surveys indicate @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 .",
    "all these results strongly suggest that the universe is permeated smoothly by dark energy , which violates the strong energy condition with negative pressure and causes the expansion rate of the universe accelerating .",
    "the dark energy and accelerating universe have been discussed extensively from different points of view @xcite . in principle , a natural candidate for dark energy could be a small cosmological constant . however , there exist serious theoretical problems : fine tuning and coincidence problems .",
    "to overcome the coincidence problem , some self - interact scaler fields @xmath7 with an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath8 were introduced dubbed quintessence , where @xmath9 is time varying and negative .",
    "generally , the potentials of the scalar field should be determined from the underlying physical theory , such as supergravity , superstring / m - theory etc .. however , from the phenomenal level , one can also design many kinds of potentials to solve the concrete problems @xcite .",
    "once the potentials are given , eos @xmath9 of dark energy can be found . on the other hand ,",
    "the potential can also be reconstructed from a given eos @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "that is , the forms of the scalar potential can be determined from observational data .",
    "although there are many kinds of models for dark energy , one still knew little about it s properties .",
    "and , one also needs some mechanism to distinguish these different models .",
    "therefore , one may wish to use the model independent method to study the universe without specifying a particular model for dark energy .",
    "that is , we can use observational data to parameterize the eos of dark energy , and then to study the evolution of the universe directly .",
    "the idea that our world may have more than four dimensions is due to kaluza @xcite , who unified einstein s theory of general relativity with maxwell s theory of electromagnetism in a @xmath4 manifold . in 1926 , klein reconsidered kaluza s idea and treated the extra dimension as a compact small circle topologically @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the kaluza - klein idea has been studied extensively from different points of view . among them , a kind of theory called space - time - matter ( stm ) theory , is designed to incorporate the geometry and matter by wesson and his collaborators ( for review , please see @xcite and references therein ) . in stm theory ,",
    "our @xmath10 world is a hypersurface embedded in a @xmath4 ricci flat ( @xmath11 ) manifold , and all the matter in our @xmath10 world are induced from the extra dimension .",
    "this theory is supported by campbell s theorem @xcite which says that any analytical solution of einstein field equation of @xmath12 dimensions can be locally embedded in a ricci - flat manifold of @xmath13 dimensions .",
    "since the matter are induced from the extra dimension , this theory is also called induced matter theory .    within the framework of stm theory , a cosmological solution is presented in @xcite in which it was shown that the universe is characterized by having a big bounce instead of a big bang .",
    "it was also shown that both the radiation and matter dominated cosmological models could be recovered from the solution .",
    "further studies of this solution include the embedding to brane models @xcite , the isometry with @xmath4 black holes @xcite , the big bounce singularity @xcite , and the dark energy models @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the acceleration of the @xmath4 solution .",
    "the solution contains two arbitrary functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will show in section [ ii ] that one of these two arbitrary functions , @xmath0 , plays a similar role as the potential @xmath14 in quintessence or phantom dark energy models .",
    "this enable us to study the evolution of the @xmath4 universe in a model independent way .",
    "we will reconstruct the evolution of the @xmath4 universe by using four known parameterized methods .",
    "section [ iii ] is a short discussion .",
    "the @xmath4 cosmological solution was originally given by liu and mashhoon in 1995 @xcite .",
    "then , in 2001 , liu and wesson @xcite restudied the solution and showed that it describes a cosmological model with a big bounce as opposed to a big bang .",
    "the @xmath4 metric of this solution reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two arbitrary functions of @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the @xmath22 curvature index @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a constant .",
    "this solution satisfies the 5d vacuum equation @xmath11 .",
    "so , the three invariants are @xmath25 the invariant @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ 3-invar ] ) shows that @xmath24 determines the curvature of the 5d manifold .",
    "using the @xmath10 part of the @xmath4 metric ( [ 5-metric ] ) to calculate the @xmath10 einstein tensor , one obtains @xmath27 in ref .",
    "@xcite , the induced matter was set to contain three components : dark matter , radiation and @xmath28-matter . in this paper , we assume , for simplicity , the induced matter to contain two parts : cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xmath29 and dark energy ( de ) @xmath30 .",
    "so , we have @xmath31 where @xmath32 from eqs.([frw - eq ] ) and ( [ eos - x ] ) , one obtains the eos of the dark energy @xmath33 and the dimensionless density parameters @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the current density of cdm and scale factor at present time , respectively ( the subscript @xmath38 denotes value at present time ) , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are dimensionless density parameters of cdm and de , respectively .",
    "the hubble parameter and deceleration parameter should be given as @xcite , @xcite , @xmath41 from which we see that @xmath42 represents an accelerating universe , @xmath43 represents a decelerating universe .",
    "so the function @xmath0 plays a crucial role in defining the properties of the universe at late time . in this paper",
    ", we consider the spatially flat @xmath44 cosmological model . from equations ( [ wx])-([df ] )",
    ", it is easy to see that these equations do not contain the second arbitrary @xmath1 explicitly .",
    "so if we use the relation @xmath45 and define @xmath46 with @xmath47 , then these equations ( [ wx])-([df ] ) can be expressed in terms of redshift @xmath2 as @xmath48 note that in the @xmath4 bounce model the scale factor @xmath49 reaches a nonzero minimum at @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bouncing time . from eq .",
    "( [ a(z ) ] ) , this @xmath51 corresponds to a maximum redshift @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the relation ( [ a(z ) ] ) and all the equations after it only valid in the range @xmath53 ( i.e. , after the bounce ) .",
    "now let us consider equation ( [ wx-2 ] ) which is a first order ordinary differential equation of the function @xmath3 w.r.t .",
    "redshift @xmath2 .",
    "this equation could be integrated if the form of @xmath54 is given .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the scalar potentials can be constructed from a given eos of dark energy @xmath9 . following this spirit",
    ", we can also reconstruct the forms of function @xmath3 from a given concrete form of @xmath54 . and",
    "once the function @xmath3 is constructed , the evolution of the universe can be determined . at this point",
    ", we say that the cosmological models are reconstructed .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we consider the following four cases to reconstruct the forms of @xmath3 .    * case i : * @xmath55 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) for this case , @xmath56 is a constant and we find that eq .",
    "( [ wx-2 ] ) can be integrated , giving @xmath57 then using this @xmath3 in ( [ omega - cd-2 ] ) , ( [ omega - de-2 ] ) and ( [ q ] ) , we obtain @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath58 expressed in terms of @xmath2 alone .",
    "the evolutions of the dimensionless energy density parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , eos of dark energy @xmath59 , and the deceleration parameter @xmath60 are plotted in fig .",
    "( [ figz1 ] ) .",
    "* case ii : * @xmath61 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) for this case eq . ( [ wx-2 ] ) can also be integrated , giving @xmath62 using this @xmath3 in ( [ omega - cd-2 ] ) , ( [ omega - de-2 ] ) and ( [ q ] ) , we obtain the expressions of the evolutions of the dimensionless energy density parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , eos of dark energy @xmath59 , and the deceleration parameter @xmath60 , and we plot them in fig .",
    "( [ figz2 ] ) .",
    "* case iii : * @xmath63 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) similar as in case i and case ii , for this case we have @xmath64}.\\label{fz3}\\ ] ] we plot the evolutions of the dimensionless energy density parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , eos of dark energy @xmath59 and deceleration parameter @xmath60 in fig .",
    "( [ figz3 ] ) .",
    "* case iv : * @xmath65 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) for this case @xmath3 is also integrable and we find @xmath66}.\\label{fz4}\\ ] ] we plot the evolutions of the dimensionless energy density parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , eos of dark energy @xmath59 and deceleration parameter @xmath60 in fig .",
    "( [ figz4 ] ) .",
    "we see that in case i the eos of dark energy @xmath56 is assumed to be a constant @xmath67 during the whole evolution of the universe . in the other three cases ,",
    "@xmath56 deviates from @xmath67 in different ways as the redshift @xmath2 increases .",
    "this causes the density and deceleration parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath60 deviate from those in case i explicitly at higher redshift .",
    "it is expected that these deviations may become very large at very large redshift . in further studies we are going to use more observational dada such as those from the sne ia data to constrain the parameters in the expression of @xmath56 . here , in this paper , we just want to use above four cases to illustrate how to reconstruct function @xmath3 from a given eos of dark energy , and the results show that our procedure works .",
    "the @xmath4 cosmological solution presented by liu , mashhoon and wesson in @xcite and@xcite is rich in mathematics because it contains two arbitrary functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , this also brings us a problem : how to determine the two arbitrary functions . in this paper",
    "we find that one of the two functions , @xmath0 , plays a similar role as the potential @xmath68 in the quintessence and phantom dark energy models .",
    "meanwhile , another arbitrary function @xmath1 seems do not affect the densities and the eos of dark energy in an explicit way .",
    "this reminds us of a similar situation happened in the @xmath10 general relativity where one can study the cosmic evolution of dark energy ( as well as other densities ) just from a given parameterized eos of dark energy without knowing it s explicit form and without knowing the explicit form of the scale factor @xmath69 . following this kind of model independent methods",
    "we have used the relation ( [ a(z ) ] ) and successfully derived the differential equation ( [ wx-2 ] ) which governs the function @xmath3 . furthermore , for four known eos of dark energy , we have successfully integrated eq . ( [ wx-2 ] ) and",
    "plotted the evolutions of the density and deceleration parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath60 . in this sense , we say that we have reconstructed the @xmath4 solution .",
    "however , we should also say that this kind of reconstruction is not complete . as we mentioned in section [ ii ] that the relation @xmath70 in ( [ a(z ) ] )",
    "does not cover the whole @xmath4 manifold of the bounce solution ; it can only cover `` half '' of it , i.e. , that half after the bounce for @xmath53 .",
    "there is actually a one to two correspondence between @xmath49 and @xmath20 for the whole curve of @xmath49 in the bounce model ; while the relation @xmath70 is just a one to one correspondence between @xmath49 and @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "even if in the @xmath10 general relativity , the scale factor @xmath69 is not easy to be integrated out analytically if the cosmic matter contains more than one different components of matter . in our @xmath4 case , the scale factor @xmath71 might be more complicated than @xmath69 . to study the evolution of the whole bounce model , one may need look for other method such as the numerical simulation which beyond the scope of this paper .",
