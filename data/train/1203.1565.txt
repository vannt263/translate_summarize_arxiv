    "during the last decade the progress in single - molecule manipulation techniques such as atomic force spectroscopy ( afm ) and optical or magnetic tweezers @xcite has attracted the interest of researchers to a new field of fascinating phenomena like dna unzipping @xcite , or forced - induced detachment of individual polymers from adsorbing surfaces @xcite .",
    "one can experimentally test elastic and adhesive properties as well as bond scission in polymer fibers , or in fundamental biological objects like proteins , nucleic acids , or molecular motors with spatial resolution in the _ nm _ range and force resolution in the _ pn _ range . in this way",
    "substantial progress has been achieved in the understanding and use of fibers , adhesives or biopolymers .",
    "besides technological relevance , the field of single - chain manipulation poses also numerous questions of interest to fundamental physics .",
    "thus , it has been shown , for example , that the force - induced unzipping of the double - stranded dna is a @xmath10-st order phase transition @xcite that has the same nature as the force - induced desorption transition of a polymer from an adhesive substrate @xcite and that both phenomena can be described by the same kind of _ re - entrant _ phase diagram .",
    "while the theoretical understanding of these phase transformations in terms of equilibrium statistical thermodynamics has meanwhile significantly improved @xcite , their kinetics has been so far less well explored .",
    "originally , a theoretical treatment of the problem was suggested by sebastian  @xcite while the first computer simulations of the related phenomenon of dna force - induced unzipping were reported by marenduzzo _",
    "et al . _",
    "yet a number of basic questions pertaining to the dependence of the total mean detachment time @xmath2 on polymer length @xmath3 , pulling force @xmath11 , or adhesion strength , @xmath12 , remain open or need validation .",
    "so far we are not aware of computer simulational studies which would shed light on these problems .",
    "therefore , in order to fill the gap regarding force - induced desorption kinetics , we consider in this work a generic problem : the force - induced detachment dynamics of a single chain , placed on adhesive structureless plane .",
    "the theoretical method which we used is different and more general then in ref .",
    "@xcite where a phantom ( gaussian ) chain was treated in terms of the corresponding rouse equation . instead",
    ", our consideration : ( i ) takes into account all excluded - volume interactions among monomers and , ( ii ) is based on the tensile - blob picture , proposed many years ago by brochard - wyart @xcite as theoretical framework for the description of a steady - state driven macromolecule in solutions .",
    "this approach was generalized recently by sakaue @xcite for the analysis of non - equilibrium transient regimes in polymer translocations through a narrow pore .",
    "very recently , sebastian _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated ( within the tensile blob picture ) that the average position @xmath13 of a monomer @xmath14 at time @xmath15 is governed by the so - called @xmath16-laplacian nonlinear diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper we discuss force - induced desorption kinetics on the basis of a nonlinear diffusion equation which governs the time - dependent density distribution @xmath17 of monomers .",
    "we show that this equation is similar to the _ porous medium equation _ ( pme )",
    "@xcite which has gained widespread acceptance in the theory of groundwater transport through geological strata @xcite .",
    "the most natural way of solving the pme is based on _ self - similarity _ which implies that the governing equation is invariant under the proper space and time transformation @xcite .",
    "thus , self - similarity reduces the problem to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation which can be solved much more easily .    eventually , in order to check our predictions we performed extensive md- and mc - simulations which , for the case of strong adsorption , large pulling forces and overdamped regime , show an excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions .",
    "moreover , the comparison of mc and md data reveals that the presence of inertial effects , typical in underdamped dynamics , significantly affects the observed detachment kinetics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after this short introduction , in section  [ sec_theory ] we present briefly the theoretical treatment of the problem and emphasize the different regimes pertinent to polymer detachment kinetics .",
    "a short description of the simulational mc- and md models is given in section  [ sec_model ] while in section  [ sec_simul ] we discuss the main results provided by our computer experiments .",
    "in section  [ sec_exper ] we suggest a plausible experiment which could validate our theoretical results .",
    "we end this work by a brief summary of our findings in section  [ sec_summary ] .",
    "after equilibration on an attractive solid substrate , the adsorbed polymer chain can be pictured as a two dimensional string of _ adsorption blobs _ of size @xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the kuhn segment length , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the flory exponent and the crossover ( or , adsorption ) exponent .",
    "the dimensionless adsorption energy @xmath22 ( here and in what follows @xmath23 denotes the boltzmann constant , and @xmath24 is temperature ) , whereas @xmath25 is the critical adsorption point ( cap ) .",
    "the external driving force @xmath11 acts on the free chain end ( in the @xmath26-direction ) while the second chain end is tethered to the substrate .",
    "if the pulling force strength falls in the range @xmath27 , the chain tail forms a kind of `` trumpet '' shape , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "moreover , as far as the adsorption blob , adjacent to `` trumpet '' , changes its lateral position ( i.e. , its coordinates within the substrate ) during desorption , the `` trumpet '' has not only vertical velocity ( in the @xmath26-direction ) but also a lateral one .",
    "the latter leads to a tilt of the `` trumpet '' axis in direction opposite to the lateral velocity due to stokes friction .",
    "the tilting angle is denoted by @xmath28 in fig .  [ blob ] and , as will be seen from our simulation results in sec .",
    "[ sec_simul ] , almost does not change in the course of detachment .",

    "our consideration is based on the assumption that the lateral component of the tensile force is very weak ( because the trumpet is almost vertical ) , so that any force propagation along the adsorbed part of chain can be neglected .",
    "this is different from the case considered by serr and netz @xcite where the pulling of a strongly adsorbed chain by means of an afm has been investigated .",
    "in contrast to the present case where an uniform field pulls on the first bead , the afm cantilever can move vertically and horizontally with respect to substrate so that the tilt angle @xmath28 changes with time . moreover , in this case the sliding of the polymer on the substrate becomes important with the polymer - surface friction force being much larger than the stokes friction force for the detached part which is essential in our case .",

    "<S> the force - assisted desorption kinetics of a macromolecule from adhesive surface is studied theoretically , using the notion of tensile ( pincus ) blobs , as well as by means of monte - carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the change of detached monomers with time is governed by a differential equation which is equivalent to the nonlinear porous medium equation ( pme ) , employed widely in transport modeling of hydrogeological systems . depending on the pulling force and the strength of adsorption </S>",
    "<S> , three kinetic regimes can be distinguished : ( i ) `` trumpet '' ( weak adsorption and small pulling force ) , ( ii ) `` stem - trumpet '' ( weak adsorption and moderate force ) , and ( iii ) `` stem '' ( strong adsorption and large force ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in all regimes the number of desorbed beads @xmath0 , and the height of the first monomer ( which experiences a pulling force ) @xmath1 above the surface follow an universal square - root - of - time law . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the total time of detachment @xmath2 , scales with polymer length @xmath3 as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our main theoretical conclusions are tested and found in agreement with data from extensive mc- and md - simulations .    </S>",
