    "quantum monte carlo simulation , an undeniably useful tool in addressing a number of issues in quantum many - body physics , can not be used to simulate real - time dynamics . by means of analytic continuation to euclidean time @xmath3 ( @xmath5 ) , however , the schrdinger equation turns into a diffusion equation , which can be simulated using random walks which explore the potential landscape by spending proportionately more `` time '' near the valleys of the potential and less `` time '' near the potential heights .",
    "the same transformation into imaginary time turns the path integral representation of the evolution operator from an integral over paths of computationally `` nasty '' phase factors , a problem almost impossible to treat stochastically , into an integral over paths in imaginary time weighted by a real and positive `` boltzmann - like '' weight ; this weight is interpreted as a well - behaved probability for a particular path to contribute to the sum and this interpretation allows a straightforward stochastic treatment@xcite .",
    "this transformation , by itself , is useful because it yields the interacting ground state and physical quantities related to the equilibrium statistical mechanical description of a quantum many - body system .",
    "however , if we are interested in obtaining information about the real - time dynamics and information about the excitations of the system , an `` inversion '' of this ill - defined transformation for the results of correlation functions @xmath0 of an operator @xmath6 representing a physical observable , namely , @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the imaginary - time ordering operator ) from the imaginary time @xmath3 back to real time @xmath9 is required .",
    "the analytic continuation to real - time proceeds by means of a `` numerical inversion '' of the qmc data on @xmath0 to find the spectral function @xmath2 .",
    "these inversion techniques , such as the so - called maximum entropy method@xcite or its generalization , the so - called stochastic analytical inference ( sai ) method@xcite , require very accurate qmc data on @xmath0 .",
    "since collective phenomena emerge at energy scales significantly smaller than the typical short - range interaction energy scale , we are mainly interested in sampling the long imaginary part of such response or correlation functions .",
    "such response functions obtained by qmc are noisy data and in a limited @xmath3 range .",
    "if we are interested in extracting the low energy excitations , this information hides more clearly in the long - imaginary - time evolution of the correlation functions which is typically obscured by statistical errors .",
    "flat histogram methods have been very useful in classical systems@xcite to overcome problems in simulations of first order phase transitions , systems with rough energy landscapes , etc .",
    "the flat histogram idea has been extended in quantum many - body systems and , in particular , in stochastic series expansion@xcite to overcome the tunneling problem in first order phase transitions , in the continuous - time quantum monte carlo approach to the impurity solver problem used in dynamical mean - field - theory dmft@xcite and the diagrammatic monte carlo method@xcite .    the main idea presented in this paper , in simple terms ,",
    "is the following .",
    "we show that the flat - histogram method can be applied to the qmc method itself to make the histogram of @xmath0 flat for all @xmath3 by sampling the variable @xmath3 , and keeping track of the factors in each imaginary - time interval needed to achieve this result . in this way",
    ", we are able to compute @xmath0 in a greater @xmath3 range with significantly smaller stochastic error .",
    "this approach allows us to achieve greater degree of accuracy when inverting the information contained in @xmath0 to find its corresponding spectral function @xmath2 in the entire range of values of @xmath10 of our interest .    in order to demonstrate the idea in the present paper , we need to make specific choices of i ) a non - trivial quantum many - body problem , ii ) a specific qmc method , iii ) a specific correlation function @xmath0 , and iv ) a method to carry out the analytic continuation . using the same methods and techniques we will calculate the spectral function @xmath2 using qmc with and without the application of the flat histogram method during the qmc runs which produce the data on @xmath0 .",
    "we will show that the flat histogram qmc method is superior to a simple qmc approach in which no flat histogram ideas have been implemented for such important observables . using our past specific experience with models and qmc techniques ,",
    "we choose the problem of the green s function @xmath11 of a single hole in the @xmath4 model@xcite with the diagrammatic monte carlo ( dmc ) method@xcite using the method of the stochastic analytical inference@xcite for the analytic continuation to obtain the spectral function @xmath12 from the qmc data obtained for @xmath11 .",
    "we apply the flat histogram idea with the combination of the dmc method and the wang - landau method , which we will refer to as the flat histogram diagrammatic monte carlo ( fhdmc ) method@xcite .",
    "we will also use the standard implementation of the dmc@xcite where a guidance function is used when sampling @xmath11 . in the latter case , as we will see , the use of a parameter @xmath13 effectively makes the histogram of @xmath11 flat . on the other hand , we will also carry out dmc simulations using @xmath14 without the application of the flat histogram idea , which we will refer to as dmc0 which yields a histogram of @xmath11 very far from being flat , and we compare these results with those obtained with above two qmc methods , i.e. , with standard - dmc and fhdmc . this comparison is made in order to show the main point of our paper that if the flat histogram idea is incorporated in any qmc method , it will provide a more accurate analytic continuation to real time .",

    ", we have shown that we can apply the flat histogram technique on the so - called diagrammatic monte carlo method@xcite to make the histogram @xmath28 of @xmath11 flat .",
    "the idea was demonstrated on the frhlich polaron problem .",
    "the results of the flat histogram dmc ( fhdmc ) on the estimate for the polaron ground state were significantly better than the result of the dmc0 .",
    "however , as argued in the paper@xcite the polaron problem spectrum was characterized by a gap , and the full advantage of the flat histogram method over dmc0 could not fully demonstrated .    in the present paper",
    "we use a simplified version of the @xmath4 model , in which the heisenberg and the hole - hopping terms are linearized within the spin - wave approximation to obtain a polaron - like hamiltonian@xcite , i.e. , @xmath29 where the operator @xmath30 is the bogoliubov spin - wave creation operator , @xmath31 is the spin - wave dispersion of the square lattice quantum antiferromagnet@xcite and @xmath16 is the hole creation operator . here",
    "@xmath32 is the coupling of the hole to spin waves and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the coefficients of the the bogoliubov transformation as given in ref .",
    "the single - hole spectral function of the above hamiltonian can be approximated by the non - crossing approximation(nca)@xcite .",
    "the diagrammatic monte carlo ( dmc ) method with or without@xcite the incorporation of the flat histogram technique can be applied to the problem of a single - hole . in this paper in order to demonstrate the method , we wish to restrict our dmc to the sampling of only the diagrams contributing to the nca .",
    "this restriction is actually a more difficult approach to numerically implement than the one in which the markov process samples all the connected diagrams contributing to @xmath11 .",
    "the reason for restricting ourselves within the nca diagrammatic space , is because in this case there is an `` exact '' solution to the problem which we can use to measure the success of the approach discussed here . in order to obtain the `` exact '' solution ,",
    "we have recalculated the single - hole green s function within the nca approach described in ref .   for @xmath35 for a @xmath36 size square lattice and a finite imaginary part",
    "was used in the free - hole propagator with @xmath37 ( in units of the hopping parameter @xmath9 ) which smears the lowest energy quasiparticle peak . note that as discussed in ref .   on this size lattice",
    "the finite - size effects were found to be small .",
    "the results of these calculations will be used as default models and we will refer to them as `` exact '' solutions .",
    "we have applied the dmc0 , the standard dmc , and fhdmc methods to obtain @xmath11 for @xmath35 and @xmath38 in the nca restricted diagrammatic space .",
    "we have carried out qmc simulations for a range of @xmath39 to compare with the exact results in order to make sure that our computer programs are correct .",

    "[ details ] . in the process of the analytic continuation",
    "we will analyze the qmc data obtained with the three different qmc methods which we discussed above .",
    "namely , first we will use dmc0 approach in which no guidance function has been implemented ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "second , we will use data obtained by means of standard - dmc ( sdmc ) where the histogram of @xmath49 is made approximately flat by multiplying @xmath49 with an exponential `` guidance '' function ( we use the same terminology used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the form @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) we compare the histograms of @xmath49 obtained with both dmc0 and standard - dmc .",
    "it is clear that the standard dmc makes the histogram of @xmath49 approximately flat .",

    "last , we will also use data obtained by the fhdmc .",
    "notice that the histogram of @xmath49 which we obtain using the wang - landau algorithm is flat to better than @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , we will use three different default models in each of the above cases , i.e. , the total number of results presented will correspond to nine combinations of qmc data and default models . in one series of results presented in this paper , we will use as default model the `` exact '' solution to the problem . as a second choice for default model we will use a flat distribution , and as a third choice we will use a default model which shares some aspects of the `` exact '' solution but it differs significantly from the `` exact '' solution and we call it the `` incorrect '' default model .",
    "these three choices are discussed in sec .",
    "[ defaults ] in detail .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , we will restrict our dmc approach to sample the diagrammatic subspace spanned only by the diagrams included in the non - crossing approximation@xcite .",
    "the only reason for this restriction is that the problem of the single - hole spectral function can be solved `` exactly '' ( `` exact '' with the limitations discussed in the previous section ) and , this , can be used to test the accuracy of the results of qmc method .",
    "furthermore , we will work with three sets of qmc data obtained for the histogram of @xmath11 for @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "one set is obtained with dmc0 , the second set is obtained with standard dmc , and the third set is obtained with fhdmc ; all three sets of data are obtained with approximately the same amount of cpu time in order to compare .",
    "the first set of data for the histogram of @xmath11 is obtained for @xmath52 ( in units of the inverse hopping matrix element @xmath9 ) while the other two sets of data are obtained for @xmath53 and in all three sets of data we have used 600 @xmath3-intervals ( @xmath54 ) and the number of data bins @xmath55 for each time - interval . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) we show that the histogram of @xmath49 obtained by the standard dmc is fairly flat over a very wide range of @xmath3 while that of the dmc0 is approximately an exponentially increasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we will consider that the standard dmc method is a method which produces an approximately flat histogram .",
    "0.4 in    0.2 in    0.2 in    the relative statistical error of the fhdmc results is more - or - less independent of @xmath3 ( see also fig .  [ fig:1](b ) ) and it was approximately @xmath56 while for the results obtained using standard - dmc , @xmath57 ranges from @xmath58 for small @xmath3 up to @xmath59 for large @xmath3 . the relative error for the dmc0 results is significantly larger and of the order of @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) ) .",
    "these relative errors were obtained by using approximately the same amount of cpu time such that the comparison between the three dmc methods to be meaningful .      since our data on @xmath11 obtained by either dmc0 , standard",

    ". this could be somewhat similar with a practical case scenario , where , for example , let us assume that we have performed a gw density - functional - theory based calculation for the quasiparticle spectral function of a real material , and , we have obtained more - or - less correct energy eigenvalues , but the quasiparticle wavefunctions are not close to the correct ones . in this case",
    "the peaks will be close to the correct positions but the spectral weights should be different from the actual ones . in principle",

    "this is within the flexibility of the dmc method , because we can select the set of feynman diagrams to sample .",
    "thus , by selecting the diagrammatic series to be the one which takes into account all the diagrams which contribute to the single - hole spectral function of the 2d @xmath4 model within the nca approximation , we can compare the results of the analytic continuation directly to the `` exact '' solution@xcite . to carry out the analytic continuation to real time",

    "the error on the short - time behavior of @xmath49 is significantly smaller in the case of standard dmc . *",
    "the error on the long - time behavior of @xmath49 is smaller in the case of fhdmc .",
    "this allows us to obtain somewhat better quality data on the spectrum and spectral weight of the very low - energy excitations .",
    "this aspect of the fhdmc method seems to give some advantage over the standard dmc , when we are interested in the very low - energy excitations of a given system .",
    "\\iii ) lastly , we exploit the fact that we know the `` exact '' solution to this problem to draw the following additional conclusions from the present calculations :    * when we use as default model , a distribution which is close to the exact , the result of the analytic continuation is very close to the exact result . *",
    "if the correct answer is completely unknown and we use as default model the flat distribution , the result for the location for and the residue of the lowest energy quasiparticle peak is very close to the exact value , and the location and width of the second lowest peak is also in agreement with the `` exact '' answer .",
    "the details of the spectral function can not be correctly captured by the analytic continuation using a flat default model .",
    "* if we approximately know some aspects of the solution , i.e. , we use a default model which shares some features of the correct solution ( such as the location of some of the peaks , but not their relative strength in the spectral function ) the analytic continuation tends to correct the strength of the peaks and tends to move the incorrectly located peaks of the default model towards the correct positions .",
    "the main point of the present paper is that , in general , if we incorporate the flat histogram idea with any qmc technique , in such a way to make the histogram of @xmath49 flat , the results of the analytic continuation to real time should be of better statistical quality .    0.2 in",
