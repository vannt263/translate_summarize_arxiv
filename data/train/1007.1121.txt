    "in high - energy hadronic collisions , a large fraction of the events is produced diffractively and contains one or more leading ( anti-)protons or excited hadronic states @xmath0 with relatively low mass @xmath1 , which are separated from the central hard process by rapidity gaps .",
    "hard diffraction has been studied intensely in deep - inelastic @xmath2 scattering ( dis ) at hera , where it can be understood due to the presence of the large squared photon virtuality @xmath3 in terms of the pomeron structure function @xmath4 , factorizing into diffractive parton density functions ( dpdfs ) @xmath5 and perturbatively calculable partonic cross sections @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "assuming in addition regge factorization , the dpdfs @xmath7 can be parameterized in terms of a pomeron flux factor @xmath8 , which depends on the longitudinal momentum fraction of the pomeron in the proton @xmath9 and the squared four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex @xmath10 , and pdfs in the pomeron @xmath11 , which depend on the momentum fraction of the partons in the pomeron @xmath12 and an unphysical factorization scale @xmath3 , and fitted to diffractive dis data @xcite .",

    "as @xmath3 decreases , the applicability of perturbative qcd must be ensured by sufficiently large jet transverse energies @xmath13 . from the absorption of collinear initial - state singularities at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite ,",
    "the photon develops a hadronic structure and contributes not only with direct , but also resolved processes @xcite .",
    "these processes occur also in hadron - hadron scattering , where factorization is broken due to the presence of soft interactions in both the initial and final states @xcite , and factorization breaking is indeed observed in dijet photoproduction at nlo @xcite .",
    "similar effects may also arise in dijet production with a leading neutron @xcite .",
    "soft rescattering must be understood , if one wishes to exploit processes like diffractive higgs production , which offers a promising alternative to the difficult inclusive diphoton signal in the low - mass region @xcite . in this article , we present the first nlo analysis of diffractive dijet production in hadron collisions @xcite .",
    "dijet production with a leading antiproton has been measured by the cdf collaboration at the tevatron in the range @xmath14 gev@xmath15 , used also by the h1 collaboration for the extraction of their pdfs 2006 fit a , b and 2007 fit jets , but at slightly larger @xmath16 $ ] @xcite . from the ratio @xmath17 of single - diffractive ( sd ) to non - diffractive ( nd ) cross sections as a function of @xmath18 , integrated over @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 , an effective diffractive structure function @xmath21 was extracted assuming @xmath22 $ ] with grv 98 lo proton pdfs and compared to older h1 diffractive structure functions at fixed @xmath23 gev@xmath15 .",
    "these were found to overestimate the measured diffractive structure function by about an order of magnitude , while the correction to be applied to the h1 measurements with @xmath24 gev , when compared to the cdf measurements with leading antiprotons , should only be about 23% @xcite .    in a subsequent publication , the cdf collaboration analyzed in a similar way data at @xmath25 gev , not only 1800 gev , in order to test factorization , pomeron flux renormalization , and rapidity - gap survival models @xcite , but found no significant energy dependence @xcite .",
    "in addition they restricted the @xmath26-range to below 0.2 gev@xmath15 and the average transverse jet energy to @xmath27 gev , which has the advantage of removing the infrared sensitivity of two equal cuts on @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in both publications , the extraction of @xmath28 was performed on the basis of leading order ( lo ) qcd and assuming that the @xmath10-channel gluon exchange in the partonic cross sections dominates .",
    "our nlo qcd analysis is based on previous work on inclusive dijet photoproduction @xcite , where the resolved photon contribution can be directly applied to dijet hadroproduction @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the convolution of pomeron flux factors and pdfs , modern cteq6.6 m proton and h1 2006 and 2007 pomeron pdfs with @xmath29 on an event - by - event basis , and the complete set of parton - parton scattering cross sections .",

    "their qualitative behavior in these three figures is very similar : we observe a dependence on @xmath36 with a minimum at @xmath41 @xmath42 , a rise towards smaller @xmath36 by up to a factor of five , a smaller rise towards larger @xmath36 , and an appreciable dependence of the suppression factor on the chosen diffractive pdfs .",
    "the corresponding suppression factors for @xmath43 ( not shown ) , computed with the same assumptions on @xmath44 as those taken by cdf , are minimal with the value @xmath45 at @xmath46 and rise to @xmath47 for @xmath38 gev and to @xmath48 for @xmath25 gev at @xmath49 and with h1 2006 fit b. here , the effect of nlo corrections is partially compensated by the simplifications inherent in the calculation of @xmath28 .",
    "the strong rise of the suppression factors to values of @xmath50 for @xmath51 @xmath52 $ ] at @xmath38 gev may not be conclusive , since the h1 dpdfs are largely unconstrained in this region .",
    "on the other hand , the rise at @xmath53 can be attributed to the reggeon contribution , that should be added at large @xmath9 .",
    "note also that the variation of the suppression factor is considerably reduced for the h1 2007 fit jets , which has been obtained with additional constraints from diffractive dis dijet production .",
    "the extraction of @xmath54 from @xmath55 is based on the assumption that the latter is only weakly @xmath9-dependent and can be evaluated at an average value of @xmath56 .",
    "this weak @xmath9-dependence is indeed observed in the newer cdf data and also in our theoretical calculations , which reflect the @xmath9-dependence of the h1 fits to the pomeron flux factors @xmath57 with @xmath58 ( 0.9 in the cdf fit to their data ) .",
    "the ( small ) difference of the theoretical ( 1.1 ) and experimental ( 0.9 ) values of @xmath59 can be explained by a subleading reggeon contribution , which has not been included in our predictions . to study its importance , we have computed the ratio of the reggeon over the pomeron contribution to the lo single - diffractive cross section at @xmath38 gev .",
    "the reggeon flux factor was obtained from h1 2006 fit b and convolved , as it was done in this fit , with parton densities in the pion @xcite .",
    "very similar results were obtained for the h1 2007 fit jets reggeon flux . on average , the reggeon adds a 5% contribution to the single - diffractive cross section , which is smaller at small @xmath60 and @xmath9 ( 2.5% ) than at large @xmath36 and @xmath9 ( 8% ) .",
    "this corresponds to the graphs shown in figs .",
    "5 ( @xmath61 ) and 6 ( @xmath62 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , e.g.  at @xmath63 gev@xmath15 .",
    "while the reggeon contribution thus increases the diffractive cross section and reduces the suppression factor at large @xmath36 , making the latter more constant , the same is less true at small values of @xmath36 .",
    "any model calculation of the suppression factor or rapidity - gap survival probability must try to explain two points , first the amount of suppression , which is @xmath48 at @xmath49 , and second its dependence on the variable @xmath12 ( or @xmath36 ) .",
    "such a calculation has been performed by kaidalov et al .",
    "@xcite . in this calculation , the hard scattering cross section for the diffractive production of dijets was supplemented by screening or absorptive corrections on the basis of eikonal corrections in impact parameter space .",
    "the parameters of the eikonal were obtained from a two - channel description of high - energy inelastic diffraction .",
    "the exponentiation of the eikonal stands for the exchange of multi - pomeron contributions , which violate regge and qcd factorization and modify the predictions based on single pomeron and/or regge exchange .",
    "the obtained suppression factor is not universal , but depends on the details of the hard subprocess as well as on the kinematic configurations .",
    "the first important observation from this calculation is that in the tevatron dijet analysis the mass squared of the produced dijet system @xmath64 as well as @xmath9 are almost constant , so that small @xmath12 implies large @xmath65 .",
    "the second important ingredient in this calculation is the assumption that the absorption cross section of the valence and the sea components , where the latter includes the gluon , of the incoming proton are different , in particular , that the valence and sea components correspond to smaller and larger absorption . for large @xmath65 or small @xmath12",
    ", the valence quark contribution dominates , which produces smaller absorptive cross sections as compared to the sea quark and gluon contributions , which dominate at small @xmath65 . hence the survival probability increases as @xmath65 increases and @xmath12 decreases .",
    "the convolution of the @xmath12-dependent absorption corrections with older h1 dpdfs @xcite led to a prediction for @xmath66 , which was in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental distribution ( see fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "a similar correction for soft rescattering of our single - diffractive nlo cross sections based on the more recent dpdfs of h1 should lead to a very similar result . an alternative model for the calculation of the suppression factor was developed by gotsman et al .",
    "@xcite . however , these authors did not convolve their suppression mechanism with the hard scattering cross section",
    ". therefore a direct comparison to the cdf data is not possible .    at variance with the above discussion of diffractive dijet production in hadron - hadron scattering , the survival probability in diffractive dijet photoproduction",
    "was found to be larger ( @xmath67 for global suppression , @xmath68 for resolved photon suppression only ) and fairly independent of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the hera analyses are restricted to large values of @xmath69 ( as opposed to small and intermediate values of @xmath70 ... @xmath71 at the tevatron ) , where direct photons or their fluctuations into perturbative or vector meson - like valence quarks dominate .",
    "the larger suppression factor in photoproduction corresponds also to the smaller center - of - mass energy available at hera .",
