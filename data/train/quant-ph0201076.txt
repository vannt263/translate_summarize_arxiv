    "the engineering of novel quantum states of photons is a topic of interest fundamentally and for applications .",
    "as is well known in atomic and particle physics , exotic states could result from scattering processes .",
    "this suggests light scattering by suitable quantum systems can be an important tool for state engineering .",
    "a common and yet realistic situation in quantum optics involves the scattering of photon wave packets , comprising a few photons , from atoms and other photons situated inside an optical cavity .",
    "the atoms and the cavity field together form a cavity qed system that scatters incident photon packets ( fig .",
    "the main question is : what is the quantum state of the scattered photons ? as the cornerstone of a series of investigations of this topic , we establish in the present paper a propagator method to describe the scattering of photon packets from a cavity where a two - level atom , either in its ground or excited state , is placed with the companion of some quasi - mode photons .",
    "after the interaction , the input photons and the quasi - mode photons as well leak out of the cavity and become the output state of the system .",
    "the propagator method proposed here is capable to extract the details of the output state and thus form a powerful tool to analyze the physical content underlying the scattering process .",
    "in addition to its potential applications in the study of novel quantum states , the model considered here is in fact a generalized variant of the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite , which has been a fundamental model in the realm of photon - atom interaction ever since its first introduction @xcite .",
    "not only does it provide the simplest description of an atom interacting with quantized fields in optical cavities , jcm is also an important tool for controlling quantum states @xcite .",
    "one prominent generalization of the jcm is the inclusion of the leakage effect of the cavity , which is inevitable in any real experimental setup .",
    "indeed recent studies in cavity qed have also emphasized the important role of dissipation effects in quantum information devices @xcite .    in conventional approaches to jcm in a leaky cavity it is customary to consider the space outside the cavity  the environment  as a markovian bath , followed by solving the master equation of the reduced density matrix of the cavity field @xcite .",
    "thus , energy inside the cavity flows unidirectionally to the environment , which plays the role of a sink of energy and the information on the exact state of the environment is reckoned unimportant and is lost during the evolution .",
    "the model discussed in this paper distinguishes itself from other dissipative jcm s in that the cavity and its environment play an equal role during the interaction .",
    "these two parts , constituting the  universe \" in consideration , communicate their information through partially transmitting walls dividing them .",
    "photons inside the cavity , described in terms of discrete quasi - modes , interact with the atom and eventually leak out of the cavity . on the other hand , incident photons characterized by continuous wave number",
    "enter the cavity , participate in the interactions with the atom , and leave the cavity in its final state as well .",
    "more importantly , these two kinds of photons lose their respective identities after entering ( or returning to ) the environment and interfere to form novel photon states .",
    "it is for this reason that we devote the current paper to a proper formalism describing this generalized jcm model .    to this end , we present here a propagator method that solves directly the quantum state of the whole amalgamated system , consisting of the atom , the cavity and the environment . rather than discrete cavity modes",
    ", the atom now couples with the continuous field modes of the whole system @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the artificial separation between the cavity and its environment is completely eliminated , and the effect of dissipation can be treated in a more rigorous and fundamental way . once the propagator of the system is known , the exact details of the output photons can be obtained immediately without further ado .",
    "this knowledge is bound to be important for issues related to quantum information and quantum measurement .",
    "the pure state approach has previously been used to study resonance fluorescence @xcite and spontaneous atomic decay in a vacuum cavity , and exact solutions have been found @xcite .",
    "the major objective in the present paper is to formulate a comprehensive theory studying the dynamical response of a two - level atom under the influence of photons inside the cavity and from the environment . in a recent paper by the authors @xcite , a less general case with the input photons restricted to the cavity mode ( i.e. , quasi - mode )",
    "was considered and solved by method of laplace transform .",
    "this restriction is now removed in this paper . by evaluating the propagator of the system ,",
    "whose construction is based on a diagrammatic expansion method , one can readily handle situations with an arbitrary initial state . under the rotating - wave - approximation",
    ", the full propagator is a block diagonal matrix with a sequence of @xmath1 matrices forming its diagonal block .",
    "each of these matrices is a propagator of the system in a subspace categorized by the total excitation number @xmath2 ( to be defined rigorously in sect .",
    "iv ) , providing a natural classification of relevant propagators .",
    "a construction method is established here to express the @xmath2-excitation propagators in terms of those of the lower excitations .",
    "thus , the full propagator of the system can be obtained in a systematic way , paving the way for further investigation into the quantum state of the output photons .",

    "ii , we describe the system under study , its normal modes , the atom - field interactions and obtain the hamiltonian .",
    "an introduction on the propagator method and the related diagrammatic expansion will be given in sec .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath50 of the atom with the @xmath46-mode photon depends on the dipole moment of the atom and is proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "here we are particularly interested in the case where the transition frequency of the atom is close to one of the resonance frequencies of the cavity , say , @xmath52 .",
    "hence , only those continuous modes with frequencies near @xmath52 have significant interactions with the atom and in this single - mode approximation , @xmath53 .    despite that the atom ostensibly couples with both the r and l modes",
    ", it is always possible to use a unitary transformation to redefine the photon modes so that the atom interacts with only one set of modes . for concreteness",
