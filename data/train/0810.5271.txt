    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) tells us that quarks and gluons are confined inside hadrons in vacuum or ground state .",
    "no free quarks and gluons are detected in any hadronic collisions .",
    "finite temperature theory of qcd predicts that the deconfinement of quarks and gluons can be reached at high temperatures and densities and a new state of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , can be created @xcite .",
    "according to lattice qcd calculations the confinement - deconfinement phase transition takes place at temperature of about 170 mev in three flavor case @xcite .",
    "in early 1970s lee and greiner and his collaborators proposed that the deconfinement could be realized by smashing two heavy ions together at ultrarelativistic energies @xcite .",
    "this is the only way of generating qgp in laboratories . the minimum energy density for deconfinement to take place is about an order of magnitude higher than normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the current energy frontier of heavy ion collisions is the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) , which has been running since the summer of 2000 .",
    "a lot of evidences imply that the qgp at rhic is near perfect fluid ( strongly coupled qgp or sqgp ) , which is contrary to the conventional concept of qgp as a weakly interacting gas of quarks and gluons , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "while perturbation can be used to deal with weak coupling problems , there are a lot of difficulties in describing a strongly coupled system due to its non - linear feature and failure of perturbative methods . in recent years",
    "a promising method to deal with strong coupling problems in gauge theory is through string / gauge duality or precisely ads / cft duality , where ads and cft are abbreviations for anti - de sitter space and conformal field theory respectively .",
    "the duality was first proposed by maldacena and many others @xcite , where a strongly coupled conformal gauge field theory corresponds to weekly coupled closed strings at t hooft limit .",
    "so properties of a weekly coupled string can provide information for strongly coupled gauge theory .",
    "policastro , son and starinets first used ads / cft duality to calculate transport coefficients of strongly coupled dense matter @xcite .",

    "the kss bound is valid for any conformal fluids .",
    "altough it is debatable that the sqgp is a conformal fluid , the ratio @xmath8 is fixed to be the kss bound in all periods of the sqgp evolution in some hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "however the sqgp formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions has particular geometric configurations such as boost invariance @xcite etc .. janik and peschanski first considered a proper time dependent @xmath4 metric with boost invariance through holographic renormalization in late time of fluid evolution @xcite .",
    "the method has been extended to sqgp with shear viscosity @xcite , where the shear viscosity appears in energy - momentum tensor in cft and finally enter in the @xmath4 metric .",

    "if we treat the proper time dependent @xmath4 metric without viscosity as an extension of standard ads metric we can build up a connection between the sqgp as an ideal fluid to the sym plasma , then the ratio @xmath8 may not be zero .    in this paper , we investigate the 2 + 1-dimensional expansion ( also including 1 + 1-dimensional expansion ) of the sqgp in late time and obtain the proper time dependent @xmath4 metric through holographic renormalization .",
    "the metric dual to the sqgp fluid can be obtained by solving the einstein equation with the stress tensor of sqgp as boundary value of the metric if transverse expansion is small and can be treated as a perturbation .",
