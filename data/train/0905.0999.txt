    "the electromagnetic production of strangeness on nucleon provides us with additional information about the structure and interactions of baryons . beyond investigation of the reaction mechanism , form factors of hadrons and new `` missing '' resonances",
    "one also needs a correct description of the process for a study of more complex processes such as the electroproduction of hypernuclei . a good quality description of the elementary process minimises uncertainty in calculations of the excited spectra for the hypernucleus electroproduction  @xcite .",
    "many new good quality experimental data for the k@xmath0 production collected in jlab , elsa , spring-8 , and graal allow performing a thorough analysis of the elementary process . moreover , the recent data on the photoproduction of k@xmath1 off deuteron from tohoku university  @xcite facilitate doing more rigorous tests of elementary amplitudes  @xcite .    the electroproduction process can be formally reduced to investigation of the binary process of the photoproduction by virtual photons since the electromagnetic coupling constant is small enough to justify the one - photon approximation .",
    "there are several approaches to treat the photoproduction process . among them",
    "the isobar models based on the effective lagrangian description considering only the hadronic degrees of freedom are suitable for their further use in the more complex calculations .",
    "other approaches are eligible either for higher energies ( @xmath2 gev ) , the regge model  @xcite , or to the threshold region , the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "quark models  @xcite are too complicated for their further use in the hypernuclear calculations .",
    "another approach , aimed at the forward - angle production , is the hybrid regge - plus - resonance model  @xcite in which the background part of amplitude is generated by the @xmath3-channel regge - trajectory exchange and the resonant behaviour is shaped by the s - channel resonances like in an isobar model .",
    "in the effective hadron lagrangian approach , various channels connected via the final - state interaction ( the meson - baryon rescattering processes ) have to be treated simultaneously to take unitarity properly into account  @xcite . in ref .",
    "the coupled - channel approach has been used to include effects of the @xmath4n intermediate states in the p(@xmath5,k@xmath0)@xmath6 process . however ,",
    "tremendous simplifications originate in neglecting the rescattering effects in the formalism assuming that they are included to some extent by means of effective values of the strong coupling constants fitted to data .",
    "this simplifying assumption was adopted in many of the isobar models , e.g. , saclay - lyon ( sla )  @xcite , kaon - maid ( km )  @xcite , and janssen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .    in isobar models",
    ", the amplitude obtains contributions from the born terms and exchanges of resonances .",
    "due to absence of a dominant resonance in the process ( unlike in the @xmath4 and @xmath7 photoproduction ) large number of possible combinations of the resonances with mass smaller than 2 gev must be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "this number of models is limited considering constraints set by su(3 )  @xcite and crossing symmetries  @xcite and by duality hypothesis  @xcite . adopting the su(3 ) constraints to the two main coupling constants",
    ", however , makes the contribution of the born terms nonphysically large  @xcite . to reduce this contribution",
    ", either hyperon resonances  @xcite or hadron form factors  @xcite must be added , or a combination of both@xcite .",
    "the hadron form factors which simulate a structure in the strong vertex are included in the km and janssen models maintaining the gauge invariance of amplitude  @xcite .",
    "here we use the km and sla models .",
    "the strong coupling constants in the k@xmath8 and k@xmath9 channels are related via the su(2 ) isospin symmetry : @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the electromagnetic vertexes",
    "a ratio of the neutral to charged coupling constants have to be known . for the nucleon and its resonances",
    "the ratio can be related to the known helicity amplitudes of the nucleons  @xcite whereas for the kaon resonances the ratio relates to the decay widths known only for the k@xmath12 meson  @xcite : r@xmath13 where the sign was set from the quark model prediction",
    ". since the decay widths of the k@xmath14 meson are unknown the appropriate ratio , r@xmath15 , have to be fixed in the models .",
    "it was fitted to the k@xmath16 data in km  @xcite , r@xmath17 , but it is a free parameter in sla ( see also refs .   and ) . for hyperons ,",
    "the electromagnetic vertex is not changed in the k@xmath8 channel .",
    "the inclusive cross section for the d(@xmath5,k@xmath1)yn or d(@xmath5,@xmath6)kn process ( y stands for @xmath6 or @xmath18 and n for proton or neutron ) in the threshold region is calculated in the impulse approximation in which the nucleon n acts as a spectator  @xcite .",
    "contributions of the final - state interaction ( fsi ) to the inclusive cross section were shown to be small in the studied kinematical region  @xcite . moreover , we assume that a part of the ky rescattering effects is absorbed in the coupling constants of the elementary amplitude and that the kn interaction is weak on the hadronic scale . the main lack of precision , therefore , comes from ignoring the yn fsi .    in the calculations we have chosen the _ off - shell _ approximation  @xcite in which the four - momentum is conserved in the production vertex forcing the target nucleon off its mass shell .",
    "the momentum distribution of the target nucleon is described by the nonrelativistic bonn deuteron wave function obepq  @xcite .",
    "more details about the calculations can be found in ref .  .",
    "the existing isobar models do not give satisfactory description of the new data on the k@xmath0 photoproduction , especially of the spin observables  @xcite . here",
    "we mention only the difference in results of the models for the forward kaon - angle cross section which causes substantial uncertainty in predictions for the hypernucleus photoproduction cross sections  @xcite . at very forward angle , @xmath19 , and photon lab energy 1.42 gev ,",
    "the lab cross sections predicted by the sla and km models are 2.24 and 1.60 @xmath20b / sr , respectively .",
    "this 30% discrepancy gives corresponding difference in results for the photoproduction of @xmath21b@xmath22 at 1.42 gev : the excitation cross sections for the two main multiplets ( @xmath6 in @xmath23 and @xmath24 state is coupled to the ground state of the core nucleus @xmath25b ) are 169 and 173 nb / sr for sla and 119 and 127 nb / sr for km , respectively .",
    "we see that the elementary amplitude needs to be better fixed at forward angles to give reliable results for the hypernucleus calculations .",
    "studying the process in other channels , e.g. , n(@xmath5,k@xmath1)@xmath6 , might help in this respect .        in figure  [ figure1 ] results for the inclusive momentum spectra of the d(@xmath5,k@xmath1)@xmath6p process calculated with different elementary amplitudes",
    "are shown in comparison with the recent data from lns of tohoku university  @xcite .",
    "contributions of the @xmath18 channels are very small in the lower - energy region ( l.e.r . )",
    "[ figure1]a ) and at the spectator - kinematics region ( the main peak ) in fig .",
    "[ figure1]b  @xcite .",
    "the km model do not describe the data well , especially at the spectator - kinematics region .",
    "results of km can not be improved even if the r@xmath15 parameter is fitted to the l.e.r .",
    "data : @xmath26= 3.64 with r@xmath15= -2.34 . the sla model with r@xmath15= -2.09 , fitted to the l.e.r . data",
    "( @xmath26= 0.88 )  @xcite , gives good results in both energy regions .",
    "the angular dependence of the elementary cross sections differs for these models as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] . to point out importance of the angular dependence of cross section the phenomenological prescriptions ph1 and ph2 ( see ref .   for details ) were used .",
    "ph1 which possesses the backward - peaked cross section , fig",
    ".  [ figure2 ] , gives much better results for d(@xmath5,k@xmath1)@xmath6p than ph2 with the opposite angular dependence ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "this comparison shows that the tohoku data prefer models which give a backward - peaked cross section for the n(@xmath5,k@xmath1)@xmath6 reaction .",
    "significance of various contributions in the elementary cross section at @xmath27 gev is shown for sla and km in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "if the contribution of neutron or k@xmath14 is omitted in sla the cross sections change largely , fig .",
    "[ figure3]a , whereas the omission of both terms simultaneously makes a very small effect .",
    "this shows that the main role of k@xmath14 , with the fitted parameter r@xmath15 , is to compensate the neutron contribution .",
    "this phenomenon is absent in km , fig .",
    "[ figure3]b , since the neutron contribution itself is already strongly suppressed by the hadron form factor . in both models the contribution of k@xmath12 is important at large @xmath28 .",
    "the hyperon resonances , included in sla but not in km , also contribute notably at backward angles ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]a ) .",
    "the nucleon resonances give a negligible contribution at @xmath29 in both models .      in figure  [ figure4 ]",
    "predictions of the km and sla models for the momentum spectra of d(@xmath5,@xmath6)k@xmath0n and d(@xmath5,@xmath6)k@xmath1p ( a ) are shown with the angular dependence of the elementary cross sections ( b ) .",
    "the models give significantly different results for the k@xmath1 production whereas they accord for the k@xmath0 channel .",
    "this shows that the k@xmath1 photoproduction on deuteron provides with additional information about dynamics of the elementary process .    to summarise : the isobar models for the k@xmath0 photoproduction need revision at forward kaon angles before they can give reliable predictions for the hypernuclear calculations .",
    "the data on the d(@xmath5,k@xmath1)yn reaction near the threshold clearly prefer the models for the n(@xmath5,k@xmath1)@xmath6 reaction which give enhancement of the cross section at the backward kaon angles .",
    "these data can , therefore , discriminate between the models which otherwise fit the p(@xmath5,k@xmath0)@xmath6 data equally well .",
