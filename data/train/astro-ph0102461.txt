    "the cosmic mass density field seems to posses two basic features which at first glance appear contradictory .",
    "the first is the statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the field .",
    "the second is that the mass field consists of isolated density peaks like galaxies and clusters of galaxies , in which the mass densities are much higher than average .",
    "moreover , coherent structures , like filaments , sheets and even cellular or network structures with characteristic lengths have been detected in galaxy distributions .",
    "these two features can be reconciled by assuming the formation of a highly intermittent field from an initially gaussian random field . in this scenario , the growth of structure in the mass field is initially linear and randomness is the mechanism by which structure is formed . at later stages ,",
    "non - linearities enter the dynamics and prevent infinite growth . as a result ,",
    "the structures that thereby arise in the random mass field have an interesting character : they are strong enhancements ( peaks ) of the density field scattered in a space with a low density background .",
    "this feature generally is called intermittency and was originally introduced for describing the temperature and velocity distributions in turbulence ( batchelor & townsend 1949 ; for review , see frisch , 1995 . )",
    "an early attempt of studying the formation of the large scale coherent structures from a random field is the theory of pancakes ( zeldovich 1970 ) .",
    "this work is the predecessor of the intermittency approach to the formation of coherent structures ( shandarin & zeldovich 1984 ; for a review , see shandarin & zeldovich 1989 ) .",
    "the intermittency picture is supported by modelling the cosmic matter distribution in non - linear regime with lognormal(ln ) random field , which is a simplest model of intermittency behavior in random fields ( e.g. zeldovich , ruzmaikin , & sokoloff 1990 ) . the ln model has been found to reporoduce the nonlinear matter distribution evolved from gaussian initial conditions and gives rise to spatial patterns characterized statistically by a kind of intermittency ( heterotopicity ) ( cole and jones , 1991 ; jones , coles & martinez , 1992 ) . the ln model of the baryonic matter distribution ( bi & davidsen , 1997 ) has also been successfully applied to explain the non - gaussian features of the underlying mass field traced by ly@xmath6 forests ( feng & fang 2000 ) .    the intermittency picture is also supported by the singular density profile of massive halos ( like @xmath9 with exponent @xmath10 ) given by n - body simulations ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white , 1997 , jing & suto 2000 . )",
    "this profile indicates that the events of large differences between the local densities separated by small distances @xmath11 are more frequent than with a gaussian field .",
    "as such the probability distribution function(pdf ) of the density difference , @xmath12 , on small scales @xmath11 is long tailed .",
    "the pdf of @xmath13 can only be effectively detected by a scale - space decomposition because @xmath13 consists of both scale @xmath11 and position @xmath14 .",
    "a scale - space decomposition analysis of the mass density field traced by the ly@xmath6 forests has indeed obtained more direct evidence of the intermittency ( jamkhedkar , zhan , & fang 2000 . )",
    "they found that the pdf of @xmath13 is gaussian on scale @xmath11 larger than about 2 h@xmath7 mpc , but becomes longed tailed as @xmath11 decreases .",
    "hence , the random mass field traced by the ly@xmath6 transmitted flux shows an excess of large fluctuation on small scales in comparison to a gaussian distribution .",
    "this is typical of an intermittent field ( shraiman & siggia 2000 . )",
    "it seems that intermittency is a common feature of the non - linearly evolved cosmic mass field . at the same time",
    ", hierarchical clustering is believed to be a common feature of the non - linearly evolved cosmic mass field , and has been widely applied to construct semi - analytic models of gravitational clustering in the universe ( e.g. white 1979 ) . although hierarchical clustered fields show indeed some kind of intermittency , it is unclear whether the correlation hierarchy is consistent with the observed intermittency of the cosmic mass field .",
    "for instance , in the ln model , the high order correlations do not satisfy a hierarchical relation , but obey a well - known kirkwood scaling relation ( kirkwood , 1935 ; peebles , 1980 ) .",
    "therefore , a ln random field is intermittent , but does not satisfy the hierarchical clustering .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between intermittency and hierarchical clustering .",
    "we will not limit ourselves to special models of intermittency , but will try to calculate the intermittent feature of a hierarchical clustered field in general .",
    "we first introduce the intermittent exponent which gives a detailed classification of the non - linear clustering .",
    "specifically it gives a complete and uniform description of the nonlinearity of the cosmic mass field from initially gaussian perturbations , to weak , and eventually strong non - linear clustering .",
    "we then study the intermittent exponent predicted by the hierarchical clustering .",
    "as expected , the intermittent behavior given by the hierarchical clustering model is found to be in good agreement with observed results on large scales .",
    "however , for the highly non - linearly evolved field , we find that the simplest correlation hierarchy , i.e. , one with constant coefficients @xmath4 , is no longer adequate to describe the observed features in the density field . in this case",
    ", the model of hierarchical clustering with scale dependent @xmath4 may still work .",
    "moreover , we find the relationship between the intermittent and singular behaviors of the cosmic mass field and the scale dependence of the @xmath4 .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows .",
    " 2 introduces the basic statistical measures of the intermittency of random mass fields  the structure function and intermittent exponent . ",
    "3 presents the predicted intermittency of a hierarchically clustered field .",
    "the singular behavior of the hierarchical clustering with scale - dependent @xmath4 will be discussed in  4 .",
    "the comparison of the intermittency and singular behaviors of a hierarchically clustered field with samples of qso s ly-@xmath6 forests is given in  5 .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussions are in  6 .",
    "the chief characteristic of an intermittent field is that the interesting stuff happens in a local area . as a consequence ,",
    "the description of intermittent fields by traditional methods such as the fourier power spectrum are ineffective because these methods are essentially non - local .",
    "for instance , the amplitudes of the fourier coefficients lose the spatial information .",
    "two fields which have a similar gaussian pdf of the amplitudes of the fourier coefficient may have very different intermittent features .",
    "though the phases of the fourier coefficients do contain the spatial information , they are not computationally convenient .",
    "the density profiles described in  1 look to be a good way to the measure mass density peaks .",
    "the profiles are , however , only a measure for the individual massive halos and not a statistical measure of the entire random field consisting of these peaks . for example , imagine a homogeneous gaussian field in a cubic box with 128@xmath15 grids , which corresponds to 128@xmath15 realizations of a gaussian random variable .",
    "rare peaks as high as 4@xmath16 will occur at some points .",
    "obviously , the individual density profiles are useless in measuring the excess of the large density fluctuations with respect to a gaussian distribution .",
    "moreover , the exponent @xmath17 introduced with the individual density profiles @xmath18 can not be used to describe a statistically homogeneous and isotropic field , which requires that proper measures be statistically invariant quantities under translational and rotational transformations .",
    "the proper measure of an intermittent field should satisfy the following conditions simultaneously : 1 . its second order statistics should describe the power spectrum of the field , and 2 .",
    "the correlations of phases should describe coherent structures .",
    "we show in this section that the structure functions in the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) representation meet these conditions .",
    "the basic quantity for describing the intermittency of a random density field @xmath19 is the _ difference _ between the densities at the position @xmath14 with separation @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] is the density contrast . for simplicity , we assume that the density is normalized , @xmath23 .",
    "the density difference is essential to describe the most important intermittent characteristics of a mass field .",
    "these features include :    \\1 . _ the power spectrum and the local power spectrum . _    the ensemble average of the second moment of @xmath13 is @xmath24 if the field is homogeneous , @xmath25 is independent of @xmath14 and depends only on @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath25 is the mean power of the density fluctuations at wavenumber @xmath26 , and therefore , @xmath25 is the power spectrum of the field ( see  2.3 ) . for a given realization of the random field , @xmath27 is the _ local _ power spectrum at @xmath14 . for an intermittent field",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath28 is highly irregular or spiky .",
    "the power of the density fluctuations on small @xmath11 is highly localized in space with very low powers between these spikes .",

    "\\2 . _ the long - tailed pdf of _ @xmath29 .",
    "one of the defining characteristics of an intermittent field is the long - tailed pdf of @xmath29 on small scales @xmath11 .",

    "since the resolution of real and simulation samples is always finite , one can not practically measure the individual singularity of @xmath51 at position @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",

    "hence , one can measure the singular exponent @xmath6 as a statistical property of the random field , rather than using the density profiles of the individual massive halos .",
    "we should make an important distinction between statistics based on @xmath55 and statistics that use the density @xmath19 or density contrast @xmath56 .",
    "the former is the _ difference _ in either the density @xmath19 or the density contrast @xmath56 at different positions in space .",
    "it is possible that a large difference @xmath57 on small scales occurs in regions of low density , and also possible that a small difference occurs in regions of high density .",
    "to study intermittency , data which samples the entire cosmic mass field is necessary .    finally , an advantage of using the local density difference is in reducing the contamination of the random velocity field .",
    "it is well known that the random velocity field will smooth the mass field in redshift space and repress the power of the density perturbations on scales below that characterized by the velocity dispersion .",

    "using eq.(39 ) , the singular exponent @xmath17 can be expressed by @xmath180 as @xmath181 eq .",
    "( 45 ) shows that the singular index @xmath17 is determined by the scale - dependence of the coefficients @xmath144 and the non - linear power spectrum @xmath182 .    the important point of eq.(45 )",
    "is that the l.h.s .",
    "is given by the singular profiles such as @xmath183 , independent of @xmath5 , while the r.h.s .",
    "consists of @xmath5-dependent quantities like @xmath180 .",
    "therefore , a test of the scale - dependent @xmath184 model is to check whether @xmath17 given by eq.(45 ) is @xmath5-independent when @xmath5 is large .",
    "it is known that a scale - dependent intermittent exponent indicates that the mass field is no longer monofractal , but is instead , multifractal ( farge at al .",
    "galaxy distributions have been shown to be multi - fractal in nature ( jones et.al , 1988 ) and to explain this distribution , a phenomenological model of non - linear fragmentation with multi - scaling parameters has been proposed ( jones , coles & martinez , 1992 ) .",
    "our present study has revealed the intrinsic relationships between the scale - dependence of @xmath144 , multifractal nature , and singular behavior of the mass field .",
    "this completes our derivation of intermittency within hierarchical clustering . with eq.(18 )",
    "we pick up the dwt power spectrum , eq.(37 ) gives the intermittency exponent predicted by the hierarchical picture , eq.(42 ) provides a way to check for the scale dependence of the correlation coefficients , and eq.(45 ) gives a measure of singular behavior of the field .",
    "the versatility of this approach is clear .",
    "since the intermittent and singular features of the cosmic mass field are measured by the scale - dependence of the structure functions , samples covering a large range of scales are best suited for this analysis .",
    "as has been emphasized , the intermittent and singular features are traits of the mass field and not of the individual massive halos . as such , the transmitted flux of qso s ly@xmath6 forests given by high resolution absorption spectrum are ideal data sets with which to work .",
    "the ly@xmath6 transmitted flux is due to absorption by gases in cool and low density regions .",
    "the pressure gradients are generally less than the gravitational forces .",
    "the distribution of cool baryonic diffuse matter is almost point - by - point proportional to the underlying dark matter density ( bi , ge & fang 1995 ) .",
    "the statistical features of the underlying mass field of the ly@xmath6 forests can be detected by the transmitted flux .",
    "we use the ly@xmath6 transmitted flux of qso hs1700 + 64 ( @xmath185 = 2.72 ) for our analysis .",
    "this sample has been employed to study the baryonic matter density ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) , the fourier and dwt power spectra and non - gaussian features ( feng & fang 2000 ) .",
    "the recovered power spectrum has been found to be consistent with the cdm cosmogony on scales larger than about 0.1 @xmath186 mpc .",
    "the data ranges from 3727.012@xmath187 to 5523.554 , for a total of 55882 pixels . on average ,",
    "a pixel is about 0.028 , equivalent to a physical distance of @xmath188 h@xmath7 kpc at @xmath189 for an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "these scales weakly depend on cosmological density parameter @xmath190 .",
    "one can safely ignore the effect of the non - linear relation between redshift and distance for our present analysis .",
    "in this paper , we use the data from @xmath191 3815.6@xmath187 to 4434.3 , which corresponds to @xmath192 .",
    "the comoving spatial size of our data is @xmath193 h@xmath7 mpc in the cdm model .",
    "this means for scale @xmath87 , the spatial size is @xmath194 h@xmath7 mpc .    with ly@xmath6 data",
    "there is always the danger of contamination from the presence of metal lines .",
    "we use three ways to estimate the error this contamination causes .",
    "first , we block out the significant metal line regions . since the wfc @xmath77 are localized , the metal line regions are easily separated from the rest . any effect from these regions",
    "can be removed by not counting the dwt modes in the blocked regions .",
    "the second way is to fill those regions with random data which has the same mean power as the rest of the original data and to smooth the data over the boundaries .",
    "lastly we discard the metal line chunks and smoothly connect the good chunks of data .",
    "we find that the results not sensitive to the method of removing metal lines .",
    "another source of contamination is noise . to estimate the effect of noise we smooth the qso s spectrum by filtering out all extremely sharp spikes in the local power spectra on finest scales .",
    "these spikes are caused by relatively strong fluctuations between two neighboring pixels . since",
    "such events are on the smallest scales only , the analysis on larger scales does not depend on whether we smooth the sample or not .    the dwt power spectrum of the ly@xmath6 transmitted flux of qso hs1700 + 64 is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that @xmath3 is larger than 1 on all small scales @xmath195 or physical scales @xmath196 100 h@xmath7 kpc .",
    "we calculate the intermittent exponent with eq.(19 ) , @xmath197 the result is plotted in fig . 2 and shows that on scales @xmath198 , the intermittent exponents are always significantly less than zero .",
    "the underlying mass field of the qso forests is neither non - gaussian nor non - selfsimilar , but essentially intermittent on physical scales less than 100 h@xmath7 kpc .",
    "we next test the predicted relation ( 36 ) between the intermittent exponent and power spectrum .",
    "the results of @xmath157 are plotted in fig .",
    "because the power law index @xmath3 of the dwt power spectrum is generally larger than 1 , @xmath157 is always positive .",
    "this is qualitatively different from @xmath64 on small scales .",
    "therefore , only on large scales @xmath199 or physical scales @xmath200 2 h@xmath7 mpc , does the correlation hierarchy with constant @xmath4 match observations .      to check for hierarchical clustering with scale - dependent coefficients ,",
    "we calculate @xmath144 with eq.(42 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 , which shows that only for lower @xmath5 , can the coefficient approximately be considered as constant .",
    "at all higher @xmath5 , @xmath144 significantly increases with decreasing scale after @xmath201 , which implies the breaking of a single scaling hierarchy in the baryonic matter distribution .    fig .",
    "5 plots the singular exponent @xmath17 calculated by eq.(45 ) .",
    "it indeed shows that for each @xmath87 , @xmath17 is asymptotically independent of @xmath5 , when @xmath5 is large .",
    "that is , models with scale - dependent @xmath4 are reasonable and the asymptotic values of @xmath17 are probably given by the exponent of the singular mass density profile .",
    "5 also show that the singular exponents @xmath17 become larger with increasing scales .",
    "for instance , @xmath202 at @xmath203 , while @xmath204 at @xmath205 .",
    "this is understandable if we consider the so - called `` universal '' density profile of massive halos ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the core radius . from this profile",
    "it is clear that @xmath17 on small scale @xmath208 will be less than for @xmath209 . comparing with ( 47 ) ,",
    "the @xmath17 given by the ly@xmath6 transmitted flux are small and implies that the singular behavior of mass field at redshift @xmath210 is much weaker than the present .",
    "although fig .",
    "5 shows that @xmath211 on scale @xmath205 or @xmath212 7 h@xmath7 kpc , the field is not necessarily singular . for instance , if the profile ( 47 ) is modified as @xmath213 where physical scale @xmath214 5 h@xmath7 kpc , @xmath17 will no longer be positive on scales @xmath215 .",
    "the structure functions provide a complete and unified way of studying intermittent fields . with this method",
    ", we have shown that intermittency and hierarchical clustering in the non - linear mass field are related .",
    "we find that if the field is singular , the intermittent behavior on higher order @xmath5 can be completely described by the singular exponents and the non - linear power spectrum . in this case , the scale - dependencies of the hierarchical clustering coefficients @xmath144 at large @xmath5 are also completely determined by these parameters .",
    "the transmitted flux of hs1700 does show the existence of the asymptotic value of the singular exponents .",
    "the cosmic mass field at redshift @xmath8 is probably weakly singular at least on physical scales as small as 10 h@xmath7 kpc .",
    "a singular field can be neither self - similar nor mono - fractal .",
    "it is well known that under many different conditions the field given by gravitational clustering is self - similar .",
    "therefore , the presence of singular clustering implies a broken self - similarity and/or mono - fractal .    from a dynamical point of view",
    ", there is a basis for understanding the relation between the intermittency and hierarchical clustering .",
    "the basic dynamical processes of hierarchical clustering are the merging of two halos or the accretion of small halos into bigger ones .",
    "regardless of specific processes , either the infall of small halos into massive ones or the merging of massive halos , these processes are stochastic .",
    "thus , the hierarchical clustering is described by equations containing the addition and multiplication of stochastic variables .",
    "but these stochastic processes are typical of the origin of intermittency ( e.g. nakao 1998 . ) .",
    "even when the initial pdf of the random variables is gaussian , the dynamics involving additive and multiplicative stochastic variables will evolve to a long tailed pdf .",
    "for instance , the growth of the mass @xmath216 of a halo is sometimes phenomenologically described by the rate equation of halo mass growth ( e.g. cole & lacey 1996 , salvador - sol , solanes & manrique 1998 . )",
    "the rate equation is a phenomenological model of the formation of intermittency via merging .",
    "the so - called merging history tree theory has widely been employed to describe the mean merging history of individual halos and then to fit with the statistical properties of galaxies .",
    "many merging tree models have been proposed . in the context of intermittency ,",
    "different merging trees have different rules for merging from smaller to larger scales , and therefore , lead to different scale - scale correlations (  2.1 ) .",
    "thus , discrimination among merging tree models is possible via a intermittent analysis .",
