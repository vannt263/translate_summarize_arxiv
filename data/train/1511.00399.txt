    "polar molecules bearing permanent electric dipole moment ( pdm ) can provide the strong , long - range , tunable , spatially anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions @xcite .",
    "they have potential applications from high precision metrology @xcite to chemical dynamics @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite and the simulation of quantum many - body systems @xcite etc .",
    "the pdm reflects direct information about the electronic charge - density distribution of polar molecules , and could be quite different between various electronic states .",
    "the difference of pdm arises from the change of molecular orbital @xcite . for instance",
    ", in the alkaline earth -monohalides and -monohydrides , the decrease of pdm from @xmath0 state to @xmath1 state is the result of the promotion of the sole unpaired valence electron from an s - p hybrid orbital to a more highly polarizable p - d hybrid orbital @xcite . while in the alkaline monohydrides lih",
    ", it is the result of the promotion from an s orbital to a s - p hybrid orbital @xcite .",
    "another type of giant dipole molecules are organic molecules with the delocalized conjugated @xmath2 electrons .",
    "such molecules often have excited electronic states of a charge transfer character , so there can be large differences of pdm between the electronic ground and excited states @xcite .",
    "the interaction of a two - level polar molecule with a classical optical field has been studied by many researchers @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the nonzero difference of pdm between the electronic ground and excited states can significantly affect the coupling between polar molecule and the optical field , and is responsible for some new optical properties which are quite different from a regular atomic system , for instance , multi - photon transition @xcite , nonlinear optical properties @xcite , high harmonic generation @xcite etc .",
    "on the other hand , the study of strong coupling between the matter and the cavity field through quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , in which the interaction strength exceeds the optical transition and cavity mode damping rates , has been the subject of great interests @xcite .",
    "it has broad applications ranging from metrology @xcite and quantum computation @xcite to mechanism for cooling atom and molecule @xcite etc .",
    "nowadays , the researchers have achieved the strong coupling in different physical systems , such as atomic system @xcite , semiconductor quantum dot microcavity @xcite , superconducting qubit circuit qed @xcite , and organic microcavity @xcite .",
    "also , the possibility of cavity - assisted laser cooling of polar molecules has been theoretically proposed @xcite . however , in above - mentioned cavity qed interactions , little attention has been paid to the effect of permanent dipole difference between the ground state and excited state of the molecules which usually plays a role in the nonlinear process . that s our motivation to study the effect of permanent dipole difference in the field of strong coupled polar molecule cavity qed .    for the early work on strong coupled cavity qed ,",
    "the coupling strength @xmath3 was much smaller than the cavity field frequency @xmath4 ( typical values for atom - cavity qed experiments are @xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction can therefore be well described by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model within the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "but recent progress draw our attention to the ultrastrong - coupling regime , for example , the normalized coupling strength @xmath6 for polyelec - trolyte / j aggregate dye coupled with an optical microcavity has reached 0.1 @xcite . in this case , the counter - rotating wave terms ( crt ) of the interaction can not be neglected and result in bloch - siegert ( b - s ) shift of the resonant frequency , which has been observed recently in the experiment @xcite .",
    "therefore , the interaction of matter and cavity field is then governed by the rabi model beyond the rwa . because of the difficulties to obtain the exact solution of rabi model ,",
    "some approximate analytical and numerical approaches have been proposed and the b - s shift in atomic and superconducting qubit cavity qed have been studied @xcite .",
    "for the strong coupled polar molecule cavity qed system , the contribution of pdm should be considered on the base of crt @xcite .",
    "because the jc - type hamiltonian can be solved analytically in a closed form in the basis of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( where the qubit states @xmath9 and @xmath10 are excited state and ground state respectively , and the oscillator states @xmath11 are fock states ) in terms of dressed - states @xcite , we can treat the contribution of pdm and crt as a perturbation of interaction . in our work , a dressed - state perturbation theory ( dsp ) beyond the rwa is proposed to treat analytically a two - level polar molecule coupled to a quantized cavity field .",
    "based on our dsp theory , the b - s shift in the polar molecule cavity qed system is also obtained , which includes the contribution of both crt and pdm separately . the b - s shift caused by",
    "the crt is approximately proportional to the square of the coupling strength , while the b - s shift caused by the pdm is proportional to the square of the normalized permanent dipole difference and dependent on the higher terms of @xmath3 , which is coincident with ref .",
    "in addition , for the transition between the higher excited state and the ground state , the magnitude of the bs shift becomes larger as energy level increases .",
    "also , our method could be extended to the solution of two - level atom rabi model hamiltonian beyond the rwa by setting normalized permanent dipole difference equals zero .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we present the dsp theory and derive analytical expressions for the eigenenergies and eigenstates of a two - level polar molecule cavity qed system . the validity of our approach up to second - order correction is also given . in sec .",
    "3 , we show the transition relation between different energy levels through their populations , and the respective contribution of pdm and crt to the transition is given as well .",
    "in addition , by comparing the energy spectrum obtained by our approach with those by numerical simulation , we furthermore clarify the validity of our method .",
    "the respective effect of pdm and crt on the energy level shift are also analyzed .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . 4 .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the coupling of electronic transition ( such as alkaline earth monohalides @xcite , alkaline earth monohydrides @xcite , alkaline monohydrides @xcite , giant dipole diphenyl molecules @xcite etc . ) with the visible laser field . as for the coupling of vibrational transition or rotational transition of polar molecule with cavity field , which are not dealt with here",
    ", they will be discussed in our future work .",
    "when the frequency of the relevant cavity mode @xmath4 is near resonant with a polar molecule s transition frequency @xmath12 between electronic ground state and excited state , the dynamics of the molecule is restricted to the two state @xmath13 , and the molecule is well approximated by a two - level system .",
    "the interaction between a two - level polar molecule and a quantized cavity field with frequency @xmath4 is described by @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the creation and annihilation operators of a photon , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are pauli spin operators , and we have set @xmath19 to unity .",
    "the ground state and excited state of the polar molecule have permanent dipole moments @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "@xmath22 is the transition dipole moment .",
    "@xmath23 is the normalized permanent dipole difference .",
    "@xmath24 is the coupling strength , where @xmath25 is the cavity mode volume .",
    "the specific parameters of permanent dipole moment @xmath20 and @xmath21 , transition dipole moment @xmath22 , and transition frequency @xmath12 are given in the specific molecule references .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian can be divided into two parts : @xmath26 consisting of @xmath27 and @xmath28,\\ ] ] where the first part @xmath29 is the jc model hamiltonian within the rwa , whose eigenvalues and eigenstates are exactly solvable in terms of dressed - states , and the second part @xmath30 involves the interaction hamiltonian of both the pdm and the crt . if @xmath30 is a very small quantity compared with @xmath29 , then we can treat @xmath30 as a perturbation part , and derive approximated solution of eigenvalue and eigenfunction of @xmath31 .",
    "the validity of the dsp theory is discussed later in the paper .",
    "first , we can obtain energy eigenstates of the unperturbed system through the diagonalization of non - perturbation part hamiltonian @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , detuning @xmath36 , rabi frequency @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies are : @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is also a eigenstate of @xmath29 with eigenenergy @xmath40 .",
    "these energy eigenstates form a orthogonal and normalized completed set : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "since these unperturbed eigenstates are completed , the explicit state @xmath44 of @xmath31 can be expanded in terms of the eigenfunction set as : @xmath45 the detailed description of dressed - state perturbation theory is given in appendix a.    suppose that the system is in one of the eigenstates @xmath46 ( or @xmath39 ) before being perturbed , which means that zero - order approximated wave function is @xmath47 ( or @xmath39 ) and zero - order approximated energy is @xmath48 ( or @xmath40 ) .",
    "based on the framework of perturbation theory , analytical approximations for the wave function and the energy of dressed - state after being perturbed can be performed systematically .",
    "the ground - state wave function and energy can be obtained as ( all of them are up to the second - order correction ) : @xmath49    @xmath50    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "also , the excited - state wave functions and energy spectrums can be given by :    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath47 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath48 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ,    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath66\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath67\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath68\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    all of above results can be obtained by straight but complex calculation , and the detailed expression of ground state wavefunction @xmath69 is given in appendix b. of course , according to the similar procedure , we can also get the wave function of the higher order dressed - state @xmath70 , but not all of them are shown here , and only the first - order wavefunction correction @xmath71 are shown in appendix c. in all of these analytical expressions , @xmath72 correspond to the contribution of pdm of polar molecule , @xmath73 @xmath74 correspond to the contribution of crt , and @xmath75 correspond to the combined contribution of both the pdm and the crt . where the first - order wavefunction correction @xmath76 are proportional to @xmath77 , and the first - order energy correction @xmath78 equals zero ; while the second - order wavefunction and energy correction @xmath79 are proportional to @xmath80 , and @xmath75 are proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath81 , all of these results reduce to those of two - level atom rabi model case , hence the dsp theory is also a new analytical method to treat atom rabi model .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss the validity of our approach .",
    "the definite meaning of a small @xmath30 is that the matrix element of perturbation operator between the perturbing state @xmath82 and the unperturbed state @xmath46 should be much smaller than the energy difference between the two states : @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the power series of @xmath84 and @xmath44 will convergence quickly , and we only need to calculate the first few terms to obtain quite accurate results . through calculation , our dsp theory up to second - order correction is valid in a certain range of both normalized coupling strength @xmath85 and @xmath77 value : @xmath86 in the resonant case , and the range of validity of @xmath77 narrows as @xmath87 value increases .",
    "in addition , we focus on coherent coupling here in this dsp theory , and the involvement of decay of both cavity field and the molecule will be discussed in our future paper .",
    "in this section we will discuss the effect of pdm on the energy level and population of the system .",
    "the energy levels of the system are displayed in fig .",
    "the first column stands for the uncoupled stystem , while the second column stands for the dressed energy levels for the unperturbed system under the rwa , and the third column stands for the dressed energy levels for the perturbed system beyond the rwa .",
    "suppose the system is in one of the eigenstates before being perturbed , for example in the ground state @xmath39 , under the framework of the rwa , the ground state of the system is always uncoupled from other states and thereby remains unchanged .",
    "yet when the crts and pdm are involved in the treatment , the ground state will always overlap with the upper level and the photon in the ground state is no longer in a vacuum state , but now contains molecule - cavity coupling @xcite . under first - order perturbation ,",

    "@xmath109 and a wide range of detuning values @xmath144 , our analytical results agree well with the direct numerical simulation .",
    "it implies that our presented dsp theory is valid for the current experimental conditions with strong coupling . from the expression of the wave function , we could clearly obtain the population of the different dressed - state energy level and the transition relation between the energy levels .",

    "furthermore , both the crt and the pdm result in the energy shift of the dressed states from those of the jc model hamiltonian , and the energy shift caused by the crt is approximately proportional to the square of coupling strength , while the energy shift caused by the pdm is proportional to the square of normalized permanent dipole difference and dependent on the higher terms of coupling strength . for giant dipole molecule cavity qed",

    "in addition , much theoretical and experimental attention has been devoted to the effect of the counter - rotating wave terms , which plays an important role in the strong - coupling regime and result in some novel quantum mechanical phenomena , for instance , the modification of dynamics of population inversion @xcite , preparing non - classical state @xcite , quantum irreversibility and chaos @xcite , quantum phase transition @xcite , the simulation of dynamical casimir effect in semiconductor microcavity or superconducting circuit qed @xcite , and the production of photon from vacuum @xcite etc .",
    "comparing the contribution of permanent dipole moment with that of the counter - rotating wave terms will lead to beneficial discussion , and we will work on it in the future paper .",
