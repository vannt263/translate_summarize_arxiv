    "with the high spatial resolution of chandra and ground - based infrared ( ir ) instrumentation , the galactic center , heavily obscured by dust , is now accessible to a wide range of astrophysical investigations . a series of chandra observations of the gcr ( @xmath210@xmath3 region around sgra * ) , totaling 670 ksec ,",
    "have recently been analyzed by @xcite(hereafter , m03 ) , revealing 2357 point sources .",
    "the 2 - 8 kev x - ray luminosity ( @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) and spectral index ( @xmath6 ) of the majority of the sources are inconsistent with normal stars , active binaries , or young stellar objects , none of which are normally persistently luminous enough at @xmath72.5 kev to produce the observed fluxes in the presence of the high absorption column ( n@xmath8 ) .",
    "the only known sources expected to be detected given the absorption are compact objects accreting from binary companions .",
    "the luminosity range of the gcr sources covers magnetic cvs and non - roche - lobe filling hmxbs accreting in a low mass - transfer regime , e.g.  x  per , a0535 + 26 @xcite .",
    "quiescent low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) with neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) primaries are possible contributors but are generally too faint ( bhs ) or too soft ( nss ) .",
    "hmxbs are young objects ( few my ) , while cvs are slow to form and long - lived .",
    "the two possibilities point to different evolutionary phases of the gcr .",
    "if hmxbs comprise a significant fraction of the gcr sources , they must be the products of recent , massive - star formation .",
    "frequent star - burst events in the gcr are expected on @xmath220 my scales based upon the instability of large gas clouds orbiting within 200pc of the nucleus @xcite and the presence of several young clusters of massive stars .",
    "the hmxb hypothesis was proposed and discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the galactic bulge contains the debris of tidally - disrupted globular clusters .",
    "were the gcr sources dominated by magnetic cvs , globular clusters would then contribute because cvs are over - produced per unit mass in globulars relative to the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite proposed a third scenario in which compact stellar remnants form in the galactic bulge and sink toward the center of the dense mass distribution via gravitational interactions .",
    "the presence of a super - massive black hole ( bh ) at the center accelerates the process , leading to a central density cusp .",
    "this scenario fits with the @xcite ( m05 ) discovery of a centrally concentrated overabundance of x - ray transients , as well as the overall 1/@xmath9 source distribution found by m03 .",
    "all three channels may be active now or have been in the past , so by measuring relative numbers of the various end - products , we hope to piece together the composition and history of the gcr . in this letter we present preliminary results of our deep ir survey targeted at measuring the hmxb fraction .",
    "the occurrence of ir counterparts consistent with highly reddened massive stars and giants will constrain the relative abundance of hmxbs and cvs .",
    "this work is part of our chandra multi - wavelength plane survey ( champlane : @xcite ) which is an effort to map the space density of all types of low - luminosity accretion sources in the galaxy .",
    "the gcr is heavily obscured with average a@xmath10@xmath225 so counterparts can only be detected with ir imaging .",
    "the stellar density is also very high so that reaching a sufficient limiting magnitude to make meaningful constraints on population models demands excellent image quality . in june 2004",
    "we observed the inner 10@xmath3x10@xmath3 of the gcr with the panic imager on the 6.5 m magellan ( baade ) telescope at las campanas , chile .",
    "panic has a 2@xmath3x2@xmath3 field of view with 0.125@xmath11 pixels . under good seeing conditions ( median fwhm @xmath2 0.5@xmath11 )",
    ", we obtained a mosaic of 25 pointings in j , h , ks , and br@xmath12 filters using a 5-point dither pattern with 3 exposures at each position .",
    "sky emission was removed using off - source exposures , and the images were reduced and stacked in iraf .",
    "photometry was performed on the stacked images using sextractor @xcite .",
    "astrometric and photometric calibration were performed using the 2mass point - source catalog .",
    "we used a version of x - ray point source catalog of m03 , kindly provided by m. muno , listing j2000 co - ordinates with net count rate , flux , and source significance determined in 3 energy bands s1 ( 0.3 - 1.2kev ) , s2 ( 1.2 - 2.5 kev ) , and h ( 2.5 - 8 kev ) .",
    "the intermediate s2 band provides some additional information , but for this letter we restrict ourselves to discussion of gcr ( h only ) and foreground ( s1 ) sources .",
    "we set out to identify all potential ir counterparts to the m03 x - ray sources and apply statistical tests to measure their numbers relative to random positional coincidence .",
    "our scientific goals are to set stringent upper - limits on the number of counterparts and examine their photometric properties .",
    "the availability of x - ray spectral information and multi - band ir photometry permits a clean separation of sources situated in the gcr from those in the foreground .",
    "the gcr sources are characterized by x - ray spectra completely cut off at low energies due to absorbing gas and dust . of the sources in the m03 catalog , 80%",
    "are detected at @xmath73@xmath13 in the h band only , while any source detected in the s1 band must lie in the foreground .",
    "the spatial distributions of x - ray point sources and k - band stars follow similar radial profiles about the gcr .",
    "m03 demonstrated a surface density with 1/@xmath9 dependence with angular offset @xmath9 from sgra*. similar results have been reported for stars from ir observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are @xmath2100 known galactic hmxbs , of which 70% have be star companions whose spectral types lie in the narrow range o9-b2 and peak at b0v @xcite .",
    "we adopt the luminosity and color of a b0v to represent `` typical '' hmxb values ( @xmath14=@xmath154 , v@xmath15k=@xmath150.83 ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that many non - be hmxbs are _ more _ luminous because they have super - giant companions . for the cv case",
    ", we adopt a k0v dwarf ( m@xmath10=5.9,v@xmath15k=1.96 ) at the brighter end of the normal range @xcite . adopting @xmath16=25 and @xmath17=8 kpc for the gcr",
    ", our target hmxb should have an apparent magnitude k=14.4 while the assumed cv would have k=21 .",
    "we note the intermediate polar gk per with bright sub - giant counterpart would have k@xmath219 .",
    "due to severe crowding in the gcr , we infer the star density from our observations by correcting for incompleteness i.e. the loss of faint stars due to their brighter neighbors .",
    "completeness curves for our panic photometry as functions of magnitude and distance from sgra * were determined by simulation . for each of the 25 k - band stacked images , a random sample of stars",
    "was added using iraf _ mkstar _ with a gaussian psf matched to the seeing .",
    "the photometry was repeated and the artificial stars identified and compared to their input magnitudes .",
    "a master catalog of input and recovered stars was then assembled , from which completeness curves could be extracted for any region of the 10@xmath3x10@xmath3 mosaic .",
    "the 50% completeness limit ( fraction of stars recovered within @xmath180.5 mag of their input magnitude ) within the inner 1@xmath3 radius occurs at k=14.5 and over the rest of the mosaic at k=15.4 .",
    "curves for star density are presented in figure  [ fig : photcom ] and completeness values for the full field reported in the final column of table  [ tab : peakupresults ] .",
    "the ir and x - ray catalogs are repeatedly matched over a large grid of positional offsets using integer multiples of the panic pixel - size of 0.125@xmath11 . at each offset position ,",
    "the number of x - ray sources with one or more stars lying in their error - circle is recorded in a series of magnitude bins .",
    "we used 95% confidence error - circles determined from the formula of @xcite which is dependent on net counts and distance from the chandra aimpoint . for the gcr sources , error radii are 0.3@xmath11 - 1@xmath11",
    "the presence of real counterparts is signaled by a peak at the offset co - ordinates corresponding to perfect alignment of the two catalogs , providing a boresight . to confirm that x - ray and ir catalogs are on the same astrometric frame we centroided the soft - source peak , finding a residual offset of @xmath19ra=0.011(1)@xmath11 , @xmath19dec=0.092(1)@xmath11 with fwhm=0.55@xmath11 .    the number of random matches ( @xmath20 ) is calculated as the mean of all trials at shifts greater than 2@xmath11 , i.e. far away from correct alignment , and the standard deviation ( @xmath13 ) of these values is used to characterize the uncertainty .",
    "we then take the ( peak ) number of matches ( @xmath21 ) , and subtract the random level to obtain the excess - above - random ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we claim detection of a population of counterparts above that predicted to occur by chance if @xmath22 exceeds @xmath23 . the upper - limit on the total number of true counterparts",
    "was determined by monte - carlo simulation . at each iteration",
    "the x - ray catalog was offset by randomly generated shifts in x and y such that the absolute shift was between 2@xmath11 and 5@xmath11 .",
    "a randomly selected sample of @xmath24 x - ray sources were flagged as `` true counterparts '' and the catalogs matched as previously described . since all of the x / ir matches were by definition random ( due to the offsets ) we were able to count the total number of matches @xmath25 in each magnitude bin , correcting for duplicates ( sources flagged as simulated matches which also happened to have a random ir counterpart ) such that @xmath25 = @xmath20 + @xmath24 - @xmath26 .",
    "guided by the values of @xmath13 from the peakup test , we ran simulations with @xmath24=5 - 40 with 100 iterations at each value . for each value of @xmath24",
    "we recorded the largest value of @xmath25 reached in 90% of trials , and fitted the results with a straight line relationship .",
    "thus the upper - limit on the number of true matches corresponds to the value of @xmath24 when @xmath25 = @xmath21 , these values are given in table  [ tab : peakupresults ] as @xmath27 .",
    "we performed the peak - up test first on the entire field , and then independently on a series of concentric annular regions centered on sgra*. this allows us to limit the effects of crowding in the ir , and to follow the cusp distribution of hard x - ray sources .    for the full field we found no significant excess in the number of ir matches for hard x - ray sources , irrespective of magnitude , while for soft sources we found a highly significant ( @xmath230@xmath13 ) counterpart population dominated by bright ( k@xmath211 ) stars .",
    "this result is illustrated visually by figure  [ fig : peakup ] and in more detail in table  [ tab : peakupresults ] .",
    "there is a marginal signal ( @xmath28 ) for hard sources versus the entire panic catalog , which could not be associated with any specific magnitude range .",

    ", our results constrain the hmxb population as a function of distance from sgra*. the effect of the nuclear cluster is apparent in the inner 1@xmath3 , where a large number of massive stars raise the upper - limits such that k@xmath115 hmxb can potentially account for 9% of the 110 hard x - ray sources present ( at 90% confidence ) .",
    "the limit is 5 - 8% for the remaining annuli .",
    "overall the annular results are less constraining than the full field results due to the smaller sample sizes involved .",
    "a single annular bin ( 2@xmath3 - 3@xmath3 ) produced a peak at 3.8@xmath13 significance , possibly corresponding to a drop in the confusion limit sufficient to allow counterparts to be isolated .",

    "this result is consistent with the x - ray selection and peak - up test , the soft sources are shown to lie in the foreground , while the hard sources are dominated by random matches to stars in the gcr .",

    "it is also possible that these matches are random and the real counterparts are much fainter .",
    "no match was found for the 7 bright transients detected by m05 .    a preliminary search for br@xmath12 emission objects among x - ray ir counterparts yielded 11 candidates with s / n@xmath75 ,",
    "of which 3 are foreground objects .",
    "br@xmath12k is severely restricted by the small amplitude of the expected signal ( @xmath2 - 0.1 mag for ew(br@xmath12)@xmath210 - 20 ) and the effects of crowding .",
    "the highly absorbed gcr x - ray sources appear to be dominated by a population of accreting binaries in which the mass - donor is less massive than in a typical hmxb .",
    "this conclusion follows from the lack of a significant excess of stars brighter than k@xmath3615 in the error circles of hard x - ray sources , which is the apparent magnitude of a b0v star at the distance and mean av of the gcr . by applying our peak - up test as a function of magnitude and distance from sgra * , and correcting for completeness , we set 90% confidence upper limits on the number of hard x - ray sources that can have counterparts in a series of ranges between k=9 - 16 .",
    "after accumulating these limits for all counterparts brighter than k=15 , such stars can account for at most 79 out of 1453 hard x - ray sources , or 5.4% .",
    "pushing one magnitude fainter to include be hmxbs as late as b2 , we find an upper - limit of 103 or 7.1% . within 1@xmath3 of sgra * these upper - limits become 9% and 15% due to the high density of very luminous stars in the nuclear cluster .",
    "we note that large variations in a@xmath37 and/or star clustering could modify these numbers .",
