    "we focus on the four main schemes for complete qpt .",

    "the idea comes from the isomorphism between operators and quantum states , and the scheme also relies on state tomography . to determine all qp parameters",

    "f of this supplementary information .      direct characterization of qp @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the error correction theory .",
    "it requires an ancillary quantum system and @xmath123 different entangled input states of the combined system , with @xmath124 being a prime number .",
    "the measurements are performed jointly , in entangled bases .",
    "selective and efficient qpt @xcite .",
    "suppose the process @xmath0 is written as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a basis of operators .",
    "the success of this scheme relies on a fact that @xmath127 , where the summation is over all input states that form a 2-design , which has about @xmath77 elements . to obtain @xmath128 ,",
    "the input state @xmath129 should be acted upon by one of the four extra standard channels @xmath130 and @xmath131 before undergoing the process @xmath0 , and finally the output state should be projected onto the set of input states @xmath129 .    for the physical resources , the numbers of different input states in scheme ( a ) and ( d ) are of order @xmath122 , much larger than that of ours .",
    "the input states required in schemes ( b ) and ( c ) are much more difficult to prepare",
    ". additionally , scheme ( c ) works only when @xmath124 is a prime ; otherwise , one should embed the system in a larger hilbert space whose dimension is a prime number .    as to parallelism , the numbers of setups required for schemes ( a)-(c ) are @xmath78 , @xmath78 @xcite and @xmath77 @xcite , respectively . scheme ( d )",
    "is designed especially for partial qpt and different strategies are needed to determine different qp parameters .",
    "but for a complete qpt , scheme ( d ) requires @xmath79 setups @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our scheme requires only @xmath124 setups ( for preparation of the @xmath124 different initial states ) .",
    "then let us consider data processing and error accumulation . in schemes ( a ) and ( b ) , the qp parameters are related to all the experimental values via a @xmath132 matrix @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath75 to roughly denote each systematical error produced in the experimental operations , including the state preparation and measurements . in schemes",
    "( a ) , the systematic errors of an expectation value arise from input - state preparation and the performance of the projective measurements ; in scheme ( b ) the errors of one expectation value arise from the two measurements performed on the principal and the ancillary systems .",
    "so the error of each estimated parameter @xmath133 in both schemes originates from @xmath134 terms , i.e. , @xmath135 . in scheme ( c ) , the @xmath122 diagonal qp parameters can be directly obtained , but the @xmath78 non - diagonal parameters are related in a complex way to outcomes of the joint measurements performed on @xmath136 non - maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "preparation of the entangled states and the collective measurements on the composite system are more vulnerable to errors . in scheme ( d ) , to give one qp parameter , @xmath77 different input states and four extra standard qps are required . neglecting the possible imperfections of extra qps",
    ", the accumulated error can be expressed as @xmath81 . in our qpt scheme ,",
    "we have presented in the main text that @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , our scheme has an advantage over the other schemes with respect to the robustness against error accumulation .      as weak measurements are the building blocks of our main scheme , the couplings between the pointers and the system should be weak .",
    "however , for both theoretical and practical significance , it is interesting to discuss the cases when the couplings are not weak",
    ".    actually , for the case of strong couplings , we still have a qpt scheme if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are both projective operators . in this case",

    "<S> high - precision operations in quantum information processing and quantum control vitally depend on the faithfulness of quantum devices . </S>",
    "<S> how to completely characterize quantum dynamic evolutions within the quantum devices is the task of quantum process tomography ( qpt ) , which is a topic of essential importance . </S>",
    "<S> many theoretical and experimental works on qpt have been done @xcite .    a quantum process ( qp ) @xmath0 can be viewed as a linear super - operator that maps a state @xmath1 on the input hilbert space @xmath2 ( of dimension @xmath3 ) to the state @xmath4 on the output hilbert space @xmath5 ( of dimension @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> to express it explicitly , we choose two sets of basis states @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath2 , and two sets of basis states @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a qp @xmath0 ( more generally , any linear super - operator ) is associated with an operator @xmath11 , and it maps an arbitrary operator @xmath12 on @xmath2 to an operator on @xmath5 : @xmath13 $ ] , with the trace taken over the input hilbert space only , i.e. , @xmath14 when the four sets of basis states are chosen , the quantum process @xmath0 is completely defined by the @xmath15 complex parameters @xmath16 , which need to satisfy certain conditions to ensure that the linear map defined in ( [ processdefinition ] ) is a completely positive map and @xmath4 is really a density matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> tomography of an unknown qp @xmath0 is , therefore , to determine all the coefficients @xmath16 with respect to the chosen bases , such that one can predict the output state for any input state . to accomplish it , the existing schemes @xcite generally require measurements of many non - commuting observables and a large number of different input states , and thus become impractical when the dimension of the quantum system increases .    </S>",
    "<S> a qpt scheme provides a way to express the qp parameters in terms of expectation values of some observables , which can be directly obtained from experiments . </S>",
    "<S> so we consider a qpt scheme  </S>",
    "<S> more direct if it requires fewer expectation values to determine a single qp parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we seek a qpt scheme that establishes a direct connection between the qp parameters and the experimental expectation values . </S>",
    "<S> such a direct scheme is efficient when applied to partial qpt : to obtain a single or a few parameters of the qp , one needs to perform only the relevant measurements instead of all the measurements required for a complete tomography of all the parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage is that a direct scheme is also robust against the accumulation of errors as it relates a qp parameter to fewer experimental expectation values .    </S>",
    "<S> generally , a qpt scheme requires various input states , and on each input state some non - commuting observables should be measured . </S>",
    "<S> these non - compatible measurements can not be performed simultaneously , i.e. , can not be performed in a single experimental setup . from one setup to another , the experimenters have to change and recalibrate the devices . </S>",
    "<S> hence for a qpt scheme , the number of setups closely relates to the efficiency of a complete tomography . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the standard qpt scheme @xcite one setup gives only one expectation value , and as such , even for the tomography of asimple two - qubit gate , it requires about @xmath17 different setups . to improve the efficiency , it is desirable to make the measurements compatible , so that much more expectation values can be obtained simultaneously in a single setup </S>",
    "<S> in another word , the expectation values required to determine qp parameters should be obtained in parallel , not in sequence . </S>",
    "<S> such a feature is referred to as  parallelism . </S>",
    "<S> more parallel a qpt scheme is , fewer setups it requires . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , as a quantification of parallelism , the number of setups required in a qpt scheme also depends on the number of different input states , since different states need different methods to prepare .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we shall present a direct and parallel qpt scheme via weak measurements , which has already been demonstrated and used for various purposes theoretically and experimentally @xcite , including the characterization of quantum states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme is direct since a single qp parameter is determined by only five expectation values , regardless of the dimension of the quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> it is parallel because the scheme requires only @xmath3 experimental setups . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme also has a simple input state preparation , we need only @xmath3 different input states , and for the tomography of multi - particle processes we just need product input states .     </S>",

    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we choose a system of dimension @xmath3 and prepare it in a state @xmath25 , then weakly couple it with a pointer labeled by the letter@xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> then , the system weakly interacts with a second pointer ( labeled by  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 ) , the evolution is described by @xmath30 where a small @xmath31 is chosen to ensure a weakened interaction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a projection @xmath26 ( thepost - selection ) is performed on the system . </S>",
    "<S> we use the notation @xmath32 to denote this particular set of actions on the system .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , suppose that the pointers  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19  and@xmath20  are initially prepared in the same state @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we also suppose that the average values of two non - commuting observables @xmath34 and @xmath35 of each pointer are initially zero , i.e. , @xmath36 . for each pointer </S>",
    "<S> , we can read out either its @xmath34 or @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there are four possible products of pointer shifts , and we define their averages as : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for each set @xmath32 of actions on the system . these @xmath41-values can be directly obtained from the experiments .    for this unknown process @xmath0 , the initial state @xmath25 of the system and the final post - selection @xmath26 , we can define an@xmath24-value  of @xmath22 and @xmath23 as    @xmath42\\end{aligned } \\label{eq : define x-1}\\ ] ]    in the supplementary information , we show that when the set of actions for the system is @xmath32 , the @xmath24-value @xmath43 is related to the corresponding four @xmath41-values , via @xmath44\\label{x - r - relation}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the probability of the post - selection @xmath26 , which can be obtained by statistics , and both @xmath46 and @xmath47 depend only on the initial state of the pointers . </S>",

    "<S> conditional on the final post - selected state @xmath63 , we average the four possible products of pointer shifts to obtain the @xmath41-values , from which the @xmath24-value @xmath64 can also be obtained easily via ( [ x - r - relation ] ) . in supplementary information , we show that @xmath65 the denominator in equation ( [ chi - x-1-relation ] ) is fixed when the bases are fixed .    to determine all the qp parameters , our scheme requires @xmath3 different input states @xmath66 which compose an orthonormal basis in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when the qp is a multi - particle one , we only need to prepare the multi - particle system in product states , because we can choose a set of product basis states to write the qp parameters as in equation ( [ processdefinition ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the final post - selection in our scheme is a complete projective measurement onto the basis @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to many other applications of weak measurements , we do not throw away any data via post - selection , and all data are used for tomography .    </S>",
    "<S> we also need weak measurements of @xmath3 different observables @xmath68 on the input system , and weak measurements of @xmath6 different observables @xmath69 on the system output from the unknown qp . </S>",
    "<S> all of these observables can be measured simultaneously in one setup as the change of system state due to each weak measurement is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that coupling constants of all the weak measurements have the same order of @xmath70 , then the principal contributions to an @xmath41-value of two pointers that associate with observables @xmath22 and @xmath23 are of order @xmath71 , while the influence to it caused by an additional pointer is of order @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this result also ensures that we can introduce two pointers to weakly measure a same observable , and finally read out the @xmath34 shift of one pointer and the @xmath35 shift of the other pointer . </S>",
    "<S> these features are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . in such a way , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath73 @xmath41-values that correspond to one specific input state , the @xmath3 observables on @xmath2 , the @xmath6 observables on @xmath5 and the @xmath6 post - selected states , can be obtained in a single experimental setup . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 qp parameters can be determined simultaneously . </S>",

    "<S> immediately , it leads to the fact that our scheme is very efficient for partial qpt , in which not all qp parameters are of interest . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the direct relation established by our scheme could sharply reduce the accumulation of experimental systematic errors , which may lead to a non - physical reconstruction of the unknown qp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath75 to roughly denote each systematical error produced in the experimental operations , including the state preparation and measurements . </S>",
    "<S> then for our qpt scheme , it can be shown from equation ( [ eq : define x-1 ] ) and equation ( [ chi - x-1-relation ] ) that the accumulated systematic error is given as @xmath76 . </S>",

    "<S> the accumulated error of one qp parameter is generally @xmath81 or @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of different input states required by them is generally @xmath77 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although in some schemes the number of input states is of the same order with ours @xcite , an ancilla system has to be introduced , and the initial states must be correlated states of the combined system , which are much more difficult to prepare . in the supplemental material </S>",
