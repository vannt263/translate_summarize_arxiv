    "consider a two - point boundary value problem on the interval @xmath0\\subset \\mathbb{r}$ ] , @xmath1 with boundary conditions @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the standard central difference approximation with a uniform mesh may be used to approximate solutions to ( [ bvp1 ] ) . in particular , let @xmath4 be a positive integer , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "setting @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the discretization of ( [ bvp1 ] ) takes the form of the system @xmath10 : @xmath11 a solution @xmath12 of ( [ bvp1 ] ) may then be approximated by an @xmath4-tuple of real numbers @xmath13 such that @xmath14 for @xmath15 .    depending upon the nonlinearity @xmath16 , equation ( [ bvp1 ] )",
    "may have no solutions , a unique solution , multiple solutions , or even infinitely many solutions .",
    "there are many existence theorems for solutions of such equations subject to growth conditions on @xmath16 , but even when existence is known , the number of solutions often is not .",
    "furthermore , a discretization such as @xmath10 may have spurious solutions that do not converge to a solution to ( [ bvp1 ] ) as @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath16 is sufficiently smooth , a solution @xmath18 to ( [ bvp1 ] ) is eventually approximated with @xmath19 accuracy on the mesh by some solution @xmath20 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a relatively secure numerical technique for finding the solutions of a general class of two - point boundary value problems without requiring highly refined meshes .",
    "the technique involves performing successive homotopy deformations between discretizations with increasingly many mesh points , as suggested in @xcite . by restricting our attention to problems having polynomial nonlinearity , including the case of a polynomial approximation to a smooth nonlinearity",
    ", we can often assure that all solutions are found at each stage of the algorithm .",
    "even when we do not guarantee all solutions , our method generates multiple solutions that in test cases include approximations to all known solutions . while grbner basis methods ( see @xcite ) or cellular exclusion methods ( see @xcite ) could be applied to solve the polynomial discretizations , we chose to use homotopy continuation due to its ability to handle polynomial systems in many variables and the ease with which it allows us to generate solutions on a refined mesh from the solutions on the previous mesh .",
    "although other numerical methods treating two - point boundary value problems have been developed ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , such methods require satisfactory initial solution estimates .",
    "the present technique provides such initial estimates .",
    "here is a sketch of our bootstrapping process , which will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent section :    1 .",
    "find all solutions of the discretization @xmath10 for some small @xmath4 .",
    "the size of @xmath4 needs only to be large enough that the discretization is consistent ; it could be as small as @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   discard all unreasonable solutions , e.g. , solutions which do not possess properties which exact solutions may be known to have .",
    "let us denote the set of solutions which are kept by @xmath22 .",
    "3 .   if the mesh size is not yet sufficiently small or the cardinality of @xmath22 has not yet stabilized , add a mesh point to obtain the discretization @xmath23 . use the solutions in @xmath22 to generate solutions @xmath24 of @xmath23 and then return to step 2 .",
    "once the mesh size @xmath25 is sufficiently small and the cardinality of @xmath22 becomes stable , refine the solutions with a fast nonlinear solver , using starting values obtained by interpolating the solutions in @xmath22 .",
    "this paper focuses primarily on the implementation of step 3 of the above scheme .",
    "in particular , we consider the homotopy function @xmath26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 at @xmath28 this is the system @xmath23 . at @xmath29 ,",
    "it can be interpreted as the system @xmath10 with a new mesh point having the value @xmath30 at @xmath31 and a new right - hand boundary at @xmath32 having value @xmath33 .",
    "the incompatibility of the old boundary condition at @xmath31 and the new one at @xmath32 is accommodated by the presence of both @xmath30 and @xmath34 , which are not necessarily equal .",
    "as @xmath35 goes from 1 to 0 , the mesh points are squeezed back inside the interval @xmath0 $ ] , and the right - hand boundary condition @xmath3 is transferred from @xmath34 to @xmath36 as @xmath34 is forced to equal @xmath30 .",
    "to find solutions of @xmath23 , we use continuation to track solutions of @xmath37 as @xmath35 goes from 1 to 0 . at @xmath29",
    ", we have a list @xmath22 of solutions",
    "@xmath38 satisfying the first @xmath4 equations of @xmath37 , while the final equation is @xmath39 which is the only place where @xmath30 appears . for each solution of @xmath38 in @xmath22 , we may use this equation to find corresponding solution values for @xmath30 .",
    "these are the start points of continuation paths leading to solutions of @xmath23 .",
    "the framework above does not change in any of its essentials if we prescribe a different function for @xmath40 .",
    "for example , the constant function @xmath41 was used for all examples below .",
    "although other alternatives are theoretically feasible , none were tested .",
    "the essential feature of @xmath40 is that it goes to @xmath42 as @xmath35 goes to @xmath43 .    by the implicit function theorem",
    ", a nonsingular solution @xmath44 to @xmath45 will continue uniquely in the neighborhood of @xmath29 to a nonsingular solution path @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the path remains nonsingular all the way to @xmath28 , which is what we require to follow the path reliably with numerical continuation . to skirt this difficulty , as discussed in chapter 7 of @xcite , it is sufficient to insert a random @xmath49 into the homotopy to obtain the variant @xmath50 \\label{eq : hn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath51    the work of the second author was supported by the national science foundation under grant no .",

    "the work of the fourth author was supported by the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "let s specialize the homotopy of equation ( [ eq : hn1 ] ) to the case when @xmath52 is a real polynomial @xmath53 .",
    "then , the right - most term of the @xmath54 entry in @xmath55 becomes just @xmath56 .",
    "this restriction to the polynomial case allows us to conveniently obtain the start points for @xmath57 by solving the polynomial @xmath58 for @xmath30 given @xmath59 from the solutions in @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath60 .",
    "we see that , in general , over the complex numbers , we will obtain @xmath61 values of @xmath30 for every point in @xmath22 .",
    "suppose that at each stage of the algorithm these all continue to finite , nonsingular solutions of @xmath23 .",
    "then , the solution list @xmath22 will have @xmath62 entries .",
    "while this gives an exhaustive enumeration of the solutions of the discretized problem , the exponential growth in the length of the solution list can not be practically sustained as @xmath4 increases .",
    "however , it is often the case that most of the solutions at a given stage do not exhibit various properties required of solutions to the two - point boundary value problem at hand , leading to filtering rules .",
    "depending upon the problem at hand , there are a variety of filtering rules that may be implemented to determine which solutions in @xmath22 may be discarded as start solutions for the subsequent homotopy .    for small @xmath4 we can contemplate retaining all solutions .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether the above procedure is guaranteed to generate all solutions of the discretized system .",
    "the answer , in general , is no , but we can say that if @xmath22 has @xmath62 distinct , nonsingular solutions , then it is clear that all solutions have been found , as bzout s theorem states that this is the greatest number possible . indeed , for our test problems , we have found that this behavior is typical .    for larger @xmath4 ,",
    "a filter becomes necessary .",
    "one that is always available is to take the discretization of the derivative of @xmath63 of @xmath64 , and throw away @xmath65 for which this is large . to get the discretization",
    "we could use the central difference approximations @xmath66 and @xmath67 applied only at the mesh points @xmath68 .",
    "so we would throw away the point @xmath69 if @xmath70 for some @xmath71 .",
    "naturally , one drawback to such a filter is the need to specify @xmath72 .",
    "other filters may be derived from known properties of the solutions of the problem at hand .",
    "for example , it may be known that solutions are symmetric about @xmath73 , are always positive , oscillate with a specific period , or exhibit some other easily - detected behavior .",
    "for example , a filter based on symmetry is considered in section 3.2 .",
    "although one may be tempted to discard solutions having nonzero complex part , this is not a valid filtering rule .",
    "the problem in section 3.3 below has non - real solutions in @xmath22 that are tracked to real solutions in @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , it is possible that oscillating solutions may arise from a sequence of non - oscillating solutions and that similar problems may occur with other filters .",
    "thus , the use of filters may be computationally beneficial , but with it comes the risk of not finding all real solutions to the problem .",
    "thus we have the final version of the algorithm :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * algorithm 1 *    1 .   for @xmath74",
