    "has been widely studied both experimentally and theoretically because of its excellent dielectric properties , wide band gap , high melting point , _ etc . _",
    "moreover , has been proved to be one of the most promising high - dielectric - constant materials , due to its high formation heat and nice thermodynamic stability when it contacts indirectly with si  @xcite .",
    "it has also been used in optical  @xcite and protective coatings  @xcite . at atmospheric pressure , exists in three polymorphs when temperature changes  @xcite : monoclinic structure ( p21/c , c2h 5 ) at low temperatures , tetragonal ( p42/nmc , d4h 15 ) at temperature higher than @xmath8 , and finally , with increasing temperature over @xmath9 , the cubic fluorite ( fm3 m , oh 5 ) becomes stable .",
    "however , by rapid quenching or stabilizer addition , the cubic structure can be stabilized at low temperatures , e.g. , see refs .  .",
    "the electronic and structural properties of have been theoretically studied by the first - principles band structure calculation based on the density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "for example , the structure , vibration and lattice dielectric properties of have been investigated in the frame of the local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite .",
    "based on the abinit package , the born effective charge tensors , phonon frequencies and dielectric permittivity tensors in cubic and tetragonal phases are calculated by lda  @xcite . the full potential linearized augmented plane - wave method based on the wien2k code",
    "is also employed to study the structural and electronic properties in the cubic phase  @xcite .",
    "further , the spin - orbit effect is estimated within the framework of lda and gga  @xcite .",
    "the resulting band gap is about @xmath10 , still smaller than the experimental value ( @xmath2 )  @xcite , indicating that correlation effects in can not be ignored .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the band structures of by the gw approximation , where the self - energy of a many - body system is approximated in terms of the screened coulomb interaction ( w ) up to first order , and then correlation effects can be addressed to some extent .",
    "the resulting band gap value is @xmath11 .",
    "although the value is much closer to the experimental one , the gw method is highly cost in terms of numerical demands .",
    "another technique to include correlation effects with relatively less computational effort is the so - called lda+@xmath0 or gga+@xmath0 approach , in which the correlation effect is incorporated through the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath0  @xcite . as an approximation to gw ,",
    "gga(lda)+@xmath0 approach can reproduce experimental data as accurately as the hybrid functional approach but with much lower computational efforts  @xcite .",
    "it can give a qualitative improvement compared with the lda , not only for excited - state properties such as energy gaps , but also for ground - state properties such as magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters  @xcite .",
    "recently , a gga+@xmath0 approach for has been performed , where not only the on - site @xmath0 for ce @xmath12 electrons , but also for o @xmath5 electrons , are included  @xcite .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 is not unambiguous .",
    "though there are attempts to extract it from the first - principles calculations , it is nontrivial to determine its value a priori . hence , in practice , @xmath0 is often fitted to reproduce a certain set of experimental data , such as band gaps and structural properties .    in this paper , we use gga and gga+@xmath0 schemes formulated by loschen _",

    "@xcite , to calculate the lattice parameters , band structures , and optical properties of cubic ( c- ) .",
    "we find that the value of the band gap can be reproduced by introducing the on - site coulomb interactions of @xmath3 orbitals on hf atom ( @xmath4 ) and of @xmath5 orbitals on o atom ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we also notice that a shoulder structure below the main peak of the imaginary part of the dielectric constant remains even when @xmath4 and @xmath6 are introduced .",
    "this implies that the shoulder structure is robust against the change of band structure due to the coulomb interactions .",
    "we thus expect that the shoulder will appear in absorption measurements for pure c- .",
    "these findings imply that the gga+@xmath4+@xmath6 approach is a convenient and powerful method to calculate and predict the electronic structures and optical properties of wide - gap optical materials .",
    "density functional theory calculations are performed with plane - wave ultrasoft pseudopotential , by using gga with perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional and gga+@xmath0 approach as implemented in the castep code ( cambridge sequential total energy package )  @xcite .",
    "the ionic cores are represented by ultrasoft pseudopotentials for hf and o atoms . for hf",
    "atom , the configuration is [ xe]@xmath13 , where the @xmath14 and @xmath15 electrons are explicitly treated as valence electrons . for o atom , the configuration is [ he]@xmath16 , and valence electrons include @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the plane - wave cut off energy is @xmath19 . and",
    "the brillouin - zone integration is performed over the @xmath20 grid sizes using the monkorst - pack method for cubic structure optimization .",
    "this set of parameters assure the total energy convergence of @xmath21 , the maximum force of @xmath22 , the maximum stress of @xmath23 and the maximum displacement of @xmath24 .    in the following sections , we firstly optimize the geometry structure of c- by the gga method .",
    "using the optimized structure , we next introduce @xmath4 for hf @xmath3 orbitals and @xmath6 for o @xmath5 orbitals . comparing the numerical values of the band gap with the experimental one , we obtain the best values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the electronic structures and optical properties of c- are calculated by means of gga , without @xmath0 and with @xmath4+@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "comparison with available experimental data is presented .",

    "c- is fully characterized by a single lattice constant @xmath25 .",
    "the gga calculation of the perfect bulk c- is performed to determine an optimized @xmath25 in order to check the applicability and accuracy of the ultrasoft pseudopotential .",
    "the optimized @xmath25 is @xmath26 , in good agreement with other theoretical values  @xcite .",
    "the deviation from experimental values ( @xmath27  @xcite and @xmath28  @xcite ) is @xmath29% at most .",
    "hereafter , we use this optimized value of @xmath25 .     +    the band structure along high - symmetry directions of the brillouin zone and total density of states ( dos ) of c- are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the band structure in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] shows a direct band gap because the top of the valence bands and the bottom of the conduction bands are found at the same x point .",
    "the value of the band gap @xmath30 is around @xmath1 , much smaller than the experimental value @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the well - known underestimate of conduction - band energies in _ ab initio _ calculations : the dft results often undervalue the energy of @xmath3 orbitals of hf atom , lowering the bottom level of conduction bands . as a result , the band gap obtained by gga is lower than the experimental one .",
    "the total dos is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] .",
    "there are two parts in the valence band , namely , the lower region from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and the upper region from @xmath33 to @xmath34",
    ". figure  [ fig1d ] shows that the lower valence bands are predominantly composed of o @xmath35 , while the upper valence bands consist of o @xmath5 accompanied with hybridization with hf @xmath3 as shown in fig .  [ fig1c ] .",
    "the conduction bands below @xmath36 are mostly composed of hf @xmath3 with some amount of o @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 orbitals of hf atom also contribute to the conduction bands , though their values are small compared with @xmath3 states .",
    "dielectric function is obtained by taking into account of inter - band transitions .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the complex dielectric function as a function of photon energy .",
    "the real part of the dielectric function @xmath39 in the low energy increases with photon energy and gets maximum at @xmath40",
    ". then it drops sharply with photon energy to negative values and return back to positive later .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath41 shows a maximum at @xmath42 followed by two shoulder structures below the energy .",
    "the two shoulders may be related to dos in conduction bands at @xmath43 and @xmath44 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .",
    "our results of the dielectric function agree with other calculations for c-  @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitude of maximum value of @xmath41 ( @xmath45 ) is larger than an available experimental value ( @xmath46 ) of  @xcite .",
    "this disagreement will be resolved if the gap magnitude is reproduced by introducing the on - site coulomb interactions , as discussed below .      using the optimized lattice parameter , @xmath49",
    ", we calculate the band structure and dos of c- by changing @xmath4 for @xmath3 orbitals of hf atom .",
    "the band gap @xmath30 obtained from the band structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath30 firstly increases , and then drops with increasing @xmath4 , showing a maximum value ( @xmath50 ) at @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum value is smaller than the experimental one ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the saturation of @xmath30 with @xmath4 may be related to the approach of @xmath3 states toward @xmath37 and @xmath38 states , though microscopic mechanism is not yet fully understood .",
    "next , we introduce @xmath6 for @xmath5 orbital of o atom , while keeping @xmath52 .",
    "the result in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] shows that @xmath30 monotonically increases with @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the calculated band gap is @xmath55 , coinciding with the experiment one .",
    "there could of course exist different combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath6 which can reproduce the band gap .",
    "for example , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , the resulting band gap is @xmath58 , with similar optical properties in the low - energy regime . based on physical consideration with reference to other numerical results , here , we choose @xmath51 , @xmath54 as a typical representative and perform the gga+@xmath0 calculations .",
    "+    the resulting band structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] .",
    "the bottom of the conduction bands is moved to the g point .",
    "the band dispersions near the bottom shift to higher energy with the increase of @xmath4 and are reconstructed as compared with the dispersions in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] . as a result , the separated dos at @xmath43 and @xmath44 in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] merges to one sharp structure at @xmath59 in fig .",
    "[ fig4b ] .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig4c ] that the reconstruction is caused by the @xmath3 state of hf .",
    "the o @xmath5 states are also affected by the reconstruction through hybridization effect as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4d ] .",
    "we note that the band gap increases with increasing @xmath6 through such strong hybridization effect .",
    "+ @xmath6.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ fig5 ] shows the dielectric function .",
    "the real part @xmath39 exhibits a maximum at @xmath60 , corresponding to band edge reflection peak at @xmath61 in the reflection spectrum .",
    "the calculated static dielectric constant is @xmath62 , coinciding with the experimental value of monoclinic  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part @xmath41 shows a maximum at @xmath63 .",
    "the maximum value ( @xmath64 ) is very close to the experimental value ( @xmath46 )  @xcite , in contrast with the gga case as mentioned before .",
    "this improvement comes from the agreement of @xmath30 between the numerical and experimental values .",
    "another interesting observation in @xmath41 is the presence of a shoulder structure below the peak .",
    "it is remarkable that , even though the reconstruction of the band structure occurs near the bottom of the conduction band , the shoulder structure remains as is the case of the gga calculation .",
    "this implies the robustness of the shoulder structure in c- .",
    "therefore , we can expect that such a shoulder structure appears in the absorption spectrum in pure c- samples .",
    "other optical properties can be computed from the complex dielectric function  @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the refractive index of c- by gga+@xmath4+@xmath6 , including refractive coefficient @xmath65 and extinction coefficient @xmath66 .",
    "the results show that @xmath65 is @xmath67 , consistent with the experimental value of monoclinic , @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "the structure optimization of c- is performed by using first - principles gga and the resulting cell parameter of optimization structure is @xmath26 , consistent with the experimental value and other theoretical results . however , the numerical value of band gap is only @xmath1 , much lower than the experimental ones .",
    "the deviation can be resolved by introducing on - site coulomb interactions into @xmath3 orbital of hf atom ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 orbital of o atom ( @xmath6 ) at the same time .",
    "we obtain the best estimations of @xmath4 and @xmath6 for c- .",
