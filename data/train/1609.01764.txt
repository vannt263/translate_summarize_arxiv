    "many of these aspects of the modeling of eukaryotic cell shape and motility have been reviewed in two recent papers @xcite .    in this paper , we will take a minimalistic approach , focusing on two main aspects of cell motility : the cell shape , as determined by a force balance at the surface of the cell , and the cell s internal , chemical regulation of its direction , modeled by reaction - diffusion equations within the cell .",
    "this model can be characterized by a small number of unitless parameters  six physical and biochemical parameters , and a few others related to the numerical evaluation of the model .",
    "the relative simplicity of this model allows us to capture essential cell behaviors , but avoids the full parameter space of more detailed schemes .",
    "even with such a simple model , it is possible to create reasonable cell shapes , which can be regulated by both physical and chemical features . in addition , we show that both linear and circular crawling trajectories can be observed .",
    "we argue that the circular trajectories arise from a coupling between cell shape and the internal chemical polarity of the cell , and suggest that these effects should be visible in a broad variety of models for cell polarity .",
    "our results may provide some insight into recent experiments linking cell turning events and cell speed @xcite .",
    "we model the cell s boundary as an interface with a tension applied to it , driven by actin polymerization at the front of the cell and myosin - based contraction at the cell rear . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the membrane s bending modulus ; including it is straightforward @xcite , but we have found it does not qualitatively chage our results .",
    "the cell front and rear are characterized by the distribution of a membrane - bound rho gtpase @xmath0 ( a polarity protein ) , whose dynamics are given by a variant of the simple wave - pinning reaction - diffusion model established by mori et al .",
    "we assume that the motion of the cell membrane is overdamped , i.e. obeying a force balance @xmath1 .",

    "similar assumptions are used in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a cell pushing out at the front , where @xmath5 and contracting at the back , where @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is thus a measure of protrusiveness and @xmath8 a measure of contractility .",
    "we assume that the membrane has a tension @xmath9 ( a line tension , since we are working in two dimensions ) , and thus exerts a force per unit length of @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the local curvature of the membrane .",
    "we assume a fluid - like friction , proportional to the velocity @xmath12 of the cell boundary , @xmath13 we will solve the combined force balance equation at the interface , @xmath14 , by casting it into a phase field form @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used to extensively model both single and collective cell dynamics over the past few years @xcite ; our model follows our earlier work , particularly @xcite .",
    "we will describe the cell boundary by a field @xmath15 , where @xmath16 smoothly varies from zero outside of the cell to unity inside the cell ; this variation has a characteristic length scale @xmath17 .",

    "we have used tildes @xmath22 to indicate a unitful variable ; we will later rescale them to unitless variables and drop the tildes to reduce the number of characteristic parameters involved .    to determine the direction the cell travels , we model the dynamics of a rho gtpase , which will be a polarity marker indicating the front of the cell",

    "it is slightly more difficult to estimate @xmath63 , as we need to determine the effective friction coefficient @xmath64 relating the force per unit length on the cell boundary to its velocity .",
    "this friction is not simple , as it arises from a combination of hydrodynamic effects between the cell membrane and the substrate and friction from breaking adhesions with the surface ; we do not know a convincing first - principles estimate of this value . in @xcite ,",

    "however , the details of our mechanical model shows that generic models of this sort ( e.g. @xcite ) can conceal surprises like reentry  it is not at all straightforward to map physical properties of cells into the effective parameters . in particular , because the destabilizing effect of the reaction - diffusion mechanism depends on the steady - state cell shape , any parameter that controls cell shape can alter the stability diagram , and cell shape may not be a simple monotonic function of changing physical parameters .",

    "however , we emphasize that in other cell types turning is associated with different morphology and may not be controlled by the simple mechanism studied here @xcite .",
    "we predict , based on our analysis , that when our mechanism applies , cell slowing will correspond with increased turning , but by a different mechanism than the speed - persistence relationship identified by @xcite .",
    "turning could potentially be prevented by reducing the membrane diffusion coefficient of polarity proteins on the surface of the cell , e.g. by increasing their binding to the cortex .",
    "we also argue that cell shape is a crucial mediator of turning : wider cells would , in this mechanism , tend to be less stable . any interventions that alter cell tension , contractility at the cell rear , or strength of protrusiveness , and thereby alter cell shape may disrupt or induce turning .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a simplified variant of a phase field cell motility model , extending our earlier work @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated that our model can support both straight and circular trajectories , with the circular trajectories occurring through a turning instability .",
    "we have argued that this instability occurs because of the instability of the protein dynamics model we have adapted @xcite that tends to orient proteins within the cell toward the cell s narrower ends .",
    "when combination of the protein dynamics and cell shape dynamics leads to the cell widening , this may lead to destabilization of the straight trajectory .",
