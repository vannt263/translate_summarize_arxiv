    "in this paper , we study certain random planar fractals that are close in spirit to random cantor sets constructed via independent iterations . before describing the class of sets that we will focus on ,",
    "let us first recall some features of the `` classical '' planar random cantor sets , sometimes known as mandelbrot percolation or fractal percolation :    * mandelbrot percolation . * define a set @xmath0 by removing independently each dyadic square inside the unit square @xmath1 ^ 2 $ ] with probability @xmath2 .",
    "this self - similar iterative procedure defines a random fractal that has been studied extensively @xcite . in the case where one replaces dyadic by triadic",
    ", one gets a natural `` random sierpinski carpet '' .",
    "clearly , one can interpret the set @xmath0 as the limit of a galton - watson tree .",
    "this implies immediately that when @xmath3 , then @xmath0 is almost surely empty , and that when @xmath4 , then @xmath5 .",
    "it is then possible and easy to compute the hausdorff dimension of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , when @xmath2 is small enough and the set @xmath0 is non - empty , @xmath0 has non - trivial connected components .",
    "it seems clear that their dimensions must be a deterministic function of @xmath2 , but in general it appears not possible to compute it explicitely in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "the set @xmath0 is statistically invariant under dyadic scaling in a rather obvious sense : for a dyadic square @xmath6 ^ 2 $ ] , the law of @xmath7 conditioned by the event that it is non - empty is equal to the law of @xmath0 itself conditioned not to be empty .",
    "a similar invariance under dyadic translations can be stated .",
    "however , this invariance is restricted to `` dyadic transformations '' and it can not be extended to more general maps .    a natural way to obtain stronger scale and translation invariance is to define the set @xmath0 by removing from @xmath1 ^ 2 $ ] all squares of a statistically translation - invariant and scale - invariant poisson point process of squares .",
    "in fact , one could also replace these squares by other planar shapes , such as line segments or disks .",
    "this gives rise to self - similar poisson percolation models , as studied for instance in @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the focus is on the existence and the nature of the phase transition for the connectivity property of @xmath0 in terms of the intensity @xmath8 of the poisson point process ( that replaces the factor @xmath9 ) : for small @xmath8 ( i.e. small @xmath2 ) , the set @xmath0 can have non - trivial connected components , and one can define the `` carpet '' @xmath10 that consists of all points of @xmath11 that can be connected to the boundary of the unit square by a path that remains in @xmath0 ( a typical point in @xmath0 will in fact not satisfy this property ; see figure  [ square_soup ] for an example , and section  [ remaining ] for a more complete discussion ) .",
    "[ square_soup ]        recently , it has been pointed out that a special and interesting case is to remove the interiors of brownian loops instead of squares . in other words ,",
    "one removes the interiors of a poisson collection of brownian loops called the brownian loop - soup and introduced in @xcite .",
    "indeed , planar brownian motion is conformally invariant , so that this collection of loops is not only scale - invariant , but also conformally invariant in a rather strong sense ( related to the conformal restriction property described in @xcite ) .",
    "this allows @xcite to derive links with other conformally invariant objects such as the gaussian free field or the stochastic loewner evolutions ( sle ) , via the notion of conformal loop ensembles ( cle ) studied in @xcite .",
    "the link with sle enables the study of many properties of those random cantor sets ( see sheffield - werner @xcite ) :    * we know the carpet is non - trivial if and only if @xmath12 ( the value @xmath13 depends of course on the choice of normalization for the brownian loop measure ) .",
    "* the complement of the carpet is made of disjoint `` holes '' whose boundaries are sle(@xmath14 ) loops for some explicit @xmath15 and the dimension of these loops is known ( @xcite ) . *",
    "schramm , sheffield and wilson @xcite have computed ( as a function of @xmath14 ) the `` expectation dimension '' of the carpet that measures the mean number of @xmath16-balls needed to cover it .",
    "this last result was our initial motivation for the present paper .",
    "we show here that the hausdorff dimension of the carpet is deterministic and equals the expectation dimension . in combination with the connection between cles and brownian loop soups derived in @xcite and the explicit formula for the expectation dimension in @xcite , this completes the determination of the almost sure hausdorff dimensions of cle carpets .",
    "more generally , our paper illustrates the fact that the `` brownian loop - soup '' approach to cle and sle can be helpful in the derivation of second - moment estimates that are used to determine hausdorff dimensions ( these second - moment estimates can turn out to be difficult to handle directly in the sle setting , see for instance @xcite for the dimension of the sle curve itself ) .",
    "[ brownian_soup ]        * the contribution of the present paper .",
    "* we study the dimension of the random carpet obtained from a poisson point process corresponding to a self - similar and translation invariant measure @xmath17 . in particular , we show that the carpet s hausdorff dimension @xmath18 is non - random , that it is equal to its `` expectation dimension '' , and we interpret the first terms of the expansion of @xmath18 as @xmath19 in terms of @xmath17 . the techniques that we use",
    "are rather classical , and are based on second - moment estimates ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we assume in this section that the measure @xmath45 ( and therefore also @xmath17 ) is supported on * simple * loops , that is , injective continuous maps from the unit circle into the plane .",
    "this will exclude the discrete stick soups ( discussed briefly at the end of this section ) and the brownian loop soup ( but we can define and recover the carpet for the latter via soups of outer boundaries of brownian loops ) .",
    "the carpet corresponds to a connected component of the random cantor set obtained by removing the interiors of all the loops .",

    "we will comment in a moment on whether this definition is equivalent to saying that there exists a continuous path from @xmath38 itself to @xmath168 that stays in @xmath0 .",
    "another almost equivalent approach is to look at * clusters of loops*. we say that two loops @xmath22 and @xmath169 of a random soup are connected if one can find a finite sequence @xmath170 in the soup such that for all @xmath171 , @xmath172 clearly , connection between loops forms an equivalence relation , and one can then define the clusters of the soup as the union of all @xmath164 s for the loops in the same equivalence class .",
    "note that for technical reasons , we require here not only that the two curves @xmath164 and @xmath173 intersect but also that their interiors do . in many cases ,",
    "this definition can be relaxed , as translation invariance can be easily be used to show that almost surely ( for a sample of the soup ) , if two curves intersect then so do their interiors .",
    "the clusters may be nested , this may occur for example when one loop lies inside another one .",
    "given a loop - soup in the entire plane , one can wonder whether there exist clusters of infinite diameter .",
    "@xmath174 law implies in the standard way that this event has probability either 0 or 1 , depending on the law of the soup .",
    "furthermore , if the measure @xmath17 is supported on loops with positive inner area , it follows immediately that any disk @xmath175 is almost surely contained in the interior of some loop @xmath164 .",
    "since this holds for arbitrarily large @xmath116 , it follows that if there exists a cluster of infinite diameter , then it is unique . in this case , let @xmath176 denote the distance between the unbounded cluster and the origin .",
    "clearly , @xmath176 is a scale - invariant finite real random variable , so that @xmath177 almost surely .",
    "it follows that for a loop soup in the entire plane :    * either all clusters are bounded almost surely * or there almost surely exists exactly one cluster , and this cluster is dense and unbounded .",
    "since our main interest in the present paper is the geometry of the clusters rather then the phase transition , we will focus on the case when all clusters are bounded almost surely and the carpets are not empty .",
    "more precisely , our assumption on @xmath17 goes as follows :    * subcriticality assumption 1 . * _ all clusters in the full - plane loop soup are almost surely bounded . _",
    "in fact , we will assume an _ a priori _ slightly stronger condition : * subcriticality assumption 2 .",
    "* _ with positive probability , there exists a ( random ) closed loop @xmath178 in the plane that surrounds the origin and does not `` cross '' any loop of the loop - soup . _    in this definition , and throughout the rest of this paper , we say that two loops `` cross '' if each one of the two does intersect the interior of the other one .",
    "let us stress that the loop @xmath178 is not a loop of the loop - soup .",
    "note that a simple @xmath174 argument then implies that any given point is almost surely surrounded by infinitely many such loops ( of arbitrarily small or large diameter ) that cross no loop in the loop - soup .",
    "let us now consider a domain @xmath104 as before and choose a given point @xmath38 on its boundary .",
    "the fact that there almost surely exist such small loops @xmath178 around @xmath38 that cross no loop of the full - plane loop - soup implies immediately that the carpet in @xmath104 is not empty ( because the intersection of this small loop with @xmath104 is in the carpet ) .",
    "hence , subcriticality implies that the carpets are almost surely non - empty .",
    "note also that subcriticality clearly implies that the measure @xmath17 is thin",
    ".    it could be interesting to study the converse i.e. whether non - triviality of the carpet and thinness imply our subcriticality assumption .",
    "this is for instance not difficult if one assumes invariance of @xmath17 under certain rotations . in that case",

    "this is what we will do in the next subsection .",
    "to formalize this idea , let us first consider the product measure @xmath454 , on pairs @xmath455 of one loop ( `` sampled '' from @xmath45 ) and one loop - soup with intensity @xmath412 * in the entire plane*. we have seen that we can choose the finite measure @xmath45 in such a way that it is supported on the set of loops of diameter @xmath13 contained in the square @xmath53 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath226 be the set of all curves in @xmath98 that have diameter smaller than @xmath13 and let @xmath456 be the `` filling '' of the cluster of @xmath457 that contains @xmath22 ( i.e. the closure of the complement of the unbounded connected component of the complement of the cluster ) .",

    ", @xmath471 can also be constructed as the union of @xmath465 independent soups of intensity @xmath475 .",
    "hence we can find a sufficiently large @xmath465 so that the probability that the loop - soup @xmath476 with intensity @xmath477 contains a cluster that crosses the ring is smaller than @xmath478",
    ".    using scale - invariance , it follows that for all @xmath479 , the probability that @xmath480 contains a cluster that crosses the ring @xmath481 is smaller than @xmath482 . clearly , the same is true if one looks only at the loop - soup @xmath226 consisting only of the loops in @xmath98 of diameter",
    "smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "but the events that @xmath226 contains a cluster that crosses the ring @xmath483 for @xmath484 are in fact independent : they depend only on those loops that intersect each of the rings , and these sets of loops are disjoint since all loops have diameter smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "we conclude that the probability that a cluster of @xmath226 crosses the ring @xmath485 is bounded by @xmath486 .",
    "this immediately implies the last item of the lemma .",
    "finally , observe that if we couple the realizations of @xmath490 for all @xmath8 , then almost surely @xmath491 converges to the filling of the initial loop @xmath22 when @xmath19 , as all other loops disappear .",
    "this follows , for instance , from the fact ( proved using the same argument as above ) that for any given ring @xmath492 , the probability that a loop - soup cluster of @xmath493 crosses the ring goes to zero as @xmath8 goes to @xmath33 .",
    "we conclude , using monotone convergence , that @xmath494    we now construct the measure @xmath495 from @xmath17 similarly to the way @xmath458 was constructed from @xmath45 : consider the product measure @xmath496 , on pairs @xmath455 of one loop ( `` sampled '' from @xmath406 ) and one loop - soup with intensity @xmath412 in the entire plane .",
    "let @xmath497 be the set of all curves in @xmath98 that have diameter smaller than @xmath22 and let @xmath456 be the `` filling '' of the cluster of @xmath498 that contains @xmath22 .",
    "we denote by @xmath495 the measure under which @xmath456 is defined .",
    "clearly , scale - invariance and translation - invariance of @xmath17 ( and of the loop - soup ) imply that @xmath495 is also scale - invariant , translation - invariant , and that it can be constructed ( as in section 2 ) from @xmath458 ( note that the previous lemma ensures that @xmath499 ) .",
    "in fact , this definition makes it possible to define a poisson point process of pairs @xmath500 i.e. to couple a loop - soup with intensity @xmath406 with a loop - soup with intensity @xmath495 in such a way that for each @xmath501 , @xmath502 ( basically , each loop @xmath164 is extended by an independent soup of loops of smaller diameter in the whole plane ) . if we keep those @xmath164 that are in a domain @xmath104 , we get a loop - soup @xmath107 with intensity @xmath452 . but mind that the corresponding @xmath503 s do not necessarily stay in @xmath104 . however , they are not likely to be very large , as we now show . to keep things simple ,",
    "we assume for the rest of this section that @xmath104 is the unit disk ; we can do this without loss of generality , since the dimension of the carpet does not depend on the domain .",
    "let @xmath415 and @xmath116 be defined as in the proof of lemma  [ 15 ] , and consider the coupling @xmath500 defined above .",
    "if @xmath8 is small enough , then the probability that for all @xmath501 such that @xmath504 , the diameter of @xmath503 does not exceed @xmath505 is strictly positive .",
    "this is in fact a simple consequence of the last statement of lemma [ 15 ] .",
    "it suffices to show that the set @xmath506 has finite mass .",
    "note that because of scale - invariance , the @xmath17-mass of the set of loops in @xmath104 with diameter between @xmath507 and @xmath508 grows slower than @xmath509 as @xmath510 . but as @xmath511 converges , the lemma follows readily .",
    "let @xmath107 be a subcritical soup with intensity @xmath412 in the unit disk , and let @xmath180 defined as before .",
    "for @xmath8 small enough , there exists a constant @xmath465 such that for all small @xmath204 , @xmath512 , where @xmath513 .",
    "let us consider the construction of the loop soup clusters @xmath514 in @xmath104 described in proposition [ soup_via_many_soups ] . clearly , if we compare it with the coupling that we have just described , we can choose our coupling @xmath500 in such a way that each @xmath447 is in fact a subset of one of the @xmath503 s with @xmath504 .",
    "one therefore has @xmath515 where @xmath516 denotes the event that none of the sets @xmath503 with @xmath504 surround the disc of radius @xmath204 ( this is because each cluster in the initial loop - soup is contained in some @xmath503 ) .",
    "this last event depends on the poisson point process of pairs @xmath500 only .",
    "let @xmath517 denote the event that that for all @xmath501 such that @xmath504 , one has @xmath518 .",
    "recall from the previous lemma that this event has a positive probability ( provided @xmath8 is small enough ) .",
    "let @xmath519 denote the event that none of the sets @xmath503 that are subsets of @xmath520 and of diameter greater than @xmath204 surround the origin .",
    "this event is independent of @xmath517 , as they occur for disjoint set of pairs @xmath521 .",
    "note that @xmath522 .",
    "hence , @xmath523 it therefore remains to estimate @xmath524 .",
    "this is equivalent to an estimate concerning the remaining set of the poisson point process of sets @xmath525 in @xmath526 , and is obtained just as for the first - moment estimate in lemma [ coeff_c ] .",
    "we can now conclude the proof of proposition [ eq ] . recall that @xmath527 because the remaining set contains the carpet . on the other hand ,",
    "the previous lemma and the definition of @xmath528 show that the @xmath529 corresponding to the loop - soup with intensity @xmath432 is not larger than @xmath530 .      as we have already mentioned , in the case of the brownian loop - soup , the connection between the boundaries of clusters derived in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and the schramm - loewner evolutions make it possible to describe the carpet via branching sle - type paths @xcite .",
    "schramm , sheffield and wilson @xcite computed in fact the `` expected dimension '' of the carpet , and our paper shows that this `` expected dimension '' ( the quantity that governs the first moment ) is equal to the almost sure hausdorff dimension @xmath18 . combining all these results , the expression derived in @xcite implies that for @xmath531 , @xmath532 where @xmath8 and @xmath14 are related by the `` usual '' relation @xmath533 .",
    "it follows that @xmath534 note that @xmath535 .",
    "as explained in @xcite ( in the context of the remaining set ) , the coefficient of the first order term @xmath536 is closely related to the mean area of the brownian loop computed in @xcite .",
    "recall @xcite that the hausdorff dimension of the sle@xmath537 curve is almost surely equal to @xmath538 . hence ,",
    "in the brownian loop - soup case , we also know the dimension of the boundary of the carpet ."
