    "the universal properties that appear in the proximity of a critical point are determined by a few relevant properties .",
    "the spatial dimensionality , @xmath3 , is one of them @xcite .",
    "this is evident from the fact that , in general , the critical exponents depend on @xmath3 .",
    "correspondingly , for strongly anisotropic systems of weakly coupled chains or planes , critical behavior characteristic for @xmath4 or @xmath5 respectively can be observed beyond a certain distance from the critical point .",
    "the critical behavior crosses over to three ",
    "dimensional only in the close vicinity of the critical point of such anisotropic systems .",
    "in contrast to this conventional dimensional crossover , the spatial dimensionality can be effectively reduced under certain conditions as the system approaches the critical point .",
    "this phenomenon of _ dimensional reduction _ is closely related to the notion of _ emergent sliding symmetries _",
    "those are physical systems for which new symmetry transformations appear at low energies ( in some cases only at @xmath0 ) . in other words ,",
    "the low energy spectrum of the system hamiltonian is invariant under these symmetries but the whole spectrum is not @xcite .",
    "we call these transformations emergent symmetries  because they only appear at low energies . by sliding symmetry  @xcite",
    "we mean symmetry transformations that only change a subset of the degrees of freedom which occupy a region of dimension lower than @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , if our system is a 3d quantum magnet and it is invariant under a spin rotation restricted to a given layer , such operation is a sliding symmetry .",
    "a simple example of an emergent sliding symmetry is provided by classical spins on a body centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice with antiferromagnetic xy exchange interactions . if the inter  layer exchange interaction , @xmath6 , is smaller than the intra ",
    "layer one , @xmath7 , the energy is minimized when the spins are antiferromagnetically aligned on each layer .",
    "since the staggered magnetization of each layer can point in any arbitrary direction , the ground state manifold is highly degenerate . in this case ,",
    "an arbitrary spin rotation along the z  axis which acts only on the spins of a given layer is a sliding emergent symmetry .",
    "it is a symmetry because it does not change the ground state energy .",
    "it is emergent  because it only exists at @xmath0 : the energy _ does not _ remain invariant if we apply the same transformation to an excited state . in particular",
    ", this symmetry is the manifestation of a simple physical property : the order parameters ( staggered magnetization ) of different layers are decoupled at zero temperature .",
    "consequently , in spite of the 3d nature of the system , the antiferromagnetic ordering is 2d at @xmath0 .",
    "this is a simple example of dimensional reduction that results from two key ingredients : the classical nature of the degrees of freedom and the frustrated nature of the interactions .",
    "it is natural to ask if the phenomenon of dimensional reduction also exists in quantum systems . in most of the cases ,",
    "the emergent sliding symmetry is removed by zero point fluctuations .",
    "for instance , if we consider now the quantum version of the xy model on a bct lattice with @xmath8 , the ground state is no longer invariant under spin rotations along the z  axis of all the spins on a given layer . therefore , this operation is an emergent symmetry only in the classical limit .",
    "zero point fluctuations remove this symmetry by inducing a finite coupling between the staggered magnetization on different layers @xcite .",
    "this is a particular example of the phenomenon known as order from disorder @xcite .",
    "however , zero point fluctuations not always restore the dimensionality by removing the emergent sliding symmetries .",
    "such symmetries can appear at special points of the quantum phase diagram and lead to dimensional reduction .",
    "the main characteristic of these special points is that the ground state becomes `` classical '' , i.e. , it is a direct product of eigenstates of a local physical operator .",
    "for instance , the fully polarized ferromagnet is a `` classical '' state for any spin @xmath9 .",
    "a simple example of dimensional reduction in a quantum system is given in ref.@xcite for a klein model of s=1/2 spins on square lattice . in that case , the dimensional reduction from @xmath5 to @xmath4 occurs at a first order quantum phase transition point .",
    "an immediate physical consequence of this dimensional reduction is the emergence of fractional excitations characteristic of one  dimensional systems .    we have shown recently that the phenomenon of dimensional reduction can also occur at a quantum critical point ( second order quantum phase transition ) @xcite . for this purpose , we considered the quantum xy magnet of our previous example but in the presence of an external magnetic field , @xmath10 , along the z  direction .",
    "the ground state is antiferromgnetic for @xmath11 while the zeeman term dominates at high fields leading to a fully polarized ground state .",
    "the antiferromagnetically ordered xy component decreases continuously as a function of @xmath10 and vanishes at the critical field @xmath12 .",
    "the spin system becomes fully polarized for @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding quantum phase transition is denoted as bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) because the order is suppressed by suppressing the _ amplitude _ of the order parameter or staggered magnetization .",
    "in contrast , the thermodynamic phase transition is denoted as xy because the order is suppressed by phase fluctuations . as we will see below ,",
    "this difference is crucial for the phenomenon of dimensional reduction .",
    "the bec  qcp of the system under consideration has a peculiar property : the disordered state for @xmath13 is classical  because it is a direct product of eigenstates of @xmath14 ( @xmath15component of the spin operator on a given site @xmath16 ) .",
    "in other words , the zero point phase fluctuations that restore the 3d ordering at @xmath11 are no longer present for @xmath13 simply because the xy spin component has been suppressed completely .",
    "since the transition is continuous , the 3d coupling induced by these phase fluctuations must vanish continuously when @xmath10 approaches @xmath12 from the ordered side .",
    "for this reason , dimensional reduction occurs right at the critical point .    the specific motivation for the theory presented in this paper is the unusual temperature dependence of the transition temperature as function of magnetic field in frustrated magnet bacusi@xmath17o@xmath18@xcite .",
    "we describe this system by a heisenberg hamiltonian of @xmath19 @xmath20 spins forming dimers on a body  centered tetragonal lattice , closely approximating the case of bacusi@xmath17o@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the dominant heisenberg interaction , @xmath21 , is between spins on the same dimer @xmath16 .",
    "since there are two low energy states in an applied magnetic field , the singlet and the @xmath22 triplet , we can describe the low energy sector either using hard ",
    "core bosons , or , in terms of the above mentioned xy model . in case of the hard core boson description",
    ", the triplet state corresponds to an effective site @xmath16 occupied by a boson while the singlet state is mapped into the empty site @xcite .",
    "the number of bosons ( number of triplets ) equals the magnetization along the @xmath15axis .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath23 is determined by the applied magnetic field , @xmath10 , and the critical field @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the gyromagnetic factor , @xmath26 is the bohr magneton and @xmath27 is the inter ",
    "dimer exchange interaction ) . the hoppings @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "( @xmath30 is the frustrated inter ",
    "layer exchange interaction ) are determined by the inter ",
    "dimer exchange interactions between spins .",
    "recently , it was shown by rsch and vojta @xcite that the inclusion of the two higher triplet modes generates a small coherent second neighbor hopping of low energy triplets between layers @xmath31 .",
    "this interesting effect restores the @xmath32 character of the spin problem due to the fact that the paramagnetic ground state for @xmath33 is not purely classical .",
    "although it can be described as classical state ( direct product of singlets on each dimer ) to a very good approximation , there are small zero  point phase fluctuations that result from virtual process to the higher triplet states ( creation and annihilation of triplet pairs with zero net magnetic moment ) .",
    "it was also pointed out in refs.@xcite that the dimensional reduction is still exact at @xmath34 ( saturation field ) because the state for @xmath35 is purely classical . for realistic values of @xmath36k and @xmath37 ,",
    "@xmath38mk in bacusi@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the mechanism discussed in our paper is still dominant for all experimentally accessible temperatures @xmath39mk .",
    "moreover , the u(1)-symmetry breaking terms induced by dipolar interactions will produce a crossover to qcp with discrete symmetry at @xmath40mk @xcite before the mechanism of ref.@xcite sets in .",
    "finally , the inevitable presence of finite non - frustrated couplings in real systems will eventually restore the @xmath32 behavior below some characteristic temperature @xmath41mk .    despite the above mentioned effects , where lattice distortions , dipolar couplings or excitations to high energy triplets cause a restoration of three dimensional behavior at very low temperatures , is it important to stress that the boson model discussed in this paper is a nontrivial interacting many - body system where the dimensional reduction at the @xmath0 quantum critical point is exact .",
    "materials that can be described in terms of a chemical potential tuned bose - einstein condensation on a frustrating lattice are then candidates for the dimensional reduction as caused by an emergent symmetry in the problem . in this sense",
    "are the conclusions of our paper are not limited to bacusi@xmath17o@xmath18 alone .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to derive the critical properties of the field induced bec ",
    "qcp for the xy magnet mentioned above .",
    "the key finding of our result is the detailed phase diagram of fig.[phase_diagram ] , where we show the various crossover regimes of a chemical potential tuned bec on a frustrated lattice .",

    "we use the language of hard core bosons which are equivalent to @xmath42 spins after a matsubara  matsuda transformation @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian of interacting spinless bosons on a body centered cubic lattice @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the local number operator of the bosons and @xmath45 the corresponding creation operator in momentum space .",
    "the tight binding dispersion for nearest neighbor boson hopping on the bct lattice is @xmath46 @xmath47 refers to the in plane momentum and @xmath48 is the in - plane dispersion . for convenience",

    "the last term in eq.([tb2 ] ) refers to the inter - plane coupling , where the form factor @xmath52 describes the @xmath53-dependence of this coupling in the bct lattice .",
    "this @xmath53-dependence is a crucial aspect of our theory .    for @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    ", bose einstein condensation takes place at @xmath57 . since @xmath58 vanishes for @xmath59",
    ", @xmath60 is independent of @xmath61 .",
    "the minimum of the dispersion is infinitely degenerate as the @xmath15-component of the wave vector can take any value when the @xmath62 and @xmath63 components are equal to @xmath64 . in case of the ideal bose gas ( @xmath65 )",
    "this implies for @xmath0 that different layers decouple completely .",
    "only excitations at finite @xmath66 with in - plane momentum away from the condensation point can propagate in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "this behavior changes as soon as boson - boson interactions ( @xmath67 ) are included .",
    "states in the bose condensate scatter and create virtual excitations above the condensate that are allowed to propagate in the @xmath15-direction . these excitations couple to condensate states in other layers@xcite .",
    "the condensed state of interacting bosons is then truly three dimensional , even at @xmath0 .",
    "this order by disorder argument for dimensional restoration due to interactions does not apply in case of chemical potential tuned bec . in this case , the number of bosons at @xmath0 is strictly zero for @xmath68 , i.e. before bec sets in .",
    "the absence of particles makes their interaction mute and one can approach the qcp arbitrarily closely without coherently coupling different layers .    from now on , we will measure the momentum relative to the wave vector @xmath69 : @xmath70 , such that bec corresponds to a macroscopic occupation of a state with vanishing in - plane momentum , @xmath71 . since we will treat the inter - layer hopping , @xmath72 , pertubativly , it is convenient to rewrite @xmath73 using real space variables for the direction perpendicular to the planes . @xmath74 the indices @xmath16,@xmath75 denote the different layers , with @xmath76 for nearest neighbor layers while @xmath77 otherwise .",
    "due to the shift of momentum it holds @xmath78    we note that @xmath73 has a discrete @xmath79symmetry @xcite : @xmath80 for all @xmath16 .",
    "this is a local @xmath79symmetry with respect to the layer index . in momentum space",
    "the last equation corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "the in - plane dispersion and the local interaction trivially obey this symmetry .",
    "however , the inter - layer hopping is only invariant with respect to this transformation since @xmath82 is odd  with respect to either @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "this discrete symmetry is therefore closely connected to the degeneracy of the bose condensate with respect to @xmath85 . if we were to include an additional inter - layer hopping term between neighboring planes with @xmath86-independent hopping @xmath87 , @xmath88 we would break the @xmath79-symmetry .",
    "in addition we would lift the degeneracy of the bose condensate to either @xmath89 or @xmath90 , depending on the sign of @xmath87 . on the other hand , inclusion of a term @xmath91 that promotes boson hopping between second neighbors ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 otherwise ) would lift the degeneracy of the bose condensate , but without breaking the @xmath79-symmetry .",
    "we will see below that this leads to important distinction between coherent coupling between nearest and next nearest neighbor layers .",
    "while the bose condensed state for @xmath94 and the entire regime for @xmath95 is three dimensional , the decoupling for @xmath96 has dramatic consequences .",
    "we show that the bec transition temperature varies as @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 holds instead for an isotropic bose system in @xmath100 . despite the fact that different layers are coupled at finite @xmath66 the bec - transition temperature , eq.([tc ] ) ,",
    "depends on @xmath101 just like the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition temperature of a two dimensional system @xcite",
    ".    the renormalization group ( rg ) calculation used to obtain this result ( a one - loop rg calculation in analogy to ref.@xcite ) shows that the finite temperature transition is a classical @xmath102-@xmath3 @xmath103 transition , not a bkt transition .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the @xmath0 qcp of chemical potential tuned bec with three dimensional dispersion , eq.([tb2 ] ) , is strictly two dimensional .",

    ". then we integrate out states with @xmath241 .",
    "we first give the one loop renormalization group equations for @xmath236 .",
    "it holds @xmath242 as well as @xmath243 where we use the short hand notation : @xmath244    for @xmath240 the renormalized inter - layer hopping element is comparable to the in - plane hopping @xmath54 and we are finally allowed to perform a continuum s theory for the direction perpendicular to the layers as well .",
    "then , the problem is identical to the one of an isotropic three dimensional bose system @xmath245 where @xmath246 is a @xmath247 -dimensional vector that includes the momentum @xmath85 .",
    "the initial values for this flow are determined by the final values for the flow for @xmath248 .",
    "the isotropic boson interaction @xmath249 corresponds to the @xmath250 value of the coupling constants @xmath115 . for short ranged couplings @xmath251",
    "it is dominated by the largest coupling constant .",
    "the additional prefactor @xmath252 , with lattice constant in the @xmath15 -direction , ensures that @xmath251 is a three dimensional coupling constant with dimension @xmath253 ^{d}\\left [ \\mathrm{energy }   \\right ] $ ] for @xmath32 .",
    "we first analyze the quantum to classical crossover at @xmath254 .",
    "it is useful to consider separately the behavior in the quantum regime , where the renormalized temperature is small compared to the upper energy cut off @xmath255 and the classical regime , where @xmath256 .",
    "we treat both regimes separately and  assume @xmath257 in the former and @xmath258 in the latter regime and connect the flow of the various coupling constants smoothly at @xmath259 .",
    "this is essentially the approach taken in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis of ref.@xcite demonstrates that the approach used here is fully consistent with results obtained using a more careful analysis of the crossover behavior .    at @xmath0 ,",
    "the flow of the chemical potential and of the coherent inter - layer boson hopping @xmath260 are unaffected by the interaction between bosons .",
    "this result is specific for the problem of dilute bosons with @xmath68 since for @xmath0 @xmath261 as a result of the integration over frequency .",
    "physically this is due to the fact that the boson number vanishes for @xmath0 and @xmath68 .",
    "this yields the renormalization group equations : @xmath262 at @xmath0 , interaction do not affect @xmath101 , @xmath87 and @xmath218 .",
    "this only happens once the system reaches the classical regime @xmath223 .",
    "since @xmath263 , it follows that @xmath264 as long as the system is in the quantum regime .",
    "quantum fluctuations do not induce a coherent hopping between layers .",
    "the inter - layer hopping @xmath265 remains unchanged .",
    "note , that the amplitude @xmath72 of this inter - layer coupling is unchanged under renormalization .",
    "the flow of the chemical potential is @xmath266    next we analyze the behavior of the interactions .  at @xmath0",
    "holds @xmath267 which vanishes again because of the vanishing boson density .",
    "we are left with the analysis of @xmath268 in appendix a we analyze this flow equation in the limit where the bare inter - layer hopping @xmath72 is much smaller than the in - plane hopping @xmath269 . up to order",
    "@xmath270 we have to analyze the coupling for bosons in the same layer @xmath271 , in neighboring layers @xmath272 with @xmath273 and second neighbor layers @xmath272 with @xmath274 .",
    "we obtain at large @xmath275 ( @xmath276 ) : @xmath277 it is important to keep in mind that these results were obtained with the assumption that initially @xmath278 is the  only coupling constant . the inter - layer interactions @xmath131 and @xmath132 result from multiple scatterings in distinct layers where virtual bosons propagate between layers .",
    "thus , we find that there is no coherent coupling between layers in the quantum regime i.e @xmath279 . on the other hand",
    ", we do find that non - local interactions , that couple different layers , emerge .",
    "this is fully consistent with the finding of refs.@xcite .    at finite @xmath66 ,",
    "the flow in the quantum regime stops at @xmath280 for @xmath223 thermal , as opposed to quantum fluctuations , come into play .",
    "the initial values for the subsequent flow are of course the final values of the rg flow of the quantum regime : @xmath281 and @xmath282 where the @xmath283 are given in eq.([finq ] ) .",
    "the rg flows for @xmath223 continues to be two dimensional , as no coherent inter - layer was generated in the quantum regime . as discussed above we",
    "will now analyze the flow equations as if the problem was purely classical , i.e. we include solely the lowest matsubara frequency in the evaluation of the feynman diagrams . in this case temperature only enters the flow equations in the combination @xmath284 thus , it is convenient to use @xmath285 in what follows .",
    "the leading order flow equations of @xmath285 are @xmath286 with solution @xmath287 the coupling constants @xmath285 are relevant .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the upper critical dimension of the classical regime is @xmath288 as opposed to @xmath289 for the zero temperature quantum regime .",
    "if we wanted to determine the critical exponents of the classical phase transition , we would have to include higher order terms .",
    "as pointed out by millis@xcite , it is not necessary to include these higher order terms if one only wants to determine the value of the transition temperature : at low @xmath66 , the coupling constants @xmath290 decrease for large @xmath259 as follows from eq.([finq ] ) .",
    "thus , the initial values @xmath291 of the classical flow are small . while the interactions become relevant for @xmath223 corrections to eq.([flowclassu ] ) remain negligible unless the flow enters the actual critical regime .",
    "however , in our case the flow only enters the critical regime after the dimensional crossover .",
    "thus , we can , for the moment , safely neglect corrections beyond eq.([flowclassu ] ) .",
    "as shown in appendix b , the rg flow equations for the coherent hopping elements and the chemical potential in the classical regime are @xmath292 it immediately follows that @xmath293 since @xmath294 .",
    "no coherent nearest neighbor hopping @xmath87 is being generated by the mechanism we describe .",
    "this is a consequence of the discussed @xmath79-symmetry .",
    "a finite value for @xmath87 corresponds to a broken @xmath79 symmetry .  however , the second neighbor coupling @xmath218 flows to a finite value even if its initial value vanishes .",
    "if we use @xmath295 of eq.([wl ] ) with initial values @xmath296 from eq.([finq ] ) it follows @xmath297 where @xmath298 the solutions of these differential equations are @xmath299 in the last equation we already took into account that the initial value of the coherent hopping vanishes : @xmath300 . the dimensional crossover takes place at @xmath229 where @xmath301 , which corresponds to @xmath302 for large @xmath303 this is equivalent to @xmath304 this yields @xmath305 as well as @xmath306 inserting @xmath307 @xmath308and @xmath309 gives @xmath310 for the value of the coupling constant at the end of the two dimensional flow and @xmath311 for the corresponding chemical potential .",
    "as pointed out above , for @xmath312 , the rg probes energies sufficiently low to be sensitive to the three dimensional character of the system .",
    "these final values of the combined quantum and classical two dimensional flow become the initial value of the three dimensional flow . since always holds @xmath313 , it follows that this three dimensional flow is always in the classical regime .",
    "the final regime of the flow is in the classical three dimensional regime .",
    "the flow equations are the usual ones for an isotropic three dimensional classical bosonic system , i.e. for an two component @xmath314 or @xmath103 model .",
    "the condition for the critical temperature is that the initial values for the flow of this three dimensional classical flow obey : @xmath315 this ensures that the flow is on the critical surface and the system is close to the critical temperature .",
    "an alternative way to interpret this condition was given in ref.@xcite where it was shown that eq.([crit ] ) is equivalent to the ginzburg criterion for the onset of critical fluctuations . whenever a system is in the ginzburg regime of classical critical fluctuations",
    ", it is very close to the actual critical temperature .",
    "the detailed analysis inside this regime is the usual one for a @xmath32 classical @xmath103 model and does not need be reproduced here .",
    "we are more interested in the value of the transition temperature at low @xmath66 .",
    "we use our previous results for the initial values @xmath316 and @xmath317 of the three dimensional flow to analyze the condition eq.([crit ] )  and obtain @xmath318 solving this result for @xmath98 with logarithmic accuracy yields the transition temperature as function of chemical potential , as given in eq .",
    "( [ tc ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram that results from our rg analysis is represented in fig.[phase_diagram ] .",
    "in summary , we have shown that inter  layer frustration reduces the effective dimensionality of a bec quantum phase transition induced by a change of the chemical potential .",
    "the bec - qcp exhibits 2d quantum critical fluctuations that dominate over an extended region of the phase diagram .",
    "the phase boundary between the disordered and ordered phase extends to finite temperatures although the universality class of the transition changes from bec in 2 + 2 dimensions at @xmath0 to 3d  xy at finite @xmath66 . for @xmath95",
    ", there is a crossover from the 2d quantum critical to a 2d classical regime as the system approaches the phase boundary from disordered side .",
    "the dimensional crossover occurs within the classical regime as the system gets even closer to the phase boundary ( see figs.[phase_diagram ] and [ flow ] ) .",
    "the bec ordering is accompanied by bond ordering that results from a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath179symmetry discussed in section ii .",
    "both , the bec and the bond order parameters increase continuously from zero for @xmath319 . a finite bond ",
    "order parameter induces a finite hopping between nearest ",
    "neighbor layers that vanishes at the phase boundary together with the bond ordering .",
    "although according to our results the thermodynamic phase transition always belongs to the 3d  xy universality class , this transition becomes more quasi2d like as the system approaches the 2d bec - qcp .",
    "besides the consequences that were already discussed in the paper , like the peculiar behavior of @xmath320 given by eq.([tc ] ) , this observation has implications for the @xmath66dependence of any thermodynamic quantity for @xmath321 and @xmath322 given the dimensional crossover predicted by our rg calculation .",
    "the dimensional reduction at a qcp that we discussed in this paper can be experimentally verified in real quantum magnets such as bacusi@xmath323o@xmath324 @xcite . for quantum magnets ,",
    "the chemical potential corresponds to a magnetic field applied along the symmetry axis while the particle density corresponds ot the magnetization per site .",
    "therefore , the quantum phase transition discussed in this paper corresponds to the suppression of magnetic xy  ordering by the application of a magentic field that saturates the moments along the z  direction .",
    "although we discussed the case of a bct lattice , our result can be applied to more general layered structures with frustrated inter  layer coupling .",

    ". only terms with @xmath273 and @xmath274 are being generated at fourth order in @xmath72 .",
    "we will then introduce three different coupling constants , @xmath346 , @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "it will turn out to be crucial to include @xmath132 in addition to the leading non - local coupling @xmath131 . performing the lattice sums yields explicit flow equations for the three coupling constants .",
    "if we now keep in mind that due to the initial conditions @xmath349 vertices with @xmath131 are at least of order @xmath350 and vertices with @xmath132 are at least of order @xmath351 @xmath308  we can restrict the flow equations to  fourth order in @xmath352 : @xmath353 with @xmath354 . for large @xmath275",
    "we expect a decay of the coupling constants according to @xmath355 .",

    "it follows @xmath362 inserting these results into eq.([vvsh ] ) yields the result eq.([finq ] ) .      as discussed in the main text , in the two dimensional classical regime we concentrate of the flow equations of the chemical potential and coherent hopping elements .",
    "we start from the general rg equations given in eq.([rgsglp ] ) .",
    "using the fact that @xmath115 has only three nonvanishing contributions @xmath363  with @xmath364 and @xmath134 ( same layer ) , @xmath365 , neighboring layers and @xmath366 ( second neighbor layers ) . inserting this result into eq.([rgsglp ] ) yields :      it holds up to second order in @xmath72 : @xmath368 here we ignored effects due to @xmath87 and @xmath218 as those will only be of higher order in @xmath163 .",
    "this enables us to perform the shell integration @xmath369 where we only included the zeroth s matsubara frequency in the classical regime .",
    "the contribution for the nearest neighbor coupling vanishes since @xmath370 , an effect caused by the @xmath79-symmetry of the hamiltonian .  inserting these results into eq.([flowint ] ) yields eq.([flowhop ] ) .",
    "the solution of the flow equations then yields values for the second neighbor hopping small by @xmath371 , justifying our assumption to neglect @xmath218 in the right hand side of eq.([gexp ] ) .",
    "it is also important to notice that including terms with coherent neighbor hopping @xmath87 in eq.([gexp ] ) and self consistently solving the rg equation for @xmath87 still yields @xmath372 on the disordered side of the phase transition ."
