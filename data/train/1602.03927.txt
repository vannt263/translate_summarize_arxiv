    "this agreement between continuous measures of the point of breaking of the capillary bridge and the inflection point suggests that the observed relation between @xmath82 and @xmath83 is not coincidental . in app .",
    "[ secc ] we provide an argument that this relation is quite general and should hold for a wide range of systems .",
    "in this paper we have studied a two  dimensional ising strip of width @xmath18 bounded by inhomogeneous planar walls .",
    "the influence of the walls on the system was represented by a short  range surface field acting on spins located next to the corresponding walls .",
    "this surface field is equal to @xmath0 , except for a group of @xmath1 surface sites , where the field is @xmath2 .",
    "the inhomogeneities on the walls are shifted laterally by a distance @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ sec1:fig1 ] ) . using a specially adapted method based on the exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix ,",
    "we have derived formulas for the free energy and magnetization profile of the strip .",
    "the formulas depend on some coefficients and matrix elements that can only be calculated numerically .",
    "we have studied the critical casimir force acting between the walls and its relation to the magnetization profile . because the walls ( and thus the surface field ) are inhomogeneous , the force has both normal and lateral component .",
    "we have found that for all temperatures the lateral component of the critical casimir force always acts in the direction opposite to the shift . for small shifts ( @xmath90 )",
    "the force grows linearly and , upon increasing @xmath3 ( for @xmath91 ) it saturates at @xmath92 , where @xmath71 is a surface tension in the strip ( see ) .",
    "if @xmath3 is further increased ( @xmath93 ) , the force decays exponentially with the characteristic length ",

    "next , we have investigated the excess normal critical casimir force ( i.e. , the part of the normal force that comes from the interaction of two inhomogeneities ) .",
    "this force is always negative ( attractive ) and is the strongest for @xmath81 .",
    "similarly to the lateral component , for @xmath94 , upon increasing @xmath95 the excess normal force decays exponentially with the length ",
    "scale @xmath50 .",
    "we have also discovered that for @xmath96 the vector of the excess total force has almost constant length and only its direction is changing upon changing @xmath3 .",
    "to explain the observed properties of the critical casimir force , we have calculated magnetization profiles in the strip .",
    "we have discovered that the rapid decay of the critical casimir force observed for @xmath94 is correlated with the disappearance of the capillary bridge .",
    "we have considered two different scenarios of breaking of the bridge : increasing @xmath3 for fixed @xmath1 and decreasing @xmath1 for @xmath81 . in both cases , below the wetting temperature @xmath63 ,",
    "this morphological transition looks to be of the first order while for @xmath97 it turns continuous . because in the ising strip with finite width there can not be a real phase transition , this observation is only a suggestion of possible behavior of higher  dimensional systems .",
    "unfortunately , numerical complications accompanying the evaluation of magnetization profiles were too substantial to consider systems large enough to study precisely the nature of observed transitions .",
    "additionally , by introducing an inhomogeneity to the ising strip , we were able to extract two different magnetization profiles ( see ) of the homogeneous strip with opposite surface fields for temperatures below the wetting temperature @xmath63 . due to the nearly spontaneously broken symmetry , these two profiles have always the same probability and standard calculation can not discern them .",
    "finally , we have studied the relation between the properties of the critical casimir force and the breaking of the capillary bridge .",
    "it turns out that the point of breaking of the bridge is rather related to the inflection point than to the minimum of the force . to support this observation ,",
    "we have given some general arguments , which suggest that the link between the inflection point of the critical casimir force and breaking of the capillary bridge should be present for a wide range of systems .",
    "the existence of such a link would be very useful because typically the calculation of the magnetization profile is much more expensive numerically than determining the critical casimir force",

    "other possibilities require only minor modifications of the calculations presented below .      instead of our original model ,",

    "we will apply the limit @xmath103 , which puts all pairs of spins coupled with the energy @xmath101 or @xmath102 in the same or the opposite state , respectively . because one spin in each of the added rows is already fixed , the above limit fixes all additional spins .",

    "<S> we consider two  dimensional ising strip bounded by two planar , inhomogeneous walls . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneity of each wall is modeled by a magnetic field acting on surface spins . </S>",
    "<S> it is equal to @xmath0 except for a group of @xmath1 sites where it is equal to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneities of the upper and lower wall are shifted with respect to each other by a lateral distance @xmath3 . using exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix , we study both the lateral and normal critical casimir forces as well as magnetization profiles for a wide range of temperatures and system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the lateral critical casimir force tends to reduce the shift between the inhomogeneities , and the excess normal force is attractive . upon increasing the shift @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> we observe , depending on the temperature , three different scenarios of breaking of the capillary bridge of negative magnetization connecting the inhomogeneities of the walls across the strip . </S>",
    "<S> as long as there exists a capillary bridge in the system , the magnitude of the excess total critical casimir force is almost constant , with its direction depending on @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> by investigating the bridge morphologies we have found a relation between the point at which the bridge breaks and the inflection point of the force . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple argument that some of the properties reported here should also hold for a whole range of different models of the strip with the same type of inhomogeneity . </S>"
