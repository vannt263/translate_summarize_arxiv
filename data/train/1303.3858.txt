    "the noble gas liquids have become a very attractive media for particle detection .",

    "while helium has been proposed@xcite , as well , as a target material for studies of neutrinos and dark matter , it has yet to be employed in such an application for a number of reasons .",
    "but because of the possibility that dark matter may consist of wimps of lower mass than previously expected , in the range of 10  gev or below , there is some reason to consider detectors that could provide better sensitivity in this low mass range . in that regard ,",
    "it is natural to consider the advantages that liquid helium might provide over the heavier liquefied noble gases currently being used . to this end",

    "dark matter particles are expected to have a velocity distribution up to the escape velocity from the galaxy of 680  km / s , the recoil energy of a helium nucleus will extend up to the 100  kev for 10  gev wimps .",
    "+ the heavy liquefied noble gases , argon and xenon , are being used as dark matter detectors since they possess a number of desirable properties . as cryogenic liquids",
    "they can be made with very high purity , they are reasonably dense so self shielding of background radiation is possible , and they have high scintillation yields being transparent to their own emission . furthermore , an electric field can be used to separate electrons from positive ions produced by ionization .",
    "charge collection provides another valuable channel for identifying the nature of the radiation stopped in the liquid .",
    "+ liquid helium possesses some of these attributes of the heavier noble gas liquids but suffers as a potential dark matter detector for a number of reasons .",
    "1 ) scintillation from helium occurs at a higher energy , consisting of a broad distribution peaking at 16  ev .",
    "no material except for helium itself is transparent at this energy , requiring for detection of scintillation either the use of a wavelength shifter or the placement of the euv detector directly within the containment volume of the helium .",
    "additionally , because of the larger w - value of helium than the heavier noble gases , fewer photons are emitted per unit of energy deposition .",
    "2 ) the use of liquid helium requires operating at much lower temperatures with the attendant technical cryogenic complexities .",
    "3 ) because of its low density liquid helium provides poor self shielding of background radiation .",
    "4 ) since electrons form bubbles and positive ions form snowballs in liquid helium@xcite , the mobility of charges is significantly different in helium compared as to that of heavier noble gas liquids .",
    "not withstanding the challenges presented by these features , the potential benefit that helium , because of its low mass , brings to a search for light - mass dark matter particles makes the study of its properties in this regard of some interest .",
    "hence this discussion of the scintillation efficiency of helium to low - energy nuclear recoils .",
    "we are unaware of any measurements or estimates of the emission efficiency of helium for low energy incident particles and use what is known about helium - helium scattering and the scintillation of liquid helium upon stopping energetic alpha particles to fill this gap . + the knowledge of the effect of a helium atom with low recoil energy , from 1 to 100  kev , in liquid helium is sparse .",
    "there are two types of information that is useful in developing an understanding what happens should a wimp scatter from a helium atom .",
    "1 ) measurements exist on the ionization produced by he - he scattering in gases at the relevant energies . from this data it is possible to make some estimates of the likely consequence of wimp scattering in the liquid .",
    "2 ) from what is known about processes that occur along the track of an energetic alpha particle stopped in liquid helium it is possible to evaluate the likely consequences of processes that lead to quenching at lower energies .",

    "section iv contains a calculation of the expected scintillation efficiency of a helium recoil as compared to the scintillation from an electron of the same energy , while section v discusses the scintillation from electrons and compares charge collection from electron events and nuclear recoils .",
