    "pump light is provided by a continuous wave laser with 671  nm wavelength , which polarization is diagonal , i.e. has equal intensity in the horizontal and vertical polarization components . for the independent preparation of two classical pump fields with tunable relative phase",
    "we utilize a sagnac polarization interferometer as outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) .",
    "one of the mirrors can be tilted to allow for spatial alignment of the orthogonally polarized beams propagating clock- and counterclockwise through the interferometer .",
    "the relative phase of the two spatially separated beams is controlled by a quarter - wave plate and a half - wave plate after recombination of the clock- and counterclockwise propagating beams .",
    "finally , a polarizer selects only the horizontal polarization components , allowing for efficient excitation of the te pump modes in the coupler .",
    "this pump preparation setup allows for a very high stability of the phase difference between the two beams since they travel almost the same optical paths in the interferometer .",
    "no additional stabilization of the interferometer was used .    to generate the photon pairs ,",
    "the two pump beams are coupled to the sample by one microscope objective as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) . to fulfill the phase - matching conditions , the sample was heated to approximately 371  c using an oven with three independent heating elements controlled by a high precision temperature controller ( stanford research systems ptc10 ) . to control the phase mismatch ,",
    "the temperature in the oven was changed .",
    "a temperature difference of 0.1 c corresponds to a change of the phase mismatch of about 85/m or @xmath37 , with @xmath50 being the coupling constant of the signal and idler modes . at the end of the sample , signal and idler",
    "photons and the remaining pump were extracted by another microscope objective and separated by a dichroic mirror .",
    "the pump coupling was continuously monitored with a silicon camera ( philips spc900nc ) .",
    "furthermore , an interference filter with fwhm of 12  nm ( thorlabs fb1340 - 12 ) was used to filter the photon pairs around the degeneracy wavelength of 1342  nm .    to analyze the quantum states we perform quantum tomography in the polarization basis @xcite . to this end",
    "we transform the state , which is generated in the spatial basis of the two waveguides , into the polarization basis with the interferometer depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](c ) . in the image plane of",
    "the out - coupling microscope objective the photons from the two waveguides , which are both tm polarized , are separated by a d - shaped mirror .",
    "the polarization of one arm is rotated to te and the two beams are recombined with a polarizing beam splitter . to compensate any path difference between the two polarization components we additionally installed an adjustable delay line .",
    "quantum tomography is then performed by splitting the beam again using a 50:50 beamsplitter as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](d ) . in each arm",
    "a polarization analyzer is placed , after which the photons are coupled to single mode fibers and routed to single photon detectors ( idquantique id210 ) based on ingaas avalanche photo diodes .",
    "these are connected to a time - to - digital converter ( roentdek hm-1 ) to measure the two - photon coincidences with a timing resolution of 133  ps .",
    "the same setup was used to measure correlations only , which corresponds to a measurement with the polarization analyzers in the four possible combinations of horizontal and vertical polarization .",
    "although the measured coincidences described in the main part of this paper agree qualitatively with the analytically predicted quantum state , there exist some notable differences .",
    "for example , we could not achieve complete anti - bunching .",
    "this is due to technical details of the used sample and setup , the influence of which we investigate in the following part of the supplementary material . in particular , we discuss the influence of inhomogeneities introduced by the sample oven and the effect of the spectral filter used to select near - degenerate signal and idler photons .    to achieve phase matching the temperature of the sample had to be elevated to about 371 c. to this end , the sample is stored in an isolated oven , which , however , is open at the end facets to enable efficient light coupling .",
    "this leads to a temperature drop at the sample edges .",
    "hence , there is an additional phase mismatch @xmath51 , corresponding to the position - dependent temperature inhomogeneity .",
    "the temperature inhomogeneity is characterized by measuring the second - harmonic generation ( shg ) in dependence on the average sample temperature .",
    "the width of the obtained shg tuning curve is a measure of the inhomogeneity  @xcite . by introducing different setpoints for the three individual heating regions of our oven we minimized the width of the tuning curve .",
    "the optimal setting had temperature setpoints raised by 0.6  c in the outer heating regions with respect to the center of the oven .",
    "the actual temperature profile was estimated by carefully matching the measured tuning curve with the simulations that took the temperature inhomogeneity into account using a polynomial model @xcite .",
    "the resulting inhomogeneity @xmath51 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : inhom](a ) .",
    "the largest deviation of this curve from the value in the center of the sample corresponds to a temperature drop of about 1.5  c. the asymmetry of the inhomogeneity profile is caused by a shift of the sample towards the in - coupling objective , which was necessary to obtain optimal coupling of the pump beam through the thick insulation layers of the oven .    the analytic calculations in the main part of this paper are valid only for almost exactly degenerate photon pairs .",
    "in general , the photon pair states produced in our coupler are spectrally broad .",
    "to work in a near - degenerate regime , we placed an interference filter with a fwhm bandwidth of 12  nm after the oven . within this bandwidth ,",
    "all coefficients of the coupled mode equations ( eq .  1 of the main document )",
    "are constant , with exception of the phase mismatch , which due to narrow phase matching bandwidth is very sensitive to small changes in wavelengths .",
    "the total phase mismatch can be written as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mismatch for degenerate spdc defined by the overall sample temperature ( the value used in the main document ) , @xmath51 is induced by the temperature inhomogeneity along the sample , and @xmath54 is the additional phase mismatch induced by the non - degenerate signal and idler frequencies according to the experimentally measured dispersion for this sample  @xcite . here",

    "the generated maxima are widened and shifted towards smaller mismatches .",
    "inhomogeneous background is visible for larger mismatches .",
    "although these new features change the correlations , they are still similar to the analytic solution that we investigated in the main paper . in particular , for @xmath45 complete bunching and the generation of n00n states with @xmath65 is still possible , as evidenced by our experimental results .",
    "however , the generation of anti - bunched states in the analytical model relies on destructive interference leading to suppression of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 components .",
    "this interference is inhibited in the experiment , due to both the inhomogeneity and the finite spectral width . in agreement with our experimental results",
    "this perturbation of the interference leads to incomplete anti - bunching .    the two - dimensional density matrix of coupler output before filter @xmath68 with index @xmath69 representing all possible combinations of indexes @xmath70 and @xmath71 is calculated as follows : @xmath72^*\\ ] ] to obtain the two - dimensional density matrix after the filter",

    "the possibility of highly entangled state generation is indicated by the concurrence numbers approaching unity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inhom](e ) .    these simulations of the photon - pair source with inhomogeneity , taking into account the finite filter bandwidth , are in good agreement with our experimental results , explaining the differences from the analytic prediction .",
    "we point out that these experimental shortcomings are of purely technical nature and by no means a limitation of our source concept .",
    "the source performance could be improved by using a different oven design with better maintained temperature homogeneity , a shorter sample with stronger coupling that is more robust against temperature inhomogeneity , or a narrower spectral filter .",
    "the biphoton n00n state generated in a nonlinear directional coupler does not require precise phase matching , and is therefore robust in respect to moderate fabrication inaccuracies and temperature changes .",
    "in particular , the inhomogeneous temperature distribution along the sample and the presence of spectral filter only affect the generation efficiency , and not the spatial correlations .",
    "therefore the normalized analytic solutions from the main paper for the n00n state are not distinguishable from the simulation results discussed in the previous section .",
    "the experimentally measured spatial correlations for the n00n state are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bunching ] for different phase - matching conditions .",
    "it is evident that even relatively large temperature changes do not affect the correlations .",
    "the tolerance of the n00n state to perturbations is due to the fact that for an input phase mismatch of @xmath76 only the odd pump eigenmode of the coupler is excited , which enables spdc only to the even - odd pair of signal and idler eigenmodes .",
    "the ensuing anti - bunching in eigenmode space leads to the spatial bunching we observe .",
    "this effect does not rely on any interference effects or specific phasematching conditions , hence it is not disturbed by inhomogeneities along the waveguide",
    ". however , the quality of the n00n states would decrease if differences between the two waveguides in the coupler break the symmetry of the two - waveguide system .    the comparison of the experimentally measured density matrix for the n00n state [ fig .",

    "<S> the broad spectral distribution of photons generated by spdc  @xcite is filtered by a bandpass with 12  nm bandwidth to achieve nearly degenerate photon pairs .    </S>",
    "<S> the output of our photon - pair source is characterized by correlation measurements over the two possible spatial positions of the photons and by quantum state tomography  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : correlation ] shows selected correlation measurement results , which illustrate the tunability of our source . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : correlation](a ) we demonstrate output state tuning by changing the sample temperature for pump beams of equal phase . for a temperature of 370.6  c , corresponding to a phase mismatch of @xmath25 , strong anti - bunching </S>",
    "<S> is observed , resembling the bell - state @xmath41 . with growing temperature and phase mismatch , an increasing amount of bunching </S>",
    "<S> is measured , leading to a state with equal count numbers for all waveguide combinations and finally to dominant bunching . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in good qualitative agreement with our analytic theory , however , both bunching and anti - bunching are not complete and the wavefunction is broadened with respect to the mismatch . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to sample inhomogeneities and the influence of the finite bandwidth filter used in the experiments ( see supplementary material section 2 for details ) , which inhibit the complete destructive interference of the respective smaller components of the wavefunction .    </S>",
    "<S> steering of the generated photon pairs into just one waveguide occurs when either the @xmath42 or @xmath43 component of the wavefunction is suppressed and there is negligible contribution from the off - diagonal components . </S>",
    "<S> our analytic solution predicts that the steering can be controlled by either the phase mismatch @xmath1 or the phase difference between the pump beams @xmath2 . in the experiment </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate photon - pair steering for a pump phase difference of @xmath44 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : correlation](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> at a temperature of 370.6  c , signal and idler photons are leaving the structure together either from the first or from the second waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> when the temperature is changed to 371.4  c , most photon pairs are detected in waveguide  2 , even though both waveguides are pumped with the same intensity .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , for @xmath45 we find complete bunching of the generated photons depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : correlation](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this output state corresponds to a 2-photon n00n - state , similar to the theoretical result reported in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our case @xmath46 and @xmath47 for all mismatches since the excited odd pump mode always results in even - odd combinations of signal and idler modes , i.e. anti - bunching in eigenmode space , leading to spatial bunching . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally confirm this robustness for varying sample temperatures ( see supplementary material section 3 for details ) . to verify that the generated state corresponds to @xmath33 we performed quantum tomography . </S>",
    "<S> amplitude and phase of the measured density matrix are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tomography ] . the experimental fidelity with the ideal n00n state is @xmath48 ( see supplementary material section 3 for details ) , and the concurrence is @xmath49 .    in summary , we analyzed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally a new concept for a flexible biphoton quantum state source . </S>",
    "<S> photon pair generation in this source is based on spdc in a nonlinear directional coupler , which is pumped by two independent pump beams . </S>",
    "<S> the evanescent coupling of the generated photons allows for a much larger tunability of the generated quantum states compared to previous realisations using uncoupled waveguides as photon sources  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase difference between these pumps and the spdc phase mismatch provide two control parameters which are used to determine the produced quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> no post - processing is required . </S>",
    "<S> we show the flexibility of our approach by experimentally demonstrating the generation of anti - bunched and bunched bell - states , photon pair steering to one output , and the generation of maximally entangled n00n states . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the phase mismatch , which we controlled by changing the sample temperature , could also be tuned by changing the pump wavelength  @xcite . in this case , all - optical control of the output quantum state can be achieved by only altering the properties of the pump light . furthermore , although we use a bulk optical setup to prepare the two pump beams with variable phase difference , this functionality could also be integrated on a chip using electro - optic phase shifters  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the pump phase could be quickly modulated , enabling e.g. photon pair switching with telecom signal speeds . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the demonstrated concept can be an important building block for integrated quantum optics , increasing the flexibility in tailoring the output state .    </S>",
