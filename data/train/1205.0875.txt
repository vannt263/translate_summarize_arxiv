    "in order to study a hamiltonian system , it is essential to count on both fast and easy  to  compute techniques to determine the chaotic or regular nature of its orbits .    for two degrees of freedom ( hereafter d.o.f . ) , a technique based on a graphical treatment , like the poincar surfaces of section , should suffice to understand such a low dimensional problem .",
    "though generalized to three dimensional systems ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the graphical treatment shows fundamental constraints .",
    "therefore , non graphical methods seem to be the logical alternative to deal with systems of higher dimensionality .",
    "the concept of exponential divergence is thus introduced , and it is one of the two widespread ideas in chaos detection .",
    "the introduction of the lyapunov characteristic exponents ( lces ; see e.g.",
    "@xcite ) as well as its numerical implementation ( @xcite ) were a breakthrough contribution to the field .",
    "notice that the time of integration is limited , so we are able to reach just truncated approximations of the theoretical lces , i.e. lyapunov indicators , hereafter li ( @xcite , @xcite or @xcite and @xcite for reviews on the subject )",
    ". therefore , a drawback in the computation of the truncated values of the lces is their very slow convergence .",
    "nevertheless , a large number of variational techniques improve the li s performance , such as : the mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits ( megno ; @xcite ) ; the smaller alignment index ( sali ; @xcite ) and its generalized version , the generalized alignment index ( gali ; @xcite ) ; the fast lyapunov indicator ( fli ; @xcite , @xcite ) and its variant , the orthogonal fast lyapunov indicator ( ofli ; @xcite ) ; the spectral distance ( _ d _ ; @xcite ) and the dynamical spectras of stretching numbers ( ssns ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we include the relative lyapunov indicator ( rli ; @xcite ) , which is not based on the evolution of the solution of the first variational equations as the others , but on the evolution of two different but very close orbits .",
    "these are just a sample of all the variational chaos indicators ( cis ) widely used nowadays .",
    "they are the ones selected to be used in the forthcoming investigation .",
    "however , the record could indeed continue to include the average power law exponent ( aple ; @xcite ) ; the orthogonal fast lyapunov indicator of order two ( ofli@xmath1 ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which is a second order variational method ; the dynamical spectras of helicity or twist angles ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , evolutionary algorithms ( @xcite ) are also interesting alternatives .",
    "the other widespread idea in the field of cis is the analysis of some particular quantities ( e.g. the frequency ) of a single orbit . in this group",
    "we find the frequency map analysis ( fma ; @xcite ) and its variant , the frequency modified fourier transform ( fmft ; @xcite ) or other alternatives using fast fourier transform techniques ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , among others .",
    "nevertheless , we leave such family of indicators for a future comparison .    in order to compute the above variational cis efficiently ,",
    "it is fundamental to appropriately recognize numerical techniques for the integration of ordinary differential equations ( odes hereafter ) , which is the goal of the second part of this review .",
    "that is , in most of the problems that arise from the investigation of dynamical systems , as well as in every realistic model , the corresponding differential equations have to be solved by means of numerical techniques .",
    "its computational implementation should be as fast and precise as possible , in order to minimize both the numerical error and the computing time .",
    "among all numerical integrators , there are those which use recurrent power series in order to compute the solutions with a considerably high precision , and if we take advantage of the recurrence , the computing time is reduced ( @xcite & @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most used power series integrators is the taylor method ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite & @xcite ) , whose usefulness is at all means clear ; a particular implementation of which will be tested in this work .",
    "in @xcite the authors presented an integration package ( coded in c ) based on the taylor method for numerical integration of odes .",
    "they showed that this package turned out to be a very efficient integrator ( both in speed and precision ) when applied to the lorentz system , the forced pendulum model and the restricted three  body problem .",
    "the reason for selecting this particular package for our numerical experiments is that it implements several features which makes it a very versatile and nearly automatic package .",
    "this is due to the fact that the software encompasses the necessary subroutines to obtain a complete integrator , such as the inclusion of the so  called _ automatic differentiation _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , an algorithm to choose the order of the power series @xmath2 and the step size @xmath3 , the possibility to incorporate customized mathematical routines that use higher precisions than the standard _",
    "double precision _ , and even a fortran wrapper to call the integrator from a main program coded in fortran 77 .    taking into account those advantageous features of jorba & zou package ,",
    "we have decided to test their implementation of taylor method by analizing its performance when applied to three different dynamical problems for which we have compared its efficiency in both computing time and precision against that of other two widely used integrators .",
    "this work comprises two parts : in the first part of the paper , we make a comparative study of variational cis including the li , the rli , the megno , the _ d _ and the ssns , the fli and the ofli , the sali and the galis . in section [ section_introductioncis ]",
    ", we briefly introduce the above  mentioned cis and in section [ section_flows ] , we perform some experiments on the simple model of @xcite ( hereafter hh ) . there",
    ", we deal with the ci s final values and time evolution curves . in section [ final values ] , we study the reliability of the ci s thresholds in order to separate chaotic from regular motion , and also the level of dynamical information provided by the ci s final values .",
    "then , in section [ qualitative study - representative groups ] , we examine the capability of identifying periodicity and instabilities by means of the ci s time evolution , and the sensitivity of the cis on initial deviation vectors ( hereafter , i.d.v . ) . finally , we discuss the computing times and the advantage of the saturation times ( see section [ cpu - times ] ) . our purpose in this first part of the reported research",
    "is to extend the results shown in @xcite to a hamiltonian flow for mappings .",
    "then , in the second part of the paper , the comparison among numerical techniques for the resolution of odes in order to compute the cis just mentioned is presented .",
    "some of the features of jorba & zou package will be briefly described in section [ section_taylor ] .",
    "we introduce the results of testing the latter package over three different dynamical problems as follows : the first two problems ( section [ section_pot_tri ] and section [ section_quartic ] ) concern the computation of two dynamical indicators , i.e. the megno ( section [ section_megno_pot_tri ] and section [ section_megno_quartic ] ) and the li ( section [ section_lcn_pot_tri ] and section [ section_lcn_quartic ] ) .",
    "both problems require the rather accurate integration of the equations of motion along with their first variationals and , in the first case , some additional differential equations must be included .",
    "the third problem under consideration is the solely integration of the equations of motion ( see section [ section_solomov_pot_tri ] and section [ section_solomov_quartic ] ) .",
    "though this is a rather simple problem , it has many useful applications , such as the study of chaotic diffusion in phase space , where we need to follow accurately the coordinates on phase space over rather long time intervals . for the above  mentioned problems ,",
    "we have chosen two particular hamiltonian systems : the potential corresponding to an auto  consistent model of a triaxial elliptical galaxy @xcite , which actually involves complicated expressions for the odes , and a rather simpler one , a perturbed three dimensional quartic oscillator . in section [ section_trans_error ]",
    "we only compute the equations of motion for the three integrators to test the precision of the coordinates of phase space , and compare which one preserves better the position on the orbit .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in section [ section_discussion ] .",
    "the aim of the present section is to introduce the cis that we will use in the forthcoming investigation .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we describe only the main properties defined for flows .",
    "consider a continuous dynamical system defined on a differentiable manifold @xmath4 , where @xmath5 characterizes the state of the system at time @xmath6 and being the state of the system at time @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the state of the system after two consecutive time steps @xmath6 and @xmath9 will be given by the composition law : @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the tangent space of @xmath11 maps onto the tangent space of @xmath5 according to the operator @xmath12 and following the rule @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an i.d.v .",
    "the action of such operator at consecutive time intervals satisfies the equation :    @xmath15    if we suppose that our manifold @xmath4 has some norm denoted by @xmath16 , we can define the useful quantity :    @xmath17 called `` growth factor '' in the direction of @xmath18 .",
    "let us now say that @xmath19 with @xmath20 be an @xmath21dimensional hamiltonian , that we suppose autonomous just for the sake of simplicity .",
    "introducing the following notation :    @xmath22    the equations of motion can be written in a simple way like    @xmath23    let @xmath24 be an arc of an orbit of the flow ( [ megno1 ] ) over a compact energy surface : @xmath25 , @xmath26 with @xmath27constant , then    @xmath28    we can gain fundamental information about the hamiltonian flow in the neighborhood of any orbit @xmath29 through the largest lce ( llce , @xcite ) defined as :    @xmath30=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{t}\\ln\\lambda_t[\\gamma(\\mathbf{x_{0}};t ) ] \\label{megno2}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath31=\\frac{\\|d_{\\gamma}\\mathbf{\\phi}^t\\mathbf{w}\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is an `` infinitesimal displacement '' from @xmath29 at time @xmath6 .",
    "the fact that the llce ( and its truncated value , the so ",
    "called li@xmath33 $ ] for t , finite ) measures the mean exponential rate of divergence of nearby orbits is clearly understood when written eq .",
    "( [ megno2 ] ) in an integral fashion :    @xmath30=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}{1\\over",

    "now we are in condition to introduce the megno ( @xcite ) , @xmath34 $ ] , through the expression :    @xmath35={2\\over t}\\int_0^t{\\|\\dot{d}_{\\gamma}\\mathbf{\\phi}^{t'}\\mathbf{w}\\|\\over\\|d_{\\gamma}\\mathbf{\\phi}^{t'}\\mathbf{w}\\|}t'{\\rm d}t ' ,    \\label{megno_eq}\\ ] ]    which is related to the integral in eq .",
    "( [ megno3 ] ) ; i.e. , in case of an exponential increase of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , the quantity @xmath34 $ ] can be considered as a weighted variant of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ megno3 ] ) . instead of using the instantaneous rate of increase , @xmath38",
    ", we average the logarithm of the growth factor , @xmath39 .    introducing the time average :    @xmath40\\equiv{1\\over t}\\int_0^ty[\\gamma_q(\\mathbf{x_0};t')]{\\rm d}t ' ,    \\label{megno_avg_eq}\\ ]",
    "]    we notice that the time evolution of the megno can be briefly described in a suitable and unique expression for all kinds of motion .",
    "indeed , its asymptotic behavior can be summarized in the following way : @xmath41\\approx a_{\\gamma}t+b_{\\gamma}$ ] , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 for irregular , stochastic motion , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 for quasi  periodic motion .",
    "deviations from the value @xmath45 indicate that @xmath29 is close to some particular objects in phase space , being @xmath46 or @xmath47 for stable periodic orbits",
    "( resonant elliptic tori ) , or unstable periodic orbits ( hyperbolic tori ) , respectively ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the fli ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is a quantity intimately related to the llce ( and the megno , see @xcite ) , which is able to distinguish between chaotic ( weakly chaotic ) and regular motion and also , between resonant and non resonant motion ( @xcite , @xcite ) using only the first part of the computation of the llce .    on an @xmath21dimensional flow , we follow the time evolution of @xmath21 unit i.d.v .",
    "therefore , the fli at time @xmath6 is defined by the highest norm among the unit i.d.v .",
    "of the basis , as follows :    @xmath48.\\ ] ] for further details , refer to @xcite .    for both kinds of motion",
    ", the fli tends to infinity as the time increases , with completely different rates , though ( it behaves linearly for regular motion and grows exponentially fast for chaotic motion ) .    in the case of the ofli ( see @xcite ) , we take the component orthogonal to the flow for each unit i.d.v .",
    "of the basis at every time step :    @xmath49.\\ ] ]    this modification makes the ofli a ci that can easily distinguish periodicity among the regular component .",
    "the ofli for periodic orbits oscillates around a constant value , while for quasiperiodic motion and chaotic motion has the same behavior as the fli .",
    "the stretching number @xmath50 is defined as ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) :    @xmath51 where @xmath52 , i.e. the tangent vector at time @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath2 is the number of steps of integration @xmath55 ( in case of mappings , the @xmath56 ) in which the interval of integration is divided .",
    "therefore , the serie of @xmath50 with @xmath57 converges to the llcn .",
    "another way to obtain dynamical information is analyzing the spectra of the @xmath50 , i.e. the ssns .",
    "however , when the sample to study is very large , the single analysis of the orbits by means of the ssns is no longer reliable .",
    "thus , in @xcite the authors introduce the _",
    "d_.    the ssns are defined by the probability density of the values @xmath58 the @xmath50 can take :    @xmath59 with @xmath60 the total number of @xmath50 and @xmath61 the number of @xmath50 in the interval @xmath62 .",
    "there are certain properties of the ssns histograms that are worth mentioning :    1 .",
    "the dynamical spectra @xmath63 is invariant regarding the initial condition ( hereafter , i.c . ) along the same orbit ( invariant with respect to time ) .",
    "2 .   the dynamical spectra @xmath63 is invariant regarding the i.c . in a connected chaotic domain ( invariant with respect to space ) .",
    "finally , we define the _ d _ like :    @xmath64 ^ 2\\cdot ds,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the normalized number of @xmath50 corresponding to the unit i.d.v . @xmath66 which have values in the interval @xmath62 ( it is necessary to follow the evolution of two unit i.d.v . for each i.c .",
    "to compute the _ d _ ) .",
    "therefore , based on the properties of the ssns , it is straighforward to see that if the orbit is regular , the _ d _ tends to a constant non ",
    "zero value .",
    "if the orbit is chaotic , the _ d _ decreases approaching to zero .      in @xcite",
    "the author introduces the sali defining the alignment indices . the parallel alignment index :    @xmath67 and the anti ",
    "parallel alignment index :    @xmath68 where the @xmath16 is the usual euclidean norm . if the deviation vectors are normalized , then in case of chaotic motion : @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( the deviation vectors eventually become aligned with the same direction ) or @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( with opposite directions ) .",
    "if the motion is regular , @xmath73 and @xmath74 oscillate within the interval ( 0,2 ) .",
    "therefore , the sali is defined as the smaller of those indices :    @xmath75 the behavior of the sali for chaotic orbits follows an exponential law :    @xmath76 shown in @xcite , where @xmath77 with @xmath78 are the two largest lces of the orbit . if the orbit is regular , the sali oscillates within the interval ( 0,2 ) .    in @xcite",
    "the authors generalize the sali introducing an alternative way to compute it .",
    "they evaluate the quantity :    @xmath79 for each time step , where    @xmath80 with @xmath81 the wedge product of two deviation vectors .",
    "this represents the area of the parallelogram formed by the two deviation vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , the wedge product can be generalized to represent the volume of a parallelepiped formed by the deviation vectors @xmath84 with @xmath85 , of an @xmath21d.o.f .",
    "hamiltonian system , or a @xmath86dimensional symplectic mapping .",
    "therefore , the gali@xmath87 is defined as the volume of the @xmath88parallelepiped formed by the @xmath88 initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors @xmath89 , @xmath90 and can be computed through the wedge product as follows :    @xmath91    from eq .",
    "it is easy to see that if gali@xmath87(t ) tends to zero , this implies that the volume of the parallelepiped having the unit i.d.v . as edges also shrinks to zero , as at least one of the deviation vectors becomes linearly dependent on the remaining ones .",
    "thus , the behavior of the gali@xmath87(t ) follows the exponential law :    @xmath92\\cdot t},\\ ] ] where @xmath93 are the @xmath88 largest lces of the orbit .",
    "on the other hand , if gali@xmath87(t ) is different from zero as @xmath6 increases , the linear independence of the unit i.d.v .",
    "involved becomes clear .",
    "this second case corresponds to regular motion .",
    "regular orbits move on tori of dimension @xmath94 .",
    "in general , the dimension of the tori is @xmath21 because there are no resonances involved . the number of resonances diminishes the dimensionality of the manifold and , for periodic motion , the orbit moves on an invariant curve , i.e. a manifold of dimension one : @xmath95",
    ". the behavior of the gali@xmath87 is given by ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) :    @xmath96      the definition of the rli is straightforward ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consider the li for a given i.c . @xmath97 and after @xmath98 steps of integration : @xmath99 .",
    "the rli is thus defined according to the li difference for the `` base '' orbit and its `` shadow '' :    @xmath100 , where @xmath97 and @xmath101 are the i.c . for the base orbit and its shadow , respectively .",
    "the initial separation between the base orbit and its shadow , i.e. @xmath102 , is a free parameter .",
    "it is advisable to smooth the evolution curve of the li for the base orbit to eliminate fast fluctuations .",
    "thus , we define the rli as the total average each step of the integration :    @xmath103 @xmath55 being the step of integration .",
    "rli values for chaotic motion are several orders of magnitude higher than those associated with regular motion .",
    "there are important characteristics that make a ci suitable for a given study . in order to select the adequate cis ,",
    "it is useful to compare their performances according to these main aspects .",
    "therefore , it is essential to study the resolving power , i.e. the ci s capability to distinguish chaotic orbits from regular orbits , to describe the levels of chaoticity and the levels of regularity and to identify periodicity and stickiness .",
    "moreover , we need to analyze the integration time that the ci requires to identify clearly chaotic and regular orbits , i.e. the so  called speed of convergence . finally , it is also important to study the cpu or computing times of the cis , as we will see in section [ cpu - times ] .    the resolving power and the speed of convergence tell us about the possibility of gathering detailed dynamical information in short integration times .",
    "the cpu times tell us about the limitations of the numerical implementation of the algorithms to compute the cis .",
    "there are two ways of collecting this dynamical information .",
    "the first one is using the time evolution of the ci .",
    "the second one is by means of the ci s final value or its value at the end of the integration process .",
    "the information provided by the ci s time evolution is much more detailed than only a record of the final value .",
    "however , the study of large samples of ci s time evolution curves is not as efficient as the study of the corresponding final values despite the difference in the amount of information provided by each method .",
    "thus , the use of the ci s time evolution is recommended to analyze small samples of orbits or to study particular interesting cases . on the other hand ,",
    "we use the ci s final values to study extended regions of the phase space with large samples of orbits .",
    "the aim of the work done by @xcite was finding a `` cis function '' ( hereafter , cisf ) for mappings , which means a small package of cis that represents the most efficient way to gather dynamical information .",
    "there , the authors dealt with many cis characteristics previously mentioned , such as the identification of chaotic , regular and sticky orbits , the sensitivity to hyperbolicity and stability levels , the speed of convergence and the reliability on the thresholds .",
    "however , they did not consider their capability to identify periodic orbits , their performances dependence on i.d.v . and their computing times .",
    "in this section , we do not only extend their work considering a hamiltonian flow , the @xmath104d.o.f .",
    "hh potential , but we also increase the number of variational cis in the comparison , including the ofli and the gali@xmath87 with @xmath105 .    in section [ thresholds study ]",
    "we consider the robustness and reliability of the cis thresholds in distinguishing chaotic from regular motion .",
    "as we are interested in studying extended regions of the phase space , following the time evolution of the cis for every single orbit proves unsuitable .",
    "therefore , it is very important to count on thresholds that make a confident distinction between chaotic and regular motion .",
    "final values are required for big samples of orbits whereas the time evolution of the cis is the most efficient way to study small samples of orbits or individual orbits . in section [ qualitative study - statistical sample ]",
    "we deal with the cis final values and in section [ qualitative study - representative groups ] we deal with the cis time evolution .",
    "we analyze the capability of the cis to identify periodicity ( section [ periodicity ] ) and the sensitivity of the methods on dynamic instabilities ( section [ instabilities ] ) using the cis time evolution , and the cis dependence on the i.d.v .",
    "( section [ initial deviation vectors ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ cpu - times ] we briefly discuss the computing times of the different cis .",
    "all the computations in the investigation were done using the following configuration .",
    "hardware : cpu , 2 x dual xeon 5450 , dual core 3.00ghz ; m.b .",
    ", intel s5000vsa ; ram , 4gb(4x1 gb ) , kingston ddr2 , 667mhz , dual channel . software : gfortran 4.2.3 .",
    "the computation of the cis was accomplished by means of a single code we are developing , the so  called _ la plata variational indicators code _ ( lp  vicode ) .",
    "the code uses the dopri8 routine .",
    "we use the following configuration for the rest of section [ section_flows ] for the computation of the experiments unless stated otherwise : we record the data every @xmath106 units of time ( hereafter u.t . ) until a final integration time of @xmath107 u.t . the initial separation taken for the calculation of the rli",
    "is @xmath108 ( @xcite ) .",

    "is the canonical basis .",
    "let us recall that it is important to keep the same i.d.v .",
    "for the whole sample along the single experiments because some dependency of the cis on the i.d.v . may be found ( @xcite ) . in section [ qualitative study - representative groups ]",
    "we deal with such dependence .",
    "we start considering the reliability on the thresholds because they are essential to study the resolving power and the speed of convergence by means of the cis final values in section [ qualitative study - statistical sample ] .",
    "the following study is undertaken on the 2d hh potential on an energy surface defined by @xmath110 .",

    "the well  known 2d hh system is described by the hamiltonian :    @xmath115 where @xmath116 are the usual phase space variables .",
    "we applied the time ",
    "dependent threshold of the li ( table [ tablethreshold ] ) with @xmath6 as the time .",
    "it is known that an empirical adjustment of the li s theoretical threshold is strongly advisable , in particular when studying large samples of orbits . yet",
    ", our choice here is to avoid this fine tunning and to consider the raw theoretical estimation for the sake of a fair comparison .",
    "the critical value used for the rli ( table [ tablethreshold ] ) was computed following @xcite and the remarks discussed in @xcite .",
    "the way to determine the time ",
    "dependent threshold for the _ d _ is not known yet , thus it is not considered in this section .    in the case of the megno ,",
    "the threshold is a fixed value ( table [ tablethreshold ] ) which also needs an empirical adjustment .",
    "however , as we did for the li , we use the theoretical fixed value .    for the sali",
    "there are two thresholds commonly used , namely , @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in between",
    ", the orbits are called `` sticky chaotic '' .",
    "nevertheless , we consider them also as chaotic orbits .",
    "then , the threshold to be analyzed is @xmath118 , which separates regular orbits from chaotic and sticky chaotic ones . once again , this is done to avoid any advantages in taking more than one critical value .",
    "the threshold associated with the fli or the ofli ( sometimes used with two thresholds also , see @xcite ) is time  dependent and follows the formulae presented in table [ tablethreshold ] .",
    "finally , we define the thresholds for the galis .",
    "the hh potential is a 2d.o.f .",
    "hamiltonian system and we can compute three galis : the gali@xmath119 , the gali@xmath120 , and the gali@xmath121 . in order to establish their thresholds for large samples of orbits , we considered the formulaes for chaotic motion first : gali@xmath122 , gali@xmath123 , and gali@xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the llce of the orbit ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite or section [ the sali ] of this paper for further details ) .",
    "the llce was approximated by the li , which has the threshold @xmath126 ( see table [ tablethreshold ] ) .",
    "then , the thresholds for the galis to study large samples of orbits are given in table [ tablethreshold ] .",
    "we are aware that the behaviors of the galis for regular motions change with the i.d.v .",
    "initially tangent to the torus .",
    "however , the selected time  dependent thresholds remain a good approximation to separate regular from chaotic motion .",

    "this change emulates a fine tunning of the critical value . here , we repeat the experiment in the hh potential with a slight modification and we find similar results to those showed in the above mentioned work for mappings .",
    "first , we recorded the time evolution of the difference between the percentages of chaotic orbits according to a change in the threshold by @xmath130 for the li , and used it to measure the robustness of the other cis thresholds .",

    "if the ratios are above one , it means that the robustness of the cis thresholds are worse than the li s .",
    "on the other hand , ratios below one mean that the cis thresholds work better in the experiment than the ones associated with the li .",
    "the variational cis were introduced to improve the performances of the li .",
    "therefore , we expect ratios below one , and this is the case for many of the cis .    the normalized time evolution of the difference between the percentages of chaotic orbits according to a change in the thresholds by @xmath130 is shown on the top panels of fig .",
    "[ thresholds ] .",
    "the weakness of the theoretical fixed threshold for the megno becomes evident ( green linepoints on the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ thresholds ] ) .",
    "this weakness is a logical consequence of the asymptotic nature of the threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "we find that the rli and the sali have very reliable thresholds ( i.e. ratios below 1 ) , despite their empirical nature ( red linepoints on the top left and top right panels of fig .",
    "[ thresholds ] for the rli and the sali , respectively ) , and the fli / ofli and the gali@xmath121 , as well ( blue linepoints on the top left panel of fig .",

    "the gali@xmath121 starts with a value higher than one , but after a short initial transient , its rate decreases below one .",
    "now we consider the percentages of chaotic orbits .",
    "the value of a final percentage of chaotic orbits is not as important as the approximation rate to that value .",
    "the former can be fixed by an empirical adjustment .",
    "the latter is a combination of the threshold s reliability and the efficiency of the indicator .",
    "therefore , it is not easy to adjust in order to improve the results . notwithstanding",
    "the relative importance of the cis final percentages of chaotic orbits , we would like to test the reliability of the thresholds given in table [ tablethreshold ] .",
    "we consider the percentage of chaotic orbits given by the li by @xmath107 u.t .",
    "( i.e. @xmath131% ) the `` true percentage '' of chaotic orbits .",
    "we support this idea because the li is the most tested ci in the literature and @xmath107 u.t .",
    "is a confident convergent time for this indicator .    to take these considerations into account we are going to normalize the time evolution of the percentage of chaotic orbits according to every method with the `` true percentage '' given by the li",
    "thus , values higher than 1 show percentages of chaotic orbits higher than the `` true percentage '' given by a confident value of the li .",
    "the time evolution of the percentage of chaotic orbits according to the thresholds of table [ tablethreshold ] normalized by @xmath131% is shown on the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ thresholds ] .",
    "the disagreement with the li s final percentage of chaotic orbits ( see the bottom left panel of fig . [ thresholds ] ) forces an immediate empirical adjustment of the megno s threshold .",
    "actually , on considering the recommendations of @xcite , a threshold value close to @xmath132 seems to be more appropriate .",
    "the sali has the robustest threshold according to the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ thresholds ] ( red linepoints ) , as we have just seen .",
    "however , the convergency of both sali and gali@xmath121 s to the li s final percentage of chaotic orbits ( see the red and violet linepoints on the bottom right panel of fig . [ thresholds ] for the sali and the gali@xmath121 , respectively ) is slower than the convergency of the rli and the fli / ofli ( see the red and blue linepoints on the bottom left panel of fig . [ thresholds ] for the rli and the fli / ofli , respectively ) .",
    "the final percentages of the rli and the fli / ofli are higher than that of the li , though .",
    "nevertheless , the final percentage of chaotic orbits can be fixed with a small adjustment of their thresholds , as previously mentioned .",
    "thus , among the above  mentioned cis , the rli and the fli / ofli show the most reliable thresholds in the experiment and , on comparison , the fli / ofli s threshold seems to work better .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     using a saturation value for some methods has several advantages which were studied in this work ( section [ qualitative study - statistical sample ] ) , like recovering the chaoticity levels with the times of saturation .",
    "furthermore , there is also a numerical advantage with such kind of methods .",
    "if the orbit reaches the saturation value of the ci , the computation can be stopped , thus reducing the cpu ",
    "time ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . on fig .",
    "[ cputimes - sattimes ] , we tried to measure such relationship .",
    "therefore , we computed the cpu ",
    "time gained due to the percentages of orbits that reach the corresponding saturation value .",
    "this relation gives an idea of how much efficient an indicator is .",
    "for example , with a @xmath133 of orbits that reach the saturation value @xmath134 , the sali gains less than @xmath135 of the cpu ",
    "time , the gali@xmath119 and the gali@xmath120 gain around @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively and the fli and the ofli gaining between @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "although the gali@xmath121 shows higher percentages of orbits that reach the associated saturation value ( @xmath134 ) , the cpu ",
    "time gained is not as high as that for the fli or the ofli .",
    "c    finally , this experiment shows that the fli / ofli is the most efficient method because it gains most computing time by means of a succesful implementation of the saturation values .",
    "here we summarize the main features of the software package that integrates odes using the taylor method ( ` taylor ` hereafter ) that is described in detail in @xcite .    as mentioned in section [ section_introduction ] ,",
    "one of the main distinguishable features of this software is the use of the so - called _ automatic differentiation _ , which computes the derivatives of the functions involved up to an arbitrarily high order .",
    "this particular implementation of automatic differentiation generates its code from a file with the differential equations system , and makes the differentiation in an automatic fashion , without losing accuracy on the derivatives .",
    "there are many general purposes computer programs which build its code from a program ( @xcite , @xcite & @xcite ) , while others are built up by the user for a specific problem ( see for instance , @xcite for the @xmath139body problem ) .",
    "further alternatives to apply the taylor method can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the key point of the taylor method is the precise computation of the derivatives of @xmath140 , @xmath141 , which the automatic differentiation plays a crucial role .    the way in which ` taylor `",
    "operates can be summarized as follows : the package reads the differential equations system from a plain text file , and uses it to build the integrator ( for a full syntax and parameters list see `` taylor user s manual '' , which comes with the package ` taylor ` ) . `",
    "taylor ` subroutines are written in ansi c code .",
    "it includes the subroutines for the automatic differentiation , the time stepper , as well as step - size and order control .",
    "the subroutine which computes the automatic differentiation reads each equation from the file , decomposes the expression into binary or unitary operations and generates recurrences in order to compute the derivatives analytically ( for an example of some recurrences see @xcite , section 2 , proposition 2.1 ) .",
    "thus , the derivatives of the function @xmath142 up to an arbitrarily high order can be computed without losing accuracy . for a more detailed description of the software implementation",
    "see section 4 of @xcite .    for the calculation of the step size @xmath3 and the order of the method @xmath2 , `",
    "taylor ` uses variable - stepsize and variable - order algorithms .",
    "the package computes , for each time - step , the order @xmath143 that guarantees a truncation error of the order of a given threshold @xmath144 ( for simplicity , in the numerical computation sections we call it @xmath145 ) . with this value of @xmath143",
    "the step size @xmath146 is computed .",
    "these two values are chosen in such a way that not only the required precision @xmath145 is achieved but the number of operations needed to advance one time step is minimized .",
    "an interesting feature of taylor method , unlike other integrators , is that to increase accuracy , it requires much less work to increase the order @xmath2 than to reduce the step size @xmath3 .",
    "its explanation can be seen in @xcite , on section 3.3 .",
    "another useful feature of ` taylor ` is the possibility to implement easily the use of extended arithmetic , using high precision libraries like _",
    "gmp_. this is possible due to the implementation of abstract operations with a floating point type called ` my_float ` .",
    "then , in the header file , these operations are replaced by the ones corresponding to the mathematical library we are using ( the default is _ double _ ) .",
    "we considered a triaxial potential , corresponding to an auto - consistent model of elliptical galaxy @xcite , given by    @xmath147    where @xmath148 is the softened radius @xmath149 and @xmath150 with the softening parameter fixed at @xmath151 .",
    "the functions @xmath152 were computed from an @xmath139body simulation and fit with equations of the form    @xmath153    the adopted values for @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 are given in table 2    [ table_pot_tri_coefs ]    we adopted value @xmath158 for the system s energy ( which corresponds to an @xmath159-axis central orbit with period @xmath160 u.t . ) .",
    "we considered central orbits ( i.e. @xmath161 ) and , by defining @xmath162 , we took initial values for @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 which satisfy @xmath166 using a grid made of points which swept the values of @xmath163 and @xmath164 with a step of @xmath167 , yielding a total of 2080 orbits . the integrations were carried out for @xmath168 and @xmath169 u.t . , but only the results for @xmath170 are shown here since the same behavior is observed in both cases .",
    "we chose as @xmath171 in order to avoid a division by zero in the computation of the megno ( note that there is a @xmath6 in the denominators of eqs .",
    "[ megno_eq ] and [ megno_avg_eq ] ) , and @xmath172 in subsections [ section_lcn_pot_tri ] and [ section_solomov_pot_tri ] .",
    "the required tolerances were @xmath173 ( the same for both the absolute and relative tolerances ) .",
    "for all the computations done in this second part of the work we used variable - stepsize . for ` taylor `",
    ", we used the stepsize control method mentioned on @xcite , section 3.2.1 , and for dopri8 and bs their own stepsize control method , included on both programs .",
    "all the results presented here have been computed in a @xmath174dual xeon 5120 , dual core @xmath175 ghz .",
    "the skillful computation of the megno definitely requires an efficient integrator .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to confirm the superiority of ` taylor ` claimed out in @xcite . to this end ,",
    "the package was compared with other two well  known integrators : a runge - kutta 7/8 method , the so  called dopri8 @xcite , and the bulirsch - ster method ( bs ) @xcite .",
    "the results of the comparison regarding both speed and precision of the integrations performed by means of ` taylor ` , dopri8 and bs are presented in figure [ megno_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] , where we have plotted the respective cpu times and maximum energy errors for one out of ten i.c ..    the left side of figure [ megno_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] reveals that ` taylor ` is considerably slower than dopri8 and bs .",
    "its computation time is @xmath176 or @xmath177 times the time insumed by the other two integrators ( i.e. it s slower in a factor of @xmath176 , @xmath177 ) .",
    "when we look at the maximum energy error displayed on the right side of figure [ megno_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] , we observe that ` taylor ` is slightly more precise than dopri8 ( in a factor @xmath176 ) , while the errors arising from the integration by bs are about 2 orders of magnitude larger ( in a factor @xmath178 ) .",
    "therefore we can assert that although ` taylor ` is nearly as precise as dopri8 , it clearly demands much more computation time than both dopri8 and bs .",
    "thus , at least for this particular system of odes , the ` taylor ` package turns out to be a somewhat inefficient integrator .",
    "this is a surprising fact , since ` taylor ` showed up as a very competitive integrator in @xcite .",
    "however it seems that there are some particular features in these odes that could be conflictive for the ` taylor ` package .",
    "in fact , the differential equations for the megno    @xmath179    encompass the temporal variable @xmath6 in the expressions for @xmath180 and @xmath181 in the numerator and denominator , repectively . as a consequence , we infer that , at the beginning of the integration when @xmath6 is very small and near its end , when we consider a large period , we obtain large values of @xmath180 or @xmath181 , respectively . `",
    "taylor ` might compensate this effect by taking very small step sizes , and these two equations might be responsible for the inefficient performance of the package .    in order to test this conjecture we proceed to the computation of another dynamical indicator , namely , the li .",
    "this suits perfectly our needs , since only the equations of motion and their first variational ones are to be integrated , and the two equations ( [ megno_diff_eqs ] ) that calculate the megno are no longer involved .",
    "the task was carried out using the very same i.c . and",
    "parameters for the galactic model as those of the previous section and the same tolerance was imposed .",
    "the cpu times demanded by the computation of the li values and the resulting maximum energy errors are displayed in fig .",
    "[ lcn_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] .    regarding to the cpu time , ` taylor ` still remains slower than both dopri8 ( a @xmath182 factor ) and bs ( @xmath183 ) , but it is evident that the differences have decreased significantly , i.e. from a @xmath176 to @xmath182 factor .",
    "however , as long as the energy error is concerned , no significant dissimilarity from the results shown in figure [ megno_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] is observed .",
    "these results support our assumption that the equations for the megno decrease ` taylor ` s performance .",
    "in fact , the reduction of the system of odes by avoiding those required for the megno considerably dimished the difference between the computational times invested by the compared integrators . nonetheless , `",
    "taylor ` kept on being the least efficient , in discrepancy with the results given in @xcite , table 4 .    the question arises whether for integrating only the system of equations of motion , ` taylor ` succeds in showing its benefit regarding the speed of computation stated by @xcite , table 4 .",
    "this issue is addresed in the forthcoming subsection .      on the left of figure [ solomov_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ]",
    "it is displayed the cpu time insumed by ` taylor ` , dopri8 and bs for several i.c .",
    "when we integrate the equations of motion for the galactic model .",
    "the plot evinces that for this particular problem , ` taylor ` results slightly faster than both dopri8 ( a factor of @xmath184 ) and bs ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "regarding to the maximum error in the energy , a similar behavior is revealed on the right side of fig .",
    "[ solomov_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] , being ` taylor ` slightly more accurate than dopri8 and about 2 orders of magnitude more precise than bs .",
    "let us remark that when solving the three different sets of odes for this particular system ( the megno , the li and the equations of motion ) , ` taylor ` showed up to be as precise as dopri8 and much more precise than bs ; but as far as the required cpu times are concerned , only when integrating the equations of motion ` taylor ` turned out to be the best , in a smaller degree , though .",
    "the results achieved so far suggest that ` taylor ` is not well suited for dealing with systems involving variational equations or odes like the ones defining the megno , but it offers some advantage when only the equations of motion are integrated .    in fact",
    ", the ` taylor ` package consumes a quite significant amount of cpu time to compute the automatic differentiation , build the power series and evaluate them at the requested points .",
    "thus , it seems fair to wonder whether using this dynamical system for the comparison is a fortunate selection , due to the rather cumbersome expressions involved .",
    "in this section we present the results of the reproduction of the same numerical experiments for a somewhat simple dynamical problem , namely , a 3d quartic oscillator subject to a cubic perturbation of the form @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the perturbative parameter .",
    "therefore , the potential can be recasted as    @xmath188    for these experiments we adopted the energy value @xmath189 , for which the central @xmath159-axis orbit has a period of @xmath190 u.t . , and we constructed a lattice of i.c . by taking @xmath191 and values of @xmath159 and @xmath192 in the range @xmath193 and @xmath194 , with step - sizes @xmath195 , yielding @xmath196 ( i.e. @xmath197 ) .",

    "the tolerance was again set to @xmath173 .",
    "figure [ megno_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] ( left ) illustrates the computational cost for evaluating the megno in the current application .",
    "it can clearly be seen that ` taylor ` required nearly 3 times the cpu time demanded by dopri8 and 2.3 times than that taken by bs for the same task . in other words , ` taylor ` turned out to be from about @xmath201 to @xmath132 times slower than the other two integrators , a factor of the same or even larger order than the one observed for the triaxial potential .",
    "the results in figure [ megno_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] ( right ) show that , in this case , ` taylor ` is more accurate than dopri8 in a @xmath202 factor , that is a difference of approximately 1 order of magnitude in the conservation of energy . on the other hand , the same difference as in the case of the triaxial potential ( see figure [ megno_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] , right )",
    "is attained in the current application when ` taylor ` is compared with bs performance , i.e. 2 orders of magnitude in favor of the former ( more specifically a factor @xmath178 ) .",
    "although ` taylor ` allows better energy conservation , the time required to compute the megno is too long to be a preferable alternative to the other two integrators , even when we are dealing with such a plain system as a perturbed quartic oscillator .",

    "[ lcn_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] .    from figure [ lcn_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] ( left )",
    "it can be deduced that ` taylor ` was about @xmath203 times slower than dopri8 for the li computation , which is a remarkably smaller difference than that observed for the cpu times for obtaining the megno .    regarding the resultant maximum energy error , fig .",
    "[ lcn_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] ( right ) reveals a quite different behavior from that observed in the case of the megno evaluation .",
    "indeed , though there is still a difference of about 2 orders of magnitude between ` taylor ` and bs ( a @xmath204 factor in favor of ` taylor ` ) , the difference between ` taylor ` and dopri8 grew considerably ( to a @xmath205 ) compared to that shown on the right side of figure [ lcn_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] .",
    "therefore , this result differs from the one obtained for the triaxial potential , where the differences in energy preservation turned out to be almost the same in the three problems analysed , namely , the computation of the megno and the li values and the integration of the equations of motion .",
    "this section is aimed at comparing both speed and precision when only the equations of motion are computed for the quartic oscillator by testing again the three integrators under study .",
    "as the left side of figure [ solomov_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] shows , ` taylor ` become the fastest one .",
    "in fact , a similar behaviour with respect to dopri8 is observed as the one achieved for the galactic model ( i.e. ` taylor ` is just @xmath185 times faster than dopri8 ) , but the difference is greater when comparing ` taylor ` with bs in a @xmath206 factor .    concerning the maximum energy error presented on the right side of figure [ solomov_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] ,",
    "the differences between ` taylor ` and bs slightly decreased , falling below the 2 orders of magnitude , i.e. nearly a @xmath207 factor . moreover ,",
    "this is the same difference between ` taylor ` and dopri8 results , the error curve for the latter lying behind the one corresponding to the bs method .",
    "thus , it should be highlighted that , when we solved the three different sets of odes ( those for the megno , the li and the equations of motion ) for the perturbed quartic oscillator , ` taylor ` was more accurate than dopri8 and bs . in terms of cpu times ,",
    "` taylor ` was comparable to dopri8 and faster than bs when integrating solely the equations of motion , and required the largest computational time when determining both the megno and the li values .    again",
    ", the results obtained for the perturbed quartic oscillator indicate that ` taylor ` is not well suited for systems involving variational equations or odes like the ones defining the megno . however , it does offer some advantages when only the equations of motion are integrated .",
    "the ` taylor ` performance slowdown is still not fully understood and it is subject to further study ( extracted from a private conversation with ngel jorba ) .    as mentioned in section [ section_introduction ]",
    ", the study of diffusive processes in phase space requires a fast and , above all , very reliable method for integrating the equations of motion of such a system .",
    "the experiments performed herein point out that ` taylor ` is more efficient than the other two integrators considered , at least as far as the integration of the equations of motion is concerned .",
    "thus , we are bound to advance that it is the best candidate for studies on the accurate determination of coordinates in phase space .",
    "this issue will be discussed in section [ section_trans_error ] .      in the previous section",
    ", we obtained the precision on the energy for a fixed value of @xmath145 .",
    "the aim of this section is to obtain a value of @xmath145 for which we calculate a precision of @xmath208 in the preservation of the energy .",
    "in order to do this we used the following steps : first , we fix the precision on the energy @xmath209 , then we set an initial value for @xmath210 and , by decreasing @xmath145 by one unit ( i.e. @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , etc . ) , we continue iterating until we obtain a value of @xmath145 for which @xmath215 . table 3 shows the results obtained .",
    "[ tol_for_different_integrators ]    as indicated in table 3 , considerable less precision in @xmath145 is required by ` taylor ` to achieve the same error on the energy preservation .",
    "note that , in the case of @xmath216 , the three values of @xmath145 given by ` taylor ` are exactly the same .",
    "this is due to how ` taylor ` selects the order @xmath2 and the stepsize @xmath3 ( for further details , see @xcite , section 3.2 ) .",
    "a brief explanation is that the order @xmath2 depends on @xmath145 and the stepsize @xmath3 basically depends on @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , for all the values of @xmath145 which result in the same value of @xmath2 , we will obtain the same @xmath3 , in an identical integration .",
    "this step - like behaviour can be seen in figure [ taylor_step - like_behaviour ] .    here",
    "we can see that , for @xmath217 in dopri8 and @xmath218 for bs , as both integrators saturate , due to their intrinsic precision , it is useless to compare them beyond those values .",
    "the step - like nature of ` taylor ` s curve means that , if we take a given value of @xmath208 , we can increase the tolerance up to the largest value in the same step .",
    "for instance , seeing figure [ taylor_step - like_behaviour ] , if we ask @xmath219 , we can increase @xmath145 up to @xmath220 . or",
    ", from another perspective , if we change from @xmath221 to @xmath222 , we win approximately 3 orders of magnitude , while dopri8 and bs will improve less than 1 order of magnitude .",
    "in this section we will try to elucidate which of the three integrators under study permits the most precise determination of the coordinates in phase space for a given initial value problem when investigating diffusive processes .    to this end ,",
    "the integration using ` taylor ` with extended precision arithmetic ( i.e. gmp library with a mantissa of 256 bits , see ` http://gmplib.org/ ` for details ) could be considered as the `` exact '' solution against which to contrast the result of integrating the equations of motion by means of the three methods .",
    "this choice is based on the results obtained in @xcite , section 5.1.4 .    of the @xmath223 i.c .",
    "used in section [ section_quartic ] , in order to perform the accuracy test , the perturbed quartic oscillator was integrated with those which the megno classified as regular ( i.e. 1039 orbits ) .",
    "the reason for that selection is that it is useless to compute the error on the coordinates of chaotic orbits , because of their sensibility to the i.c .",
    ", resulting in too different final coordinates for each integrator .",
    "the results were then compared to the extended precision approximation .",
    "the integration was made for several tolerances , ranging from @xmath108 to @xmath134 , and stopped at @xmath198 u.t .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the error vector in configuration space provides an idea of the precision of the integrator applied .",
    "nonetheless , the magnitude of its component along the direction normal to the trajectory would be more relevant in the present application is , since the error in the tangential direction could be assimilated as a mere shift of the integration time , having no impact on a diffusion analysis .",
    "if we define @xmath224 as the angle between the position error vector and the tangent line of the actual orbit , given by the velocity vector of the `` exact '' trajectory , that is ,    @xmath225    the tangential and transverse components of the error can be recasted as @xmath226 and @xmath227 , respectively .",
    "table 4 clearly shows the absolute value of the position error and its component in the transverse direction as a percentage of the whole for several tolerances . to get these results we considered all the i.c .",
    "mentioned above , and computed the errors in the following way :    @xmath228    where @xmath229 clearly represents the fraction of the error on the transverse direction .",
    "[ table_trans_err_tol ]    table 4 reveals that the major component of the error lies along the trajectory direction .",
    "the percentages for ` taylor ` and dopri8 can be considered comparable ( @xmath230 ) , although the latter presents less dispersion , while bs gives higher values ( @xmath231 ) .    taking into account the same orbits as in the previous table , an histogram for each integrator can be built , considering @xmath173 , as shown in figure [ quartic_histograms ] .",
    "+    the histograms show that ` taylor ` has the majority of its orbits below the mean value , as well as bs , while dopri8 has a near homogeneity in the interval @xmath232 .    in the attempt to determine which of the three integrators is the most precise one , the arithmetic mean ( for @xmath173 ) of the absolute value of the total error",
    "is computed to yield ,    @xmath233    and that of the component in the transverse direction    @xmath234    therefore , ` taylor ` results to be more accurate when computing the coordinates of phase space than both dopri8 and bs , as already shown in table 4 . in fact , the precision is really good , since it is about 2 orders of magnitude more precise than dopri8 and 6 orders of magnitude more accurate than bs .",
    "these results support our previous assumption that ` taylor ` is a very efficient alternative when dealing with problems which involve the solution of the equations of motion and requires the value of the coordinates to be quite precise .",
    "in this work , we reviewed the performances of some variational cis as well as the numerical techniques for their computation over different known dynamical problems .",
    "as regards the comparison of the variational indicators studied here , we can mention some particular points to take into consideration when selecting appropriate tools to study a certain dynamical problem . notwithstanding the excellent performances shown by some techniques , it is advisable to avoid using only one indicator of chaos . on the other hand",
    ", it is imperative to reduce the number of cis in the package . therefore , we aimed at selecting a cisf for a general hamiltonian system .    in the previous experiments the rli and the fli / ofli showed the robustest thresholds .",
    "the ofli seems to be a reliable suggestion if we can use its time evolution , i.e. to study small samples of orbits or for single analysis .",
    "the ofli and the megno are the recommended techniques to identify periodicity or stability levels , respectively . the gali@xmath119 ( or the sali ) with a proper checking of the i.d.v . because of their very low final values , @xcite is also appropriate for identifying periodicity , and the gali@xmath87 for identifying regular motion on tori of lower dimensionality ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . furthermore , to analyze large samples of orbits by means of the final values , a combination of the fli / ofli and the gali@xmath121 ( or the gali@xmath0 for a @xmath21d.o.f .",
    "hamiltonian system ) seems to be useful to describe the divided phase space of the hh potential .",
    "the fli / ofli final values did not show spurious structures in the regular component within the experiments .",
    "the gali@xmath121 with the help of the corresponding saturation times is useful both to rough out and describe thoroughly the chaotic components .",
    "finally , we ordered the cis studied according to their cpu  times with a fixed integration time .",
    "the li is the most economical in computational time followed closely by the megno and the _ d _ is the most cpu  time consuming .",
    "however , the li has a rather low speed of convergence .",
    "we also showed that the fli / ofli is less time  consuming due to an efficient implementation of the saturation values .",
    "the fli / ofli proved to be the most versatile technique tested .",
    "the fli showed a robust threshold and good performances using the final values to study large samples of orbits and the ofli showed good performances if we use its time evolution for single analysis .",
    "nevertheless , some techniques can be selected with the fli / ofli to give richer descriptions of the system .",
    "the previous results showed that a reliable suggestion for a cisf for the hh potential and for a general hamiltonian flow is composed of the fli / ofli techniques , the megno and the gali@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , there is no reason to believe that such cisf can be only applied to hamiltonian flows ; it can also be used in mappings , thus improving the efficiency of the cisf selected in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the above  mentioned cisf can be applied to a general hamiltonian system .",
    "we also present the results of a comparative study of the ` taylor ` package developed by @xcite against two other well  known and widely used integrators , namely , dopri8 and bs .",
    "the three methods were applied to diverse dynamical problems and different vector fields as well , with the aim of determining their relative efficiency .",
    "both speed and accuracy were tested for three dynamical problems : the computation of a fast indicator as the megno , that of the largest lcn ( i.e. li ) , and the integration of the equations of motion for a model of triaxial galaxy and a perturbed quartic oscillator .",
    "the numerical experiments performed , showed that one of ` taylor ` s strongest features is its capacity to preserve the energy integral . in this regard",
    ", in the more complex system ( the triaxial potential ) , dopri8 showed to be nearly as accurate as ` taylor ` and both turned out to be about two orders of magnitude more accurate than bs . in the case of the perturbed quartic oscillator",
    ", it resulted about two orders of magnitude more precise than both dopri8 and bs .",
    "a characteristic found in this experiments is that the energy preservation yielded by the use of ` taylor ` turned out to be problem - independent for a given vector field , in contrast to what occured when dopri8 was applied .",
    "moreover , the computational effort demanded by the three integrators was subjected to comparison to conclude that ` taylor ` was considerably slower than dopri8 and bs while computing the megno .",
    "the differences in the required cpu time decreased significantly for the computation of the li , but even in this case ` taylor ` remained the slowest one .",
    "when dealing with the integration of the equations of motion , a change in the behavior was observed , ` taylor ` advantaging in speed both dopri8 and bs ( figs .",
    "[ solomov_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] and [ solomov_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] ) .",
    "although this is not a thorough test , in the light of the results obtained we can say that ` taylor ` is rather slow when the variational equations or the ones defining the megno are integrated . in general , its efficiency seems to diminish as the complexity of the system of odes increases .    however , not only the dynamical problem being attacked , but also the vector field under study impact on the differences in the cpu times required by the different integrators . therefore , for instance , while computing the megno the time differences between ` taylor ` and the other two integrators are greater for the perturbed quartic oscillator than those for the triaxial potential ( as seen in figs .",
    "[ megno_pot_tri_tcpu_maxerr ] and [ megno_quartic_tcpu_maxerr ] ) .    in an attempt to unravel the observed behavior we adventure to say that whenever dealing with a plain formulae for the vector field , such as in the case of the perturbed quartic oscillator , ` taylor ` takes too much time for computing the recurrences for the automatic differentiation , determining each coefficient and building the power series , while the other integrators only evaluate the quite simple functions defining the system of odes in some points conveniently chosen , thus resulting more efficient than ` taylor ` .",
    "for a more complex system of odes , like the ones involved in the model of a triaxial potential , the mere evaluation of the field in dopri8 or bs would be not as fast as for the quartic oscillator which only encompasses polynomic expressions , causing their time differences with ` taylor ` to decrease .",
    "conversely , regarding the energy preservation the opposite behavior is observed , ` taylor ` advantaging dopri8 for the simpler vector field more than for the one defined by rather cumbersome expressions . in fact , in the case of the triaxial potential the obtained differences in @xmath235 between ` taylor ` and dopri8 are quite small ( barely reaching a factor of @xmath176 ) , while for the perturbed quartic oscillator the errors in the energy differ in a factor ranging from @xmath236 to @xmath204 ( i.e. in 2 orders of magnitude ) .",
    "let us say that the comparison against bs has been left behind since , even when bs demanded cpu times comparable to those required by dopri8 , the resulting energy preservation in all cases was not as good as that obtained by any of the other two integrators .    in the light of our experiments ,",
    "a crosswise situation was observed when comparing both the computational effort and the energy preservation for the integrators being applied to vector fields of different complexity .",
    "consequently , generally speaking the supremacy of one integrator over the other could not be claimed out .",
    "however , what remains clear is that the ` taylor ` package results unsuitable for computing the megno or integrating the variational equations ( this could also be seen on gerlach & skokos [ 2010 ] ) , where dopri8 shows up as a good choice to perform the required integrations ( let us remark that on the previous papers @xcite and @xcite , for instance , the dopri8 subroutine was used for this purpose ) .    on integrating only the equations of motion , the analysis of the accuracy reached by means of the three integrators exposed that the `",
    "taylor ` package turned out to be the most efficient of the three . in this application , not only the final errors in the position vector but also their component in the perpendicular direction to the orbit were compared in order to estimate how much the trajectory obtained departed from the current one . there , ` taylor ` was found to be considerably more precise than both dopri8 and bs ( about 2 and 6 orders of magnitude , respectively ) .",
    "thus , considering that the ` taylor ` package also revealed itself as advantageous regarding the required cpu time and the preservation of the energy integral when integrating the equations of motion of the 3d perturbed quartic oscillator , we state that ` taylor ` is the most convinient tool to be used in those problems that only involve the integration of the equations of motion , such as the study of chaotic diffusion in phase space .    thanks to investigations like the presented above , we can make smart decisions about the most efficient group of cis and the appropriate numerical integrator to study a given system .",
    "nevertheless , a suitable tool should attend the preceeding studies .",
    "thus , in section [ section_flows ] we mentioned that the computing of the cis were accomplished with a code we are developing , the lp - vicode .",
    "the li , the rli , the megno , the d and the ssns , the sali and the galis and the fli and the ofli are already programmed for the systems tested , being such systems either a mapping or a flow .",
    "they are grouped in several modules , so the user can select the desired module to compute the preferred cis . moreover ,",
    "the integration routine used is the dopri8 .",
    "however , our final goal is to introduce a code with a growing cis database ( variational cis at first ) , where the user can easily program the model to study , and use the desired integrator .",
