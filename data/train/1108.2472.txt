    "in this paper , we develop a multi - scale theory for groups of diffeomorphisms in the context of image registration .",
    "the setting of _ large deformation diffeomorphic matching _ has been introduced in seminal papers @xcite and this approach has been applied in the field of computational anatomy @xcite .",
    "the initial problem deals with the diffeomorphic registration of two given biomedical images or shapes .",
    "an important aspect of this model is the use of reproducing kernel hilbert spaces ( rkhs ) of vector valued functions to define the lie algebra of the group of diffeomorphisms .",
    "although our context is very different from kernel based methods for machine learning @xcite , some analogies may be worth noticing .",

    "the action of the group @xmath9 on the objects space is denoted by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an element of the group and @xmath19 is an object .",
    "the distance function @xmath20 that enforces the matching accuracy is usually taken to be the square of the norm if the objects live in a normed vector space , _",
    "e.g. _ for images one would use the @xmath21 norm , @xmath22 .",
    "this minimization problem enables us to match images via geodesics on the group @xmath9 , if we endow @xmath9 with the right - invariant metric obtained by translating the inner product @xmath23 on the lie algebra @xmath2 to the other tangent spaces .",
    "more importantly by its action on the space of images , the right - invariant metric on the group induces a metric on the orbits of the image space and the final deformation is completely encoded in the so - called initial momentum @xcite .",
    "this initial momentum has the same dimension as the image .",
    "since it is an element of a linear space , statistics can also be done on it @xcite .",
    "a rkhs corresponding to a gaussian kernel is commonly used in practice .",
    "the choice of its standard deviation @xmath24 is an important problem and describes a trade - off between the smoothness of the deformation and the matching accuracy .",
    "indeed , a large standard deviation produces very smooth deformations with a poor matching accuracy of the structures having a size smaller than @xmath24 . on the contrary",
    ", a small standard deviation results in a good matching accuracy but the deformations may present undesirable very large jacobians @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a natural step to introduce a mixture of gaussian kernels with different standard deviations . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that such kernels outperform single gaussian kernels , when registering images containing features of interest at several scales simultaneously : they provide a good matching quality , while keeping the diffeomorphisms smooth .",
    "naturally , this introduces more parameters in the algorithm , which need to be tuned .",
    "practical insight about how to parametrize the scales and weights of multiple kernels are given in @xcite .",
    "the idea of using a mixture of kernels for matching is directly connected to @xcite , where it is proven that there is an equivalence between the matching with a sum of two kernels and the matching via a semi - direct product of two groups .",
    "the work on the metric underlying the lddmm methodology @xcite has also been followed up by @xcite , where the authors introduce the notion of a bundle of kernels and argue that this general framework can be used to deal with multi - scale lddmm . by passing , we prove that their approach reduces to the mixture of kernels .",
    "we give a self - contained and simple proof of this result based on lagrange multipliers and we develop an extension of @xcite , first to a finite number of scales and then to a continuum of scales .",
    "the paper is divided into three parts : the first part focuses on a finite number of scales while the second treats the case of a continuum of scales .",
    "the last part of the paper is devoted to numerical simulations , where we show in particular the decomposition on the given scales of the optimized diffeomorphism .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we first treat the case of a finite set of admissible hilbert spaces @xmath25 for @xmath26 . denoting @xmath27 ,",
    "the norm proposed in @xcite as well as in @xcite is defined by @xmath28 the following lemma is the main argument to prove the equivalence between the approaches of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this lemma is an old result that can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , we present for the sake of completeness a simple proof based on the lagrange multiplier rule . moreover , if one wants to skip the technical details of the proof , the formal application of the lagrange multiplier rule gives the result immediately .",
    "we outline the formal proof : if one has to minimize the norm defined in formula then one can introduce a lagrange multiplier @xmath29 and obtain a stationary point of the lagrangian @xmath30 which gives @xmath31 and @xmath32 hence , it gives a heuristic argument why the problem of optimizing at several scale simultaneously reduces to a mixture of the kernel .",
