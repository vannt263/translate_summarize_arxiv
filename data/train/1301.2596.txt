    "ly@xmath0 blobs ( labs ) are characterized by extended ( 20300  kpc ) ly@xmath0 nebulae that are often found in overdense regions at high redshift .",
    "the origin of ly@xmath0 nebulosity , however , is mysterious .",
    "there are possible explanations for the origin : the scenario that was first proposed is that the ly@xmath0 nebulae are produced by mechanical feedback ( or ` superwind ' ) or photo - ionisation from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and/or massive star - formation activities @xcite .",
    "in fact , ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum and/or 24-  emission , the latter arising from starburst / agn heating of dust , are often detected in labs @xcite , which can provide the sufficient number of ionising photons @xcite to account for the ly@xmath0 luminosities ( @xmath10  erg  s@xmath2 , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the large velocity width of the ly@xmath0 emission ( @xmath11550 km  s@xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can also be accounted for by the superwind scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "a sizable number of labs which lack evidence of such apparent heating sources have been reported .",
    "this fact imposes an alternative scenario in which the origin of ly@xmath0 nebulae is attributed to cooling radiation from primeval hydrogen gas which accretes on to massive dark haloes ( a.k.a .",
    "cold accretion ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there remains the possibility that the ionising sources are hidden by the interstellar medium ( ism ) located along the line of sight .",
    "observations of obscured star - formation and/or agn are therefore necessary to properly understand the origins of the ly@xmath0 nebulosity .",
    "many attempts to detect the interstellar cold dust and molecular gas in labs at millimetre ( mm ) and sub - mm wavelengths have been carried out @xcite . however , whether labs have intense star - formation activities that are capable of producing and maintaining the ly@xmath0 haloes is still controversial .    in this paper , we present the results from our unbiased 1.1-mm survey of 35 labs at @xmath1 found in optical narrow - band filter observations @xcite toward the ssa22 field , which is known for having an overdensity of ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath12 @xcite .",

    "very recently , @xcite have reported a non - detection of mm and sub - mm emission , suggesting that there is no dusty starburst associated with the lab as reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our new 1.1-mm map shows only a marginal enhancement of 1.9  mjy  beam@xmath2 ( 2.7@xmath4 ) relative to the noise .",
    "these low resolution , single - dish observations cast doubt on the presence of an extended dust component that could account for the sma non - detection .",

    "this limit is comparable to the ly@xmath0-derived sfr , but is not small enough to fully rule out the possibility that the ly@xmath0 nebulosity is produced by feedback from massive star - formation activity .",
    "@xcite claimed that their non - detection of 1.2  mm emission in a @xmath81 lab ( @xmath82  erg s@xmath2 ) , which limits the sfr to @xmath83  @xmath84  yr@xmath2 ( assuming @xmath21  k and @xmath22 ) , rules out the photoionisation scenario in favor of the cold accretion scenario .",
    "we consider , however , that the interpretation still leaves room for reconsideration , since only an sfr of 21  @xmath84  yr@xmath2 is able to produce the ly@xmath0 luminosity of the @xmath81 lab and so the sfr limit ( @xmath85  yr@xmath2 ) from the 1.2-mm measurement is not enough to exclude the photoionisation scenario .",

    "<S> we present results from the aztec / aste 1.1-mm imaging survey of 35 ly@xmath0 blobs ( labs ) found in the ssa22 protocluster at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these 1.1-mm data reach an r.m.s .  noise level of 0.71  mjy  beam@xmath2 , making this the largest millimetre - wave survey of labs to date . </S>",
    "<S> no significant ( @xmath3 ) emission is found in any of individual 35 labs , and from this , we estimate 3@xmath4 upper limits on the far - infrared luminosity of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> stacking analysis reveals that the 1.1-mm flux density averaged over the labs is @xmath6  mjy ( 3@xmath4 ) , which places a constraint of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that earlier 850-@xmath8 measurements of the labs may have overestimated their flux densities . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that labs on average have little ultra - luminous obscured star - formation , in contrast to a long - believed picture that labs undergo an intense episode of dusty star - formation activities with star - formation rates of @xmath9  yr@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> observations with alma are needed to directly study the obscured part of star - formation activity in the labs .    </S>",
