    "the large - scale structure of the universe is one of the pillars of our modern understanding of cosmology , encoding information about the contents and evolution of the universe , the physics of the growth of density fluctuations with time , and the formation and evolution of galaxies within the underlying network of dark matter haloes . in particular , the large - scale clustering pattern of galaxies is sensitive to the properties of the cosmic dark energy component which is currently poorly understood .",
    "dark energy influences both the rate of growth of structure and the geometrical distance - redshift relations .",
    "one of the cleanest probes of dark energy is to delineate as a function of redshift the apparent tangential and radial size of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale , a known `` standard ruler '' preferred separation imprinted into the galaxy distribution ( cooray et al .",

    "this cosmological probe is helping to motivate a new generation of massive spectroscopic galaxy surveys .",
    "cosmic structure has been mapped out by a succession of galaxy redshift surveys of increasing size and depth . the local universe ( redshifts @xmath16 )",
    "has been studied in exquisite detail by the 2-degree galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "the sdss luminous red galaxy component extended this programme to a mean redshift @xmath17 using a specific type of tracer galaxy ( eisenstein et al .",
    "indeed , the cosmological conclusions reached should be independent of the galaxy type used , given that the `` bias '' with which galaxies trace the underlying dark matter fluctuations is expected to be a simple linear function on large scales ( coles 1993 ; scherrer & weinberg 1998 ) . in this sense",
    ", the choice of the `` tracer population '' of galaxies can be determined by observational considerations such as telescope exposure times , the availability of input imaging data for target selection , and secondary science goals .",
    "the wigglez dark energy survey , using the aaomega multi - object spectrograph at the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , is designed as the next leap forwards in redshift coverage , targetting the range @xmath18 .",
    "the survey is scheduled to cover a sky area of 1000 deg@xmath0 , mapping a cosmic volume @xmath19 gpc@xmath8 sufficient to measure the imprint of baryon oscillations in the clustering pattern at a significantly higher redshift than has been previously achieved by 2dfgrs ( cole et al .",

    "the survey redshift range is motivated by the optimal redshift location for testing a cosmological constant model in a spatially - flat universe ( parkinson et al .",
    "2007 ) , which is the sensible initial hypothesis to reject in the dark energy parameter space .",
    "the target galaxy population is bright emission - line galaxies selected from uv imaging by the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) satellite ( martin et al .  2005 ) .",
    "this choice is motivated by the short ( 1-hr ) exposure times required to obtain redshifts at the aat .",
    "the survey commenced in august 2006 and is scheduled to finish in july 2010 , using the equivalent of 165 clear nights of telescope time ( 220 awarded nights ) .",
    "secondary science goals involve the study of star formation and galaxy evolution as a function of redshift and environment .",
    "in this initial study we focus on the small - scale clustering properties of the first @xmath2 of the wigglez sample .",
    "the clustering strength is an important parameter in the survey design and cosmological parameter forecasts : the signal - to - noise with which we can recover the galaxy power spectrum depends on the bias of the galaxies with respect to the dark matter fluctuations , which affects the balance between sample variance and shot noise in the power spectrum error budget .",
    "these initial clustering measurements allow us to determine the bias parameter and complete the survey forecast .    furthermore , the joint uv - optical selection in the redshift interval @xmath20 places the wigglez survey in an interesting location in the parameter space of galaxy evolution . in this context",
    ", the clustering strength of a set of galaxies provides a direct indication of the density of the environment or ( equivalently ) the typical mass of the dark matter haloes hosting the galaxies .",
    "the clustering strength of uv - selected samples has been studied at low redshift @xmath21 ( milliard et al .  2007 ; heinis et al .",
    "2007 ) and the corresponding rest - frame samples have been selected at much higher redshift @xmath22 through studies of the clustering of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; e.g.  giavalisco & dickinson 2001 ; ouchi et al .  2001 ; arnouts et al .  2002 ; foucaud et al .  2003 ; adelberger et al .",

    "the wigglez survey samples a redshift range which is intermediate to these previous studies .",
    "moreover , the clustering strength of optically - selected star - forming galaxies at high redshift has been studied over small areas by the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe ( deep2 ) project ( coil et al .",
    "2008 ) and the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds ; meneux et al .  2006 ) .",
    "wigglez is mapping an area @xmath23 times larger , and is therefore able to measure accurately the clustering strength of the most luminous star - forming galaxies , for which these smaller surveys are limited by small - number statistics and sample variance .",
    "the backdrop to these studies is the recent concept of `` down - sizing '' ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; glazebrook et al .  2004 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 ) whereby the stars in more massive galaxies appear to have formed earlier , and the typical mass of the most actively star - forming galaxies is expected to decrease with time .",
    "a recent study of lbgs ( yoshida et al .",
    "2008 ) has emphasized the importance of studying the clustering segregration with both uv and optical luminosities , which crudely trace ongoing star formation rate and stellar mass , respectively .",
    "wigglez is well - suited for undertaking such studies over the redshift range @xmath18 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ secdata ] we introduce the wigglez survey strategy and target selection and describe the data sample used in this study . in section [ secanalysis ]",
    "we describe the methodology used to produce the small - scale clustering measurement including the generation of random ( unclustered ) realizations of the dataset with the correct selection functions and redshift completeness map .",
    "we also explain how we derive the statistical error in the clustering measurement .",
    "we present the clustering results in section [ secresults ] ( split by redshift , absolute magnitude and rest - frame colour ) together with initial comparisons to other studies .",
    "section [ secforecast ] contains the cosmological parameter forecasts for the full wigglez survey , and section [ secconc ] summarizes our conclusions . when converting redshifts to co - moving co - ordinates we assume a spatially - flat universe with cosmological parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the design and implementation of the wigglez dark energy survey will be fully described in a forthcoming `` survey paper '' ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) which will accompany our mid - term data release .",
    "we include a brief outline here both for ease of reference and to emphasize the key points relevant to the small - scale clustering analysis .",
    "the wigglez survey strategy is to harvest low signal - to - noise spectra of a large number of uv - selected emission - line galaxies in relatively short exposure times ( 1-hr integrations at the aat ) .",
    "the survey tolerates a relatively low redshift completeness of @xmath26 but generates a large statistical sample of galaxy redshifts .",
    "the survey goal is to cover @xmath27 deg@xmath0 of the equatorial sky , gathering @xmath28 spectra of which @xmath29 are expected to yield successful redshifts .",
    "the survey was designed such that the average galaxy number density @xmath30 is related to the amplitude of the galaxy clustering power spectrum @xmath31 on the relevant baryon oscillation scales by @xmath32 , implying that the contributions of sample variance and shot noise to the clustering error are equal .",
    "this is the optimal survey strategy for fixed number of galaxies .    the wigglez survey area , illustrated in figure [ figsurvey ] , is split into seven equatorial regions to facilitate year - round observing .",
    "we require that each region should possess a minimum angular dimension of @xmath33 deg , corresponding to a spatial co - moving scale that exceeds by at least a factor of two the standard ruler preferred scale [ which projects to ( 8.5 , 4.6 , 3.2 , 2.6 ) deg at @xmath34 .",
    "the survey coverage within individual regions should also be highly ( @xmath35 ) contiguous , otherwise the significance of the detection of the acoustic features is degraded by convolution with the survey window function .",
    "the survey duration is forecast to be @xmath36 clear nights between august 2006 and july 2010 , using the multi - object capability of the 2df positioner system coupled to the aaomega spectrographs ( saunders et al .",
    "2004 ; sharp et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "galaxy redshifts are obtained from the bright emission lines associated with star - forming galaxies , in particular redshifted [ oii ] 3727 , h@xmath37 4861 and [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007 .",
    "low - resolution ( 5  fwhm ) spectra are obtained spanning the ( observed - frame ) wavelength range @xmath38 , hence the majority of successful redshifts in the range @xmath39 are confirmed by multiple emission lines .",
    "single - line redshifts are almost invariably [ oii ] , for which we usually resolve the doublet in the range @xmath40 , increasing our confidence in the line identification .",
    "redshifts are obtained by visual inspection of each spectrum using the interactive software tool `` runz '' , and are classified by a quality flag @xmath41 , where the range @xmath42 denotes a `` reliable '' redshift ( see colless et al .",
    "the fraction of stellar contamination is very small ( @xmath43 ) and we find a similarly low fraction of high - redshift quasar interlopers . the galaxy continuum is typically detected with low signal - to - noise ( an average of @xmath44 per resolution element ) .",
    "wigglez targets are chosen by a joint uv - optical selection .",
    "the primary selection dataset is the medium imaging survey undertaken by the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) uv satellite , which provides typical exposure times of 1500 seconds in two filter bands , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the galex point - spread function is too broad to allow for accurate placement of the spectrograph optical fibres , therefore the uv imaging is cross - matched with optical data . for our ngp regions ,",
    "the sdss imaging data are used . for our sgp regions ,",
    "the sdss @xmath49 stripes are too narrow compared to the preferred baryon oscillation scale hence we use imaging data from the second red cluster sequence ( rcs2 ) project instead ( yee et al .  2007 ) .",
    "sources are cross - matched between the galex and optical catalogues with a matching tolerance of 2.5 arcsec ( which produces a negligible fraction of incorrect matches ) . in each imaging dataset , the majority of galaxies possess relatively low signal - to - noise ( @xmath50 ) but their detection in both datasets ensures a robust sample .",
    "we note that acquisition of our eventual requirement of @xmath51 galex orbits of data is still ongoing . about @xmath26 of this total had been obtained at the end of 2008 .",
    "targets are chosen from the uv - optical matched sample using a series of magnitude and colour cuts .",
    "these cuts are tuned to optimize the fraction of targets lying at high redshift @xmath52 .",
    "firstly the galaxy magnitudes are de - reddened using standard dust corrections based on the local value of @xmath53 measured from the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) dust maps .",
    "the primary galex selection criterion is a red @xmath54 colour ( @xmath55 or @xmath45 drop - out ) , motivated by the lyman break passing through the @xmath45 filter for @xmath52 , and tuned by looking at galaxy templates . at the depth of the medium imaging survey",
    "this colour is noisy , resulting in a significant amount of contamination by low - redshift ( @xmath56 ) galaxies which are partially removed by the additional cuts described below .",
    "we also impose a faint uv magnitude limit @xmath57 and an additional signal - to - noise requirement @xmath58 for the detected nuv flux ( which becomes relevant for fields with unusually high dust content or low exposure time ) .",
    "the galex field - of - view is circular with radius @xmath59 deg ; we only select sources within the central @xmath60 deg because of concerns over the photometry at the edge of the field .",
    "our primary optical selection cuts are derived from sdss @xmath61-band imaging .",
    "we require a uv - optical colour in the range @xmath62 based on the expected model tracks of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we impose a bright @xmath61-band limit @xmath63 ; the uv - optical colour cut implies that the median optical magnitude of our targets is @xmath64 .",
    "finally we increase the high - redshift efficiency by introducing optical colour cuts .",
    "different cuts are used for the sdss and rcs2 regions , governed by the available imaging bands and depths .",
    "for the sdss regions analyzed in this paper , we apply cuts for those ( brighter ) galaxies with good detections in the sdss @xmath65- and @xmath66-bands .",
    "specifically , for targets with @xmath67 and @xmath68 we reject galaxies in the colour space defined by @xmath69 and @xmath70 which is occupied by low - redshift galaxies both theoretically and empirically ( more details will be given in drinkwater et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "the final fraction of @xmath71 galaxies obtained is @xmath72 .",
    "the redshift distribution is displayed in figure [ fignz ] .",
    "an average of 3 - 4 pointings of the 2df spectrograph per patch of sky is required in order to achieve the required target density of 350 deg@xmath73 . for any observing run the optimal placement of field centres ( based on the current availability of targets )",
    "is achieved using the `` metropolis '' ( simulated annealing ) algorithm ( campbell , saunders & colless 2004 ) .",
    "galaxies are prioritized for spectroscopic follow - up on the basis of optical @xmath61-band magnitude , in the sense that fainter targets are observed first .",
    "the motivation for this strategy is to combat the potential inefficiency of `` mopping up '' residual galaxies in the final pointing for any patch of sky : the brighter remaining galaxies can be observed in a shorter exposure time by configuring fewer fibres .      in this paper",
    "we analyze the subset of the wigglez sample assembled from our first observations in august 2006 up until the end of the 08a semester ( july 2008 ) . at this point",
    "we had utilized 108 of our allocated nights , of which the equivalent of 70 nights were clear .",
    "the available galaxy database included @xmath74 reliable ( @xmath75 ) wigglez unique galaxy redshifts .",
    "in this analysis we only use those galaxies lying in the sdss regions of our optical imaging because work is still on - going on the rcs2 portion of the angular selection function .",
    "specifically , we include the wigglez 9-hr , 11-hr , 15-hr and 0-hr ( sdss ) regions illustrated in figure [ figsurvey ] . the number of existing aaomega pointings in these regions is ( 42 , 98 , 140 , 48 ) . the numbers of galaxies in each region with reliable redshifts satisfying the final survey selection criteria are ( 5782 , 14873 , 21629 , 4383 ) , constituting a total sample of @xmath76 for this initial analysis ( about @xmath2 of the final sample ) .",
    "we quantify the small - scale clustering of the galaxy distribution using a standard set of techniques based on the 2-point correlation function .",
    "this statistic compares the number of observed close galaxy pairs to that expected by random chance , as a function of spatial separation .",
    "the key requirement is an ensemble of random ( unclustered ) realizations of the survey possessing the same selection function as the observed galaxy distribution . with this in place",
    "we convert the data ( d ) and random ( r ) galaxy angle - redshift distributions into a grid of co - moving co - ordinates @xmath77 using an assumed cosmological model ( we use a flat model with @xmath24 ) .",
    "we then bin the number of data - data ( dd ) , data - random ( dr ) and random - random ( rr ) pairs in the two - dimensional space of separation perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( denoted by @xmath78 ) and parallel to the line - of - sight ( denoted by @xmath79 ) .",
    "this decomposition is motivated by the influence of galaxy peculiar velocities ( redshift - space distortions ) which shift galaxies in @xmath79 , but not in @xmath78 .",
    "each of our random realizations contains the same number of targets as the data sample , and is generated by a method described below .",
    "the pair counts @xmath80 and @xmath81 are determined by averaging over 10 random realizations .",
    "the 2d redshift - space correlation function @xmath82 is derived using the estimator proposed by landy & szalay ( 1993 ) : @xmath83 ( where this last equation assumes an equal number of data and random galaxies ) .",
    "we bin galaxy pairs by the absolute value of the line - of - sight separation , i.e.  @xmath84 .",
    "the `` real - space '' correlation function ( independent of the redshift - space distortion ) can be obtained by summing equation [ eqxiest ] over @xmath79 .",
    "we first define the projected correlation function @xmath85 ( davis & peebles 1983 ) : @xmath86 where the factor of 2 extrapolates the result to the full range @xmath87 .",
    "if we assume that the real - space correlation function @xmath88 is well - described by a power - law @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the clustering length , @xmath91 is the slope and @xmath92 , and if we neglect the coherent infall velocities described below , we can then derive @xmath93 where @xmath94 the difficulty with this method is that the measurement of @xmath82 becomes noisy for large @xmath79 and therefore the summation in equation [ eqxiproj ] must be truncated at some @xmath95 , invalidating equation [ eqxireal ] .",
    "we therefore adopted the following approach ( similar to the methodology of coil et al .",
    "2008 ) to convert a model real - space correlation function @xmath89 into a projected correlation function which may be compared with the data . in the linear regime",
    ", the effect of coherent infall velocities on the correlation function can be modelled by @xmath96 where @xmath97 are the legendre polynomials , @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the angle between @xmath61 and @xmath79 .",
    "for a power - law real - space correlation function , @xmath100 \\xi_r(r)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the redshift - space distortion parameter ( hamilton 1992 ; hawkins et al .  2003 ) and @xmath102 is the linear galaxy bias parameter .",
    "we assumed @xmath103 for this model , consistent with our measurements ( see section [ secreddist ] ) , and for each set of trial values @xmath104 we employed the above set of equations to calculate @xmath82 .",
    "for each value of @xmath78 we then integrated this function in the @xmath79 direction up to @xmath105 in order to compare with the correlation function measurements .",
    "we assumed @xmath106 mpc , and we checked that our results did not depend sensitively on the value of @xmath107 .",
    "we treated each of the four survey regions independently , measuring the correlation function and corresponding error .",
    "we then constructed the `` combined '' correlation function by averaging the measurements in the four regions with inverse - variance weighting . for convenience ,",
    "we plot projected correlation functions in this paper as @xmath108 , where @xmath109      we now discuss the generation of the random survey realizations that are required for calculation of the correlation function .",
    "this determination of the survey `` selection function '' will be described fully in a forthcoming paper ( blake et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) and we give a brief summary here .",
    "the calculation begins with the angular selection function of the `` parent '' sample of uv - optical matches .",
    "this function is defined firstly by the boundaries of the galex fields and sdss coverage map . secondly , because the uv magnitudes of our sample lie close to the threshold of the galex mis observations , there is a significant incompleteness in the galex imaging that depends on the local dust extinction and galex exposure time .",
    "we used the galex number counts as a function of dust and exposure time to calibrate the relation between these quantities and the parent wigglez target density .",
    "this angular completeness function is displayed in figure [ figangsel ] for the four survey regions analyzed in this paper .",
    "we used this map to produce a series of random realizations of the parent catalogue for each region .",
    "the next step is to process these random parent catalogues into random realizations of the redshift catalogue .",
    "the spectroscopic follow - up of the parent catalogue comprises a network of overlapping aaomega pointings , with field centres optimized by the simulated annealing algorithm and not lying on a regular grid .",
    "the fraction of successful redshifts in each pointing varies considerably depending on weather conditions .",
    "furthermore , the redshift completeness within each aaomega field exhibits a significant radial variation due to acquisition errors at the plate edges .    in figure [ figredcomp ]",
    "we illustrate how the redshift completeness varies across these survey regions by simply taking the ratio of successful redshifts to parent galaxies in each pixel .",
    "this is a useful visualization , but in fact the number of unique sectors defined by the overlapping aaomega fields is so large that this determination of the redshift completeness map is very noisy .",
    "indeed , some unique sectors contain zero parent galaxies .",
    "one possible approach is to smooth this completeness map over larger areas to reduce the poisson noise at the expense of a diminished sensitivity to small - scale completeness variations between aaomega pointings . in this analysis",
    "we use an alternative approach , which is to apply the aaomega pointing sequence to each of the random realizations of the parent catalogue , and thereby create an ensemble of random realizations of the redshift catalogue .",
    "the aaomega pointing sequence is defined by the right ascension and declination of the field centre together with the number of successful and unsuccessful redshifts obtained for that pointing . within each field centre",
    "parent galaxies are chosen randomly to create the synthetic redshift catalogue .",
    "it is also necessary to track the sky coverage of the galex data which was contemporaneous with each aaomega pointing .",
    "because the acquisition of the galex imaging data is ongoing with the spectroscopic follow - up , the boundaries of the angular mask must be modulated in step with the redshift follow - up .",
    "in addition we impose the radial redshift completeness variation across each aaomega field , measured independently for each observing run .",
    "the redshift distribution @xmath110 of observed galaxies varies with position in the sky .",
    "this is due to the magnitude prioritization described in section [ sectarsel ] .",
    "because galaxies with fainter @xmath61-band magnitudes are targeted first , the @xmath110 will be skewed toward higher redshifts for areas of the survey which have been targeted by fewer aaomega observations .",
    "this dependence is accounted for in our random catalogues by measuring the magnitude distribution of targeted galaxies as a function of sky position and drawing a random redshift from the correctly weighted @xmath110 .",
    "the optical fibres of the 2df spectrograph can not be placed closer together than @xmath111 arcmin , and there is a diminishing probability of observing in a single pointing both members of a close pair of parent galaxies separated by an angular distance of less than 2 arcmin [ a projected spatial distance of @xmath112 mpc at @xmath34 .",
    "this restriction will eventually be ameliorated by the requirement of observing each patch of sky with 3 - 4 aaomega pointings to build up the number density of the redshift catalogue . at present , however , there is a deficit of close angular pairs in the redshift catalogue , which artificially suppresses the measured value of the galaxy correlation function on small scales .",
    "the close angular pair deficit is illustrated in figure [ figfibcol ] by plotting the ratio @xmath113 as a function of angular separation @xmath99 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the angular correlation functions of the targeted catalogue and the parent catalogue , respectively .",
    "this ratio provides the fraction of surviving close pairs . in order to correct the galaxy correlation function for the missing close pairs we increased the contribution of each galaxy pair to the data - data pair count as a function of angular separation by a factor @xmath116 ( the inverse of the quantity plotted in figure [ figfibcol ] ) using a 2-parameter model @xmath117\\}/2 $ ] fitted to the data in figure [ figfibcol ] .",
    "we note that for a survey with a redshift - dependent galaxy number density @xmath118 , the minimum - variance correlation function measurement for separation @xmath119 is achieved if galaxies are assigned a redshift - dependent weight @xmath120^{-1}$ ] where @xmath121 ( efstathiou 1988 ; loveday et al .",
    "1995 ) . in our case",
    "the galaxy number density is sufficiently low that @xmath122 and this weighting makes a negligible difference to the results and we do not use it .      the low signal - to - noise spectra obtained by the wigglez survey imply that a small but significant fraction of galaxies are assigned a `` reliable '' ( @xmath42 ) redshift which proves to be incorrect owing to emission - line mis - identification .",
    "this is monitored in the survey by allocating a small number of fibres ( typically 3 to 5 out of 400 per pointing ) to re - observe galaxies with existing @xmath42 redshifts .",
    "the fraction of repeat observations producing a discrepant redshift may be used to estimate the redshift `` blunder '' rate .",
    "there is a significant difference in the reliability of @xmath123 redshifts and @xmath124 redshifts .",
    "@xmath123 redshifts ( which represent a fraction @xmath125 of reliable redshifts ) are typically based either on noisy spectra or on a single emission line with no confirming spectral features , whereas @xmath124 redshifts are based on multiple detected emission lines . comparing repeat observations consisting of a @xmath123 redshift and a @xmath124 redshift , assuming that the latter provides the correct redshift identification , we conclude that @xmath126 of @xmath123 redshifts are blunders .",
    "this agrees with the internal discrepancy rate amongst repeated pairs of @xmath123 redshifts ( which is @xmath127 , which must be divided by two to obtain the blunder rate per object ) . comparing repeat observations consisting of @xmath124 redshifts",
    "we find that only @xmath128 of these redshifts are blunders .",
    "the blunder rate for @xmath123 spectra varies significantly with the true galaxy redshift , which determines how many emission lines appear in the observed wavelength range .",
    "the dependence is displayed in figure [ figzblund ] based on the comparison of @xmath123 and @xmath129 pairs of repeat observations .",
    "the total blunder rate for all reliable ( @xmath42 ) redshifts is below @xmath130 for the range @xmath131 , increasing to @xmath2 by @xmath132 .",
    "the redshift blunder rate does not depend on galaxy continuum magnitude .",
    "redshift mis - identification reduces the measured value of the galaxy correlation function because a fraction of true close data - data pairs are lost as one or both of the redshifts is randomized .",
    "if @xmath133 is the redshift blunder rate , the correction to the correlation function is a constant factor @xmath134 assuming the blunder redshift is randomly distributed .",
    "we applied this correction to the measured correlation function to deduce the final value : @xmath135    when measuring the galaxy correlation function for a particular redshift or luminosity range , we re - calculated the redshift blunder rate for the corresponding sample in each region as explained below .",
    "we corrected the correlation function for that region using equation [ eqcorrblund ] , before combining together the correlation functions for the different regions .",
    "we determined the redshift blunder rate for each region by weighting the blunder probabilities of the @xmath136 individual objects in that region : @xmath137 for objects with @xmath123 we assigned the probability for each object based on its redshift using figure [ figzblund ] . for objects with @xmath124",
    "we assumed a blunder rate of @xmath138 .      in order to determine the error in the measured correlation function we must characterize the statistical fluctuations in the data sample .",
    "it is well - known that these fluctuations are not well - described by poisson statistics , for which the error in the pair count @xmath139 in a separation bin would be equal to @xmath140 .",
    "sample variance , geometrical edge effects and the same galaxy participating in pairs in different separation bins cause the statistical variance of the galaxy pair count to exceed the poisson prediction and induce covariances between the bins .    in this analysis",
    "we use jack - knife re - sampling to determine the correlation function error . in this technique",
    "the dataset is divided into @xmath136 equal - area sub - regions on the sky .",
    "the correlation function analysis is repeated @xmath136 times , in each case omitting one of the sub - regions in turn . labelling the different correlation function measurements at separation",
    "@xmath119 as @xmath141 from @xmath142 to @xmath143 , the covariance between separation bins @xmath144 and @xmath145 was deduced as : @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "the factor @xmath148 in equation [ eqcov ] is required because the jack - knife re - samples are not independent , sharing a high fraction of common sources .    we defined the jack - knife samples by splitting each survey region into @xmath149 sub - regions using constant boundaries of right ascension and declination .",

    "<S> the wigglez dark energy survey is a large - scale structure survey of intermediate - redshift uv - selected emission - line galaxies scheduled to cover 1000 deg@xmath0 , spanning a broad redshift range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the main scientific goal of the survey is the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the galaxy clustering pattern at a significantly higher redshift than previous studies . the bao may be applied as a standard cosmological ruler to constrain dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> based on the first @xmath2 of the dataset , we present initial results concerning the small - scale clustering of the wigglez targets , together with survey forecasts . </S>",
    "<S> the wigglez galaxy population possesses a clustering length @xmath3 mpc , which is significantly larger than @xmath4 uv - selected samples , with a slope @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this clustering length is comparable to @xmath6 lyman break galaxies with similar uv luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the clustering strength of the sample increases with optical luminosity , uv luminosity and reddening rest - frame colour . </S>",
    "<S> the full survey , scheduled for completion in 2010 , will map an effective volume @xmath7 gpc@xmath8 ( evaluated at a scale @xmath9 mpc@xmath10 ) and will measure the angular - diameter distance and hubble expansion rates in three redshift bins with accuracies @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we will determine the value of a constant dark energy equation - of - state parameter , @xmath12 , with a higher precision than existing supernovae observations using an entirely independent technique . </S>",
    "<S> the wigglez and supernovae measurements lie in highly complementary directions in the plane of @xmath13 and the matter density @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the forecast using the full combination of wigglez , supernovae and cmb datasets is a marginalized error @xmath15 , providing a robust and precise measurement of the properties of dark energy including cross - checking of systematic errors .    </S>",
