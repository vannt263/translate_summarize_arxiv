    "driving a quantum three - level system with two resonant electromagnetic fields can induce destructive interference between different excitation pathways .",
    "known as the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , this important effect can be used to slow down and even stop or trap optical  @xcite and microwave photons  @xcite . also , it has potential applications in single - photon storage  @xcite and can be used to achieve a quantum transistor by combining it with cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , eit has been realized experimentally in various systems , e.g. , atomic  @xcite and molecular systems  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite and whispering - gallery - mode microresonators  @xcite . as one of the most promising systems for implementing quantum information processing , superconducting quantum circuits",
    "can also be used to demonstrate quantum - optics phenomena and effects occurring in atomic systems  @xcite .    resulting from fano interference  @xcite between two field - induced transitions",
    ", eit creates a transparency window in the measured absorption or transmission spectrum of the system .",
    "a transparency window can also be created by autler - townes splitting ( ats ) . instead of being due to the interference effect , it is caused by the electromagnetic - pumping doublet structure in the absorption or transmission spectrum  @xcite .",
    "because of the similar transparency windows in the spectrum , eit has often been confused with ats . in the field of superconducting quantum circuits ,",
    "there have been some experiments  @xcite involving either ats or eit .",
    "theoretical analyses indicated that the claimed eit was actually ats  @xcite .",
    "this is because of the difficulty for these superconducting circuits to satisfy the damping - rate conditions for realizing the eit in experiments  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it remains an unsolved , important problem to realize eit in a superconducting quantum circuit .    in this paper , we report an experimental observation of the eit in a circuit quantum electrodynamics system consisting of a transmon qubit and a three - dimensional ( 3d ) waveguide cavity .",
    "the key point is to engineer a tunable effective environment for the transmon states by utilizing the effect of the cavity , which is impossible when using an open system such as an open coplanar waveguide  @xcite . by varying the magnetic flux in the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) loop to tune the transition frequency between the ground state and the second excited state of the transmon , we can adjust the damping rates between transmon states to reach the eit regime of the system . indeed ,",
    "both our experimental results and the akaike information criterion ( aic )  @xcite analysis of the measured cavity transmission spectrum explicitly reveal that the 3d transmon system has reached the eit regime in certain situations .",
    "the device used is a tunable 3d transmon , where the single josephson junction in a conventional 3d transmon  @xcite is replaced by a squid with two identical josephson junctions .",
    "this symmetric squid is fabricated on a silicon substrate using the standard double - angle evaporation process ; the al / alox / al junction has an area of @xmath2  nm@xmath3  nm , the squid loop is of the size @xmath4m@xmath5 m , and each shunting capacitor al pad has an area of @xmath6m@xmath7 m .",
    "these two al pads and the cavity constitute a large capacitance shunted to the squid . the charging energy of this transmon",
    "is measured to be @xmath8  mhz , which includes the effect of the shunt capacitance .",
    "the squid behaves as an effective josephson junction tuned by the externally applied magnetic field . at the bias magnetic field where the eit occurs",
    ", the coupling energy of the effective josephson junction is measured to be @xmath9  ghz .",
    "the 3d cavity has dimensions @xmath10  mm@xmath11  mm@xmath12  mm , with a fundamental eigenmode te@xmath13 of @xmath14  ghz and a loaded quality factor @xmath15 . the coupling strength between the first excited state of the transmon and the cavity mode is @xmath16  mhz , as obtained here via the vacuum rabi splitting measurement .",
    "the experiment was performed in a bluefors ld-400 dilution refrigerator at @xmath17  mk [ see fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) ] .",
    "we use @xmath18 , @xmath19 , to denote the lowest three eigenstates of the transmon with the corresponding energies @xmath20 [ see fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) ] , where the transition frequency between states @xmath18 and @xmath21 is @xmath22 ( @xmath23 )",
    ". the cavity acts as an effective environment for the transmon states and this effective environment can be engineered to be tunable by varying the detuning of the transition frequency @xmath24 from the cavity frequency via the magnetic field in the squid loop .",
    "notably , our experimental results show that when decreasing this frequency detuning , the damping rate @xmath25 between @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be greatly increased .",
    "this is due to the enhanced dissipation from the cavity as the transition frequency @xmath24 becomes close to the cavity frequency . here",
    "the cavity is used to engineer the noise spectrum of the transmon , where the noise around the cavity frequency can be stronger . moreover , as can be seen from the appendix , the dominating noise channel for @xmath25 is due to the flux noise through the squid loop . because the transmon is detuned from the flux sweet spot in the present case , its sensitivity to the flux noise is also increased . to determine the damping rate @xmath28 ( @xmath25 ) between @xmath29 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 , various spectroscopy tones with different strengths",
    "have been applied to measure the spectroscopy of the transmon .",
    "while the spectroscopy tone is weak enough ( for this experiment , the spectroscopy tone strength is estimated to be @xmath30  mhz ) , the nearly intrinsic linewidth can be obtained . by fitting each peak in the measured transmission spectrum of the cavity via a lorentzian , we obtain the damping rates @xmath31  mhz and @xmath32  mhz . also , the transition frequencies are measured to be @xmath33  ghz , @xmath34  ghz , and @xmath35  ghz .",
    "the detuning of @xmath36 from the cavity frequency is 153.85  mhz .    in the experiment for eit and ats",
    ", we applied a control field in resonance with the transition frequency between @xmath26 and @xmath29 ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) and a probe field slightly detuned with the transition frequency between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) [ see fig .  [ figure1](b ) ] .",
    "the corresponding driving strengths of these two microwave tones on the three - level system are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "while these probe and control tones interact with the three - level system , they can not transmit through the cavity due to the off - resonance with the cavity .",
    "also , because the cavity mode is only dispersively coupled to the three - level system , the quantum dynamics of this three - level system becomes effectively decoupled from the cavity mode in this dispersive regime .",
    "as depicted in fig .  [ figure1](b ) , under the rotating - wave approximation , the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath41 , with ( we set @xmath42 ) @xmath43 where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity mode , @xmath46 is the dispersive frequency of the cavity when the transmon is in the ground state , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the level difference between the state @xmath29 ( @xmath26 ) and the state @xmath27 , and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the coupling strength between the cavity mode and the transition @xmath51 ( @xmath26 ) . here",
