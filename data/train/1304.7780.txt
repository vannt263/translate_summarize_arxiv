    "we know of @xmath220 x - ray binaries with dynamically confirmed black hole ( bh ) accretors ; these include 15 low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and 3 high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) in the milky way and magellanic clouds ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references within ) , as well as bh + wolf - rayet binaries in ic10 @xcite and ngc300 @xcite .",
    "these systems were identified using x - ray and optical observations ; the mass function is calculated from periodic radial velocity shifts in emission lines from the optical counterpart .",
    "all of the bh lmxbs identified this way are necessarily transient , because the optical spectra of bright lmxbs are dominated by the accretion disc ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have established a method for identifying bhcs from their x - ray properties alone .",
    "this makes use of the `` low / hard '' emission state seen in bh and neutron star ( ns ) xbs @xcite , that is only seen at 0.011000 kev luminosities @xmath010% eddington in ns xbs @xcite ; @xcite recently found that the low / hard state is limited to luminosities @xmath010% eddington in bh xbs also .",
    "bh xbs may exhibit low / hard emission states at considerably higher luminosities than ns xbs , due to the higher accretor mass .",
    "however , it is necessary to differentiate between our bhcs and distant active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , since agn and xb emission spectra are often similar .",
    "we have identified 10 bhcs from their high luminosity low states to date . of these ,",
    "9 are associated with m31 gcs @xcite , and are therefore likely lmxbs .",
    "only one of these is transient ; however , persistently bright gc bh xbs are consistent with tidal capture of a main sequence donor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* although the donor may be disrupted in the process ) , or with an ultra - compact system with a degenerate donor @xcite .",
    "we identified our first bhc outside of a gc from its x - ray spectra , long term ( @xmath212 year ) behaviour , and a serendipitous hst observation @xcite ; the faint optical counterpart ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath70.4 ) suggests a low mass donor for this system also .",
    "we cover 8 of the 9 gc bhcs in our survey : bhcs 1 , 2 , 20 , 25 , 28 , 31 , 32 , and 34 .",

    "the x - ray spectra of bh binaries are usually described with two components : a thermal component ( often modelled as a multi - temperature disk blackbody ) , and a power law component to represent unsaturated , inverse - compton scattering of cool photons on hot electrons @xcite .",

    ".      high accretion rate ns xbs exhibit multi - component emission that may appear to be hard state spectra in extragalactic x - ray sources , where the spectra have relatively few photons . to compare the emission spectra of our bhcs with ns xrb , we use the double thermal ( disk blackbody + blackbody ) model used by lin et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 , 2012 ) to describe hundreds of rxte observations of ns xbs in all their varied emission states .",
    "we note that the physical interpretation of their model is contradicted for persistent xbs by a substantial body of work ; however , lin et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 , 2012 ) have sampled spectra from the full range of ns lmxb emission states in a consistent manner , allowing us to compare our bhcs with ns xbs in a single parameter space .    for a long time",
    ", ns xbs were divided into two types , z - sources ( high lumonisity ) and atoll sources ( low luminosity ) , based on their luminosities and color - color diagrams ( cds ) ; the cds of z - sources had three branches ( horizontal , normal , and flaring ) , and evolved along these branches without ever jumping from one branch to the other ; the cds of the atoll sources were more fragmented @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the z - sources were split into those like cygnus x-2 , and those like scorpius x-1 @xcite .",
    "it was believed that the differences were due to more than just the accretion rate , because the z - sources varied by a factor of a few when tracing their z - shaped cds , while atoll source intensities varied by 12 orders of magnitude @xcite . however , we now know of two transient ns systems that exhibited both types of z - source behavior before evolving to atoll source behavior during decay @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the spectral evolution of two galactic x - ray transients , aql x-1 and 4u1608@xmath752 , over many rxte observations covering @xmath620 outbursts .",
    "they devised a new double - thermal model ( disk blackbody + blackbody ) to describe a ns transient soft state that is analagous to the bh soft state described by @xcite .",
    "they have since applied their model to rxte observations of xtej1701@xmath7462 , one of the transients that exhibits cyg - like and sco - like z - source behavior as well as atoll behavior @xcite , and also to the sco - like z - source gc 17 + 2 @xcite .",
    "they have applied their model to hundreds of rxte spectra from galactic ns binaries including the full gamut of ns spectral behavior .",
    "they found that their disk blackbody + blackbody was unsuccessful in two situations .",
    "firstly , they found the hard state spectra to be power law dominated , as expected @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect our bhcs to inhabit a separate parameter space to the ns xbs because fitting the double thermal model to hard state spectra will yield unphysical results .",
    "secondly , they found that z - sources required a three - component spectrum ( disk blackbody + blackbody + power law ) on the horizontal branch @xcite .",
    "@xcite also performed broadband analysis of suzaku and bepposax observations of the persistently bright galactic ns xb 4u1705@xmath744 , with energy ranges 0.1600 kev and 0.1300 kev respectively .",
    "when using a disk blackbody + blackbody model to the soft state spectra , they found temperatures that were similar to those they observed in the rxte observations @xcite . fitting an additional comptonization component , via either a power law or simpl convolution model ( following * ? ? ? * ) resulted only in small changes in the thermal components ; this is because the comptonized component only contributed @xmath010% of the total flux in the soft state ( see fig .",
    "6 in * ? ? ?",
    "hence the parametric differences between our bhcs and the ns xbs should not be due to differences in energy bands used in the observations , or the lack of a third ( power law ) component .",
    "evidence against the double thermal model indicates an extended corona that contributes a substantial portion of the x - ray flux .",
    "this evidence includes the ingress times of periodic absorption dips in the x - ray lightcurves of the high inclination xbs ( the dipping sources , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) , and also broadened emission lines in a chandra grating spectroscopy of cyg x-2 @xcite . furthermore , compact corona models where the inner disk temperature is tied to the seed photon energy for comptonization are rejected for ulxs in ngc253 , and the confirmed bh+wolf - rayet binary ic10 x-1 @xcite , as well as bhc3 in the steep power law state @xcite .      in @xcite , we applied structure function analysis to xbs for the first time , following @xcite , who created an ensemble structure function for agn .",
    "they used a structure function ( sf ) to estimate the mean intensity deviation for data separated by time @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the photon noise and @xmath27 is the x - ray flux .",
    "they grouped the sf into logarithmic bins with width 0.5 ; each bin in the range log(@xmath24 ) = 0.03.0 contained more than 100 measurements .",
    "our sample consisted of 37 x - ray sources associated with objects in the rbc ; these were classified by @xcite as 30 confirmed gcs , 4 gc candidates , 1 star , and 2 agn .",
    "the sfs of gc xbs with 0.310 kev luminosities @xmath2250@xmath28 erg s@xmath17 tended to show significantly more variability than agn over a wide range of time - scales .",
    "the sfs of brighter xbs generally showed comparable or less variability than agn , despite their high signal to noise ; however , their high fluxes made them unlikely agn .",
    "sfs provide an effective mechanism for distinguishing between xbs and agn @xcite .      in this work ,",
    "we combine these techniques to search for bhcs in the whole region covered by 152 chandra observations from our monitoring programme ; the roll angle is unrestricted , resulting an approximately circular field of view with radius @xmath29 .",
    "we surveyed 530 x - ray sources in this region .",
    "we also obtain spectra from archival xmm - newton observations , to strengthen the cases for several bhcs .",
    "the 100@xmath3 region surrounding m31 * is particularly interesting , because @xcite found an excess of x - ray binaries over the radial distribution expected from k band light ( tracing stellar mass ) ; this excess had the distribution expected of dynamically formed xbs @xcite .",
    "dynamical xb formation requires stellar densities rarely seen outside gcs , and @xcite proposed that the m31 bulge is sufficiently large and dense to form a significant number of xbs dynamically . however , since the stellar velocities in the m31 bulge are @xmath2510 times higher than in gcs , @xcite expect only short period binaries to survive , with most of these containing bh accretors .",
    "evidence for bhcs in this region would therefore provide strong support for their theory .    in the next section , we discuss the observations and data analysis ; this is followed by our results , then by our discussion .",
    "the central region of m31 has been observed with chandra on a @xmath2 monthly basis for the last @xmath213 years in order to monitor transients ; we exclude periods when m31 can not be observed due to satellite constraints ( @xmath2 march  april ) .",
    "we have analyzed 98 acis observations and 54 hrc observations .",
    "we determined the position of each source from a merged 0.37.0 kev acis image , using the iraf tool imcentroid .",
    "the x - ray positions were registered to the field 5 b band image of m31 from the local group galaxy survey ( lgs , see * ? ? ? * ) , using 27 gc x - ray sources and following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the r.m.s uncertainties in registration were 0.11@xmath8 in r.a . and 0.09@xmath8 in dec .",
    "we obtained 0.37.0 kev lightcurves and spectra from circular source and background regions for each source .",
    "the background region was the same size as the source region , and at a similar off - axis angle .",
    "the extraction radius varied between sources , because larger off - axis angles resulted in larger point spread functions .",
    "we used the ciao v4.5 software suite , with corresponding caldb to reduce the data , and xspec v12.7 to analyze the spectra .    for acis observations , we obtained corresponding response matrices and ancillary response files .",
    "we initially estimated the conversion from flux to luminosity by assuming a power law emission spectrum with photon index 1.7 , with @xmath11 = 7@xmath30 atom cm@xmath17 , then determining the unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosity equivalent to 1 count s@xmath17 at the location of the source .",
    "after correcting for the exposure , vignetting and background , multiplying the source intensity by this conversion factor gave the source luminosity .",
    "source spectra with @xmath6200 net counts were freely fitted .",
    "when good spectral fits were found for a particular observation of a source , the parameters of these fits replaced the default parameters when estimating the source luminosity for observations of the source with @xmath20200 photons .",
