    "<S> the fact that the blockade radius , and , thus , the interaction strength , is sensitive to frequency is a typical feature of nonlinear optical systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also stress that @xmath92 is identical to the figure of merit in the far - detuned regime @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the optical depth per blockade radius . </S>",
    "<S> the figure of merit quantifies the strength of the interaction as two polaritons imprint a phase @xmath95 on each other @xcite .     with the dispersion in hand </S>",
    "<S> , we now explore the stability of the coulomb states . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq . wavefunction ] ) are a complete set of eigenstates for the two - particle hilbert space . to normalize these states , we take @xmath44 to be fixed and use the energy normalization @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then verify the metastability of the coulomb states ( @xmath97=0 $ ] ) with the delta - function removed by looking at their decomposition into the normalized eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2(b ) shows this decomposition for several @xmath98 , where we see that the coulomb states are sharply peaked at the expected frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the width of these distributions can be much narrower than the spacing between states , a strong signature of spectral distinguishability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the coulomb states converge to the exact eigenstates for a very strong interaction strength , which is analogous to the leaky box in the limit of an infinitely deep potential @xcite .    a unique feature of the dispersion curves in fig .  [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> dispersion relation](a ) is that their slope , and thus the group velocity , is negative . </S>",
    "<S> while true eigenstates can not have a negative group velocity in the absence of left - moving modes ( supplemental material @xcite ) , coulomb states are not exact eigenstates and eventually decay into rydberg molecules . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq . apprx to quantz condition ] ) gives the group velocity as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the eit group velocity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the velocity is also quantized as @xmath87 for different branches of bound states ( and fixed values of @xmath43 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this quantization and the negative sign make the group velocity an ideal signature for detecting different coulomb states . </S>",
    "<S> we also remark that a small @xmath24 ( @xmath101 ) modifies the energy only slightly , proportional to @xmath102 , which thus becomes negligible for large detuning .     </S>",
    "<S> we now show how to prepare these states and measure their dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that we have access to an additional hyperfine ground state @xmath103 , which , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) , is connected to both @xmath104 and the rydberg state @xmath34 through two - photon transitions via an excited state @xmath105 . with these additional states </S>",
    "<S> , we can effectively turn on and off the polariton interactions by applying a fast @xmath106-pulse on the two - photon transition between @xmath103 and @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the preparation procedure is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we store two identical photons ( equivalently a weak coherent state followed by postselection ) in the atomic state @xmath103 using standard protocols @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to have a significant overlap with the coulomb states once we map to @xmath34 , the state has to have the correct center of mass momentum @xmath44 . to achieve this , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a linear energy gradient @xmath107 along the atomic cloud for a time @xmath108 , which could be achieved with a magnetic field gradient , another optical beam , or microwave field . </S>",
    "<S> this will impart a phase @xmath109 on the stored two - photon state . by choosing the appropriate @xmath108 and then mapping @xmath103 to @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , we can selectively excite different coulomb states provided they have a large enough spatial overlap with the initial product state input . </S>",
    "<S> as the bound states travel with negative group velocity , the coulomb state component will separate from the rest of the wavefunction . to detect the state </S>",
    "<S> , one can then map the rydberg state back to @xmath103 and either measure the population of the state @xmath103 directly or retrieve the state into light . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b - d ) , for realistic parameters ( including @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) @xcite , we verify this approach by preparing a variational state that has a large overlap with the @xmath46 component of the coulomb state [ shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) ] with other components equal to zero and solve numerically for the time evolution @xcite . in this case , the effective energy @xmath66 of the bound state lies above @xmath18 and the wavefunction is peaked at @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also verified that , when @xmath110 , the backward propagating state becomes double peaked and that , for smaller decay rates and larger @xmath111 , the negative group velocity observed in the numerics agrees with the wkb prediction from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq . quantization condition ] ) for the @xmath112 , 2 and 3 coulomb states within a few percent in each case @xcite .    before concluding , we point out several conditions necessary for the experimental observation of coulomb states . </S>",
    "<S> first , the delta functions appearing in the underlying exact eigenstates should be consistent with the treatment of atoms as a continuous medium . </S>",
    "<S> this requires @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the atomic density , @xmath115 is the beam waist , and @xmath116 is the effective width of the delta function due to the uncertainty in @xmath43 coming from the finite duration of an experiment @xmath108 , which is in turn limited by the lifetime of the coulomb states [ @xmath117 from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> dispersion relation]b ] . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments achieved a density of @xmath118 @xmath119 with a beam waist of @xmath120 @xmath121 m , corresponding to @xmath122  ghz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will use below the parameters of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , where @xmath123  ghz , so we will take @xmath120 @xmath121 m and @xmath124 @xmath119 . taking @xmath125 , </S>",
    "<S> we then find @xmath126 @xmath121 m and @xmath127 . </S>",
    "<S> second , two atoms initially @xmath13 away from each other should not change their distance by more than @xmath128 if they are displaced transversely by @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the condition @xmath129 , which is nearly satisfied , and can be more strictly satisfied by changing the center frequency of the wavepacket to increase @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the force on a pair of rydberg atoms @xmath13 apart and their thermal velocity must both induce motion less than @xmath128 over time @xmath108 , leading to the conditions @xmath130 . using the mass @xmath56 of @xmath131rb and temperature @xmath132 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath121k @xcite , the first condition is satisfied ( @xmath133 @xmath121 m @xmath134 0.2 @xmath121 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second condition can be satisfied by using a sufficiently high control field intensity .    _ </S>",
    "<S> outlook._while our proposal opens the avenue for the creation of coulomb - like two - photon states , we expect that a wide class of both useful and exotic two - photon and multi - photon states can be created via refined engineering of photon - photon interactions , e.g.  by using microwave fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed understanding of the two - photon rydberg - eit physics provided by this work also opens up an avenue towards understanding the full  and much richer  many - body problem involving an arbitrary number of photons in any dimension .    </S>",
