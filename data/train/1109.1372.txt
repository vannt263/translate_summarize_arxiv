    "those lirgs with small agn contributions ( @xmath30 } < 0.1 $ ] ) tend to have values of the line ratio and the ew consistent with those observed in nuclear and extra - nuclear star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "only one lirg is in the region of unobscured agns ( seyfert 1s and quasars ) or class 1a , which typically tend to show low values of the ew of the pah features @xcite .",

    "* for more details ) .    the spoon et al .",
    "diagnostic diagram for lirgs only provides a relatively good separation between agn - dominated lirgs , lirgs with intermediate agn contributions and lirgs with very little or no agn contribution .",
    "only one of the galaxies dominated by the agn emission ( @xmath30 } > 0.5 $ ] ) appears in the 1a class , whereas the other two are in the composite region and in the 2a class .",
    "most of those with intermediate agn contributions ( @xmath30 } = 0.1 - 0.5 $ ] ) are in the composite region , as expected .",
    "however , two of them appear in region 1c , which is that occupied by pah - dominated galaxies . those with little ( @xmath30 } = 0.1 - 0.04 $ ] ) or no agn contribution are mostly either in the 1c region ( starburst region ) , or near the border between class 2b and class 2c , and therefore are not easily identified as having an agn from this diagram .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the @xcite clumpy torus models never produce a very deep silicate feature ( i.e. , the models have @xmath42 ) .",
    "this means that for deeply embedded galaxies the agn templates used here ( see discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may not be appropriate and an agn component might be missed .",
    "for instance two galaxies with relatively deep silicate features , ic  694 and mcg+02 - 20 - 003 , are classified as liner and composite , respectively , but an agn component has not been detected through our spectral decomposition fit .",
    "however , it is important to note here that deeply embedded sources are rare among local lirgs .",
    "in this section we summarize the results of sections  4 and 5 in terms of the agn detection rate in our complete volume - limited sample of local lirgs and investigate any possible dependence with the ir luminosity .",
    "we also compare the agn detection rate in lirgs with other types of galaxies .    out of the 50 galaxies with irs spectroscopy we detected an agn component in 25 using the agn+sb spectral decomposition ( see table  2 , and figures  1 and a1 ) .",
    "an additional eight galaxies are classified spectroscopically as composite or liner . of these , one did not have irs spectroscopy ( the irs spectrum of ngc  1614 was not well centered ) and for the remaining seven the agn was not detected based on our spectral decomposition ( ugc  1845 , mcg  + 02 - 20 - 003 , iras  17138@xmath431017 , ic  694 , ngc  5734 , ngc  7591 , zw049.057 ) .",
    "this brings the combined optical+ir agn detection rate in the individual nuclei of our sample of lirgs to @xmath3 . in terms of the 45 _ iras _ systems ,",
    "an agn is found in 32 , that is , @xmath44 .",
    "this agn detection rate is in good agreement with that derived from optical emission lines @xcite and x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "figure  7 shows the number of agn detections for the individual nuclei of our sample of lirgs in three ir luminosity bins .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the agn detection rate stays approximately constant at a @xmath45 rate for the three luminosity bins @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xcite have conducted a study similar to ours using the goals sample of 248 lirgs .",
    "they identified agn through detections in 18% of their sample , virtually identical to the 22% detection rate for us .",
    "they also detected in 53% of their galaxies , whereas we detected it in 70% ( see section  5.3 ) .",
    "they do not count the [ oiv ] detections as agn , whereas we find that many of these galaxies do indeed harbor active nuclei ( from the spectral decomposition and/or optical class , see section  5.3 ) .",
    "@xcite also used the ew of the @xmath33 m aromatic feature and the 5 to @xmath49 m continuum flux ratios as agn indicators , and concluded that @xmath50 of their sample are dominated by agn in the mid - ir .",
    "we find that @xmath51 ( table  4 ) of our sample have a mid - ir agn contribution greater than 50% of the total luminosity at 24 .",
    "the difference may arise from slightly different methodologies , but both studies agree that the agn plays a substantial role in the mid - ir energetics only in a relatively small minority of these galaxies .",
    "however , we also find that 50% of the galaxies in our sample contain agns , based on our mid - ir spectral decomposition method , and @xmath52 60% if we combine optical and mid - ir indicators .",
    "our ability to find many more agns than @xcite did in the larger but similar sample suggests that our spectral decomposition method is a powerful way to identify subtle agn features . as a result , we can show that agns accompany star formation activity in a large proportion of local lirgs , although in most cases the agns are not energetically important .    the agn detection rate in local lirgs is very similar to that of local ulirgs .",
    "the latter is found to be 70% on average using mid - ir diagnostics @xcite . in lower luminosity galaxies agns",
    "are detected in much smaller fractions .",
    "for instance , in the optically - selected rsa sample @xcite found a @xmath53 agn incidence , based on optical indicators .",
    "the agn fraction in nearby ( @xmath54mpc ) moderately ir luminous galaxies ( @xmath55 ) is slightly higher , 27% , when including detections , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "although the combined optical+ir agn detection rate in local lirgs is relatively high , @xmath3 , and only slightly less than in local ulirgs , the important quantity is the agn bolometric contribution to the ir luminosity of the galaxies . using the agn bolometric luminosities derived from the spectral decomposition ( section  5.2 )",
    ", we can derive the agn bolometric contribution to the total ir luminosity of local lirgs ( both with and without agn detections ) .",
    "we find that agns contribute @xmath56% of the ir luminosity . ] .",
    "the upper and lower limits take into account the uncertainties in the derived agn bolometric luminosities . for the 9 galaxies with an agn optical classification but no agn emission detected from the agn+sb decomposition",
    ", we assumed the typical agn bolometric luminosity of the composite sources ( see section  5.2 ) .",
    "this estimate proves that the bulk of the ir luminosity of local lirgs is due to star formation activity .",
    "our estimate of the agn contribution to the total ir luminosity of lirgs is in excellent agreement with that estimated from the x - ray properties of the representative sample studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that agn supply @xmath57 of the total energy emitted by the goals lirgs , which is compatible with our upper limit of the agn contribution .",
    "taking the newly determined ir luminosity density produced by lirgs in the local universe of @xmath58 @xcite , we estimate that the agn ir luminosity density in the lirg luminosity range is @xmath59 .",
    "our estimate of the agn ir luminosity density is about seven times lower than that of @xcite , probably because these authors assumed that in those lirgs classified as active galaxies and especially those classified as composite the ir luminosity is entirely due to the agn .",
    "finally , we can also compare @xmath60}$ ] and @xmath30}$ ] with the agn bolometric contribution to the ir luminosity of the galaxies ( figure  8) .",
    "the relation between the agn contribution in the mid - ir and the agn bolometric contribution is slightly better at 24 than at 6 .",
    "as explained above , the irac 5.8 images of some lirgs may include a sizable contribution from the 6.2 pah feature , and/or the 6 emission of type 2 agns might not be fully isotropic .",
    "it can also be seen from figure  8 that , although @xmath30}$ ] and @xmath5/l_{\\rm ir}$ ] do not follow a 1:1 relation , the relation is nearly linear . on average @xmath30 } = ( 2.9 \\pm 1.6 ) \\times l_{\\rm bol}[{\\rm    agn}]/l_{\\rm ir}$ ] . we conclude that estimating the agn fraction at 24 is a good proxy for the bolometric agn contribution in lirgs . moreover , because the fractional agn contribution is on average higher in the mid - ir than bolometrically , the mid - ir spectral range is very appropriate to study the fractional agn / sb contribution .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion for a sample of ir luminous galaxies at @xmath61 .",
    "we summarize the agn bolometric contribution for our sample of local lirgs ( with and without agn detections ) in figure  9 .",
    "we also compare in this figure our estimates for local lirgs with those for local ulirgs of @xcite .",
    "this comparison is meaningful because both our work and that of nardini et al .",
    "quantify the agn bolometric luminosities . in this figure we separated the agn bolometric contributions @xmath63/l_{\\rm ir}$ ] in three ranges : @xmath64 . in approximately one - third of local lirgs",
    "the agn bolometric contribution is mild , @xmath5/l_{\\rm ir}\\ge 0.05 $ ] .",

    "however , it is only at @xmath67 that the agns start dominating bolometrically the ir luminosity in a large fraction of local ulirgs ; 40% of ulirgs in the high luminosity bin in figure  9 have @xmath5/l_{\\rm ir}>0.60 $ ] ( see figure  9 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in summary , in the local universe",
    "there is an increasing bolometric contribution from agns at higher ir luminosities , going from 5% in lirgs to an average of 27% in ulirgs @xcite and @xmath68 for the 1jy ulirg sample @xcite .",
    "while the trend for an increased agn bolometric dominance at high ir luminosities is well established locally , at high-@xmath62 it is still a matter of debate .",
    "for instance , @xcite needed to introduce an evolution in the agn contribution to model the submillimeter to mid - ir number counts and redshift distribution of high-@xmath62 ir galaxies .",
    "in particular they found that at a given ir luminosity high-@xmath62 ir galaxies needed a smaller agn contribution than locally .",
    "this is in line with results of @xcite using deep mid - ir spectroscopy of @xmath69 lirgs and @xmath70 ulirgs . in both populations",
    "the fraction of agn dominated sources is small , being @xmath57 in ulirgs and @xmath71 in lirgs . also @xcite found no significant change in the overall star formation contribution to @xmath29 from lirgs to ulirgs at @xmath61 .",
    "however , other works found evidence for higher agn contributions for the most ir luminous galaxies at high-@xmath62 .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that , although submillimeter galaxies are dominated by intense star formation , the average agn bolometric contribution could be as high 30% .",
    "moreover , @xcite found a strict upper limit of @xmath72 for the ir luminosity to be due to star formation in galaxies at all redshifts . above that limit , agn",
    "are expected to provide the power .",
    "we have decomposed the _ spitzer_/irs @xmath73 spectra of a complete volume - limited ( @xmath74mpc ) sample of local lirgs into agn and sb components .",
    "the main goal of this work is to quantify the agn contribution to the mid - ir and ir emission of these systems . for the sb component we used starburst and lirg templates , whereas the agn component was fitted with the @xcite clumpy torus models .",
    "we have also compared our mid - ir agn detections with this method with other agn indicators , including mid - ir spectral features , optical classification and x - ray properties .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows ,    1 .   using the agn+sb spectral decomposition we detected an agn component in 25 out of the 50 individual lirg nuclei with irs spectroscopy . for an additional nine galaxies optically classified as composite ( agn / sb ) we did not detect an agn with our method .",
    "the combined optical and mid - ir agn detection rate is @xmath3 ( 33/53 ) for the individual nuclei of local lirgs .",

    "our results prove that the bulk of the ir luminosity of local lirgs is due to star formation activity .    in summary , mid - ir spectral decomposition is a powerful tool to estimate the agn contribution to both the mid - ir emission and the total emission of ir - selected sources .",
    "this is because not only are we able to identify all seyfert - like agn in local lirgs but also because this technique is powerful enough to identify subtle agn features ( i.e. , low luminosity agn ) that might be missed by other mid - ir methods . as a result",

    "the inner radius of the torus in these models is set by the dust sublimation temperature , which is assumed to be @xmath89 k. ( 2 ) the angular distribution of the clouds , which is assumed to have a smooth boundary , is described as a gaussian with a width parameter @xmath90 .",
    "( 3 ) the radial distribution of the clouds , which is described as a declining power law with index @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) . ( 4 ) the mean number of clouds along a radial equatorial ray @xmath93 . ( 5 ) the optical depth of the clouds @xmath94 . ( 6 ) the viewing angle to the torus , @xmath95 . in the models",
    "the radiative transfer equations are solved for each clump and thus the solutions depend mainly on the location of each clump within the torus , its optical depth , and the chosen dust composition . for the fits done in this work we adopted a dust extinction profile corresponding to a standard cold oxygen - rich ism dust @xcite .",
    "the total torus emission is calculated by integrating the source function of the total number of clumps convolved with the radiation propagation probability along the torus @xcite . for unobscured views of the agn ,",
    "it is also possible to include its contribution to the resulting ir emission .",
    "the agn continuum emission in these models is characterized with a piecewise power law distribution ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "in addition to the the six torus model parameters , there is an extra parameter to account for the vertical displacement needed to match the fluxes of a given model to the observations .",
    "this vertical shift , which we allow to vary freely , scales with the agn bolometric luminosity ( see * ? ? ? * ) .    given the large number of _ clumpy _ models ( currently more than @xmath96 ) and the inherent degeneracy in the torus model parameters , @xcite took a bayesian approach to fit models to the data and to derive meaningful confidence levels for the fitted parameters .",
    "to this end , they developed a tool called bayesclumpy that allows fitting both photometric points and/or mid - ir spectra .",
    "for the bayesian inference of bayesclumpy we used an interpolated version of the _ clumpy _ dusty torus models .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details on the interpolation methods and algorithms used by bayesclumpy to perform the torus model fits to the data .",
    "we used an iterative method to perform the agn+sb decomposition . in the first step we started by using only two agn templates",
    "given the large number of _ clumpy _ torus models and their degeneracy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed discussions on this issue ) .",
    "we used the best fit _",
    "clumpy _ torus model of the average spectral energy distributions of seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s inferred by @xcite .",
    "we obtained the best fit to the irs spectra for each lirg in our sample with this initial combination of agn+sb templates .",
    "we next subtracted the sb component from the original irs spectrum to obtain the agn - only mid - ir spectrum . this agn - only spectrum",
    "was then fitted with the bayesclumpy routine @xcite to infer the best fit torus model and the corresponding scaling for each galaxy .",
    "we finally refitted the observed irs spectrum of the lirg using its corresponding best - fit torus model , allowing for rescaling , and the appropriate sb template that minimized @xmath97 .",
    "the fits were done in the @xmath98 m spectral range to avoid the edges of the spectra and the slightly decreased signal - to - noise ratio of some of the spectra observed in mapping mode at @xmath99 .",
    "we note , however , that the fits tend to be good also at @xmath100 .",
    "we considered an agn detection when its contribution was greater than 5 - 7% at 20 .",
    "below this limit we were not able to fit the agn - only spectra with bayesclumpy .",
    "this is because after subtracting the sb template in these cases a large proportion of the data points were close to zero or even negative . for each fit the formal errors of the agn fractional contribution within the irs slit",
    "were calculated using the observational errors of the irs spectra and the covariance matrix .",
    "the typical errors of the agn fractional contribution within the irs slit at @xmath101 m are @xmath102 .",
    "if the models fit the data , as is the case for most galaxies , these can be taken as the typical uncertainties of the agn fractional contributions .",
    "this is because the variation of the fitted parameters is compatible with the data observational errors .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the use of different sb templates are discussed briefly in section  4.1 .",
    "we present the best agn+sb fits for all the lirgs in our sample in figures  1 , a1 , and a2 . as can be seen from figure  a2 a few lirgs deemed not to have a mid - ir agn detection have best fit requiring a small agn contribution .",
    "these are ngc  5734 , which is optically classified as composite , and eso  221@xmath43g010 and ic  4734 , which are classified as hii ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the agn fraction at @xmath103 for all of them was , however , below the imposed limit .",
    "in these cases we were not able to fit the agn - only emission with the torus models , and the agn template corresponds to the seyfert 2 template used in the first step of the iteration .",
