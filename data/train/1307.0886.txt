    "photosynthetic bacteria are among the simplest organisms on earth which use sunlight as their main energy source  @xcite . to collect solar energy these bacteria exploit light - harvesting complexes ( lhc ) , aggregates of pigment molecules , which absorb photons and transfer the associated energy at the submicron scale .",
    "the lhc in green sulfur bacteria contains large light absorbing antennae self - assembled in the so - called chlorosome  @xcite .",
    "these bacteria are obligate phototrophs  they are required to use sunlight to support metabolic reactions @xcite .",
    "however , it has been observed that green sulfur bacteria can live in extremely low light conditions , even when receiving only a few hundred photons _ per bacterium _ per second @xcite .",
    "these facts have inspired many conjectures and discussions on the functional properties , energy conversion efficiency and robustness of lhc in green sulfur bacteria  @xcite .    in order to address this controversy",
    "we introduce a model which includes atomistic structural detail of the green bacteria lhc and allows for the simulation of excitation energy transfer ( eet ) at the systems level . as a specific example , we consider the lhc of _ chlorobium tepidum_. we observe fast relaxation of excitations within the subunits of lhc owing to the large overlap between exciton states and strong interaction with environmental fluctuations .",
    "the transfer between subunits involves collective excited states of the pigment molecules and supports the hypothesis of supertransfer @xcite .",
    "the energy transport is robust to different initial excitation conditions , and changes in temperature .",
    "finally , we show that the population of different parts of the lhc can be described using simple kinetic equations with time - dependent transfer rates characterizing intra - unit dynamics .",
    "this later model naturally explains the multiple timescales of eet reported in optical studies of green sulfur bacteria  @xcite and green non - sulfur bacteria  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models have been applied mostly to single functional units of lhcs  @xcite in order to understand the physical principles of energy transfer .",
    "some of these studies also involved atomistic structures  @xcite , which make the models computationally demanding . to the authors knowledge",
    "there are only a few atomistic studies of the complete light - harvesting systems of purple bacteria  @xcite but none for green sulfur bacteria .",
    "in addition to the large scale calculations the detailed analysis of excitation dynamics on the systems level  @xcite is complicated due to the lack of structural information .",
    "thus , one usually needs to use macroscopic phenomenological models @xcite or introduce additional constraints and approximations on the transport models  @xcite .",
    "the lhc in green sulfur bacteria is composed of bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) pigment molecules .",
    "these monomers aggregate in several interconnected functional units , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon]*a*. the main element of lhc is the chlorosome - an ellipsoidal shaped body of size ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers @xcite .",
    "the chlorosome is densely packed with bchl  @xmath0 pigments .",
    "two other functional units - the baseplate  @xcite and the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) trimer complex  @xcite are composed of bchl  @xmath1 pigments held together by a protein scaffolding .",
    "energy in the form of molecular excitations ( _ i.e. _ exciton ) is collected by the chlorosome and funneled through these antenna units to the reaction center where charge carriers are then generated .",
    "the distance between the pigments in lhcs is sufficiently large such that the overlap of electronic wave functions can be neglected . in this case",
    "the energy transfer is mediated by the near field interaction between molecular electronic transitions , the f@xmath2rster interaction  @xcite .",
    "if the interaction between several molecules is sufficiently strong as compared to the energy difference between their electronic transitions , the exciton states are delocalized over the group of pigments  @xcite .",
    "the preferential direction for energy transport is controlled by the frequencies of electronic transitions : the excitation goes to molecules or groups of molecules with lower excited state energy , while dissipating the energy difference to the environment .      a single lhc of _ chlorobium tepidum _",
    "contains 200250 thousand bchl molecules @xcite .",
    "most of these molecules are found in the chlorosome .",

    "the constructed model of the light - harvesting apparatus contains 95% of bchl _ c _ and 5% of bchl _ a _ , which is comparable to the stochiometry of the natural system ( 99% and 1% )  @xcite .",
    "the estimated density of fmo complexes is about 1 fmo/50nm@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we distribute 6 fmo complexes under the baseplate which occupies about 300nm@xmath3 ( see fig .  [",

    "these shifts can be calculated from the pigment - pigment couplings and the electronic excitations of single bchls , site energies , modified by the local environment  @xcite .",
    "while the couplings can straightforwardly be computed using a screened dipole - dipole model  @xcite , the calculation of site energies requires more complicated models or fitting to experimentally measured optical spectra . here , we set the frequency offset to be aligned with the lowest site energy of the fmo complex  @xcite .",
    "the absorption domains of the baseplate and fmo composed of bchl _ a _ pigments are not clearly distinguishable .",

    "in fact , the absorption band of the baseplate significantly overlaps with that of the chlorosome  @xcite . in order to reproduce these spectra using the constructed model we define the site energy of bchl _ c _ to be 2950@xmath4 , which places the absorption maximum of the chlorosome of about 640@xmath4 above the absorption maximum of fmo complexes ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : cartoon ] and the corresponding spectral densities  @xcite satisfy this condition : the absorption spectra of the antenna units overlap each other significantly , which implies the exciton states in this energy domain are delocalized over the two antenna units .",

    "@xcite proposed to compensate the underestimation of the transfer rate between exciton states with large energy gaps by increasing the spectral density in the high frequency region .",
    "therefore , we note here the exciton transition rate , which involves the exciton transfer with a large energy gap , could be underestimated because the redfield model can only account for the single phonon process .",
    "multiphonon processes could occur in the internal exciton dynamics of the antenna units due to its broad exciton bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gammamatrix]*a * ) .",
    "the internal exciton dynamics of the chlorosome is , however , much faster than the exciton transfer between the antenna units .",
    "thus , the redfield model should give a reasonable results ( timescales ) qualitatively for the exciton funneling process of the photosynthetic apparatus .",

    "the summation is over the domain of interest .",
    "to fully characterize the exciton transfer process of the photosynthetic apparatus model in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , one needs to study the exciton dynamics for all possible initial ( exciton ) states within an ensemble at a finite temperature .",
    "for instance , the initial state prepared by a coherent light source ( laser ) could be considered as a single exciton state  @xcite . as an example , we perform exciton dynamics simulations for two cases of initial excitation at 300k to see how the initial condition affects the eet dynamics .",
    "one is the brightest exciton state of the system hamiltonian of roll a , which is delocalized over roll a ( see the snapshot of fig .  [",

    "this occurs because the roll curvature changes and this induces stronger dipole - dipole interactions between neighboring pigments .",
    "this energy gradient is favorable for the exciton energy funneling because eet from the outermost layer to the baseplate is important .",
    "our choice of the initial states on the roll a is based on this argument .",
    "there are two important factors in determining the exciton transfer between the antenna units .",

    "note that the internal dynamics within the antenna units , such as relaxation and thermal excitation among the exciton states , is incorporated into the time dependence of @xmath34 .",

    "the green sulfur bacteria are thought to be an incredibly efficient light processing machine ( _ cf .",
    "_ purple bacterium in ref .",
    "we studied this system by investigating from all - atoms and a top to bottom approach ( _ cf . _ ref .",
    "the excitation energy transfer route was taken from the chlorosome to the reaction center via the baseplate and fmo , under different initiating conditions .",
    "analysis of the atomistic model indicates that resonant energy transfer is maximized given the multichromophoric excitonic coupling which is due to the molecular arrangements of these parts : the green sulfur bacteria are assembled to be most conducive towards efficient excitation energy transfer within the f@xmath2rster energy transfer regime .",
    "it was further shown that whether the initial excitations are important in the energy funneling process .",
    "though , the results differ qualitatively within a short time limit ( 500fs ) .",
    "none of these scenario s , however , adversely affect the efficiency of energy transfer and the results converge within the overall timescale ( 10ps )  @xcite .",
    "thus the mechanism is robust to initial conditions , including varying temperatures .",
    "this is due mainly to the fast internal exciton dynamics of the chlorosome , which is also observed in refs .",
    "furthermore our measure of cooperativity quantifies this and indicates a preference ( again regardless of initial conditions ) to the polarization in the xy - plane ( cross section of the chlorosome ) , which enhances the excitonic coupling strengths between the exciton states of the chlorosome and the baseplate .",
    "we suggest a multichromophoric effect may prevail over the absence of proximity by exploiting the symmetry in parts of the model .",
    "this calculation of cooperativity indicates a supertransfer effect inherent in : the green sulfur bacteria , which seems to be especially `` tuned '' towards thriving under low light conditions by making use of molecular aggregates , symmetry and self - assembly to capture light and funnel it to the reaction center aided , not hindered , by a fluctuating environment  @xcite .",
    "additionally we would like to comment here on the role of the baseplate in the energy funneling process based on our simulations . in our model study , the baseplate plays the role of a `` bridge '' allowing the exciton energy to funnel down to the fmos from the chlorosome .",
    "the presence of the baseplate eases this process ; without the baseplate energy transfer would be impeded . whilst it could be the case that transfer is allowed without the baseplate- under the condition that the fmo s and chlorosomes be positioned close enough for f@xmath2rster energy transfer- our results indicates that the baseplate offers a preferred route .",
    "the baseplate receives the exciton quickly as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : popen ] and releases the exciton to the fmo complexes steadily . since the chlorosome has a relatively large reorganization energy , which implies strong exciton - phonon couplings to the bath , compared to those of the baseplate and fmo complexes , the exciton could be lost to the environment if it is able to stay in the chlorosome for too long a time .",
    "thus , we would like to introduce the idea of the baseplate as a biological `` exciton capacitor '' .",
    "it seems to be suitably designed for this purpose , making sure the route of the exciton is directed , by receiving the exciton from the chlorosome quickly , keeping the exciton from leaking to the surrounding environment , and supplying it to the fmo .",
    "it does so by providing appropriate excitonic sites , via chromophoric pigments , held in a unique and protein scaffold made of amphiphillic units that cross two very different dielectric boundaries ( the interim gap between dry lipid chlorosomes and the more watery region at the fmos ) in a near perfect 2d lattice form in analogy to an actual capacitor ( condenser ) but made of soft materials .",
    "our model study depends on many undetermined parameters , such as the site energies of the baseplate , distance between the antenna units and the spectral density of the baseplate .",
    "also , the structure of the chlorosome is still arguable  @xcite .",
    "however , our study shows characteristic time constants that fall within sub-100fs - sub-100ps and agree with experimental observations  @xcite ( or see table  [ tab : timeconst ] ) .",

    "<S> the energy is transferred in the form of molecular excitations with very high efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> green sulfur bacteria are considered to be amongst the most efficient light - harvesting organisms . despite multiple experimental and theoretical studies of these bacteria the physical origin of the efficient and robust energy transfer in their light - harvesting complexes </S>",
    "<S> is not well understood . to study excitation dynamics at the systems level we introduce an atomistic model that mimics a complete light - harvesting apparatus of green sulfur bacteria . </S>",
    "<S> the model contains approximately 4000 pigment molecules and comprises a double wall roll for the chlorosome , a baseplate and six fenna - matthews - olson trimer complexes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the fast relaxation within functional subunits combined with the transfer between collective excited states of pigments can result in robust energy funneling . </S>",
    "<S> energy transfer is robust on the initial excitation conditions and temperature changes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the same mechanism describes the coexistence of multiple timescales of excitation dynamics frequently observed in ultrafast optical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> while our findings support the hypothesis of supertransfer , the model reveals energy transport through multiple channels on different length scales . </S>"
