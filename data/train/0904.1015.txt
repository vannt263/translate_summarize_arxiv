    "dimension @xmath218 goldstino field @xmath206 is the goldstino direction @xmath219 , taking into account the gravitational charge @xmath220 and the susy breaking scale @xmath221 .",
    "dimension @xmath222 goldstino field @xmath223 is required to have the same dimension as the grassmann variable @xmath224 and hence @xmath225 .",
    "the downward ( twice ) susy transformations of @xmath212 will lead to @xmath226 .",
    "the upward ( twice ) susy transformations of a chiral field in @xmath128 will lead to the f - term of that field , i.e. @xmath227 for example .",
    "thus , the upward susy transformation of @xmath228 will be @xmath229\\nonumber\\\\ = \\frac{f^2}{m_p^2}&=\\frac{f^4}{m_p^2}[(-\\log\\xi+\\log\\epsilon)^2+\\xi^2 ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fterms ] ) . therefore , from downward and upward susy transformations inside the bracket of @xmath230",

    "therefore , the coefficient of @xmath234 is @xmath235^{1/2}\\label{eq : gravmsusytrans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we labeled the mass as ` mixing ' since we calculated it from the mixing of spin-@xmath43 and spin-@xmath183 components .",

    "note that the vacuum energy is given by @xmath237 where @xmath238 , and @xmath239 for the ds , flat and ads spaces , respectively .",
    "namely , @xmath240 and the gravitino mass in the curved space has the same form in terms of @xmath221 , i.e. @xmath241 does not cancel @xmath242 exactly in the curved space .",
