    "according to gamow theory of alpha decay @xcite , this fundamental radioactive decay can be considered as a two - step process @xcite . in the first step",
    ", an alpha cluster is formed inside the parent nucleus .",
    "the resulting alpha particle resides in a metastable state of an average potential of the daughter system . in the second step , the particle tunnels through the potential barrier .",
    "each step requires different theoretical treatment . to compute the preformation factor that describes the alpha formation probability",
    ", one needs to evaluate the overlap integral involving wave functions of the parent and daughter nuclei , and that of the alpha particle .",
    "the estimate of the penetration probability requires a careful treatment of the resonance state .",
    "the commonly used formulation of the alpha - decay problem employs the r - matrix expression @xcite @xmath4 for the absolute width . in this formalism , the first stage ( formation of alpha particle with angular momentum @xmath5 ) is given by the reduced width @xmath6 , while the second stage ( decay ) is expressed by means of the penetrability @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , the absolute width can be obtained from the general reaction - theory expression @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the alpha - spectroscopic factor and @xmath10 is the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "decay width .",
    "historically , expression ( [ grmatrix ] ) was derived in 1954 by thomas @xcite using the time - independent r - matrix theory of nuclear reactions . in 1957 ,",
    "mang @xcite developed the alpha - decay formalism based on the time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "he made the connection with the shell model and succeeded in expressing the alpha - decay formation amplitude in a basis of s.p .",
    "states . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite formulations of thomas and mang are formally equivalent ; there are , however , many differences when it comes to practical implementations .    the reduced width calculated in a shell - model configuration expressed in the harmonic oscillator ( h.o . )",
    "basis is too small .",

    "the configuration mixing calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite in the valence space of @xmath0po assumed the seniority - zero ( pairing vibrational ) wave functions obtained by considering the monopole pairing interaction between like nucleons .",
    "however , all these improvements were not sufficient to reproduce the experimental alpha decay in @xmath0po .",
    "it is only after the valence proton - neutron interaction had been considered together with a generalized wave function expressed as a combination of cluster and shell model components @xcite that theoretical and experimental widths could be reconciled @xcite .",
    "the r - matrix expression for the width ( [ grmatrix ] ) depends on the channel radius @xmath11 .",
    "this radius should be chosen large enough so that the alpha - daughter interaction in the external region is given by the coulomb force alone @xcite .",
    "the infinite range of the coulomb force implies , however , that the asymptotic behavior of the r - matrix expression is reached only at large values of @xmath11 , at which the asymptotic behavior of the shell - model s.p .",
    "basis ( h.o . basis in most applications ) used to calculate @xmath12 , does matter . due to the mismatch between the internal part of the s.p . wave function ( well described in the h.o .",
    "basis ) and the asymptotic part ( poorly or not described in the h.o . basis ) , rather small changes in @xmath11 may produce appreciable variations in penetrability .",
    "physically , the reason for this sensitivity is the fact that the alpha cluster is formed in the surface region of the nucleus in which the coupling to the alpha continuum that impacts the radial behavior of the formation amplitude is important @xcite .",
    "consequently , the absolute r - matrix width depends in general on the channel radius @xcite , and this is an obvious drawback of the method @xcite .",
    "our renewed interest in the alpha - decay problem is stimulated by the recent experimental data above the doubly - magic @xmath13sn @xcite that demonstrate the presence of very fast alpha decays .",
    "indeed , the observed enhancement of the reduced widths of @xmath14te relative to @xmath15po is two - to - three , thus confirming earlier expectations @xcite of  superallowed \" alpha decays in this region due to the large overlaps of valence s.p . shell model proton and neutron wave functions .",

    "indeed , all the valence proton shells are resonances .",

    "the latter approach yielded results consistent with experimental value , but only after considering the antisymmetrization and normalization of the decay channel wave function .",
    "the r - matrix estimate underestimates the experimental width by a factor of @xmath137 .",
    "the r - matrix expression depends on the asymptotic value of the formation amplitude that is very sensitive to the size of the configuration space . on the other hand ,",
    "the reaction - theory expression ( [ goverlap ] ) involves the spectroscopic factor  an integral quantity that depends less on the size of the basis used .",
    "it is very encouraging to see that a reasonable agreement with the experimental width of @xmath0po has been obtained without explicitly considering the alpha - cluster component in the wave function of the parent nucleus . in this context , we believe that the improved treatment of the particle continuum has been essential .    we have also provided an estimate of the alpha - decay rate in @xmath1te .",
    "unfortunately , due to the fact that the valence proton shells in this nucleus lie in the continuum , no fully convergent result has been achieved .",
    "we hope to improve the situation in the future by inclusion of the non - resonant continuum space that will remove some of the undesired oscillations in @xmath138 at large distances .",
    "in addition , since the residual interaction employed in our work neglects the proton - neutron components , and the wave function has a seniority - zero character based on @xmath139 nucleonic pairs , the predicted alpha width in this @xmath135 nucleus should be viewed as a conservative low limit . indeed , the inclusion of @xmath134 correlations is expected to increase the value of @xmath136 significantly .",
    "the calculations presented in this study should be considered as an important step towards an improved microscopic understanding of the alpha - decay process . still , as this work demonstrates , further improvements are needed .",
    "the neglect of the non - resonant continuum , i.e. , complex - energy scattering states in the berggren ensemble , slightly violates the completeness relation at a one - body level .",
    "this results in small imaginary contributions to spectroscopic factors and reduced widths , and  most importantly  can affect the behavior of formation amplitudes at very large distances .",
    "the second crucial development will be the use of large - scale shell model calculations , including realistic @xmath134 and @xmath139 interactions , to compute wave function amplitudes .",
