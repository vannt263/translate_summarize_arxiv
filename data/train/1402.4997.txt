    "according to its standard definition @xcite , light polarization refers to the ellipse described in time by the real component of the electric - field vector of a harmonic wave .",
    "hence partial polarization can then be understood as the rapid and random succession of more or less different polarization states . in the quantum realm , we find that the electric field can never display a well - defined ellipse , just in the same way that particles can not follow definite trajectories @xcite .",
    "this is because the ( field ) quadratures satisfy the same commutation relations of position and linear momentum , and brings in several remarkable consequences : ( i ) there is no room for the classic , textbook definition of polarization , ( ii ) the simple and elegant picture of partial polarization as a random succession of definite ellipses gets lost , and ( iii ) any quantum light state is partially polarized because of unavoidable ( quantum ) fluctuations .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate whether these inconvenient quantum consequences can be overcome resorting to the bohmian picture of quantum mechanics .",
    "polarization is a preferential laboratory for the analysis and application of fundamental aspects of the quantum theory . in this regard",
    ", one can get profit from tools coming from the latter to analyze optical behaviors .",
    "this is the case , for instance , when we consider the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite , which allows us to introduced suitable well - defined trajectories into the domain of quantum optics without violating any fundamental principle .",
    "bearing this in mind , here we address the question of whether the set of trajectories determined by the bohmian picture can still provide a reliable representation of polarization for quantum light states as an ensemble of electric - field trajectories .",
    "this would provide us with a rather intuitive model to understand quantum light closer to the original idea of polarization .",
    "recently the trajectories described by the electric field of one - photon two - mode states have been determined by following this approach @xcite . here",
    "we extend the analysis to more relevant examples of classical - like two - mode field states , namely as glauber and su(2 ) coherent states @xcite .",
    "we specifically focus on this kind of states because a priori one might naively expect that they would constitute the appropriate arena to disclose the statistical description of polarization we are looking for .",
    "surprisingly , we have found that for all these examples of classical - like light the electric - field trajectories are clearly incompatible with classical electrodynamics .",
    "actually , for the su(2 ) states we have found that they are far away from even resembling ellipses . for completeness , these results are compared to polarization trajectories associated with highly nonclassical stationary field , such as @xmath0 states .",
    "the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator has been considered as a working model in previous bohmian analyses @xcite , although it is typically associated with matter waves .",
    "notice that the bohmian approach is traditionally linked to quantum mechanics , and only recently it has also been used in problems involving electromagnetic fields ( photons )  even if in the 1970s and 1980s a few authors already considered the possibility to extend the bohmian approach to electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , in the area of quantum polarization , which we consider here , it has been little exploited as an analysis working tool .",
    "here we report on an intriguing result , namely that bohmian trajectories may reveal nonclassical polarization dynamics displayed by polarization field states that universally regarded as classical .",
    "this work has been organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the prescriptions to define polarization trajectories as well as a discussion on the influence of singular points on the polarization dynamics .",
    "the dynamics associated with the polarization trajectories for coherent , classical - like states are reported and discussed in section  [ sec3 ] , while in section  [ sec4 ] we deal with the counterpart for nonclassical @xmath0 states . to conclude ,",
    "a series of final remarks are summarized in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "usually the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics is applied to the evolution of a particle in its position ( configuration ) space , which involves the wave function in the corresponding coordinate representation . in this work",
    "we make an effective transfer of this formulation to the evolution of a two - mode electric field , which involves the corresponding wave function for the field variables .",
    "fortunately , such a transition is quite simple and straightforward , since each field mode is formally equivalent to a mechanical harmonic oscillator .    to take advantage of that equivalence in the simplest terms , we recall that a one - dimensional mechanical harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath1 with hamiltonian @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 being its position and linear momentum . this hamiltonian can be quite conveniently described in terms of the dimensionless creation @xmath5 and destruction @xmath6 operators , defined as @xmath7 with @xmath8 , and that satisfy the commutation relation @xmath9 = 1 $ ] , so that @xmath10 .    likewise , a quantum one - mode electric field of frequency @xmath11 can be readily described by the complex amplitude operator @xmath12 as @xmath13 in the complex representation .",
    "the operators @xmath12 and @xmath14 satisfy the same commutation relation of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , this is @xmath15 = 1 $ ] . regarding the real and imaginary parts of @xmath16 ,",
    "the following quadrature operators are defined @xmath17 which satisfy the commutation relation @xmath18 = i$ ] .",
    "these operators can be regarded , respectively , as the field counterparts of the mechanical position @xmath3 and linear momentum @xmath4 operators .",
    "this allows us to introduce the quadrature representation of any one - mode field state @xmath19 as @xmath20 in terms of the eigenstates @xmath21 of the quadrature operator @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . in this representation",
    "the quadrature operators become @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "after eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) and ( [ a ] ) the equivalence between the mechanical oscillator and the field mode can be carried out in very simple terms if we take units in which @xmath26 .",
    "for example , the free - field hamiltonian reads @xmath27 .",
    "more importantly , we can easily construct the wave functions for the number states @xmath28 and the coherent states @xmath29 , defined by the eigenvalue equations @xmath30 in terms of their mechanical counterparts after eqs .",
    "( 4.1.32 ) and eqs .",
    "( 4.3.41 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the corresponding hermite polynomials , and @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "both expressions can be easily derived from the the eigenvalue equations ( [ eig ] ) and the differential form of the couple - amplitude operator @xmath35 in the quadrature representation @xmath36 .",
    "after this transformation from quantum mechanics to quantum optics , the only care to be taken is to remember that here @xmath37 does not represent a position , but the electric field in the form of the field quadrature @xmath22 .",
    "this allows us the following fruitful translation to polarization of the bohmian formulation of the evolution of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .      in analogy to the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics or , in short , bohmian mechanics @xcite",
    ", polarization trajectories described by the transverse electric field for two - mode harmonic light can be obtained by solving the guidance equation @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 denote the real , transverse components of the electric - field strength in cartesian coordinates , @xmath40 is the phase of the field - state wave function in quadrature representation , and the gradient @xmath41 is taken with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "notice that , as in the usual bohmian formulation , we have recast the electric field wave function in polar form , @xmath42 where we have assumed the field state @xmath43 to be pure , and @xmath44 represents the eigenstates of the corresponding quadrature operators .",
    "notice that because light polarization just describes the time - evolution of the electric field , its configuration space is given by the electric - field variables @xmath45 , which play the same role as the coordinates @xmath46 in the case of particle dynamics . once the general guidance equation is established , sets of polarization trajectories are determined by plugging the corresponding quantum field state ( its phase ) into this equation , and then solving it for some particular set of initial conditions , as in classical mechanics .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in the quantum case all the information about the polarization state is encoded in the scalar wave function @xmath47 . more importantly ,",
    "since @xmath47 represents a probability amplitude , its phase has no classical analog .",
    "therefore everything about the polarization trajectories relies on a nonclassical object , and hence we should expect that most conclusions derived from the phase of @xmath48 will have no classical counterpart at all .      except for the glauber coherent states , here we have essentially focused on stationary states , and hence the topology of their phase in the polarization configuration space is going to be time - independent .",
    "this means that any motion will be associated with this topology rather than with the time - evolution of the phase gradient , as shown in @xcite . in this case , the mathematical framework of the stability theory is of much interest , for it may allow us to elucidate dynamical properties by identifying possible equilibrium points @xcite .",
    "this points are going to determine the behavior of the polarization trajectories in their vicinity and , therefore , the general dynamical landscape associated with each quantum state .    the nodes or zeros of the wave function , where @xmath49 and the phase @xmath40 is undefined , constitute the first kind of candidate to equilibrium point .",
    "as is well known @xcite , nodes or phase singularities organize the global spatial structure of the flow of an optical field .",
    "this follows from stoke s theorem , which states that unless the curl of certain vector field is 0 within a certain region ( irrotational flow ) , the line integral around a closed loop enclosing such a region ( i.e. , the circulation of such a vector field ) will be nonzero .",
    "if this vector field is identified with the phase gradient , then we know that this quantity will be invariant under the addition to the phase of any integer multiple of @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , if the curl of @xmath51 is nonzero , its circulation will be quantized .",
    "this is precisely what we observe in the case of bohmian trajectories that whirl around a node of the wave function @xcite , where the quantization is in terms of integer multiples of @xmath52 .",
    "of course , this also holds for the polarization trajectories that we are dealing with here , since @xmath53 as it can be inferred from the latter integral , the presence of zeros in the wave function allows the introduction of a circulation number or topological charge , @xmath54 .",
    "this number has to be an integer , since the line integral provides the change experienced by the phase after an excursion returning to the original point @xcite . or , in topological terms , it accounts for the number of jumps between different equivalent points of the riemann surface described by the logarithm of the wave function . in all cases examined in this work",
    ", the trajectories around the zeros will be nearly circular in a neighborhood of the node , giving rise to a vortical dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in quantum mechanics , it was dirac who first noticed this effect @xcite , suggesting the existence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "the concept of magnetic monopole has been further developed in the literature within the grounds of quantum hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recently it has also been possible to recreate in laboratory conditions dirac s monopoles making use of the properties displayed by different materials , such as crystals made of spin ice @xcite or bose - einstein condensates of rubidium atoms @xcite . or course , strictly speaking , these are not elementary monopoles , but quasi - particles arising as an emergent phenomenon associated with a collective behavior , which display analogous properties to the hypothesized dirac monopole .    critical or stationary points , i.e. , points at which all partial derivatives of a given function are zero , constitute the second kind of equilibrium point that we may identify . in our particular context ,",
    "stationary points @xmath55 will produce a vanishing phase gradient , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "that is , given the guidance equation ( [ ge ] ) , we will find @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "in all the cases examined in this work , the trajectories near these points are hyperbolic , with the corresponding value of @xmath55 being a saddle point of the velocity field @xmath41 . we have found no maxima or minima of @xmath40 , which would lead respectively to sinks and sources of trajectories .",
    "it is worth noticing that both nodes and stationary points are zeros of the current density , @xmath59 .",
    "nonetheless , the role played by these two types of equilibrium points is different .",
    "the asymptotically stable and unstable branches associated with the stationary points define separatrices around the nodes , which determine domains with different dynamical behavior . in particular , the direction of the flow around the nodes changes the sign when one passes from the domain of one of these nodes to another adjacent one . as it will be seen below , in some cases these domains",
    "are included within a larger domain with a preferential flow direction , while in others the full configuration space is totally divided in domains without enabling the appearance of larger domains .",
    "two - mode quadrature coherent states , typically known as glauber coherent states and denoted as @xmath60 , constitute the paradigm of classical light .",
    "their electric - field wave function after eq .",
    "( [ psia ] ) is in this two - mode field scenario : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are real two - dimensional vectors defined according to the relation @xmath64 , being @xmath65 .",
    "thus these vectors evolve in time as @xmath66 with @xmath67 for @xmath68 . since the phase is @xmath69 the guidance equation is simply @xmath70 , which can be easily solved analytically to give @xmath71 this is to say @xmath72     polarization trajectories for a two - mode coherent state with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "the background represents a contour - plot of the probability density associated with the one - cycle averaged probability distribution for the electric field @xmath79    as happens with the bohmian trajectories of a quantum harmonic oscillator , here we also notice that any trajectory associated with a glauber state displays the same topology and keeps a constant distance with respect to the most probable one , as it is inferred from eq .",
    "( [ tr2 ] ) . in this case , this topology coincides with the polarization ellipse of a classical harmonic wave with complex - amplitude vector @xmath80 . nonetheless , only the most probable trajectory ( the solid line in fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    "is centered at the origin ; any other trajectory will be slightly displaced , as mentioned before ( see dashed and dotted lines in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . despite coherent states are regarded as typical examples of classical - like light",
    ", such a displacement constitutes an important difference with respect to what one would expect from classical electrodynamics , namely zero displacement ( i.e. , concentric trajectories ) .",
    "the two - mode glauber coherent states define another interesting family of classical - like states regarding polarization , namely the su(2 ) coherent states .",
    "these states arise after recasting the two - mode glauber coherent states as @xcite @xmath81 here @xmath82 denotes the su(2 ) coherent state with @xmath83 photons , which reads explicitly as @xmath84 where @xmath85 are two - mode photon - number states , and ( assuming @xmath86 real without loss of generality ) @xmath87 it is worth noting that the polarization state , as given by the stokes parameters , is the same for the glauber coherent states and all the su(2 ) coherent states in eq .",

    "this example illustrates without loss of generality the results we have found for all cases examined , specifically that there are @xmath83 nodes located along the major axis of the classical ellipse associated with the complex vector @xmath80 . in the vicinity of the nodes , the trajectories are nearly circular @xcite , as can be better seen in the enlargement around the central node provided in fig .",

    "[ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the trajectory that passes just through the two stationary points is a separatrix , which separates the three dynamical domains associated with each note from a single outer domain , where the trajectories move around the all three nodes . actually , far from the nodes the trajectories approach circles .",
    "this can be readily shown analytically by considering the approximation @xmath100 for large @xmath37 , and substituting it into the wave function ( [ wfcn ] ) , which yields @xmath101 and hence @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 along each trajectory , which define a circular motion .",

    "the values @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath95 have been considered again .",
    "an enlargement showing the dynamical details in the vicinity of one of the hyperbolic stationary points and the adjacent nodes can be seen in the right panel .",
    "the nodes form an array of @xmath108 domains , where the trajectories are nearly circles with @xmath109 . in this case , the sign of @xmath54 is always opposite for nearest neighbors . on the other hand , the stationary points form a @xmath110 array , such that the corresponding separatrices divide the configuration space into isolated domains regardless of how far we find from the nodes . these points are located along the diagonals connecting nodes with the same sign of @xmath54 and , again , the trajectories in their vicinity display a hyperbolic topology .",
    "we have addressed a bohmian approach to light polarization in quantum optics @xcite by computing the trajectories described by the electric field of some classical - like two - mode states . in general",
    ", we have noticed that for glauber coherent states all trajectories have the same elliptic form of the mean field , even if they are not centered at the origin . to some extent ,",
    "this was an expected result .",
    "however , for su(2 ) coherent states , the corresponding trajectories are further away from being ellipses .",
    "this can be ascribed to the fact that , although su(2 ) coherent states are stationary , they are still able to exhibit a trajectory dynamics due to local phase variations , i.e. , to a purely geometric origin , as previously shown in the case of single - photon superpositions @xcite .",
    "now , what is really quite remarkable here is the fact that polarization trajectories may display a dynamics far beyond the expected classical elliptical trajectories , even in the case of polarization field states that are universally regarded as classical .",
    "instead , the results reported show that many different trajectories , with very different topologies , are compatible with every single state , which is in compliance with some recent quantum - polarization approaches , where the degree of polarization can never reach unity @xcite .    in principle",
    ", these new results should be observable in practice in virtue of the close relationship between the bohmian picture of quantum dynamics and the concept of weak measurement @xcite .",
    "notice that this connection has already been proven experimentally in benchmark experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has also been adapted to the case where the bohmian trajectories hold in the field - quadrature space by means of the homodyne scheme , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as shown here , the strange dynamics reported for su(2 ) coherent states is primarily determined by the equilibrium points of the electric - field wave function , in particular a web of vortices .",
    "analogously , this geometrical nature has also been observed in nonclassical light .",
    "this naturally leads to the issue of bohmian chaos @xcite , which is absent in all cases analyzed here , because vortices need to be evolving in time . in 1995",
    "parmenter and valentine @xcite showed that just a linear superposition of eigenstates of a 2d anisotropic harmonic oscillator might lead to chaos under some specific conditions , an idea that makowski and frackowiak @xcite further analyzed later on in 2001 , identifying the `` simplest non - trivial model of chaotic bohmian dynamics '' .",
    "nonetheless , the link between bohmian chaos and vorticality was first established by frisk in 1997 @xcite , and more recently wiskniacki , pujals and borondo @xcite have found out that , in particular , it is the movement of vortices what induces the appearance of chaos , which explains why there are no signatures of chaos in our case . from a dynamical viewpoint ,",
    "the states analyzed are all stable , although a slight perturbation would lead to motion of the observed saddle points and , therefore , to the appearance of chaos , although this is a subject that goes beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "the above results , in contradiction with the type of dynamics that one would expect in principle from classical electrodynamics , constitute a quite remarkable issue , since such field states are universally regarded as classical - like concerning polarization . nonetheless , there are some quantum approaches where these states also display nonclassical polarization features , as discussed in @xcite . in this regard , a natural question that arises here",
    "is whether there is any relationship between the manifestation of nonclassical polarization in these approaches and the one here discussed within the bohmian framework .",
    "the answer is positive , there being a straightforward link between them . in terms of a mechanical - like language , the phase gradient in eq .",
    "( [ ge ] ) provides the local value of a linear momentum .",
    "this can be suitably expressed as a local mean value of the momentum either via wigner - moyal phase - space distributions or terletsky - margenau - hill ones @xcite , which are the ones displaying nonclassical behavior in @xcite",
    ". trajectories displaying strange behaviors might be then regarded as the result of quantum polarization distributions incompatible with classical physics .    from the above comments ,",
    "it is clear that glauber and su(2 ) coherent states must be separately analyzed .",
    "the wigner distribution for glauber coherent states is classical ( it is everywhere positive definite ) and , consequently , one should go to nonlinear functions of the trajectories .",
    "this is because nonlinear local moments are related exclusively to terletsky - margenau - hill @xcite , which is nonclassical for glauber coherent states @xcite .",
    "regarding su(2 ) coherent states , their characteristic trait is the presence of vortices governing the topology of the trajectories .",
    "these vortices arise when the amplitude of the wave function vanishes .",
    "this vanishing implies that both the wigner and the terletsky - margenau - hill distributions will be negative definite in regions around vortices . roughly speaking",
    ", this means that the trajectories orbiting the vortices should be influenced by the nonclassical negative values of these distributions .    to conclude , we would like to stress the fact that the definition of the electric - field trajectories has no straightforward classical counterpart .",
    "there seems to be no simple classical analog for the phase of the electric - field wave function .",
