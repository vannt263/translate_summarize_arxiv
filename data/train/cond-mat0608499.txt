    "the transport of biopolymers through nanopores occurs in many biological processes , such as dna and rna translocation across nuclear pores , protein transport through membrane channels , and virus injection  @xcite . due to various potential technological applications , such as rapid dna sequencing  @xcite , gene therapy and controlled drug delivery  @xcite , recently a number of experimental  @xcite ,",
    "theoretical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite studies on polymer translocation have been carried out .    in 1996 , kasianowicz _",
    "et al_.  @xcite demonstrated that single - stranded dna and rna molecules can be driven through the @xmath10-hemolysin channel in a lipid bilayer membrane under an electric field , and the polymer length can be characterized .",
    "in addition , li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and storm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a solid - state nanopore could also be used for similar experiments .",
    "inspired by the experiments  @xcite , a number of recent theories  @xcite have been developed for the dynamics of polymer translocation .",
    "particularly , the scaling of the translocation time @xmath2 with the chain length @xmath0 is an important measure of the underlying dynamics .",
    "sung and park  @xcite and muthukumar  @xcite considered equilibrium entropy of the polymer as a function of the position of the polymer through the nanopore .",
    "standard kramer analysis of diffusion through this entropic barrier yields a scaling prediction of @xmath11 for the field free translocation .",
    "for the forced translocation , a linear dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath0 was suggested , which is in agreement with some experimental results  @xcite for @xmath10-hemolysin channel .",
    "however , as chuang _ et al_.  @xcite noted , the quadratic scaling behavior for the field free translocation can not be correct for a self - avoiding polymer .",
    "the reason is that the translocation time is shorter than the equilibration time of a self - avoiding polymer , @xmath12 , where @xmath6 is the flory exponent  @xcite .",
    "according to scaling theory , they showed that for large @xmath0 , translocation time scales approximately in the same manner as equilibration time .",
    "for the forced translocation , kantor and kardar  @xcite provided a lower bound for the translocation time that scales as @xmath13 , by considering the unimpeded motion of the polymer .",
    "most recently , we investigated both free and forced translocation using both the two - dimensional fluctuating bond model with single - segment monte carlo moves  @xcite and langevin dynamic simulations  @xcite . for the free translocation",
    ", we numerically verified @xmath14 by considering a polymer which is initially placed in the middle of the pore  @xcite . for the forced translocation",
    ", we found a crossover scaling from @xmath15 for relatively short polymers to @xmath16 for longer chains  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also found that this crossover scaling remains unaffected for heteropolymer translocation  @xcite .",
    "the predicted short chain exponent @xmath17 in 3d agrees reasonably well with the solid - state nanopore experiments of storm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "polymer translocation involves a large entropic barrier , and thus most polymer translocation phenomena require a driving force , such as an external electric field used in above mentioned experiments .",
    "however , one can also envisage the use of other forces , such as a pulling force . with the development of manipulation of single molecules , polymer motion can be controlled by optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "this gives a motivation to study the translocation in which only the leading monomer experiences a pulling force .",
    "in addition , a new sequencing technique based on a combination of magnetic and optical tweezers for controlling the dna motion has been reported  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of great importance to theoretically investigate the polymer translocation under a pulling force .",
    "kantor and kardar  @xcite have considered the scaling of @xmath2 with @xmath0 and with the pulling force @xmath1 .",
    "they have also tested the scaling behavior in a mc simulation study of the fluctuation bond model .",
    "however , as discussed below , this model is only valid for moderate pulling forces . for strong pulling forces",
    "the scaling of @xmath2 with @xmath1 is different and needs to be studied carefully . to this end , in this paper we investigate polymer translocation through a nanopore under a pulling force using langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "in our numerical simulations , the polymer chains are modeled as bead - spring chains .",
    "the excluded volume effects and van der waals interactions between all pairs of beads are modeled by a repulsive lj potential as : @xmath18+{\\varepsilon } , & r\\le 2^{1/6}\\sigma;\\\\ 0 , &   r>2^{1/6}\\sigma , \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the diameter of a bead , and @xmath20 is the depth of the potential .",
    "nearest neighbor beads on the chain is connected via a fene spring with a potential @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the separation between consecutive beads , @xmath23 is the spring constant and @xmath24 is the maximum allowed separation between connected beads .    in the langevin dynamics method ,",
    "each bead is subjected to conservative , frictional , and random forces @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , respectively , with  @xcite @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the monomer s mass .",
    "hydrodynamic drag is included through the frictional force , which for individual monomers is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the friction coefficient , and @xmath32 is the monomer s velocity . the brownian motion of the monomer resulting from the random bombardment of solvent molecules is included through @xmath27 and can be calculated using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the conservative force in the langevin equation consists of several terms @xmath33 .",
    "the pulling force is expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath1 is the pulling force strength exerted on the first monomer and @xmath35 is a unit vector in the direction perpendicular to the wall .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider a 2d geometry where the wall in the @xmath36 direction is described as @xmath37 columns of stationary particles within distance @xmath19 from one another and they interact with the beads by the repulsive part of the lennard - jones potential .",
    "wall particle positions do not change during the simulations .",
    "the pore is introduced in the wall by simply removing @xmath38 beads from the wall .",
    "here , we first briefly recall the main results of scaling analysis pioneered by pincus  @xcitewho considered a polymer under traction with two forces , @xmath1 and @xmath39 , act on its end .",
    "the elongation @xmath40 of the chain maybe written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a dimensionless scaling function , @xmath43 , denotes the size of the unperturbed coil , and @xmath44 is the characteristic length of the problem , @xmath45 .    for weak forces , such that @xmath46 , the response is linear , i.e. , @xmath47 , which leads to  @xcite @xmath48 for moderate forces @xmath49 , the chain breaks up into a one - dimensional string of blobs of size @xmath44 .",
    "then the elongation @xmath50 , which leads to @xmath51 .",
    "thus , one obtains  @xcite @xmath52 finally for strong forces @xmath53 , the chain is nearly fully extended with @xmath54    in the following , we use similar arguments to analyze the extension of the tethered chain pulled with a constant force through a viscous medium .",
    "the geometrical impediment due to the finite width of the pore is neglected here . for clarity , we assume that the pulling force acts on the last monomer @xmath0 . without hydrodynamic interactions the force acting on segment @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the velocity of the @xmath58th segement . at steady state",
    "when inertia can be neglected compared with the frictional force , we assume @xmath59 and thus @xmath60 under this physical picture , we stress that the pulling force @xmath1 equals @xmath61 . here",
    ", we encounter a situation in which the tension @xmath62 is segment - dependent and where the stretching of the chain is not uniform  @xcite .    to this end , we generalize eqs .",
    "( [ eq311 ] ) and ( [ eq312 ] ) to this situation , following brochard - wyart  @xcite , who considered the nonuniform deformation of tethered chains in uniform solvent flow .",
    "let @xmath63 be the @xmath55-dependent size of the pincus blobs and @xmath64 the position of the @xmath55th monomer with respect to the last monomer in the direction of the pulling force . for weak forces at @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath65 , the local elongation at site @xmath55 is @xmath66 while for moderate forces , @xmath67 , @xmath68 integrating eqs .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) and ( [ eq33 ] ) over @xmath55 , one finds the deformation obeys @xmath69 for weak forces and @xmath70 for moderate forces . from the scaling picture , the sizes @xmath71 of the pincus blobs obey @xmath72",
    "this can be compared with the case of a tethered chain subjected to a uniform solvent flow  @xcite .",
    "the blob size decreases in the pulling force direction , resulting in a trumpetlike shape . for strong forces ,",
    "the last part of the chain in fully stretched while its free end still shows pincus - type behavior , corresponding to the regime called stem and flower  @xcite .",
    "note that eqs.([eq411 ] ) and ( [ eq412 ] ) can be obtained by simply replacing @xmath1 in eqs.([eq311 ] ) and ( [ eq312 ] ) by an effective force @xmath73 , which means eqs.([eq311 ] ) and ( [ eq312 ] ) are still applicable when one sets @xmath74 .      to examine @xmath2 as a function of @xmath0 under the same constant pulling force @xmath1",
    ", we need to know @xmath40 as a function of the pulling force @xmath1 , not the drag force @xmath75 on monomer .",

    "( [ eq411 ] ) and ( [ eq412 ] ) we need to use relation @xmath76 , which are the same as eqs.([eq311 ] ) and ( [ eq312 ] ) although the microscopic pictures are different .",

    "the polymer travels a distance @xmath40)during the translocation process .",
    "the translocation velocity scales as @xmath77 since the force is applied to one monomer only .",

    "the scale of the pulling force @xmath1 is @xmath93 , which is about 3.3 pn . the langevin equation is integrated in time by a method described by ermak and buckholtz  @xcite in 2d . for the pore",
    ", we set @xmath94 and @xmath95 unless otherwise stated .    to create the initial configuration , the first monomer of the chain is placed in the entrance of the pore .",
    "the polymer is then let to relax to obtain an equilibrium configuration . in all of our simulations we did a number of runs with uncorrelated initial states .",
    "the translocation time is defined as the time interval between the entrance of the first segment into the pore and the exit of the last segment .",
    "the estimate for the translocation time was obtained by neglecting any failed translocation and then calculating the average duration of the successful translocations .",
    "typically , we average our data over 1000 independent runs . in this section ,",
    "we only investigate the translocation under the consant pulling force . for the case with the constant pulling velocity",
    ", we will examine it in detail in future .",
    "the distribution of translocation times for a polymer of length @xmath96 pulled with a force @xmath84 is presented in fig .",
    "the histogram obeys gaussian distribution .",
    "this distribution has a qualitatively different shape compared to that for the free translocation case , where the corresponding distribution is asymmetric , wider and has a long tail  @xcite .",
    "however , this distribution is quite similar to that for driven translocation under an electric field , in that it is narrow without a long tail and symmetric  @xcite .",
    "the stronger the pulling force , the narrower the distribution becomes . as a consequence of this distribution , the average translocation time @xmath2",
    "is well defined and scales in the same manner as the most probable translocation time . of course",

    ", the translocation times are normalized by their average value . ]",
    "the dynamics of a single segment passing through the pore during translocation is an important issue .",
    "the non - equilibrium nature of translocation has a considerable effect on it .",
    "we have numerically calculated the waiting times for all monomers in a chain of length @xmath0 .",
    "we define the waiting time of monomer @xmath8 as the average time between the events that monomer @xmath8 and monomer @xmath9 exit the pore . in our previous work",
    "@xcite for translocation under an electric field in the pore , we found that the waiting time depends strongly on the monomer positions in the chain .",
    "for short polymers , such as @xmath96 , the monomers in the middle of the polymer need the longest time to translocate and the distribution is close to symmetric .",
    "however , for a polymer of length @xmath82 , it s approximately the 220@xmath97 monomer that needs the longest time to translocate on the other side of the pore .",
    "the waiting times for chains of length @xmath96 and @xmath82 under pulling forces are presented in fig .",
    "[ waitingn100 ] .",
    "as compared to the electric field driven case  @xcite , the peaks of the waiting times are shifted towards the last monomers of the chain , independent of the force .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that when the chain is being pulled through the pore , its free energy increases due to loss of configurational entropy . for short chains ,",
    "this leads to the chain motion to slow down almost monotonically until the chain entropies on both sides of the pore roughly balance each other . for long chains",
    ", the entropy of the pulled part eventually exceeds that of the remaining part of the chain and a maximum in waiting time appears close to the end of the chain .     with @xmath84 , ( b ) length @xmath82 with @xmath84.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath84 , ( b ) length @xmath82 with @xmath84.,title=\"fig : \" ]      as a reference point for comparison ,",
    "we first check @xmath2 as a function of @xmath0 for an infinitely wide pore , as shown in fig . [ fig4](a ) .",
    "we obtain in this case that @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath84 and @xmath100 respectively .",
    "the value for @xmath101 is in the moderate force regime while @xmath84 corresponds to the strong force regime .",
    "for both these regimes , the theoretical prediction is @xmath102 , as in eqs .",

    "this shows that @xmath110 is no longer valid since we are in the strong force regime of @xmath111 .",

    "these results show that under the restriction of the wall for a pore of finite width , it is much easier for the chain to become fully stretched and hence the strong force limit scaling behavior holds @xmath7 through the entire range of forces applied .    finally , it is important to note that both in the case of external field ( voltage applied across the pore )  @xcite and pulling force driving the translocation process , there exists a fundamental difference between the monte carlo results for the lattice fluctuating bond model and the continum model considered here in the strong driving force limit . in the monte carlo study , the microscopic transition rate saturates very quickly when the external driving force increases ,",
    "leading to a saturation of the velocity and the translocation time  @xcite .",
    "this aspect of the fluctuating bond model is unrealistic and does not correspond to the true dynamics of the system .",
    "the continum model does not suffer from this artifact . as seen in fig .",

    "in this work , we have investigated the dynamics of polymer translocation through a nanopore under a pulling force using 2d langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "we have focused on the influence of the length of the chain @xmath0 and the pulling force @xmath1 on the translocation time @xmath2 .",
