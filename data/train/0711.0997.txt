    "despite their historical importance in understanding the formation processes of our own galaxy ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ; searle & zinn 1978 ; mackey & gilmore 2004 ; forbes , strader & brodie 2004 ) , detailed studies of the stellar populations of globular cluster ( gc ) systems in spiral galaxies beyond the local group are somewhat limited .",
    "it is important that this be rectified , not only to inform formation models of spiral galaxies , but also to constrain formation models of other morphological types .",
    "for example , ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) proposed that the gc systems of elliptical galaxies represent the merged systems of spiral galaxies plus the addition of newly formed red ( metal - rich ) gcs .",
    "bedregal et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have argued that the gc systems of s0s are consistent with faded spirals",
    ". a better understanding of gc systems in spirals , with a range of types and luminosities , is needed to test these ideas .",
    "imaging studies of gc systems exist for about a dozen spirals ( e.g. kissler - patig et al .",
    "1999 ; larsen , forbes & brodie 2001 ; goudfrooij et al .",
    "when sufficient numbers of gcs are present , they reveal a bimodal colour distribution ( similar to those seen in elliptical galaxies ) with the red ( metal - rich ) subpopulation associated with the galaxy bulge component ( see forbes , brodie & larsen 2001 ) .",
    "spectroscopic studies of gcs in spirals beyond the milky way and m31 ( burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; beasley et al . 2004 ) are even more limited .",
    "schroder et al .",
    "( 2002 ) investigate the stellar population properties of 16 individual gcs in m81 .",
    "similar , or smaller , numbers have been investigated in m104 ( larsen et al .",
    "2002 ) , ngc  253 and ngc  300 ( olsen et al . 2004 ) , and m33 ( chandar et al .",
    "these studies generally find old ages with a wide range of metallicities for the gcs .",
    "some gc systems reveal bulk rotation , while others do not , but small numbers and the lack of edge - on systems make such analyses uncertain ."
