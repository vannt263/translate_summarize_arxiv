    "complex organic molecules ( coms ) have been detected in warm star - forming regions such as omc-1 @xcite and sgr b2 @xcite and are usually associated with warm gas - phase and surface chemistries .",
    "coms are expected to be formed at the surface of the grains during the warm - up phase of star formation when the temperature is about 40 - 50@xmath0k @xcite . under such conditions ,",
    "heavy radicals can move at the surface of the grains and react without being evaporated .",
    "when the temperature gets above 80@xmath0k , the coms are then evaporated in the gas - phase @xcite .",
    "recently , acetaldehyde ( ch@xmath2cho ) , dimethyl ether ( ch@xmath2och@xmath2 ) , methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath2 ) , methanol ( ch@xmath2oh ) and formaldehyde ( h@xmath1co ) have also been observed in the cold pre - stellar cores l1689b @xcite and b1-b @xcite .",
    "these detections have revived the question of the formation of these species and their presence in the gas - phase with abundances ( relative to the total hydrogen ) between @xmath3 to more than @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite proposed that these complex species are formed at low temperature via gas - phase reactions between precursors , such as ch@xmath2o , formed on the grain surface and released through reactive desorption .    at temperature typical of dark clouds or pre - stellar cores ( 10@xmath0k and below ) ,",
    "the direct thermal evaporation is only efficient for h and h@xmath1 .",
    "similarly , the diffusion of the species at the surface of the grains , through thermal hopping , is only efficient for atomic hydrogen , so that hydrogen - rich saturated species , such as h@xmath1o , ch@xmath5 and nh@xmath2 , are the main constituents of the ices .",
    "current chemical models take into account a number of processes to desorb back into the gas - phase species from the surface .",
    "the first one is the desorption induced by stochastic cosmic ray heating @xcite .",
    "this process is however only efficient for simple molecules .",
    "another process was introduced by @xcite in which the chemical energy released by exothermic surface reactions contributes to desorb the products . considering the lack of experimental data on it ,",
    "the efficiency of the process is not well constrained .",
    "@xcite proposed that mantle explosions could be induced by exothermic radical recombination reactions .",
    "they concluded that the energy stored by those free radicals being larger than the energy deposits by cosmic rays , the chemical desorption is the dominant non - thermal desorption mechanism in dark clouds .",
    "another desorption mechanism was considered by @xcite in which the energy released by h@xmath1 formation at the surface of the grains leads to local heating and desorb species back into the gas - phase .",
    "however , only weakly bound species ( with binding energies less than or equal to that of co ) can be evaporated during this process @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies by @xcite showed the efficiency of the photodesorption processes .",
    "the importance of this mechanism has been underlined by @xcite for the desorption of water at a@xmath6 lower than 10 while many observational studies of pre - stellar cores @xcite invoke photodesorption by secondary cosmic ray photons to explain h@xmath1o gas - phase abundances .",
    "whatever the desorption mechanism included in the models , the gas - phase abundances reflect the surface abundances .",
    "the formation of species at the surface of the grains depends on the diffusion rate of the precursors .",
    "this diffusion can be thermal when species migrate from one site to another one by thermal hopping or non - thermal when species cross through a potential barrier by quantum tunneling .",
    "diffusion at the surface of the grains could be faster if tunneling effects are included or if the temperature of the grains is higher .",
    "+ in this paper , we revisit the efficiency of tunneling diffusion based on recent experimental studies of oxygen diffusion @xcite .",
    "we also study the effect of cosmic ray impacts which cause a stochastic heating of the dust particles @xcite allowing for surface radicals to diffuse quickly and react to form more complex species .",
    "we report here the effect of these two mechanisms on molecular abundances and more specially those of complex organic molecules .",
    "note that we do not distinguish between the different layers of ices in our model . as a consequence",
    ", we do not take into account diffusion through the bulk of the ice or any differentiation between the surface and the bulk , which can be an important aspect of surface chemistry as shown by @xcite .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the chemical gas - grain model nautilus and more particularly the grain - surface reactions .",
    "models predictions are presented in section 3 , while comparisons with observations in two dark clouds ( tmc-1 ( cp ) and l134n ) are shown in section 4 .",
    "we present our conclusions about this work in the last section .",
    "we used the nautilus chemical model described in @xcite and @xcite in which the abundance of each species is obtained by solving rate equations for gas - phase and grain - surface chemistries .",
    "the kinetic equations describing the formation and destruction of molecules are : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the gas - phase and surface concentrations of species @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the gas - phase and surface reaction rates , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the desorption and adsorption rates .",

    "the rate coefficient for non - thermal desorption is given by @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48@xmath49 is the fraction of the time spent by grains at 70@xmath0k , defined as the ratio of the time scale for cooling via desorption of volatiles ( @xmath50s ) to the time interval between successive heating to 70@xmath0k , which is estimated to be @xmath51 years for a cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath24s@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "then we have : @xmath52    in addition to the two desorption mechanisms ( thermal desorption and cosmic ray desorption ) previously mentioned , a non - thermal desorption mechanism via exothermic surface reactions is included in the model .",
    "the energy released for each exothermic reaction contributes to desorb the products into the gas - phase .",

    "we only consider langmuir - hinshelwood formation mechanism : a species is adsorbed on the surface of an interstellar grain before reacting with another adsorbed reactant .",
    "the dust grain is then acting as a third body in chemical reactions . because of the low grain temperature expected in molecular clouds , we only consider physisorption ( by van der waals force ) .",
    "we assume a sticking probability of 1.0 for neutral atoms that hit the grain .",
    "the dust grains , made of amorphous olivine , are assumed to be spherical particles with a radius of 0.1@xmath61 m , a density of 3@xmath0g@xmath0 @xmath62 , and we use a dust - to - gas mass ratio of 0.01 .",

    "the time scale for an adsorbed species to migrate from one site to another one via thermal hopping is given by the equation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is from eq .",

    "is given by : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total number of surface sites on a 0.1 @xmath61 m grain .",
    "the diffusion via thermal hopping requires sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier between two adjacent sites .",
    "barrier penetration by quantum tunneling can then be more effective for some species , particularly the lighter ones .",
    "the time scale @xmath78 for species to migrate to an adjacent surface site through a rectangular barrier via quantum tunneling @xcite is : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the barrier thickness estimated to be 1 angstrm .",
    "+ diffusion by quantum tunneling depends on the particle mass : tunneling reaction involving a species with a lighter mass is faster than with a heavier mass . for @xmath81k , the quantum diffusion time for an h atom over an entire grain obtained from equation",
    "is @xmath82s , whereas the thermal hopping diffusion time obtained from equation is @xmath83s . for h@xmath1 , considering @xmath84k , equations and give , respectively , the values @xmath85s and @xmath86s .",
    "+ therefore , because of their low mass and high mobility , we considered surface migration by quantum tunneling for light species h and h@xmath1 .",
    "quantum tunneling for heavier species is only considered for o here , since @xcite presented that , despite its high mass , quantum diffusion may be efficient for oxygen .",
    "their experiments , performed on physisorbed o atoms via the study of o@xmath2 formation , showed that oxygen atoms diffusion is governed by quantum tunneling up to 20@xmath0k .",
    "furthermore , @xcite also studied theoretically the o + co reaction and showed that tunneling strongly increases the reaction rates at low temperature ( 10 - 20@xmath0k ) .",
    "diffusion on dust particles strongly depends on surface temperature .",
    "a higher grain temperature leads to a higher mobility of species on the surface .",
    "when a cosmic ray particle collides with a dust grain , it deposits its energy , heating the grain to a peak temperature of 70@xmath0k @xcite .",
    "the dust grain temperature is then no longer 10@xmath0k but seven times warmer during the fraction of the time @xmath48@xmath87 .",
    "it is the effect of this stochastic heating on the diffusion that we are studying in this paper .",
    "this heating increases the mobility of radicals on the surface of the grain and species will be able to quickly scan the surface since the time scale for species to migrate to an adjacent site will be much faster : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the temporary peak temperature of the grain after heating .",
    "+ therefore , the recombination of radicals on the surface of the grain will be more efficient .",
    "the surface reaction rate @xmath90 between species @xmath11 and @xmath64 due to the diffusivity by cosmic rays is then given by : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the diffusion rate for a grain temperature of 70@xmath0k .",
