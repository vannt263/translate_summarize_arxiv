    "the born - oppenheimer approximation@xmath0 is fundamental to studies of a wide variety of molecular systems .",
    "however , violations of the born - oppenheimer approximation@xmath1 are ubiquitous in many molecular and condensed phase phenomena , and are responsible for several relaxation processes . despite their importance , fully quantum treatments of nonadiabatic corrections to born oppenheimer dynamics are limited and no perturbative formulation exists to account for them .",
    "it is practically impossible to compute the full quantum nonadiabatic dynamics for realistic systems due to the prohibitive computational cost associated with such a calculation . to circumvent this difficulty , a class of mixed quantum classical methods have been invented@xmath2 .",
    "these methods can be broadly classified into mean - field@xmath3 and trajectory surface hopping methods@xmath4 .",
    "mean field methods originate from work by ehrenfest@xmath5 , where the nuclear degrees of freedom , treated as classical mechanical variables , experience a potential that is the expectation value of the electronic hamiltonian with respect to the instantaneous electronic wavefunctions obtained by solving the electronic schrodinger equation . on the other hand , surface hopping methods@xmath4 treat the nuclear dynamics as being localized to a single born - oppenheimer surface at any time , with nonadiabatic couplings between surfaces leading to instantaneous jumps , or `` hops '' between born - oppenheimer surfaces .",
    "common to all mixed quantum - classical methods is the identification of the nuclear ( or slow ) degrees of freedom as behaving as essentially classical quantities , while interacting with a quantum system consisting of the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this identification is usually justified by a mixture of mathematical and phenomenological arguments . as a result , while these methods have been investigated by intuitive tests and computational simulations over the years , there is no rigorous theory to understand situations where this separation into classical and quantum subsystems breaks down and quantum effects on the classical degrees of freedom have to be considered .",
    "this problem is also evident in studies of the dynamics of molecular systems on higher - dimensional born - oppenheimer surfaces , where geometric features , like conical intersections between surfaces , have a significant physical effect on the dynamics .",
    "thus , given the somewhat ad - hoc nature of most mixed quantum classical methods , a central problem is to develop a framework which would incorporate these methods as an approximation and would enable the systematic study of corrections to the mixed quantum classical picture of nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "this work aims to systematically construct mixed quantum classical methods as semiclassical limits of quantum nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "such an approach enables the systematic improvement of mixed quantum classical methods to include further quantum corrections as well as the development of new and hybrid mixed quantum classical methods .",
    "exact path integral descriptions of the quantum nonadiabatic dynamics are provided and stationary phase approximations for the dynamics are derived .",
    "the resulting dynamical picture is a consistent means of obtaining a mixed quantum classical approximation to the nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "it is demonstrated that both the ehrenfest approach and the surface hopping approach correspond to stationary phase approximations of the quantum nonadiabatic dynamics , when studied in complementary representations of the electronic system .",
    "furthermore , the approximate equations of motion obtained in the ehrenfest picture contain additional contributions to the effective nuclear force .",
    "these contributions are a direct , and nontrivial consequence of the geometry of the born - oppenheimer potential energy surfaces . for systems with only one nuclear dimension , these contributions are zero , and the dynamics is of pure ehrenfest type , while for higher dimensional surfaces , they are non - zero , and represent corrections to the quasiclassical dynamics due to the topological features of the surface , like the presence of conical intersections and degeneracies . in the complementary picture from which surface hopping methods are obtained as an approximation , quantum corrections to the nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics can be built in by considering semiclassical expansions of the nuclear propagator in the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "in addition to this , the approach outlined in this paper provides a new interpretation of nonadiabatic effects as a consequence of the geometry of the electronic hilbert space , and thus as arising due to a generalization of berry s phase for parametrized quantum systems .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii , a path integral description of the quantum nonadiabatic dynamics",
    "is introduced .",
    "issues concerning path integral approaches to nonadiabatic dynamics are discussed and the derivation of the approach used in this paper are outlined in sec.ii.a . in sec.ii.b ,",
    "the path integral description is derived .",
    "it is based on integrating out the electronic degrees of freedom using a coherent state basis .",
    "furthermore , the path integral so obtained is compared to other path integral formulations constructed within a born - oppenheimer basis .",
    "it is shown in this section that nonadiabatic couplings between states are due to the geometry of the electronic hilbert space , and can be regarded as generalizations of berry s phase . in sec.iii , the path integral approach is analysed and stationary phase approximations are derived .",
    "sec.iii.a demonstrates that the stationary phase approximation to the coherent state path integral corresponds to the ehrenfest formulation of mixed quantum classical dynamics .",
    "furthermore , geometric corrections to the nuclear force in the ehrenfest approach are obtained .",
    "these corrections are related to the phase coherence between different states , and are most significant when different born oppenheimer energy surfaces become close in energy and are strongly coupled due to nonadiabatic effects .",
    "sec.iii.b studies stationary phase approximations to the complementary path integral description constructed using a born - oppenheimer basis for the electronic system . it is shown that the equations of motion so obtained correspond in the semiclassical limit , to the fewest switches surface hopping approach to nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "the theory in sec.iii.b also points to the construction of semiclassical propagators that can extend descriptions of nonadiabatic dynamics beyond the mixed quantum - classical limit .",
    "sec.iii.c describes semiclassical quantization rules to approximate the eigenvalue spectrum for the full quantum dynamics .",
    "the paper then concludes with a discussion of the results and future work in sec.iv .",
    "the problems with path integral approaches to quantum nonadiabatic dynamics are briefly discussed , and a short outline of the consequent derivation of the path integral based theory is given .",
    "the detailed mathematical treatment of a path integral approach based on coherent states is then subsequently discussed .",
    "it should also be noted that this text uses the units convention where planck s constant is set to one , i.e @xmath6 in this paper .",
    "the nonadiabatic corrections to the born oppenheimer approximation can be viewed as a result of a coupling between a set of `` fast '' or bath degrees of freedom and slow or `` system '' degrees of freedom . however , the mechanisms that result from this coupling are different from the usual problem of a system interacting with a dissipative bath , since the hilbert space enclosing the bath degrees of freedom in the born oppenheimer theory is parametrized by the slow degrees of freedom . as a consequence ,",
    "the time dependent evolution of such a system involves complex geometric phase effects@xmath7 .",
    "pechukas@xmath8 first developed a path integral prescription for nonadiabatic dynamics and derived a set of nonlocal equations of motion for the semiclassical nuclear path .",
    "later work@xmath9 on a path integral description clarified the interpretation of the nonadiabatic coupling vector potentials as nonabelian gauge fields .",
    "however , these descriptions are not easily amenable to approximations which can be studied computationally . in the pechukas formulation",
    ", the effect of the electronic degrees of freedom on system dynamics enters through a nonlocal potential which is a function of the paths taken by the system , and similarly in the formulation of moody , shapere and wilczek@xmath10 , nonadiabatic couplings between born - oppenheimer states enter as path ordered matrix exponentials .",
    "thus , an approach that adopts the path integral framework for the exact nonadiabatic dynamics , but which is also amenable to systematic and computationally tractable approximations would be of considerable theoretical and practical utility .    the problems with regards to nonlocality and path ordered exponentials encountered in a path integral description of the quantum nonadiabatic dynamics can be partially resolved by an appropriate choice of the path integral . to this end",
    ", a local basis of continuous , @xmath11-particle coherent state slater determinants is chosen to describe the electronic system .",
    "the use of coherent states enables the straightforward construction of stationary phase approximations to the quantum dynamics and corresponding semiclassical quantization rules .",
    "furthermore , since the propagator can be written as a functional integral over a continuous coherent state space , issues relating to path ordering and nonlocality become considerably simplified .",
    "the coherent state basis is parametrized by the nuclear coordinates and is overcomplete .",
    "since the basis is parametrized by the nuclear coordinates , a local hilbert space is defined at each point on a given nuclear path .",
    "thus , intuitively , motion along a nuclear path involves the following : the first contribution is due to the propagation of the nuclear part of the hamiltonian , and the second is due to a rotation of the hilbert space from one point into the next one on the path ( fig 1 ) .",
    "this rotation takes basis states at one point into the basis states at the next , and hence changes the electronic contribution to the effective nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "in addition , the rotation of the basis in general involves `` twists '' and skews resulting in torsional contributions to the force acting on the nuclear degrees of freedom .    to explicitly describe this , the derivation of the coherent state path integral proceeds as follows .",
    "the matrix elements of the time propagation operator for the full ( nuclear plus electronic ) hamiltonian between initial and final nuclear positions are written down as a path integral .",
    "the time for propagation is broken up into a large number of ( infinitesimal ) time segments and the propagation operator is written in a trotter product expansion .",
    "complete sets of nuclear position eigenstates are then introduced for each time segment , and an infinitesimal propagator between successive nuclear positions is written down . the resulting expression is a path integral of an operator acting on the electronic degrees of freedom over each nuclear path . for a given nuclear path , this quantity simply corresponds to the electronic propagation operator parametrized by the nuclear path .",
    "the matrix elements of the quantum nonadiabatic propagation operator between initial and final electronic states and nuclear positions are then evaluated through the matrix elements of this path dependent quantity between initial and final electronic states .",
    "this is done by adding overcomplete sets of electronic @xmath11 particle coherent state slater determinants at each time slice and evaluating matrix elements of the infinitesimal propagation operator .",
    "the overlap between these basis states belonging to consecutive timesteps gives rise to the nonadiabatic coupling contribution to the dynamics .",
    "the resulting path integral is then further analysed .",
    "the full hamiltonian for a system with nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom can be written as @xmath12 the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 the coordinates @xmath15 denote the @xmath16 nuclear degrees of freedom with momenta given by @xmath17 .",
    "the potential energy function , @xmath18 is the bare nuclear potential .",
    "the electronic hamiltonian can be similarly defined and the electronic coordinates , @xmath19 , are elements of the vector @xmath20 .",
    "the electronic potential energy @xmath21 is parametrically dependent on the nuclear positions .",
    "@xmath22 for simplicity of presentation , the nuclei and electrons are assumed to be spinless .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for the nonadiabatic effects considered here , and the treatment that follows can be extended to include spin effects .",

    "this is solely for notational convenience and does not significantly affect the conclusions of this work .",

    "it is important to note that the matrix elements of the propagation operator described in eq.(6 ) are still operators acting on the electronic hilbert space .",
    "this is because the matrix elements are a partial trace with respect to the eigenstates @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the nuclear position operator @xmath34 .",
    "this partial trace can be rewritten as a path integral over the set of nuclear paths @xmath35 .",

    "physically , the operator @xmath39 $ ] includes the `` connection '' between electronic hilbert spaces defined at each point on a given nuclear path @xmath40 .",
    "thus , a complete solution of the nonadiabatic problem would require that electronic matrix elements of @xmath38 be evaluated . to perform such an evaluation , overcomplete sets of antisymmetric @xmath11 electron slater determinant coherent state wavefunctions",
    "are introduced at each nuclear position along a given nuclear path@xmath41 .    a general @xmath11",

    "hence , this local electronic basis is parametrized by the nuclear position to account for the fact that a local electronic hilbert space exists at each nuclear position .",
    "for such a basis defined for a nuclear position @xmath44 , the completeness relation reads : @xmath45 for notational convenience , the integration measure in the overcompleteness relation will be written as @xmath46 = \\frac{d\\phi^{*}({\\bf r})d\\phi({\\bf r})}{(2\\pi i)^{n}}e^{-\\mid\\phi({\\bf r})\\mid^{2}}\\ ] ] with the differentials and the absolute value of @xmath47 defined by @xmath48 the parametrization of the electronic hilbert space by the nuclear position is responsible for geometric phase effects .",
    "as will be shown below , these effects enter through the definition of a local basis of wavefunctions at each nuclear position .",

    "more specifically , the coherent states inserted at successive timesteps , @xmath53 , are parametrized by different sets of nuclear positions , @xmath54 .",
    "since there is no constraint on the basis states at different nuclear positions , all possible matrix elements of the time evolution operator between these basis states will have to be considered .",
    "furthermore , to evaluate this off - diagonal matrix element , an additional set of basis states parametrized by the position @xmath55 is introduced at time @xmath56 .",

    "this lack of constraint is unlike the cases encountered with more traditional coherent state path integrals where only diagonal matrix elements between coherent states suffice , and is a consequence of the parametrization by the nuclear coordinates .",

    "thus , these factors correspond to a generalization of the canonical , or berry s phase for simple , parameter dependent hamiltonians@xmath62 . to obtain a more familiar form for this phase dependence ,",
    "the connection factors can be rewritten as follows : @xmath63 the difference @xmath64 is the difference between the wavefunctions @xmath65 evaluated at successive time steps .",
    "@xmath66    on exponentiating and making the assumption that the basis wavefunctions @xmath65 vary continuously , the connection factor takes the form @xmath67 where the time derivative acts on the wavefunction @xmath65 .",

    "as noted earlier , the necessity of choosing two sets of coherent states at each time slice in the path integral means that the paths in general are discontinuous .",
    "this is because , in the limit where the discrete time slicing in the path integral is made infinitesimally small , the choice of different states at each such time slicing corresponds to a discontinuous jump in the space of coherent states .",
    "however , the stationary phase limit of the path integral involves continuous paths in state space .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to reduce the unconstrained sum over all ( discontinuous and continuous ) paths to one where the coherent states are constrained to be similar to each other .",
    "a simple way of doing this is to assume the overlap , @xmath79 , to be nearly unity .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation also because contributions to the path integral when this overlap is small are negligible .",
    "this can be seen from the discrete version of the path integral , eq.(13 ) and eq.(16 ) , from which it is clear that as the overlap goes to zero , the exponent in the path integral becomes highly oscillatory , and in addition is multiplied by the small overlap .",
    "the action when the overlap is assumed to be unity can be considered to be a zeroth order approximation to the full action , when expanded in terms of the overlap . with this simplification ,",
    "the path integral action becomes : @xmath72 = \\int_{0}^{t}{\\big[l_{n}({\\bf r},\\dot{\\bf r } ) + \\langle\\phi({\\bf r})\\mid i\\overleftrightarrow{\\partial}_{\\tau } - h_{e}\\mid\\psi({\\bf r})\\rangle\\big]d\\tau}\\ ] ] this action has a simple interpretation .",
    "the time derivative part of the action corresponds to the nonabelian generalization of berry s phase , while the other parts correspond to the dynamical evolution of the system .",

    "in contrast to the case of a simple berry phase , this `` gauge '' potential is an infinite dimensional matrix and corresponds to a nonabelian geometric phase .",
    "thus the nonadiabatic coupling between born oppenheimer surfaces has a purely geometric interpretation as arising due to the parallel transport of a local basis of electronic wavefunctions along a nuclear path .",

    "although the approach presented here is physically equivalent to that of moody , shapere and wilczek , the use of electronic coherent states enables semiclassical approximations to the nonadiabatic quantum dynamics .",

    "this invariance is a general version of the the usual invariance under gauge transformations , of vector potentials and magnetic fields in classical electromagnetism .",
    "it should be noted that the unitary transformations under which the electronic wavefunction basis transforms are infinite dimensional matrices , and hence the group , @xmath126 that these unitary transformations belong to is the group of symmetries for the nonadiabatic corrections . on the other hand , the terms in the equations of motion which are gradients of the electronic energy eigenstates break this symmetry ,",
    "since the energy eigenvalues are , in general , not completely degenerate . when degeneracies exist for a subset of the electronic energy levels , the contribution to the nuclear force from the degenerate states is symmetric under unitary transformations corresponding to the degenerate subspace .",
    "the group corresponding to this symmetry is @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the degree of the degeneracy .",
    "when this symmetry group exists , the time evolution of the degenerate electronic subspace picks up a berry phase@xmath129 which contributes to the nuclear force in eq.(45 ) in a fashion identical to that of the nonadiabatic coupling between nondegenerate states .",
    "thus , the equation of motion for the nuclei , eq.(45 ) , is valid irrespective of whether the states in the electronic subspace are degenerate or not .",

    "further , the rate of change of the diagonal elements , @xmath182 is given by @xmath183}\\ ] ] it is clear from this equation and the fact that the nuclear propagation always occurs on a single born - oppenheimer surface , that these equations describe the surface hopping method@xmath4 , for which the fewest switches algorithm is a monte carlo solution .",
    "thus , the fewest switches surface hopping ( fssh ) approach@xmath184 corresponds to a semiclassical approximation to the exact quantum nonadiabatic dynamics , similar to the ehrenfest method described in sec iii.a .",
    "it is also interesting to note that eq.(70 ) can be used instead of eq.(73 ) to generate the surface hopping criterion .",
    "eq.(70 ) provides for a nonzero hopping probability even in regions where transitions are classically forbidden , unlike the usual fssh method .",
    "a similar extension has also been proposed previously by neria and nitzan@xmath185 , on physical grounds through the construction of a semiclassical golden rule .",
    "in addition to this , it is clear from this discussion that semiclassical propagation of the nuclear wavefunction , either using the gaussian form , eq.(65 ) and eq.(66 ) proposed by heller@xmath162 , or by the use of a different basis , lead to generalized schemes for nonadiabatic dynamics that go beyond the mixed quantum classical limit . the use of frozen gaussians within this framework correspond to a scheme for nonadiabatic dynamics that is similar to the multiple spawning method proposed by martinez and co - workers@xmath186 .",
    "the approximation of hops occurring over infinitesimal timescales that is required to derive both eq.(70 ) and eq.(73 ) causes phase changes in the wavefunction due to the hops to be neglected .",
    "furthermore , hops need not occur on infinitesimal timescales , and the quantum nuclear paths which contribute to the dynamics are in general not differentiable , rendering the nuclear velocity to be a poorly defined quantity . in circumstances where such paths contribute significantly to the dynamics surface hopping type methods",
    "will be invalid .",
    "additionally , in the case where two ( or more ) electronic potential energy surfaces become degenerate , the nonadiabatic coupling also picks up nonzero diagonal elements which could act on the dynamics along significant sections of the nuclear path . in such situations ,",
    "an approximate means of treating the dynamics would be to add the diagonal terms in the nonadiabatic coupling to the nuclear hamiltonian and perform the nuclear propagation on each born oppenheimer surface with an additional magnetic force due to the diagonal terms in the nonadiabatic coupling .",
    "the off diagonal nonadiabatic couplings can then still be treated as acting instantaneously to cause hops .",
    "it is likely that such modifications could be of value in improving the accuracy of the fssh method in such situations .    finally , it is useful to discuss the relative utility of the discrete basis path integral presented here versus the coherent state approach that leads to the ehrenfest equations in the previous section .",
    "the natural stationary phase limit of the coherent state path integral is the mean field ehrenfest theory , while the discrete path integral has a corresponding stochastic limit .",
    "these two limits can be thought of as corresponding to two different types of statistics in the hopping events .",
    "the coherent state path integral is a better starting point for approximations when there is significant nonadiabatic coupling between multiple born - oppenheimer surfaces , i.e when hops can occur with high frequency .",
    "in such a situation , a mean field treatment is a good first approximation to the dynamics .",
    "however , the discrete basis approach is better suited to studying the dynamics in the presence of nonadiabatic dynamics between a few levels , and when born oppenheimer surfaces begin to diverge .",
    "in such a situation , the hopping events are relatively infrequent , and nonadiabatic behaviour is sensitive to the detailed structure of neighbouring born - oppenheimer surfaces . the discrete basis approach , for which the surface hopping algorithm is an approximation is a good starting point for approximation in this situation .      the nonadiabatic action eq.(38 ) can be used to describe a semiclassical quantization condition when the system is in a bound state .",
    "this condition is derived in a fashion similar to that used to study the semiclassical quantization of coherent state path integrals@xmath187 , and in quantum field theories@xmath188 .",
    "if an assumption is made that the system executes periodic orbits , then a quantization condition can be written . to derive this quantization condition ,",

    "hence , the poles of the fourier transform of the propagator trace are related to the eigenstates of the combined system in this fashion .",

    "furthermore , if the nonadiabatic transitions couple only a finite set of electronic born - oppenheimer surfaces , this rule may have validity because periodic orbits for the combined nuclear and electronic density matrix variables could exist .",
    "this rule can be written in terms of the total connection factors @xmath206 $ ] for the closed path @xmath207 as @xmath208 = 2\\pi(n + \\frac{1}{2})\\ ] ]    a special case of the born oppenheimer problem , for which the semiclassical quantization rule is useful , is that of a single vibrational coordinate , @xmath209 , coupled to a set of electronic levels .",
    "in this situation , the quantization rule reads @xmath210 in the absence of the nonadiabatic couplings , @xmath211 , the quantization rule gives the exact vibrational energy levels ( assuming that the vibrations are purely harmonic ) .",

    "if an orbit is executed , nonadiabatic transitions between vibrational states can occur , which leads to energy transfer between the oscillator and the electronic system .",
    "this work has presented an exact first principles path integral formulation of quantum nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "the path integral approach developed here has the advantage that it enables computationally tractable stationary phase approximations to the full path integral .",
    "previous path integral based approaches to this problem have stationary phase approximations that lead to nonlocal theories of mixed quantum classical dynamics@xmath8 , or require considering a constrained set of paths for the purposes of approximation@xmath10 .",
    "the method presented here therefore represents an advance over previous approaches in this regard .",
    "a second consequence of this work is that corrections to the quasiclassical nuclear dynamics have been obtained .",
    "these corrections reflect underlying geometric features of the electronic hilbert space .",
    "the corrections so obtained have the advantage that they can be calculated through straightforward extensions of current mixed quantum - classical simulation methodologies .",
    "applications of this approach to study the dynamics of real systems in the presence of conical intersections and other degeneracies in the electronic energy levels are currently being considered .",
    "finally , semiclassical quantization rules have been proposed for nonadiabatic dynamics in the quasiclassical limit .",
    "these rules are potentially of utility in determining approximate energy spectra when the born - oppenheimer approximation is not valid .",
    "a third consequence of this work has been to provide a link between exact quantum theories of nonadiabatic dynamics and semiempirical surface hopping methods .",
    "this work establishes a rigorous theoretical basis for the surface hopping method .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the fewest switches surface hopping approach can be regarded as a generalized stationary phase approximation to the exact quantum dynamics , in complement to the ehrenfest formulation of mixed quantum classical dynamics .",
    "natural extensions of the surface hopping method to include classically forbidden nonadiabatic transitions , as well as the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects through the construction of rigorous multiple spawning type algorithms have been demonstrated .",
    "this work also allows for the construction of semiclassical golden rules to describe nonadiabatic transitions .",
    "the present work also provides a clear perspective on issues concerning equilibrium between the quasiclassical nuclear and quantum , electronic subsystems .",
    "it is clear from the theory presented here that traditional ehrenfest methods do not satisfy equilibrium conditions if only single mean field trajectories are considered .",
    "each such trajectory corresponds to a stationary phase solution for the nonadiabatic propagator at a given set of initial conditions .",
    "however , thermal properties of the system enter through sampling of initial conditions .",
    "hence , if appropriately sampled ensembles of mean field trajectories are chosen , a mixed quantum - classical equilibrium can be established .",
    "correct sampling of mean field trajectories will require an initial sampling of the reduced density matrix for the nuclei and should also correctly account for initial phase correlations according to eq.(26 ) .",
    "it is possible that observed violations of mixed quantum classical equilibrium by the ehrenfest method are due to an incorrect sampling of either of these contributions .",
    "since the surface hopping approximation is obtained by looking at the propagation of the system in each of the states occupied by it , an ensemble averaging of surface hopping trajectories will sample the initial density matrix of the system , and hence this approach and any systematic generalizations based on it can be expected to reproduce the correct mixed quantum classical equilibrium .",
    "this has been demonstrated through a separate set of arguments@xmath212 .",
    "this work provides a different conceptual perspective on the nature of nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "nonadiabatic couplings can be regarded as geometrical objects which are generalizations of berry s geometric phase .",
    "thus , they can be regarded on the same footing as the geometrical phases that arise due to conical intersections@xmath213 .",
    "this similarity between nonadiabatic couplings and geometric phases that arise in degenerate systems has also been noted by previous authors@xmath214 . in principle , the methods described in this work do not differentiate between systems which have degeneracies in energy and those which are nondegenerate .",
    "therefore , the nonadiabatic path integral formulation presented here is of considerable generality and may be of practical utility in computational studies of nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "a potentially useful approach to study exact quantum nonadiabatic dynamics is to consider quantum monte carlo schemes to evaluate the coherent state path integral .",
    "direct applications of quantum monte carlo schemes are likely to face difficulties due to the sign problem .",
    "however , simplifications could be made by using an effective single electron ansatz to replace the matrix elements in the action eq.(26 ) .",
    "such an ansatz could be rigorously constructed by using the runge - gross theorem@xmath215 which relates the exact one electron time dependent density to the expectation value of the electronic hamiltonian in eq.(26 ) .",
    "extensions of the time dependent density functional approach to one electron density matrices can then be used to accurately evaluate the path integral due to the action in eq.(26 ) .",
    "this has the added advantage of naturally incorporating time dependent density functional theory with the nonadiabatic propagation of a quantum system .",
    "this approach will be explored in later work .    although the exact coherent state path integral presented here is a challenge for numerical computation , it is possible to develop numerically more tractable semiclassical propagators that describe the nonadiabatic dynamics as an approximation to the coherent state path integral .",
    "one such approach would involve a stationary phase evaluation of the electronic dynamics ( the ehrenfest equations for the electron density matrix ) , while propagating the nuclear motion using a semiclassical initial value representation .",
    "more promising applications of this work are in developing better approximate methods to describe quantum nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "one potential application is to develop methods which systematically combine ehrenfest and surface hopping type algorithms . to enable this",
    "the propagation of the nuclear dynamics can be divided into sections wherein different basis sets are used depending on physical considerations regarding the nature of nonadiabatic interactions along the nuclear paths .",
    "another natural extension is in refining the surface hopping method to include classically forbidden nonadiabatic transitions by approximating the nuclear wavefunction with a gaussian wavepacket .",
    "alternatively , more general semiclassical propagation schemes can be used to propagate nuclear dynamics in the discrete representation of the path integral .",
    "this would facilitate the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects as well as more accurate treatment of dynamics in the presence of strong nonadiabatic coupling between born - oppenheimer surfaces .",
    "the use of coherent states , and the derivation of the path integral presented here is analogous to path integral treatments of quantum spin systems .",
    "this analogy with quantum spin systems also forms the basis for classical mapping techniques@xmath216 that have been developed to study mixed quantum classical dynamics .",
    "finally , the path integral methods presented here are apparently amenable to perturbative approximations around its stationary phase value .",
    "however difficulties remain due to the nature of the nonadiabatic corrections to born oppenheimer dynamics .",
    "the nonadiabatic coupling between born oppenheimer levels consists of matrix elements of the nuclear momentum operator .",
    "the nuclear momentum operator is unbounded in the hilbert space , and further , the nuclear paths that contribute to the path integral for the system are in general not differentiable .",
    "hence , a perturbation expansion in the nonadiabatic coupling element is not well defined in the path integral framework@xmath92 . in the case of ehrenfest dynamics",
    ", this issue also manifests through the assumptions made in constructing the coherent state path integral .",
    "the assumption made in coherent state path integrals is usually that the paths chosen in the coherent state space are continuous .",
    "this is not valid in general for the problem of nonadiabatic dynamics .",
    "similarly , extensions of surface hopping type methods will need to account for non - differentiable nuclear paths where the nuclear velocity is not defined .",
    "a means of overcoming this problem for the coherent state path integral is to regularize the path integral by considering higher order time derivatives in the action , in analogy to the procedure followed for spin systems@xmath217 .",
    "a perturbative treatment of nonadiabatic dynamics that takes these issues into account is being worked on and will be presented at a later date .",
