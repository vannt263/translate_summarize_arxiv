    "everyone wants to be rich , who does nt ? as a way of investment , stock market provides not only a chance to become a millionaire , but also a direct shortcut to pennilessness . in the present paper we focus on two important properties of the stock trading industry .",
    "first , it is shown that individual households pay a tremendous performance penalty for active trading  @xcite .",
    "even professional fund managers can not outperform the market indices in long term  @xcite .",
    "second , many stock traders can be characterized as chartists , in principle using stock charts solely to make trading decisions  @xcite . inspired by the above two observations",
    ", we will try to make some conclusions regarding the chances of actually beating the market trend by exploiting temporal variations in the stock market .",
    "we will not try to perform a complete modeling of interacting traders , nor will we model all possible trading strategies , but rather learn from a very simple strategy that exploits the fluctuations of stock prices and see whether it can shed any light to the observed difficulties in beating the market trend .",
    "we admit that the trading strategies used in reality could be much more complicated and sophisticated than the naive strategy in this work .",
    "various technical trading strategies based on moving averages , price momentum , channel breaking , and relative stock index have been being used  @xcite . in technical trading ,",
    "suitably defined signals of buying and selling are produced from the past stock price movements , and trading strategies can typically be grouped into two different categories : trend - following and contrarian . the stock trading strategy in this work",
    "is parameterized by only two parameters that will be used for quantifying how fluctuations propagate to the long - term profit of the strategy .",
    "it should be noted that we are not aiming at proposing a profitable trading strategy , but we hope to understand the structure of the profit landscape yielded from a very basic trading strategy of buying and selling .",
    "however , by composing a very simple strategy from elementary buying and selling signals , more complex strategies can be composed from combinations of such signals , and robust features of our strategy , revealed by the profit landscape , should hold also for such , more complex , strategies .",
    "in this work , we use 95 us company stocks ( @xmath3 ) , which existed for 21 years between 1983 and 2004 . the stock price @xmath4 is given for the @xmath5-th stock at time @xmath6 , which is the consecutive integer increasing by one at every trading date .",
    "what we mean by a strategy @xmath7 in this paper is the way of determining ( i ) whether or not to trade ( buy or sell ) , and if it is decided to trade ( ii ) how many units of stocks are to be traded . only for simplicity",
    ", we assume that if ` buy ' decision is made in ( i ) , we buy number of stocks by spending the @xmath8 fraction of cash . likewise ,",
    "if ` sell ' decision is made , @xmath9 fraction of stocks in possession are sold .",
    "accordingly , our imaginary simple portfolio ( we trade stocks for only one company , i.e. , @xmath5 fixed ) is composed of only two accounts ; cash @xmath10 and number @xmath11 of stocks , and the estimated value of the portfolio is given as the sum of the cash and stocks , @xmath12 .",
    "in reality , the amount of cash alone can increase in time by trading the risk - free asset , which is not taken into account in the present study only for the sake of simplicity .",
    "in other words , we assume that the risk - free interest rate is zero . in the same spirit",
    ", we also neglect the increase of cash via dividends provided by companies .",
    "we note that our expression for the value of the portfolio is the same as that of the wealth in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to quantify a strategy with a small set of parameters , we propose the following simple strategy ( we call it @xmath13 ) :    * the trade decision at time @xmath14 depends only on the stock prices at two distinct times @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "more specifically , the log return @xmath16 $ ] is used for the trade decision . * if @xmath17 , one judges that the stock price went up much and thus decides to sell . *",
    "if @xmath18 , the decreased stock price makes the stock attractive to buy , and thus one decides to buy .",
    "we also consider the inverse strategy called @xmath19 :    * if @xmath17 , one expects that the stock price will go up later and decides to buy . * if @xmath18 , one is afraid of further price falling , and thus decides to sell .    in words ,",
    "the strategy @xmath13 can be termed as `` sell - on - rise / buy - on - fall '' , whereas the inverse strategy @xmath19 as `` sell - on - fall / buy - on - rise '' .",
    "similarly , the trend - opposing ( i.e. , contrarian ) and the trend - following strategies have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the meaningfulness of the concept of `` trend '' in real markets is questionable  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we impose the non - negative cash constraint ( @xmath20 )  @xcite and the non - negative stock constraint ( @xmath21 ) . in other words",
    ", you can neither buy stocks if you do not have enough cash , nor you can sell stocks which you do not have ( short selling is not allowed ) .",
    "we also assume that the stock price is given exogenously and that the transaction price of the stock trading equals the daily closure price in the data file .",
    "in general , the strategy in the present setup can be written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . for given values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath25 ,",
    "we investigate the performance of the investment strategy parameterized by the two variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the detailed algorithm of performing our investment game is as follows : ( i ) we pick a company @xmath5 one by one .",
    "( ii ) at the first trading date , we start from one million dollars @xmath26 .",
    "( iii ) for given values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we keep applying the strategy repeatedly till the last date @xmath27 .",
    "( iv ) we evaluate the performance of strategy by computing the profit defined by @xmath28/m(0)]$ ] . for each stock trading",
    ", we also assume that we pay small trading fee @xmath29 . in the real stock market , there often exits minimum number of stocks to be traded .",
    "we have compared 1 , 10 , and 100 as minimum trading volume , only to find insignificant change of results .",
    "henceforth , our strategies allow the trade of a single unit of stocks ( but you can not sell or buy a fraction of a stock ) .",
    "we first compute the profit @xmath30 of historic stock data for the @xmath5-th company , in the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath31 defined on unit square @xmath32\\times[0,1]$ ] .",
    "for convenience , we discretize the parameter space into an @xmath33 square grid and compute @xmath34 values of @xmath30 at the center of each small square of the size @xmath35 . once those values are computed , one can easily find the global maximum of the profit @xmath36 for the given resolution @xmath37 , and call those optimal values as @xmath38 .",
    "we also calculate the number @xmath39 of local maxima which satisfy the criterion that four neighboring points in square grid have smaller values of the profit than at the center . as an example , we run the simulations at @xmath34 ( @xmath40 ) grid points for @xmath41 and then use the obtained optimal value @xmath42 to construct fig .  [",
    "fig : xttrade ] , where we also denote time instants when the buy and the sell decisions are made .",
    "whether or not short term fluctuations in the stock market may be exploited is addressed by benchmarking our strategies with a `` buy - and - hold '' strategy @xmath43 ( see table  [ tab : strategy ] ) : at @xmath44 all cash is spent to buy stocks and the profit is evaluated at @xmath45 , given by @xmath46/x(1)$ ] . the value of @xmath47 changes from company to company , depending on the growth rate of each firm . the growth rate conditioned to the firm size",
    "has been known to have exponential distribution function  @xcite , while the size of each firm is power - law distributed  @xcite . for a company shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xttrade ] , @xmath48 , which is smaller than the maximum profit realizable by the strategies @xmath13 and @xmath19 .",
    "the actual profit of any strategy for historic data is however of marginal interest ; more interesting issue to pursue is what we can learn from the profit landscape and see if it allows us to make money in the future .",
    "we next study how the number @xmath39 of local maxima of the profit landscape defined on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane changes as the resolution parameter @xmath37 is increased .",
    "if the profit landscape has a simple structure that there are only a few number of peaks , @xmath39 is expected to first increase with @xmath37 , since the number of peaks found in the higher resolution ( larger @xmath37 ) will be larger than that in the lower resolution ( smaller @xmath37 ) . in this case of a simple landscape , @xmath39 will then soon saturate to an @xmath49 value , and will not increase any more even when @xmath37 is increased further .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the optimization process we described above can be very efficient to locate the global maximum profit .",
    "if the maxima are uniformly distributed they will scale linearly with the number of boxes @xmath50 , that is @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fractal]a we show how @xmath39 ( averaged over 95 usa stocks ) changes as a function of @xmath37 for different strategies .",
    "the scaling falls between the two extremes : surprisingly , @xmath39 increases with @xmath37 following an algebraic form of @xmath52 for both strategies . although not reported here , we find that the behavior @xmath53 with @xmath54 for broad range of parameter values of @xmath55 , and @xmath25 , both for @xmath13 and @xmath19 .",
    "the same value of @xmath56 is found when extended range @xmath57 \\times [ 0,2]$ ] is used , and when eight neighbors of square grid ( instead of four nearest neighbors ) are compared for the determination of local maxima .",
    "furthermore , korean stock price data also reveal the same behavior with @xmath54 ( to be reported elsewhere ) .",
    "these observations clearly indicate that the pattern of how local maxima are scattered in the two - dimensional parameter space is described by a _ fractal _",
    "structure .",
    "we next compare our findings to the standard model of stock price , i.e. , geometric brownian motion ( gbm )  @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the brownian random variable and @xmath60 is the wiener process .",
    "the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are fitted to each of the stocks and a number of replicas are simulated over the same period of the real stock data .",
    "a striking difference to the real stock price data is that for the gbm local maxima are evenly distributed , seen by the scaling @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fractal]b .",
    "a conclusion we can make from this is that the profit can not be explained solely from the first and the second order statistical moments ( the mean value and variance ) but a more detailed description of stock price movement is needed .",
    "it is well known that gbm is not able to describe some stylized facts of real price movements such as high value of kurtosis , fat tails in the probability distributions of log - returns , and the stochastic volatility and its clustering behavior  @xcite . beyond gbm various stochastic processes",
    "have been proposed with lvy processes as the most prominent example .",
    "various models as subclasses of lvy processes and autoregressive models have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the results from more sophisticated models of financial - time series are however not further corroborated here .",
    "although all the strategies belonging to @xmath13 and @xmath19 have qualitatively the same fractal structure in their profit landscapes , the maximum profit realizable by a given strategy is very different from each other . in general",
    ", the average maximum profits of @xmath13 are found to be larger than those of @xmath19 .",
    "this can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : xttrade]b and c : in @xmath13 sell prices are often higher than the buy price , while the opposite is seen for @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , contrarian strategies have been shown to yield higher profits than trend - following ones in @xcite .",
    "we also observe that for given values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the average maximum profit does not significantly depend on the value of @xmath25 .",
    "this is not a surprising observation since it is well known that the autocorrelation of returns decays very fast ( in several minutes )  @xcite , and thus the time difference @xmath25 larger than one day will not make much difference in the results .",
    "we have seen that there exist fluctuation based strategies for which the maximum profits significantly exceed the profit from the long term buy - and - hold strategy @xmath43 .",
    "the question is how to find the optimal strategy , since we need to estimate @xmath0 and @xmath1 for future stock data by using past stock data . even if we possibly can not find the _ optimal _",
    "strategy by optimizing for old data we would like to know whether we can be sure to find a _ good _ strategy from such an optimization process .",
    "the fractal profit landscape suggests that the optimization process is very sensitive to perturbations , such as missing data and the change of optimization period of time .",
    "we study the stability of the optimized strategies in two different ways : first , we compare how the profit changes across different companies for given values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "more specifically , we obtain the optimized values @xmath63 and @xmath64 for each company @xmath5 , and use the average values @xmath65 and @xmath66 to compute the profit by the strategy @xmath67 applied for each company @xmath5 , which gives us the average profit @xmath68 .",
    "second , we compare how the profit changes in different time periods as follows : we use the first half period ( @xmath69 ) for optimization of the strategy , and then use the obtained values @xmath63 and @xmath64 to compute the profit for the second half period ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "these two ways to test the stability of the optimized strategy can be phrased as the tests for spatial stability ( across stocks @xmath5 ) and for temporal stability ( across the time @xmath14 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : performance ] summarizes the results from the stability tests of the optimized strategy .",
    "it is again shown that the optimized strategy for each individual company for the whole period yields better profit than that from the buy - and - hold strategy , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "since each stock has different time evolution behavior , the optimized values @xmath63 and @xmath64 are different for different companies . in this regard",
    ", it makes some sense to use @xmath72 and @xmath73 for all the companies , expecting that these values could have somehow better performance , although not as good as @xmath74 .",
    "the third box denoted as @xmath75 in fig .",
    "[ fig : performance ] clearly shows that the use of the average values @xmath72 and @xmath73 does not give us better profit than the buy - and - hold strategy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : performance ] , we also display the result from the temporal stability test , denoted as @xmath76 .",
    "it shows that the use of the optimized strategy for later time periods dramatically reduces the profit value .",
    "the same conclusion is reached when we use finer time windows as follows : we divide the whole time period @xmath27 into 20 time intervals and obtain the optimized value @xmath77 and @xmath78 at each @xmath79-th interval ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we then use @xmath77 and @xmath78 to compute @xmath81 at later time interval @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "even the largest value of the profit [ @xmath84 is found to be smaller than the profit from the buy - and - hold strategy at the same interval .",
    "this indicates that our conclusion of the temporal instability of the optimal strategy holds at least for sufficiently long time scales .",
    "the results from the stability tests can be summarized as follows : even though fluctuations , theoretically , may be exploited in our basic trading scheme , the @xmath85-parameters ( i ) can not be estimated from historic data and ( ii ) nor can they be estimated from other stocks . in both cases",
    "the performance is significantly worse than the buy - and - hold strategy .",
    "our results agree with other existing studies : it is now generally believed that stock market has become more efficient and most technical trading strategies based on daily price changes stopped being profitable in mature market  @xcite , although developing markets can still be different  @xcite .",
    "we next investigate the actual shapes of the profit landscapes in terms of the observations made above .",
    "figure  [ fig : landscape ] displays ( a ) @xmath86)$ ] and ( b ) @xmath87)$ ] for one stock ( @xmath5 ) , and ( c ) @xmath88)$ ] for other stock ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "one can see that the shape of the landscape looks quite different from each other , supporting the above conclusion of the instability of optimal strategy .",
    "it is also seen that the profit landscape is quite rugged in accordance with the fractal - like distribution of the local maxima reported in the present study . for comparison",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape]d the profit landscape for the gbm series .",
    "the difference of the fractal dimension for local maxima between real stock prices and gbm is not clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape ] , however , the landscape for ( d ) gbm looks more rugged than the landscape for ( a ) an actual stock .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the profit landscape defined by a set of simple investment strategies .",
    "we have shown that the local maxima in the profit landscape are scattered like a fractal and that the global profit maximum increases very slowly as the search resolution in the parameter space is increased .",
    "these findings imply that a local search in a strategy space to get the highest profit is almost impossible .",
    "we believe that our conclusions of poor performances of fluctuation - based trading strategies and their fractal profit landscapes are related with the unavoidable lack of future information of a company . if one has full information of the stock price change for the future , that information can directly be used to optimize trading strategy",
    ". however , if the future information is not sufficiently accurate , it can be basically useless in increasing profit , as has already been shown in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we plan to study the rugged profit landscape in the present work in comparison with the fitness landscapes in other research areas  @xcite .",
