    "1989 ) have mapped the entire nebula in the two co lines j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 ; the morphology of the molecular gas follows very closely that of the ionized gas , showing a clumpy , inhomogeneous torus , tilted with respect to the line of sight by about 56@xmath14 , which is expanding outward . scaled to our adopted distance @xmath15 pc ,",
    "the torus has a radius of @xmath160.05 pc , and mass @xmath16 0.26 m@xmath6 , much larger than the mass of ionized gas ( @xmath160.01 m@xmath6 , walsh 1983 ) .",
    "the radial velocity of the most intense co condensations is of the order of 1535 km s@xmath17 , which results in a dynamical age of about 2500 yr ( but see also walsh et al .",

    "kastner et al . (",
    "1994 ) surveyed a sample of bipolar planetary nebulae ( including ngc  2346 ) ; they conclude that the h@xmath0  emission very likely originates in thermally excited ( possibly shocked ) molecular gas . recently ,",
    "natta & hollenbach ( 1998 ; hereafter nh98 ) have computed theoretical models of the evolution of pn shells and predicted , among others , the intensity of the most commonly observed h@xmath0  vibrationally excited lines ( namely , the 1 - 0s(1 ) at 2.12 @xmath18 m  and the 2 - 1s(1 ) at 2.25@xmath18 m ) .",
    "they consider the emission of the photodissociation region ( pdr ) formed by the uv photons emitted by the central star impinging on the shell , including in the calculations time - dependent h@xmath0  chemistry and the effects of the soft x - ray radiation emitted by the central star , which are important in sources like ngc  2346 where t@xmath9@xmath19 k. nh98 compute also the emission of the shocked gas at the interface between the shell and the wind ejected by the central star in its previous red giant phase .",
    "they point out that both mechanisms ( pdr and shocks ) can produce lines of similar intensity , with reasonable values of the model parameters .",
    "the pn properties that determine the intensity of the h@xmath0  lines are very different in the two cases . as discussed in nh98 ,",
    "if the emission is produced in the warm , neutral pdr gas , the line intensity depends mostly on the stellar radiation field which reaches the shell and , to a lower degree , on the density of the neutral gas itself .",
    "if the emission is produced in the shocked gas , then the line intensity does not depend directly on the properties of the central star or of the pn shell , but only on the shock velocity and on the rate of mass - loss of the precursor red - giant .",
    "it is therefore clear that , before attributing any diagnostic capability to the h@xmath0  lines , we need to understand which of the possible excitation mechanisms dominate the pn emission .",
    "this paper is a first attempt to understand the h@xmath0  emission of a well - studied pn in a quantitative way , i.e. , by comparing the observations to detailed models of pdr and shock emission , such as those discussed in nh98 . to this purpose ,",

    "one problem that arises immediately with these models has to do with the estimated luminosity of the central star . at @xmath47 yr",
    ", a core of 0.7 m@xmath6  has already reached the white dwarf cooling track ; it has a luminosity of about 250 l@xmath6 , an effective temperature",
    "t@xmath9@xmath48 k and a number of ionizing photons @xmath49@xmath50 photons s@xmath17 ( blcker 1995 ) .",
    "while the effective temperature is roughly in agreement with the zanstra heii temperature ( mndez 1978 ) , the luminosity is significantly larger than the values 1790 l@xmath6  quoted in the literature .",
    "however , we are somewhat suspicious of those very low values .",
    "the luminosity derived from the heii @xmath514685  intensity by mndez ( 1978 ) is a lower limit l@xmath9@xmath3143 l@xmath6(for @xmath52=800 pc ) and is very sensitive to the extinction .",
    "the number of ionizing photons we derive from the observed radio flux at 6 cm ( 86 mjy ; milne and aller 1975 ) and from the total h@xmath1 flux ( walsh 1983 ) is at least @xmath53 photons s@xmath17 ( assuming no escape of ionizing photons and an average optical depth in h@xmath54 ) , consistent with l@xmath9@xmath16250 l@xmath6 , but not with lower values of l@xmath9(see fig .  3 of nh98 ) .",
    "if l@xmath9=250 l@xmath6 , the non - detection of the white dwarf star in the visual is not surprising ; assuming , for simplicity , that the a star and the white dwarf spectrum can be represented by black - bodies at 8500 k and @xmath55k , having luminosities of 15 and 250 l@xmath6 , respectively , we find that the white dwarf is a factor 54 weaker than the a - type star at 5500  , a factor of 10 at 3000  and that the two stars become comparable only at @xmath162000 .",
    "this last is consistent with the uv excess ( with respect to the flux expected for the a star ) measured by the ultraviolet satellite ans and reported by mndez ( 1978 ) .",
    "all together , we suspect that the white dwarf luminosity is roughly of the order of 250 l@xmath6 . in any case",
    ", we have also computed a model where we have artificially reduced the stellar luminosity by a factor 5 at all times ; the density of this model ( model 5 ) , shown as a dashed curve in fig .",

    "a value l@xmath9=50 l@xmath6  ( although not predicted by any evolutionary track ) is still roughly consistent with the observed line intensity , especially if we consider the uncertainty on the pn age estimate .",
    "however , this model predicts an intensity lower than observed ( by a factor 310 ) for all the h@xmath0  lines we measured .",
    "the best fit to the h@xmath0  1 - 0s(1 ) observations is provided by models with low density ( @xmath57 @xmath3 ) , in good agreement with the low electron density ( @xmath58 @xmath3 ) derived for the ionized part of the nebula ( liu et al .",
    "1995 ; mckenna & keenan 1996 ) .",
    "assuming pressure equilibrium between the ionized and the neutral gas , and a pdr temperature @xmath16500 k , we expect a neutral density about 40 times the electron density .",

    "if the h@xmath0  lines are emitted in the pdr , we expect to observe a similar morphology in the ionized and h@xmath0emitting gas . in ngc  2346 ,",
    "the pdr origin of the h@xmath0  lines is supported by the fact that the same morphology is seen in h@xmath0  and in h@xmath1 ( see walsh 1983 ) . also , we detect br@xmath27  emission in the two h@xmath0  peaks , with a n - s profile that follows that of the 1 - 0s(1 ) line ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cuts ] ) .",
    "the intensity of br@xmath27  predicted by the models is very low , of the order of @xmath84 erg @xmath29 s@xmath17 sr@xmath17 , comparable to the observed values ( 46@xmath85 erg @xmath29 s@xmath17 sr@xmath17 ) .",
    "this supports our estimate of l@xmath9 .    in principle , the observed intensity of the h@xmath0  1 - 0s(1 ) line can also be accounted for by the emission of the shocked gas produced by the expansion of the torus inside a precursor red - giant wind . however , we estimate ( following nh98 ) that one needs a rather high value of the mass - loss rate in the red - giant wind ( @xmath86 m@xmath6 yr@xmath17 ) . this , in turn , implies a high density of the pre - shock gas ( @xmath87 @xmath3 ) , which is not supported by any existing observation .",
    "in fact , as discussed by zuckerman and gatley ( 1988 ) , the main difficulty in ascribing the h@xmath0  vibrationally excited emission to shocks comes from the high momentum rate these models require .",
    "many authors ( see the review by kwok 1993 ) have proposed that the formation and expansion of the pn shell ( or torus ) is related to the action of the fast wind from the central star . in this case , the ambient gas ( pre - shock red giant wind ) gains momentum approximately at the rate at which momentum is delivered to the torus by the fast wind . since the fast wind is radiation driven , this rate ( @xmath88 ) must be @xmath89l@xmath9/@xmath90 . in ngc  2346",
    ", we estimate that @xmath88 is at least @xmath91 erg cm@xmath17 s@xmath93 , i.e. , more than 600 times the present value of l@xmath9/@xmath90 ( for l@xmath9=250 l@xmath6 ) and 12 times higher than the maximum l@xmath9/c reached by the star in its earlier evolution , according to the evolutionary tracks of blcker ( 1995 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the h@xmath0  emission in terms of shocks is often justified in the literature by the low measured ratio of the 2 - 1s(1 ) to the 1 - 0s(1 ) intensity .",
    "this argument , however , is not very strong , since in dense pdrs the low vibrational h@xmath0  levels are thermalized .",
    "the pdr models discussed in  4.1 predict a ratio 2 - 1s(1)/1 - 0s(1)@xmath160.15 ( not very different from the 0.10 - 0.18 range predicted by shock models ; see  4.2 ) , independently of the density and stellar luminosity .",
    "these values are somewhat higher than the observed ratio ( @xmath160.07 ) .",
    "it is possible , and worth further investigations , that models tend to overestimate the fluorescent component of high vibrational lines , possibly because of uncertainties in the collisional deexcitation rates .",
    "an interesting result of our observations , and one that we can not account for with our simple models , is the variation of the 2 - 1s(1)/1 - 0s(1 ) ratio with position along the slits , ranging from about 0.08 to 0.15 along the w slit , and from 0.08 to 0.23 along the e slit ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cuts ] ) .",
    "these variations are not monotonic with the distance from the peaks , but show evidence of structures , especially along the w slit .",
    "it is possible that this is due to density variations , which affect the fluorescent contribution to the 2 - 1s(1 ) line .",
    "if the emission is due to shocks , this could trace variations in the propagation velocity of the shock in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "further support to the pdr origin of the h@xmath0  emission can be obtained by observing lines from higher vibrational states .",
    "we show in table 3 pdr model - predicted values for lines not detected so far in ngc  2346 , which , however , are accessible from space .",
    "the lines are very weak with respect to the 1 - 0s(1 ) , with ratios that do not depend significantly on the density .",
    "we expect that they will be substantially weaker in shocks . to complete the discussion of the h@xmath0  spectrum , we show in table 4 model - predicted values of the intensity of mid - infrared lines in the v=0 - 0 band for four of the pdr models described in  4.1 .",
    "these lines have been observed by iso in a number of pne ( among them ngc  2346 ; barlow et al . in preparation ) , and may be useful diagnostic of the physical conditions ( see nh98 )",
    ".    0.1 cm    0.1 cm",
    "this paper is motivated by our interest in understanding the origin of the h@xmath0  emission in pne .",
    "recently , natta & hollenbach ( 1998 ) have computed the evolution with time of the h@xmath0  emission expected in pne of different core mass and shell ( or torus ) properties .",
    "their models compute the emission originating in the photodissociation region ( pdr ) created by the uv radiation of the central core incident on the inner edge of the neutral shell , as well as the emission in the shock associated to the expansion of the torus inside the precursor red - giant wind .",
    "nh98 show that both regions can produce intense h@xmath0  emission and that detailed studies of individual pne are necessary .",
    "ngc  2346 is a good candidate .",
    "it is a bright , young pn , with a typical butterfly morphology characterised by well developed bipolar lobes of emission and a bright torus around the central star .",
    "the same morphology is seen in h@xmath1 , co and in the h@xmath0  1 - 0s(1 ) line .",
    "there is a large amount of information in the literature , concerning the properties of the ionized region and the gas kinematic that can be used in our analysis .",
    "we have collected near infrared observations of ngc  2346 .",
    "the data include broad k band image , an image in the h@xmath0  vibrationally excited 1 - 0s(1 ) line and slit spectra in the k band in three positions in the nebula .",
    "the images confirm the well - known ngc  2346 morphology , with a central , bright torus , surrounded by weaker emission with a typical butterfly shape .",
    "the k band spectra show 11 h@xmath0  lines with excitation energies from 6150 to 12552 k. profiles of the lines intensity along the slit show evidence of secondary condensations outside the torus midplane .",
    "a comparison of our observations with the nh98 models shows that pdr emission can account for the h@xmath0  observations .",
    "this requires a low - density shell ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) , in agreement with the low density measured in the ionized region .",
    "note that steady - state models or models where the soft x - ray radiation from the star is ignored predict a 1 - 0s(1 ) intensity one order of magnitude lower than models where both these effects are included .",
    "pdr models of the h@xmath0  emission needs a central star significantly more luminous than estimated in the literature ( 250 l@xmath6  against 1790 l@xmath6 ) .",
    "however , we think that this is consistent with all the available data , including our own br@xmath27  observations .    it is unlikely that the h@xmath0  emission originates in the shock between the expanding shell and the precursor red giant wind .",
    "shock models require a much larger momentum input to the torus than possible from the central star .",
    "we estimate the discrepancy to be at least a factor 600 for the current luminosity of the central star ( taken to be 250 l@xmath6 ) and a factor 12 if we consider the maximum luminosity ever reached by the star in its previous evolution .    in conclusion",
    ", we have proved that the pdr origin for the h@xmath0emission in ngc  2346 is likely and that the models , even if very simple , can account for a number of the observed properties .",
    "we suggest some additional observations of lines from higher excitation vibrational levels and in the 0 - 0 band , which may help in determining the physical conditions in the shell with higher accuracy .",
    "we thank leonardo vanzi for his help during observations , sandro gennari and the longsp / tirgo staff for their help in this project .",
