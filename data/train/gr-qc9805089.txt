    "after almost one century of relativity , many pre - relativistic prejudices ( baconian  idola  ) still survive .",
    "one of the most tenacious is the idea that , after giving up newton s absolute space and absolute time ( the 3 + 1 absolute splitting ) , every observer ( or  reference frame  ) possesses in any case its own private space and its own private time , i.e. its private _ extended _ 3 + 1",
    "however , it should be known from the general theory of relativity that this can be true only for the class of the _ extended reference frames defined by a congruence _ @xmath0 _  of timelike worldlines , living in general riemannian space - times , for which the  vortex tensor ",
    "@xcite vanishes_. let us point out that this class includes the important subclass of the _ extended inertial frames _ _ living in minkowskian space - times _ ( space - times with vanishing riemann tensor ) .    as a consequence , in any reference frame for which the vortex tensor differs from zero",
    ", the concept of  the whole physical space at a given instant  turns out to be conventional , in the sense that it is lacking an operational meaning because of the impossibility of a symmetrical _ and transitive _ synchronization procedure at large .    in this paper , we shall deal with a very interesting case , where the naive assumption of the existence of a  physical space  in a reference frame for which the vortex tensor is different from zero leads to paradoxical results .",
    "this is the case , widely studied in the literature but often plagued by serious misunderstandings , of a disk uniformly rotating in a minkowskian space - time .",
    "this problem has been treated by various authors with different approaches ( the difference being essentially in the definition of space and time on the disk ) , all of them ( with only a few exceptions , like cantoni @xcite , anandan@xcite and mashhoon@xcite ) sharing a crucial point which , as we shall see , contains a fundamental element of ambiguity : _ the circumference of the disk is treated as a geometrically well defined entity , that possesses a well defined length _ without worrying about the fact that no transitive synchronism exists along the said circumference .",
    "further on they diverge : ( i ) on the measure of such a length ; ( ii ) on the time unit used to evaluate the velocity of ( massive or massless ) particles in uniform motion along the said circumference ( we do not consider here other essentially derived topics , such as for instance the space metric on the disk ) .    to fix ideas ,",
    "let @xmath1 be an inertial frame , and @xmath2a rigid circular platform rotating with constant angular velocity @xmath3 with respect to @xmath1 ( in the following , all quantities valued in @xmath4 will be indicated by the suffix @xmath5 ; all quantities valued in @xmath1 will be indicated without any suffix ) .",
    "almost all authors consider two circumferences : ( i ) the rim of the platform , as seen in @xmath4 ; ( ii ) the set of the positions of the points of the rim in @xmath1 ; and assume that these circumferences are geometrically ( of course not kinematically ) identical . let @xmath6 , @xmath7 , be the lengths of the radii of the two circumferences , as seen in @xmath4 , @xmath1 respectively ; @xmath8 , @xmath9 the lengths of the circumferences ; @xmath10 an interval of proper time of a clock @xmath11 at rest on the rim , and @xmath12 the corresponding interval of time in @xmath1 , as measured by two different clocks at rest in @xmath1 , and there synchronized .",
    "the relationships between the above quantities have the very general form    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are generic functions of the peripheral velocity @xmath17 ( which of course is assumed to be lower than @xmath18 ) and possibly of the centrifugal acceleration @xmath19 ( although the dependence from the acceleration is not expected , in the standard theory of relativity ) .    according to the special theory of relativity ( srt ) , all authors agree about @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 :    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the assumptions ( [ fl0 ] ) , ( [ fl1 ] ) , ( [ fl2 ] ) come from the consideration that : ( i ) the lorentz contraction acts only on the periphery and not on the radius of the disk ; ( ii ) any clock @xmath11 at rest on the rim of the disk undergoes the lorentz dilation of time intervals , as measured in @xmath1",
    ".    however , not all authors agree about the numerical value of the ratios @xmath24 and @xmath25 . as a matter of fact , two different assumptions are found in the literature :    @xmath26    @xmath27    the assumption ( [ ratio1 ] ) - see for instance @xcite and references therein - comes from the consideration that , since the proper length @xmath28 of an infinitesimal element of the rotating circumference does not change when the disk passes from rest to rotation ( all proper quantities are invariant ) , _ the same should happen for the entire circumference : this gives _",
    "@xmath29 _ , which is interpreted as the proper length of the circumference .",
    "_ a puzzling , but unavoidable , consequence is the following : the ratio @xmath25 , as measured in @xmath30 , is less than @xmath31 , thus violating the euclidean geometry of @xmath1 ( remember that @xmath1 is an inertial frame ! ) .",
    "this is the well known ehrenfest paradox @xcite .",
    "the only way to maintain the euclidean geometry of @xmath1 , when @xmath32 _ , _ consists in introducing a further ad hoc hypothesis , and precisely the hypothesis that the surface of the disk bends , in a suitable way , because of the rotation .",
    "if such ad hoc hypothesis is rejected , on the basis both of kinematical and dynamical considerations _ on a purely kinematical basis_. ] , the ehrenfest paradox can not be solved ,  from a purely kinematic point of view ",
    ": this is the conclusion of cavalleri @xcite , who ends up with the statement that  the relativistic kinematics for extended bodies is not generally self - consistent  ( and suggests an  intrinsically dynamical  solution of the paradox such as the one invoked by dieks@xcite ) .",
    "the assumption ( [ ratio2 ] ) comes from the consideration that the edge @xmath33of the platform , as seen in @xmath4 , and the set @xmath34 of the positions of the points of such edge in @xmath1 , _ are two circumferences geometrically _ (",
    "although of course not kinematically ) _ identical_. moreover : ( i ) the circumference @xmath34 , as seen in @xmath1 , must have the length @xmath35 , according to the euclidean geometry of @xmath1 ; ( ii ) since the circumference @xmath36 , as seen in @xmath4 , is not changed , but the unit ( infinitesimal ) rod is changed by a factor @xmath37 ( lorentz contraction ) , then the length of the circumference @xmath38 , as measured in @xmath1 , turns out to be increased by a factor of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore @xmath39 : which shows that the geometry of the rotating disk is not euclidean .",
    "this is the most widespread assumption ( see for instance einstein @xcite , arzelis @xcite , landau and lifshitz @xcite , mller @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "we are not going to comment further on these topics , but simply remark that the widespread and apparently innocent assumption that the length of a round trip along the border of the rotating disk coincides with that of a univocally defined geometric object , unavoidably leads to the paradox pointed out by selleri @xcite whose case we shall summarize in the next section .",
    "a great many authors did not realize this fact .",
    "we shall show that a correct and thorough application of the special theory of relativity dissipates any ambiguity , by giving up the prejudice of the unicity of the length of a round trip about the axis of a rotating turntable .",
    "recently , an interesting paper by selleri @xcite shows that :    \\a ) _ under the only _",
    "( apparently obvious and , as a matter of fact , universally shared )",
    "_  assumption that a round trip corresponds to a geometrically well defined entity , whose equally well defined length be _",
    "@xmath40 ( about its measure any hypothesis is anyhow avoided ) _ ; _",
    "\\b ) _ independently of any of the particular assumptions mentioned in the introduction ; _",
    "\\c ) _ more generally , independently of any particular choice about the functions _ @xmath15 _ and",
    "_ @xmath16 _ ; _    _ an unavoidable paradox actually arises in the standard special relativity theory applied to rotating platforms_.    selleri considers a light source @xmath41 placed in a fixed position near the clock @xmath11 at rest on the rim of the rotating disk , and two light flashes leaving @xmath41 in opposite directions at the ( proper ) time @xmath42of @xmath11 , grazing a cylindrical mirror on the rim .",
    "the counter - rotating and the co - rotating light signals come back to @xmath41 respectively at the ( proper ) times @xmath43and @xmath44 of @xmath45 ( these times are different because the light signals , as seen in the inertial frame @xmath1 , travel with the same velocity @xmath18 along two paths which are different because of the rotation of the disk ) . on the other hand , according to the previous assumption , the two paths should be identical , with the same length @xmath8 , in the frame @xmath2of the disk . then the velocities @xmath46 , @xmath47 of the counter - rotating and co - rotating light signals , as seen in @xmath4 , should be different :    @xmath48    ( since @xmath4 is not an inertial frame ,  there is no reason to demand that the speed of light be the same eastward and westward@xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath49 , @xmath47 are expressed in terms of kinematical quantities on @xmath1 , the functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 appear .",
    "but if the ratio @xmath50 is considered , _ the functions _",
    "@xmath15 _ , _ @xmath16 _  disappear _ , and the final result    @xmath51    ( @xmath52 ) is obtained .",
    "now , if we consider the class of rotating disks having the same peripheral velocity @xmath53 and arbitrary centrifugal acceleration @xmath54 , the observable quantity @xmath55 given by expression ( [ ro ] ) is constant for increasing radius ( @xmath56 ) and decreasing acceleration ( @xmath57 ) . here the paradox arises .",
    "in fact , uniform motion at any speed whatsoever may be thought of as the limit of the motion on the rim of a disk of infinite radius and infinitesimal acceleration ; this means that , in the limit case of null acceleration , the neighborhood of the light source @xmath41 on the disk should be indistinguishable from an inertial frame . as a consequence , such a neighborhood should be related to @xmath1 by a standard lorentz transformation , and the ratio @xmath55 between the speeds of the forward and backward moving light rays should be exactly 1 .",
    "selleri concludes that srt gives rise to a discontinuity in the function @xmath58 for @xmath57 , and claims that such a discontinuity is inadmissible  because our empirical knowledge about inertial systems was actually obtained in frames with small but non zero acceleration , e.g. because of earth rotation  .",
    "since the calculations of selleri are quite careful , the paradox can not be avoided until the assumption ( a ) , which states that the round trip on the turntable corresponds to a well defined circumference whose length is univocally defined , is maintained .",
    "of course , this paradox is lethal for the self - consistency of the srt ; as a consequence , selleri suggests that the srt should be abandoned and that the isotropy of the speed of light exists in only one privileged reference frame , according to an idea he already proposed elsewhere @xcite .    once again , let us stress that , according to proposition ( b ) , eq .",
    "( [ ro ] ) does not depend on the particular choice of the functions @xmath15 and _  _ @xmath59 _ ; _ that s why _  _ eq . ( [ ro ] )",
    "coincides with the classical result , corresponding to the galilean velocity composition rule ( which can be obtained assuming @xmath60 _  _ @xmath61 ) .    _",
    "remark : the anisotropy of the light velocity and the  hypothesis of locality  .",
    "_    _  _ selleri stresses that eq .",
    "( [ ro ] )  does not only give the ratio of the two global light velocities for a full trip around the platform in the two opposite directions , but also the local ratio as well  . _  _ this is consistent with the assumed symmetries of the disk , in particular with the assumption of homogeneity of space along the rim ; but conflicts with the  hypothesis of locality ",
    "@xcite,@xcite , according to which the speed of light , as measured _  locally _ by means of standard rods and clocks at rest in @xmath2 ( in an infinitesimal neighborhood of the light source @xmath41 ) should be exactly the same as that observed in the local inertial frame , the latter being @xmath18 in both directions .",
    "_ remark : eq.([ro ] ) in some previous relativistic approaches .",
    "_    _  _ eq .",
    "( [ ro ] ) has actually been obtained by many authors in apparently relativistic contexts .",
    "landau and lifshitz @xcite ,   89 , and some other authors - more or less explicitly : see e.g. arzelis @xcite , ",
    "115 - derived formulas equivalent to ( [ ro ] ) at first order in @xmath62 .",
    "the underlying idea is that , since no transitive synchronization procedure exists for the turntable in motion , the best time to be introduced on the disk is not the ( proper ) time measured by real clocks on it , but the time of the inertial frame @xmath1 ( sometimes called  universal time  @xcite or , more appropriately ,  central time",
    " @xcite ) . from an operational point of view",
    ", this definition of time means that any clock on the disk should not show its proper time , but the time of the clock of @xmath1 over which it happens to be located at a given instant .. ] this way the simultaneity criterium in @xmath63 is borrowed from @xmath1 . as a consequence : ( i ) the spatial section of the reference frame of the disk is the ( euclidean ) 2-plane @xmath64 ; ( ii ) the coordinate transformations between @xmath1 and @xmath63 take on the following galilean - type form : @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the cylindrical coordinates @xmath68 and @xmath69 in @xmath70 respectively .",
    "since the total round trip times for co - rotating and counter - rotating light signals are not the same , _ but the length of the two round trips in _ @xmath71 _  is assumed to be the same ( as being related to a univocally defined geometric object ) _ , the velocity of light should be different for the two patterns , and eq .",
    "( [ ro ] ) follows .",
    "such a velocity seems to be considered by landau and lifshitz @xcite as a physical quantity , because the physical time @xmath10 of @xmath4 differs from the  universal time",
    " @xmath12 of @xmath1 only for terms of second order in @xmath62 .",
    "the same result ( [ ro ] ) is obtained by peres @xcite in the full srt , under the same underlying assumptions .",
    "it is unclear whether the velocity of light is just a coordinate velocity without a physical meaning , or is actually physical : in this case it is tacitly assumed @xmath60 _  _",
    "@xmath72 , and the relativistic approach is only apparent .    anyway , the point we would stress is that , _ in any case _ , every ( classical or  relativistic  ) approach , based on the hypothesis that the length of a round trip is related to a univocally defined geometric object , unavoidably leads to eq .",

    "the classical explanation ( see for instance sagnac @xcite ) , but also many  relativistic  explanations ( e.g. peres @xcite ) , ascribe such a time difference to the anisotropy of light propagation along the rim of the platform , due to rotation .",
    "on the other hand , the true relativistic explanation , proposed by anandan @xcite in 1981 and here recovered , with many interesting implications , ascribes such a time difference to the nonuniformity of time on the rotating platform , and in particular to the  time lag  arising in synchronizing clocks along the rim ( see next section ) .",
    "in order to compare the speed of the light beams as seen on board the platform , the lengths of the different travels are needed . to this end , consider a given event taking place on the rim of the platform , e.g. the event  emission of two photons in opposite directions from the source @xmath107  .",

    "in 4 dimensions everything is clear and clean , but we perceive the world locally in 3 + 1 dimensions ; so the results found in the previous sections could be considered as being rather abstract requiring the knowledge and application of four - dimensional geometry and setting aside what appears to be a most  natural  splitting between space and time . the question can legitimately be posed whether the same general result could be found on the base of actual measurements performed on the disk .    in the present section ,",

    "the clocks are synchronized in one and the same place , that will be assumed to be the origin of the observer s reference frame .",
    "now the observer sets out for an extremely slow ( negligible relative velocity ) round trip on the platform in a sense which for us is corotating , carrying with him the rods and one of the clocks . at each step",
    "he lays down one rod , tail to head of the previous one .",
    "when he comes back to the origin the number of rods he used tells him what reasonably he considers as being the length @xmath166 of his trip .",
    "there is however a curious phenomenon our experimenter can notice : when coming back to the origin , the clock carried with him turns out to be desynchronized with respect to the identical one he left at the origin , and precisely turns out to be _ late _ by a given amount @xmath167 , whose numerical value is given by eq .",
    "( [ timelag ] ) .",
    "if our observer repeats his slow trip in the reverse sense , he will find : ( i ) the same length @xmath166 of his new trip , since the number of rods is one and the same both turning clockwise and counterclockwise ; ( ii ) the same desynchronization of his clock , which this time turns out to be _",
    "ahead _ by the same amount @xmath167 with respect to the identical one at the origin .",
    "if he compares the results of the two trips , he finds a net desynchronization @xmath168  between the two travelling clocks , after their clockwise and counterclockwise slow round trips .    to solve this puzzling result",
    ", our experimenter decides to send light beams in both directions along the same path he followed and measures the time they take to reach the origin again , finding two different results @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the most interesting thing is that _ the difference _",
    "@xmath171 _  _",
    "@xmath170 _  exactly equals the net desynchronization _",
    "@xmath172 _  between the two ( slowly ) travelling clocks ! _ excited by this astounding coincidence , our friend decides to send pairs of material objects ( particles or matter waves ) in opposite directions , with the same relative velocity .",
    "he finds of course different times of the total round trips , but the same difference between them for any pair of travelling objects : @xmath172 again and again !",
    "so our experimenter , although completely unaware of any theoretical approach to the problem , in particular of any four - dimensional geometrical model of space - time , and only confident in his own measurements realized by means of real rods and real clocks , is forced to conclude that : ( i ) the platform on which he lives is rotating , and the desynchronization @xmath172 of a pair of clocks , after their slow round trips in opposite directions , is a measure of the speed of this rotation ; ( ii ) the time intervals along the closed path are not uniquely defined and , to obtain reliable measures of them , the readings of clocks must be corrected by a quantity @xmath173 to account for the desynchronization effect ( by the way , this is precisely what is done when considering data from the gps satellites @xcite ) ; ( iii ) as a consequence of this correction , the speed of light is actually the same both forward and backward .",
    "it is interesting to note that our pure experimenter discovers the interdependence between space and time , although unaware of the metric structure of minkowski space - time - or , what is the same - of srt .    to sum up",
    ", we see that different approaches are possible about space and time , however once one has been chosen about space ( time ) , the properties of time ( space ) are entirely determined by the theory and produce in any case the same result .",
    "different pictures are available but the statements about physical quantities and their relationships are finally the same .",
    "\\(1 ) according with our pure experimenter , the circumference of the rotating disk can be considered as a geometrically well defined entity , with a well defined length in the reference frame of the disk .",
    "but in this case , when considering durations involving displacements along the rim ( i.e. through points where time flows differently ) , _ a correction is unavoidable _ _ in order to take into account the phenomenon of desynchronization_. this is the price to be payed if consistent results are desired .",
    "\\(2 ) according to our four - dimensional treatment , the synchronization along the rim is defined by extending formally the local einstein criterium of simultaneity .",
    "then the length of the circumference of the rotating disk , as measured by infinitesimal rigid rods at rest along the rim , turns out to be an open curve in space - time , and its length turns out to be traveller - dependent",
    ".    one can choose description ( 1 ) , which is closer to real measurements on the platform , or description ( 2 ) , which is clearer and , at least in our opinion , quite enlightening ; but the conclusions about physical quantities are exactly the same .",
    "the choice of the description is a matter of taste ; the statements about physical quantities and their relationships are a matter of fact and self - consistency .",
    "the starting point of this paper was a careful check of eq .",
    "( [ ro ] ) .",
    "we easily found that that formula , widespread both in non - relativistic and in relativistic literature , and apparently supported by the experimental evidence of the sagnac effect , actually leads to the paradoxical consequences pointed out by selleri @xcite .",
    "in particular , eq . ( [ ro ] ) turns out to be incompatible both with the principle of invariance of the speed of light in the class of the inertial frames and with the  hypothesis of locality  . as a consequence , eq .",
    "( [ ro ] ) would rule out all the relativistic physics of this century and imply the existence of a privileged (  absolute  ) frame , which could be interpreted as the frame of the stationary ether .",
    "we are not going to comment further on some unexpected and radical implications , first of all the recovery of absolute simultaneity ; see sagnac @xcite for a galilean - like interpretation , and selleri @xcite , @xcite for a lorentzian - like interpretation .",
    "actually we have shown that eq.([ro ] ) comes from the ( explicit or implicit ) assumption that the length of round trip journeys along the rim of a turntable is that of a closed curve ( namely a circumference ) and is unique for all travellers independently from the kind of synchronization procedure adopted .",
    "this assumption , evident in eq.([c ] ) , where the same length @xmath174 is used for both the counter - rotating and the co - rotating light signals ( as seen in @xmath63 ) , comes from a purely three - dimensional approach ( global @xmath175 splitting ) .",
    "however if we look at relativity from a 4-dimensional ( in this case @xmath80 dimensional is enough ) point of view , one sees that  round trips ",
    "correspond in general to open curves ( arcs of helixes ) and their proper lengths differ from one traveller to another , in particular for co - rotating and counter - rotating light beams ( the starting point @xmath176 is univocally defined , but the end point @xmath177 depends on @xmath178 , as can be seen on figure 2 ) .",
    "when the speed of the traveller tends to zero ( in any direction ) the length of the journey tends to the unique value @xmath179 given by eq.([lo ] ) , which has usually been considered as the length of the  circumference ",
    "@xmath180 defined in ( [ gamma00 ] ) .",
    "the root of the misunderstandings lies in the ambiguity of a self - consistent definition of simultaneity ( in @xmath63 ) of events taking place along the rim of the disk , in particular in the drastic change of the topology of the line of simultaneous events , due to rotation , which is evident in a four - dimensional context only . on this very",
    "fact ( namely in the time lag of eq.([timelag ] ) ) stands the correct relativistic explanation of the sagnac effect , which does not need any anisotropy of the speed of light along the rim , contrary to a widely supported idea .    in order to formally recover , in that context , the isotropy of the speed of light",
    ", peres is forced to introduce an ad hoc time that has nothing to do with the time of real clocks on the turntable @xcite .",
    "our result , in a full minkowskian context , is that the speed of light is actually the same both  eastward and westward ",
    "( to use peres words ) , as measured using real clocks at rest on the platform .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the srt has no flaws when applied to describe the behaviour of light as seen from a turntable carrying mirrors , provided we avoid the use of ( geometrical or kinematical ) quantities _ ambiguously defined _ , and stick consistently to its axioms and rules ."
