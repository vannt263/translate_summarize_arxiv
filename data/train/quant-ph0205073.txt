    "the production of maximally entangled state of photons at distance is a key issue in communications of quantum information , for distributed quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation@xcite , and quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the detrimental effect of losses is a serious problem for establishing entangled resources at distance , since any kind of non - classical state is very sensitive to the effect of loss .",
    "if one needs to teleport @xmath0 qubits from alice to bob , @xmath0 ebits need to be shared between them , and for such purpose photons are the only practically available carriers .",
    "one can use equivalently either @xmath0 single ebit with the qubit encoded on polarization , or a single continuous variable entangled stateemode-with qubits encoded on the photon number .",
    "parametric downconversion allows to create both kinds of entangled states , ebits and emodes , in the low and high gain regimes , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we compare ebits and emodes in the presence of loss .",
    "in contrast to the case of a single emode , a scheme based on ebits with the qubit encoded on the polarization of single photons has the obvious advantage that the successful achievement of the ebit is automatically checked by the presence of the photon itself at both alice and bob sites , whereas for a single emode , this is not possible , due its vacuum component . while there is no viable method for testing the presence of the emode without destroying the entanglement ,",
    "a scheme for purification of emodes in the presence of loss has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , with the disadvantage of achieving a maximally entangled state of a random set of modes , hence with the need of changing the encoding / decoding procedure each time , depending on which are the entangled modes .",
    "therefore , in the presence of loss only the ebit allows _",
    "knowingly _ successful teleportation / communication without increasing the complexity of the protocol versus @xmath0 .",
    "since emodes are more sensitive to loss for increasingly large number of photons , a way out for implementing emodes in the presence of moderate losses is to produce weakly entangled modes , then performing a locc operation to enhance the entanglement at the output of the lossy channel : this is the only viable method for designing a protocol based on ebits with low probability of failure .    in this paper",
    "we will compare the efficiency of ebits and emodes in establishing @xmath0 maximally entangled ebits , by considering a protocol for emodes in which weakly entangled states are prepared and an optimal locc operation is performed after the loss in order to obtain a @xmath1 maximally entangled state .",
    "as we will see , the ebits are largely superiors to emodes in all cases .",
    "our task is to create @xmath0 ebits shared at distance between alice and bob in the presence of loss . @xmath0",
    "ebits are represented by @xmath0 copies of a maximally entangled state belonging to the tensor - product @xmath2 of two - dimensional hilbert spaces , or equivalently by a single maximally entangled state in @xmath3 . to achieve this task we consider the use of @xmath0 ebits and the use of a single emode , with qubits encoded on photon polarization and photon number , respectively .",
    "first we consider the use of @xmath0 single - photon states @xmath4 denote alice and bob sites .",
    "the effect of loss on a single - mode state @xmath5 is described by a completely positive map that can be written in the kraus form @xcite @xmath6&\\doteq & \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } v_n \\rho v^\\dag_n\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 the physical parameter @xmath8 plays the role of the energy attenuation factor , since on has @xmath9a^\\dag",
    "a]=\\eta \\mbox{tr}[\\rho a^\\dag a]$ ] .",
    "the smaller is the value of @xmath8 , the larger is the effect of the loss .",
    "more generally , @xmath8 gives the scaling factor of any normal - ordered operator function , namely @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the dual map , which is defined through the identity @xmath12 \\rho \\right ] = \\mbox{tr}\\left [ o { \\cal l}[\\rho ] \\right ]   \\ ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] valid for any operator @xmath13 .",
    "the typical best achievable value of the loss in a optical fibers is of order @xmath14 .",
    "hence for two parties @xmath15 far apart the loss is @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "each mode is affected by the effect of loss , hence from the maximally entangled state ( [ psi ] ) one obtains the mixture @xmath18=\\eta |\\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi |+(1-\\eta ) |0\\rangle _ a { } _ a\\langle 0 |\\otimes    the probability of sharing @xmath0 maximally entangled ebits in the presence of loss is given by @xmath19 .",
    "now we consider the second scheme , based on a single emode ( `` twin - beam '' ) @xmath20 when producing the state ( [ tb ] ) by parametric down - conversion , the value of parameter @xmath21 is related to the gain @xmath22 of the optical amplifier as @xmath23 .",
    "typically , one has @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the state ( [ tb ] ) is the entangled resource for the continuous variable teleportation of ref .",
    "@xcite . in a way analogous to eq .",
    "( [ mix ] ) , the twin - beam state that has suffered the effect of loss becomes a mixture , and here we are interested only in the component that is still a twin - beam , which is given by @xmath25 we rewrite the state eq .",
    "( [ tb ] ) damaged by the loss as follows @xmath26=q\\,|\\chi ( \\eta ^{1/2}\\lambda ) \\rangle\\langle \\chi ( \\eta ^{1/2}\\lambda ) | + \\sigma   \\;,\\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a positive operator with @xmath29=1-q$ ] .",
    "the value @xmath30 gives the probability that the twin - beam state survives the loss , a part from the gain rescaling @xmath31 .",
    "our task is now to achieve the maximally entangled state @xmath32 for this purpose we perform a locc transformation on the state @xmath33 . from vidal",
    "s theorem @xcite , we know that the maximal probability @xmath34 of obtaining the state @xmath35 from @xmath36 by means of a locc is given in terms of the schmidt coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the states by @xmath39 in our case one has @xmath40}\\frac{m ( \\eta |\\lambda |^2)^{i}}{m - i } \\leq m ( \\eta |\\lambda |^2)^{(m-1)}\\equiv p ' \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , one can easily show that for @xmath41 one has @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the overall probability @xmath43 of obtaining the maximally entangled state @xmath35 using a twin - beam @xmath44 in the presence of loss by means of an optimal locc transformation is given by latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } p_c = q \\,p^*=\\frac { 1- |\\lambda |^2}{1-\\eta |\\lambda    @xmath0 ebits versus a single emode one takes @xmath46 for the state ( [ m ] ) and compares the probabilities @xmath47 ( ebits ) with @xmath43 ( emodes ) . some numerical results",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the probabilities @xmath47 ( circles ) and @xmath43 ( triangles ) are reported for different values of @xmath48 and @xmath21 .",
    "the comparison is dramatic : qubits are much more efficient than emodes for any realistic value of the gain parameter @xmath21 and loss @xmath8 .",
    "= .35 = .35    = .35 = .35    the much greater efficiency of ebits versus emodes can be inspected analytically as follows .",
    "we define the ratio @xmath49 and we have the chain of inequalities @xmath50 from eq .",
    "( [ rat ] ) it is clear that @xmath51 implies @xmath52 , namely the scheme based on @xmath0 ebits is more efficient than that based on a single emode .",
    "the ratio @xmath53 writes as @xmath54    the expression of @xmath53 shows that for sufficiently large @xmath0 one has @xmath55 , and the use of @xmath0 ebits becomes rapidly much more efficient than using a single emode .",
    "in addition , we want to emphasize again that in the presence of loss only the ebit allows _ knowingly _ successful teleportation / communication without increasing the complexity of the protocol versus @xmath0 .",
    "we have considered the problem of obtaining maximally entangled photon states at distance in the presence of loss , and compared the efficiency in establishing @xmath0 shared ebits by using @xmath0 single ebit states  with the qubit encoded on polarization  and a single continuous variable entangled state ( which we called `` emode '' ) assisted by an optimal locc protocol in order to obtain a @xmath1-dimensional maximally entangled state , with qubits encoded on the photon number .",
    "we have shown the dramatic superiority of @xmath0 ebits versus a single emode , besides the fact that only the ebit allows _",
    "knowingly _ successful teleportation / communication . we have not considered the possibility of purification schemes for emodes .",
    "however , we emphasize again that the only proposed scheme @xcite has the disadvantage of achieving a maximally entangled state of a random set of modes , with the need of encoding / decoding procedures whose complexity is increasing versus @xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that a fruitful use of twin beams in quantum information technology at distance completely relies on the possibility of practical purification schemes , which need to be properly designed in a way which is suitable to the particular entanglement - based protocol of interest .",
