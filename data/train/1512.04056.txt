    "active processes giving rise to non - equilibrium fluctuations are ubiquitous in biological systems .",
    "this is notably distinct from the incessant motion exhibited by particles in any fluid known as brownian motion which results from the constant collision of the particle with its surrounding solvent molecules @xcite .",
    "however in biological systems active motion are driven by the chemical energy produced from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) .",
    "for instance the motion of cytoskeleton inside the cells is controlled by the motor proteins which involves atp hydrolysis @xcite .",
    "other examples would be cell membranes which are perpetually out of equilibrium through active processes @xcite and swimming bacteria which control the active transport of nutrients in aqueous medium @xcite . in a very new study",
    "it has been shown that the dynamics of dna is also influenced by the processes dependent on the energy derived from atp hydrolysis @xcite .",
    "a series of simulation studies have also been performed to investigate the looping dynamics in active system .",
    "et al _ have recently shown that in presence of self - propelled particles the loop formation in polymer become faster due to increased diffusion @xcite . in another study",
    "it has been found that looping is also faster when the polymer itself is active , having a catalytic monomer .",
    "this catalytic monomer generates a concentration gradient prompting faster diffusion of the non - catalytic monomer resulting in rapid ring - closure @xcite .",
    "such studies are extremely important as loop formation in biopolymers is an essential process in protein folding , dna replication etc .",
    "experimentally there have been many attempts to study the dynamics of unfolded proteins mainly involving long - range f@xmath0rster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) @xcite . in this particular technique two residues of a protein are labelled with a donor and an acceptor using fluorescence probes to study the fluctuation of the distance between them ( fig .",
    "this distance is temporally correlated with a characteristic decay time , referred as reconfiguration time ( @xmath1 ) which is determined by fitting the long time decay of the second order intensity correlation function @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no such experimental study has been performed till date which will provide insights into the reconfiguration dynamics of a chain in an active medium . in this paper",
    "we theoretically analyze the dynamics of a single chain polymer in presence of active noise . by active noise",
    "we refer to a long - ranged temporal noise where the time correlation is independent of ambient temperature . in contrary to the recent simulation studies we find such long temporally correlated noise to result in a slower reconfiguration of a polymer chain , be it flexible or semi - flexible . even in the presence of non - local hydrodynamics interactions in addition to the active noise , reconfiguration of the chain",
    "is slower .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section @xmath2",

    "for an one - dimensional brownian particle , moving in a harmonic trap , the dynamics in the over - damped regime is best described by the langevin equation @xcite    @xmath6    where , @xmath7 is the force constant and @xmath8 is the gaussian random force with first and second moments    @xmath9    here the strength of the correlation depends on the ambient temperature @xmath10 .",
    "now when the system is subjected to an active noise of strength @xmath11 the equation of motion becomes @xcite ,    @xmath12    here , @xmath11 is considered to be exponentially correlated with a characteristic decay time @xmath13 and gaussian distribution with moments    @xmath14    importantly @xmath15 , the strength of the active noise is independent of @xmath10 and can be related to probability of active force ( @xmath16 ) and the force @xmath11 acting on the particle as f @xmath17 .",
    "being independent of ambient temperature @xmath10 the active noise drives the system off the equilibrium and only in the infinite time limit a stationary state can be realized . in between , the system remains in a non - equilibrium state .",
    "such a choice of noise correlation comes from earlier simulation studies on red - blood cell membrane fluctuations , where the force @xmath18 originates from the non - equilibrium fluctuations of the motor proteins @xcite .",
    "the position correlation function @xmath19 with the active noise is analytically trackable and has the following expression .",
    "readers are referred to the appendix for the detailed derivation .",
    "@xmath20    in the absence of active noise , @xmath21 , the above expression is reduced to    @xmath22    this is the time correlation function for an over - damped brownian particle in harmonic potential in the presence of only thermal noise or the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and @xmath23 is the corresponding relaxation time @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrpart ] ) that although the correlation function is translationally invariant , it is not single exponential .",
    "however , this can be approximated as a single exponential with an effective relaxation time @xmath24 ,    @xmath25    with ,    @xmath26 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + @xmath24 is bound from the above and below with @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the limit , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , in other extreme @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , as @xmath33 , the correlation decay also become slower with @xmath32 and in the absence of noise when @xmath21 , @xmath30 .",
    "other than @xmath24 another parameter is @xmath34 that defines the effective correlation function @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is related to the ambient temperature as follows , @xmath37 .",
    "+ thus , @xmath38 defines a renormalized thermal energy , but only in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "this directly follows from the mean square displacement ( msd ) of the particle .",
    "@xmath40    this msd grows with time @xmath41 and saturates as expected due to confinement . however , the initial growth of msd is faster in presence of active noise ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "a detailed derivation of msd is presented in the appendix .",
    "this model can be further extended to describe a many - body system such as a flexible or a semi - flexible polymer as long as the chain is assumed to have a gaussian distribution .",
    "rouse model is the simplest yet widely used model to describe a polymer with gaussian statistics devoid of any hydrodynamics and excluded volume interaction .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath43 monomer is given by @xcite    @xmath44    where , @xmath45 is the position of the @xmath43 monomer at time @xmath41 and @xmath46 can vary from @xmath47 to @xmath48 for a polymer with @xmath49 monomers .",

    "@xmath55    it is a very standard procedure to decouple the equation of motion of the monomers using normal modes having independent motions as follows , @xmath56 and as long as the noises @xmath57 and @xmath58 are uncorrelated eq .

    "( [ eq : rouse - mode ] ) ) is structurally the same as that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : langevinact ] ) , the only difference being it is for the @xmath62 mode of a chain .",
    "it is obvious that each mode of the chain behaves as an over - damped brownian particle in the presence of the active noise trapped in a harmonic well .",
    "when pre - averaged hydrodynamic interactions are considered under @xmath69 condition , the normal modes of the polymer behave very similarly as that of a rouse chain and have the same structure @xcite    @xmath70    with @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the semi - flexible polymer is modeled as kratky - porod wormlike chain which is unstretchable and includes the effect of bending energy @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for a semi - flexible chain without incorporating the effects from hydrodynamic interactions is given by    @xmath75    in normal mode description semi - flexible chain is similar to a flexible chain except @xmath76 which has a fourth order dependence on the mode number @xmath77 unlike flexible chain .",
    "@xmath78    where , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , bending rigidity is related to the persistence length @xmath81 of the polymer as follows @xmath82 .",
    "however , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the time - correlation function for the normal modes has a very general structure for the flexible as well as the semi - flexible chain and it remains the same even when the hydrodynamic interactions are incorporated .",
    "the form of the expression is very similar to that of a single over - damped brownian particle moving in a harmonic well in the presence of active noise    @xmath85    to find the exact expression for the flexible , semi - flexible or the zimm chain one just need to select the exact forms of @xmath76 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 for a rouse chain , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 for a zimm chain and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 for a semi - flexible chain .    the time correlation function for the vector ( @xmath94 ) connecting the @xmath95 and the @xmath96 monomer can easily be calculated from the above expression , which is the summation over the correlation functions of all normal modes describing the polymer .",
    "@xmath97    the reconfiguration time ( @xmath1 ) corresponding to the fluctuation of the distance between the end - to - end monomers is theoretically calculated by taking a time integration of the corresponding normalized correlation function ( @xmath98 ) @xcite    @xmath99    where , @xmath100    similarly , the expression of the msd of the vector ( @xmath94 ) can also be derived from the msd of the normal modes @xcite .",
    "this is again similar to that of a single particle . in a recent study , ghosh _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated how msd of a semi - flexible chain grows in presence of such active noise .",
    "higher the strength of the active noise , faster the growth .",
    "in fig . ( [ fig : a ] ) we show the normalized correlation function for rouse chain in presence and absence of active noise which is calculated using the generalized expression given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrgen ] ) .",
    "the parameters are chosen in consistence with the real values such as @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 which is in agreement with the viscosity of water . as mentioned earlier",
    "@xmath15 is the strength of the active noise and @xmath107 .",
    "it has been experimentally observed that in biological systems motor proteins like myosin , kinesin exert force in the @xmath108 range @xcite . for our calculations",
    "we have considered @xmath109 and @xmath110 . for a fixed value of @xmath15",
    "we have chosen two different values of @xmath13 , such as @xmath111 and @xmath112 which are in the same order of magnitude of @xmath113 . from the plot",
    "it can be seen that correlation decay is always slower in presence of an active noise even when the characteristic decay time of the active noise @xmath13 is very small and as @xmath13 increases the decay of @xmath114 becomes even slower .",
    "however , this correlation loss has very weak dependence on the strength of the active noise @xmath15 .",
    "changing the strength practically brings no difference in the correlation function . the log - log plot of reconfiguration time against chain length ( @xmath48 )",
    "is shown in fig ( [ fig : b ] ) where the reconfiguration time is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : recon ] ) and as expected , reconfiguration time increases as the temporal correlation loss of the active noise becomes slower . for",
    ", a @xmath115 monomer chain @xmath1 increases @xmath116 times in the presence of active noise when @xmath117 , whereas it becomes @xmath118 times higher when the decay time of active noise @xmath119 .",
    "but , surprisingly the chain length dependence remains unchanged even in the presence of active noise . in all three cases @xmath120 where , @xmath121 .",
    "it is well known that the reconfiguration time is a summation of the relaxation times of each mode i.e. @xmath122 , which has the analytically exact expression    @xmath123 \\label{eq : recon_gen}\\ ] ]    where , the @xmath48 dependence comes through @xmath124 , @xmath86 and @xmath76 .",
    "a careful analysis of the preceding expression shows that if the active noise strength @xmath15 is very small i.e. @xmath21 , the above expression reduces to @xmath125 and since , @xmath126 , the dependence of the reconfiguration time is also identical .",
    "now what happens if @xmath15 becomes very large i.e. @xmath33 , @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is a constant . even in this case the @xmath48 dependence comes only from @xmath87 and @xmath129 . in between these two extreme cases",

    "the plot of normalized time - correlation function against time is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : c ] ) which shows a similar trend as that of rouse chain , i.e. the correlation loss becomes slower whenever active noise is introduced to the system .",
    "next , the chain length dependence of the reconfiguration time is determined for the zimm chain from fig .",
    "( [ fig : d ] ) , and it is found to be @xmath130 which is in agreement to the previous work done by chakrabarti @xcite . in this case also the chain - length dependence of reconfiguration time does not differ in the presence of active noise .",

    "( [ fig : e ] ) shows the normalized time correlation function of the end - to - end vector for a semi - flexible chain . here",
    "also the behavior of the correlation loss in presence of active noise is identical to rouse and zimm chain .",
    "the kuhn length for semi - flexible has been considered to be @xmath131 .",
    "this is roughly the kuhn length of dna which has a series of different kuhn length depending upon the solvent condition @xcite .",
    "the persistence length of the semi - flexible chain has been considered to be half of the kuhn length during the calculations .",
    "when chain length dependence of semi - flexible chain is determined it is found to be @xmath132 .",
    "this might seem surprising since @xmath93 has a fourth order dependence on @xmath48 in addition to the usual second order dependence , for which the dependence on chain length should be higher than that of rouse model .",
    "if we take a look at the expression for @xmath93 , since the value of @xmath80 considered in the calculations is very small the contribution from @xmath133 is negligibly small and that is the reason even for semi - flexible chain the @xmath129 .     vs @xmath41 for semi - flexible chain , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    ) vs chain length ( @xmath48 ) for semi - flexible chain , scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "in this work we have looked into the effect of active noise in chain reconfiguration for a flexible polymer where the active noise is modelled with a long temporally correlated non - equilibrium force .",
    "it can be clearly seen that in the presence of active noise the chain reconfiguration becomes slower .",
    "however slowing down of the reconfiguration dynamics seems to be controlled by the correlation time @xmath13 rather than the strength of the correlation .",
    "thus in a typical fret like experiment , measurement of reconfiguration time of a protein should show slowing down in an environment with active noise .",
    "similar behaviors are also observed when pre - averaged hydrodynamic interaction is considered . for a worm - like semi - flexible chain",

    ", where a long temporal noise acts on the chain , fret type measurement would show the chain to retain the correlation for longer time than in absence of such noise .",
    "since the thermal and the active noise are uncorrelated , they come separately as a summation in the correlation function and the position correlation function for the thermal noise has standard solution which is not shown here ,      the position correlation function for the time correlation function of the active noise involves a modulus of time , therefore the integration is split in two parts .",
