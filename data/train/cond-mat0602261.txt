    "while early studies of electron transport through mesoscopic systems such as quantum dots or molecular systems concentrated on the current  @xcite , more recent activities , both experimental  @xcite and theoretical   @xcite , include the analysis of shot noise .",
    "the latter provides additional insight into the quantum transport properties  @xcite and allows a more detailed characterization of the quantum transport device .    for ` local ' systems , such as single ( multilevel ) quantum dots , above the sequential tunneling threshold the shot noise power",
    "@xmath0 is typically sub - poissonian , implying that the fano factor @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mean current , is less than unity .",
    "if the level couplings are asymmetric , e.g. in the presence of magnetically polarized electrodes , the noise can become super - poissonian . in this case",
    "the fano factor takes values larger than unity  @xcite .",
    "very recently it was found that enhanced noise can also be found in symmetric systems inside the coulomb blockade region where the current is much suppressed  @xcite . on the other hand , for non - local systems , such as serially coupled quantum dots , due to their complex internal level structure , super - poissonian noise can develop even in fully symmetric situations and above the sequential tunneling threshold  @xcite .",
    "these non - local systems exhibit a pronounced and sensitive dependence of their transport characteristics on internal parameters and couplings .    in this article",
    "we study sequential transport in a system of two strongly coupled quantum dots .",
    "specifically , we consider a double quantum dot ( dqd ) in series in which the left dot is coupled weakly to left electrode and similarly the right dot to the right electrode , while the two dots are coupled strongly via electron tunneling , and they also interact electrostatically via the coulomb interaction ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) . our results ( in section  [ sec : results ] )",
    "address two distinct issues :    \\(i ) in section  [ subsec : symm ] we study the shot noise of the symmetrically coupled dqd in the coulomb blockade regime , generalizing the work of ref .  .",
    "co - tunneling processes are assumed to be weak , hence transport is due only to thermally activated processes .",
    "we find that in the coulomb blockade regime the relation between two energy scales , the sequential tunneling energy @xmath3 and the difference of the first excitation energy and the ground state ( which is also the inelastic cotunneling energy ) @xmath4 , determines the occurrence or absence of super - poissonian noise .",
    "this part of our analysis is valid generally for weakly coupled system in the coulomb blockade regime , for any value of the gate voltage , as it depends only on generic properties of the internal electronic structure of the interacting dot system .",
    "\\(ii ) above the sequential tunneling threshold , for the weakly coupled dqd super - poissonian noise can only appear if the left @xmath5 right symmetry is broken . for a non - local system like the dqd this symmetry breaking can be achieved in two qualitative different ways : ( a ) the symmetry of the electrode - dot couplings is broken , while the dqd is unchanged , see section [ subsec : asymm_coup ] . here",
    ", the step positions in the current and noise characteristics are not influenced by the asymmetry .",
    "but for sufficient asymmetry in the coupling negative differential conductance ( ndc ) appears , i.e. the current decreases with increasing bias , while at even stronger asymmetry additionally super - poissonian noise appears .",
    "( b ) the symmetry of the electrode - dot couplings is preserved , while the symmetry of the dqd - hamiltonian is broken by detuning the dot level energies , see section [ subsec : asymm_level ] . here , the step positions in the current and noise characteristics differ for different degrees of detuning .",
    "the dqd eigenfunctions become spatially non - uniform which breaks the parity symmetry of the effective coupling of the various eigenstates to the electrodes .",
    "this , in turn , leads again to ndc and eventually with further detuning to super - poissonian noise .    as such asymmetries",
    "are easily detected in an experiment , we can learn more about the underlying asymmetries of the couplings , electronic structure and also the total spin of the states participating in transport . in the available measurements setups on dqds of various groups  @xcite metallic finger gates",
    "allow for controlled manipulation of the relevant parameters , e.g the electrostatic potential of the individual dots as well as the inter - dot and dot - electrode couplings . while it might be difficult to unambiguously distinguish the two cases of symmetry breaking",
    ", our predictions should still be verifiable in shot noise measurements in available systems",
    ". we also comment and compare our results to related theoretical work  @xcite on similar systems in section  [ subsec : comparison ] .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "the occupation of the states participating in transport at the plateaus is highly sensitive to the asymmetric couplings .",
    "let us consider the first plateaus ( positive and negative bias ) of the current in the case @xmath144 . for negative bias , in contrast to the symmetric case where the ground state g and the bonding state b are equally occupied , we have now a higher probability to be in the state g than in the state b. this is due to the fact that it is `` easy '' to populate the dqd from the right but `` difficult '' to depopulate the dqd in direction of the left electrode because of the suppressed coupling . as a consequence",
    "the system is occupied by two electrons most of the time .",
    "the reverse holds for positive bias , where the dot is most often occupied by one electron and consequently the probability to be in the state b on the first plateau is higher than to be in the ground state g.    to obtain the current @xmath2 we need to consider the relevant current rates @xmath145 in addition to the probabilities of the various states . on the first plateaus , the relevant current rates @xmath146 from ground state to bonding state(s ) ( with given spin @xmath147 ) at negative bias are equal in magnitude to the reverse rates @xmath148 at positive bias ( independent of the spin @xmath147 of @xmath149 ) .",

    "the combination of the same relevant current rate but different occupations leads to a higher ( absolute ) value of the current on the first plateau at negative bias than on the corresponding plateau at positive bias . to be concrete , if we consider the currents on the left interface of the dqd we have at negative bias a current with absolute value @xmath152 which is almost twice as large ( for @xmath144 ) than the current @xmath153 going through the left interface at positive bias",
    "here , the factors of two originate from the spin summation over the bonding state doublet .    on the first plateau the fano factor is monotonically increasing for positive bias with decreasing @xmath154 until it would reach the poissonian value @xmath155 for very large asymmetry , resembling the noise of an effective single barrier . for negative bias on the first plateau , the fano factor ( given by eq .",
    "[ eq : fano ] ) is not monotonic : it first decreases until it reaches @xmath156 for @xmath157 , then it increases until it also would reach the poissonian value for large asymmetry .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior reflects the interplay of asymmetry and different spin multiplicity of the relevant states g and b.    at the second plateau the transition from the bonding state b to the first excited triplet state t ( @xmath76 ) becomes possible and thus provides a second current channel .",
    "the stationary probabilities are redistributed in the following way : for negative bias , the states g and each of the three triplet states @xmath158 have approximately equal occupation ( within 10 percent ) . as a consequence of the threefold spin multiplicity of the triplet the probability of the ground state decreases to less than one third of its value on the first plateau .",
    "the bonding state b also loses some of its ( already small ) probability to the competing triplet states .",
    "the tunneling processes from the triplet state(s ) t to the bonding state(s ) b contribute an additional current via the current rates @xmath159 ( per triplet state and spin of b ) .",
    "however , even when summing over all the triplet contributions the resulting current is too small to compensate the loss from the processes involving the ground state",
    ". therefore a region of negative differential conductance ( ndc ) appears as soon as the triplet states play a role in transport for negative bias ( at the considered coupling asymmetry ) .",
    "the ndc is accompanied by a ( relatively ) enhanced noise because the competing processes involving the ground state and the triplets have sufficiently unequal rates @xmath160 and @xmath159 to form slow and fast transport channels .",
    "this competition leads to the super - poissonian fano factor as depicted in fig .",

    "stronger detuning @xmath161 leads to ndc and eventually super - poissonian noise .",
    "in contrast to fig.[fig : asymmetric ] , the bias ( energy ) positions of current and noise features are changed due to the modified dot hamiltonian.,width=321 ]    for positive bias on the second plateau the situation is quite different . here",
    ", the dqd remains mostly in the bonding state b , i.e. there is no major loss of occupation for the bonding state ( about 10 percent ) .",
    "again the current leaving the dot consists of two additive contributions .",
    "in addition to the ground state contribution already present on the first plateau , the transitions between bonding to the triplet states add a large contribution and thus the current increases stepwise to a second , higher plateau .",
    "the above illustrates that although for one bias direction ( here positive ) the current and shot noise show generic behavior ( and the fano factor is always sub - poissonian ) , the situation can be quite different for the reverse bias . as such asymmetries",
    "are easily verified in an experiment , we can learn much about the underlying asymmetries of the couplings and the spin multiplicities of the states participating in transport .",
    "note that the ndc and super - poissonian noise would completely disappear if we would take the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath162 . due to a finite @xmath20",
    "the singlet ground state can benefit from local singlets , i.e. states with two electrons of opposite spin on the same dot , whereas there is no equivalent for triplet states .",
    "therefore , the singlet ground state has a lower energy and different transitions rates as compared to the triplet states , both of which are necessary conditions for the ndc and super - poissonian noise in the considered single - level model .",
    "the discussion above serves as a basis to qualitatively understand transport in the more complicated situation when the symmetry of the dqd hamiltonian itself is broken , rather than merely its coupling to the electrodes . in the following , we detune the level energies @xmath163 and also vary the inter - dot hopping @xmath17 while the other parameters of the dot system remain the same and the couplings remain symmetric , @xmath164 . for an experiment ,",
    "this implies a gate electrode for each dot that can be controlled separately .",

    "if we start detuning the levels , i.e. @xmath167 we change our excitation energies and the states become more localized on the dot with lower energy ( here the right dot ) .",
    "consequently , we find the current and fano factor plateaus at different ( energy ) positions as before , with different length of the plateaus .",
    "note that the current on the first plateau only weakly changed for all @xmath161 considered here .",
    "this is due to the fact that despite of the changed hamiltonian , the tunneling rates from ground state to bonding state as well as the occupations of these states are almost the same .",
    "the occupations on the first plateau are also only weakly dependent on the sign of the bias , quite different to the situation with asymmetric couplings considered above . only with an even stronger level detuning",
    "would the current be significantly changed on the first plateau .",

    "the effect of triplet states on the second plateau is qualitatively the same as in the scenario with asymmetric coupling discussed above . for positive bias",

    "behave generically .",
    "the first plateau for negative bias is again due to tunneling processes involving the states b and g. at the second plateau the triplet t starts participating in the transport and is strongly occupied , resulting in ndc and super - poissonian noise as discussed above . at even more negative bias",
    "there exists a second region of ndc ( for the cases @xmath173 and @xmath174 ) .",
    "this is where the anti - bonding state ( not depicted in the spectrum in the right panel of fig .",

    "therefore has a similar effect on transport as a larger detuning at fixed hopping .",

    "[ fig : var_t2 ] , the maximum current at very large bias ( not shown ) is actually independent of the hopping @xmath17 .",
    "this is due to our neglect of off - diagonal matrix elements of the reduced density matrix .",

    "they have studied the shot noise through two coupled quantum dots via a quantum rate equation , i.e. a master equation involving also the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix .",

    "naturally , a straight perturbative approach as ours does not make sense for such large @xmath169 ( at least not to first order in @xmath169 ) , so our results apply to the explicit case of weak coupling , such that @xmath169 is the smallest energy scale .",

    ".    however , it is important to note that the approach of ref .   imposes severe restrictions on the transport situations it can treat .",
    "the applied bias has to be very large , such that all states ( or excitations ) of the dots that are considered for transport lie well in between the fermi levels ( chemical potentials ) of the electrodes . on the other hand",
    ", the states not considered for transport should be very far away from the chemical potentials of the leads .",
    "figuratively speaking , the approach of ref",
    ".   applies to the center of a very long ( in principle , infinitely long ) plateau of the i - v characteristics .",
    "such plateaus are not realized for the situations we considered , with the exception of the last plateau , when the bias is much larger than _ all _ excitations ( or energies ) of the dot system . in ref .   the large bias regime for a spinless version of our hamiltonian ( implying also @xmath179 ) and the cases @xmath180 as well as @xmath181 were considered . for @xmath180 we have a non - interacting system of spinless fermions , whereas for @xmath181 only states with at most a single ( spinless ) electron on the dot system are relevant . the results of ref .   for current and shot noise for @xmath182 approach our results (",
    "not shown ) , as it should be . if @xmath183 is not negligibly small , corrections to our results become noticeable that reduce the current and the shot noise , but also the fano factor .",
    "if @xmath184 the system turns into an effective single barrier system , so that the current is @xmath185 and the noise becomes poissonian , @xmath186 .",
    "recently , two groups@xcite claimed to have extended the approach of ref .   to the arbitrary bias regime .",
    "the results of ref .   for the current on single dot systems are in perfect agreement with earlier work by us @xcite .",
    "this is expected , as there are no possible `` coherence effects '' in a single level system , if spin is conserved in tunneling .",
    "whereas ref .   does not discuss interacting double dot systems ( or shot noise ) ref .   also considers the spinless version of our dqd hamiltonian .",
    "they discuss both current and shot noise through a double dot system with resonant levels @xmath104 and an infinitely large intra - dot repulsion @xmath20 , starting from an empty dot system as a ground state .",
    "therefore , they can only consider two possible regimes with finite current .",
    "i ) for a bias @xmath187 , they consider to have at most one electron on the double dot system . in this case",
    "they recover the result of ref .   for the case @xmath188 .",
    "ii ) for bias larger than all excitation energies ( @xmath189 ) ) they recover the _ non - interacting _ result of ref .  .",
    "in contrast , in our approach there are two additional possible transport situation that arise from the fact that there are two eigenstates in a singly occupied double dot system , namely the bonding ( b ) and the anti - bonding ( a ) state that differ by the energy @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , in general there will be two steps corresponding to excitations of the bonding state ( @xmath87 ) and the anti - bonding state ( @xmath191 ) out of the ground state ( @xmath192 ) and another two steps corresponding to the excitation energies to the doubly occupied state at @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "hence , the current and noise characteristics for the double dot system with @xmath195 should show four steps , unless broadening effects due to temperature or the line width @xmath169 are so large that they smear out the steps . in ref .  ,",
    "6 , there are only two steps which are broadened by temperature only ( via the fermi functions ) .",
    "therefore , at best it corresponds to a situation for which @xmath196 , i.e. a situation in which the system resembles more an effective single barrier system at high temperature .",
    "the `` concatenation '' of two results by ref .   that are derived under the assumption of effectively infinite bias in ref",
    ".   also leads to the peculiar effect that the current exhibits ndc behavior for a ratio of @xmath197 .",
    "while it is possible that a fully spatially symmetric system can display ndc @xcite , in our weak coupling theory ( @xmath198 ) of the dqd system ndc can only occur with broken symmetry such as detuned level energies , asymmetric couplings etc . as discussed in this paper .",
    "@xcite the ndc effect in ref .   occurs in a parameter regime where our theory clearly does not apply .",

    "includes level renormalization terms left out by ref .",
    "that modify the current characteristics qualitatively in the regime @xmath199 .",
    "this shows that the inclusion of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix is a rather delicate matter .",
    "in summary we have discussed transport through a double quantum dot ( dqd ) system with both intra- and inter - dot coulomb interactions in the sequential transport picture , as currently studied by several experimental groups . we found that the behavior of the shot noise in the coulomb blockade is directly related to the underlying low energy spectrum of the dqd system characterized by two intrinsic energy scales , the sequential tunneling energy @xmath3 and the first vertical excitation energy out of the ground state , @xmath4 .",
    "for a symmetric system in the coulomb blockade we distinguished between three scenarios : i ) for a first vertical excitation energy that is smaller than twice the sequential tunneling energy @xmath133 the fano factor ( noise ) is always sub - poissonian , i.e. @xmath200 , as sequential processes start before excited states come into play .",
    "ii ) if @xmath105 thermally activated sequential transport leads to super - poissonian fano factors in the bias range @xmath201 .",
    "iii ) for the case @xmath117 the fano factor remains super - poissonian in the entire coulomb blockade regime .",
    "our findings are valid for arbitrary ground state charges and also apply to larger systems with more than two coupled dots , as they depend only on the above mentioned generic energy scales of the interacting dot system .    additionally , we discussed the effect of asymmetries in the system realized by either asymmetric couplings to the electrodes or by detuning the quantum dot levels out of resonance with each other . in the case of asymmetric",
    "dot - electrode couplings we obtained an asymmetric current voltage characteristics as has been observed in experiments before . for very strong",
    "asymmetry negative differential conductance and eventually super - poissonian noise with fano factors @xmath123 develop .",
    "these features develop at the same energy positions , i.e. at the same bias voltage for any asymmetry ratio @xmath202 since the dqd spectrum remains unchanged .",
    "in contrast detuning the dot levels out of resonance also leads to ndc and super - poissonian noise for sufficiently strong asymmetry , but now at voltages that depend on the strength of the asymmetry as the dqd spectrum is changed .",
    "these features only appear for one bias direction , @xmath203 or @xmath204 , depending on which coupling @xmath63 ( @xmath29=right , left ) is suppressed or which quantum dot has a lower level energy .",
    "furthermore , we found that at a fixed detuning @xmath161 the current is reduced with decreasing inter - dot hopping @xmath17 .",
    "the latter results in a stronger localization of states on individual dots similar to the case of strongly detuned quantum dots .",
    "therefore a weaker inter - dot hopping and a stronger detuning at fixed inter - dot hopping cause similar transport characteristics .    to conclude",
    ", we have shown that transport properties of double quantum dots , in particular the shot noise , show a strong sensitivity on the internal electronic structure and the coupling strengths to the electrodes .",
