    "<S> we show that the next - to - leading corrections to the kernel of the gap equation can be large and of opposite sign to the lowest order kernel , in the presence of a gauge boson mass . </S>",
    "<S> this calls into question the reliability of the most attractive channel hypothesis .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( 310,205)utpt-98 - 06 ( 310,190)hep - ph/9804311    there are few rigorous results for the case of dynamical symmetry breaking in theories which are neither supersymmetric or qcd - like . </S>",
    "<S> efforts to build realistic models based on this large class of theories have then relied on various dynamical assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> one dynamical assumption in particular has had a major impact on model building . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most attractive channel ( mac ) hypothesis @xcite , which assumes that symmetry breaking will be dictated by a fermion bilinear condensing in the channel which is most attractive under the exchange of one gauge boson . </S>",
    "<S> this is a simple prescription which receives support from qcd and which can be easily applied to other theories . </S>",
    "<S> it ties in closely with the ladder approximation to the gap equation , which is the basis of many studies of chiral symmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> the gap equation analysis does in fact provide some support for the mac hypothesis , in the sense that it provides an estimate of the critical coupling required for symmetry breaking to occur . </S>",
    "<S> this critical coupling is often significantly less @xcite than what might be expected for a truly strong gauge coupling , with the latter being @xmath0 . for a critical coupling smaller than this </S>",
    "<S> , it is then somewhat plausible that corrections beyond the ladder graphs could be rather small . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility was reinforced by the study in @xcite , where corrections to the kernel of the gap equation were considered to second ( next - to - leading ) order . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections were found to be at the 20% level or less .    in @xcite the case of an unbroken strong gauge interaction with small @xmath1-function ( walking theory ) was considered , and the second order kernel was explored in a certain momentum region ( one momentum much larger than another ) in order to obtain analytical results . </S>",
    "<S> we will complement that study by instead considering the second order kernel for the momentum region expected to dominate in the loop integrations in the effective action . </S>",
    "<S> our main object is to consider the implications of a possible gauge boson mass , associated with the breakdown of the strong gauge interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a gauge boson mass in the fermion gap equation should be considered for consistency , since the mac hypothesis claims to differentiate between different symmetry breaking patterns , some of which cause the gauge symmetry itself to break . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a gauge boson mass can cause the order @xmath2 term in the kernel to be as large or larger than the order @xmath3 term , and of opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the use of the mac prescription to decide which channel actually does condense very uncertain .    </S>",
    "<S> we will consider @xmath4 flavors of fermions all in the fundamental representation of the gauge group @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective action in euclidean space is @xmath6s ) - \\mathrm{(2pi\\ diagrams)}\\ ] ] where the fermion propagator is @xmath7)^ { { - 1}}.\\ ] ] flavor and color indices are implicit .    </S>",
    "<S> it is typical that the dominant contributions to this effective potential come from momentum scales larger than @xmath8 , in which case we can perform an expansion in powers of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be rigorously justified @xcite in the case of a walking theory . </S>",
    "<S> a different situation in which this expansion may be justified will emerge below . </S>",
    "<S> if we expand the effective potential to second order in @xmath8 , we find that the leading piece ( zeroth order in @xmath9 ) of the equation @xmath10 reads @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the massless fermion propagator .    by making use of ( [ a ] ) @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the piece quadratic in @xmath8 in the effective action becomes @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 is a truncated 4-point function which incorporates the appropriate symmetry factors of the original 2pi diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath16 s are constant matrices in color / flavor / spinor space and are nontrivial only in color space , where they reflect the representation @xmath17 of @xmath5 in which the fermion mass lies .    </S>",
    "<S> when the momentum integrals in ( [ b ] ) are defined with an infrared cutoff @xmath18 , for example @xmath19 , then @xmath8 is determined nonperturbatively from the gap equation @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath15 are determined perturbatively from ( [ a ] ) and ( [ c ] ) , where massless fermion propagators are used . </S>",
    "<S> we renormalize in the @xmath22 scheme , so that @xmath21 and @xmath15 become functions of the renormalization scale @xmath23 , the gauge coupling @xmath24 and the gauge parameter @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we will choose feynman gauge @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the usual analysis we are exploring displays a gauge dependence , as explicitly obtained in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this due to the presence of a nonlocal fermion mass and only a local gauge boson - fermion vertex in the effective action . </S>",
    "<S> gauge independence would require additional contributions to gauge boson - fermion vertices proportional to the nonlocal mass . in the case of a massive gauge boson </S>",
    "<S> there is a goldstone boson - fermion vertex which is also proportional to the nonlocal fermion mass . </S>",
    "<S> we shall restrict ourselves to the usual analysis and not consider any diagram which introduces a dependence on the fermion mass through a vertex .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall investigate the perturbative expansion of the kernel @xmath27 notice that the well known group theory factor appearing in the first order term also multiplies the second order term . </S>",
    "<S> this factor includes all the dependence on the representation @xmath17 of the condensing channel ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the representations of the two fermions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of this at second order is a result of keeping only the diagrams which are leading in either @xmath30 or @xmath4 , as displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . is the singlet channel , the nonleading diagrams are suppressed by @xmath31 ; otherwise the suppression is @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> and we note in particular that the nonleading crossed - ladder graph is small even without the group theory suppression . ]    at first order @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a possible gauge boson mass . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath35 in ( [ pk ] ) will be defined by normalizing @xmath36 relative to @xmath37 at some momenta which dominates the integrations in the effective action ( [ b ] ) , as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> the integrals over @xmath38 and @xmath39 in ( [ b ] ) could be exchanged for integrals over @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> there is then some momentum @xmath42 which dominates the integral over @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this scale is determined dynamically by the form of @xmath44 , and it makes sense to set the renormalization scale @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for an unbroken gauge symmetry in the walking limit , @xmath42 is much larger than @xmath46 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is another scale in the problem when the gauge boson has mass @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect that @xmath42 will be much smaller than @xmath34 , since @xmath34 acts as a natural infrared cutoff . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath42 is much larger than @xmath34 then we revert to the previous case in which the gauge boson mass plays no role in the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the massive case we assume that the dynamics is such that @xmath42 and @xmath34 are of the same order , and so we set @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore led to the following normalization of @xmath36 at the point @xmath48 , where we note that the maximum value of @xmath49 occurs for @xmath50 for a fixed @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 with this normalization , the size of @xmath35 provides a measure of the importance of higher order effects . </S>",
    "<S> it is a conservative estimate , since the @xmath3 in ( [ pk ] ) could be larger than unity and closer to @xmath53 if the interaction is truly strong . </S>",
    "<S> our measure of the higher order effects differs somewhat from that in @xcite ; there the simplifying assumption @xmath54 was made , in which case it was sufficient to evaluate the kernel at the point @xmath55 .    to obtain @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> we perform the angular integration in ( [ e ] ) numerically . when the gauge boson is massless we find @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the last term arises from the @xmath21 factors in ( [ e ] ) , the second term from the fermion loop diagram , and the first term from the other diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus when the number of fermions is small , the second order kernel reinforces the attraction found at lowest order in the singlet channel . for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with fermions in the fundamental representation , we have @xmath61 . for increasing numbers of fermions , @xmath62 decreases , and </S>",
    "<S> it becomes negative when the number of fermions are large enough to result in a small @xmath63-function , corresponding to the condition @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> for example for @xmath59 and @xmath65 we have @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath41 for fixed @xmath51 is quite different from that displayed by @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main source of difference between our result and that in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the case that the gauge boson is massive . </S>",
    "<S> we will continue to use feynman gauge and will ignore the additional diagrams involving goldstone bosons which are all subleading in @xmath32 . to be specific </S>",
    "<S> we consider the breakdown of @xmath5 to @xmath67 , corresponding to a fermion mass in the symmetric tensor representation , with the single massive fermion being a @xmath67 singlet . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath68 for example for @xmath59 and @xmath69 we have @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the massless case we also find that @xmath37 and @xmath36 have a much more similar dependence on @xmath41 for fixed @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that the order @xmath2 term in the kernel of the gap equation is large and of opposite sign to the order @xmath3 term .    </S>",
    "<S> the main uncertainty in @xmath71 is that the true values of @xmath42 , @xmath34 , and @xmath23 may in fact deviate from our assumption of equality . </S>",
    "<S> we stress though that @xmath42 is dynamically determined from the form of @xmath44 , and its value should be such as to maximize the attraction in the preferred channel . </S>",
    "<S> a more minor source of uncertainty is in the relation of the two gauge boson masses corresponding to diagonal and nondiagonal generators respectively ( we have denoted the latter mass by @xmath34 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers appearing in ( [ d ] ) assume that the former is @xmath72 times as large as the latter , as may be expected when @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the possibility of a symmetry breaking solution is self - consistent , in the sense that attraction in this channel is a consequence of the gauge boson mass which in turn is consistent with the symmetry breaking fermion mass . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> other conditions must be satisfied before gauge symmetry breaking can occur ; in particular the theory can not be purely vectorlike @xcite . besides theories which are explicitly chiral , additional gauge interactions or nonrenormalizable interactions generated by physics at a higher scale </S>",
    "<S> may make a theory effectively chiral . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also applies to situations where the source of the gauge boson mass is something other than the strong dynamics in question .    </S>",
    "<S> we now return to the validity of the expansion in @xmath9 , which has been justified so far only for the case of an unbroken , walking theory . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion would be justified in the broken theory if a fermion mass smaller than @xmath34 emerged , since @xmath34 sets the scale for the dominant momenta in the loops . </S>",
    "<S> we now see that there could be a dynamical reason for this to occur . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that from ( [ d ] ) we see that the fermion loop ( the term with @xmath4 ) tends to enhance the strength of the second order kernel . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore see that a fermion mass small compared to @xmath34 enhances the chance that the mass forms , since a large fermion mass damps the fermion loop contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to qcd where a large quark mass and the resulting damping of the fermion loop enhances the lowest order attraction in the color singlet channel ( see ( [ k ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> of course we are only pointing out a possible mechanism , since higher order effects are important and unknown .    </S>",
    "<S> we have explored the case of a broken gauge symmetry and have found that there is little reason to believe the lowest order most attractive channel hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> although this result runs counter to conventional wisdom concerning mac , it is not terribly surprising  when the coupling is large , higher order effects can be important . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of gauge dependence also plagues the usual analysis , but there is no reason to expect that additional contributions present in a gauge invariant treatment would cancel those that we have found . </S>",
    "<S> our results are sufficient to call into question the use of the mac hypothesis as a test of whether or not gauge symmetries break . </S>",
    "<S> more powerful techniques are needed to study the symmetry breaking patterns of interest for the construction of realistic theories of mass and flavor . </S>"
