    "recently a large number of binary millisecond pulsars ( bmsps ) with relatively heavy white dwarf ( wd ) companions have been reported .",
    "these pulsars form a distinct class of bmsps ( cf .",
    "table  1 ) which are characterized by relatively slow spin periods ( @xmath4 ms ) and high period derivatives : @xmath5 .",
    "it has been suggested that such bmsps evolved through a common envelope and spiral - in phase ( e.g. van  den  heuvel 1994 ) .",
    "this gives a natural explanation for their close orbits and the presence of a relatively heavy co / o - ne - mg wd , if the mass transfer was initiated while the donor star ( the progenitor of the wd ) ascended the agb .",
    "however , it has been argued that a neutron star engulfed in a common envelope might experience hypercritical accretion and thereby collapse into a black hole ( e.g. chevalier 1993 ; brown 1995 ) .",
    "if this picture is correct then these bmsps can not have formed in a common envelope and spiral - in phase .",
    "here we investigate an alternative scenario for producing the mildly recycled bmsps with he or co wd in close orbits , in which a 26@xmath0 donor star , with a non- ( or partly ) convective envelope , transfers mass on a sub - thermal timescale and yet in a dynamically stable mode .",
    "the stability and nature of the mass transfer is very important in binary stellar evolution .",
    "it depends on the response of the mass - losing donor star and of the roche - lobe ( e.g. paczynski 1976 ; soberman , phinney & van  den  heuvel 1997 ) .",
    "the mass transfer is stable as long as the donor star s roche - lobe continues to enclose the star .",
    "otherwise it is unstable and proceeds on the shortest unstable timescale .",
    "as long as the mass of the donor , @xmath6 is less than @xmath7 the mass transfer will be dynamically stable for all initial orbital periods ( e.g. tauris & savonije 1999 ) .",
    "these lmxbs are the progenitors of the bmsps with a helium wd companion . the observational absence of x - ray binaries with roche - lobe filling companions more massive than @xmath8 has been attributed to their inability to transfer mass in such a stable mode that the system becomes a persistent long - lived x - ray source ( van  den  heuvel 1975 ; kalogera & webbink 1996 ) .",
    "below we investigate for these systems how the stability of the rlo depends on the evolutionary status of the donor ( and hence the orbital period ) at the onset of mass transfer .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of a large number of x - ray binaries with a donor star of mass @xmath9 and a @xmath1 accreting neutron star .",
    "both the radius of the donor star as well as its roche - lobe are functions of time and mass ( as a consequence of nuclear burning , magnetic braking and other tidal spin - orbit couplings ) .",
    "we used an updated version of eggleton s numerical computer code ( pols  et  al .",
    "1998 ) to keep track of the stellar evolution and included a number of binary interactions to carefully follow the details of the mass - transfer process .",
    "for all donor stars considered here we assumed a chemical composition of x=0.70 and z=0.02 , and a mixing - length parameter of @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) for a detailed description of our computer code .",
    "the maximum accretion rate onto a neutron star is given approximately by the eddington limit for spherical accretion of a hydrogen gas , @xmath11 yr@xmath12 .",
    "if the mass - transfer rate from the donor star , @xmath13 is larger than this limit , radiation pressure from the accreted material will cause the infalling matter to be ejected from the system at a rate :    @xmath14 + in systems with very large mass - transfer rates , matter piles up around the neutron star and presumably forms a growing , bloated cloud engulfing a large fraction of the accretion disk . a system will only avoid a spiral - in if it manages to evaporate the bulk of the transferred matter via the liberated accretion energy .",
    "this would require the radius of the accretion cloud , @xmath15 in order for the liberated accretion energy to eject the transfered material ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the radius of the neutron star ) .",
    "if the material which is to be ejected comes closer to the neutron star it will have too much negative binding energy in order for the liberated accretion energy to expel it . at the same time @xmath19 must be smaller than the roche - lobe radius of the neutron star during the entire evolution , if formation of a common envelope ( ce ) is to be avoided can be smaller than estimated above . ] . +",
    "a simple isotropic re - emission model will approximately remain valid for our scenario . in this model",
    "it is assumed that matter flows over conservatively from the donor star to the vicinity of the neutron star before it is ejected with the specific orbital angular momentum of the neutron star . assuming this to be the case we find that ,",
    "even for extremely high mass - transfer rates ( @xmath20 ) , the system can avoid a ce and spiral - in evolution .",
    "in fig .  1 we show the evolution of a binary initially consisting of a neutron star and a zero age main - sequence companion star with masses @xmath23 and @xmath21 , respectively , and initial orbital period @xmath22 days .",
    "at the age of @xmath24 myr the companion has evolved to fill its roche - lobe ( @xmath25 ; @xmath26 k ) and rapid mass transfer is initiated ( a ) .",
    "the donor star has just evolved past the ms hook in the hr - diagram and is burning hydrogen in a shell around a @xmath27 helium core . prior to the mass - transfer phase",
    ", a radiation - driven wind ( @xmath28 yr@xmath12 ) has caused the donor to decrease its mass slightly ( @xmath29 ) and consequently resulted in a slight widening of the orbit ( @xmath30 days ) .",
    "once the donor fills its roche - lobe it is seen to lose mass at a very high rate of @xmath31 yr@xmath32 . at this stage",
    "the donor has only developed a very thin convective envelope of size @xmath33 , so its envelope is still radiative and will therefore shrink in response to mass loss . at @xmath34",
    "myr its radius has decreased to a minimum value of @xmath35 , but now @xmath36 . at this point ( s )",
    "the donor has a mass of @xmath37 , @xmath38 k , and @xmath39 days .",
    "the donor expands again , but shortly thereafter , its rate of expansion slows down causing @xmath40 to decrease to @xmath41 .",
    "the mass transfer ceases ( b ) when the donor has an age of 178.3 myr . at this stage",
    "@xmath42 days , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 k. the mass of the donor is @xmath46 .",
    "it still has a @xmath27 helium core , but now only a @xmath47 envelope consisting of 16% h and 82% he .",
    "the mass - transfer phase ( a  b ) lasts relatively short : @xmath48 myr , and hence the neutron star will only accrete : @xmath49 .",
    "this leads to relative large values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the ( mildly ) recycled pulsar .",
    "as the mass - transfer rate is always highly super - eddington during the rlo , and the accreting neutron star will be enshrouded by a thick ( bloated ) disk , it is doubtful whether it will be observable as an x - ray binary during this phase  except very briefly just at the onset and near the end of the rlo .",
    "we followed the evolution of the donor star further on .",
    "the donor continues to burn hydrogen in its light envelope . at @xmath52 myr ( f ) the helium burning",
    "is finally ignited ( @xmath53 ) in the core which now has a mass of @xmath54 .",
    "after 70 myr ( @xmath55 myr since the zams ) the core - helium burning is exhausted ( g ) .",
    "the @xmath56 core then has a chemical composition of 19% c , 79% o and 2% ne .",
    "it is surrounded by a @xmath57 envelope ( 16% h , 82% he , 1% n@xmath58 ) .",
    "the central density is @xmath59 g @xmath60 and @xmath61 . from here on the star contracts and settles as a hot co white dwarf .",
    "+ we have now demonstrated a scenario for producing a bmsp with the same characteristics as those listed in table  1 .      in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted the calculated final orbital periods as a function of the mass of the white dwarf companion ( the remnant of the donor ) for a given initial mass of the donor star .",
    "the values for the bmsps which originated from a binary with a low - mass companion ( the former lmxbs with @xmath64 located on the upper branch ) are taken from tauris & savonije ( 1999 ) .",
    "these white dwarfs are expected to be helium wd  unless the initial orbital period was very large ( @xmath65 days ) so a relatively heavy helium core developed prior to the rlo , in which case the helium core later ignited forming a co wd .",
    "+ the final product of x - ray binaries with @xmath66 are seen to deviate significantly from the low - mass branch .",
    "the reason is the former systems had a large mass ratio , @xmath67 which caused the binary separation to shrink initially upon mass transfer  cf .",
    "fig .  1 .",
    "such systems only `` survive '' the mass - transfer phase if the envelope of the donor is radiative or slightly convective .",
    "this sets an upper limit on the initial orbital period for a given system .",
    "if the donor is in a wide binary it develops a deep convective envelope prior to filling its roche - lobe and it will therefore expand rapidly in response to mass loss which , in combination with the orbital shrinking , will result in the formation of a ce and a ( tidally unstable ) spiral - in evolution .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "3 we show how the final orbital period and the mass of the wd depends on the initial orbital period for a binary with @xmath21 .",
    "we notice that the question of initiating rlo before or after the termination of hydrogen core burning ( case a or early case b , respectively ) is important for these relations . for initial @xmath68 days ( case a rlo )",
    ", @xmath69 decreases with increasing @xmath62 .",
    "the reason is simply that in these systems the donor star is still on the the main - sequence and the mass of its helium core , at the onset of rlo , increases strongly with @xmath62 and therefore the amount of material to be transferred ( the donor s envelope ) decreases with @xmath62 .",
    "since the orbit widens efficiently near the end of the mass transfer , when the mass ratio between donor and accretor has been inverted ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 )",
    ", @xmath69 will also decrease as a function of initial @xmath62 .",
    "however , for @xmath70 days ( early case b rlo ) the final orbital period increases with initial orbital period as expected  the core mass of the donor only increases slightly ( due to hydrogen shell burning ) as a function of initial @xmath62 .      in fig .",
    "4 we outline the results of our work in a diagram showing the fate of a binary as a function of its initial @xmath62 and the value of @xmath6 .",
    "we conclude that x - ray binaries with @xmath72 can avoid a spiral - in and ce evolution if @xmath62 is between 120 days , depending on @xmath6 .",
    "if the initial @xmath62 is too short , the systems will obviously enter a ce phase , since these system always decrease their orbital separation when the mass transfer is initiated . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial @xmath62 is too large the donor develops a deep convective envelope prior to rlo and a runaway mass - transfer event is unavoidable , also leading to a ce formation . for systems with @xmath64 and initial @xmath73 day",
    "the outcome is a bmsp with an ultra low - mass degenerate hydrogen star ( e.g. psr  j20510827 , cf .",
    "ergma , sarna & antipova 1998 ) .",
    "we have now demonstrated how to form a bmsp with a relatively heavy ( he or co ) wd companion without evolving through a ce phase . if a substantial fraction of bmsps have evolved through a phase with super - eddington mass transfer on a sub - thermal timescale ( a few myr )",
    ", this will eliminate the need for a long x - ray phase .",
    "this would therefore help solving the birthrate problem between bmsps and lmxbs ( kulkarni & narayan 1988 ) for systems with @xmath74 days .",
    "+ it has recently been suggested ( podsiadlowski & rappaport 1999 ; king & ritter 1999 ) that cygnus x-2 descended from an intermediate - mass x - ray binary via a scenario which resembles the one described here .",
    "we confirm that cygnus  x-2 is a progenitor candidate for a bmsp with a heavy wd .",
    "it is seen from fig .  2 that we can not reproduce the systems with very massive o - ne - mg wd or the short orbital periods ( @xmath75 days ) observed in some systems with a co wd .",
    "we therefore conclude that these binaries most likely evolved through a ce phase where frictional torques were responsible for their present short @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "thin lines in fig .  2 and gray area in fig .  4 )",
    "these systems therefore seem to originate from binaries which initially had a relatively _ large _ @xmath62 and case c rlo  otherwise if @xmath62 was small the stellar components would have coalesced either in the spiral - in process , or as a result of gravitational wave radiation shortly thereafter ( typically within 1 gyr for systems surviving case b rlo and spiral - in ) .",
