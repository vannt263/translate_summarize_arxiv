    "the ising model turned out to be very convenient model for the investigation of magnetic properties of strongly anisotropic materials .",
    "in particular , the two - dimensional spin-1/2 ising model and other exactly solvable models play an important role in statistical mechanics of cooperative phenomena .",
    "although , in most of theoretical studies the exchange interaction is usually assumed to be of short - range , in many real magnetic insulators the exchange coupling between magnetic atoms is predominantly carried out by means of the indirect exchange through the intermediary non - magnetic atom ( the so - called superexchange interaction ) . in order to describe these materials theoretically ,",
    "fisher introduced a two - dimensional antiferromagnetic ising model on the decorated square lattice , in which the interaction between decorating magnetic atoms realized via intermediate non - magnetic atoms was considered @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the fisher superexchange antiferromagnet is one of the few exactly solvable models in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "in fact , until its establishing , the ising model in a nonzero magnetic field was included in the class of unsolved problems in statistical mechanics . consequently , the effect of external magnetic field on magnetic properties was investigated only applying various approximate methods , the solutions of which were in many cases in no good agreement with each other as well as with experiments .",
    "the typical example of the experimental as well as theoretical discussions is the behavior of initial susceptibility in antiferromagnetic solids . some experiments and approximations predicted that susceptibility has a maximum at a critical point and falls away on either its site . according to others",
    ", the zero - field susceptibility passes through a maximum up to above the critical temperature . at the critical temperature",
    "it shows the infinite slope .",
    "moreover , no approximate methods yield explicit expressions for the initial susceptibility as a function of temperature , nor do they indicate how it behaves in a finite magnetic field .",
    "the only case in which the magnetic susceptibility as well as other thermodynamic quantities can be exactly calculated is fisher two - dimensional model .",
    "however , this model is only one of a number of similar exactly solvable antiferromagnetic lattices and its simple generalization leads to a series of other models which could display a variety of interesting features . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", only two generalizations of fisher model have been investigated so far , namely , the superexchange ising model on the kagome lattice @xcite and the decorated ising model which is the combination of the fisher model and the shiozi - miyazima model of dilute - ising spin system @xcite .",
    "considering this fact , the main purpose of the present work is to generalize the original superexchange model for arbitrary values of decorating atoms including also the effect of the uniaxial crystal - field anisotropy as well .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "the basic points of the exact solution are briefly presented . in sec.3",
    "we discuss the most interesting results for the ground - state phase diagram , critical temperature and thermodynamics properties of the system under investigation .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in sec.4 .",
    "in this article we will consider a generalized fisher superexchange antiferromagnet on the square lattice ( see fig.1 ) , in which vertex sites are occupied by the fixed spin-@xmath0 atoms ( open circles ) and decorating sites by the spin-@xmath1 atoms ( @xmath2 ) ( closed and obliquely lined circles ) .",
    "hence , we assume that horizontal and vertical decorating spins interact with each other through the so - called superexchange leading to an antiferromagnetic long - range order . similarly to fisher @xcite , we also suppose that all horizontal decorating spins are coupled with their nearest neighbors through an antiferromagnetic interaction , whereas in the vertical direction , there is a ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor exchange interaction .",
    "furthermore , including the effects of external longitudinal field and uniaxial crystal - field anisotropy on all decorating atoms , the total hamiltonian of the system can be written in the form @xmath3",
    "i0.5        where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , denote the standard spin operators of spin-1/2 and spin-@xmath1 ising atoms , the first and second terms describe the exchange interaction between the nearest neighbors in the horizontal and vertical direction and the last two expressions describe the interaction of decorating atoms with the uniaxial crystal - field anisotropy @xmath6 and the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath8 represents the exchange integral between the nearest neighbors .    for later convenience",
    ", it is useful to rewrite the total hamiltonian ( [ eq : hd ] ) in the form @xmath9 , where the first ( second ) term represents the sum of bond hamiltonians involving all interaction terms associated with the decorating atoms on the horizontal ( vertical ) bonds and that are defined as follows : @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 for horizontal and vertical bonds , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 specifies the type of exchange interaction , thus for @xmath14 we put @xmath15 ( antiferromagnetic exchange ) and for @xmath16 is @xmath17 ( ferromagnetic exchange ) .",
    "the most important point of our calculation is the evaluation of the partition function @xmath18 of the investigated system .",
    "the validity of commutation relation for the bond hamiltonians ( i.e. @xmath19 = 0 $ ] , for @xmath20 ) enables one to rewrite @xmath18 in the partially factorized form , namely @xmath21 in the above , @xmath22 , ( @xmath23 being boltzmann constant and @xmath24 the absolute temperature ) and @xmath25 means a trace over the degrees of freedom of spin-1/2 ising vertex spins . finally , the bond partition functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 furnish traces over all remaining degrees of freedom and they are given by @xmath28 \\big ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes a trace over spin-@xmath1 decorating atom on the @xmath30th horizontal ( @xmath11 ) or vertical ( @xmath31 ) bond , respectively .",
    "the latter relation implies the possibility of introducing the the decoration - iteration mapping transformation @xcite @xmath32 considering all possible configurations of the spins @xmath33 and @xmath34 in previous equations one finds that @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , when equation ( [ eq : dit ] ) is substituted into ( [ eq : zd ] ) , the magnetic contributions @xmath36 and @xmath37 belonging to the vertex spins of the lattice cancel out and the partition function of the system @xmath18 reduces to the form @xmath38 here , @xmath39 represents the partition function of the standard spin-@xmath0 ising square lattice without external longitudinal magnetic field and the transformation parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 depends on the temperature , external magnetic field and spin @xmath1 of decorating atoms and it is defined as @xmath44 it is worth noticing that equation ( [ eq : zdz0 ] ) relates the partition function of the studied model in the presence of an external magnetic field and that of the standard zero - field spin-@xmath0 ising model on the square lattice . since the explicit expression for @xmath39 is known @xcite , we can straightforwardly calculate many relevant physical quantities based on the familiar thermodynamic relations . on the other hand , some important quantities , such as the staggered magnetization or correlation functions can not be obtained within thermodynamic approach .",
    "fortunately , this problem can be solved utilizing the following exact spin identities @xcite @xmath45 where arbitrary function @xmath46 depends on vertex spin variables , the function @xmath47 depends on the spin variables of the @xmath30th bond only and the symbols @xmath48 and @xmath49 stand for the standard canonical averages of the original and decorated lattice , respectively .",
    "for example , applying the identity ( [ eq : f1f2 ] ) , one simply attains the following results for the sublattice magnetization in the horizontal direction @xmath50 where coefficients @xmath51 depend on the temperature , external magnetic field and crystal field .",
    "moreover , we have introduced the sublattice magnetization @xmath52 and correlation function @xmath53 .",
    "very similar equations but with different coefficient can also be derived for the correlation function @xmath54 and quadrupolar momentum @xmath55 with @xmath56 . although the derivation of final equations for the above - mentioned quantities is straightforward , the calculation by itself is lengthy and tedious .",
    "therefore we do not present details here .",
    "finally , let us briefly comment on the choice of the order parameter in our model .",
    "in general , at low temperatures the antiferromagnets are distinguished by the long - range order with anti - parallel alignment of the nearest - neighboring magnetic moments ( or spins ) .",
    "this type of magnetic arrangement is usually described by the so - called staggered magnetization which is defined as a difference of reduced sublattice magnetization .",
    "it is also well - known that ising - type antiferromagnets in higher dimensions undergo a second - order phase transition at some critical temperature and the staggered magnetization is then nonzero below the critical temperature and vanishes above this temperature .",
    "however , as we have already mentioned at the beginning of this section , the long - range antiferromagnetic order between pairs of horizontal and vertical decorating atoms of the lattice is realized indirectly through intermediate non - magnetic vertex atoms .",
    "moreover , the vertex atoms ( that are not coupled to the external magnetic field ) also exhibit a spontaneous magnetization below the transition temperature .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to define the order parameter of the model under investigation in the form of binary vector , where the first vector component represents the absolute value of staggered magnetization ( @xmath57 ) describing the long - range antiferromagnetic ordering of horizontal and vertical decorating atoms , while the second one describes the spontaneous magnetization of the spin-@xmath0 ising sublattice .",
    "before discussing the most interesting numerical results , it is worth emphasizing that the superexchange model is generally slightly different from the standard antiferromagnetic ising models on the square lattice usually treated by most authors . in particular , the standard antiferromagnetic model becomes ferromagnetic when the sign of exchange integral @xmath58 is changed , whereas the superexchange model remains invariant against the transformation @xmath59 .",
    "it is also worth noting that for @xmath60 and @xmath61 our calculation recovers the results obtained by fisher , and mashiyama and nara @xcite .",
    "for this reason we concentrate here on the case @xmath62 which has not been discussed yet .",
    "@xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68     +    ' '' ''    & & & & & & & & + sap@xmath69 & 0.5 & -1.5 & 1.5 & 0.25 & -0.75 & 0.75 & 2.25 & 2.25     + sap@xmath70 & 0.5 & -0.5 & 0.5 & 0.25 & -0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25     + sap & 0.5 & -0.5 & 1.5 & 0.25 & -0.25 & 0.75 & 0.25 & 2.25     + fifp & 0.5 & 0.5 & 1.5 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.75 & 0.25 & 2.25     + pp@xmath69 & 0.0 & 1.5 & 1.5 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 2.25 & 2.25     + pp@xmath70 & 0.0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.25 & 0.25     +    now , let us proceed with the discussion of the ground state .",
    "possible phases at @xmath71 can be identified throught the analysis of all sublattice magnetization , pair - correlation functions and quadrupolar momenta belonging to the decorating spins and those of original undecorated ising lattice .",
    "the results of our investigation are collected in table 1 .",
    "as we can see , there exist six different phases , namely three superantiferromagnetic phases ( sap@xmath69 , sap@xmath70 and sap ) , one field - induced ferromagnetic phase ( fifp ) and two paramagnetic phases ( pp@xmath69 and pp@xmath70 ) . for a better illustration , we have depicted in figure 2 the ground - state phase diagram in the @xmath72 plane .",
    "i0.5        comparing the quantities evaluated above one easily observes that for sufficiently small magnetic fields , the decorating sublattice of the system always exhibits an antiferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "this is characterized by the mutually opposite signs of sublattice magnetization belonging to them : @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the sap@xmath69 , in the sap@xmath70 and @xmath75 and @xmath74 in the sap . moreover",
    ", the sublattice magnetization @xmath76 takes its saturated value in the whole region where the superantiferromagnetic phases are stable .",
    "consequently , the spin-1/2 ising atoms localized in vertexes of the lattice exhibit here exclusively the perfect ferromagnetic arrangement .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic field stronger than a certain critical value ( @xmath77 ) overturns anti - parallel decorating spins to its direction and consequently destroys the long - range antiferromagnetic ordering in the system .",
    "therefore , in the region of magnetic fields @xmath78 , both sublattice magnetization @xmath79 and @xmath63 will be positive : @xmath80 in the pp@xmath69 , @xmath81 in the pp@xmath70 and @xmath82 , @xmath74 in the fifp .",
    "in fact , for @xmath83 the fifp is the only stable ordered ground - state phase , which always exists in a relatively narrow region of the crystal fields .",
    "it is also interesting , that in spite of the external magnetic    i0.5        field being applied only on the decorating atoms , its sufficiently strong value indirectly effects the alignment of the ising spins in the vertexes of lattice . in fact , in both paramagnetic phases pp@xmath69 and pp@xmath70 the vertex non - magnetic spins are strongly frustrated due to the competitive effect of the magnetic field , crystal field and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "indeed , the zero values of all relevant correlation functions ( see table 1 ) clearly confirm the presence of frustration .",
    "one also finds that at the exact phase boundaries , the relevant phases co - exist implying the possibility of the first - order phase transition at @xmath71 .",
    "thus the ground - state behavior of our model is much more complex in comparison with the original fisher model .",
    "apart from the ground state properties , we have also calculated the critical temperatures at which the system undergoes the second - order phase transition .",
    "our results for the global phase diagram in the @xmath84 space are shown in figure 3 .",
    "as we can see , the critical temperature exhibits a very interesting behavior . naturally , the ordered ( disordered ) phases are stable bellow ( above ) the critical temperature .",
    "of course , in some regions the stability of disordered phases extends down to zero temperature in agreement with the ground - state phase diagram .",
    "one should    i0.5        also note that our model exhibits essentially the same critical behavior as fisher and mishiyama and nara models @xcite .",
    "this is obvious , since the decoration of the lattice by finite number of atoms can not lead to a change of the universality class of the model . as we have already mentioned above",
    ", one of the most interesting physical quantities in antiferromagnetic models represents the initial suceptibilty . in order to understand the behavior of this quantity , in figure 4 we have presented thermal variation of the initial susceptibility ( i.e @xmath85 ) for several typical values of the crystal - field anisotropy .",
    "besides the standard curves     of the order - parameter and the reduced sublattice magnetization @xmath86 for the decorated superexchange antiferromagnetic model with @xmath87 and some typical values of the magnetic field.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    ( see the curve labeled @xmath88 ) , we also obtained some new dependences with clear maxima in the low - temperature region ( see curves labeled @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "moreover , one finds that strong nagative value of the crystal field rapidly depresses the absolute value of the initial susceptibility and causes its very slow decreasing above @xmath91 ( see the case @xmath92 ) .",
    "this kind of dependences can not be observed in the original fisher model , since they originate from the crystal - field effects .",
    "the curve obtained for @xmath93 also represents a furter original result which exhibits a strong divergence as temperature approaches zero .",
    "this behavior indicates the appearence of the first - order phase transition , since in this case we are exactly located at the phase boundary of the ground state .     and some typical values of the magnetic field.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    finally , to illustrate the behavior of other physical quantities at finite temperatures , in figures 5 we have depicted thermal variations of the order parameter components @xmath94 and magnetization @xmath86 of decorating spins . in both figures we have fixed @xmath93 and have changed the values of magnetic field . comparing the behavior of the relevant quantities in figure 5 one observes the characteristic behavior of the order parameter components being nonzero below @xmath91 and vanishing at all temperatures above @xmath91 . on the other hand @xmath86 exhibit nonzero values in the whole temperature region .",
    "thus they can not serve as good order parameters for the model . at @xmath71",
    "all quantities take the corresponding characteristic values depending on the strength of the magnetic field . of particular interest",
    "is the curve for @xmath95 which apparently indicates the co - existemce of the sap@xmath69 and fifp at @xmath71 in agreement with the ground - state phase diagram . the existence of different phases and competitive effect of the magnetic field , crystal - field anisotropy and temperature are also reflected in the thermal dependences of the specific heat and susceptibility that are shown in figure 6 . both quantities exhibit characteristic behavior with interesting low - temperature maxima and logarithmic divergence at the critical temperature .",
    "in this work we have generalized the fisher superexchange antiferromagnetic model for the case of arbitrary decorating spins . excepting the external magnetic field we have also investigated the effect of the uniaxial crystal - field anisotropy .",
    "some preliminary results for the case of @xmath62 decorating atoms have revealed very rich and interesting behavior .",
    "further interesting results for the magnetization process , thermal and field dependences of the entropy , specific heat and susceptibility will be presented in the near future . moreover , more realistic versions of this model including the transverse magnetic field or biaxial crystal - field anisotropy are also exactly solvable and may potentially enrich our knowledge about exactly solvable models in statistical mechanics .",
