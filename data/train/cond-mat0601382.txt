    "the functions @xmath197 assume in this case the form for @xmath198 , @xmath199 the polarization dependence of @xmath200 is simply @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the angle between the neutron spin and the normal to the layers .",
    "@xmath200 assumes its largest value if the spin is perpendicular and is zero if the spin is parallel to the layers . in this case @xmath200",
    "diverges as @xmath203 for all polarizations of the neutron and the singular contribution is isotropic in the @xmath191 plane . for @xmath204 the dependencies of @xmath200 on the polarization and the momentum no longer factorize but can be worked out for the most general case using eq.([chin ] ) .      as discussed in the previous sections the total magnetic neutron cross section contains , in addition to the dominating spin flip contribution , an orbital part . above and not too far away from @xmath6 to the ddw state the scattering from fluctuating orbital moments produced by circulating currents around a plaquette",
    "are mainly concentrated around the wave vector @xmath205 .",
    "below @xmath6 there is an elastic bragg component at wave vector @xmath206 and a fluctuating part throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "though magnetic scattering from spin flip and orbital scattering have many features in common there are three main differences : a ) in spin scattering the form factor reflects the electron density distribution within an atom whereas in orbital scattering the form factor is related to the plaquette geometry which gives rise to the trigonometric functions in the functions @xmath207 ; b ) the long - range dipole - dipole interaction between neutrons and the electrons dominates in orbital scattering yielding a singular forward scattering peak below @xmath208 whereas the interaction between neutrons and electrons for spin scattering reduces to a local one ; c ) the intensity of orbital scattering is substantially smaller than that for spin scattering .",
    "for instance , a ratio of 1:70 has been obtained in ref . for bragg scattering . in the following we present results on frequency and in - plane momentum integrated scattering probabilities in the two cases . in this way the anomalous forward scattering contribution in orbital scattering can be taken into account in this comparison .",
    "we also recalculate the intensity for bragg scattering and find it much smaller than the value calculated in ref ..    the expression @xmath209 describes the scattering probability of an unpolarized neutron with momentum and frequency transfers @xmath193 and @xmath124 , respectively , from orbital fluctuations . integrating over frequency and the in - plane momentum @xmath190",
    "the integrated scattering probability @xmath210 becomes , using eq.([chinu1 ] ) and reinserting @xmath18 and @xmath19 for clarity , @xmath211 @xmath212 @xmath213 in eq.([wtotal ] ) @xmath210 has been splitted into a static bragg contribution @xmath214 and a dynamic part @xmath215 .",
    "correspondingly , the tilde in eq.([worb ] ) indicates that only the fluctuating part of the densities should be used in the correlation functions .",
    "similar considerations apply to unpolarized neutron scattering from spin fluctuations .",
    "the relevant susceptibility in the paramagnetic state is@xcite , @xmath216 @xmath217 is the atomic structure factor and @xmath218 the zz component of the electronic spin susceptibility . using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , approximating @xmath217 by @xmath219 , and assuming no magnetic coupling between the layers , the total scattering probability @xmath220 by spin fluctuations becomes@xcite , @xmath221 most interesting are the ratios of integrated orbital to spin scattering , i.e. , @xmath222 and @xmath223 . using the above",
    "results one obtains , @xmath224 with the dimensionless constant , @xmath225 and @xmath226     and @xmath227 for elastic and inelastic orbital to spin scattering , respectively .",
    ", width=264 ]    using @xmath228 we obtain from eq.([eps ] ) @xmath229 , which yields togther with @xmath230  @xmath231 for our doping @xmath167 .",
    "comparison of eq.([heff1 ] ) with eq.([h0 ] ) gives @xmath232 for @xmath158 and @xmath167 .",
    "furthermore , from eq.([fg ] ) we get @xmath233 which yields @xmath234 unlike in the case of spin scattering the momentum and frequency sums in eq.([rdyn ] ) are non - trivial and we have carried them out by numerical methods .",
    "8 shows the results for @xmath227 and @xmath235 as a function of @xmath174 at zero temperature .",
    "as expected @xmath227 increases strongly at small @xmath174 due to its logarithmic singularity at @xmath191 .",
    "integrating @xmath227 also over @xmath174 yields a value of about @xmath236 which is more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than @xmath235 .",
    "the reason for this large difference is due to the fact that in the momentum integration in @xmath227 mainly the small momenta contribute where @xmath237 is larger than 1 .",
    "in contrast to that , @xmath235 probes the integrand of @xmath227 at the large value @xmath238 where @xmath237 is very small .",
    "the extreme small value @xmath239 casts doubts on the identification of the observed bragg peak at @xmath52 with the bragg peak due a ddw@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if a ddw state is realized in some material we think that the resulting strong forward scattering peak in neutron scattering would be observable .",
    "according to our predictions it would exhaust roughly 3 per cent of the sum rule for spin scattering and thus be of the same order of magnitude as the recently detected elastic scattering from weak magnetic moments directed at least partially perpendicular to the layers@xcite in high-@xmath208 superconductors .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at large @xmath2 was studied for dopings where a ddw forms below a transition temperature @xmath6 .",
    "the density response includes `` conventional '' local density fluctuations , characterized by the energy scale @xmath0 , where practically all spectral weight is concentrated in a collective sound wave with approximately a sinusoidal dispersion .",
    "in addition , and this was the main topic of this investigation , there is a `` unconventional '' density response from orbital fluctuations caused by fluctuating circulating currents above @xmath6 and fluctuations around a staggered flux phase below @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding spectra are again mainly collective , their energy scale is @xmath1 or a fraction of it , and they can be viewed as order parameter modes of the ddw . at small momentum transfers",
    "the spectra are dominated by one well - defined peak corresponding to amplitude fluctuations of the ddw . for larger momentum transfers ,",
    "unconventional density fluctuations tend to become broad and their intensity suppressed .",
    "this is especially true near the point x where practically no weight is left for orbital fluctuations at low frequencies , but instead a rather sharp peak due to sound waves appear at large frequencies reflecting the coupling of the two kinds of density fluctuations .    in principle",
    "the above orbital fluctuations show up in the raman , x - ray and neutron scattering spectra .",
    "the predicted scattering intensities are , however , rather small .",
    "the reason for this is that , on the one hand , a rather small effective nearest - neighbor hopping element @xmath20 is needed to provide a sufficiently large density of states and the instability to the ddw , on the other hand , the square of @xmath20 appears as a prefactor in the various cross sections due to the peierls substitution . as a result , the @xmath13 integrated inelastic cross section is only a few per cents of that for spin scattering and the elastic scattering from the bragg peak is even much weaker . from our calculations",
    "it is also evident that a ddw state in the unconstrained , weak - coupling case would have very similar properties as in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "in particular , the curves for @xmath227 and @xmath235 would closely resemble those in fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "an experimental verification of a ddw state via inelastic neutrons seems to be not unfeasible because a good deal of the scattering intensity is concentrated in a well - pronounced , inelastic peak somewhat smaller than the ddw gap and in small region around the origin in @xmath10 space ."
