    "in the early evolutionary stages of star formation process , sequential depletion of molecular species on grain mantles nurtures a peculiar low - temperature chemistry due to the removal of important gas - phase reactants , starting with sulfur - bearing species and followed by even volatile molecules such as co ( bergin & tafalla 2007 ) . besides @xmath9 , @xmath10",

    "chemical models anticipate @xmath16 to be affected by a few factors such as the kinetic temperature and , for ion species , the electron abundance ( roueff et  al . 2005 ) as well as the gas - phase co abundance ( aikawa et  al . 2005 ) .",
    "the abundance of gas - phase co is expected to decline in the prestellar phase through molecular depletion onto grain surfaces but to rise up in the protostellar phase through sublimation of ice mantles as the envelope warms up .",

    "we have selected three dense cores in g28 to form an evolutionary sequence : starting with mm9 in an early stage of mass collection with one weak continuum source , followed by mm4 in a stage of mass fragmentation with at least five continuum sources , and mm1 in a later stage with embedded massive protostellar objects with a total luminosity of @xmath22 .",

    "the maximum optical depth , @xmath66 , is less than 0.21 ( table  [ table_smtfits ] ) .",
    "the emission of all the observed lines is optically thin .",
    "over all , the fitted line widths , @xmath59 , of all the transitions are much broader than their thermal line width , @xmath67 , suggesting a significant contribution from nonthermal motions .",
    "our @xmath5 spectra also have larger line widths when compared to the @xmath68 spectra observed with the very large array ( vla ) and the effelsberg 100 m telescope ( pillai et  al . 2007 ; wang et  al . 2008 ) . since the two transitions have similar upper state energies , @xmath69 for @xmath1 and @xmath70 for @xmath11 , but fairly different critical densities , @xmath71 for @xmath1 ( daniel et  al . 2005 ; pagani et  al .",
    "2009 ) and @xmath72 for @xmath11 ( evans 1999 ) , our @xmath1 observations tend to trace denser clumps possibly embedded in the inner region that is affected by star - forming activities as suggested by @xmath73 masers ( wang et  al .",
    "observations of lower @xmath55 transitions of @xmath1 such as the @xmath74 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) line are needed to verify this interpretation .",
    "the deuterium fractionation , @xmath16 , is calculated for every source ( table  [ table_smtfits ] ) and shows a significant enhancement of roughly 3 orders of magnitude higher than the average @xmath3 ratio of @xmath14 in the local interstellar medium ( oliveira et  al .",
    "such an enhancement has been observed in a large sample of high - mass star - forming cores ( fontani et  al .",
    "2006 ) as well as low - mass prestellar and protostellar cores ( crapsi et  al . 2005 ; roberts & millar 2007 ; emprechtinger et  al .",
    "in particular , we find a decreasing trend with evolutionary stage , from @xmath77 in the younger mm9 core to @xmath78 in the more evolved mm1 core , a change over a factor of roughly @xmath79 . although a decreasing trend over a factor of roughly @xmath80 has been identified in low - mass protostellar cores ( emprechtinger et  al . 2009 ) , there was no evidence for such trend in a sample of massive star - forming cores associated with different molecular clouds ( fontani et  al .",
    "variations in thermal history , external environment , and initial chemical abundances across different molecular clouds may cause undesired confusion .",
    "although our sample contains only three sources , the association in one single irdc helps to minimize the environmental variations among the sources and to reveal the gentle drop in deuterium fractionation as the dusty envelope warms up .      using the sma , we further imaged the @xmath1 and @xmath2 emission to study more centrally concentrated structures .",
    "the @xmath1 emission shows clear detections in mm1 and mm4 as well as a marginal detection in mm9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_g28n2hp ] ) .",
    "since an interferometer is insensitive to structures larger than the scale corresponding to its shortest projected baseline , our sma observations serve as a spatial filter to probe the fractional flux contained in clumps smaller than 8  ( wilner & welch 1994 ) .",
    "a comparison of the integrated intensity observed with the sma , @xmath81 , to that with the smt , @xmath82 , can be made by convolving the sma maps with the smt beam after masking out regions below @xmath83 , which are believed to be artifacts induced by the lack of short baselines .",
    "for every source , we compare the @xmath1 integrated intensity observed with the sma to that with the smt ( fig .",
    "[ fig_g28smt ] ) and estimate the fraction of the sma integrated intensity , @xmath84 , which indicates the state of a mass concentration process ( table  [ table_mms ] ) .",
    "the small values of @xmath84 suggest that most of the @xmath1 emission is in structures larger than 8 .",
    "an increasing trend from mm9 to mm1 is found and agrees with the presumed evolutionary stage of the central sources . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath2 is not detected in all regions at a level of @xmath85 , translating to an upper limit of @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "compared to the smt integrated intensity in mm9 , this detection limit sets a maximum fraction of 19% for emission coming from compact structures .",
    "given the high critical density of @xmath71 , the large fraction of the @xmath88 emission missed by the sma observations strongly suggests the presence of cold and dense gas in scales larger than 8  ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "similar to @xmath1 , most of the @xmath2 emission is in extended structures .",
    "continuum emissions at @xmath89 and @xmath90 are detected in all sources with similar morphology .",
    "for the first time , a compact continuum source is detected in mm9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_g28n2hp ] ) . since the visibility coverages of the two observation runs were quite different , we made continuum maps with visibilities of projected baselines within @xmath91 , the range that all sources have in common at the two frequencies . if the dust emission is optically thin , the continuum flux density @xmath92 , where @xmath93 ( shepherd & watson 2002 ) is the dust opacity at the observing frequency @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the planck function at a dust temperature @xmath96 .",
    "the opacity spectral index , @xmath97 , can be measured by comparing flux densities at two observing frequencies . in cold clouds , the condition @xmath98 makes the rayleigh - jeans approximation inappropriate .",
    "we estimate the opacity spectral index in the selected regions with @xmath99}{\\log ( \\nu_2/\\nu_1 ) } - 3,\\ ] ] and the core mass with @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the distance of the source . assuming thermal equilibrium between gas and dust over similar spatial scales in the calculations of @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    ", we adopt the gas temperature derived from the vla ammonia observations with a comparable angular resolution of @xmath104 ( zhang et  al .",
    "2009 ) to be the dust temperature , @xmath96 .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ table_mms ] .",
    "because of the limited frequency span of @xmath105 , we note that a systematic uncertainty of 15% in flux density measurements will produce a fairly large uncertainty of @xmath106 in our calculations .",
    "the dust opacity spectral index shows an increasing trend from mm9 to mm1 as the central sources evolve although the multiplicity in mm4 may complicate the interpretation of its averaged @xmath102 .",
    "nevertheless , a smaller value of @xmath102 is observed in mm9 with respect to mm1 . at millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "the value of @xmath102 is a good probe for the size distribution of dust grains ( miyake & nakagawa 1993 ) , and a smaller @xmath102 suggests that mm9 is surrounded by larger dust grains as a result of grain growth in high - density environment . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger @xmath102 in the more evolved region mm1 may be attributed to possible changes in the size distribution and chemical composition of the surrounding dust grains , which have been exposed to strong radiation fields generated by the associated massive ysos .      in cold , dense environment",

    "when the internal heating of ysos becomes important , the temperature will rise up and lead to sublimation of ice mantle , which returns volatile species such as co back to the gas phase .",
